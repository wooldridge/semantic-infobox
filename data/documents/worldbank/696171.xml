This report is based on the findings of a joint IBRD-OECF appraisal mission which visited the Philippines in ApriUMay&#13;
1996, comprising Mmes./Messrs. F. Delannoy (Task Manager, EA1HR), B. Bidani (Economics, ASTHR), M. Lockheed&#13;
(Education, HDD), J. Kirk (Distance Education, Consultant), J. Renner (Management, Consultant), S. Theunynck (Civil&#13;
Works/ Implementation, Consultant) and C. Vales (Resident Mission). OECF was represented by Messrs. Shimokawa&#13;
and Kabayashi and Ms. Muto. Project design and preparation were partly funded by Japan, AusAID, CIDA,&#13;
UNDP/UNICEF, UNESCO France and ADB. The underlying sector work was conducted by a Filipino team led by Mr.&#13;
E. Barzaga (Innotech-Seamao) with support from V. Ordonez (UNESCO), and assistance from J. Fernandez and for the&#13;
Bank by A. Schwartz (PSP) and J-P. Tan (HDD). Preparation was led by Ms. Lourdes G. de Vera and Mr. J. Mateo&#13;
(DECS) under the leadership of Mrs. L. Pefianco (DECS Undersecretary) and with the assistance of Mr. M. Taguiwalo&#13;
(Economist), University Ateneo de Manila, and the Philippines Business for Social Progress. Valuable comments/inputs&#13;
were contributed by B. Alano (sustainability analysis, consultant), B. Diokno (devolution), A. Christensen (Indigenous&#13;
people and resettlement, ASTHR), H. Patrinos (demand-side financing, HDD), E. Heneveld/H. Craig/Y. Zeeger/R.&#13;
Matthews/A. Burke (schools and teachers), N. Jangira/G. Wall (pedagogical decentralization), 1. Montagnes (textbooks),&#13;

PHILIPPINES&#13;
THIRD ELEMENTARY EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
1. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1   Following a decade of reform and restructuring, the Philippine economy is well on the&#13;
path to recovery. GNP growth started accelerating in 1994, reached 5.5 percent in 1995 and is&#13;
projected at 6.5-7 percent for 1996. The prospects for sustaining this trend are better than at any&#13;
time since the debt crisis of the early 80s. They will depend on Government's ability to maintain&#13;
appropriate macroeconomic policies, pursue its economic liberalization program and intensify&#13;
the fight against poverty.&#13;
1.2   Poverty is still the Philippines' major development challenge, with over one third of&#13;
households classified as "poor" (1994). The problem is concentrated in the rural areas, where&#13;
two thirds of the poor live, and over half of the population is poor. Rural poverty reflects both&#13;
lower average incomes and more severe income disparities than in the country as a whole.&#13;
Poverty declined by about 0.7 percent per annum during 1971-91, a modest record by East Asian&#13;
standards.&#13;
1.3   Average educational indicators are favorable in quantitative terms, particularly for a&#13;
country at that income level (GNP per capita: US$1,134 in 1995). In 1995, the Philippines was&#13;
ranked the third most schooled nation in Asia, after Brunei and Korea, both with a much higher&#13;
per capita income (UNESCO). However, national and even regional averages obscure wide&#13;
discrepancies in access to quality education which coincide with the poverty map. Almost all&#13;
children enter elementary school, but one-third drop out. They come disproportionately from&#13;
poor families and economically depressed areas, as shown by the completion rates, which range&#13;
from nearly 100 in the National Capital Region (NCR) to below 30 percent in parts of Eastern&#13;
Visayas and Mindanao. Education is not the only factor explaining income differentials, but&#13;
when combined with a low level of agricultural investment, it has condemned rural youths to a&#13;
life of poverty. Poverty incidence is 65 percent among households whose heads have less than&#13;
five years of education.&#13;
1.4    The Government of the Philippines (GoP) is aware that the existence of large&#13;
concentrations of poverty and low levels of education is not only inequitable, but also poses a&#13;
threat to social stability, investor sentiment and economic competitiveness. It has declared&#13;
poverty reduction one of its highest priorities for the remaining period of its tenure, and has&#13;
developed a strategy to that effect, the Social Reform Agenda (1994). The SRA aims to share&#13;
the benefits of growth more equitably, while involving the poor more actively in the&#13;
development process. It is a geographically targeted program which combines measures to&#13;
expand economic opportunities in depressed rural areas, provide basic social services to improve&#13;
the human capital of the poor, and promote democratic governance. The proposed operation of&#13;
the Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) is the first GoP SRA project. It begins&#13;
tackling the central issue of low completion rates and low learning achievements among rural&#13;
children, as a first step towards helping them break the cycle of poverty.&#13;

2. THE ELEMENTARY EDUCATION SYSTEM&#13;
A. OVERVIEW&#13;
2.1    The Philippines education system, one of the most mature in Asia, can boast impressive&#13;
quantitative achievements. Universal access to elementary education was reached as early as the&#13;
mid-60s; the adult basic literacy rate is about 93 percent (1990); enrollments in higher education&#13;
are among the highest in the developing world, and private sector participation is strong,&#13;
especially at the post-primary level. The following table summarizes the key sectoral data.&#13;

2.2   Elementary education consists of six grades. However, rural areas have some 4,400&#13;
"incomplete" schools, i.e., limited to the first four grades, and 11,000 multigrade schools, where&#13;
one teacher handles two or more grades. The average pupil:teacher ratio is 1:33, with wide&#13;
regional variations. The admission age was lowered from 7 to 6 years in SY95/96. The stated&#13;
gross elementary enrollment ratio is high (112 percent) as is the net enrollment ratio&#13;
("participation rate") at 87 percent, but they still leave 1.5 million 7-12 year olds, the hardest to&#13;
reach, out of school. By contrast with most developing countries, girls are more schooled than&#13;
boys. Basic Data are in Annex 1.&#13;
2.3   DECS administers and supervises elementary and secondary education. As of to-day,&#13;
line authority extends from DECS Central Office through 16 Regional Offices to 134 provincial&#13;
and city School Divisional Offices, down to some 2,100 District Offices which oversee about 15-&#13;
20 public elementary schools each. The roles of the various layers of the education system are&#13;
being redefined to make the School Divisions the key operational level (para. 3.23). GoP&#13;
proposes to implement this reorganization via administrative, rather than legislative channels.&#13;
B. ISSUES IN ELEMENTARY EDUCATION&#13;
2.4   The downside of the GoP's mass-education strategy has been a continuous decline in&#13;
quality which has hurt the poor more than any other group (1991 Report of the Congress&#13;
Education Commission, or EDCOM Report). For long the impact was not felt because slow&#13;
growth and import-substitution development strategies failed to create high productivity&#13;
employment, forcing 4 million Filipinos to take their skills abroad. Social rate of returns on&#13;
education decreased, educational investment stagnated and outcomes declined. But this seemed&#13;
irrelevant since anyway, many people were trapped in low paying agricultural or informal urban&#13;
sector jobs. Thus, the Philippines failed to capture the benefits normally associated with&#13;
education-productivity growth, poverty reduction, economic and social development. Now that&#13;
the export-led pattern of growth adopted by GoP is accelerating the demand for labor, low&#13;
educational quality is increasingly identified by business as a major impediment to catching up&#13;
with the East Asia "miracle" countries, which have achieved growth and equity. The two main&#13;
issues in elementary education are variations in outcomes and adverse social selectivity (paras.&#13;
2.5-2.9). Paras. 2.10-2.23 discuss the root causes.&#13;
Wide Variations in Outcomes&#13;
2.5   Education quantitative indicators are good on average, but analyses at the provincial level&#13;
or below reveal wide qualitative disparities which are poverty-related. Most children have access&#13;
to a school, but only 68 percent complete elementary education. For many of those who&#13;
complete, little learning takes place. Recent international comparisons of math, science and&#13;
reading among 9 and 14 years old show not only a low mean score for Filipino children - two&#13;
standard deviations below the sample mean - but greater variations around the mean, both of&#13;
student scores and school scores. The urban/rural differences were particularly pronounced.&#13;
This suggests that raising quality would require not only increasing average performance but also&#13;
reducing variations across students and schools by targeting the worst schools. By contrast with&#13;
many African or Latin American countries, repetition is not a major cause of drop-out. Children&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
either are promoted - over 89 percent of the graduates complete the cycle in six years - or are&#13;
allowed to drop out, as poor achievements reflect badly on teacher's performance. About 60&#13;
percent of the drop-out happens in Grades I and II, another eight percent before Grade 4. The 2.8&#13;
years spent in school by the drop-outs are not enough for them to remain literate.&#13;
2.6   The disparities in public schooling outcomes are reflected in social indicators. In well-off&#13;
provinces, higher educational attainment and achievements lead to improved adult health status,&#13;
lower fertility levels and reduced malnutrition; better nutrition enhances pupils' ability to learn;&#13;
children who have a positive schooling experience stay longer in school, as in a seamless web.&#13;
In very poor provinces such as Abra, Masbate, or Zamboaga, up to 50 percent of the children are&#13;
malnourished, completion rates can fall as low as 25 percent, and achievement levels, as low as&#13;
36 percent of curriculum objectives. There is a strong negative correlation between fertility,&#13;
infant mortality, on one hand, and elementary school completion on the other hand.&#13;
Social Selectivity in Elementary School Completion&#13;
2.7   The education system is structurally equitable in terms of the budget share allocated to&#13;
each level, but socially regressive. Children from poor families are ill -prepared for learning and&#13;
have no choice but to go to public schools, which tend to offer lower quality education than the&#13;
better endowed private schools.  The quality gap is larger in rural areas, because of an&#13;
inequitable, pupil-based resource allocation mechanism that puts small schools at a&#13;
disadvantage.  The poor are trapped in a vicious circle: they learn little at school, get&#13;
discouraged, drop-out early and, with little education, have limited earning power, perpetuating&#13;
the cycle of poverty for their offspring. The probability of drop-out for a first grader from a low-&#13;
income farming family is almost 20 percent, versus less than 5 percent for a child from an urban&#13;
educated background.&#13;
2.8   Poor youngsters face additional handicaps.  First, even in public schools, parents&#13;
contribute on average one-third of total costs; consequently, public elementary education costs&#13;
more to low-income households, as a proportion of their budget, than private education to the&#13;
rich. Second, poor children have to work: nearly half of 7-12 year olds, especially boys, are&#13;
engaged in home production, contributing up to 25 percent of family income; almost one-fourth&#13;
do market work, which keeps them at peak season, and sometimes permanently, out of school;&#13;
child labor is not uncommon. For these families, the private costs of public education (para.&#13;
2.12) are simply unaffordable. Combined low quality and high cost, in a context of economic&#13;
hardship and lack of job opportunities, make elementary school attendance a waste of time and&#13;
have generated a decline in demand.&#13;
2.9   Adverse social selectivity works mainly along poverty, not gender lines. In 1994, girls&#13;
accounted for 49.5 percent, 51.5 percent and 56.3 percent of enrollments in elementary,&#13;
secondary and tertiary education. In 1992, among the 30 percent poorest, 7.6 percent of 7-12&#13;
year-old boys, and 6.1 percent of girls, were out of school. The percentages jump to 29.2 percent&#13;
and 19.5 percent for the 13-16 year old group. On the other hand, among the poor, some groups&#13;
face particular odds because of size, geographical isolation, language, or lifestyle. They include:&#13;
children of ethnic minorities such as the Ifugaos in the North, nomadic tribes such as the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
Manobos in Mindanao, migrant workers ("sacada") in the plantations of Visayas, and boys&#13;
engaged in child labor. Table 2.2 summarizes why children from the 30 percent lowest per&#13;
capita income group are not in school. It shows that significantly reducing the drop-out rates will&#13;
require interventions that (a) make the schooling experience more interesting; (b) bring schools&#13;
closer to the barangays (village); and (c) address demand-side issues (health, nutrition, cost of&#13;
education). These findings have shaped the design of the proposed operation.&#13;

The Root Causes: Macro Constraints Erode Equity&#13;
2.10  The Impact of Poverty. The declining human capital of the poor is the legacy of years of&#13;
neglect, followed by a period of slow and erratic growth which frustrated the major commitments&#13;
of the Aquino Administration in favor of the social sectors. During the 70s and 80s, negative per&#13;
capita growth reduced per pupil public investment in education, per capita income, and, as&#13;
income distribution remains very skewed, the amounts that poor households can invest in the&#13;
education of their children. Part of the problem is therefore of a macro nature. While most of the&#13;
urban poor could be pulled out of their predicament by sustained, export-led growth, improving&#13;
the lot of the poorest, most of whom live in rural areas, will require increased rural investments&#13;
and the provision of basic social services, as proposed under this project. Access to quality&#13;
education and health is a key determinant of life expectancy, life quality, and labor productivity,&#13;
influencing the extent to which individuals are prepared to invest in their own human capital.&#13;
2.11   Unbalanced, Inequitable Public Funding. A 1996 Bank study on "Education Financing&#13;
and Social Equity: A Reform Agenda" confirmed that the Filipinos are highly committed to&#13;
education, as reflected in the 6 percent of GNP the nation allocates to the sector. However, the&#13;
public contribution, at 2.8 percent of GNP, is still below the Asian average of 3.4 percent, and is&#13;
not sufficient to correct market failures. This is not for lack of effort: public sectoral spending&#13;
grew by nearly 12 percent in real terms during 1985-95. However, the impact was more&#13;
remedial than developmental; the increase was stop-go and most of it was absorbed by a 76&#13;
percent increase in teacher salaries, the nationalization of locally-funded village high schools,&#13;
and the introduction of a voucher system in support of free universal secondary education.&#13;
2.12  The pattern of sectoral spending raises two issues. First, by level of education, it has&#13;
become less pro-poor, with the share of elementary education declining from 60 to 47 percent&#13;
during the past 11 years. The percentage is still enviable, but equity has suffered, as elementary&#13;
education is the only schooling 60 percent of the poor receive. By type of expenditure, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
pattern has become increasingly incompatible with the delivery of quality, as salaries (85 percent&#13;
of DECS 1995 Budget) have crowded out other expenditures, especially instructional materials.&#13;
In 1995, the Maintenance and Other Operating Expenditures (MOOE) allocation of 125 Pesos&#13;
(US$5.0) at the elementary level was insufficient to provide the "interesting" learning&#13;
environment needed to keep poor children in school. Second, GoP's difficulties in meeting&#13;
education's financing requirements since the late 80s have been compensated by an increasing&#13;
involvement of the Local Government Units (LGUs) and the private sector. This could lead to&#13;
greater efficiency but may also exacerbate inequities.  LGU financing since the Local&#13;
Government Code (LGC) was promulgated in 1991 increased from 2 to 9 percent of total public&#13;
sector spending. As all LGUs contribute according to means, and GOP's allocations are pupil-&#13;
based, excluding any mechanism to compensate for the narrow resource base of poor LGUs or&#13;
for the small student body of rural schools, the educational quality gap between affluent and poor&#13;
schools is likely to widen. As for private funding, it increased from 18 to 31 percent of total&#13;
expenditures on elementary education, further contributing to the propensity of poor children to&#13;
dropping out.&#13;
2.13  What are GoP's options to redress the present inequities? Neither the share of the total&#13;
budget allocated to education (26 percent in 1995), nor the contribution of private education&#13;
(Table 1) can be raised much further. Three promising avenues would be to: (a) reallocate&#13;
resources from the State Universities and Colleges, which have high unit costs and absorb 16&#13;
percent of total GoP educational expenditures; (b) revise staff deployment practices and norms&#13;
for allocating resources to schools, which are cost-ineffective and put small rural schools at a&#13;
disadvantage; and (c) tap those LGUs which are able and willing to pay for improved services,&#13;
while targeting available resources at those most in need. The project will help DECS achieve a&#13;
more equitable, efficient and balanced spending pattern.&#13;
2.14 The Challenges and Opportunities of Devolution. Although education is one of the few&#13;
non devolved sectors, the 1991 LGC established two elements of a decentralized framework for&#13;
education: (a) the provincial, city or municipality School Boards, co-chaired by the LGU and&#13;
DECS authorities, which allocate LGU funding to the sector: and (b) a Special Education Fund&#13;
(SEF) maintained in each provincial, city or municipality treasury and administered by the&#13;
corresponding School Board. The LGC is under review and it is expected that more educational&#13;
functions -- except for teacher salaries -- will be decentralized. The LGU contribution to&#13;
education is strikingly complementary to that of Central Government, with its focus on non-&#13;
salary expenditures, MOOE and capital outlay. It also offers potentialfor expanding elementary&#13;
education financing. Mobilizing additional LGU resources for education should be facilitated by&#13;
the fact that financial transfers to LGUs will increase sharply in the years ahead. The project will&#13;
introduce, for school construction and maintenance, a Central/Local Government cost-sharing&#13;
ratio which will increase public education financing and make it more progressive.&#13;
2.15  Traditional Management Style. With 45 percent of the civil service, DECS is the largest&#13;
GoP Department. Its bureaucratic, complex management practices do not meet the needs of a&#13;
large, diverse country undergoing rapid decentralization or the demands of a modernizing&#13;
economy, both of which require flexibility. Neither are they designed to correct educational&#13;
inequities. Decision-making remains centralized and top-down and involves many levels (1993&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I                                      - 7 -&#13;
Internal Audit). The Regional Offices are too remote from classrooms and absorb 30 percent of&#13;
resources. Another problem area is the limited use of the massive amount of data collected from&#13;
the field for decision-making. There is no institutional capacity to prepare analyses for the&#13;
Secretary. The need for rigorous measurement of impact and costs is not fully appreciated; for&#13;
instance, the population-based assessment system is costly and does not generate timely&#13;
diagnostic information. The weak budget monitoring procedures result in underspending.&#13;
Finally, DECS is still the sole provider of support services, such as testing or in-service training,&#13;
which outsourcing could improve. Physical planning is still based on standardized norms rather&#13;
than actual needs. In particular, pupil-based MOOE allocation and staffing norms for teachers&#13;
and principals affects the quality and effectiveness of school and classroom management and&#13;
ultimately, schooling outcomes, preventing the reduction of disparities. The system is more&#13;
oriented towards control than support, and activities than results. Most DECS' managers and&#13;
professionals are former teachers with limited training in their new responsibilities. DECS&#13;
leadership is aware of these problems and plans to use the project to address them through a&#13;
major capacity-building effort.&#13;
Sectoral Factors Reinforce the Disparities in Access to Educational Quality Inputs&#13;
2.16 A 1993 "fast-track" assessment of 16,000 Grade VI pupils found that only 29 percent of&#13;
the 131 competencies tested were learned. In 1994 provincial test scores ranged from 54 in&#13;
Masbate to 102 in the National Capital. The following paragraphs explore why.&#13;
2.17 Inequities in Readiness for School and Teachability. Poor children in rural areas enter&#13;
school late (7 years old or more), frequently come from functionally illiterate homes, and, having&#13;
seldom attended early childhood or pre-school programs, have not had previous exposure to&#13;
English or Tagalog, the two languages of instruction. One project study found that even one&#13;
year of preschool raises learning, especially in the early grades and in language skills, and&#13;
reduces the likelihood of drop-out by one-third. Pupils also miss school and eventually drop out&#13;
because of easily treatable diseases such as respiratory infections and diarrhea. One third--and&#13;
up to half in pockets of extreme poverty such as Leyte or Masbate--suffer from protein-energy&#13;
malnutrition (PEM) and micronutrient deficiencies. This slows down intellectual development&#13;
and depresses the immune system, making poor pupils more likely to underperform and more&#13;
vulnerable to disease. To address demand issues, the project will pilot research-based targeted&#13;
interventions.&#13;
2.18  Inequitable Access to Basic Inputs. Due to distribution problems, remote schools only&#13;
have a few textbooks per class (one book for 3-6 children in the project's six pilot provinces),&#13;
and the books lack relevance to a rural environment. Teaching aids are scarce, mostly teacher-&#13;
made, and libraries are thinly stocked. A major development is that under a recently passed law,&#13;
the textbook publishing sector for public schools, hitherto under government monopoly, is to be&#13;
entirely privatized over the next three years. Schools will select books from a DECS-approved&#13;

(IREDU) and J-P Tan (World Bank), 1995. Available in the Project File.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
list. This reform, which in the long-run is likely to promote an already vibrant national&#13;
publishing industry, for the short term generates uncertainty regarding the price of books and&#13;
their delivery to isolated areas. It also calls for new skills, systems and procedures if the&#13;
transition is to be orderly. The project will build on analytical inputs provided to GoP by the&#13;
Canadian Government in the area of publishing.&#13;
2.19   Pedagogical Constraints. Rural schools, which in most cases have no principal to provide&#13;
instructional leadership, no MOOE to purchase materials, and are rarely supervised, also have&#13;
beginner teachers. Equipped with a limited repertoire of classroom management skills, those&#13;
teachers have to practice multigrade teaching without proper equipment and preparation despite&#13;
the noteworthy effort of UNICEF which has trained and equipped about 9,000 teachers. This&#13;
explains why multigrade is perceived by parents and teachers as second-rate education. Young&#13;
teachers are also thrown into a rigid prescriptive pedagogic system which does not develop&#13;
initiative. In-service training remains supply-driven, teacher and subject-centered, underfunded&#13;
and biased towards urban teachers. Other constraints are systemwide but particularly affect&#13;
small rural schools because of their isolation and limited resources. For instance, the curriculum&#13;
emphasizes "Minimum learning competencies", instead of developing individual students' full&#13;
potential, and needs to be refocused on core disciplines. The school calendar was extended in&#13;
1993, but teachers are overburdened with extracurricular activities which leave little time for&#13;
reflective, individual or group learning. The early, formative grades do not get enough attention.&#13;
Tlhe project will approach these issues by revitalizing in-service training in support of&#13;
pedagogical decentralization (paras. 2.26-2.27).&#13;
2.20 In poor schools, the dilapidated physical environment is not conducive to learning. The&#13;
regional distribution of schools and furniture bears little or no relationship with poverty or school&#13;
participation. Furthermore, the needs for maintenance and replacement are considerable, as one&#13;
third of the existing 305,000 classrooms are over 15-20 years old, and most were built to low&#13;
quality standards. Nearly one-fourth of total capacity cannot be used as classrooms, so that the&#13;
pupil/classroom ratio averages 42, with wide regional variations. Almost half of the schools&#13;
have no water, and 61 percent, no electricity. All lack modem means of communications.&#13;
Access per se is not an issue, but access to quality, and to a "complete" school offering six&#13;
grades, is. Low completion rates and the high incidence of overage children (40 percent in&#13;
Mindanao) are linked to distance from a properly equipped, albeit small, school offering all six&#13;
grades (21 percent of grade VI pupils walk over one hour). However, the current school map&#13;
reflects a preference for large "central" or "model" schools located near urban centers and better&#13;
endowed to provide quality education. Offering small multigrade schools closer to the barangays&#13;
would reduce the capital and recurrent costs associated with monograde teaching. The same&#13;
classroom design is used throughout the country, whatever the physical and climatic conditions.&#13;
In the project's six pilot provinces, the desk:pupils ratio is about 1: 4. A preparation study 6&#13;
found that desks and furniture were as cost-effective as workbooks in raising learning. About&#13;
75-85 percent of school sites are untitled, but DECS has put in place a legal, albeit lengthy&#13;

process, to ensure that at least for new sites there is evidence of clear title, and displaced&#13;
individuals, if any, are properly compensated.&#13;
Need for Greater Attention to Micro Factors&#13;
2.21  In-School Factors. A complete quality improvement strategy must go beyond the mere&#13;
provision of inputs to improve the way these are managed at the school level. Particularly&#13;
critical to shifting from "status quo" to dynamic and adaptive schools is the lack of principals.&#13;
Only one school in four has a principal, and most rural schools do not A preparation study7&#13;
comparing 11 high-performing and 8 low-performing schools (HPS, LPS) found that HPS have&#13;
entrepreneurial principals who exercise instructional and administrative leadership, create a sense&#13;
of discipline, purpose and teamwork and forge partnerships with the communities. However,&#13;
there is no systematic program to identify and nurture leadership. Under the project, school&#13;
clusters will be assigned one principal, pilot schools will be empowered, and&#13;
management/leadership training will be provided.&#13;
2.22 Weak Community Participation Community and parental involvement, which correlates&#13;
positively with ownership, financial support and school outcomes, is consistently more limited&#13;
in poorer communities. Project studies report acts of vandalism against school facilities and&#13;
parents shunning PTA meetings. There is no systematic school-level mechanism to advise and&#13;
control the principal. In recent years, neither communities nor Municipal Engineering Offices&#13;
(MEOs) have been involved in school construction, although both would be interested in the&#13;
economic benefits and the MEOs have the technical capacity. School construction has been the&#13;
responsibility of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH); it represents a minor&#13;
fraction of DPWH's workload (5-10 percent) and has received commensurate attention.&#13;
Community and parental involvement is even weaker--and practically non-existent--in&#13;
pedagogical decisions. Participation is critical to the sustainability of the project, and has been&#13;
built into its design, from planning through implementation.&#13;
2.23  Child Labor and Other Demand-side Constraints. The best strategy to address demand-&#13;
side issues (para. 2.8) is to raise the quality of education so that attending school is worth the&#13;
opportunity cost, and to reduce the private cost of schooling to make it affordable to poor&#13;
families. A case study of child labor is under preparation to design workable solutions. The&#13;
elementary education development plans prepared by the six project pilot provinces all include&#13;
requests for "special programs" in health, nutrition, interventions for ethnic minority children and&#13;
migrant laborers. These programs will initially be treated as pilots.&#13;
C. GOVERNMENT SUB-SECTORAL STRATEGY&#13;
2.24  GoP's five-pronged strategy for elementary education reaffirms long-standing principles&#13;
and incorporates new ones. (a) The commitment to elementary education as the funding priority&#13;

is embodied in the 1987 Constitution, and has been revived by the EDCOM and Education-for-&#13;
All Reports and the SRA. (b) The trend towards decentralization dates back to the mid-70s and&#13;
is now being carried below the regional level to the provinces, under the new impetus given by&#13;
the 1991 LGC. (c) On the other hand, the use of participatory approaches reflects the&#13;
empowerment policies of the Aquino and Ramos Administrations, while (d) the "Effective&#13;
School' thrust and the new emphasis on diversified solutions, experimentation and&#13;
(e) measurement build on recent worldwide education research findings. In recent years, isolated&#13;
steps have been taken to improve quality. DECS was split in three to concentrate on Basic&#13;
Education only, teacher salaries have been increased, the school year lengthened, and private&#13;
sector regulations relaxed. The impact of these measures is not known. Preparation of this&#13;
project has, however, provided a strategic opportunity to align all the elements of the system&#13;
towards the goal of quality education, especially for the poor, and to rally the donors. The full&#13;
strategy, which builds on work done by DECS, not only with the Bank, but also with Australian,&#13;
Canadian, Irish, Japanese bilateral aid, and with ADB, UNDP and UNICEF, is detailed below. It&#13;
will be tested in the most challenging provinces under TEEP and generalized if successful.&#13;
2.25 Improving Sectoral Funding. To correct inequities in access to quality inputs, GoP will&#13;
use the budget for social targeting and will tap additional sources of public funds. The plan is to:&#13;
(a) maintain education's share in the Central Government budget (26 percent); (b) within this,&#13;
restore the share allocated to elementary education in the mid-80s (60 percent) and increase the&#13;
proportion of this going to the 26 provinces from 17 to no less than 20 percent; (c) introduce a&#13;
progressive cost-sharing formula between central and local governments to target resources on&#13;
poorer LGUs and expand the elementary education allocation by devolving school&#13;
construction/maintenance (1997); (d) increase the MOOE allocation; (e) improve expenditure&#13;
efficiency by rationalizing the staffing norms; and (f) create a School Improvement and&#13;
Innovation Facility (SIIF) to further target the more marginalized schools.&#13;
2.26 School-based Quality Improvement. The strategy to increase achievements and retention&#13;
is the 'Effective School" framework in which schools are the locus of an active, organic process&#13;
of transformning inputs into pupils' learning. It proposes to: (a) give all children easy access&#13;
(1 hour's walk) to a complete school, mono or multigrade, providing quality education; (b) create&#13;
school clusters to organize a demand-driven process of in-service training and to facilitate&#13;
frequent, supportive supervision; instructional (internal) leadership will be provided in rural&#13;
schools, by district supervisors and in urban schools, by principals; (c) equip each school,&#13;
classroom and pupil with a basic kit of instructional material; (d) give schools more autonomy&#13;
and flexibility (with respect to MOOE, school attendance calendar, the extra-curricular demands&#13;
on teachers, time on task, and indigenization of up to 30 percent of the curriculum where so&#13;
desired by communities); (f) develop a successful multigrade model; (g) expand community-&#13;
based ECD/pre-schooling programs targeted at the poorest; and (h) use SIIF grants to encourage&#13;
schools to introduce instruction-related innovation that reflect their unique circumstances.&#13;
2.27 Management Decentralization. To support this focus, TEEP will bring the level of&#13;
decision-making closer to the school and the community. The School Divisions (Provinces and&#13;
Cities) are becoming the basic operational units to plan, implement, monitor and manage&#13;
education programs delivered by the schools. Over time, more responsibility may be shifted to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
the District level. Some schools will selectively be "empowered", e.g., in fiscal and pedagogical&#13;
management, under different organizational models giving more or less power to the principal&#13;
and the School's Management Advisory Committee. The role of the Regional Offices will be&#13;
reoriented to facilitate this transition. Appropriate skills, systems and procedures will be&#13;
developed to delegate operational functions to lower levels, allowing the Central Office of DECS&#13;
to concentrate on its strategic, regulatory and resource mobilization roles.&#13;
2.28 Partnerships with Stakeholders. To ensure sustainability, TEEP will mobilize the&#13;
communities in support of schools. It proposes to: (a) involve DECS Divisional Offices, LGU&#13;
and community officials in the preparation of the DEDPs; (b) have the LGUs contribute to the&#13;
financing and implementation of the school construction/ maintenance program, as a step&#13;
towards devolution; (c) use the existing provincial and municipal School Boards, and create&#13;
"School Management Advisory Committees", to exercise "democratic oversight" and to deepen&#13;
parental and community involvement in all aspects of school life, such as the delivery of&#13;
textbooks; (d) recruit NGOs for the independent monitoring of relatively non-technical aspects of&#13;
school and classroom processes; and (e) mobilize corporate funding.&#13;
2.29 Measuring Impact and Cost to Guide Decision-Making. To better target resources,&#13;
determine whether to institutionalize or to drop the pilot experiments, and increase accountability&#13;
and transparency, TEEP will promote information-based decision-making. It will introduce:&#13;
(a) a sample-based assessment system to provide educators with rapidly usable diagnostic&#13;
information; (b) a user-friendly MIS tailored to the needs of policy-makers and implementing&#13;
Divisions; and (c) procedures to monitor, communicate and inform stakeholders and the public&#13;
about project actions, their impact and cost.&#13;
D. BANK STRATEGY&#13;
2.30 The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (February 15, 1996) was prepared following a&#13;
participatory approach. Now that the fiscal crises of the past are under control, the strategy&#13;
stresses macroeconomic stability and the quality of the development process. Its five objectives&#13;
are to: (a) help the GoP maintain sound macro policies to convert the current economic recovery&#13;
into a period of sustained growth; (b) strengthen the public sector's implementing capacity;&#13;
(c) improve the country's infrastructure to promote private sector-led growth; (d) support&#13;
sustainable management of natural resources and protect the environment; and (e) design and&#13;
implement better mechanisms to reduce poverty and upgrade the quality of basic services for the&#13;
poor.&#13;
2.31  Because of the need to be selective, for the short-term the Bank's social sector program is&#13;
geared towards the CAS' poverty objective. One of the three recommendations of the Bank's&#13;
1996 "Strategy to Fight Poverty" is to provide quality basic social services to the poor. In line&#13;
with this recommendation, the proposed Third Elementary Education Project and an Early&#13;
Childhood Development (ECD) Project under preparation will target interventions in health,&#13;
nutrition and cognitive development on the most vulnerable, highest pay-off group, namely&#13;
young children from poor families. In both cases the Bank is helping GoP to strengthen the&#13;
strategic framework for addressing inequities, to develop cost-effective delivery mechanisms,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
and to mobilize soft money. As pilots being tested in the SRA provinces prior to adoption in&#13;
other poor provinces, these interventions will have a large multiplier effect. In parallel, the Bank&#13;
is using non-lending services for building analytical and implementation capacities in the social&#13;
sectors. One Institutional Development Fund Grant is assisting the Central Agencies with&#13;
poverty monitoring and targeting, while another one under preparation will help sharpen their&#13;
human resource development strategy and investment program. Supervision of an Engineering&#13;
and Science Education Project (Ln. 3435-PH) and a Second Vocational Technical Project&#13;
(Cr.2392-PH) provides a platform for an on-going dialogue on skills for global competitiveness&#13;
in a rapidly changing environment.&#13;
E. LESSONS LEARNED FROM PAST OPERATIONS&#13;
2.32 Projects in the Philippines. The eleven projects implemented since 1965 (totaling about&#13;
US$553 million) provide many relevant lessons, especially the 1981 Sector Program for&#13;
Decentralized Elementary Education (PRODED) and the 1991 Second Elementary Education&#13;
Project (SEEP)8. On simple project elements such as school construction, Filipinos have a good&#13;
mastery of the required techniques, and even a change in approach as proposed here can be easily&#13;
absorbed. On the other hand, qualitative objectives have been elusive, and more complex&#13;
interventions such as targeting, monitoring and evaluation require more thorough, practical&#13;
preparation (e.g., a school-map, rather than an elaborate mathematical formula) and supervision.&#13;
Another lesson is that participation in project design is essential to avoid stakeholder resistance,&#13;
and for effective implementation. PRODED would have benefited, had it been implemented on a&#13;
geographically and chronologically phased basis, in line with absorptive capacity, rather than&#13;
wholesale nationwide.   Its implementation  experience  shows that projects involving&#13;
decentralization, in particular, require careful consideration of administrative arrangements, roles&#13;
and responsibilities and early institutionalization. The failure to institutionalize PRODED's&#13;
INSET program does illustrates the fact that incentives such as honoraria, when excessive, are&#13;
not sustainable. Other relevant lessons include the importance of: (a) a free-standing, properly&#13;
staffed, project management unit (SEEP); (b) making better use of consultants (PRODED); and&#13;
(c) simplifying disbursement arrangements (SEEP). The Technical Volume contains details.&#13;
2.33 Lessons from Other Sources. The project design also builds on lessons learned from&#13;
other countries. Chapter 1 of the Technical Volume summarizes the findings of a 1991 review of&#13;
over 100 education reform programs worldwide9 and recent literature on the management of&#13;
educational change.  Three key lessons emphasize the importance of:  (a) schools and&#13;
classrooms, decentralized educational decision-making power, and local solutions to local&#13;

problems; (b) implementation, which must be a learning process characterized by stable goals&#13;
and coupled with flexible modalities but based on serious monitoring; and (c) participation&#13;
during planning, preparation and implementation, to increase ownership.&#13;
2.34 Findings about the management of complexity and uncertainty also deserve special&#13;
mention because the proposed project on the one hand, takes a systemic approach and departs&#13;
from standardized planning, which makes it managerially demanding; and on the other hand, will&#13;
be implemented in an environment characterized by a fairly high degree of institutional and&#13;
political unpredictability. The following design choices have been made to minimize these risks:&#13;
*  Selectivity: the project will target 26 Divisions out of 134&#13;
*  Geographic phasing: 6 pilot provinces by appraisal, 8 more in PY2 and 12 in PY3&#13;
*   Upfront deloading. (a) curriculum improvement, will be approached, not as a project&#13;
component, but through INSET and textbook revision; (b) the reform of teacher pre-&#13;
service training, rationalization of the State Universities/Colleges and of staffing norms&#13;
to achieve efficiency gains will be pursued as part of the policy dialogue&#13;
*  Piloting: pilots, funded by the SIIF beginning in PY2, will test different models of&#13;
school empowerment, school pricing, and improvement plans for marginalized schools&#13;
*  Incremental levels of innovation, as units demonstrate their ability to handle new tasks&#13;
*  Contracting out to the private sector some support functions (research, INSET...)&#13;
*  Intensive capacity-building focus in PYI.&#13;
2.35   Analysis of Design Alternatives.  During preparation, the DECS/Bank project team&#13;
looked at alternative project designs from three different perspectives (Details in Annex 2).&#13;
Technical Options. Based on existing studies, the team looked at the impact on cost and learning&#13;
of the following inputs and/or alternatives: (a) workbooks/textbooks; (b) multigrade versus&#13;
monograde teaching; (c) pre-service versus in-service teacher training; (d) early childhood/pre-&#13;
school programs; (e) nutrition and health interventions; (f) reduction in class-size; and&#13;
(g) desks/furniture. The findings helped determine the nature/ scope of project interventions.&#13;
Public/Private Provision. A recent analysis of the relationship between income levels and&#13;
enrollment distribution between public and private schools shows that, by contrast with&#13;
secondary education, public schools are the main, if not the only, elementary schooling&#13;
opportunity for poor children, especially in rural areas. This justifies the project focus on public&#13;
elementary education. Public/Private Financing. Three main pricing options to retain poor&#13;
pupils in school were examined. Charging the full cost of a better quality elementary education&#13;
was rejected. The required increase in present per pupil expenditures would drive up the cost to&#13;
parents, which is already contributing to the drop-out rate. Instead the project aims to lower the&#13;
private cost of education by providing fully-subsidized textbooks, relaxing the uniforn&#13;
requirements, and bringing schools within walking distance from home. However, for the 22&#13;
percent who are fully employed, it may be necessary to lower the price even further by&#13;
subsidizing the cost of school attendance. The study on child labor will determine the level of&#13;
subsidy required to keep children at different income levels in school, leading to a pilot voucher&#13;
system (para. 3.39).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

F. RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.36  The project is an important building-block of the Bank's CAS, discussed by the&#13;
Executive Directors in April, 1996, which aims to help GoP transform the present growth into&#13;
sustainable, broad-based development and to accelerate poverty reduction. It is a direct follow-&#13;
up to the Bank's recent Strategy to Fight Poverty (Report No. 14933-PH), and would&#13;
operationalize several of its key priorities: the provision of quality basic social services for the&#13;
poor; recognition that education remains a central government function and the main intervention&#13;
to help the next generation pull themselves out of poverty; and targeting. By focusing on the&#13;
design and testing of a framework for redressing inequities, on the development of more effective&#13;
and efficient delivery mechanisms, and on donor concessional finance and technical&#13;
mobilization, the project would have the type of strategic and multiplier impact the GoP expects&#13;
from Bank operations in the social sectors. Increasing investment in elementary education is a&#13;
major determinant of predicted economic growth rates, accounting for 34 percent of the&#13;
differential between Latin America and East Asia. Raising the level of educational attainment to&#13;
high school completion, towards which the project would be a first step, would reduce the&#13;
poverty headcount by over 1 1 percentage points and the poverty gap by almost 6 percentage&#13;
points. The current economic take-off is absorbing the excess underemployed educated labor.&#13;
This may take a few years. Because investments in human capital have a long gestation period,&#13;
now is the time to initiate the reforms needed to ensure that by 2015, the country has a large&#13;
enough pool of workers who are sufficiently literate and numerate to be adaptable and trainable.&#13;
2.37 Macro Policies and Implementation. As recommended in the Bank's 1995 Public&#13;
Expenditure Review, the project will also help rationalize public expenditures by improving&#13;
resource allocation through targeting and better budget monitoring. It will build the professional&#13;
and managerial capacities needed for DECS to adapt to its changing role, facilitating&#13;
implementation of the civil service reform. It will use the lessons from other sectors, especially&#13;
health, to ease the process of educational decentralization. The likelihood that it will achieve&#13;
results is enhanced by the level of attention given to institutionalization during preparation.&#13;
2.38  The Bank's non-financial contribution to the project is threefold. During preparation, it&#13;
brought its cross-country experience (notably Chile, Columbia, and India) to bear into project&#13;
design, especially in the areas of participatory planning, school improvement, educational&#13;
decentralization and the management of change. The Bank also assembled a coalition of donors&#13;
who support the project, either as cofinancier (Japan's OECF) or through a reorientation of their&#13;
programs. AusAID and possibly HEDCO (Australian and Irish Government Bilateral Agencies)&#13;
will strengthen the Teacher Education Institutions that will supply in-service training; CIDA is&#13;
assisting the process of educational decentralization and textbook privatization; UNDP/UNICEF&#13;
is deepening and expanding its involvement in multigrade teaching. During implementation, the&#13;
Bank and these donors will help ensure that this evolving, participatory project receives the right&#13;
level and type of supervision -- frequent, supportive, flexible and result-oriented. The thrust of&#13;
donor interventions is summarized in Annex 3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. GOALS, OBJECTIVES, AND INDICATORS&#13;
3.1   GoP's constitutional goals for education are to maximize its contribution to national&#13;
development and to equalize access to, and the benefits from, it. Closing the educational gap&#13;
between rich and poor provinces in terms of school inputs and outcomes has top policy priority&#13;
under the Social Reform Agenda. Another concern of the Department of Education, Culture and&#13;
Sports (DECS) is to modernize education. The proposed Third Elementary Education Project -&#13;
or TEEP - addresses the first goal, and to a lesser extent, supports the second one. TEEP is a&#13;
specific investment project which aims to: (a) build the institutional capacity of DECS to&#13;
manage the change process associated with TEEP; and (b) improve learning achievements,&#13;
completion rates and access to quality elementary education in 26 poor provinces, especially&#13;
their most disadvantaged communities. The targeted areas include the 20 SRA, plus six&#13;
provinces identified by the Presidential Commission to Fight Poverty as including a substantial&#13;
number of the very poor; 60 percent of the population in the targeted provinces are classified as&#13;
poor. Together the 26 provinces account for 18 percent of the nation's population, 20 percent of&#13;
the 6-12 year olds and 24 percent of the poor. Poverty there is both more severe and "deeper"&#13;
than the national average. Details are in Annex 4.&#13;
3.2   Eleven performance indicators and targets linked to these objectives have been agreed&#13;
with the stakeholders. They complement the traditional measures of performance covered by&#13;
routine reporting -procurement, disbursement, etc. For capacity-building, implementors will&#13;
monitor: (a) the extent to which policy decisions reflect project-funded research (Outcome - this&#13;
is one of two non-quantifiable indicators); (b) the timeliness and accuracy of statistical reports&#13;
(Output); (c) the gap between planned and actual sub-sectoral expenditures achievements&#13;
(Outcome); (d) institutionalization of in-service training (Impact); (e) the level of resources&#13;
flowing directly to schools (Input); and (f) the extent to which Central/Local Government cost-&#13;
sharing operates as a targeting mechanism (Impact). For educational improvement in 26 poor&#13;
provinces, monitoring will cover: (g) the textbook:pupil ratio in remote schools (Outcome);&#13;
(h) pupils' scores in English, Mathematics and Science (Impact); (i) completion rates through&#13;
Grade VI (Impact); (j) the percentage of children living less than one hour's walk from school&#13;
(Outcome); and (k) the extent to which stakeholders, especially minority groups, feel that they&#13;
have been consulted during preparation, and that their views are taken into account during&#13;
implementation (Outcome). Annex 5 details the targets and monitoring arrangements.&#13;
B. SCOPE AND APPROACH&#13;
3.3  Implementation will be phased. During preparation, six School Divisions (Provinces)&#13;
selected as pilots formulated their own 5-year Divisional Elementary Education Development&#13;
Plans (DEDPs), following agreed TEEP Guidelines. This allowed DECS to develop, by major&#13;
geographic zone, a typology of issues and solutions which were extrapolated for costing. This is&#13;
a process project characterized by a flexible design under which detailed planning of&#13;
interventions will be done by the stakeholders during implementation, allowing adjustments in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
an uncertain environment. The six pilot DEDPs were appraised by the Bank/OECF in May&#13;
1996. Two more batches of 8 and 12 DEDPs will be prepared/appraised in the second and third&#13;
project years (PY2 and 3) respectively. By the end of its seven year period, TEEP will have&#13;
benefited about 2.3 million 6-12 year olds, about 70 percent of whom come from poor&#13;
households, and nearly 52,000 teachers and education managers. The completion rate in the&#13;
target group is expected to increase from an average of 55 percent to 64 - 71 percent (low/high&#13;
case scenario), and learning achievements to increase by 20 percent. Designed as an exceptional&#13;
intervention to overcome the educational odds of isolated, long neglected rural areas, TEEP cuts&#13;
across bureaucratic layers and processes. If the effectiveness of the approach -which combines&#13;
targeting, a school focus, decentralization, participation and information-based decision-making-&#13;
is confirmed, the GoP plans to extend it nationwide.&#13;
3.4   Preparation was driven by the stakeholders, earning TEEP the status of Participation&#13;
Flagship in the Bank. It started with participatory Sector Work, most of which was conducted by&#13;
Filipino consultants and Task Forces during 1994-95.  The Sector Work focused on&#13;
implementation, since educational strategic directions had already been mapped out by the&#13;
EDCOM Report, and was designed to build consensus. About ten input studies were conducted,&#13;
and numerous consultations were organized nationwide to create ownership. Following project&#13;
identification in February 1995, a bottom-up planning approach was adopted under which each&#13;
DECS Divisional Team in six pilot provinces prepared its own DEDP with local technical&#13;
assistance and the participation of LGUs, Universities, Parent-Teacher Associations (PTAs), and&#13;
Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). The process involved a variety of steps and&#13;
participatory techniques, from baseline data collection to pilot preparation activities. Special&#13;
care was taken to ensure culturally appropriate ways of consulting minority groups during&#13;
preparation. For the Divisional teams, Bank missions provided capacity-building opportunities&#13;
in unfamiliar planning and budgeting techniques. In turn, the six pilot provinces will help the&#13;
next batches of provinces, initiating a leaming process. The LGUs support TEEP and are ready&#13;
to contribute to its funding and implementation. Annex 6 and the Technical Volume (TV) give&#13;
details.&#13;
C. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.5   To achieve its objectives, the project will have a policy and institutional framework and&#13;
two investment components.&#13;
3.6   Policy and Institutional Framework (PIFM. The PIF will: (a) improve the adequacy,&#13;
efficiency, and equity of sub-sectoral funding by protecting the elementary education budget;&#13;
targeting resources to reduce the cost of schooling for poor children; devolving the School&#13;
Building Program (SBP), the cost of which will be shared between the Central and Local&#13;
Governments; and rationalizing staff deployment; (b) ensure that basic inputs are delivered to&#13;
project schools through community involvement and more transparent operations, and improve&#13;
school and classroom processes; (c) introduce systems and procedures to decentralize selected&#13;
education functions and the corresponding resources, to the Divisions and, where feasible, the&#13;
schools; (d) measure the impact of project interventions on cost and learning to guide decision-&#13;
making; and (e) provide a Framework for the orderly handling of Resettlement issues that may be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
raised by the SBP. A Memorandum of Policy, prepared by DECS and formally endorsed by the&#13;
Cabinet, outlines these directions (Annex 7).  Because the underlying implementation&#13;
arrangements require a number of exceptions to existing rules, they have been fonnalized in&#13;
Memoranda of Agreement (MoAs) between DECS, the Department of Finance (DoF), the&#13;
Department of Budget Management (DBM), and the Department of Public Works and Highways&#13;
(DPWH). Detailed TEEP Guidelines, designed to guide field practitioners in the day-to-day&#13;
implementation of the project, have been prepared. During negotiations, assurances were&#13;
obtained from GoP that it shall (i) carry out the Project in accordance with the principles set&#13;
forth in the Memorandum of Policy and with the TEEP Guidelines; (ii) exchange views with the&#13;
Bank prior to any modification to its Memorandum of Policy or to any of the MoAs with DoF,&#13;
DBM, and DPWH, that would materially and negatively affect the carrying out of the project,&#13;
and (iii) not amend, suspend, abrogate, repeal or waive the TEEP Guidelines without the prior&#13;
approval of the Bank As a Condition of Loan Effectiveness, the MoA with DoF, DBM, and&#13;
DPWH shall have become effective. As a Condition of Disbursement against the DEDPs, [the&#13;
final] TEEP Guidelines, acceptable to the Bank, shall have been adopted and put into effect by&#13;
DECS. One exception to this Disbursement Condition is "Instructional Materials", which require&#13;
immediate procurement action.&#13;
3.7  Investrnent Components.&#13;
(a)   Capacity-building at the National and Regional Levels. This component will:&#13;
(i) create a national structure for project management and capacity-strengthening;&#13;
(ii) build capacities in support of policy and decision-making; and (iii) build&#13;
capacities in support of decentralized implementation and effective schools&#13;
(estimated baseline cost, US$28.0 million or 6 percent of total base cost); and&#13;
(b)   Educational Improvement in 26 poor provinces.   This component will:&#13;
(i) strengthen capacities in the Divisional Offices, LGUs and other TEEP&#13;
stakeholders of the targeted provinces; (ii) develop and implement, on a phased&#13;
basis,  locally-prepared,  customized  Divisional  Elementary  Education&#13;
Development Plans (DEDPs) in the 26 provinces. With local variations, the Plans&#13;
are expected to: (i) improve learning through: the provision of textbooks/&#13;
instructional materials, in-service training (INSET) and pedagogic renovation,&#13;
and, awards from a School Improvement and Innovation Facility (SIIF); (ii) raise&#13;
completion rates through: the construction/rehabilitation/repair and the provision&#13;
of equipment of fully equipped small multigrade village schools; community&#13;
mobilization; and demand-side interventions, mostly funded as pilots under SIIF;&#13;
(iii) expand access through: the provision of additional school places with&#13;
furniture and equipment (US$453.7 million, or 94 percent of total base cost).&#13;
3.8   The project will finance largely the same inputs as more traditional education projects.&#13;
However, the approach is different, with its bottom-up planning process, its emphasis on school&#13;
processes, systemic capacity-building and learning, and decentralization thrust.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
D. FIRST COMPONENT: CAPACITY-BUILDING AT THE CENTRAL AND&#13;
REGIONAL LEVELS (US$28.0 MILLION)&#13;
3.9   This component will establish a national management structure, with antennae in the&#13;
TEEP Divisions, to help DECS manage the project and build capacities at key levels of the&#13;
system. It will be financed by the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan, with&#13;
the exception of the MIS, which is Bank-funded. Para. 4.7 summarizes the cofinancing plan. A&#13;
Condition of Effectiveness of the IBRD Loan is that all conditions precedent to the effectiveness&#13;
of the OECF Loan Agreement shall have been fulfilled&#13;
Sub-Component One: National Management Structure (US$6.7 million)&#13;
3.10  The Basic Education Steering Committee, an existing interagency high-level body chaired&#13;
by DECS Secretary, will be responsible for overall policy direction and interagency coordination.&#13;
A Project Management Advisory Committee (PMAC) composed of DECS managers and&#13;
stakeholder representatives (parents, LGUs, and an independent Group of Eminent Educators)&#13;
has been established to (a) provide overall management advice to the Project Director; (b) make&#13;
recommendations on proposed modifications to the TEEP Guidelines; (c) provide intra-&#13;
departmental coordination; and (d) articulate stakeholder perspectives and concerns to guide&#13;
project implementation. The Project Director -- DECS Undersecretary for Programs and&#13;
Operations -- will also be assisted in an advisory capacity by the concerned Regional Directors,&#13;
DECS Assistant Secretaries, and the Director of Elementary Education.&#13;
3.11  Project Implementation Support Unit (PISU). A PISU has also been established to:&#13;
(a) support and monitor TEEP day-to-day implementation at the national level, within the "TEEP&#13;
Guidelines"; and (b) build capacity in DECS. A PISU Manager, acceptable to the Bank, has been&#13;
appointed from DECS Bureau of Elementary Education. The PISU will be fully integrated in&#13;
DECS' Operations Complex and will eventually be merged into it. It will be staffed with (i) a&#13;
core of DECS personnel, seconded there because of their experience with sector project type of&#13;
approaches, acquired both during PRODED and TEEP preparation; (ii) national consultants with&#13;
strong experience in modern project and education management techniques; and (iii) on a&#13;
rotating basis, DECS staff who will join the PISU for developmental assignments, then return to&#13;
their base unit to become agents of institutional change; some PISU functions will even be&#13;
directly located in DECS existing units, with consultant inputs where required by the use of new&#13;
techniques or approaches. The combination of regular/temporary staff and consultants should&#13;
provide continuity and ownership, sustainability yet enough flexibility to survive a possible&#13;
restructuring of DECS during implementation. Annex 8 provides the organizational chart.&#13;
3.12  The national managerial, professional and technical assistance services and related&#13;
training, equipment, and vehicles required by PISU, including the specialist services for&#13;
capacity-building in the provinces, will be procured under an umbrella-contract to be reviewed&#13;
by the Bank and OECF. The selection process will follow OECF procedures. As a Condition of&#13;
Disbursement against the DEDPs, GoP shall have appointed the following PISU's key&#13;
consultant staff: facilities specialist, procurement specialist and a TEEP Advisor in each of the&#13;
six pilot provinces, with qualifications and experience acceptable to the Bank&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19-&#13;
Sub-Component Two: Support to Policy and Decision-Making (US$9.6 million)&#13;
3.13  All the capacity-building (CB) sub-components will, with variations, begin with the&#13;
establishment of a TEEP Support Team (one each for Research/Strategic Thinking, Assessment,&#13;
MIS Statistics, Budget/Finance, Instructional Material, INSET, etc...) consisting of regular DECS&#13;
staff and one PISU consultant, and based either in the PISU or in the relevant DECS entity. Each&#13;
Support Team will (a) provide support to decentralized implementation in its particular area of&#13;
responsibility; (b) organize training for DECS staff in a new way of performing their functions&#13;
and, where appropriate (research, assessment, management training ...), manage, with assistance&#13;
from PISU's Procurement Team, a program of contracts with outside specialized agencies.&#13;
Management training will be under the overall responsibility of the National Educators Academy&#13;
of the Philippines (NEAP), operating under contracts with private consultants.&#13;
3.14. Research and Evaluation. To give DECS' management access to quality policy analysis,&#13;
TEEP will support a national Policy Research Unit, to be established outside DECS through&#13;
local competition. The Unit and other sub-contractors will carry out studies and rigorous&#13;
evaluations related to: (a) determinants of student drop-out from elementary school (20 percent);&#13;
(b) impact of project reforms on student learning and school completion (50 percent); and&#13;
(c) other topics, such as the cost and benefits of adding an 11th year to basic education, at the&#13;
request of the Secretary (20 percent). It will also disseminate the results of all research,&#13;
evaluation and assessment carried out under TEEP (10 percent). PISU will act as liaison with the&#13;
Policy Unit, identify emerging issues and commission the studies. Details are in the Borrower's&#13;
Project Implementation Plan (PIP) and the Bank's Technical Volume (TV).&#13;
3.15 Assessment. Feeding into these evaluations, the project will improve the quality of&#13;
information on student leaming achievement, following on the recommendations of a national&#13;
workshop on Assessment Systems (November 1993). This will include: (a) capacity-building in&#13;
national assessment strategies; (b) visits by national sampling consultants; (c) development and&#13;
implementation of national assessment tests; and (d) higher degree studies in assessment. TEEP&#13;
will contract a strong national institution with good international linkages to help the National&#13;
Education Testing Research Center (NETRC) to (i) develop a national sample-based assessment&#13;
system, (ii) administer tests in mathematics, science, English and/or Filipino to approximately&#13;
1,000 students per grade in Grades 2, 4, and 6; and (iii) provide teachers in TEEP provinces with&#13;
additional support in developing curriculum-based formative assessments. Details are in the&#13;
Technical Volume. Assurances were received at negotiations that GoP shall administer the&#13;
national sample-based assessment tests (i) in all active Project Provinces in 1998, 2000, and&#13;
2002; and (ii) in accordance with methods acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
3.16  MIS, Statistics and Planning. Based on a pilot educational MIS developed in three&#13;
Divisions during preparation, the which project will: (a) improve data quality by reducing the&#13;
demands placed on schools and familiarizing them with data-based monitoring; (b) train DECS-&#13;
CO, RO and DO staff in the use of this new MIS to support policy-making, scenario&#13;
development and resource targeting, participatory planning for the DEDPs, decentralization of&#13;
decision-making to the DOs, and performance monitoring for increased transparency and&#13;
accountability. The new MIS will be implemented in DECS CO, the 11 concerned Regional&#13;
Offices, the 26 TEEP Divisional Offices, 50 selected District Offices and a few selected schools.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
The MIS is the only element of the first component to be funded by the IBRD Loan. The Loan&#13;
will finance training, specialist services, and equipment.&#13;
Sub-Component Three: Support to Decentralized Implementation and Effective Schools&#13;
(US$11.7 million)&#13;
3.17  Budget and Finance.  To address the issues identified in the Bank's 1995 Public&#13;
Expenditure Review, the project will assist DECS Financial/Management and Planning Service&#13;
Units (FMS) in developing standards and procedures to (a) improve allocative effectiveness and&#13;
efficiency, especially expenditure targeting; (b) ensure that funds flow directly to TEEP&#13;
provinces and in selected cases, to schools; (c) improve budget presentation and monitoring,&#13;
beginning in FY98; (d) tighten the linkage between policies, allocations, and delivery of&#13;
education. Personnel Management. To improve the utilization and productivity of education&#13;
personnel in the TEEP provinces, under the project DECS' FMS will commission manning&#13;
studies and operational research. The results, which will guide the revision of staffing norms,&#13;
will be discussed at the joint annual reviews.&#13;
3.18  Quality Inputs. Three programs which are critical to quality improvement and the change&#13;
process underlying TEEP -- textbooks and instructional materials, in-service training, and a&#13;
School Improvement and Innovation Facility -- will be implemented at the provincial level, with&#13;
the center and regions playing a support role. They are described beginning in para. 3.23.&#13;
3.19  Advocacy. The project will: (a) inform potential stakeholders (parents, community&#13;
leaders, LGUs, DECS staff) of TEEP's objectives, approaches, and implementation modalities to&#13;
gain their active support; (b) help ensure that DECS staff at all levels understands and supports&#13;
the value of the participatory, grassroots approach to DEDP planning and of decentralized&#13;
management. Community mobilization methods will be used, in coordination with a series of&#13;
audio-visual communications and targeted media messages. Based in PISU, with support from&#13;
the Regional Offices, the Advocacy team will: (i) conduct research, formulate strategy, manage&#13;
the production work and community mobilization training; (ii) develop material in accordance&#13;
with standard communications practice including pre-testing and impact/efficiency evaluation;&#13;
and (iii) develop in DECS the expertise to manage the program. Furthermore, each concerned&#13;
Regional Office will run a TEEP "Hot-Line" and "Help Desk" to answer queries from, and&#13;
mobilize support to, project implementors. Details are in the PIP and the TV.&#13;
3.20  Preparation Facility. To support the participatory planning of the remaining 20 DEDPs,&#13;
and their start-up activities, the project will finance a Preparation Facility. DEDP Preparation&#13;
Guidelines form part of TEEP Guidelines.&#13;
E. SECOND COMPONENT: ELEMENTARY EDUCATION IMPROVEMENT IN 26&#13;
POOR PROVINCES (US$453.7 MILLION)&#13;
3.21  What are the DEDPs? The DEDPs are sub-projects prepared by divisional planning&#13;
teams following TEEP Guidelines developed by DECS-CO with World Bank assistance and with&#13;
extensive stakeholder consultations. Although the provinces are pre-targeted, approval of their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
DEDP is subject to compliance with eligibility criteria. The horizon of the DEDPs is five years,&#13;
with detailed Annual Work Plans and Budgets, all to be approved by the TEEP Director on the&#13;
recommendation of PISU. Provinces that do not deliver on their contractual commitments will&#13;
be suspended after two years, and others, substituted for them. Despite local variations, a core of&#13;
interventions has emerged from the six pilot DEDPs (para. 3.3). To ensure high-quality start-up&#13;
and create the conditions for institutionalization, emphasis is being placed on upfront&#13;
development of capacities, systems and procedures. The focus is on the creation of more&#13;
"Effective Schools" in poor rural areas, and the entire system is being reorganized to support that&#13;
approach. Implementation will be the responsibility of the DOs. Annex 9 summarizes the key&#13;
elements of TEEP Guidelines governing DEDP preparation. The DEDPs for the six pilot&#13;
provinces are in the TV. At negotiations, GoP gave assurances that each DEDP shall be&#13;
prepared and appraised in consultation with the Bank. As a Condition of Disbursement against&#13;
the DEDPs, GoP shall, in respect of the DEDPs for each of the six pilot provinces, cause the&#13;
respective DECS- DO to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement satisfactory to the Bank with&#13;
the respective provincial and municipal LGUs, parent representatives, and other concerned&#13;
parties which shall set forth the obligations of each party to implement such DEDP in&#13;
accordance with the TEEP Guidelines.&#13;
3.22 This component will: (a) strengthen the capacity of (i) DECS Divisional Offices (DO) as&#13;
the basic TEEP provincial management structure; (ii) the LGUs, Parents-Teachers Associations&#13;
(PTAs), Teacher Education Institutes (TEIs), Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), and&#13;
communities, so that they actively support TEEP; and (c) develop and implement the DEDPs.&#13;
Sub-Component One: Divisional/Provincial Management Structure and Capacity-Building&#13;
(US$32.5 million)&#13;
3.23  Divisional Offices. Until now mere administrators and implementors, the Division&#13;
Superintendents are becoming managers. In partnership with other stakeholders, they will&#13;
(a) oversee the preparation of the DEDPs; (b) cooperate with the Provincial School Boards to&#13;
mobilize more resources from the SEF and secure endorsement of the DEDPs; (c) implement the&#13;
DEDPs; and (d) use the School Boards as "democratic oversight mechanisms". The Regional&#13;
Offices' role will evolve towards support/mentoring and monitoring. Other partners of the DOs&#13;
will be: the Municipalities and their Engineering Offices, who will implement the school&#13;
building program (SBP); TEIs and other consultants for training; NGOs as service providers, and&#13;
the private sector, as a potential source of additional funding.&#13;
3.24 Each Divisional Superintendent will be assisted by one TEEP Adviser plus three&#13;
months/year of other short-term technical specialist services on demand. The Advisers will not&#13;
substitute for the DO staff, who will remain in charge, but will provide on-the-job training,&#13;
analyses and recommendations for action. The duration (3 years on average) and nature of this&#13;
assistance may vary depending on the pace at which existing DO staff acquire the new skills&#13;
required for implementing TEEP. Benchmarks will help the DOs monitor their performance.&#13;
3.25 GoP and donor funds will flow directly to the DOs via DECS, and the DOs are being&#13;
reinforced by GoP to handle their new financial responsibilities, described in para. 4.36. The new&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
MIS, designed to help the Divisions in making school-mapping and other allocative decisions,&#13;
and in monitoring TEEP, will be installed in the DOs. Working closely with DECS-CO's&#13;
various Support Teams, the new DOs will outcontract support services such as INSET or local&#13;
adaptation of materials. The specialist services to provide technical support and training will be&#13;
financed by OECF under the PISU umbrella -contract, with the Bank Loan financing civil works&#13;
and equipment for the DOs. Annex 10 and the TV provide details on decentralization.&#13;
3.26  Non-DECS Stakeholders.  To mobilize support for TEEP and institutionalize its&#13;
participatory approaches, this group will receive induction and training in areas such as TEEP's&#13;
principles and design, communications, and management. The stakeholders include the LGUs,&#13;
which will share in the cost of the school building program, and, through their Engineering&#13;
Offices, will participate in its implementation; PTAs, which will play an increased role as schools&#13;
are "empowered" and elect a School Management Advisory Committee; NGOs, which will be&#13;
involved in the advocacy campaign, training, school construction, some of the pilots, and the&#13;
yearly participatory performance audit. The Loan will finance workshops and materials.&#13;
3.27 School Improvement and Innovation Facility (SIIFP. The SIIF is a tool for pedagogic&#13;
decentralization and for targeting, with two windows. At the National level, it will pilot-test&#13;
alternative new approaches to issues of national relevance. This window will be managed by&#13;
PISU, in liaison with DECS Units. At the Divisional level, SIIF will target resources at&#13;
"marginalized" schools to engage them in diagnosing their problems and in defining and&#13;
implementing their own improvement plans. All schools (and clusters) will be classified in one&#13;
of three risk categories based on agreed criteria and will compete on the basis of two-year school&#13;
improvement plans (SIPs) emphasizing school-based quality enhancement. About 1,700 grants,&#13;
ranging between US$ 1,000 - US$3,000 equivalent, will be awarded.&#13;
3.28  The District and Division Supervisors will be trained respectively, to support preparation&#13;
of the proposals, and to review them. Two thirds of the grants will be for clusters, so that about&#13;
4,000 schools (out of 9,500) could benefit. The SIIF proposals will be subject to rigorous&#13;
monitoring by the DOs, and spot-checks by PISU. NGOs may be involved in an implementing&#13;
or monitoring capacity. The advocacy campaign will disseminate success stories, and there will&#13;
be a vearly stock-taking exercise. SIIF Guidelines, which are part of the TEEP Guidelines, have&#13;
been finalized and will be tested during PYI, and deployed by PY2. Annex 11 and the TV&#13;
provide details, including eligibility criteria. The Bank Loan will fund the demand-side&#13;
interventions (paras. 3.38-3.39), and OECF, the remainder of SIIF activities.&#13;
3.29  Below are examples of SIIF proposals, which are detailed in Annex 11, Table 11.1:&#13;
*  School Empowerment to encourage schools and their communities to diagnose their&#13;
problems and define their own strategies.&#13;
*  School Improvement Plans, including experiments such as a more flexible approach&#13;
to school attendance, environmental measurement, exchanges between schools, etc.&#13;
*  Indigenization of Material and Curriculum and training of indigenous teachers to&#13;
assist with the transition from the vernacular to the languages of instruction, and to&#13;
promote culturally appropriate minority education (Annex 11, Part Two).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
* Community-based, Early Childhood Development Pilots to test different&#13;
organizational models (e.g. center vs. home-based).&#13;
. Addressing the needs of children in especially difficult circumstances (due to&#13;
exploitation, disabilities, etc...).&#13;
. Special, demand-side programs including school health and nutrition, modular&#13;
programs for migrant and nomadic children, etc.&#13;
* Vouchers to retain poor children in school (para. 3.39).&#13;
Sub-Component Two: Divisional Elementary Education Development plans&#13;
(US$421.2 million)&#13;
Improving Learning Achievements&#13;
3.30  Quality improvements are the best strategy to make school more interesting and retain&#13;
children. They can also generate savings through a more efficient flow of pupils. The project&#13;
will: (a) ensure the availability of textbooks and instructional materials in remote schools;&#13;
(b) revitalize in-service training (INSET) and refocus it on schools and pupil achievements; and&#13;
(c) use SIIF to support school-based experiments.&#13;
3.31  Textbooks and Instructional Materials. TEEP will: (a) ensure that every teacher and&#13;
every other pupil in the 26 provinces gets a basic set of quality books and instructional materials&#13;
at the beginning of the school year and knows how to use them; (b) support the policy and&#13;
institutional measures required to ensure an orderly transition to a fully private publishing sector.&#13;
An Instructional Materials Support Team will be trained in DECS-CO with assistance from&#13;
PISU. Until June 1998, textbooks will be reprints of books developed by the Instructional&#13;
Materials Development Center (IMDC), procured following Bank procedures. By SY98-99,&#13;
textbooks will have been published by the private sector based on DECS specifications and&#13;
approved by a team of DECS evaluators. Procurement will follow GoP procedures, under which&#13;
schools will choose from approved DECS lists. DECS is receiving technical assistance from the&#13;
Asian Development Bank to develop a full textbook distribution system.&#13;
3.32   For all of the 26 provinces, TEEP will provide since PYl one set (= 4) of textbooks for&#13;
two pupils. Although less than presently prescribed by DECS, this is considered adequate, is&#13;
more sustainable, and will promote prioritization on core disciplines. To contain costs and&#13;
promote individual learning, the Grade I - III books will be in an abridged, modular form. In&#13;
multigrade schools each classroom will each receive a science corner and a reading corner to&#13;
facilitate independent or small group work, and for each pupil, a set (= 3) of learning guides and&#13;
workbooks. Each one of the project's classroom and 9,500 schools will receive a kit of&#13;
instructional material. Monograde schools will be equipped with a supplementary library (two&#13;
copies of 200 books each). Teachers, principals and supervisors will be trained, for the short-&#13;
term, in a more creative use of textbooks and other reading material, and for the medium-term,&#13;
when schools have choice, in the selection of textbooks. The Loan will finance paper and a&#13;
reprint of the above materials in all 26 provinces in PY1, and school/classroom kits of&#13;
instructional materials. For the remaining PYs, the textbooks will be GoP-funded. Assurances&#13;
were received at negotiations that GoP shall, by March 31, 1997, prepare, in consultation with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
the Bank, a textbook distribution plan with the goal ofproviding a set of two textbooks per pupil&#13;
in allpublic elementary schools including in the most remote areas and implement it thereafter.&#13;
3.33 INSET for Teachers, Principals and Supervisors. To create more adaptive, effective&#13;
schools that produce independent, critical thinkers, the project will revitalize INSET in the 26&#13;
provinces. School and cluster-based, the new INSET will develop teachers into learning&#13;
facilitators capable of responding to pupils' diverse needs, and principals/supervisors into&#13;
proactive team-leaders. Thus, it will emphasize pedagogy along with subject matter. Some&#13;
50,000 teachers and 2,000 administrators, i.e., all staff, will participate. Divisions will become&#13;
codesigners and "clients", instead of mere participants in INSET. The INSET program was&#13;
designed to support a pedagogical reform characterized by: (a) a heightened role for district&#13;
supervisors in providing instructional leadership to remote rural schools; (b) the clustering of&#13;
schools; (c) school-based management, with various degrees of fiscal and pedagogical autonomy&#13;
given to schools, their principals, school-management advisory committees and communities.&#13;
The TV provides a detailed plan for implementing the reform.&#13;
3.34  The INSET program, which will rely on a four-tiered referral system and an horizontal&#13;
resource network system, involves three distinct phases. PYI will be a phase of planning and&#13;
capacity-building. Support teams consisting of three to four people at the national level, and&#13;
three to four for each Region/Division will be formed and trained for three to four weeks by&#13;
national and international consultants. Divisional mobile teams of four trainers for 30 teachers&#13;
will be trained by the support team with assistance of consultants such as TEIs. Overtime, the&#13;
plan is to increasingly outsource INSET. Beginning in PY2, the mobile teams will deliver the&#13;
training to schools and clusters, at the rate of five days p.a. This five-days on-site training will&#13;
be complemented by five days residential training p.a., normally at the district level, clinic-style.&#13;
In parallel, school and cluster-based "Learning Action Cells" (or LACs) will begin meeting once&#13;
a month, operating as professional networks. Formative team evaluation and feedback will be&#13;
built-in, and a full impact evaluation, scheduled for the mid-term review (2000). The third phase&#13;
will integrate distance education into the face-to-face program, to accelerate coverage and&#13;
improve sustainability. It will begin with a one-year research-action phase, initially limited to&#13;
two carefully selected districts per province. The pace and modalities of expansion will be&#13;
reviewed annually. The TV contains the full INSET and distance education programs.&#13;
3.35 The Loan will finance workshops, equipment, training materials, especially TEEP&#13;
Training Guidelines, vouchers for the DOs to purchase training services, 10 days per annum, for&#13;
a cumulative total of 52,000 teachers, supervisors and principals; (b) provision of simple&#13;
technologies in the 500 district-level lead schools (VCRs, cassettes on good teaching practice).&#13;
No honoraria will be paid, but trainees will earn credits towards promotions.&#13;
3.36   SIIF Activities. School Empowerment, School Improvements Plans, Curriculum and&#13;
Materials Indigenization, and Early Childhood Development programs are effective strategies to&#13;
improve learning (paras. 3.27 and 3.29). All will be piloted under the SIIF (Annex 11).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
Raising Completion Rates&#13;
3.37  Table 2.2 suggests that a full drop-out reduction strategy must also (a) support special&#13;
programs and demand-side interventions to address the issues of health, high cost of public&#13;
schooling, and need for children to work; (b) mobilize communities; and (c) bring a complete,&#13;
better equipped elementary school closer to the "barangay" (village).&#13;
3.38  Demand-Side Interventions. To address the demand-side issues identified in the DEDPs,&#13;
the project will pilot special programs and fund them under SIIF because many of them, while&#13;
critical, are not mainstream to public education. GoP has committed up to five percent of total&#13;
DEDP base costs to these activities. The adoption and eventual expansion of pilot programs will&#13;
be conditional upon demonstrated LGU financial commitment and compliance with national&#13;
policies. As part of the participatory planning process, indigenous people will be encouraged to&#13;
voice their felt needs for culturally sensitive educational programs.&#13;
3.39 A priority intervention under this heading is demand-side financing. While TEEP's&#13;
quantity and quality improvements will make education more attractive, this pilot will make it&#13;
more affordable to the poor by offsetting direct and indirect private costs. The objective will be&#13;
to determine: (a) within a randomized, experimental setting, the relative effectiveness and the&#13;
feasibility of generalizing different demand-side interventions; and (b) the subsidy level that&#13;
would prove sufficient to induce enrollment without distorting other economic decisions. Based&#13;
on models from Latin America and Asia, the pilot will experiment with (i) small scholarships to&#13;
cover direct and indirect schooling costs; (ii) vouchers in lieu of tuition at any local school&#13;
(DECS approach for secondary education); and (iii) community vouchers to build and equip&#13;
schools where none exist. The impact on retention will be discussed at the joint annual reviews.&#13;
The Bank Loan will provide SIIF grants as seed money to develop, and mainstream if justified,&#13;
demand-side pilot interventions. Assurances were received at negotiations that GoP shall, (a) by&#13;
September 30, 1997, prepare and furnish to the Bank for its review and comment, a proposed&#13;
strategy to address demand-side issues; (b) follow the criteria and procedures set forth in the&#13;
TEEP Guidelines for the informed participation of, and consultation with, a variety of&#13;
representative communities, in particular communities with indigenous peoples and ethnic&#13;
minorities, to ensure that the design and implementation thereafter of the DEDPs adequately&#13;
addresses the needs and cultural preferences of such communities.&#13;
3.40  Community Mobilization. The induction and training offered to provincial level&#13;
stakeholders (para. 3.26) will also be available to Municipal LGUs, School Management&#13;
Advisory Committees (elected from PTAs) and communities. Topics will include techniques to&#13;
ensure the sound operation of these bodies and partnerships.&#13;
3.41  Providing Complete Village Rural Schools and Improving the Physical Environment&#13;
These two interventions fall under the School Building Program, discussed below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
Expanding Access to Quality Elementary Education&#13;
3.42  School Construction and Equipment. The project will: (a) reduce the drop-outs caused&#13;
by distance from a complete school; (b) restore a classroom physical environment that is safe and&#13;
conducive to learning; and (c) expand access to reasonable quality education in poor rural areas.&#13;
3.43  Under (a), TEEP will provide all 6-12 year olds in the 26 provinces access to a complete&#13;
school less than one hour walk from home. This means promoting small multigrade schools as a&#13;
viable alternative. GoP is introducing hardship allowances for teachers and TEEP will fund cost-&#13;
effective packages of inputs designed to equalize quality between multi and monograde schools.&#13;
DECS has started developing for each province, in cooperation with UNICEF, two&#13;
demonstration multigrade clusters, adapted from Colombia's successful "Escuela Nueva" model.&#13;
The program will be based on the participatory school mapping exercise initiated during&#13;
preparation. The exact numbers, to be determined during implementation, fall under the total in&#13;
(c). Under (b) TEEP will, based on a province-by-province inventory of facilities, finance&#13;
repairs and rehabilitation of about 23,700 classrooms, the construction of toilets in 1,900 schools;&#13;
desks and furniture. To break the isolation of some of the more remote schools (25 km away&#13;
from the nearest District), it will test, where technically feasible, simple communication devices&#13;
such as cellular phones and one-way radios (two districts/province). The LGUs will provide&#13;
water or electricity connections. Under (c), TEEP will build about 6,300 new classrooms and&#13;
replace about 2,850 existing ones, using an index-based approach which combines real needs,&#13;
effectiveness, and the creation of economic opportunities through community construction. The&#13;
school mapping and community mobilization exercise will be repeated for each new TEEP&#13;
province. It will promote small multigrade, complete schools (3 classrooms, 6 grades) with a&#13;
catchment below one hour's walk, rather than large schools with a wider catchment. Moving&#13;
away from standardized models poorly adapted to local conditions, six school prototypes have&#13;
been developed -- for mono and multigrade classes, with variants for different terrains and&#13;
climatic conditions. The new norms are cost-conscious but integrate new pedagogical standards,&#13;
such as larger classrooms for multigrade and teacher quarters. The costing also reflects the&#13;
distances over which materials have to be carried.&#13;
3.44 Implementation will be delegated to the Municipalities through their Engineering&#13;
Departments, as this is likely to raise construction quality through more frequent supervision.&#13;
Details are in Annex 12 and the Technical Volume. For the GoP, this will ease the transition&#13;
towards devolution of school construction and maintenance, planned to be introduced in 1997,&#13;
and heighten Municipalities' commitment to the financing, management, and delivery of quality&#13;
elementary education. For the LGUs, it will improve the coherence of basic social services&#13;
delivery, promote synergy between the activities of the various municipal boards (education,&#13;
health), and, in the case of isolated barangays, create employment through the use of community&#13;
construction ("pakyaw"). Each DEDP will specify the scope of the civil works program, the&#13;
titling situation, the method of construction selected. The GoP has approved and adopted a&#13;
Framework for Resettlement which establishes principles and procedures. At negotiations,&#13;
assurances were obtained from GoP that it shall apply the Framework for Resettlement for&#13;
purposes of providing compensation, resettlement and rehabilitation measures to persons&#13;
affected by land acquisition. The Loan will finance civil works contracts, materials and&#13;
furniture.&#13;

A. COST ESTIMATES&#13;
4.1     Summar of Costs. Total project cost, including duties and taxes, is estimated at about&#13;
Pesos 16.9 billion, or US$569.4 million equivalent. The net of tax cost would be US$518.6&#13;
million. Investment costs are 87 percent and incremental recurrent costs, 13 percent of total&#13;
baseline costs. The cost breakdown by component and categories of expenditures is given in&#13;

4.2     Basis for Cost Estimates. Estimated costs for civil works are based on current unit costs&#13;
for construction which vary from US$180 (for classrooms) to US$250 (for Divisional Offices)&#13;
per square meter of gross floor area of construction. These costs are reasonable compared to&#13;
similar Bank-assisted construction in the Philippines. Costs of professional services also reflect&#13;
the fee scale established for similar services provided by local consulting firms. The cost&#13;
estimates for equipment, vehicles and educational materials are based on lists prepared by the&#13;
GoP. Furniture and consumable material costs are based on GoP estimates and reflect current&#13;
prices. The cost of teacher/pupil manuals are based on DECS experience with regard to those to&#13;
be reprinted, and on current publishing market prices with regard to those to be published;&#13;
Estimated salaries of additional staff are based on basic pay scales including standard&#13;
allowances.&#13;
4.3     Duties and Taxes. All imported goods are to customs duties and taxes. The total amount,&#13;
includes import duties and taxes, is estimated at about US$50.8 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
4.4     Contingency Allowances. Project costs include physical contingencies (US$45.3 million)&#13;
at 10 percent of all physical components, operation costs and maintenance, and at five percent for&#13;
technical assistance and salaries. They also include price contingencies (US$42.4 million) based&#13;
on the standard regional and Bank-wide guidelines on inflation factors.&#13;

4.5     Foreign  Exchange  Component.   This component--US$121.2  million--was estimated&#13;
based  on  the  following  foreign  exchange  proportions:    (a)  civil works:    10  percent;&#13;
(b) equipment: 90 percent; (c) instructional materials: 35 percent; (d) international consultants:&#13;
100 percent; (e) consumables, operation and maintenance costs: 5 percent. Annex 14 shows&#13;
additional cost tables.&#13;
B.  FINANCING PLAN&#13;
4.6     The estimated project cost will be financed as follows:&#13;
(a)     The  GoP  will finance  US$307.4  million  (54  percent of total project costs&#13;
including taxes and duties), and the LGUs, US$43.9 million equivalent&#13;
(7.7 percent of total project cost);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
(b)    The proposed IBRD Loan of US$113.4 million will finance 21.9 percent of total&#13;
project costs net of taxes and duties; it will be made to the Republic of the&#13;
Philippines which will make the funds available to DECS and the LGUs to&#13;
implement the project. The level of local cost financing by IBRD (17.5 percent)&#13;
is deemed appropriate; and&#13;
(c)    The OECF soft Loan of US$104.8 million equivalent will finance 20.2 percent of&#13;
total project costs net of taxes and duties.&#13;
Retroactive financing of up to US$3.0 million is proposed for eligible expenditures incurred after&#13;
July 1, 1996 under all disbursement categories except SIIF grants (category 5).&#13;
4.7    The financing plan by disbursement category is summarized in Table 4.3.&#13;

4.8    Since the LGUs' Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) will increase from  35 to 40 percent&#13;
of Internal Revenue Collections in 1997, the GoP proposes, in line with the provisions of the&#13;
LGC, to introduce through TEEP a cost-sharing between the Central and the Local Governments&#13;
for the School Building Program (SBP). This will (a) facilitate the transition towards the SBP's&#13;
full devolution; (b) allow GoP to target resources at poor LGUs, while expanding the resource&#13;
base by tapping the affluent LGUs. TEEP is the incentive for the 26 provinces to agree to the&#13;
cost-sharing. For the rest of the country, the incentive is that it will accelerate devolution of the&#13;
SBP. For TEEP purposes, the LGU share was estimated at 25 percent of total SBP cost on&#13;
average, with a range of 10-30 percent&#13;
C. PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.9    Procurement of all goods, works, SLIF grants and services funded under the Bank Loan&#13;
will be carried out in accordance with Bank procurement guidelines ("Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" of January 1995 revised in January and&#13;
August 1996, and "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the&#13;
World Bank as Executing Agency" of August 1981). Procurement of consultants, equipment,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
training, SIIF and civil works funded in parallel by OECF will be carried under procedures&#13;
satisfactory to OECF. The procurement arrangements are shown in Table 4.4.&#13;
4.10  Civil works, equipment, vehicles, furniture, and educational materials will be bulked to&#13;
the extent possible and procured as follows:&#13;
(a)   individual contracts for the purchase of goods estimated to exceed US$250,000&#13;
equivalent, will be procured by International Competitive Bidding (ICB) using the&#13;
Bank's Standard Bidding Document (January 1995). Under ICB, domestic&#13;
manufactures would be eligible for a margin of preference in bids evaluation of 15&#13;
percent of the c.i.f. costs of the competing imports or the applicable customs duty,&#13;
whichever is lower. No civil works contracts are expected to be procured under&#13;
ICB;&#13;
(b)  individual civil works contract estimated to cost between US$500,000 equivalent&#13;
and US$50,000 equivalent and individual contracts for the purchase of goods with&#13;
an estimated value between US$250,000 and US$50,000 equivalent will be&#13;
procured under National Competitive Bidding (NCB) using procedures acceptable&#13;
to the Bank;&#13;
(c)   individual civil works contracts estimated to cost less than US$50,000 equivalent,&#13;
will be procured through simplified procurement procedures similar to national&#13;
shopping applying government procedures by comparing at least three price&#13;
quotations to be obtained through local advertising from small contractors within&#13;
the locality;&#13;
(d)  individual contracts for construction materials, in packages of less than&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent, will be procured through simplified national shopping&#13;
applying government procedures by comparing at least three price quotations to&#13;
be obtained through local advertising from small contractors within the locality;&#13;
(e)   works and goods (including 50 percent of school furniture) required for the SBP&#13;
will be directly contracted with community groups to increase sustainability&#13;
through community labor;&#13;
(f)   labor for small scale works in remote schools can be carried out by Municipalities&#13;
through Force Account e.g., using their own personnel and equipment, if no&#13;
contractor is interested in performing the works at a reasonable cost and no&#13;
community is interested in and/or capable of, performing the work.&#13;
4.11  Procurement Management. A Procurement Team to be established in the PISU at DECS-&#13;
CO will be directly responsible for ICB and will oversee/provide support to the 26 DOs, who&#13;
will handle all other procedures. Procurement will be handled by the Prequalification Bids and&#13;
Awards Commission (PBAC) which by law is mandated to oversee the bidding process. For&#13;
ICB, to be handled by DECS-CO, the PBAC is chaired by one Under or Assistant Secretary and&#13;
includes technical staff and a lawyer. For the DOs, procurement will be handled by DECS-DO&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
PBAC, with technical assistance from the Provincial Engineers/DPWH, and a legal counsel.&#13;
Procurement of school construction and repairs will be handled by the Municipalities, with&#13;
DECS-DO monitoring. Except for community works which will be contracted directly,&#13;
Municipalities will procure works and construction materials through the Municipal PBAC in&#13;
which representatives of the concerned communities/schools will participate.  Annex 12&#13;
describes the civil-works management arrangements.  Technical oversight/support will be&#13;
provided at DECS-CO and DO levels until pre-agreed benchmarks of performance are met.&#13;
4.12  Civil Works. (a) The construction of 14 DOs, with an aggregate amount of US$3.1&#13;
million, and an estimated unit cost per site of about US$240,000 for the new office buildings,&#13;
will be carried out through NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. Due to the phased&#13;
implementation and the wide dispersion of sites, works cannot be aggregated under large&#13;
contracts and will not be attractive to foreign contractors. Procurement will be managed by the&#13;
respective DECS-DO PBACs with technical assistance from the Engineering Offices/DPWH,&#13;
which are familiar with works of comparable scale and will receive procurement training from&#13;
PISU; (b) construction/expansion of functional rooms in thb- 238 District Offices, with an average&#13;
unit cost of US$24,000 for each, and partial refurbishing of all other DOs, ROs and Baguio&#13;
Training Center (for Education Personnel), with an average unit cost of US$46,000 for each, will&#13;
be carried out through simplified procedures similar to national shopping (para. 4.10.c) by the&#13;
respective DECS-DO PBACs. The aggregated amount is estimated as US$6.5 million. (c) Other&#13;
civil works are the construction of 9,150 classrooms, 1,900 school office rooms for school heads&#13;
and staff, 2,000 school toilets and rehabilitation/repair of 23,700 existing classrooms, with an&#13;
total aggregated amount of US$194.9 million, and unit costs estimated at: (i) US$21,600-32,000&#13;
for each site of two to three new classrooms, (ii) US$4,800 and US$1,120 for each school office&#13;
room and set of school toilets, respectively; (iii) US$1,600 and US$4,800 for classroom&#13;
rehabilitation's and repairs, respectively.  All those works will be carried out under the&#13;
responsibility of Municipal Engineering Offices following one of four options, based on the&#13;
criteria given in para 4.10 (c) through (f) and ranked by decreasing order of preference: flnl,&#13;
simplified procurement procedures similar to national shopping through their respective&#13;
municipal PBAC; second, direct contract with communities; third, combination of simplified&#13;
procurement procedures similar to national shopping for the supply of site materials and direct&#13;
contract with communities for labor (Pakyaw); and, fkih, Force Account, with an aggregated&#13;
amount not to exceed US$39 million. The most appropriate options will be determined during&#13;
DEDP preparation and will be specified in the Memoranda of Agreement to be signed by the&#13;
LGUs and DECS DOs to become an integral part of the DEDPs (Technical Volume, Annex 10).&#13;
4.13 Goods (Equipment, kits. instructional materials. furniture). (a) The items to be procured&#13;
through ICB (total: US$71.0 million) are: computers for central, regional, divisional and district&#13;
offices; equipment and vehicles for distance education; copiers, textbooks and/or textbook paper&#13;
and printing and distribution contracts; 50 percent of the standardized school/classroom kits; (b)&#13;
items to be procured through NCB (total US$28.4 million) are: the remaining 50 percent of the&#13;
school/classroom kits, based on individual school needs and on an annual phased basis (with a&#13;
unit average amount estimated at US$170,000 by each of the 26 DOs); 50 percent of the school&#13;
furniture, with individual value per contract between US$50,000 and US$250,000; (c) other&#13;
procurement methods (total US$10.7 million) will apply to contracts managed by each DO on a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
phased annual basis, with an individual value below US$50,000, including: (i) the remaining 50&#13;
percent of the school furniture, which will be purchased through national shopping with&#13;
comparison of at least three price quotations, or direct contracts with communities in order to&#13;
involve them through the use of local labor; (ii) other equipment for the Divisions/Districts, to be&#13;
procured through national shopping.&#13;
4.14  Local and Foreign Consultancy Contracts (US$31.1 million). The bulk of consultant&#13;
services will be funded by the OECF Loan under procedures acceptable to OECF, and includes:&#13;
(a) the technical assistance to DECS-CO and the 26 DOs; (b) contracts with NGOs for the yearly&#13;
independent participatory audit; (c) the Eminent Educators Group, which will meet with the&#13;
TEEP Management Advisory Committee at least twice a year or at the request of the Project&#13;
Director, (d) assistance to management training, Monitoring and Evaluation and IEC.&#13;
Consultancies funded by IBRD include: (a) MIS development, implementation and training and&#13;
(b) contract services for INSET. Consultants' services contracts shall be awarded in accordance&#13;
with the "Guidelines for Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank&#13;
as Executing Agency" (August 1981). For complex, time-based assignments, such contracts&#13;
shall be based on the standard form of contract for consultant services issued by the Bank.&#13;
4.15  IBRD Review. Contracts for goods estimated at US$1.0 million or more, and consultant&#13;
services contracts in excess of US$100,000 for firms (US$50,000 for individuals) will be subject&#13;
to prior review by IBRD. With respect to all consultant services contracts in particular,&#13;
irrespective of value, prior review will be required for (a) terms of reference; (b) single source&#13;
contracts; (c) all assignments of critical nature (because of environmental safety or public health&#13;
considerations); and (d) contracts amendments raising the value to US$100,000 or above for&#13;
firm, (US$50,000 or - above for individuals). No civil works contracts are expected to reach the&#13;
Bank threshold of US$5.0 million for prior review. Works will be carried out under NCB&#13;
procedure. For each Division, each year the first NCB contract for works and the first two NCB&#13;
contracts for goods will be subject to prior review by IBRD. All the ICB and NCB contracts&#13;
which are not pre-reviewed, will be post reviewed by the Bank. For national shopping and direct&#13;
contracts (SBP), the post-review process by the Bank will cover an estimated 25 percent of the&#13;
total contracts in the first two years and, if the result is satisfactory, may be gradually reduced the&#13;
following years, to not less than five percent. The percentage of total contract values that will be&#13;
covered by the Bank's prior review will be 70 percent for goods and 1.5 percent for works.&#13;
4.16  Procurement information will be collected and recorded as follows: (a) prompt reporting&#13;
of contract award information by the Borrower; (b) comprehensive quarterly reports from PISU&#13;
to IBRD covering: (i) revised cost estimates for individual contracts and the whole project;&#13;
(ii) revised timing of the procurement actions, including advertising, bidding, contract awards&#13;
and completion time for individual contracts and (iii) compliance with aggregate limits on&#13;
specified methods of procurement.&#13;

for annually phased procurement of small scale works and site-materials, (ii) Direct contracts with local Communities&#13;
(pakyaw) for labor-intensive works as classroom constructions and furniture, (iii) Municipal force account when works are&#13;
too small or in areas too remote to attract contractors; and consultant services.&#13;

D. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
4.17 Disbursement Profile. The proposed IBRD Loan will be disbursed over seven and a half&#13;
years, to reflect the standard profile for PHR projects in the Philippines, plus the fact that the last&#13;
"batch" of provinces will be appraised in PY3. The project is expected to be completed on&#13;
December 31, 2003 and the Loan, closed on June 30, 2004. The experience with other education&#13;
projects reinforces the justification for a standard disbursement profile. Annex 16 shows&#13;
forecasts of expenditures and disbursements.&#13;
4.18   Disbursement Percentages. The IBRD Loan will be disbursed as follows:&#13;
Disbursement Category            IBRD Allocation              % of Expenditure to be&#13;
in US$ million              Financed by the Loan&#13;
1) Civil Works                              46.5                        50%&#13;
2) Goods (other than textbooks&#13;
and instructional materials)&#13;
(a) School and classroom kits           23.0                         35%&#13;
(b) School furniture                      2.2                        50%&#13;
(c) Other goods                           3.1           100% of foreign expenditures, 100% of local&#13;
expenditures (ex-factory cost) and 90% of&#13;
local expenditures for other items procured&#13;
locally&#13;
3) Textbooks and instructional materials    12.2            100% of foreign expenditures, 100% of local&#13;
expenditures (ex-factory cost) and 90% of&#13;
local expenditures for other items procured&#13;
locally&#13;
4) Training                                 12.4            100% of foreign expenditures and 25% of&#13;
local expenditures&#13;
5) SIIF Grants                               2.1                        90%&#13;
6) Consultants' services                     1.8                        100%&#13;
7) Unallocated                              10.1&#13;
Total                                      113.4&#13;
4.19   Documentation  requirements.   Disbursements will follow  two  parallel channels:&#13;
(a) DECS for all TEEP expenditures other than the School Building Program (SBP, covering&#13;
school construction, rehabilitation and repair); and (b) the Municipal Development Fund (MDF)&#13;
for the SBP. AAA. Non-SBP disbursements will fall under three categories: (i) for training and&#13;
workshops, they will be made against Statements of expenditures (SOEs) prepared by DECS-&#13;
DOs and consolidated by DECS-CO for submission to the Bank (and OECF); (ii) for goods and&#13;
services under contracts of less than US$1.0 million for goods and US$5.0 million for civil&#13;
works, they will also be made against SOEs, with supporting documentation retained by the DOs&#13;
for review by IBRD supervision missions; (iii) all other disbursements will be made against fully&#13;
documented withdrawal applications. BBB. For SBP expenditures, the initial payments to&#13;
contractors will be made directly by the Municipal LGUs, in tranches (4 per school) out of their&#13;
own resources (which in turn could be covered partly by MDF advances out of GoP counterpart&#13;
funds). At monthly intervals, they will be reimbursed by the MDF (through the Offices of Local&#13;
Treasurers). The Municipalities will maintain complete records, by site, of works completed and&#13;
funds disbursed, including Certificates of Completion signed by the Municipal Engineer and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
countersigned by the Mayor and the Division Superintendent or his/her designated&#13;
Representative.&#13;
4.20  Special Accounts. To accelerate disbursements and, in the case of DECS, allow for direct&#13;
payment of other eligible local and foreign expenditures, GoP will open and maintain two&#13;
Special Accounts (SA) within an Authorized Government Deposit Bank (AGDB): (a) one to be&#13;
managed by DECS-CO; and (b) the other one managed by the MDF. Both SAs will be in US&#13;
Dollars and will have an Authorized Allocation (AA) of US$3 million each, based on four&#13;
months of expected expenditures. IBRD will make an initial deposit of US$1.5 million on each&#13;
SA. For each SA, the full amount of the AA will be released when disbursements for their&#13;
respective components equal or exceed US$20 million. Applications for replenishment of the&#13;
SAs supported by appropriate documentation will be submitted monthly by DECS-CO and&#13;
MDF. IBRD will replenish the SAs upon receipt of satisfactory proof of incurred eligible&#13;
expenditures. Similar arrangements will be made for OECF funds.&#13;
4.21 GoP Advances to the TEEP Provinces. AAA. DECS-DOs will make payments related to&#13;
all non SBP expenditures planned in their approved DEDP, while the MDF will be responsible&#13;
for SBP-related payments. For DECS-managed expenditures, in each Division, there will be two&#13;
separate accounts, one funded by the DECS SA--called WB Project Account (WBPA)--and the&#13;
other for GoP counterpart funding--called Government Project Account (GPA). In each TEEP&#13;
province, DECS-DO will open a WBPA in the AGDB local branch, and DECS-CO will transfer&#13;
to it, from the SA, an initial advance equivalent to 90 days of estimated expenditures. The&#13;
DECS-DOs will be responsible for transmitting to DECS-CO satisfactory proof of incurred&#13;
eligible expenditures for preparation of replenishment applications. In parallel, DECS-CO will&#13;
delegate to each DECS-DO their approved DEDP budget allocation except for the SBP&#13;
expenditures, and DBM will transfer the funds to each Division-level GPA. BBB. For SBP-&#13;
related expenditures, budget allocations will be deposited into an MDF GPA at the central level.&#13;
The Bank's MDF SA will be used only to reimburse expenditures already financed out of the&#13;
GoP's SBP counterpart funds (deposited in the MDF GPA). No advances will be made out of&#13;
the MDF SA to the lower LGU levels. The MDF will make to the Municipalities an initial&#13;
advance from the GOP counterpart account, not to exceed 25 percent (on average) of the total&#13;
cost of the SBP for the year and LGU in question.  Subsequent MDF transfers to the&#13;
Municipalities will be reimbursements of actual expenditures. Similar procedures will be&#13;
followed for OECF.&#13;
E. AUDITS AND ACCOUNTING&#13;
4.22  Project expenditures will be recorded using the central Government's accounting&#13;
procedures as promulgated by the Commission on Audit (COA). Audits of project accounts,&#13;
both SAs and all PAs will be currently audited by the appropriate level of COA, according to&#13;
GoP's procedures which are acceptable to the Bank. The current recording system will be&#13;
slightly modified to easily segregate the project accounts and facilitate audit later on.&#13;
Documentation processes will also follow the GoP's procedures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
4.23 Civil Works Audits. Every month the MLGUs will summarize project transactions and&#13;
send copies of them, together with supporting evidence, to DECS-DOs. The MLGUs will&#13;
prepare the corresponding SOEs and transmit copy of them to COA for certification prior to their&#13;
submission to MDF for replenishment. Local COA will establish ex-post whether its standards&#13;
have been complied with. Should COA determine that this is not the case, the corresponding&#13;
amounts will be automatically deducted from the next invoice submitted by the MLGU.&#13;
4.24  Audits of Project Accounts. The Statement of Expenditures and the Special Accounts&#13;
will follow a well developed procedure acceptable to the Bank. SOE supporting documentation&#13;
will be maintained at least a year after the completion of the audit for the fiscal year in which the&#13;
last withdrawal was made. The audit report covering a one year period will be submitted to the&#13;
Bank not later than six months after the end of the audit period.&#13;
4.25  Participatory Performance Audits (PPA). Every year, the joint annual review will be&#13;
based on a report combining the traditional financial indicators and a PPA to be conducted (four&#13;
month prior to the review) by NGOs in all the active TEEP Provinces. The PPAs will focus on&#13;
(i) delivery and use of instructional materials; and the use of beneficiary assessment techniques&#13;
to identify stakeholders' perception of problems and acceptable resolutions; (ii) delivery and&#13;
classroom impact of the INSET program; (iii) implementation of the SBP; (iv) frequency and&#13;
impact of contacts between school and community; and (v) progress in making teaching/learning&#13;
process more interactive. TORs are in the Technical Volume.&#13;
F. IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
4.26  Project implementation will be characterized by piloting, phasing, and incremental levels&#13;
of complexity, as project entities(DOs, schools...) demonstrate increases in absorptive capacity.&#13;
Because the last batch of TEEP provinces will come on stream in PY3, implementation will last&#13;
a total of seven years. Annual resource allocations based on national and divisional work plans&#13;
and budgets, will allow detailed implementation monitoring. During PYI, implementation will&#13;
be limited to the national level and the first six pilot provinces; it will concentrate on capacity-&#13;
building, and on testing the pilots, procedures, and systems, developed during preparation,&#13;
including the contracting of service suppliers, the MIS, the development of demonstration school&#13;
and clusters, and devolution of school construction/maintenance to LGUs. Preparation of the&#13;
next "batch" of 8 provinces will be initiated, building on lessons learned from the pilots.&#13;
4.27 Project Launch Workshops (PLWs). One initial PLW will be organized with donor&#13;
participation, followed by province-specific PLWs by the DECS Team. The goal will be to&#13;
ensure that (a) all stakeholders have a common understanding of all project components,&#13;
(b) donor procedures for procurement, disbursement, accounting, auditing, and legal aspects are&#13;
fully understood; (c) all implementors are clear about their work program for PYI; (d) lessons&#13;
from the preparation process are learned for the benefit of the next batch of provinces. In&#13;
subsequent years, donors will participate selectively in PLWs. Video-cassettes will be taped for&#13;
the Bank's input.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
4.28  Joint Annual Reviews.  Each year the Project Director, based on the technical&#13;
recommendation of the PISU, and on the monitoring reports of the Regional Officials and Project&#13;
Management Advisory Committee, will conduct, by September 30, (a) a review of new DEDP&#13;
proposals on the basis of the TEEP Guidelines and (b) a review of on-going DEDPs based on&#13;
physical, qualitative and financial data collected through the participatory performance audit&#13;
(PPA). The review will look at work plans and budgets against progress as reported by PISU and&#13;
donors. The format for progress reporting and workplans is presented in the TEEP Guidelines.&#13;
By March 30 of each year, another review will focus on budget requirements for the next FY. At&#13;
negotiations, GoP gave assurances that based on agreed Terms of Reference, it shall furnish to&#13;
the Bank. (i) a quarterly Progress Report by February 28 (Budget Review), May 31, August 31,&#13;
and November 30 of each year; (ii) a full annual Report by August 31 of each year; and (iii) a&#13;
mid-term Report on or about August 31, 2000.&#13;
4.29 Mid-term Review. This review, to be held by September 30, 2000, will assess: (a) the&#13;
status of implementation, (b) the likelihood that the objectives will be achieved at the end of the&#13;
project; (c) the project's likely impact after completion; (d) sustainability. It will determine the&#13;
work/study program for the rest of TEEP's life, including a draft plan for ensuring sustainability.&#13;
4.30  Supervision. The Supervision Plan is in Annex 13. The PISU will organize two&#13;
supervision - cum - training missions/year per province. The donors will conduct semi-annual&#13;
missions and may join any of the PISU missions to the Provinces. This will require the use of&#13;
PISU national consultants whose reports will be shared with the donors. The main annual review&#13;
with donors will be based on the PPAs. Donors supervision missions will be thematic. TEEP&#13;
Guidelines will be reviewed in light of experience. Changes will have to be endorsed by the&#13;
Steering Committee and reviewed by the donors. A special focus of supervision will be the&#13;
quality of the appraisals conducted by PISU for the second and third batch, and the effectiveness&#13;
of the PPAs to be conducted partly by NGOs.&#13;
4.31  Implementation Completion Report. Within six months of the Closing Date, PISU will&#13;
submit project data required by the Bank to prepare an ICR, including a sustainability plan. This&#13;
will be a participatory exercise. The findings will be shared to learn from the experience.&#13;
G. MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
4.32  Baseline data were established for all project components, although an important&#13;
capacity-building exercise during PYI will be to validate these data to strengthen monitoring.&#13;
Starting from this base, the instruments to be used to monitor project implementation and its&#13;
impact on the sub-sector in the targeted provinces include:&#13;
* Student assessments to be conducted in PY2, PY4 and PY6&#13;
* The research program, especially a survey of school-based determinants of quality&#13;
and drop-out, to begin in PYl&#13;
*  The MIS, which includes a module to track physical, qualitative and financial&#13;
performance against Divisional work plans and budgets (Technical Volume)&#13;
&#149;  The PISU quarterly progress reports and donors biannual supervision reports&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
* The (Divisional) participatory performance audits, to be collated as a basis for the&#13;
joint annual reviews&#13;
* The mid-term review (2000), to be preceded by a full blown Beneficiary Assessment&#13;
* Yearly implementors' conference on lessons learned.&#13;
4.33 The PISU, each TEEP DO, and each beneficiary school will have their own, more micro,&#13;
monitoring instruments. Training and specialist services are costed in the umbrella contract.&#13;
H. STATUS OF PREPARATION&#13;
4.34  The findings of the preparation studies have already been reflected in project design,&#13;
particularly regarding cost-effective educational investments, the importance of Early Childhood&#13;
programs in improving school readiness in early grades, the design of INSET, and the need to&#13;
pay attention to school processes and to develop a culture of information-based decision-making.&#13;
The appraisal process reviewed the sectoral financial policies, the six pilot DEDPs, the project's&#13;
management arrangements, DECS' Project Implementation Plan, and draft TEEP Guidelines.&#13;
New school designs and specifications are being finalized, as well as the criteria for selection of&#13;
the implementation method.  Workshops were organized with UNICEF to develop the&#13;
multigrade demonstration schools and with CIDA for the design and implementation of the&#13;
pedagogical decentralization reform. Procurement for textbook paper is about to be launched.&#13;
I. SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
4.35 At present education is primarily a Central Government expenditure responsibility. The&#13;
sector accounts for a relatively high share of GoP's budget (26 percent), which is to be&#13;
maintained, as per the Memorandum of Policy. However, within the education budget, there has&#13;
been a decline in the share of elementary education from its peak of 60 percent in 1987 to around&#13;
54 percent in 1993. LGUs have been active in financing education, with their average share&#13;
increasing from 2 percent in 1990 to about 7 percent in 1993. The school building program&#13;
(SBP) component of the overall education budget will be partially devolved to the LGUs in&#13;
1997. It is expected that the average shares of the LGUs in financing the SBP costs in their&#13;
localities will increase rapidly each subsequent year, with devolution substantially completed by&#13;
1999.&#13;
4.36 The DEDPs embrace the entire elementary education program for the 26 provinces. The&#13;
TEEP interventions result in substantial investments in these provinces that would not have&#13;
occurred without the project. Hence, it is important to ensure that the costs associated with the&#13;
implementation of the DEDPs are sustainable. The ability of the GoP to finance the project was&#13;
analyzed by comparing the projected GoP budget allocated to elementary education to the&#13;
projected subsidy associated with delivering elementary education in the TEEP provinces during&#13;
the project life. These comparisons identified the annual financing deficits/surpluses within each&#13;
budget category. The current GoP budget was projected to 2003 using the growth rates of&#13;
government consumption expenditure from the CAS and the capital account was projected using&#13;
the growth rates of government investment. The budgets were projected in three different&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
categories: personal services, maintenance and operating expenditures (MOOE) and capital&#13;
expenditures. According to the Memorandum of Policy, the share of the education budget&#13;
allocated to elementary education will increase from its current level (47 percent in 1995) to 60&#13;
percent in the year 2001 and stay constant thereafter. This assumption is built into the&#13;
projections of the GoP's budget constraint. Three alternate scenarios for projecting the GoP&#13;
budget constraint are analyzed, and the results are shown in Annex 2, Table 9.&#13;
4.37   Scenario 1.  In 1996, the share of the 26 TEEP provinces in the elementary education&#13;
budget is 16.7 percent. Scenario 1 assumes that this share will stay constant throughout the&#13;
project. The analysis shows that the projected subsidy requirement for elementary education&#13;
cannot be met by the GoP budget allocated to the 26 TEEP provinces till 2001. There is a&#13;
shortfall in the capital account in 2002, but the current account shows a surplus, which results in&#13;
an overall surplus in 2002. By the year 2003, both the capital and current accounts show a&#13;
surplus. The cumulative shortfall over the period 1997-2003 is 2.88 billion pesos, which is four&#13;
percent of the cumulative national budget allocated to elementary education in these provinces&#13;
for current and capital expenditures, and 0.78 percent of the total cumulative elementary&#13;
education budget. The deficit points to the need to explore alternative scenarios to reallocate&#13;
budgets in line with the increased GoP emphasis on elementary education, and the GoP's&#13;
intention to target resources to the TEEP provinces, as per the Memorandum of Policy.&#13;
4.38   Scenario 2.  In Scenario 2, the share of the TEEP provinces in elementary education is&#13;
increased to 20 percent. This is roughly proportional to the number of 6-12 year old children in&#13;
4&#13;
the TEEP provinces.  The capital account exhibits a deficit till 2001, after which it shows a&#13;
surplus. The current account, on the other hand, shows a surplus in all years of the project. By&#13;
looking at the overall subsidy requirements, without regard to the distinction between capital&#13;
investments and the current account, the results show that the subsidy requirement can be met in&#13;
all years except 1998 and 1999. During the project period, 1997 to 2003, there is a cumulative&#13;
surplus of 10.5 billion pesos, which is about 7.8 percent of the total elementary education budget&#13;
going to these provinces, and 2.8 percent of the total elementary education , budget allocated to&#13;
current expenditures. The analysis shows that with reallocations across the capital and current&#13;
accounts, and across years, the GoP has the ability to finance and sustain the project.&#13;
4.39   Scenario 3. Scenario 3 retains the 20 percent share of the TEEP provinces and assumes&#13;
that the costs of the incremental SBP in these provinces will be shared by the LGUs, in line with&#13;
the proposed devolution of the SBP. The assumption is that the LGUs will finance 25 percent of&#13;
the overall SBP in these provinces, or approximately 50 percent of the incremental SBP. The cost&#13;
sharing relaxes the budget constraint for the capital account, and results in lower capital account&#13;
deficits till 2001, after which the capital account shows a surplus. The cumulative surplus over&#13;
the period 1997-2003 increases to 11.10 billion pesos, indicating a need for rephasing capital&#13;
expenditures, which will be addressed during implementation. In this scenario, the LGUs' ability&#13;
The exact numbers depend on the alternate estimates (from DECS records or calculations based on the 1994&#13;
FIES) of the proportion of children of elementary school going age in these provinces, which can be taken as a&#13;
crude index of need.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
to finance their share of the SBP is assessed for the 6 pilot provinces. The analysis shows&#13;
profiles of the income and expenditures over the project years. The projections includes a&#13;
substantial increase in the internal revenue allocations (IRA) to these LGUs of about 29 percent&#13;
in 1997, and subsequent increases of at least 12 percent. The current analysis shows yearly&#13;
surpluses for all six provinces which indicate that the cost-sharing schemes are sustainable even&#13;
at the LGU level. Fiscal sustainability studies will be conducted for each of the 20 provinces that&#13;
will come on-stream in the next two batches of TEEP to ensure that the DEDPs are sustainable&#13;
for each province. The analysis demonstrates that GoP's ability to finance TEEP is limited under&#13;
the current allocation of 16.7 percent going to the TEEP provinces. Increased targeting of&#13;
resources to these provinces, in line with the GoP policy, will indeed make the financing of the&#13;
project sustainable if the current macroeconomic projections are realized.&#13;
4.40  GoP's plan is to extend the proposed reform nationwide, if implementation is successful.&#13;
Institutional sustainability should be enhanced by the fact that, in the poorest provinces, the&#13;
process of decentralization will receive special support under the project. The more affluent non-&#13;
TEEP provinces are expected to spontaneously initiate a similar change. A project study (PY2)&#13;
will estimate the cost savings resulting from DECS-CO transfer of authority which will be&#13;
reallocated to finance its enhanced oversight function.&#13;
J. POVERTY, ENVIRONMENT AND GENDER&#13;
4.41  Poverty. The project is geographically targeted and, within the targeted provinces,&#13;
phasing will begin with the most disadvantaged districts. The SIIF will direct proportionately&#13;
more grants at marginalized schools. The pilot voucher scheme will target the poorest&#13;
households. Criteria for all these schemes have been agreed.&#13;
4.42 Environmental Aspects. The project will have no adverse impact on the environment.&#13;
The SBP will comply with national regulations such as the logging ban and with United Nations&#13;
regulations forbidding the use of asbestos. Indigenous people will benefit: they will be&#13;
consulted about their perceived educational needs, during DEDP preparation and&#13;
implementation, and the project includes provisions for indigenization of the curriculum and&#13;
instructional materials. School-mapping will be participatory, and, should there be cases where&#13;
land or other property have to be acquired for school construction, the Framework for&#13;
Resettlement (para. 3.44) would ensure that the affected groups would be duly compensated. It is&#13;
anticipated that there will be a minimal number of such cases. Environmentally-oriented&#13;
proposals will be eligible for school grants under SIIF.&#13;
4.43  Gender. As indicated in para. 2.9, gender inequity seems to hurt boys more than girls.&#13;
The revision of textbooks will apply the existing gender sensitivity norms. Wherever children,&#13;
boys or girls, are found to be in especially difficult circumstances (because of work, disabilities,&#13;
ethnic background...) or to have particular needs in the TEEP provinces, their needs will be&#13;
addressed under the DEDPs, albeit initially on a pilot basis. For instance, modular teaching will&#13;
be experimented with for migrant and nomadic children.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
5. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. BENEFITS&#13;
5.1   First, the project will directly benefit about 2.3 million children, 70 percent of whom&#13;
come from poor families. Based on previous studies, the provision of textbooks and furniture&#13;
alone could improve learning achievements by 20 percent. The completion rate, which averages&#13;
55 percent in the targeted provinces, with a range of 30-80, could reach 64, and even 71 percent&#13;
under a low and a high case scenarios. Up to 250,000 new school places will provide access to&#13;
better quality elementary education. This will yield intrinsic equity, intergenerational benefits&#13;
for these children and their families in terms of welfare, prospects for better health, lower&#13;
fertility, higher life expectancy, and earnings potential. For society, by closing the educational&#13;
quality gap between rich and poor it will reduce the risk of unrest among young people without a&#13;
stake in the development of their country, which could deter foreign or national investors on&#13;
whom growth is highly dependent. Second, besides improving equity the project will help GoP&#13;
to operationalize several other SRA strategies, such as empowermnent and enhanced economic&#13;
opportunities (through community school construction). Intensive capacity-building at the&#13;
central and provincial levels will support an orderly decentralization of education, and more&#13;
generally, the redefinition of roles between the different levels of DECS. The cost-sharing ratio&#13;
will expand education financing and make it more progressive. Third, insofar as GoP is using&#13;
the project to test a more effective delivery mechanism for education -- decentralized, flexible,&#13;
incremental and result-oriented -- TEEP could, once the model is implemented countrywide,&#13;
have a large multiplier effect and notably improve the cost-effectiveness of educational spending.&#13;
B. RISKS&#13;
5.2   Changes of the magnitude desired by all stakeholders will have to be systemic and&#13;
sustained, involving commensurate risks at the macro, sectoral, and project levels.&#13;
5.3   At the macro level, the main risk is that, if the fast growth of the past two years were to&#13;
falter, the GoP could not honor its financial conunitments arising from TEEP and&#13;
implementation would slow down. This risk can only be monitored. Even if the project&#13;
succeeded in equalizing access to quality education, its full benefits will only be captured if this&#13;
was complemented by policies to create rural employment. There is reason to be optimistic in&#13;
the seriousness with which the GoP is observing its IMF targets and has started to restore, at least&#13;
partly, the primacy of education in the budgetary allocations of the past two years.&#13;
5.4   At the sectoral level, wavering commitment to targeting and insufficient stability in&#13;
policy directions could undermine an undertaking -- quality education for the poor -- which is&#13;
likely to require a 10-20 years time horizon. Presidential support of social targeting and the&#13;
country's ambitions to become a Newly Industrialized Economy, East Asia style, offer hope that&#13;
the GoP will stay the course. As a complementary strategy, the advocacy campaign should&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
create broad grassroots support for TEEP and what it stands for -- democratic governance,&#13;
transparency -- which are highly prized values in modem Philippines society.&#13;
5.5   At the project level, three types of risks can be identified. The complexity inherent in&#13;
TEEP's systemic approach, combined with the shift away from standardized, centralized norms&#13;
might exceed DECS' capacity to absorb change. This risk has been reduced to manageable&#13;
proportions through the use of piloting and phasing. Another risk is that of a loss of original&#13;
focus due to the demands of implementation: political pressure to accelerate or modify the&#13;
inclusion of new provinces might force too much corner-cutting; the process of consultation&#13;
might become more apparent than real; or, the unavoidable disruptions created by the transition&#13;
towards decentralization might trigger a resurgence of traditional, controlling behaviors.&#13;
Extensive popular participation and transparency in project preparation and implementation are&#13;
expected to counter the likelihood of this occurring. A third risk lies in the limited pool of staff&#13;
experienced in project appraisal techniques at the center and in planning, budgeting and&#13;
management in the DOs. The safeguards adopted to mitigate this risk include: the emphasis on&#13;
upfront capacity-building and systematic learning from experience; the gradual transfer of&#13;
responsibilities as individuals and units demonstrate their ability to take on new roles; the TEEP&#13;
Guidelines, in which the stakeholders will be trained, to ensure that there is clarity of roles and&#13;
responsibilities; the yearly controls built in the workplan and budget approval process and annual&#13;
reviews, which will allow the GoP and the donors to identify emerging problems and jointly&#13;
devise solutions; and the use of specialists/consultants in the PISU.&#13;
5.6  In all three areas, the other donors supporting the project --OECF, AusAID, UNICEF,&#13;
CIDA and UNDP, ADB, Ireland-- will have an important support role to play by closely&#13;
coordinating, systematically using the indicators as compass, and nurturing a constructive&#13;
dialogue in problem areas. Despite careful design and appraisal, the GoP and the donors&#13;
recognize that there are residual risks linked to TEEP's innovativeness in an environment&#13;
traditionally more interested in developing new plans than in implementing them. These risks&#13;
are considered worth taking, given the problems in the present system.&#13;

THIRD ELEMENTARY EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
A. COHERENCE WITH ESW/SECTOR PRIORITIES&#13;
1.    Educational attainment in the Philippines compares favorably with most other countries of&#13;
similar per capita income. But there are substantial variations in quality and access to such services, and&#13;
deficiencies in education infrastructure, especially in rural areas. Improving the access to quality&#13;
primary education is a central part of the GoP's and the Bank's poverty alleviation strategy, and the&#13;
Third Elementary Education Project (TEEP) is intended to be an important instrument to further this&#13;
objective.&#13;
Disparities in Educational Outcomes&#13;
2.     According to official service statistics, the net _nrollment ratio, defined as the percentage of the&#13;
population of 7-12 year children enrolled in school, in the Philippines is high, at 87.14%1 in the school&#13;
year 1994-95. The national average however obscures the wide variations in the different provinces in&#13;
the Philippines. The net enrollment ratio2 ranges from 58% in Marawi City to 65% in Basilan and&#13;
almost 100% in Ilocos Norte. Independent confirmation of the official enrollment estimates based on&#13;
household survey data is not available. The high enrollment rates present an incomplete picture. About&#13;
68% of children who enrolled did not complete primary school, and of those who dropped out, 60% did&#13;
so in the first two years. The average years of schooling among the dropouts in 1994/95 was 2.8 years.&#13;
The low primary school completion rates are largely the result of high drop out rates rather than high&#13;
repetition rates.  There are also disparities in primary school completion rates: children from&#13;
economically depressed regions drop out disproportionately. The learning achievements of children, as&#13;
measured by the achievement test scores of those who do stay in school, can be taken as an index of the&#13;
value added by education and a measure of the quality of education. The provincial variation in&#13;
enrollment rates and completion rates is also mirrored in achievement test scores, with provincial test&#13;
scores ranging from 54 in Masbate to 102 in the National Capital.&#13;
3.    Increasing the enrollment and completion rates among the poor in primary school and improving&#13;
their achievement test scores are important objectives for this project. The project will focus on&#13;
improving the disparity in the access to quality education.&#13;
Educational Outcomes and Poverty&#13;
4.     Provincial disparities. First, we examine the link at the provincial level between poverty and&#13;
educational outcomes (enrollment rates and achievement test scores) using regression analysis. The&#13;
living standard of the province is proxied by using the average per capita expenditure of the province as&#13;
the measure of welfare. The per capita expenditure of the province is computed from the 1994 Family&#13;
Income and Expenditure Survey (1994 FIES). Data on net enrollments and the achievement test scores&#13;
The gross enrollment ratio is even higher at 110, and is the third highest in Asia, after Brunei and Korea,&#13;
countries with much higher per capita income. Enrollment statistics are provided by the Department of&#13;
Education, Culture and Sports (DECS).&#13;
2   The net enrollment rate is referred to as the participation rate in the statistics reported by the DECS.&#13;

shows that provinces with higher per capita expenditures have higher enrollment rates and achievement&#13;
test scores. Figures 1 and 2 plot the estimated relationship between the net enrollment ratio and&#13;
achievement test score respectively, and the per capita consumption expenditure of the province. The&#13;
project provinces are highlighted on the graphs. The primary school completion rates for all the&#13;
provinces were unavailable for 1994. However, a similar relationship has been estimated between&#13;
primary school completion rates and family income in 19913.&#13;

5.     Differences across poor and non-poor households. How are primary school enrollments&#13;
distributed across income groups? In the Philippines, the analysis is hampered by the lack of a nationally&#13;
representative multipurpose household survey that collects data on both enrollments and per capita&#13;
expenditure. There is however some information that can shed light on this question. In 1992, a&#13;
questionnaire was administered to the bottom three income deciles of households, as identified in the&#13;
1991 Family Income Expenditure Survey (FIES) to understand to what extent the poor were reached by&#13;
public programs.4 Seven percent of all children 7-12 years of age in these households were not attending&#13;
school, with the ratio being 7.6% for males and 6.1% for females. This ratio increases dramatically for&#13;
13-16 year old children, to 29.2% for males and 19.5% for females.&#13;
6.     The FIES does however allow us to establish the link between the highest educational&#13;
attainments of all individuals 10 years and older and household expenditure. The 1994 PIES data were&#13;
used for this analysis. The regional poverty lines estimated for the Philippines poverty study were&#13;
updated to 1994 prices using the regional consumer price indices5 and used to identify poor households.&#13;
Per capita consumption expenditure is the chosen measure of welfare in this analysis. In 1994, 46% of&#13;
the population in the Philippines was identified as being poor. Sixty percent of the population 10 years&#13;
and older living in poor households has six or less years of education, and thirty percent have between 7&#13;
and 10 years of schooling, and only 5% have any college education. In sharp contrast, one third of the&#13;
individuals in non-poor households have 6 or less years of education, 37% have 7-10 years of schooling,&#13;
and about 28% have some college education.&#13;
7.     The link between poverty and education can also be illustrated by examining the incidence of&#13;
poverty by the educational attainment of the household head (see Figure 3). The incidence, depth and&#13;
severity of poverty (as measured by the Foster-Greer-Thorbecke class of poverty measures) are much&#13;
higher for households headed by less educated heads than college educated household heads. But in&#13;
terms of contribution to national poverty, 35% of the total poor live in households headed by individuals&#13;
who have some schooling but have not completed primary school, and another 31% live in households&#13;
headed by individuals who have completed primary school. This is an important fact. Education has&#13;
important inter-generational benefits:parents with more education face a lower risk of poverty, are likely&#13;
to value education more and, consequently, are more likely to invest in their children's education.&#13;
Hence, there are important inter-generational benefits to investing in children's education today. The&#13;
next section ) analyses the determinants of these differential enrollments and primary school completion&#13;
rates. This is a first step towards designing policy options to improve educational outcomes (enrollments&#13;
and primary school completion). Then we examine the determinants of achievement test scores and the&#13;
design of interventions to improve these scores.&#13;

Educational Attainment of Household Head&#13;
Determinants of Enrollments and Primary School Completion&#13;
8.     At each level of schooling, a household will choose to invest in education if the anticipated&#13;
future benefits (discounted) exceed the estimated costs, subject to the constraints faced by the household.&#13;
The private benefits to additional education include the higher earnings and economic mobility as a&#13;
result of increased productivity. The costs of schooling include a vector of variables that reflect prices&#13;
associated with school attendance, and includes the monetary cost of going to school (monthly fees,&#13;
registration fees, uniforms etc.), the distance to the nearest school, and the availability of public and&#13;
private schools of a given level in the community. In addition, the opportunity cost of the child's time&#13;
both in the labor market and household activities is an important component of the indirect cost of&#13;
schooling. School quality increases the benefits of schooling in this framework, and ceteris paribus&#13;
increases the demand for schooling.&#13;
9.     The characteristics of the child and the socio-economic background of the family are also&#13;
important determinants of the demand for schooling. What is the evidence for the Philippines of the&#13;
determinants of the demand for schooling? Households in the bottom three income deciles in the Family&#13;
Income and Expenditure Survey in 1991, were administered a special questionnaire in 1992. Out of&#13;
school children belonging to these households were asked why they dropped out (Herrin and Racelis,&#13;
1994). Lack of interest is the main reason reported by 45 percent of the 7-12 year old children for&#13;
dropping out of school. Admittedly, the lack of interest variable is hard to interpret. But for the 7-12&#13;
year olds, it may be the result of supply related factors (such as lack of learning materials, inadequate&#13;
curricula etc.). The low quality and relevance of education, combined with low growth of modern sector&#13;
employment may lead to a perception of low private returns to education among parents. Almost a fifth&#13;
of the children drop out of school because of inaccessibility and the high cost of education, an indication&#13;
that these factors are important deterrents to poor children staying in school. We look at additional&#13;
evidence to better understand which factors are important in explaining why children drop out of school.&#13;
10.    Private Costs of Education. First, we look at the evidence on the private costs of schooling in&#13;
public elementary schools, and then examine if these costs are significant deterrents to attending and&#13;
completing primary school. In principle, no tuition is charged in public elementary schools, yet there are&#13;
additional costs associated with going to school. Preliminary evidence from a study conducted by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -                                       Annex 2&#13;
Fund for Assistance to Private Education (FAPE)6 on the costs of private and public schools at the&#13;
different levels of education shows that despite low fees, there are significant private costs (on&#13;
educational supplies and uniforms, transportation and boarding) to attending public elementary schools.&#13;
11.    Evidence from  1994 FIES. The FIES collects data on education expenditures, including its&#13;
breakdown into the categories of fees, allowances for family members staying away from home, books,&#13;
school supplies, and other educational supplies, for all households. This expenditure cannot however be&#13;
related to the number of children currently in school or their level of enrollment. According to&#13;
calculations from the FIES, Filipino households spent 31,907 million pesos on education in 1994.&#13;
12.    Next, we examine the affordability of primary education for the population. The education&#13;
financing report estimated that the unit cost of elementary education is 4085 pesos per student in 1994.&#13;
The share of the private sector in this unit cost is 30.4%. These unit costs are computed on the basis of&#13;
both private and public sector enrollments. However, since the share of the public sector in elementary&#13;
school enrollments was about 93% in 1994, the unit costs of public primary schooling are likely to be in&#13;
this range. Using a constant private cost of elementary schooling (computed as 30.4% of the unit cost of&#13;
elementary school), we compute the affordability ratio as the ratio of the private cost of elementary&#13;
education to per capita expenditure. Figure 4 shows the results. In the bottom quintile, this ratio is&#13;
almost 35%, and this falls to about 5% for the richest quintile. The trends are similar to those found in&#13;
Indonesia for primary schooling: in 1989, the cost to income ratio for the poorest decile was 38%, and it&#13;
rose to 17% for the richest decile. The costs of schooling are clearly a greater burden for the poor than&#13;
for the non-poor.&#13;

13.    Do Costs Deter Enrollments and Completion? There are no recent studies in the Philippines&#13;
on the determinants of the demand for education. The Herrin and Racelis (1994) study shows that about&#13;
8% of the 7-12 year old children from poor households drop out because the costs are too high. In&#13;
addition, there are useful lessons on the elasticity of demand with respect to price, from other countries,&#13;

such as Indonesia. King (1995)7 investigates the determinants of school enrollments and transition rates&#13;
between education levels for Indonesia in 1989. Indonesia achieved dramatic increases in enrollment&#13;
rates: the net enrollment rates rose from 68% in 1960 to 89% in 1989. There is concern that some of this&#13;
expansion was achieved at the cost of quality. In addition, students drop out significantly beyond the 7-&#13;
12 age group. These are much the same concerns as in the Philippines. The paper finds that poverty&#13;
deters school attendance (entry into primary school), and that the price of schooling matters, that is,&#13;
lower fees, the greater availability of public primary schools in the district, and a shorter distance to a&#13;
primary school raise the probability of attending primary school. The prospect of a higher return to&#13;
primary education does not appear to be a significant factor in the decision to enter school. The decision&#13;
to continue schooling to the lower secondary level is also affected by the costs of schooling. In fact, the&#13;
elasticity of demand with respect to school fees and distance to school are higher for the poor than the&#13;
non-poor. In addition, the results show that the opportunity cost of school attendance for 10-13 olds is an&#13;
important deterrent to enrollments.&#13;
14.    Distance to School. The costs of going to school include the time costs of travelling to the&#13;
school and the transportation costs in reaching school. For the Philippines, at the provincial level,&#13;
regression analysis using data for 97 provincial units, shows that there is no significant link between the&#13;
net enrollment rates in a province and the regional distribution of schools, as proxied by the percentage&#13;
of barangays without schools within the province8. The Household School Matching Survey II (HSMS&#13;
II) data collected in 1990 under the Second Elementary Education project has information on the&#13;
distance between the home and school for pupils enrolled in school. These results are admittedly based&#13;
on a select sample of students who are enrolled in school, and hence does not tell us directly about&#13;
children who are not enrolled in school.9 In fact, it may well be the case that one of the reasons that the&#13;
children dropped out of school is precisely because it was too far. The estimates, therefore, can be&#13;
considered as a conservative estimate of the true distance facing all children A large proportion of these&#13;
children (73% in Grade 1) travel less than I km to reach school. Children in the higher grades (Grades 4&#13;
and 6) do have to travel slightly longer distances to reach school than children in grade 1, with 42% of&#13;
Grade 6 children travelling more than 2 km.&#13;
15.    Opportunity Costs. We also use the previous study to understand the alternate demands on the&#13;
children's time. A significant fraction (25-30%) of children in Grades 4 and 6 work in income&#13;
generating activities often or always, but the corresponding number is much lower for Grade I children.&#13;
Most children also help in doing household chores. In poorer households, the opportunity costs may well&#13;
be high enough to keep children out of school. Evidence from Indonesia show that it is indeed the case&#13;
(see King, (1995), and Table 5).&#13;
16.    School Quality. There is little direct evidence (using household survey data and school data) in&#13;
the Philippines on the impact of improved school quality on school enrollments. There is, however,&#13;
convincing evidence of its impact on learning outcomes which is explored in the next section. The&#13;
Education financing report (World Bank 1996) uses provincial data to show that some school staffing&#13;

characteristics (especially related to the distribution of principals (principals/school, principal/teacher)&#13;
have an impact on elementary school completion rates. The same report also shows that there are&#13;
provincial imbalances in school staffing characteristics that are correlated with provincial income. This&#13;
evidence, albeit crude, does suggest that more effective targeting of the available educational resources&#13;
to poor areas is needed to reduce the disparities in schooling outcomes. In addition, a study by de&#13;
Guzman and Cortes (1995)10 uses the HSMS II data on absenteeism of students and shows that having&#13;
school administrators with 10 years experience or less, teachers who use innovative teaching methods,&#13;
and schools which offer remedial classes reduces the extent of absenteeism by students in Grade 1. In&#13;
addition, the availability of textbooks, and the presence of a guidance counselor lowers the likelihood of&#13;
absenteeism among Grade 4 students. Evidence from Vietnam  , where enrollment rates are also very&#13;
high, and 20% of children do not complete primary school, shows that school quality as proxied by the&#13;
lack of supplies, poor quality building and poor quality teachers significantly lowers the probability of&#13;
completion of primary school, and a higher percentage of trained teachers significantly increases the&#13;
probability of primary school completion. Evidence from Indonesia (see Mason, 1994)12 also shows that&#13;
the lower the quality of the school, as proxied by a high ratio of broken down classrooms to maintained&#13;
classrooms, the lower the probability of completion of primary school.&#13;
17.    Pre-school Programs. There is strong evidence for the Philippines (Mingat and Tan, 1995)13&#13;
that participation in pre-school programs reduces the probability that the child will drop out of&#13;
elemeniary school, and children from the poorest families and the children of farmers are most likely to&#13;
drop out. Simulations from the model show that pre-school education reduces the disparity in drop out&#13;
behavior across wealth groups.&#13;
18.    Rates of return to primary schooling. Estimates from Psacharapolous (1994)14 show that the&#13;
private rates of return to schooling in 1988 are highest for primary schooling at 18.3%, and the estimated&#13;
social rates of return to schooling are 13.3%.&#13;
19.    Summary and Conclusions. The evidence reviewed shows that improving the quality of&#13;
education could improve primary school completion rates (and achievement test scores, as we show in&#13;
the next section). In addition, there is also some evidence that the high costs of schooling and&#13;
inaccessibility of the school are real constraints for poor children in particular, and that the children in&#13;
the older grades have to travel longer distances to attend school. The project will focus on improving the&#13;
access to quality education for the poor. There is, however, a realization that providing schools does not&#13;
guarantee enrollment. There are "hard to reach" pockets of the population even with an expanded and&#13;
improved primary school system. The improved quality of schools will increase the benefits to attending&#13;
school, and improved access will reduce some of the costs of attending school. A study is proposed as&#13;

part of the TEEP to pilot demand side financing interventions, which are mechanisms designed to&#13;
increase school participation by reducing the direct and indirect costs of schooling, to make education&#13;
affordable for the poor. The next section focuses on some of the alternatives that were considered in the&#13;
design of the project.&#13;
B. ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES&#13;
Choice of Target Group&#13;
20.    Geographic Targeting. The project will use geographic targeting as the first stage screening&#13;
device to reach the poor. The project will focus on 26 provinces. These include the 20 provinces&#13;
selected by the Government under its Social Reform Agenda for extensive targeted support. In addition,&#13;
it includes six other intensely poor provinces, identified as those with the largest contribution to national&#13;
poverty, and the highest depth of poverty. Figures 1 and 2 referred to in Section A, highlight the project&#13;
provinces. As the graphs show, the majority of the TEEP provinces are in the south-west quadrant of the&#13;
diagram indicating that they have both low incomes and low educational indicators. The TEEP&#13;
provinces' have a population of 11.55 million people, of which 7.3 million are poor. Figure 5 shows&#13;
that the TEEP provinces have a higher incidence, depth and severity of poverty than non-TEEP provinces&#13;
and contribute about 23% of the population of the national poor. The share of these provinces in the&#13;
population of the country is about 17%. There are about 2.1 million children of primary school age (6-12&#13;
years of age) in these provinces, as estimated from the 1994 FIES, of which 72% live in poor households.&#13;
The TEEP provinces have about 19% of the population of children in the age group 6-12 years.16&#13;

City, Cotabato City and Zamboanga City are excluded from the TEEP provinces.&#13;
16  Tabulations from DECS of the school age population show that 17.2% of the 7-12 year old school age&#13;
population is in the 26 provinces in the 1994-95 school year. These estimates also show that there are 1.65&#13;
million children 7-12 years old in these provinces.&#13;

21.    Targeting of Schools. Schools which do not offer the complete set of grades 1 to 6, will be&#13;
targeted to ensure that they offer all Grades 1-6. The rationale for this strategy is based on the relatively&#13;
high drop out rates found in Grade 4. Anecdotal evidence and field visits suggest that a main cause of&#13;
this drop out rate is the need to travel greater distances to a central school which offers the higher grades&#13;
(Grades 5 and 6). This strategy is designed to improve the access to a complete school for the&#13;
households in these provinces. In addition, a School Improvement and Innovation Fund (SIIF) will give&#13;
schools the opportunity to diagnose its problems, plan and implement corrective actions and evaluate the&#13;
impact. Schools are classified into three risk groups (low, medium and high) based on five criteria (see&#13;
Chapter 9 in the Technical Volume). The SIIF will target a higher proportion of its resources to schools&#13;
that are classified high (45% of resources) or medium risk (45% of resources).&#13;
22.    Household/community based targeting. The demand-side financing pilot will test different&#13;
strategies such as scholarships to cover the direct and indirect costs of schooling, vouchers to cover&#13;
tuition that are given to poor students for use in the school of their choice (including private schools),&#13;
and vouchers given to communities to build schools in communities where none exist. The pilot will&#13;
select poor rural communities for testing the interventions. In addition, within each community income-&#13;
based selection criteria may be used for targeting households.&#13;
Choice of Technology&#13;
23.    Choice of School Inputs to Improve Achievement Test Scores. The project will provide&#13;
textbooks, workbooks and instructional materials, as they have a demonstrated impact on learning&#13;
achievements in the Philippines. One set of textbooks will be provided for every two students.&#13;
Classroom furniture (more generally a proxy for adequate school facilities) has a strong demonstrated&#13;
impact on learning achievements in the Philippines.17 The project will finance repairs and rehabilitation&#13;
of school buildings, construction of toilets, and purchase of classroom furniture. There is no intervention&#13;
to improve the student teacher ratio as this has been shown to have no significant impact on achievement&#13;
test scores. International evidence corroborates this: Past studies have shown that learning improves&#13;
when the class size drops from 20 to 5, but that learning achievements are not significantly increased&#13;
when the class size falls from 40 to 20.&#13;
24.    Determinants of Learning Achievement in the Philippines. Tan, Lane and Coustere (1996)18&#13;
analyze the 1990/91 Household and Matching School II dataset, to assess the Lost-effectiveness of&#13;
alternative instruments to improve student learning. These results are used to inform the design of this&#13;
project. As a first step, the authors apply a production function approach to examine the effects of&#13;
alternative interventions on learning achievements in Grade 1. The available data permit evaluation of&#13;
the effect of workbooks, classroom furniture, class size, teacher qualifications and pre-school education.&#13;
The regression model estimated controls for variation in student's initial level of learning, student&#13;
characteristics, family background characteristics, as well as differences in classroom and school&#13;
management practices. The availability of workbooks and the adequacy of classroom furniture as&#13;
17  This finding is also consistent with evidence for other developing countries. See Eric A. Hanushek, 1995,&#13;

reported by the teacher consistently increases achievements in both Mathematics and Filipino. The&#13;
difference in the test scores of pupils with and without workbooks ranges between 0.17 and 0.22 of a&#13;
standard deviation in the two subjects.  Students in classrooms without adequate furniture have&#13;
significantly lower test scores in the two subjects (the scores are lower by between 0.28 and 0.34 of a&#13;
standard deviation). The results also show that the teacher's academic credentials, teachers experience&#13;
and class size have little effect on student's achievement scores, and hence can be ruled out as priorities&#13;
for policy intervention. The teacher's subject knowledge increases a student's achievement score in&#13;
Filipino by about 0.12 of a standard deviation. The analysis also explores the effects of management&#13;
practices on student achievement. The results are generally inconclusive, but this may reflect the&#13;
difficulty of quantitatively capturing these influences, rather that its absence in reality. There may be&#13;
additional influences, such as strong leadership in the school, emphasis on student learning, the role of&#13;
incentives (such as pay structures, promotion criterion etc.), the ties between the school and the local&#13;
community, financial and managerial autonomy of the school, accountability etc. The data do not permit&#13;
investigation of these issues. Using another dataset for the Philippines, Jimenez and Paqueo (1996)19&#13;
find that student achievement scores are higher in schools which depend on local financing. One&#13;
possible explanation of this effect is that such schools face greater incentives to respond to the needs of&#13;
the community.&#13;
25.    Comparing the Cost-Effectiveness of School Inputs on Learning Achievements. After&#13;
establishing the relationship between the school inputs and student achievement, Tan, Lane and Coustere&#13;
(1996) compare the cost effectiveness of the three effective school inputs (workbooks, classroom&#13;
furniture, and preschool programs), identified as significantly improving learning achievements. They&#13;
compute a cost-effectiveness ratio for each input, computed as the achievement impact divided by the&#13;
corresponding cost of the input (see Table 1). Data limitations precluded firm conclusions regarding the&#13;
effect on achievement of textbooks, in-service teacher training, and the Program for Comprehensive&#13;
Elementary Education Development (PRORED) supplied reference materials. Hence, it was not possible&#13;
to estimate the cost-effectiveness of these inputs. Based on this analysis, spending money on workbooks&#13;
and classroom furniture gives the best payoffs in elementary education in the Philippines, and hence&#13;
should be considered the investment priorities in elementary education. The paper also compares the&#13;
results of their analysis to earlier estimates by Heyneman et al20 on the impact of textbooks on&#13;
achievement among Filipino students. The Heyneman et al. study showed that the impact of textbooks&#13;
improved first graders achievement test scores by .30 of a standard deviation in Mathematics and 0.32 of&#13;
a standard deviation in Filipino. The results also demonstrated that a student:textbook ratio of 2:1 was as&#13;
effective as a 1: I ratio. Assuming that these ratios have been stable over time, and the costs of textbooks&#13;
are about th- same as workbooks (between 20-49 pesos each), the implied cost-effectiveness ratio would&#13;
be 12.0 to 30.0 for Mathematics, and 13.0 to 32.0 for Filipino. These results are consistent with&#13;
international experience (Hanushek, 1995).&#13;

26.    Pre-school programs are much less cost-effective, reflecting the higher unit costs of the program&#13;
and the smaller effect on achievement. However, it should be recognized that investments in textbooks,&#13;
workbooks and classroom furniture reach diminishing returns once students have these inputs. So, there&#13;
may still be a role for pre-school programs. But in areas where schools lack the basic ingredients (books,&#13;
tables and chairs) for effective teaching and learning, these are priority investments.&#13;
Choice of Mono-grade versus Multi-grade&#13;
27.    The project is promoting multi-grade teaching in small rural schools instead of the norm of&#13;
monograde teaching. The cost savings that result from this choice can be calculated by comparing the&#13;
savings in the number of teachers and classrooms that would result from this policy. The baseline&#13;
assumption is that the student teacher ratio and the student to classroom ratio would remain unchanged&#13;
from their current levels in each of the provinces. Then, the with project scenario assumes that the&#13;
student teacher ratio and the student/classroom ratio would be improved by 50% from their initial values.&#13;
The assumption is that the optimal target is 40 for both ratios. The change in the student/teacher ratio&#13;
and the student/classroom ratio is largely due to the adoption of multi-grade teaching, and we estimate&#13;
that eighty percent of these savings can be attributed to this intervention. Using these assumptions, the&#13;
estimated savings due to multi-grade teaching are that 4618 fewer teachers and 607 less classrooms will&#13;
be required.&#13;
Choice of Public Versus Private Provision&#13;
28.    All project inputs provided in the TEEP will be delivered through the public schools.&#13;
Elementary education in the Philippines is largely in the public domain. The public share of enrollments&#13;
in elementary education was 95.7% in 1980-81 and has decreased only slightly to about 92.4% in 1994-&#13;
95. Hence, it would not be unreasonable to infer that public education is largely the only option&#13;
available to the poor. The ratio of private sector enrollment to that of the public sector in elementary&#13;
education in the six provinces where the project is being introduced in the first phase ranges from less&#13;
than 1% to a maximum of 7% in Benget. Given the small share of the private sector in these regions, the&#13;
crowding out of the private sector as a consequence of the increased provision of public elementary&#13;
schooling is most likely to be minimal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -                                   Annex 2&#13;
Choice of Public Versus Private Financing&#13;
29.    All project inputs provided through the TEEP will be paid for by the public budget. Government&#13;
policy on elementary education essentially states that the state will establish and maintain a system of&#13;
free public elementary education. Hence, the public sector will continue to subsidize primary education&#13;
heavily in the Philippines. Substantial investments in improving the quality of primary education in the&#13;
selected provinces will be undertaken: such as the provision of textbooks and workbooks, teacher&#13;
training, instructional materials, classroom kits, the provision of furniture, the rehabilitation and repair of&#13;
classrooms. In addition, access to complete schools will be improved through the construction of&#13;
schools and/or classrooms, in line with the needs identified with the project.&#13;
30.   Are there any reasons why the government should subsidize primary education? The rationale&#13;
for public investment in this project is on efficiency grounds: the externalities associated with education&#13;
and imperfect information on the part of individuals, and on equity grounds (poverty reduction). (This&#13;
section draws heavily on Jimenez, King and Tan, 1996)21. There are externalities associated with basic&#13;
education because the benefits of education accrue not just to the student, but also to society. A more&#13;
educated workforce expands the economy's production possibility frontier by encouraging innovation&#13;
and the discovery of new technologies. The beneficial effects of education in reducing fertility and&#13;
population growth have been widely documented. The benefits of basic literacy in strengthening&#13;
national cohesiveness and crime reduction are also considered externalities (see Haveman and Wolfe,&#13;
1984 for a discussion of the benefits of education).  These externalities are hard to quantify, but it&#13;
implies that without the subsidized provision of primary schooling, provision will be less than socially&#13;
optimum. Another argument for public sector involvement in basic education is that parents and students&#13;
have imperfect information about the benefits of education, and hence are likely to underinvest in&#13;
education. Besides the efficiency grounds for public investment in basic education, poverty reduction&#13;
also justifies government intervention in this case. Elementary education completion is more equitably&#13;
distributed across the population than secondary education, and tertiary education, which is skewed to&#13;
the richer groups. Hence, improving the access of the poor to quality education is an important part of&#13;
the poverty alleviation strategy in the Philippines. (see Poverty Report, World Bank, 1996) The&#13;
government currently subsidizes primary education to a large extent, but the private contributions are&#13;
increasing. Estimates of the cost-sharing in public education in the Philippines and its evolution over&#13;
time are shown in Table 2. The unit recurrent costs (as shown in Table 2) include the operating costs of&#13;
schools, ii) direct private costs other than school fees (transportation, books and pedagogical supplies,&#13;
etc.) and iii) the cost of DECS' sector management and operational support (curriculum development,&#13;
student examinations, school inspection etc.) serving both public and private schools. The direct private&#13;
costs, as defined here, exclude the cost of school uniforms, meals and boarding, as well as the&#13;
opportunity cost of the student's foregone earnings. Government contributions to unit cost financing&#13;
have increased by 40% in elementary education from 1986 to 1994, but parental contributions have&#13;
increased five-fold. Most of the increase in the direct costs have been in the form of direct costs other&#13;
than school based fees.&#13;

C. FISCAL IMPACT/COST RECOVERY&#13;
Unit Costs With and Without the Project&#13;
31.    The substantial investments in improving the access and quality of public elementary education&#13;
provided in the TEEP provinces will substantially increase the recurrent unit costs of providing&#13;
elementary education. The current best estimate of the unit costs of elementary education in 1994 is&#13;
Peso 4085, of which the public sector contributes 69.1% (see Table 2). The comparison between 1994&#13;
and 2003 is inherently problematic, as the unit costs for 1994 include DECS' overhead too (see previous&#13;
section). In addition, the cost estimates for 1997 and 2003 are likely to underestimate the true operating&#13;
costs. Personnel services for instance, includes the costs of all teachers, school principals and district&#13;
supervisors to the extent feasible. Yet the costs of personnel for district offices etc. are not included.&#13;
Similar caveats apply to maintenance and operating expenditures. With these caveats in mind, we&#13;
estimate that the project will require that the public sector increase its financing of expenditure allocated&#13;
to personnel services and MOOE by 30-40% in real terms for providing elementary education in these&#13;
provinces. The project is also reducing the need for teachers by encouraging multi-grade teaching. The&#13;
real costs of personal services stay almost constant, but the MOOE expenditures increase by almost&#13;
220% over the period 1997 to 2003.&#13;

32.   The government will bear the costs of the interventions proposed in the project, and impose no&#13;
additional cost recovery from the students for the inputs supplied toward improving quality. The project&#13;
will in fact reduce the costs of a "quality adjusted schooling" for school going children through an&#13;
increased availability of textbooks, a decrease in the distance to a complete school, and better trained&#13;
teachers. Private contributions to augment public school budgets through donations, or the purchase of&#13;
school inputs, such as textbooks and supplies, as well as transportation costs to better schools which are&#13;
further away, should be lowered from its current level of 30% as adequate school inputs are provided in&#13;
public schools, and complete schools are provided closer to home.&#13;
33.   Can the Government Afford it? The key question is: Can the Philippine government (GoP)&#13;
finance the activities under the project and continue undertak-ing them in a sustained manner beyond the&#13;
life of the project? At present education is primarily a Central Government expenditure responsibility.&#13;
Education accounts for a relatively high share of the annual national government budget (26%), and the&#13;
government is expected to continue to maintain this share. However, within the education budget, there&#13;
has been a decline in the share of elementary education from its peak of 60% in 1987 to around 54% in&#13;
1993. Local governments (LGUs) have been active in financing education, with the average share of the&#13;
LGUs increasing from 2% in 1990 to about 7% in 1993. The school building program component of the&#13;
overall education budget will be partially devolved to the local governments in 1997. The ability of the&#13;
GoP to finance the project was analyzed by comparing the projected government budget allocated to&#13;
elementary education to the projected subsidy associated with delivering elementary education in the&#13;
TEEP provinces during the project life.  These comparisons identified the annual financing&#13;
deficits/surpluses within each budget category. The current government budget was projected to 2003&#13;
using the growth rates of government consumption expenditure from the CAS and the capital account of&#13;
the budget was projected using the growth rates of government investment. The budgets were projected&#13;
in three different categories: personnel services, maintenance and operating expenditures (MOOE) and&#13;
capital expenditures. According to the Memorandum of Policy, the share of the education budget&#13;
allocated to elementary education will increase from its current level to 60% in the year 2001 and stay&#13;
constant thereafter. This assumption is built into the projections of the GoP's budget constraint. Three&#13;
alternate scenarios for projecting the government budget constraint are analyzed in paras. 4.35-4.40 of&#13;
the SAR, and the results are summarized in Table 4.&#13;

D. COST EFFECTIVENESS/COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS&#13;
Measurement of Effectiveness&#13;
34.   Primary School Completion Rate. In the absence of a good study on the determinants of&#13;
primary school completion for the Philippines, projecting the impact of the interventions of the TEEP on&#13;
the flow of students is tentative at best. We use the evidence at hand from studies in Indonesia and&#13;
Vietnam to illustrate the range of impacts. The package of interventions on improving quality that we&#13;
can hypothesize an impact for are: lack of supplies (interpreted as an inadequacy of textbooks,&#13;
instructional materials), the availability of good teachers, and the quality of buildings (based on results&#13;
from Vietnam and Indonesia to a limited extent). The project will also improve access by providing&#13;
complete schools within an hours walk, and the effect on primary school completion rates can be&#13;
illustrated with results from Indonesia.&#13;
35.    Mason (1994) shows the impact of improving the "school quality" and other policy interventions&#13;
on the primary school to lower secondary school transition probabilities in rural Java. Eliminating&#13;
school fees and material costs have a large effect on the transition rate from primary to secondary school&#13;
of the poor in rural Java. School quality, as proxied by the ratio of broken-down to maintained&#13;
classrooms, is a proxy in this study for the recurrent expenditure on schools. More refined measures of&#13;
school quality, such as the availability of textbooks, study materials, or teacher quality are unavailable.&#13;
Mason argues that the price of going to school includes some measure of quality which is hard to&#13;
disentangle. Hence, the true effect of school quality, is probably higher than that estimated in this study.&#13;
In addition, King (1995) studies the determinants of transition from primary to secondary school for all&#13;
of Indonesia (not just rural Java). The results for all of Indonesia show similar trends, but a higher&#13;
degree of responsiveness to changes in school fees and other direct costs than those found for Java.&#13;
Table 5 shows the effects of four different pricing simulations on the transition probabilities of entry into&#13;
primary school, and the transition to lower secondary school for the poor in Indonesia in 1989. The&#13;
results show that a reduction in the price of schooling will increase the rate at which children from poor&#13;
households enter school, and continue on to higher levels. The pricing reform simulations focus on their&#13;
effect on increasing the enrollment rate of the poorest quintile, and comparing the simulated effect for&#13;
that quintile with the enrollment rates of the middle quintile. The transition probability of primary to&#13;
lower secondary school increases by 67% for the poor if they are given an augmented subsidy that&#13;
reflects the opportunity cost of school attendance and out of pocket expenditures for school. Reducing&#13;
the distance to school to within I km. raises the probability of transition from primary to lower&#13;
secondary school from 0.46 to 0.53, an increase of about 14%. A study in Vietnam (Glewwe and Jacoby,&#13;
1995) examines the determinants of enrollment in primary school and primary school completion. The&#13;
analysis includes the effects of some primary school quality variables. These include the percentage of&#13;
teachers trained, the lack of supplies, the availability of good teachers, and the poor quality of the&#13;
building, and all of them have a significant impact on the probability of completing primary school. We&#13;
simulate the effects of a 25%, 50% and 90% improvement in the three school quality variables (the lack&#13;
of supplies, poor quality building, and poor quality teachers) at different initial levels of primary school&#13;
completion. The other explanatory variables are held constant (at the mean values of the explanatory&#13;
variables).&#13;

36.    The primary school completion rates in the TEEP provinces range from 30% to 80% with a mean&#13;
of 55%. The effects of the three scenarios is presented below. Scenario 2 was picked as the likely&#13;
expected impact of the project, after discussions with the Department of Education, Culture and Sports&#13;
staff. The impact of the school quality variables may be somewhat optimistic in Scenario 2, and the true&#13;
impact will likely be a range of estimates between those of Scenarios I and 2. It should be recognized&#13;
that there are many interventions (such as the decentralization, and giving schools more autonomy)&#13;
which are likely to impact on schooling outcomes, but whose effects are difficult to quantify. A study&#13;
will be put in place in the first year to better understand the determinants of primary school completion,&#13;
and this study will be used to refine the current estimates.&#13;

PHILIPPINES&#13;
THIRD ELEMENTARY EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT PERFORMANCE INDICATORS&#13;
1.    The TEEP is a set of inputs (textbooks, equipment, civil works, specialist services)&#13;
designed to allow a particular set - of activities (policy and institutional change, in-service&#13;
training) to be undertaken to achieve a number of outcomes (increased effectiveness and&#13;
efficiency, more equitable access to quality education, improved learning achievements, reduced&#13;
drop-outs...) leading to beneficial impacts on education (a more literate and numerate work force,&#13;
better informed citizenry, more social cohesion...).&#13;
2.    Performance indicators are designed to answer four basic questions:&#13;
(a)   For inputs: were the resources adequate, available on time, and cost-conscious?&#13;
(b)   For project activities: were the activities completed on time, cost-effectively, to&#13;
expected quality standards?&#13;
(c)   For outputs and outcomes: have the activities led to results, are those results the&#13;
initially agreed outcomes, have they benefited the intended target group?&#13;
(d)   For impact: did all of this lead to improvements in children learning, completion&#13;
rates, enrollments, project sustainability?&#13;
3.    Table 5.1 shows which type of indicators have been selected for each of the two project&#13;
components. Table 5.2 provides the baseline and quantified targets. Table 5.3 explains how the&#13;
indicators will be monitored and when. Table 5.4 presents the project's monitoring and&#13;
evaluation strategy. The following paragraphs provide additional information on the indicators.&#13;
Given that the number of indicators is limited to 11, a conscious decision has been made not to&#13;
include in the list the indicators routinely monitored in the Quarterly Progress Reports of the&#13;
Implementing Agency: disbursements, procurement, number of teachers trained but rather, to&#13;
complement them.&#13;
Extent to which Policy Decisions are Based on Data and Analysis&#13;
4.    This is one of two non quantified indicators. Obviously policy and investment decisions&#13;
will always have to reflect political considerations, but the issue is one of balance. Two cases in&#13;
point are (a) the decision whether to add an 11th year to the 10-year basic education cycle and&#13;
where in the cycle; and (b) frequent statements about the order of magnitude of teacher&#13;
shortages, which seem to be seriously overstated due to unreliable data. Decisions made to&#13;
address the perceived teacher shortage will be incremental and can be corrected; on the other&#13;
hand, the decision regarding the 11th year, once taken, will have major consequences and will be&#13;
difficult to reverse. The monitoring of this indicator will be a content analysis of decision&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -                              Annx 5&#13;
rationales. It will be used as an opportunity to maintain a fruitful dialogue on the project&#13;
research agenda.&#13;
Timeliness and Accuracy of Statistical Yearbooks&#13;
5.    Although it has the capacity, DECS does not publish a Statistical Yearbook on a regular&#13;
and predictable basis. Sophisticated analysis and even relatively simple operations such as&#13;
cohort analysis are difficult to perform and the results lack credibility because of the low quality&#13;
of the data. This issue is also the cause of major planning problems. The MIS component will&#13;
help DECS improve the quality of the data by simplifying the requirements on the schools and&#13;
providing training to all TEEP stakeholders on the collection, value and use of statistics.&#13;
Monitoring the timeliness of the statistical book (four months after the beginning of the SY) is an&#13;
easy and objective indicator. Monitoring the quality of the data will require a validity study&#13;
which could be funded under the research component. Adequate attention to this issue is&#13;
fundamental to improving and modernizing the management of the sector.&#13;
Gap between Planned and Actual Expenditures&#13;
6.    Expenditures: Multiple changes in budget format and nomenclature make it difficult to&#13;
observe relevant indicators over a period of time. In addition, the recording of actual expenditure&#13;
commitment does not match the detailed format of initial budget appropriations. This makes it&#13;
difficult to monitor the actual implementation of specific budget programs and objectives. The&#13;
following will be monitored:&#13;
(a)   In PY1:  Revision of the budget presentation (as recommended in Public&#13;
Expenditure Review)&#13;
(b)   Every PY: The pattern of actual versus budgeted expenditures. Baseline: during&#13;
1991-93, underspending averaged 6 percent of DECS total budget allocation.&#13;
Target: By the end of the project, no more than a 5 percent gap between net&#13;
disbursables and actual expenditures, taking into account the school year within&#13;
which it is allowed to disburse. Monitoring will be limited to TEEP provinces.&#13;
Institutionalization of In-service Training (INSET)&#13;
7.    This indicator will be measured by the following items: (a) formalization of an INSET&#13;
policy statement and Plan of Action; (b) full development of INSET Guidelines; (c) full&#13;
deployment of INSET support structure; (d) adequate INSET budget; (e) on-going monitoring of&#13;
INSET program, with a focus on substance (is teacher behavior changing? for instance, during&#13;
classes, is the proportion of time spent by the teacher lecturing as opposed to actively engaging&#13;
the pupils declining?), not just process (number of teachers trained); and (f) integration of&#13;
distance education into INSET Plan of Action. Elements (a) through (e) should be in place&#13;
before project effectiveness, but are expected to be refined from year-to-year in light of&#13;
experience as new batches of provinces are coming on stream. Element (e) will require special&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

studies, to be funded under the research component, and (f) is unlikely to be operationalized until&#13;
PY3. This is closely linked to the next indicator.&#13;
Level of Resources Flowing Directly to Schools&#13;
8.    Resources will flow directly to schools under two schemes:&#13;
(a)   two DECS orders dated March 22, 1996 which direct the transfer of GAA funds&#13;
for school construction, desks, INSET and MOOE to the Divisions and, where&#13;
possible, the schools themselves.&#13;
(b)   The School Improvement and Innovation Facility (SIIF).&#13;
TEEP will monitor: (i) operationalization and implementation of the two DECS Orders;&#13;
and (ii) the award of grants to schools as follows:&#13;
Number of Grants:&#13;
Category of School         97    98    99    20    01   02   03   Total&#13;
High Risk (45% of Grants)         45   135   225   360                765&#13;
Medium Risk(45% of Grants)        45   135   225   360                765&#13;
Low Risk (10% of Grants)          10   30    50    80                 170&#13;
Total                            100   300   500   800               1,700&#13;
In addition to those mechanistic indicators, spot-checks conducted by NGOs in the context of the&#13;
annual participatory performance audit will monitor the qualitative impact of these grants and&#13;
more generally pedagogic improvements at the school level (five percent of the total). They will&#13;
monitor: (a) the frequency, purpose and outcome of meetings or other forms of interaction&#13;
between the school and the community (PTAs, LGUs, other) , for which schools will be asked to&#13;
keep a simple record; (b) at the school level, changes in the nature and impact of contacts&#13;
between the supervisor, principal and teachers (also to be recorded succinctly in a school diary);&#13;
and (c) the number of school management advisory committees functioning after three years.&#13;
Central/Local Government Cost-sharing as a Targeting Mechanism&#13;
9.    The formula, to be based on ability-to-pay {own revenues+IRA/population}, equity&#13;
[headcount index] and need [completion rate], will be presented at negotiations. The project will&#13;
monitor the share of total education expenditures, by category (capital, personnel, MOOE) going&#13;
to the 26 provinces, both as a group and individually, relative to their population. Baseline: (to&#13;
be refined by negotiations) the 26 provinces account for 20 percent of the country's school-age&#13;
population, and 24 percent of the poor, yet they only receive 16.7 percent of resources. Target:&#13;
at a minimum, beginning in PY2, (Philippine FY1998) the TEEP provinces should receive no&#13;
less than 20 percent of total appropriations for elementary education. This should be adequate to&#13;
ensure project sustainability but for real targeting should gradually be further increased.&#13;
Underlying this, TEEP will also assist DECS in monitoring the Memorandum of Policy&#13;
commitment to maintain the share of education in the national budget (excluding debt payment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-73 -                               Annex 5&#13;
and IRA) at 26 percent, and to increase the share of elementary education from 47 percent&#13;
(present) to 60 percent by 2001.&#13;
Textbook:pupil ratio in Remote Schools&#13;
10.   Baseline: The textbook:pupil ratio in the six pilot provinces ranges from 1:3 in Benguet&#13;
to 1:6 in Antique, Agusan and Surigao. There are no full sets of books at the moment. Target:&#13;
DECS is committed to providing one set of four books for every two pupils and one set of three&#13;
workbooks for every multigrade child, by the beginning of SY97-98. The criteria for DEDP&#13;
approval will include the spelling out of a divisional strategy for ensuring that, once the books&#13;
are delivered to the district level, community arrangements are set-up to ensure that they are&#13;
transported to the schools. Bank missions will monitor the budget allocation for textbooks and&#13;
instructional materials and the annual performance audit will conduct spot-checks in remote&#13;
schools to verify availability.&#13;
Pupils Scores in English, Mathematics and Science&#13;
11.   Baseline: The achievement rates are presented in Annex 4, Table 2.&#13;
Target: a 20 percent increase by the end of the project. Initial NEAT scores will be statistically&#13;
equated with a new instrument to be used in PY2, PY4 and PY6 to monitor impact on a sample&#13;
basis.&#13;
Completion Rates through Grade VI&#13;
12.   Baseline: At present, in the TEEP provinces the completion rates range from 30 to 80&#13;
percent and average 55 percent. Target: the list presented in Annex 2, Table 6 shows, under two&#13;
scenarios, the potential impact, on completion rates, of a package of three interventions -- teacher&#13;
in-service training, school buildings, and instructional material. The impact was estimated on the&#13;
basis of (a) three Bank studies on the cost-effectiveness of different educational inputs on&#13;
elementary completion in the Philippines; and (b) where Philippines-specific studies were not&#13;
available, on comparable analyses conducted in Vietnam and Indonesia. Scenarios 2 and 3&#13;
reflect respectively 50 and 90 percent of the potential impact of the three sets of inputs (scenario&#13;
1, reflecting a conservative 25 percent of the potential impact, was not fully elaborated). TEEP's&#13;
evaluation studies will improve the coverage and quality of the school-level data available in the&#13;
country. The indicators will be monitored by province.&#13;
Percentage of Children Less Than One Hour's Walk from School&#13;
13.   Baseline: The table below summarizes the nationwide situation expressed in time rather&#13;
than Kilometers to reflect variations of terrain. The indicator will be specified by province,&#13;
based on the detailed school-map.&#13;

Target: 95 percent of the 6-12 year olds will be less than one hour's walk from school by the end of the&#13;
project.&#13;
Participation&#13;
14.   Participation lies at the core of TEEP preparation and implementation, based on the&#13;
assumption that stakeholder involvement will lead to improvements in the quality of education.&#13;
Baseline: until now, parents and communities have never been consulted. Target: stakeholders&#13;
must be satisfied that they have been consulted during preparation of their DEDPs, and, during&#13;
implementation, that their needs are being addressed. The method to be used are the yearly&#13;
participatory audit mentioned in para. 8. Stakeholders are defined as DECS personnel at all&#13;
levels, school boards and school management advisory committees, parents and LGUs, with&#13;
special attention to ethnic communities.&#13;

MEMORANDUM OF POLICY&#13;
June 30. 1996&#13;
MEMORANDUM&#13;
FOR    : THE SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE OF NEDA&#13;
FROM : THE SECRETARY OF EDUCATION, CULTURE AND SPORTS&#13;
SUBJECT: PROPOSED POLICIES GOVERNING PUBLIC INVESTMENTS&#13;
IN ELEMENTARY EDUCATION&#13;
The Department of Education, Culture and Sports is proposing an investment in the total&#13;
amount of $ 586.2M under the Third Elementary Education Project (TEEP). The total&#13;
project expenditure is proposed to be incurred over a period of 7 years starting 1996 (on&#13;
retroactive financing basis) until the year 2003. The details of the project description, its&#13;
costing, financing plan and implementation arrangements are contained in a separate set of&#13;
project documents already submitted to the Investment Coordinating Committee.&#13;
The purpose of this memorandum is to present, for favorable SDC endorsement and&#13;
eventual NEDA Board approval, the general policies proposed to govern investments in&#13;
TEEP as well as in other public investment projects in elementary education. These&#13;
policies are essential for the effective and sustainable implementation of TEEP. In addition&#13;
to facilitating this particular project, these policies will also set the critical parameters for&#13;
much of the technical and managerial work needed to improve public elementary education&#13;
which should be undertaken by the DECS as wel as other cooperating govemrnment&#13;
agencies, such as DBM, DOF, DPWH, the local governments, among others.&#13;
The Department of Education, Culture and Sports seeks the favorable endorsement of the&#13;
SDC of these proposed policies and the eventual approval by the NEDA Board in order to&#13;
enswe that these policies govern not only the work of DECS but also the related work of&#13;
the rest of govmnment.&#13;
Broad Legal Basis of Government on Elementary Education&#13;
Government policy on elementary education is fundamentally governed by the following&#13;
specific provisions of the 1987 Constitution:&#13;
"the State shall protect and promote the right of all citizens to quality&#13;
education at all kvels and shall take appropriate steps to make education&#13;
accessible to all."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81 -                          Annex 7&#13;
*  the State shall, among others, "establish, maintain and support a complete,&#13;
adequate, and integrated system of education relevant to the needs of the&#13;
people and society; and establish and maintain a system of free public&#13;
education in the elementary and high schools levels. "&#13;
* all educational institutions shall "inculcate patriotism and nationalism, foster&#13;
love of humanity, respect for human rights, appreciation of the role of heroes&#13;
in the historical development of the country, teach the rights and duties of&#13;
citizenship, strengthen ethical and spiritual values, develop moral character&#13;
and personal discipline, encourage critical and creative thinking, broaden&#13;
scientific and technological knowledge, and promote vocational efficiency. "&#13;
The legislation governing the current operation of the Department of Education, Culture&#13;
and Sports, Executive Order No. 117, a law undcr the Freedom Constitution that&#13;
reorganized the DECS, declares the State policy that:&#13;
"the educational system shall make maximum contribution to the attainment of&#13;
national development goals; the State shall promote and maintain equality of&#13;
access to education and enjoyment of the benefits thereof by all citizens; and the&#13;
State shall use education as an instrument for the development of the cultural&#13;
communities of the nation and the deprived communities to enrich their&#13;
participation in the community and national life and to unify all Filipinos into a&#13;
free andjust nation. "&#13;
Substantive Directions Under the Ramos Administration&#13;
These general Constitutional and legislative have been translated into specific substantive&#13;
executive directions under the adninisirton of President Fidel V. Ramos. The current&#13;
Medium Tern Philippine Development Plan directs education to contribute to people&#13;
empowerment and world competitiveness. The government's Masterplan for Basic&#13;
Education further defines the goal of quality education as the development of people who&#13;
"believe in God love the country and people, proud of being Filipino with its&#13;
culture and history, committed to conserving and developing the nation's&#13;
resources, possesses indigenous and international values, proficient in Filipino&#13;
and English, creative and critical thinkers who are lifelong learners, and capable&#13;
of coping with changes in the environment and with competition."&#13;
For elementary and secondary education levels, this broad goal has been defined by the&#13;
same Masterplan as balanced development of the Filipno child in terms of:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -                          Annex 7&#13;
"literacy and numeracy, character formation and physical development, mastery&#13;
offundamental learning skills and preparation for tertiary studies or the world&#13;
of work "&#13;
In terms of the intended curriculum  for elementary education, these specific child&#13;
development goals have been expressed in terms of achieving desired competencies in core&#13;
subjects of elementary education, namely, Filipino, English, Math, Science, Social Studies&#13;
and Values Education.&#13;
Elementary education has been designed by the DECS with the intention of meeting four&#13;
specific learning objectives, namely:&#13;
1.  build basic knowledge andfoundation skills, atttudes and values essential&#13;
to personal development and social integration;&#13;
2.  provide learning experiences that increase awareness and responsiveness&#13;
essentialfor constructive and effective involvement with society;&#13;
3.  enhance love of nation and culture; and&#13;
4.  promote work experiences to prepare for hones and gainful work&#13;
Furthermore, education poicy in the Rainos Administration has explicitly recognized the&#13;
importance of education's contribution to the improvement of living standards and socio-&#13;
economic status of the disadvantaged. As stated in the Education for Al Plan:&#13;
"Basic education as an anti-poverty instrument can provide the skills, attitudes,&#13;
knowledge and values that people can use to organize themselves for common&#13;
access to useful information, and a united approach to greater productivity. It&#13;
can also empower the marginalized and prevent their exploitation and alienation&#13;
from the development process. "&#13;
Thus basic educafion, including elementary education, has been made an essential part of&#13;
the Social Reform Agenda. Public clementay education is included in the SRA both as a&#13;
sectoral intervention in the social sector, as wel as a geographically targeted intrvention in&#13;
the poorest provinces.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-83 -                               Annex 7&#13;
Priority Goals in Elementary Education&#13;
In order to satisfy these Constitutional, legislative and executive mandates, elementary&#13;
education outcomes in general have to improve. Since close to 93% of total elementary&#13;
school enrollment (or about 80% of total elementary school age population) are in public&#13;
schools, the outcomes of public elementary education, in particular, have to substantially&#13;
improve. The key outcomes of interest are interrelated: universal participation in&#13;
schooling; uninterrupted completion of 6 years of instruction; and higher levels of Icarning&#13;
achievement.&#13;
But in order to substantially, systematically and sustainably improve student outcomes from&#13;
public elementary education, two key intermediate and parallel objectives have to be both&#13;
attained in due course. The institutional capacity of DECS to manage the delvery of&#13;
effective elementary education has to be strengthened. At the same time, those critical&#13;
conditions of public elementary education delivery that have the greatest contribution to&#13;
participation, completion and achievement also have to be improved. In other words,&#13;
improved institutional capacity to manage provision of effective education has to be&#13;
achieved together with improved concrete conditions in provision of such effective&#13;
education.&#13;
Thus, the policies proposed below seek to contribute to meeting the following priority.&#13;
goals:&#13;
Primary Goal: improve student outcomes from public elementary education in&#13;
terms of participation, completion and achievement.&#13;
Corollary Goal A: improve DECS management and professional capacity for&#13;
delivering public elementary education that yields better outcomes.&#13;
Corollary Goal B: improve actual conditions for delivering public elementary&#13;
education that yields better outcomes.&#13;
Policies on Financing Public Elementary Education&#13;
1.     Finanae and Educaional Ouam   :  Government wi progressively mobilize&#13;
increasing levels of sustainable central, local and private financing necessary to achieve ever&#13;
improving educational outcomes while improving equity in access to education. At each&#13;
level of financing made available by the economy, DECS, as the primary government&#13;
agency in education delivety, shall seek to operationally obtain the best possible aggregate&#13;
student outcomes within the overall budget constraints.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84 -                               Annex 7&#13;
2.     Inter-Setoral Resource Aocation:   As education already accounts for a&#13;
relatively high 26% of the annual national government budget, government will maintain&#13;
this approximate percentage share. Absolute increases in public expenditure in education&#13;
will primarily come from increased levels of government resource mobilization.&#13;
3.     Intra-Setoral Resource AUocation: Within the annual public education budget&#13;
of the national government, total allocations for public elementary education will&#13;
progressively be increased each year in order to restore at the latest by the year 2001 the&#13;
peak 60% share of elementary education last achieved in 1987 (1995 baseline: 47%).&#13;
Thereafter this total share will be maintained over the longer term.&#13;
In order to achieve this targeted allocation within the sector, DECS will maintain a dialogue&#13;
with CHED and TESDA under the auspices of NEDA, DOF and DBM so that options for&#13;
achieving more efficient and equitable re-allocations of national govemment financing&#13;
between the basic education and tertiary education levels can be identified and&#13;
implemented.&#13;
4.     Alocafton Amonf Expenditwre Catetories: Withi the total annual budget for&#13;
pubiic elementary education sourced from national and local governments, allocations&#13;
among expenditure items wil seek, at least, to achieve progressive year to year incrcases in&#13;
real terms of the average annual MOOE per enrolled student (1994 baseline: estimated at&#13;
P125 per student per year). Furthermore, the future authorization, release and utilzation&#13;
of these increased MOOE per student will be progressively decentralized so that these&#13;
funds are managed directly at the level of the indidual schools by the year 1998 (1995&#13;
baseline: managed by the regional offices).&#13;
By using revised nonns for budgeting recurrent costs in the national budget and obtaining&#13;
increased local govemment contributions for elementary education according to proposed&#13;
policies on central-local cost sharing below, annual average real MOOE per student in the&#13;
future will be targeted towards raising the national average together with ensurng more&#13;
progressive school-to-school variations around the average.&#13;
S.      Centr-Local Cost ShwinR:  Within the total annual expenditures for public&#13;
elementary education sourced from national and local govemments, the average total share&#13;
of all local govenments nationwide wil be encouraged to further continue its increase&#13;
(baselines: 2% of total public expenditures in 1990; 7% in 1993; 9% in 1995), while&#13;
ensuring that variations among individual LGUs around the average become more&#13;
progressive in tenrs of the share of public education expenditures relative to total LGU&#13;
revenues.&#13;
The actal nationwide average share of all local governments in public financing for&#13;
elementary education in the future will emerge as the result of pursuing the following&#13;
specific initiatives:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-85 -                                Annex 7&#13;
a     Local rovernment financine  of schoolbud&amp;nf:  Average shares of local&#13;
govemments in financing the costs of schoolbuilding in their localities will be targeted&#13;
to rapidly increase each year. All schoolbuilding construction will be fully financed&#13;
by all LGUs (with a few highly meritorious exceptions) by the year 1999, the first ful&#13;
year in the administration of local officials newly elected in 1998.&#13;
b.    School MOOE finanaew by local Eovernments:   Revenue rich local&#13;
govenmments such as cities, first and second class municipalities, and first and second&#13;
class provisions will be encouraged to increase their share in financing MOOE of&#13;
schools in their localities. This will allow DECS to reduce national funding for these&#13;
better off localities without adversely affecting education quality and accordingly&#13;
increase national funding for school MOOE in poorer localities with poorer LGUs.&#13;
a     Assirnmnwt of sdected school ewenrutre ims to LGUs:  Agreements&#13;
will be negotiated with LGUs that will identify specific public elementary education&#13;
expenditure items (e.g. repair and maintenance of schoolbuildings, portion of&#13;
textbook requrements beyond the nationally financed minimum, water and electricity&#13;
supply for schools, etc.) which could regularly be borne by the budgets of various&#13;
levels of local governments.&#13;
d     Seftine educaion-oriented pnorities in the use of SEF. Administratie&#13;
regulations will sought to establish a common set of priorities govening eligibility for&#13;
financing from Special Education Funds of the LGUs. This will ensure that this&#13;
mnandatory source of LGU financing for education wil be used first for those&#13;
expenditure items with the greatest contribution to education quality, before other less&#13;
cost-effective items.&#13;
OCriteria for sein.  local cost share tds:  The setting of targets in local&#13;
cost shares in public elementary education will be governed by explicit, observable&#13;
and well-defined crteria. These criteria will be applied fairly and evenly across all&#13;
LGUs. Exceptions to the application of the criteria wM be defined clearly and thir&#13;
basis established.   Targeted expenditure shaing between central and local&#13;
govenunents will be set using formula-based and objective criteria.&#13;
The criteria shall consider the following factors: 1) national govennment financing&#13;
allocation objectives; 2) levels of desired adequacy for each category of expenditure&#13;
to be financed, assessment of needs of localities relative to desired levels of adequacy&#13;
in provisions; financial capabilty of the local govermnents; and 4) consequent&#13;
wiliness to pay behaviors of autonomous local govemments. The fornula for&#13;
cost-sharing wmi be established, tested, and revised in several iterations subject to&#13;
negotiations with local govenmuents and assessment of financing outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 86 -                               Annex 7&#13;
6.      Public-Private Cost SharinE:  Financing deemed adequate to meet the public&#13;
goals of public elementary education will primarily come from public sources, such as&#13;
national and local governments. Even as actual levels of public financing for public&#13;
elementary schools are being increased as defined by the above policies, such financing&#13;
levels may still be deemed insufficient by some parents and communities in terms of&#13;
satisfying their desired educational outcomes for their children. In response, households&#13;
and communities use private financing of elementary schooling through the folowing&#13;
practices: opting to enroll their children in private schools despite availability of places in&#13;
public schools; augmenting public school budgets by making donations and voluntary&#13;
contributions; substituting private payments for what should really be publicly financed&#13;
purchase of essential school inputs like own copies of textbooks and supplies of educational&#13;
materials; not using publicly funded schools nearby and privately spending instead to&#13;
transport their children to other public schools perceived to be of better quality.&#13;
Estimates indicate that private financing of elementary education account for as much as&#13;
36%  of total elementary education costs in 1994.  Some portion of these private&#13;
expenditures are legitimate and acceptable private financing models for meeting what are&#13;
essentially private choices.  But some portion of these household and community&#13;
expenditures may be undesirable barriers to equitable access to elementary education of&#13;
adequate quality. In particular, some private costs of providing or accessing public&#13;
elementary education may be too high relative to average incomes of the poorest&#13;
households and communities so that these advesely affect school participation and&#13;
completion of children from such households and communities.&#13;
Thus there is a need for policies to selectively reduce and more equitably re-distribute these&#13;
private costs of public education so that the poor and non-poor can all obtain elementary&#13;
education of adequate quality fully through public financing, and that, in addition, the non-&#13;
poor can opt to obtain better than adequate education by financing for themselves&#13;
supplementary prtivate expenditures cither through use of private schooling or by&#13;
augmenting the operating funds of their preferred public schools.&#13;
The following policies shall be pursued in this regard. Public and private costs in providing&#13;
adequate quality elementary education in public schools will be met by financing largely&#13;
through central and local government expenditures in accordance with  (a) below.&#13;
Additonal costs for obtaning better than adequate provisions for education in public&#13;
elementary schools as desired by local communmty consensus shall be financed by&#13;
supplementary funds derived through locally decided voluntary contributions in accordance&#13;
with (c) below. Elementary education through private schools shall remain an option for&#13;
those who prefer this alternative and can afford to pay its costs in accordance with (b)&#13;
below. Reducing the costs associated with the poorest households' uflization of public&#13;
elementary education, as distinct from the costs of makig available such education with&#13;
adequate quality, shall be an additional object of public policy as described in (d) below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -                               Annex 7&#13;
a.    Reducine the demand for Private fnancine of oublic schogene. Total&#13;
public financing from national and local govemment sources shall be raised and&#13;
targeted to attain levels of provisions, even without any private contributions or&#13;
payments, sufficient to produce adequate public educational outcomes in all cases.&#13;
The levels of combined central and local public financing for each public elementary&#13;
school should be such that the poor can obtain adequate elementary education in&#13;
public schools close to them without having to pay for or contribute to the essential&#13;
inputs of schooling. This is the fundamental financing condition for realizing the goal&#13;
of universal free public elementary education. Satisfying this financing condition&#13;
should reduce that portion of the demand in schools for private contributions due to&#13;
situations where available public funds fall short of meeting the public policy goal of&#13;
adequate quality universal public elementary education.&#13;
b.    Meetine the demand for Private choices in educaion throueh oriw e&#13;
schools. But private demand for higher educational outcomes beyond the publicly&#13;
defined levels of adequacy shall be respected, as long as public financing shall not be&#13;
used for such purpose. Meeting such demand through use of private schools is one&#13;
acceptable option. Hence, exisfing policies which encourage expansion and use of&#13;
prtivate schools financed through private means shall be maintained. Deregulating&#13;
fees and improving the regulation of quality in such private elementary schools shall&#13;
also be continued.&#13;
c.    Alowinr locailv shared roals in education to be met throueh oulic&#13;
school&amp;   In public schools, however, private demand for educational outcomes&#13;
beyond levels of adequacy set by public policy shall be selectively and carefuly met.&#13;
All available public financing should first be focused on meeting universal standards&#13;
of adequacy in public schools. Private goals in education that are localy shared may&#13;
also be met through public schools. Voluntary supplementaiy private financing of&#13;
public schools shall be the main source for meeting locally shared demands for&#13;
education quality beyond the established national standards. Parly for this purpose,&#13;
each community served by each pubiic school shall be encouraged to organize and&#13;
participate in the govemance and financing of their school.&#13;
Within locally accepted nonns and strictly according to locally defined consensus,&#13;
vohrntary prvate contnbutions to augnent the publicly financed operating budgets of&#13;
individual pubiic schools wmi be encouraged, subject to administrative regulation.&#13;
Such contributions should be mobilized only for the purpose of allowing individual&#13;
communities to secure and finance for themselves their commonly shared desires for&#13;
education provisions beyond nationally established levels of adequacy.  Local&#13;
comunmity contnbutions shal not be considered part of total public financing for&#13;
education, but shall be regarded, instead, as supplementary private financing of&#13;
schools to meet the community's own additional provisions in their own public&#13;
schools.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88-                                Annex 7&#13;
d     Reducinr the costs of school comnleton amon the Poor  In addition to&#13;
policies goveming the financing of making available to all elementay education&#13;
provisions of adequate quality, policies for reducing the private costs of elementary&#13;
school participation by the poorest shall also be developed.  The burden of&#13;
opportunity costs of child labor among the rural poor is particularly heavy in the last&#13;
3 to 4 grade levels of the child's elementary schooling. Despite adequate availability&#13;
of opportunities for completing elementary education, the school-aged children of the&#13;
poorest households may still not benefit from these provisions because the imrnediate&#13;
contribution of these children's labor to the current low incomes of the households&#13;
could effectivety discourage them from completing school, and ultimately reduce&#13;
their long term ability to contribute to future household incomes. In order to meet&#13;
this issue, experiments in public subsidies to poor households designed to encourage&#13;
them to keep their children in the intermediate grades shall be developed and&#13;
implemented during the School Years 1997 to 2000. Based on the results and&#13;
evaluation of these experiments, appropriate policies shall be formulated to reduce&#13;
the costs of elementary school completion for children of poorest households.&#13;
7.     School Focus of Public Educaion Finann.  Except for the essential costs&#13;
of education administration at central, regional and divisional levels to be largely bome by&#13;
the national government budget, all available public financing for public elementary&#13;
education, from national and local sources, wil be allocated, utiized, accounted for, and&#13;
monitored with consistent focus on their imnpact on schools, classroom processes and&#13;
situent outcomes.&#13;
Public on Education Administation&#13;
1.     School Focus of Educaton Adminisration:    The operations of public&#13;
elementary education will be progrevly re-engineered towards focusing on schools,&#13;
classoom processes, and student outcomes.  The emphasis shal increasingly be the&#13;
inplemented curriculum, rather than the intended cunicuhun. Administrative attention&#13;
shal be directed towards the folowing specific prionties: actual staff deployment for&#13;
teaching; on-hand availability of textbooks and instructional materials; prevalent teaching&#13;
practices in the classroom and as promoted through in-service teachers' traimng and&#13;
instnictional supervision in the field; and the concrete material conditions of leaning in&#13;
specific schools in terms of availability of classrooms, furiniture, and cquipment.&#13;
2.      Decentrizaton of Educaion Adunistration:  Decision-making authority on&#13;
resource allocation, pcronnel deployment, and instructional operations shall be&#13;
decentralized first to dision offices, then to districts and then to schools. Decentralization&#13;
to 26 provinces covered by  TEEP will be given top priority.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -                              Annex 7&#13;
Decentralization in the first 6 pilot divisions will be implemented in 1996; an additional 8&#13;
divisions in 1997, and another 12 divisions in 1998. Not later than School Year 1998-&#13;
1999, decentralization to all other divisions will be proceed.&#13;
Starfing in 1997, pilots in district and school level decentralization will also be started.&#13;
After evaluation of these pilots and determination of the appropriate policy and procedural&#13;
changes, expansion of the coverage of district and school level decentralization will be&#13;
undertaken in the divisions covered by TEEP by 1998 and 1999. Similar decentralization&#13;
in the non-TEEP divisions wil be undertaken thereafter.&#13;
3.      Decentr&amp;aiz,aion of National Ed.cadon BIlt The allocation, release,&#13;
management and accounting of national government fumds for public elementary education&#13;
shall be decentralized. All central and national budget items for eventual use by division,&#13;
district and school operations shal be incorporated as part of the division's appropriations.&#13;
For the 1997 GAA, appropriate language will be sought that will authorize direct budgetary&#13;
releases to division offices with corresponding obligational and disbursement authorities&#13;
granted to division offices. Future budget allocations will be made increasingly location-&#13;
specific until all public elementary schools shall have become distinct decentraized&#13;
budgctary and administrative entities. Contributions of local governments shall be similarty&#13;
allocated, utilized and accounted to district and school levels.&#13;
4.      Devoltaon of Schoolhuildmr Construon: Consistent with provisions of the&#13;
Local Govemment Code of 1991, schoolbuilding construction shall be devolved to&#13;

4.    Measurement of Impact and Communication of Measurements:          A wide&#13;
variety of measurements shall be employed to fuLly inform decision-makers at various&#13;
levels of the impact and results of the improvement process. Sample-based student&#13;
assessments supplementing the NEAT shall be undertaken to generate information for&#13;
analyzing student outcomes in relation to administrative and pedagogical efforts. A&#13;
division based educational management information system (E-MIS) shall be installed and&#13;
operated to generate regular school operations data which can be processcd for use in&#13;
decentralized management decision-making. Annual participatory technical audits shall be&#13;
organized and undertaken to provide qualitative information, case studies, process&#13;
observations and similar data to supplement E-MIS and student assessment analyses.&#13;
Routine DECS  financial land administrative  monitoring  shall also  add  intemal&#13;
organizational data relevant to measurement of output and impact. Special evaluation&#13;
studies, field assessment missions and other forms of episodic measurements shall also be&#13;
undertaken.  The data and analysis produced by these efforts shall be publicized,&#13;
disseminated. and discussed at various levels, in various settings, and involving a wide&#13;
range of stakeholders.&#13;
5.    Community ParFiciation and Oversht    For each individual school, a&#13;
community-based forum shall be established and supported to perform a participatory role&#13;
and an oversight function in school improvements. Wherever the local School Board is&#13;
appropriate, it will be used for this purpose. Where there are active organizations operating&#13;
in the community that have a lcgitimate interest in and concern for the public school in the&#13;
community, such organizations shall be inked with the division, district or school as&#13;
appropriate in order to facilitate their participation in school improvement. PTCAs are, of&#13;
course, another available mechanism for the same purpose.&#13;
6.    Local Government Pari4oation and Oversieht    DECS shall enter into&#13;
agreements with LGUs which, among others, shall provide for a free flow of information&#13;
about public clementary education operations to the appropriate LGU bodies. Quarterly&#13;
financial and performance reports shall be prepared by divisions to inform LGUs about the&#13;
progress of school improvement.  The agreernents shall also define the substantive&#13;
involvement of LGUs in decision-malig and implementation affecting the local education&#13;
of children of their residents. This involvement shall not only cover those aspects for&#13;
which local government financing is being sought, but should also include all areas where&#13;
LGU expertise and knowledge could help produce better results.&#13;
7.    Accoumine. Andidinr and Fwnancl Rtworti.n:    Resources flowing into&#13;
divisions and schools that come from national government, local governments and&#13;
community contributions shall be properly accounted and recorded. Financial audits by&#13;
COA shall be routinely performed. Financial reports on all transactions shall be prepared&#13;
and submitted to pertinent authorities.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -                             Annex 7&#13;
Initial Application of these Policies&#13;
The above policies shall form the basic policy and institutional framework of the Third&#13;
Elementary Education Project. Some of these policies are essential pre-conditions for&#13;
effective implementation of TEEP; others are logical consequences of the technical work to&#13;
be undertaken under TEEP.&#13;
Part of the resources provided by TEEP shall be needed to build capacity and create&#13;
conditions for fully implementing the above policies. But the bulk of TEEP resources can&#13;
only be fully mobilized and optimally utiized when the above policies are firmly in place.&#13;
In this sense, these policies and TEEP are organically linked. Thus approval of the TEEP&#13;
investment proposal should be accompanied by corresponding approval of these proposed&#13;
policies.&#13;
The Department of Education, Culture and Sports seeks the approval of the Social&#13;
Development Committee of the above policies and the favorable endorsement of the same&#13;
to the Board of the National Economic Development Authority. Upon approval by the&#13;
government, these policies shall guide the coordination work with all agencies, including&#13;
the local governments. These policies shall also be communicated to the two main sources&#13;
of foreign financing of the TEEP, namely OECF and IBRD, as well as to other interested&#13;
parties involved in elementary education such as UNICEF, AUSAI), CIDA, JICA, and&#13;
local academic institutions assisting in education policy development.&#13;

totaling about 6 million individuals, are distributed around Northern and Central Luzon, Mindoro,&#13;
Western Mindanao and Sulu islands. The groups TEEP is most likely to affect are: (a) in the North, the&#13;
Apayao, Bontoc, Ibaloy, Ifugao, Kalinga, Kankanan and Tingguian; (b) in Visayas, the Negritos; and&#13;
(c) in the South, the Manobos, Tasaday, Manaraw, Yakan and Tausug. The Project file contains&#13;
information on each of these groups. During the pilot phase, the two groups whose specific problems&#13;
were raised and addressed in the DEDPs are the Ifugaos (most of Ifugao Province population) and the&#13;
Manobos (20 percent of Agusan del Sur). For practical purposes, the issues affecting the children of&#13;
plantation ("sacada") migrant workers are being treated under the same heading.&#13;
2.    Objectives. The main objective of the TEEP Strategy for indigeneous people is to ensure that&#13;
tribal minority groups in the provinces covered by the project receive culturally appropriate benefits.&#13;
This will be achieved through the informed participation of the people concerned in the preparation,&#13;
implementation, supervision and monitoring of project activities.&#13;
3.    In the context of the TEEP, the objective is to improve learning achievements, elementary school&#13;
completion rates and access to culturally appropriate quality elementary education for ethnic minority&#13;
communities.&#13;
4.    Strategy. The project strategy is based on the informed participation of the beneficiary&#13;
communities through:&#13;
(a)   Information of potential stakeholders in the minority communities (parents, community&#13;
leaders, teachers) of TEEP's objectives, approaches and implementation modalities to&#13;
gain their active involvement. As for all other aspects of the DEDPs, community&#13;
mobilization methods will be used.&#13;
(b)    Consultation and participatory planning involving the local community (Parent Teacher&#13;
Associations and School Management Advisory Committees) in the planning of civil&#13;
works, in the identification of their perceived educational needs including provisions for&#13;
indigenization of the curriculum and teaching materials, and in the assessment of project&#13;
performance in meeting these needs.&#13;
(c)    Advice/assistance to local school management by School Management Advisory&#13;
Committee appointed/elected by Parent Teacher Associations.&#13;
(d)    Annual participatory performance audits based on beneficiary assessment techniques&#13;
will provide a feed-back mechanism to adjust project plans and implementation through&#13;
identification of the stakeholder's perception of problems and acceptable solutions to&#13;
these.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 100 -                                Annex I1&#13;
5.    To achieve this level of participation, the project's School Improvement and Innovation Facility&#13;
(SIIF) will de facto target resources to "marginalized" schools, many of which are likely to be in&#13;
minority areas, to engage the involved communities in diagnosing their problems and in defining and&#13;
implementing their own improvement plans.&#13;
6.    Components and Activities. Activities relevant to ethnic minority communities which can be&#13;
supported by SIIF funds are:&#13;
*  School empowerment where School Management Advisory Committees and PTAs are&#13;
supported to establish a capacity to advise local school affairs.&#13;
*  School improvement plans which will include experiments with a more flexible approach to&#13;
school attendance, so that it is adapted to the possibilities and constraints imposed by local&#13;
seasonal agricultural calendars and work requirements.&#13;
*  Indigenization of educational materials and curriculum  through the (i) development/&#13;
adaptation of learning materials to make them relevant in a local cultural context; (ii) active&#13;
recruitment/training of indigenous people as teachers; (iii) training of teachers to be&#13;
culturally sensitive to handle classes with indigenous pupils.&#13;
*  Special poverty-oriented demand-side programs which will make education more affordable&#13;
to the poorest among IP and improve the readiness of poor indigenous children for school.&#13;
The program consist of small scholarships to cover direct and indirect schooling costs, and&#13;
the development of a model for school health and nutrition programs.&#13;
-  Early Childhood Development (ECD) programs to increase readiness for school and&#13;
teachability, including the transition from the vernacular to the official language of&#13;
instruction.&#13;
7.    In addition to the above, a special SIIF component of the TEEP will address the needs of&#13;
nomadic and migrant children by building on the experience of both the UNICEF-supported program of&#13;
multigrade schools and the ADB-funded Informal Education Project, or other alternative strategies. This&#13;
activity will experiment with multilevel, modular teaching materials that would be made available in&#13;
existing formal or non-formal education facilities operating along flexible schedules. Pupils could pick&#13;
up the curriculum where they had left it, wherever the agricultural or seasonal cycle would allow them to&#13;
resume studying. This activity will be preceded by a comprehensive stock-taking exercise because of the&#13;
large body of previous experiments along these lines which have never been institutionalized, and&#13;
because of potential economies of scale with other activities. For this reason, this component will at best&#13;
start in PY2 or PY3.&#13;
8.    The impact of the activities listed above are expected to be (i) improved learning achievement;&#13;
(ii) higher completion rates; and (iii) expanded access to quality education for indigenous people.&#13;
9.    Approach. Preparation of the DEDPs will continue to involve sociologists to ensure that the&#13;
rights and interests of indigenous people are fully taken into account. Representatives of ethnic groups&#13;
will be fully integrated in the participatory planning and evaluation activities, especially the annual&#13;
performance audit to be conducted with NGOs and the Beneficiary Assessment which will precede the&#13;
mid-term review (2000). The PISU contact person for each province will ensure that the National&#13;
Authorities concerned (such as the Office for Northern Cultural Communities or the Office of Muslim&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Affairs, full list in the Project File) are kept informed of DEDP activities and that these comply with&#13;
national policies. In appraising/reviewing DEDP proposals affecting minorities, PISU will use the&#13;
following criteria: (a) interest on the part of the group concerned; (b) potential impact, based on the&#13;
numbers affected; (c) transferability, to achieve economies of scale; (d) availability (of materials,&#13;
courses...); and (e) previous involvement of other agencies.&#13;
10.    Monitoring. Each of the activities listed above as well as the participatory approach will be&#13;
monitored as part of the provincial level DEDPs through:&#13;
*  Annual participatory performance audits which include beneficiary assessment techniques to&#13;
identify the perception of problems by stakeholders.&#13;
*  Collection of disaggregated monitoring data on minorities regarding the relevant Project&#13;
Performance Indicators (see Annex 5).&#13;

THIRD ELEMENTARY EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SCHOOL BUILDING PROGRAM&#13;
1.     Planning. As part of DEDP preparation, new classroom needs will be estimated based&#13;
on: (i) enrollment projections reflecting Grade 1 intake, demographic trends and objectives for&#13;
repetition and drop out; (ii) improved ratio pupils/classroom resulting inter alia related inter alia&#13;
from the expansion of multigrade teaching; and (iii) existing classroom after deduction of&#13;
dilapidated, non repairable buildings. The location of new classrooms/schools will be based on&#13;
actual needs as determined by population density and distance criteria specified in the&#13;
Guidelines. This municipal school mapping is also to be conducted during DEDP preparation&#13;
and involve interested stakeholders as Municipalities, National Statistical Office provincial&#13;
representatives, PTA's representatives and DO-PISU civil-work cell staff.&#13;
2.     Devolution of SBP implementation. Under TEEP, the Municipalities (MLGUs) will&#13;
implement the school building program (SBP) within their respective territory, through their&#13;
respective Municipal Engineering Offices (MEO). This devolution presents several advantages:&#13;
(i) physical proximity and closer monitoring, leading to better quality of work; (ii) increased&#13;
utilization of local community labor, generating lower costs, heightened community ownership&#13;
and greater commitment to maintenance; (iii) better integration of municipal investment&#13;
programs across sectors; and (iii) more active Municipal support for education.  All&#13;
Municipalities have a Municipal Engineering Office staffed with at least 2 engineers, technically&#13;
competent to monitor a municipal SBP. The Municipal commitments to implement the SBP&#13;
within their respective area will be embodied in the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) to be&#13;
signed between Mayors and Superintendent and annexed to each DEDP. A model DECS-LGUs&#13;
MOA was agreed during negotiation.&#13;
3.     Municipal cost sharing. Since the LGUs' share in the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA)&#13;
will increase from 35 to 40 percent in 1997, the GoP introduces through TEEP a cost-sharing&#13;
between the Central and the Local Governments (the Municipalities) for school construction.&#13;
This policy, in line with the provisions of the Local Government Code (LGC), will increase the&#13;
responsibility and accountability of the Municipalities in the SBP, and will help directing&#13;
additional new municipal resources to education. In the short run, the GoP/Municipal LGU cost-&#13;
sharing policy for the SBP will only apply to the 26 TEEP Provinces. The LGU contribution&#13;
will range between 10-30 percent of construction costs, with an average of 25 percent . The&#13;
Memorandum of Agreement to be signed between Mayors and Superintendent and annexed to&#13;
the DEDPs will reflect these provisions.&#13;
4.     Summary of financing arrangements. The following financing arrangements between&#13;
GoP, OECF and IBRD will apply to the SBP: (i) the total financing needs for the SBP will be&#13;
During this period the Municipalities of non-TEEP Provinces will not contribute to the cost of their SBP.&#13;
Therefore, for equity reasons, TEEP Municipal LGUs will only cost-share the fraction of the SBP considered to&#13;
be additional to the regular program that they should receive without TEEP, e.g., 50 per cent of the proposed&#13;
SBP. For these 50 per cent, DECS, DoF and NEDA agree that the Municipal share will average 50 per cent of&#13;
total construction costs. For simplicity's sake, the Municipal contribution (= 50 per cent of 50 per cent of the&#13;
SBP cost) will be defined as 25 per cent of the total cost of the SBP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 103 -                            Annex 12&#13;
shared between the Philippines Central and Municipal Local Governments for 50 per cent, and&#13;
the donors (IBRD and OECF) for the remaining 50 per cent; (ii) the two donors will support the&#13;
program in equal parts, meaning each of them will support 25 per cent of the total program cost;&#13;
(iii) the LGUs will contribute a total of 25 per cent on average, (see para above) of the total&#13;
program cost, leaving 25 per cent on average to the GoP. The two donors will not co-finance the&#13;
same buildings, but will intervene in distinct provinces, so that in their respective area, their&#13;
respective financial contribution will apply to 50 percent of construction costs. The distribution&#13;
of the Provinces between WB and OECF is specified in the TEEP Guidelines.&#13;
5.    Implementation arrangements. Implementation of the SBP by the Municipalities will&#13;
follow one of four models, ranked by decreasing order of preference: (a) contract between the&#13;
Municipality and a civil-work contractor; (b) contract between the Municipality and a local&#13;
community covering all aspects of implementation, including materials purchase;&#13;
(c) combination of site-material supply by the Municipality and labor supply by the community&#13;
(Pakyaw); and (d) Force Account. The appropriate solution will be selected during DEDP&#13;
preparation based on pre-agreed criteria described in the TEEP Guidelines.&#13;
6.    Community participation. Options b) and c) can potentially maximize community&#13;
participation in construction work, with a wide range of benefits, including: (i) generation of&#13;
local employment and economic benefits; (ii) higher quality and lower construction costs;&#13;
(iii) enhanced likelihood of long term community commitment to the school, including better&#13;
building maintenance (iv) enhanced community capacity and skills, and (iv) on the part of the&#13;
parents, increased sense of ownership and, consequently, project sustainability.&#13;
7.    School building design and cost. During Project preparation, DECS-CO prepared (a) a&#13;
limited set of 4 different architectural models allowing better adaptation to the wide range of&#13;
provincial physical conditions (multi-stories for urban or mountainous sites, multigrade teaching&#13;
adapted design, and adapted window pattern to local climate constraints); and (b) a formula for&#13;
unit cost estimation which takes into account the distance over which construction materials have&#13;
to be transported. DECS-CO will disseminate the standardized models and the provincial&#13;
average unit cost to all TEEP DOs. The selection of the architectural model as well as of the&#13;
implementation arrangements (para 4) are part of DEDP preparation and will be discussed&#13;
among the stakeholders during that process. They will both be specified in the DEDP document&#13;
as well as in the MOA to be signed between the concerned Municipalities and DECS DO and&#13;
annexed to the DEDP. Data for all school building management arrangements will be entered in&#13;
the MIS in order to monitor, both at DO and CO levels, the completion schedule, efficiency and&#13;
cost-effectiveness of each operation under the SBP. Architectural Models and Unit Cost&#13;
Formula are in the Guidelines.&#13;
8.    Procurement procedures. There will be two different procurement procedures&#13;
corresponding to the implementation arrangements described in para. 4: (a) Contracts with&#13;
contractors and site-materials suppliers will follow simplified procedures, similar to WB&#13;
definition of national shopping, applying government procedures by comparing at least three&#13;
price quotations obtained through local advertising managed by the MLGUs through their&#13;
municipal PBAC according to the provisions of the LGC, with representatives of the beneficiary&#13;
communities and schools participating in the discussions of the PBAC; (b) Contracts with&#13;
communities based on pre-agreed unit costs, defined in the DEDP and below the cost ceiling set&#13;
by DECS-CO. Detailed procedures and Standardized bidding documents contracts between the&#13;
Municipalities and the contractors/suppliers /communities, are provided in the TEEP Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 104 -                            Annex 12&#13;
9.    Flow of funds. GoP, WB and OECF funds for the SBP will be channeled to the MLGUs&#13;
through the Municipal Development Fund (MDF) as follows: (a) GoP funds - each year MDF&#13;
will receive from GAA GoP's annual contribution to the SBP -- equal to 25 per cent of the total&#13;
annual SBP cost for the 26 TEEP Provinces -- and transfer to all the TEEP LGU treasurers the&#13;
GoP contribution to their Municipal SBP as specified in the corresponding DEDP and related&#13;
MOA; (b) WB or OECF funds - MDF will open one Special Account (SA) for each of these&#13;
funds with an Authorized Allocation (AA) of US$3 million; WB and OECF will make an initial&#13;
deposit of US$1.5 million. Details on the flow of funds are provided in the Guidelines. Specific&#13;
arrangements governing the channeling of GAA funds to MDF for the SBP are stipulated in the&#13;
three MOAs signed between DECS and DBM, DECS and DoF and DECS and DPWH.&#13;
10.   Payment of the works. The MLGUs will pay the contractor/supplier/community group,&#13;
against invoices based on their contracts. Monitoring of the works will be the responsibility of&#13;
the Municipal Engineering Office (MEO). Evidence of progress will be supported by adequate&#13;
documentation certified by the MEO and countersigned by the Principal or his representative.&#13;
Evidence of final completion would include acceptance of the new classroom by DECS&#13;
representative (School Principal or District Supervisor). Details of the payment procedure and&#13;
models of documents certifying the progress or completion of work are provided in the&#13;
Guidelines.&#13;
11.   Reimbursement of the Municipalities. As the MLGUs will receive in advance the GoP&#13;
share of the SBP cost (25 per cent on average) and contribute another 25 percent (the total of&#13;
GoP and MLGU contribution always adding up to 50 per cent), they will be reimbursed by the&#13;
Central Government for the remaining 50 per cent of their SBP expenditures. Reimbursement&#13;
will be done by MDF from the relevant WB or OECF Special Account, against SOEs certified by&#13;
COA. Model SOEs are provided in the Guidelines.&#13;
12.   Replenishment of MDF's Sas. On a monthly basis, MDF will transmit to DECS-CO the&#13;
aggregated SOE summaries for replenishment by IBRD and OECF of 50 percent of SBP costs.&#13;
PISU-CO will review and transmit the summaries to IBRD and OECF according to the agreed&#13;
distribution of TEEP provinces between them. IBRD and OECF will directly replenish each of&#13;
the relevant MDF's SA for the corresponding amount. Details on the arrangements for the&#13;
operation of MDF's SA are provided in the MOA signed between DECS and DoF.&#13;
13.   Accounting and auditing. MLGUs will send to MDF SOEs already certified by the local&#13;
Commission of Audits (COA) who will provide a full-time auditor for TEEP SBP. Every month,&#13;
the national COA will conduct a post-audit of the SBP. Should COA determine that these&#13;
standards have not been complied with, the corresponding amounts will be automatically&#13;
deducted from the next invoice submitted by the concerned Municipality.&#13;
14.   Transparency. The entire process -- i.e. inputs, procedures and outputs -- of the school&#13;
building program will be monitored closely by the DO's PISU/civil-works cell against&#13;
performance indicators defined in the DEDP and included in the MIS. Data on inputs, procedures&#13;
and outputs will be analyzed through special features of the MIS and results will be disseminated&#13;
to all stakeholders through the Advocacy campaign. Procedures to ensure transparency are&#13;
described in the TEEP Guidelines.&#13;

PHILIPPINES&#13;
THIRD ELEMENTARY EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
Objectives and Strategy&#13;
1.    Bank Inputs. TEEP's supervision plan aims to (a) ensure timely and effective implementation&#13;
of the various programs and disbursements; (b) build the capacity of DECS at the central and divisional&#13;
levels to supervise and evaluate elementary education sub-projects; (c) strengthen collaboration among&#13;
concerned donors.&#13;
2.    Because capacity-building is at the core of TEEP, it is proposed that responsibility for&#13;
supervision be increasingly shifted to the Resident Mission. This will allow (a) formal and on the job&#13;
training of PISU staff and consultants in supervision techniques; and (b) close monitoring of&#13;
implementation, procurement and disbursement through quarterly field missions (two with, an two&#13;
without HQ participation; will decline to two by PY3) and close contact with the PISU, DoF's CCPAP&#13;
and NEDA's Project Monitoring Staff.&#13;
3.    At the moment, donors for the project are OECF and the Bank.  AusAID, CIDA,&#13;
UNDP/UNICEF, and (subject to confirmation) the Irish Government also support TEEP. The donors&#13;
will have quarterly meetings with the PISU. OECF and the Bank will conduct joint supervision missions&#13;
initially twice a year, and at least once a year after PY3, and will exchange supervision reports. The&#13;
other donors will be invited to join in once a year. Supervision will be thematic and will include, in&#13;
addition to the usual measures of successful implementation--procurement and disbursement--then ten&#13;
indicators presented in Annex 6 and qualitative aspects such as classroom processes, the use of&#13;
textbooks, and LGU/community participation. The supervision work will be increasingly provided by&#13;
the RM, with HQ staff and consultants as needed. The annual GoP/Donor reviews will be held by March&#13;
31 and September 30 of each year (specify date) to match GoP's budget cycle.&#13;
4.    During PYI, supervision will concentrate on capacity-building in supervision techniques and on&#13;
project launch activities in the six pilot provinces. Beginning in PY2, it will focus on PISU's&#13;
management and supervision capacity of active DEDPs, spot-checks of Divisional, District and school-&#13;
based implementation activities, and launching activities for the following batches of provinces.&#13;
Staffing for Bank Inputs&#13;
5.    The following basic staffing arrangement is proposed:&#13;
Task Manager in HQ, to provide overall guidance;&#13;
Co-TM in the RM for day-to-day management and&#13;
procurement/disbursement/auditing supervision&#13;
Local Support Consultants&#13;
Bank Staff and International Consultants, initially twice a year, to decline&#13;
to once a year once the project is fully on track (PY3).&#13;
Over time, Task Management will shift to the Resident Mission, with support from HQ. The&#13;
specialization of the consultants will be determined by the nature of the problems identified during&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 109 -                               Annex 13&#13;
implementation. Specialized expertise will be brought to bear when needed outside the formal mission&#13;
structure.&#13;
GoP Inputs&#13;
6.    Annual work plans and budgets (AWPB) will be prepared by each DO within the context of its&#13;
approved DEDP, and for each capacity-building (sub)component. These plans will be reviewed by the&#13;
PISU, which will make a recommendation for approval by the TEEP Managing Council. The sum of all&#13;
the approved AWPBs will constitute the overall annual project plan.&#13;
7.    Quarterly progress reports (February 28, May 31, August 31 and November 30) will be&#13;
submitted by the PISU to the donors in a format agreed during appraisal. The reports will include:&#13;
Narrative Report&#13;
(a)    a concise narrative section describing (i) activities undertaken under the annual work&#13;
plan (AWP) since the last reporting period; (ii) activities initiated under the APW; and&#13;
(iii) additional, unplanned activities;&#13;
(b)    major achievements;&#13;
(c)    problems encountered and solutions proposed;&#13;
(d)    activities planned for the next reporting period: (i) as per the AWP and (ii) other, with&#13;
explanation and rationale;&#13;
Statistical Report: a province by province one page summary tabular account built from eight reporting&#13;
forms: (i) DEDP Activity Report, including an update of basic data, inputs delivery, and qualitative&#13;
assessments (e.g., of learning) when available; (ii) DEDP Activities to be added/dropped in the AWP;&#13;
(iii) DEDP Fund Advance Report Summary; (iv) DEDP Expenditures by Activity; (v) DEDP expenditure&#13;
by Category; (vi) DEDP Procurement Actions; (vii) DEDP Additional Staff Appointrnents; (viii) DEDP&#13;
Claims of Reimbursement for eligible expenditures.&#13;
To the extent possible, the reports will use automatic reporting built-in in the MIS. The May and&#13;
November reports will be shorter. The February report which will form the basis for a budget review,&#13;
will include TEEP counterpart proposals.&#13;
8.    The September annual joint GoP/Donors performance review will be based, in addition to the&#13;
above, on the financial audit report for the preceding year and on a participatory performance audit&#13;
(PPA). The PPA is meant to complement the mechanical review of procurement and disbursements by a&#13;
more qualitative monitoring of processes at the grass-root level, especially in the following areas:&#13;
(a) capacity-building in the DOs; (b) implementation of the pilots (SIIF, school empowerment, ECD);&#13;
(c) school and classroom processes; and (d) effectiveness of the participation process. The PPA will be&#13;
contracted to a management consulting firm with sub-contracts to NGOs in the provinces. The staff of&#13;
the NGOs will receive training on TEEP and on the indicators to be monitored. They will conduct spot-&#13;
checks of about 5-10% of field activities and discuss with the communities at large (DECS, LGUs,&#13;
PTAs) their perceptions of TEEP implementation, problems identified and solutions proposed. Based on&#13;
the PPA, the donors will agree with DECS on which sites they themselves will visit during their missions&#13;
(success stories vs. problem cases).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

9.    The PISU will monitor and report on implementation progress, based on inputs from the relevant&#13;
entities and using the MIS. Additionally, it will organize provincial level project launch workshops and&#13;
implementation reviews. These reviews will be timed to support the joint GoP/Donors review.&#13;
10.   The PISU will coordinate arrangements for supervision missions, including the timely (one&#13;
month advance) dispatch of supporting documentation to the donors. Mission briefings upon arrival and&#13;
wrap-up meetings will be chaired by DECS Secretary and will include, for the annual review, high-level&#13;
representation from DoF, NEDA and DBM.&#13;
11.   The PISU will prepare and submit to IBRD, within six months of the Closing Date, a final&#13;
Implementation Completion Report and a plan for the future operation of the completed project.&#13;

12.   Joint Annual reviews will be held in October and the budget reviews, in March of each year. A&#13;
comprehensive mid-term review will be held in March 2000. It will determine whether there is a need to&#13;
restructure the project or modify the implementation targets of all or some components.&#13;
13.   Each mission will involve: (a) at least one week in the field (over the life of the project, each&#13;
province will be visited at least once); (b) the services of one education specialist and one&#13;
management/implementation specialist; (c) a review of procurement, civil works, financial statements&#13;
and disbursements, Loan covenants, technical assistance textbook delivery in remote schools and training&#13;
activities. The specialized skills to be added on the basis of needs will include: education finance,&#13;
educational decentralization, teacher training, MIS, textbooks and instructional materials, school-based&#13;
management, research and assessment.&#13;
14.   Initially all missions will be jointly conducted by the donors. The desirability and feasibility of&#13;
limiting the number ofjoint missions to one per year will be reviewed at the mid-term review (2000).&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Third Elementary Education Project
            (TEEP) aims to: a) build the institutional capacity of DECs
            (Department of Education, Culture and Sports) to manage the
            change process associated with TEEP; and b) improve learning
            achievements, completion rates and access to quality
            elementary education in 26 poor provinces.  To achieve its
            objective, the project will have a policy and institutional
            framework (PIF) and two investment components.  The PIF
            will: a) improve the adequacy, efficiency and equity of
            sub-sector funding; b) ensure that basic inputs are
            delivered; c) introduce systems and procedures to
            decentralize selected education functions and corresponding
            resources; d) measure the impact of project interventions on
            cost and learning; and e) provide a framework for handling
            resettlement issues.  The first investment component is
            capacity building at the national and regional levels which
            will: create a national structure for project management and
            capacity strengthening; build capacities in support of
            policy and decision making; and build capacities in support
            of decentralized implementation and effective schools.  The
            second investment component is educational improvement in 26
            poor provinces.  This will: a) strengthen capacities in the
            divisional offices, local government units and other TEEP
            stakeholders; and b) develop and implement Divisional
            Elementary Education Development Plans which will improve
            learning, raise completion rates and expand access.
