          FOSTERING INNOVATION FOR PRODUCTIVITY AND COMPETITIVENESS&#13;
&#13;
                                       EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;· Message 1. Mexico can exploit better the opportunities for technological progress and&#13;
      productivity offered by its proximity to the United States. Given the multisectoral nature of&#13;
      innovation, better coordination in policymaking, stronger mechanisms to define budgetary&#13;
      priorities, and greater synergies among public policy interventions is necessary. A holistic&#13;
      innovation strategy as used in highly innovative economies such as Finland could help guide&#13;
      such efforts. A policy of more systematic impact evaluations of programs related to&#13;
      innovation needs to be in place along with the development of the necessary capabilities to&#13;
      be able to implement it.&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;· Message 2. The research base needs to be strengthened through increased investments in&#13;
      public R&amp;D, and much further collaboration needs to be encouraged between universities&#13;
      and the productive sector to better use existing technological capacities and deploy&#13;
      incremental R&amp;D investments to move the productive sector up the value chain. Such&#13;
      collaborations could be encouraged through funding, more adequate rules on intellectual&#13;
      property rights and incentives at universities, and the development of specialized skills and&#13;
      intermediaries that facilitate technology transfer.&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;· Message 3. A policy on human resources for innovation should be defined that addresses&#13;
      challenges at various stages of human resources formation Efforts to increase the formation&#13;
      of advanced human resources need to be sustained, with attention to enhancing the quality&#13;
      of domestic graduate education programs along with greater studentsâ&#128;&#153; participation in&#13;
      international programs.&#13;

&#13;
                                           OBJECTIVE&#13;
&#13;
This note provides a medium-term agenda for supporting Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s competitiveness by&#13;
fostering greater innovation. Globalization and the dynamism of economies that compete with&#13;
Mexico, particularly those in East Asia, bring a renewed urgency to Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s innovation policy&#13;
agenda. While the firm is at the center of innovation, empirical evidence shows that public policy&#13;
can generate an external environment more conducive to innovation. The past decade has&#13;
brought several policy changes and new programs, but further changes would help the country&#13;
catch up with more innovative economies and move up the value chain. Given the multisectoral&#13;
nature of innovation and multiplicity of programs, better coordination in policymaking, stronger&#13;
mechanisms to define budgetary priorities for innovation, and greater coherence and synergies&#13;
among public policy interventions are necessary. A comprehensive innovation strategy as used in&#13;
highly innovative economies such as Finland could help guide such efforts.&#13;
                                        KEY CHALLENGES&#13;
&#13;
Boosting innovation is critical to Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s growth and competitiveness. Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s growth,&#13;
low relative to the countryâ&#128;&#153;s potential, has been driven mainly by accumulation in labor and&#13;
capital. Over 2005â&#128;&#147;08 the contribution of total factor productivity was small and negative (â&#128;&#147;2&#13;
percent). This raises serious concerns because empirical research has shown that total factor&#13;
productivity explains a substantial share of the difference in per capita income between&#13;
developed and developing countries (Bosworth and Collins, 2003). According to the research, a&#13;
substantial share of differences in total factor productivity are explained by technological&#13;
progress or innovation broadly defined, meaning new combinations of existing resources (Romer&#13;
1990, and Aghion and Howitt, 2007), . Innovation can occur through organizational changes,&#13;
changes in managerial practices, new methods of production, new sources of supply,&#13;
development of new products, or upgrades to the quality of existing products. Technological&#13;
progress can result from adopting knowledge that is globally available (â&#128;&#156;catching upâ&#128;?) or&#13;
developing new knowledge. Both are relevant to Mexico, depending on the sectorâ&#128;&#153;s state of&#13;
development. Information on Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s performance with regard to a variety of indicators&#13;
follows. Some caution in their interpretation is important given the challenges faced in&#13;
measuring innovation as the literature points out.&#13;
&#13;
Intermediary indicators for technology-based innovation such as investments in research&#13;
and development (R&amp;D) and patents suggest that Mexico faces an innovation shortfall. The&#13;
countryâ&#128;&#153;s overall investment in R&amp;D remains low compared with countries with similar GDP&#13;
per capita: 0.4 percent of GDP in 2009 (figure 1), well below other emerging markets such as&#13;
Brazil (1.2 percent) and China (1.7 percent) and even farther from top innovation countries such&#13;
as the Republic of Korea (3.7 percent) and Sweden (3.4 percent). Over the past decade Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
private sector expenditure on R&amp;D rose but remains low. Despite a recent increase, public&#13;
expenditure on R&amp;D as percent of GDP is barely above levels at the beginning of the last&#13;
decade. In highly innovative economies R&amp;D expenditure is driven primarily by the private&#13;
sector, but the public sector is likely to play a greater role in emerging markets that are building&#13;
core technological capabilities and that confront more acute market failures.1 The number of&#13;
patents granted to Mexican nationals by the U.S. Patent Office has not changed much since the&#13;
late 1990s and remains low; by contrast, the number of patents granted to many Organisation for&#13;
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries and select emerging markets has&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                       Mexico Policy Note 3&#13;
&#13;
surged.2 Between 2000 and 2008, for example, the number of patents granted to China more than&#13;
tripled, and the number granted to the Republic of Korea more than doubled. Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
stagnation in patenting occurred despite an increase in R&amp;D, which could signal weak&#13;
connectivity between research centers and the productive sector.&#13;
Technology licensing by firms--a mechanism to benefit from globally available&#13;
technologies--also appears lower than in peer countries. According to World Bank Enterprise&#13;
Surveys, the percentage of Mexican firms using foreign licensed technologies is close to 10&#13;
percent, compared with 13 percent in Brazil and 16 percent in Turkey.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
The gap in non-technological inputs and forms of innovation appears less acute. A recent&#13;
survey showed that management practices of Mexican firmsâ&#128;&#148;another important input to firm&#13;
performanceâ&#128;&#148;were superior to those of Brazil and Chile but still below those of more advanced&#13;
economies (figure 2). This could result from the countryâ&#128;&#153;s greater connectivity with the United&#13;
States. Further, the quality of exports, measured by the price that Mexican goods command in the&#13;
United States, has been rising faster than the regional average, though it started at a below-&#13;
average level.3&#13;
Several factors help explain gaps in Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s innovation performance. Innovation is a&#13;
process of knowledge creation and accumulation by economic agents that depends heavily on the&#13;
external environment and available resources. At the center of growth and innovation is the firm,&#13;
and barriers to accumulation of either physical capital (K) or knowledge capital (A) can stimulate&#13;
or stifle innovation. Figure 3 illustrates drivers of innovation, on both the demand and knowledge&#13;
supply sides. In Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s case less than adequate competition, labor market rigidities, serious&#13;
gaps in human resources, very limited financing for startups, andâ&#128;&#148;critically importantâ&#128;&#148;weak&#13;
links between the productive sector and knowledge institutions have all contributed to the&#13;
&#13;

shortfall. While various market failures justify government intervention, little information is&#13;
available on the impact of most government programs to foster innovation. These issues are&#13;
further discussed below.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
The demand for innovation: need to improve the investment climate&#13;
Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s investment climate does not favor the demand for innovation. Competition, which&#13;
has a substantial impact on firm behavior, can be an important driver of innovation. Moreover,&#13;
competition from innovative new firms can be particularly important in achieving productivity&#13;
gains. Yet Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s competition environment is less than favorable in many sectors. 4 The World&#13;
Economic Forum ranks the intensity of local competition at 84 out of 142 countries and the&#13;
extent of market dominance at 124. Restrictions on foreign ownership in key network industries&#13;
are not contributing to competition and innovation in those industries either. In addition,&#13;
regulations constraining labor reallocation have also likely had an adverse impact on the density&#13;
of startups and reduced existing companiesâ&#128;&#153; demand for investment in new technologies.&#13;
Broadly speaking, universitiesâ&#128;&#153; rules on intellectual property rights are not incentivizing&#13;
researchers to transform their knowledge into innovations and collaborations with industry as&#13;
further discussed below.&#13;
&#13;
The supply side: need to enhance human resource development&#13;
&#13;
Over the past decade Mexico has made very important progress in the development of its&#13;
human resources, a critical pillar of an innovative economy, but further efforts will be&#13;
necessary since it has not closed the gaps with its peers. Quality and quantity gaps remain at&#13;
all stages of the education system. Mexico has seen impressive growth in the participation rate in&#13;
secondary education but still lags rates in Brazil, Chile and the OECD. Graduation rates for&#13;
students in secondary education are low, at just 45 percent. International learning tests also point&#13;
to quality problems in the basic education system, creating a severe bottleneck to expanding the&#13;
tertiary system.5 Enrollment in tertiary education among the relevant age cohort was 27 percent&#13;
in 2009, a good progress over the past decade, but still below the rate in Brazil (36 percent),&#13;
&#13;
World Bank- Innovation                                                                            4&#13;
&amp;#12;                                  Mexico Policy Note 3&#13;
&#13;
Turkey (46 percent), and Chile (59 percent). The tertiary system also confronts quality&#13;
challenges, with many graduates often not meeting the skills demanded by the labor market, for&#13;
example skills demanded by the software industry. To address this gap, Mexico First, part of a&#13;
larger initiative to support the growth of the software industry (Prosoft 2.0), has facilitated the&#13;
development of a public-private partnership that has helped overcome skills mismatch; similar&#13;
partnerships could be replicated in other key industries.6 In addition, few universities offer&#13;
entrepreneurship training.&#13;
Despite Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s increased investment in advanced human capital, the number of&#13;
researchers has not caught up with its peers. The number of researchers has increased about&#13;
80 percent over the last decade, a result of sustained government efforts to fund training and&#13;
education in technical areas. However, Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s 1 researcher per 1,000 members of the labor&#13;
force in 2009 is still below that of comparator countries (1.5 in China, 1.3 in Brazil, and 2.4 in&#13;
Turkey) and substantially below advanced economies (10 in the Republic of Korea). Moreover,&#13;
the share of researchers in the private sector in Mexico (less than 40 percent in 2009) is lower&#13;
than in highly innovative economies (69 percent in the Republic of Korea). This limits the&#13;
adoption of new technologies, solving of production issues, and development of new products.&#13;
&#13;
The low share of international graduate students limits knowledge transfer from abroad&#13;
and international integration of the Mexican innovation system. Despite higher cultural and&#13;
linguistic obstacles, data from UNESCO indicates that the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, and&#13;
Thailand have more students studying in the United States than does Mexico. The countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
share has hovered around 2.1-2.4 of the total. Even Vietnam, with a much lower GDP per capita&#13;
than Mexico, has nearly caught up. International students bring new ideas and knowledge to&#13;
Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s innovation system and are a critical bridge to the global scientific and economic&#13;
community once in the labor force.&#13;
Weak links and missing agents in Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s innovation ecosystem&#13;
&#13;
Collaborations between industry and research centers have increased modestly in recent&#13;
years but remain far and few compared with the active knowledge exchanges in dynamic&#13;
innovation ecosystems (figure 4). Cooperation between industry and academia has been&#13;
minimal due to different incentives and cultures. Public funding of science and technology&#13;
programs have traditionally not favored such collaborations, as discussed below; initiatives to&#13;
foster technology transfer have emerged only since the mid-2000s. In addition, regulations on&#13;
intellectual property management (that is, regulations on how to share the monetary benefits&#13;
derived from technology transfer with researchers) of many research centers and universities has&#13;
not encouraged the transfer of knowhow, and capacity for managing intellectual property at these&#13;
institutions has been very low. At the same time, skills gaps and lack of capacity to absorb&#13;
knowledge in the productive sector have constrained demand for such exchanges.&#13;

&#13;
In addition to investment climate issues, inadequate financing and other missing links are&#13;
holding back the entry of higher value firms with the potential to contribute to Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
structural transformation. The number of newly registered firms is very low in Mexico at 0.6&#13;
per 1,000 workers compared with 2.4 in Brazil and 4.4 for the OECD according to the World&#13;
Bank Entrepreneurship snapshots and 6.3 in China according to the Global Entrepreneurship&#13;
Monitor (2010). Forming higher value firms (whether technology-based or not) is notoriously&#13;
challenging worldwide and more so in emerging markets, which have few angel investors and&#13;
inadequate venture capital funding. New entrepreneurs also face a steep learning curve, making&#13;
support structures that facilitate mentoring and networking to markets and financiers very&#13;
valuable. A few initiatives are trying to address these gaps; Nacional Financiera is fostering a&#13;
venture capital industry through a â&#128;&#156;fund of fundsâ&#128;?; the Ministry of Economy is supporting&#13;
incubators and business accelerators; and Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y TecnologÃ­a&#13;
(CONACYT) has piloted some initiatives to support the creation of new technology-based firms.&#13;
Diversity of science, technology, and innovation programs but incomplete information on&#13;
outcomes&#13;
Over the past decade several policy changes have been implemented to address key market&#13;
failures and build the capabilities needed for innovation, but little information is available&#13;
on the impact of these initiatives. Policy changes started with the Law on Science and&#13;
Technology in 2002, and subsequent amendments in 2009 emphasized the importance of&#13;
innovation and incorporated better incentives for technology transfer by CONACYTâ&#128;&#153;s public&#13;
research centers, which has led to several new programs. Many other institutions (most&#13;
prominently the Ministry of Economy) also support innovation-related activities. But not enough&#13;
information is available on the performance and impact of these programs.&#13;
&#13;
Adopting existing knowledge is as important as developing new knowledge, and to address&#13;
this gap, the Mexican government has deployed multiple programs for small and medium-&#13;
size enterprises. Nelson and Winter (1982) point out that firms face a â&#128;&#156;bounded rationalityâ&#128;? and&#13;
often find difficulty adopting new knowledge because they do not know where the frontier is. In&#13;
most cases firms develop the knowledge of how to do things incrementally, and such knowledge&#13;
then becomes routines. Routines contribute to the day-to-day operation of the firm but constrain&#13;
&#13;
World Bank- Innovation                                                                        6&#13;
&amp;#12;                                  Mexico Policy Note 3&#13;
&#13;
the adoption of new knowledge. Enhancing management ability to adopt and manage best&#13;
practices and new technologies through well targeted support can increase firm productivity&#13;
dramatically, as the rigorous randomized experiment conducted Bloom et al. (2011) in the textile&#13;
sector illustrates.7 Aware of these difficulties, the Mexican government has several programs (for&#13;
example, Fondo de Apoyo para la Micro, PequeÃ±a y Mediana Empresa) that help small and&#13;
medium-size enterprises enhance absorptive capacity through new forms of work organization,&#13;
improved business practices, modern manufacturing processes, and investment in worker&#13;
training.&#13;
Program effectiveness is unclear, and the large number of existing programs suggests&#13;
pulverization and overlaps. A 2011 World Bank study identified 151 small and medium-size&#13;
enterprise programs administered by government agencies.8 Impact evaluations of the programs&#13;
are rare in Mexicoâ&#128;&#148;and are mostly qualitative and narrow in scope, measuring either beneficiary&#13;
satisfaction with support services or easily quantified program coverage indicators. The World&#13;
Bank study found positive and significant impact for firms participating in a few of the programs&#13;
(a 5 percent increase in value added in one case and a 6 percent increase in employment, among&#13;
other outcomes).&#13;
&#13;
Technology extension programs for the agricultural sector appear to face similar&#13;
challenges. These programs, largely sponsored by SAGARPA, present gaps in monitoring and&#13;
evaluation, which weaken the focus on results and accountability. In addition, they could make a&#13;
more efficient use of state based agricultural foundations that have successfully taken off during&#13;
the last decade.&#13;
Along with these basic innovation programs for small and medium-size enterprises, the&#13;
Mexican government has supported R&amp;D, though funding has been low and needs to be&#13;
reoriented to better respond to Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s development needs. CONACYT has been the&#13;
primary institution financing advanced human capital and research and, since the mid-2000s,&#13;
technology transfer (that is, commercialization of research). Other public institutions, most&#13;
importantly Pemex, also have research funds. Overall public funding for R&amp;D has been low&#13;
compared with countries with similar GDP per capita. A substantial share of funding is allocated&#13;
to the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores, which prevented brain drain in the 1980s but rewards&#13;
researchers on an individual basis for publications, which does not facilitate todayâ&#128;&#153;s needs for&#13;
multidisciplinary research or favor collaboration with industry or commercialization of research.&#13;
CONACYTâ&#128;&#153;s public research centers, a valuable pillar of Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s technological infrastructure,&#13;
could also work more closely with industry, and more of their resources could come from&#13;
competitive funding, rather than direct budgetary transfers. More than 15 sectoral funds were&#13;
jointly created by CONACYT and other federal institutions. Most resources were thinly spread&#13;
among funds, and little information is available on outcomes.&#13;
A few initiatives encourage technology transfer and R&amp;D-related innovation by private&#13;
firms. For example, CONACYT established Proinnova and several other programs to encourage&#13;
public-private collaborative research. The 2009 amendments to the Law of Science and&#13;
Technology seek to improve intellectual property rights of researchers at CONACYTâ&#128;&#153;s public&#13;
research centers. The current challenge is to create the capabilities and a culture within&#13;
CONACYTâ&#128;&#153;s centers for greater technology transfer activities to take root.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Federal initiatives to promote innovation at the subnational level have not yielded all the&#13;
desired results due to lack of capacity. Recognizing that opportunities and needs differ across&#13;
states, CONACYT has developed initiatives (such as mixed funds and regional funds) to foster&#13;
science and technology at the subnational level. Jalisco and Nuevo Leon, for example, have&#13;
actively used these funds to support their innovation strategies. Government officials in Jalisco&#13;
have involved multiple statekholders in the design of the strategy and committed public&#13;
resources to it. Among others, the strategy seeks to encourage greater industry-university&#13;
collaboration, and supports pre-competitive research funding, investments in research&#13;
infrastructure and human capital. Many of the interventions are targeted at addressing gaps that&#13;
are specific to key local clusters (e.g., skills in the rapidly growing software sectors, quality gaps&#13;
in traditional industries). Many other states have yet to formulate a clear vision of how science&#13;
and technology can contribute to their development agenda and have not been able to use the&#13;
mixed funds as effectively. Similarly, proposals submitted to the regional funds have been&#13;
suboptimal.&#13;
                                         POLICY OPTIONS&#13;
&#13;
Enhancing policymaking coordination and governance&#13;
&#13;
Given the multisectoral nature of innovation and multiplicity of programs, better&#13;
coordination in policymaking, stronger mechanisms to define budgetary priorities for&#13;
innovation, and greater coherence and synergies among public policy interventions are&#13;
necessary. A comprehensive strategy developed by a high-level council could be a useful tool to&#13;
help coordinate policymaking and guide budgetary decisions as many other countries committed&#13;
to innovation (e.g. Finland since the early 1990s) have shown.&#13;
Several options are available to formulate such a strategy. The General Council of Scientific&#13;
Research and Technology, headed by the president and entrusted with developing the six-year&#13;
Science, Technology and Innovation Program, could be responsible for it. Previous programs&#13;
emphasized building Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s scientific and technological capacities but overlooked broader&#13;
innovation challenges. The council requires a broader mandate and nongovernmental members&#13;
who are innovation experts. Another option is the Innovation Committee, headed by the Ministry&#13;
of Economy, but it might not have enough seniority to lead a national policy. Alternatively, the&#13;
president could form and lead a new high-level council with representatives from relevant&#13;
ministries.&#13;
&#13;
The National Innovation Strategy will be effective only if the council remains an active&#13;
policymaking body as other international experiences such as Finland have shown. It would&#13;
need to define budgetary priorities for innovation annually and ensure that rigorous impact&#13;
evaluations inform its decision making. A secretariat (for example, in the Ministry of Economy)&#13;
would also be needed.&#13;
Enhancing firmsâ&#128;&#153; absorptive capacity and linking them to Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s technological base&#13;
&#13;
Consolidating small and medium-size enterprise support programs and greater efforts at&#13;
evaluation should be priorities. Effectively implementing well targeted technology extension&#13;
services is crucial for Mexican firms, particularly small and medium-size ones, to move into&#13;

&#13;
higher value added activities. The countryâ&#128;&#153;s huge array of programs suggests that Mexico needs&#13;
a more coherent framework to orient resources more strategically and avoid program overlap.&#13;
The lack of information on budgets, activities, and beneficiaries points to a need for better&#13;
consolidation of information on support for small and medium-size enterprises. Technology&#13;
extension programs targeted at small producers in the agricultural sector are equally critical.&#13;
Such programs could also benefit from stronger monitoring and evaluation mechanisms that&#13;
would inform program design. State-based agricultural foundations could be more actively&#13;
involved as intermediaries in these programs.&#13;
Much more collaboration between Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s research base and productive sector is needed.&#13;
Such collaborations are pervasive in all dynamic innovation systems, whether in Israel, Sweden,&#13;
or Taiwan (China). Technology transfer needs to become a higher priority, supported with&#13;
appropriate financing. Funding would have a market-enhancing purpose that develops missing&#13;
capacities (such as technology transfer offices) and addresses other market failures (such as&#13;
coordination). However, there is scope for integrating similar programsâ&#128;&#148;such as Innovatec,&#13;
Innovapyme, and the Innovation Technology Fundâ&#128;&#148;to reduce costs and confusion to users.&#13;
Programs such as Magnet in Israel and similar ones sponsored by Tekes in Finland could be&#13;
good reference points for collaborative programs.&#13;
&#13;
Stronger incentives for technology transfer at public research centers and universities are&#13;
also needed. A culture of collaboration with the private sectorâ&#128;&#148;as is prevalent in universities in&#13;
Israel, Taiwan (China), and the United Statesâ&#128;&#148;needs to be developed. Many universities in&#13;
Europe, such as Cambridge and Oxford, have successfully made such cultural transitions. To this&#13;
end, CONACYTâ&#128;&#153;s core funding allocation to its public research centers could incorporate&#13;
technology transfer activities as a performance parameter, career promotion for its researchers&#13;
could recognize patenting and other technology transfer activities. Such changes together with&#13;
the new rules on intellectual property management noted above could set an example for&#13;
universities in Mexico to follow. Similar changes in funding and incentives by public&#13;
technology institutes in Finland (e.g., VTT) and other OECD countries could be a model for&#13;
Mexico to consider.&#13;
Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s research base can be further expanded and strengthened. Every innovative&#13;
economy has benefited from a strong science and technology base. The objectives and impact of&#13;
the programs developed to foster research must be assessed. For example, little is known of the&#13;
impact of the more than 15 sectoral funds created during the last decade. Changes to programs&#13;
should encourage larger scale, collaborative, and multidisciplinary research that can resolve&#13;
more complex problems and should forge more international collaboration. CONACYTâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
research centers could use more competitive funding to continuously foster excellence.&#13;
Institutional funding of 25â&#128;&#147;35 percent is a common practice in OECD countries. The revised&#13;
funding model would pave the way for further collaboration with other research centers and the&#13;
private sector. A transition plan could make this possible. Finally, the Sistema Nacional de&#13;
Investigadores system could benefit from more participation of international evaluators, bringing&#13;
greater objectivity to the evaluation, as well as a study on potential system reforms.&#13;
Greater efforts should be made to enhance the statesâ&#128;&#153; capacities to formulate their own&#13;
innovation strategies so they can make better use of their resources and benefit from programs at&#13;
the federal level.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                 Mexico Policy Note 3&#13;
&#13;
Enhancing human resource management for innovation&#13;
A policy on human resources for innovation should be defined to address challenges faced&#13;
at each stage of human resources formation. The policy needs to improve the relevance and&#13;
quality of curriculum and teaching methods. Further efforts are needed to address the causes of&#13;
secondary school dropout and to enhance teaching quality. (For further discussion, see Mexico&#13;
Policy Note 4 on labor markets for inclusive growth). And mechanisms and standards for&#13;
evaluating the quality of universities need to be strengthened.&#13;
&#13;
Efforts to increase the formation of advanced human resources need to be sustained, with&#13;
attention to increasing the innovation systemâ&#128;&#153;s absorptive capacity. On the public sector side&#13;
this means increasing support for research centers, and on the private sector side it implies&#13;
boosting demand for innovation. For example, Finland and Israel show that university and&#13;
industry research consortia are effective in forming industry-connected human capital.&#13;
Enhancing the quality of graduate education in Mexico needs to go hand in hand with&#13;
graduate studentsâ&#128;&#153; participation in international programs. Mexican studentsâ&#128;&#153; participation&#13;
in international programs will bring global knowledge to Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s industry and public research&#13;
base. Greater exposure of domestic graduate programs to external assessments is also needed.&#13;
The certification process of these programs should be changed to allow for more international&#13;
participation. Moreover, the overall system would benefit from an external evaluation of its own&#13;
evaluation processes by an international independent panel formed ad hoc or through a formal&#13;
structure such as the European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education.&#13;
Integrating Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s innovation system globally and removing barriers to the demand for&#13;
innovation&#13;
&#13;
The rapidly growing body of international knowledge makes it imperative to connect&#13;
Mexico globally. This includes attracting international students to Mexico; encouraging&#13;
international research collaborations; and incorporating more international evaluators in large-&#13;
scale research programs, the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores, and Mexicoâ&#128;&#153;s system of&#13;
graduate programs.&#13;
&#13;
Enhancing the investment climate&#13;
&#13;
A stronger investment climateâ&#128;&#148;and in particular a more competitive business&#13;
environment and more flexible employment regulationsâ&#128;&#148;would increase firmsâ&#128;&#153; demand&#13;
for innovation. A more competitive telecommunications sector would favor expanded Internet&#13;
services and lower connectivity costs, facilitating smaller business integration into more&#13;
productive activities.&#13;

            Fostering innovation for productivity and competitiveness

        <abstracts>
            This note provides a medium-term agenda
            for supporting Mexico's competitiveness by fostering
            greater innovation. Globalization and the dynamism of
            economies that compete with Mexico, particularly those in
            East Asia, bring a renewed urgency to Mexico's
            innovation policy agenda. While the firm is at the center of
            innovation, empirical evidence shows that public policy can
            generate an external environment more conducive to
            innovation. The past decade has brought several policy
            changes and new programs, but further changes will help the
            country catch up with more innovative economies and move up
            the value chain. Given the multi sectoral nature of
            innovation and multiplicity of programs, better coordination
            in policymaking, stronger mechanisms to define budgetary
            priorities for innovation, and greater coherence and
            synergies among public policy interventions are necessary. A
            comprehensive innovation strategy as used in highly
            innovative economies such as Finland can help guide such efforts.
