&#13;
&#13;
     MR. BLACK:    Gentlemen" the first item of business is our&#13;
&#13;
report and recommendations on the loan to the Japanese&#13;
&#13;
Development Bank in an amount equivalent to $8 milllon for the&#13;
&#13;
Kawasakl Steel Corporation's Second Blast Furnace Project.&#13;
&#13;
     I would like to calIon, first" Mro \,:uandt.&#13;
&#13;
     MR. QUANDT:   The loan under consideration" if approved"&#13;
&#13;
will be the Bank's ninth loan to Japan and lts first loan in&#13;
&#13;
Japan to finance part of the local expenditure required for a&#13;
&#13;
productive project instead of being limited to cover the&#13;
&#13;
foreign exchange needed to pay for imported equipment.&#13;
&#13;
     It will be recalled that {vIr. Black on return from his&#13;
&#13;
journey to Japan, on l\'lay 28, 1957, informed the members of the&#13;
&#13;
Board that the Japanese Government approached him with the&#13;
&#13;
question whether the Bank would f:tnd it possible to extend&#13;
&#13;
more loans to Japan or to increase the aggregate amount of&#13;
&#13;
loans which the Bank had in mind when it first began to opera t&#13;
&#13;
in Japan.   J.Vf.r. Black informed the Japanese Government that he&#13;
&#13;
would be willing to recommend to the Executive Directors addiÂ­&#13;
&#13;
tional loans and that he would expect the Japanese Government&#13;
&#13;
to present projects alming at easing the prlncipal bottlenecks&#13;
&#13;
of Japanese economic development, mainly :tn the field of&#13;
&#13;
transportation, power generation and industrial expansion"&#13;
&#13;
notably in the field of the steel and iron industry.&#13;
&#13;
     On October 17 the Executive Directors had been informed&#13;
&amp;#12;11&#13;
&#13;
I                                                                       4&#13;
&#13;
I&#13;
        that, during the Bank's Annual Meeting, the Japanese Finance&#13;
        Minister presented to the Bank Japan's program for external&#13;
        borrowing during the following three or four years and sugÂ­&#13;
        gested projects for the Bank's consideration in the fields of&#13;
        power, transportation and private industry which might involve&#13;
        loans in the order of magnitude of $300 million.     The Finance&#13;
        Minister also requested the Bank to carry out this program&#13;
,! without provoking inflationary pressures, rather than limiting&#13;
II&#13;
        its contribution to cover1.ng import requirements.    Mr. Black&#13;
I 
informed&#13;
I&#13;
                 the Japanese Finance Minister that the total external&#13;
    I   borrowing program of Japan seemed reasonable, but that he did&#13;
    I&#13;
Ii not wish to enter into any understanding about a definite pro-&#13;
&#13;
'I gram of loanso       It was made clear to the Japanese Finance&#13;
iI:l    Minister that the Bank would be prepared to review particular&#13;
        projects to ascertain whether they were technically and ecoÂ­&#13;
II! nomically sound and also to consider the proposal to finance&#13;
        such part of the local currency expenditures as could not be&#13;
        provided out of Japanese resources provided that the Bank's&#13;
        share was kept within reasonable proportions of the total&#13;
&#13;
II investment.&#13;
I'&#13;
       The Japanese Government          had presented to the Bank six&#13;
 I&#13;
 I hydroelectric projects, four         projects for the expansion of       I&#13;
 I&#13;
        iron and steel mills and one project for a highway to be con-       I&#13;
        structed between the cities of Nagoya and Kobe in the most&#13;
&#13;
        industrialized area of Japan.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      5
&#13;
&#13;
          The hydroelectric projects have been reviewed by a&#13;
&#13;
     mission during the last two months of the past year and the&#13;
&#13;
     appraisa~of   the individual projects are in preparation.&#13;
          A mission to examine three steel projects and another&#13;
     mission to discuss with the Japanese authorities the fundaÂ­&#13;
     mental problems of the requirements of Japanese transportation&#13;
     left for Japan a few days ago.&#13;
          Of all the projects, the Kawasaki steel project was the&#13;
     most advanced for active conSideration mainly because the Bank&#13;
     practically a year ago, has made a loan for another Kawasaki&#13;
     project and during the period of examination of the previous&#13;
 I&#13;
 I&#13;
&#13;
 i   project and since the time the first loan was made, has main-&#13;
 I tained such close relations with the Corporation as enabled th&#13;
II&#13;
')   Bank's staff to appraise the merits of the new project without&#13;
II&#13;
     an examination on the spot.&#13;
Ii&#13;
II        An appraisal of the technical, economic   a~d   financial&#13;
                                                     !s&#13;
     merits of the Kawasaki blast furnace project   ~     given in the     r '&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     technical report before the Executive Directors.     The staff of&#13;
     the Bank is convinced that the project is good from every poin&#13;
     of view and is completely reassured in respect of the capabili&#13;
     of Kawasaki's management and of the competent and loyal&#13;
     cooperation of the Japan Development Bank.&#13;
          There are one or two aspects of this proposed loan which&#13;
     should be mentioned especially.&#13;
         While a little over a year ago, before the first loan to&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                             6
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           Kawasaki was made, we found that a number of protective&#13;
&#13;
Ii         measures for Kawasaki in respect of its then existing debts&#13;
II and further assurances of standby and underwriting arrangement&#13;
'I&#13;
           were necessary, we now propose to release some of these pro-&#13;
I::!:,,!&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           tective measures and to restore the creditors into their right&#13;
           and thus Kawasaki's credit standing.&#13;
               When examining the previous loan proposal we found that,&#13;
           while the project itself responded to all technical and&#13;
           economic requirements, Kawasaki in its previous modernization&#13;
&#13;
           and expansion program, had relied to a considerable extent on /'&#13;
           short and medium term credit, a   considera:~:;   part of which        :~&#13;
           would have fallen due for payment during the construction              I&#13;
Ii         period of the previous project.   This circumstance could have&#13;
:!         impaired the execution of the project and could have developed&#13;
           into a potential source of serious embarrassment, had the&#13;
    i&#13;
11&#13;
II 	 creditors chosen to exercise their rights.         Since the project&#13;
           was good and its prospects promising and the Bank had full&#13;
           confidence in the management of Kawasaki, a reorganization of&#13;
           the financial structure of Kawasaki and a series of protective&#13;
           measures seemed to be the answer to the question.&#13;
                Over the last year and one-quarter Kawasaki's financial&#13;
           position has shown a remarkable improvement and the new invest&#13;
           ment promises to be very profitable.   We thus feel confident&#13;
           that Kawasaki's earnings estimated even on the most conservaÂ­&#13;
           tive basis will be sufficient to enable Kawasaki to meet its&#13;
&amp;#12;    II 	                                                                           7&#13;
    'I&#13;
     I obligations     without the aid of these protective measures.&#13;
           Therefore, upon request of Kawasaki and the other Japanese&#13;
&#13;
           parties concerned, we now suggest the elimination of the subÂ­&#13;
                     ~;t~.\.t)t&#13;
           ordination ~ possible deferment of the rescheduled capital                    ~&#13;
&#13;
           payments on Kawasaki fS so-called        II   old II debts.   satisfactory&#13;
           arrangements for a transitory supply of working capital by&#13;
           Kawasakifs principal bank have been made and that bank will&#13;
&#13;
           continue to stand by in respect of Kawasakifs short-term debts&#13;
           if they were not renewable and in regard to underwriting&#13;
&#13;
           renewal issues of mortgage bonds.&#13;
&#13;
                We recommend the approval of the proposal.&#13;
&#13;
     !          MR. BLACK:        Thank you, Sir.&#13;
     I&#13;
     I&#13;
                Mr. Tolley.&#13;
    II&#13;
                MR. TOLIEY:       Mr. Chairman, gentlemen, the "Memorandum on&#13;
    I&#13;
    . 	Recent Economic and Financial Developments in Japan," which&#13;
    II,'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
it 	 has been circulated to the Board, covers the major developmentt&#13;
'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Ii during the past eight or nine months.                       I would like to mention&#13;
I	&#13;
II         however, one development which has taken place since this&#13;
&#13;
           Memorandum was prepared; that is, the signing last week of a&#13;
           reparations agreement between Japan and Indonesia.                The main&#13;
           provisions of this agreement, as reported in the press, are&#13;
           that Japan would make reparations payments to Indonesia of&#13;
           $400 million, of which $177 million would be paid by writing&#13;
           off the post-war trade debt owed to Japan by IndoneSia, and&#13;
&#13;
           $223 million would be paid over a number of years; under the&#13;
,I&#13;
II&#13;
1\&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    8&#13;
&#13;
      agreement also, Japan would make public and private loans to&#13;
      Indonesia amounting to $400 million over a period of years.&#13;
           With the signing of this agreement, the bulk of the repaÂ­&#13;
      rations claims have been settled.   Agreements with Burma and&#13;
      the Philippines were reached in 1955 and 1956.   The main claim.&#13;
      still outstanding is by Vietnam, and any settlement is likely&#13;
      to be considerably smaller than in the Indonesian case.&#13;
           The Indonesian agreement has two immediate effects ..&#13;
      the amount of Japan's external debt payable in goods is&#13;
      increased; and,secondly, the value of Japan's reported foreign&#13;
      exchange assets is reduced.&#13;
           Regarding the first pOint, in the report assessing the&#13;
      long-term outlook and creditworthiness of Japan, which was sub&#13;
, ~&#13;
      mitted to the Board last summer, allowance was made for the&#13;
  I   settlement of both the Indonesian and Vietnamese claims.     The&#13;
 I&#13;
 I signing of the agreement with Indonesia therefore has not&#13;
 I&#13;
   affected our conclusions with respect to creditworthiness.            I&#13;
           Regarding the writing off of the Indonesian trade balance~&#13;
II&#13;
 i which is essentially a bookkeeping transaction, Japan's total&#13;
il    foreign exchange assets at the end of December 1957 are esti-&#13;
II mated at approximately $1.2 billion..     After deducting the&#13;
 I Indonesian balance    they would be just over $1.0 billion, which&#13;
      is about one-third of annual imports at the current rate.&#13;
           Of more importance to the Bank, however, is the progress&#13;
&#13;
      which Japan has made toward improving its balance of payments&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     9&#13;
&#13;
     since the adoption of the so-called tight money policy last&#13;
&#13;
     summer.&#13;
          In the months that have passed since then, total domestic&#13;
     demand has been restrained; wholesale prices have ceased their&#13;
     upward trend and have declined slightly; and industrial produc&#13;
     tion has leveled off.    At the same time, the balance of payÂ­&#13;
     ments has shown a marked improvement.    The drain on foreign&#13;
     exchange reserves was stopped by October, and during the last&#13;
     quarter of 1957 some $90 million were added to the reserves.&#13;
         While the improvement in the past several months has been&#13;
     as great and as rapid as could reasonably have been hoped for,&#13;
     further progress is still necessary in order to balance the&#13;
     international accounts at a higher, more adequate level than&#13;
     that reached in the last part of 1957.    The Government has&#13;
     planned to continue the tight money policy until this further&#13;
     progress is achieved.    However, opposition to this monetary&#13;
     policy has been increaslng, and it may not be feasible to main.&#13;
     tain the degree of stringency which has been imposed during&#13;
     the last few months.    Nevertheless there is no indication of&#13;
     a weakening of the Government's determination to attain the&#13;
     necessary improvement in the balance of payments as soon as&#13;
     possible.   Consequently, while some measure of compromise may&#13;
     be unavoidable, the basic policy is not likely to be altered&#13;
 I until the desired objectives are achieved.&#13;
 !&#13;
          Once these objectives are attained, there are good&#13;

&#13;
        prospects for a resumption of economic growth at a fairly&#13;
        rapid rate, with financial stability.      Thank you.&#13;
                MR. BLACK:   Thank you, sir.&#13;
&#13;
                Mr. Armstrong.&#13;
                MR. ARMSTRONG:   Mr. Chairman, gentlemen, it is a little&#13;
        over a year since the first Kawasaki project was submitted to&#13;
        the Board.     Since then, the Company has made remarkable proÂ­&#13;
        gress; and today there is every prospect that the strip mill&#13;
        project will be operating six months or more ahead of schedule&#13;
'I! and also that the cost of construction will be $1 million&#13;
&#13;
 I equivalent less than the original estimates.&#13;
 .              The Company has not only been successful in carrying out&#13;
li'l&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I	its&#13;
 I:.â&#128;¢&#13;
            construction program, its operations have also been&#13;
 I remarkably efficient and it has shared in the prosperity of&#13;
il the Japanese steel industry. The financial results achieved&#13;
I.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        have surpassed the conservative assumptions made at the time&#13;
        the first loan proposal was submitted to the Board.&#13;
                Since the spring of 1957, the tight money policy adopted&#13;
        by the Japanese Government has slowed business and prices of&#13;
        steel have fallen from the very high levels ruling early in&#13;
        1957.     But in the long run, the prospects of the industry are&#13;
 I	     good, and there is no reason to think that the present conÂ­&#13;
        struction program to increase the industry's capaCity is overÂ­&#13;
        optimistic.&#13;
                The project now under consideration will reduce the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                           11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       Company's relative dependence on imported scrap.         By   increasÂ­&#13;
       ing the proportion of molten iron fed to the steel furnaces,&#13;
       the project will add to their effective capacity and enable&#13;
       the Company to increase its output of finished steel without&#13;
       making any additional investments in steel-making and rolling&#13;
       facilities.&#13;
            The Japanese are experienced in the design, manufacture&#13;
       and installation of blast furnaces, which they can construct&#13;
       from their own resources more cheaply than if the eqUipment&#13;
       were imported.&#13;
            The Company's financial situation and prospects have&#13;
       improved materially since the first loan proposal was aub-&#13;
&#13;
I'&#13;
  I    mitted to the Board, and it is now proposed to simplify the&#13;
,I protective financial arrangements made in connection with the&#13;
Ii&#13;
 \1&#13;
II previous           Bank loan, and to eliminate some provisions no longer&#13;
&#13;
II felt to be necessary.&#13;
            In accordance with the wish expressed on a previous occaÂ­&#13;
       sion, the papers include a memorandum giving essential informa&#13;
       tion about the Japan Development Bank, which would be the&#13;
       borrower.&#13;
                                                                                i&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
            Taking all the factors into account, we have no          hesitati~&#13;
       in recommending this project as a basis for the proposed loan.&#13;
            fIIR ..   BLACK:   Thank you, sir.&#13;
&#13;
II          Are there any questions?         Mr. Lieftinck. 
&#13;
Ii:'        MR. LIEFTINCK:         I'd like to ask if any estimate has been 
&#13;
  I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 I&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                         12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     made of the expected foreign exchange savings of the project&#13;
&#13;
     when completed ..&#13;
          MR. ARMSTRONG:      This question is a little hard to answer&#13;
     in absolute amounts, because it depends on the relative fluctu&#13;
     ation in the prices of scrap and iron ore and coal.         Tney will&#13;
     have to import increased amounts of iron ore and coal.          '-lith&#13;
     the increased production, they will continue to import about&#13;
     the same amount of scrap.      Under the worst conditions, where&#13;
     the price of scrap is low, there will probably be no absolute&#13;
     foreign exchange saving.      Under the better condition, where&#13;
     the price of scrap is high, the Company will save approximatel&#13;
I    $5 million a year.      The most important feature of this is that&#13;
Ii   the operating efficiency gained by the use of the second blast&#13;
&#13;
     furnace will reduce the cost of steel making.       ,~, the"~Mt'(!iBg."&#13;
&#13;
:10&#13;
'i Â·ver   the assumptions made in the loan presentation of last                ~&#13;
&#13;
     year, there is for the Company an absolute saving of about&#13;
     $5 million in production costs, so that the project helps&#13;
     reduce the price of steel and will help them to improve their&#13;
     competitive pOSitIon both at home and abroad.&#13;
          MR. BLACK:      Mr. Hockin.&#13;
          MR .. HOCKIN:    Mr. Chairman, I am not entirely clear on the&#13;
     position of the Bank in connection with its assessment for the&#13;
     demand for steel in Japan in the perlod during which this new&#13;
     capacity will be effective.        I notice from Paragraph 60 of the&#13;
I    Operational Report -- I think that's on page 9 -- the&#13;
&amp;#12;.1&#13;
&#13;
II                                                                   13&#13;
I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       assessment suggests that, if everything is carried out along&#13;
       the lines of the Japanese Government's study, that there will&#13;
       in fact be what one might call excess capacity.   But the repor&#13;
       goes on to suggest that what would in fact be more likely to&#13;
       happen, since the industry's construction plans for the period&#13;
       will not all be finalized for some time to come, is that part&#13;
       of the expansion program would be postponed and the capacity&#13;
       envisaged in the Japanese study would be reached a year or two&#13;
       after 1962.   On the other hand, we hear that there is a Bank&#13;
       mission going out now, or is in fact in Japan, to study more&#13;
       steel projects as possible loan operations of the Bank; and I&#13;
  I couldn't quite put the two together. And I also noticed that&#13;
  I    the Japanese plans for reduction of the inflationary pressuresi&#13;
:1&#13;
Ii involved a request to private investors in various fields to&#13;
\!     cut down their investment programs.   And among the more&#13;
iIil   important industries that were referred to, we have steel, in&#13;
Ii&#13;
II which deferments of 12 per cent were asked in investment, and&#13;
1\&#13;
       which seemed to me to suggest the Japanese Government felt&#13;
       that this was a field in which deferment might be made, not&#13;
       just in terms of steel capacity but also because of the inflaÂ­&#13;
       tionary effect.   But presumably they singled out steel because&#13;
       they thought steel was a field in which deferment could useÂ­&#13;
       fully be made without affecting the economy at this time.     And&#13;
       the report expresses considerable amount of concern -- we have&#13;
       heard it from Mro Tolley, too -- about the possible revival of&#13;
&amp;#12;11&#13;
Ii                                                                    14&#13;
il&#13;
,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        inflationary pressures and the financial pressure that the&#13;
        Government was going to face, and expressed the hope that this&#13;
        would not be insuperable, that the Government would in fact be&#13;
        able to hold the line.     I wonder just what the Bank assessment&#13;
        was of the inflationary effects of -- well, take as an example&#13;
        this particular loan -- because in looking over the plans for&#13;
        the financing, other than the Bank loan itself, it seemed to&#13;
        me that there was a fair amount of short and medium-term&#13;
        credit involved in addition to the Bank loan.     And, of course,&#13;
        this Bank loan is not designed merely to cover foreign exchang&#13;
        costs either.     In other words, the Bank's money will be used&#13;
Ii&#13;
11      not just to import goods which would have no inflationary&#13;
i   l&#13;
Ii effect, but also specifically designed to cover some local&#13;
    I&#13;
    ,   costs as well, which, of course, does have considerable inflaÂ­&#13;
    I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        tionary effect.    So I wonder whether we could have just a&#13;
    ,&#13;
&#13;
    !   little more about the Bank's thinking on that subject, tooo&#13;
,I&#13;
                            We believe, sir, that the overall Japanese&#13;
I' 
&#13;
,I steel expansion program is in keeping with Japan's capabili-
&#13;
    I ties.       The three to four years program of Japan's investment&#13;
        program already presents a reduced program, and it had been&#13;
    I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        found last year that the roughly $1 billion equivalent progra&#13;
        for three to four years could be carried out and Japan could&#13;
        provide, out of its own resources, about 70 per cent of the&#13;
        amount.    That is why they asked the Bank to consider financing&#13;
        such part of the local investment as CQuld not be provided out&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                15 
&#13;
&#13;
of Japanese resources without imposing inflationary pressures.&#13;
&#13;
The Kawasaki program and, we believe, the rest of the three&#13;
other steel programs are already adjusted to the slowdown in&#13;
the progress of industrial development.    And we believe that&#13;
the increase of production by Kawasaki and by the other steel&#13;
&#13;
companies after the completion of their programs will not&#13;
&#13;
create undue unusable capacityo    In other words, that the&#13;
&#13;
Japanese industry will be able to absorb the blast production&#13;
of these companies, and particularly Kawasaki's project, but&#13;
the others as well.   And besides increasing production and&#13;
decreasing production costs, their competitive capacity both&#13;
in Japan and outside will improve, therefore supporting the&#13;
possibility of the sale of their excess production.&#13;
     As far as the financing of this project is concerned,&#13;
&#13;
Kawasaki, as you know, has successfully carried out a stock&#13;
&#13;
issue last summer ,""el!   ".lIt'" in the order of magnitude of        '"&#13;
the Bankts loano   Actual borrowing for the project itself&#13;
&#13;
amounts to   900 million yen from banks and insurance companies&#13;
&#13;
on medium term.  The short-term credits mentioned, which will&#13;
                                                  Ie ~ :&#13;
be given if necessary by Kawasaki's bank, the Dai ~ Bank,              X&#13;
are mainly standby credits to provide working capital for the&#13;
transitory period of the construction.    It is assumed that,&#13;
after the end of the construction, Kawasaki, within the usual&#13;
time, will be capable of repaying the extended credits which&#13;
as written in the technical report will be extended from five&#13;
&amp;#12;'I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                        16&#13;
&#13;
     to seven billion, and the five billion afterwards remaining&#13;
&#13;
     will also be a standby credit to be available if needed.           But&#13;
     these credits do not serve the actual purpose of construction.&#13;
     Now, they are only there to maintain Kawasaki's liquidity, if&#13;
     for any unforeseen events Kawasaki cannot generate the require&#13;
     cash out of its own operations.&#13;
           MR. BLACK:    Thank you.&#13;
           Any other questions?       Mr. Lieftinck.&#13;
           MR. LIEFTINCK:     Mr. Chairman, may I ask another question.&#13;
     In Paragraph   ~2   of the technical report, mention is made of th&#13;
      d:                       ~'~&#13;
     ~ap.Ul;tJ;..:t:zat'1on   laws.   I'd like to knO'Il whe ther these laws If.&#13;
II are still in force in Japan and whether they also exclude&#13;
II export cartels.&#13;
I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           ~'lF~\:is~~~       The basis of my information is that these&#13;
&#13;
     laws have had their effect and are not now in force, to the&#13;
     best of my information.&#13;
&#13;
           MR. BLACK:    Any other questions?&#13;
           MR. CALLAGHAN:     Mr. Chairman, there is one matter I think&#13;
&#13;
     to which we might direct attention ;trin a little detail.           On ~&#13;
     its face, we are lending $8 million to a (:~~t;~/that last yea x&#13;
&#13;
     made gross operating profits of $25 million, a net profit last&#13;
     year of about $6 million, and in recent years has had an up-&#13;
     and-down position described in Annex 4, by the way, to the&#13;
     technical report.      Now, of itself, the fact that the Company&#13;
     is profitable, of course, should not be a barrier to any&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       17&#13;
&#13;
    lending -- quite an encouraging position altogether -- but as&#13;
&#13;
    the Bank has many opportunities for lending, it is perhaps&#13;
&#13;
    something to which we might direct attention before we approve&#13;
    the loan.&#13;
           In the Paragraphs 60 or thereabouts to 70-odd of the&#13;
&#13;
    Annual Operations Report, particularly in Paragraph 68, we hav&#13;
    a statement of the way in which the Company proposes to meet&#13;
    its requirements, of which only $30 million, equivalent to&#13;
&#13;
    eight billion yen, is shown as from retained earnings.       Could&#13;
    we just have some comments by the staff on the examination&#13;
&#13;
    which they have given to the Company's proposals, and&#13;
&#13;
    ticularly the apparent profitability of the Company?&#13;
&#13;
    been any consideration given to any limitation in distribution&#13;
&#13;
    of earnings?&#13;
&#13;
           MR. ARMSTRONG:    The Company's financial position has been&#13;
    investigated quite thoroughly, and there is a limitation on&#13;
&#13;
    the distribution of earnings if the current ratiO would be&#13;
&#13;
    impaired.      They have changed the provision somewhat from the&#13;
j&#13;
i&#13;
I 	loan of last year, wheI'e they could not make a cash distribuÂ­&#13;
    tion durIng the construction period of' the project.     The:i.r&#13;
    financ ial post tion has improved cons iderably during the t tj_me,&#13;
    and   ~Te   feel now that the prospects are such that it is no&#13;
    longer necessary to prohibit during the construction period a&#13;
    distribution of dividends.      But the limitation comes if the&#13;
&#13;
    current ratiO is impaired below 1.8.&#13;
&amp;#12;              MR. BLACK:         All right, thank you.&#13;
&#13;
 il           Any other ques tions?&#13;
&#13;
              If there are no further questions, I'd l:i.ke to advise the&#13;
&#13;
      Board that        \~hree   New York banks" the Grace National Bank, the&#13;
&#13;

      are expected to participate in this loan, in the f:trst three&#13;
&#13;
      matur:i.ties totaling $734,,000.            11/e have fixed the new rate to&#13;

      the banks.         "1'e have reduced the rate because we have reduced&#13;
