  Project development objective&#13;
&#13;
  The overall objective o f the Project is to minimize the threat posed to humans and the poultry industry by&#13;
 the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) infection and other zoonoses, by enhancing both animal&#13;
  and human health infectious disease response and control capacities. To achieve this, three areas will be&#13;
  supported by the project: (i)prevention, (ii)preparedness and planning; and (iii)response and&#13;
  containment. Achieving these goals will contribute to diminishing the burden o f disease and loss o f&#13;
  productivity, limiting the regional spread o f HPAI, and enhancing economic and social prospects at the&#13;
  national, regional, and global levels.&#13;
 Project description[Details can befound in Appendices 2 and 2a]&#13;
&#13;
  Inaddition to the Bank and government co-financing described below, various other international&#13;
  organizations-including      the European Commission(EC), World Health Organization(WHO), United&#13;
  States Agency for InternationalDevelopment (USAID), UnitedNations Children's Fund(UNICEF)-are&#13;
  active in assisting the Government o f Bosnia and Herzegovina to address the threat o f Avian Influenza.&#13;
  The Project has been designed in close cooperation with these organizations to leverage the maximum&#13;
  financing possible and to avoid duplication o f efforts. The complementary activities o f these&#13;
  organizations are briefly explained below. However, the exact levels o f financing of these donor activities&#13;
  is not presented, as this i s not considered direct cofinancing o f the Bank-funded project (in all&#13;
 descriptions, IDA totalplus the Counterpart Financing (CF) is equal to total Componentjnancing).&#13;
&#13;
 Component 1: Strategic Communications and Public Information - US $0.20 million&#13;
&#13;
     Financing                                                         IDA Credit Proceeds&#13;

&#13;
 It is of critical importance that all sectors o f society are properly informed about the risks from HPAI, in&#13;
 order that proper protective measures can be taken, and, as importantly, to reduce the risk o f unwarranted&#13;
 fear about the disease (e.g., unnecessarily reducing consumption o f poultry products). This component&#13;
 would provide support for a broad range o f information and communication activities, to increase the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
attention and commitment o f government, private sector, and civil society organizations, and to raise&#13;
awareness, knowledge and understanding among the general population about the risk and potential&#13;
impact o f the disease. Implementation o f the first phase o f the communications strategy has already been&#13;
completed, through UNICEF's Sarajevo office. Bank financing would implement subsequent phases.&#13;

&#13;
The most effective way to reduce the threat from HPA, to both the economic sustainability o f domestic&#13;
poultry production and human health is to prevent the disease from establishing itself in domestic poultry.&#13;
This component would support implementation o f disease prevention and control strategies at national and&#13;
entity levels to address short, medium and long-term needs. Areas for support are based on detailed&#13;
assessments o f (i)the epidemiological status o f HPAI in Bosnia-Herzegovina; (ii)the capacity o f the&#13;
State Veterinary Office (SVO) to cope with a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) epidemic,&#13;
including surveillance and diagnostic capacity at the national and entity levels; and (iii)the vulnerability&#13;
o f the poultry industry to newly emerging infectious diseases.&#13;
&#13;
Implementationo f the Animal Health component will be assisted by the EC's Twinning Arrangement&#13;
(financed by the Government o f the Federal Republic o f Germany) with the SVO to provide technical&#13;
assistance on institutional aspects o f the veterinary sector, particularly in food safety, inspections, and&#13;
support to laboratories. The EC will also finance a feasibility study on large-scale animal waste disposal&#13;

&#13;
At present, there have been no human cases o f HPAI infection reported in BiH. However, it is likely that&#13;
at some point in the future, suspected or confirmed cases will occur, and rapid and coordinated&#13;
interventions will be necessary. Under this component, the project will (a) help enhance the coordination&#13;
and planning o f human health related activities, (b) strengthen the capacity o f investigation teams and&#13;
virology laboratories in both entities, (c) help BiH rapidlyjoin the European Influenza Surveillance&#13;
Network, (d) help develop the capacity of hospitals to adequately and safely isolate and treat (suspected)&#13;
human cases and, (e) finance the procurement o f seasonal flu vaccines and anti-viral drugs. Particular&#13;
attention will be paid to capacity building and the training o f staff at the various levels o f the health&#13;
system. This component contains support to the Ministryo f Civil Affairs at the State level, to enhance&#13;
their capacity to fulfill their mandate to coordinate human health policy and response for all of Bosnia-&#13;
Herzegovina.&#13;
&#13;
One o f the most crucial activities for preparedness in the Human Health sector is the finalization o f a&#13;
National Contingency Plan (CP), which integrates the CPs already prepared by each Entity. Most&#13;
importantly the National CP will define a clear `Chain o f Command' in the event o f a large-scale outbreak&#13;
affecting human health. WHO is leading this effort, through a series o f workshops undertaken in June&#13;
2006. The final CP, integratingthe two Entity-level plans has been completed, and is awaiting&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
parliamentary ratification; the AIPP will provide financingfor operationalizationofthis plan. WHO has&#13;
also recently completed an assessment of laboratories throughout BiH, which will form the basis for the&#13;
technicalplanningfor the upgrade of laboratories under the Project.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, WHO, with EC support, is working to strengthenthe overall surveillancesystem for seasonal&#13;
flu, which will also helpwith faster identificationof any unusual flu strains which might arise.&#13;

&#13;
Experience from world HPAI outbreaks has clearly shown that individuals are more likely to report sick&#13;
animals if they have credible assurances from government that they will be compensated inthe event that&#13;
their animals must be killed to prevent further spread of disease. Therefore, in order to provide sufficient&#13;
incentive for early reporting by citizens of sick animals, and hence timely response by government&#13;
authorities, within this component funds for compensation will be provided. As evidenced by the&#13;
experience from the culling campaign (that followed the AI occurrence in wild birds in February 2006),&#13;
the compensation procedure prescribed and elaborated in the CP for AI ensures timely, efficient and&#13;
transparent compensation paymentto farmers.&#13;

&#13;
One of the key characteristics of the HPAI threat is the difficulty in predicting the course the pandemic&#13;
will take. An important feature of the project, therefore, will be the flexibility to adapt to a changing&#13;
situation with the ability to reallocate funds between components and categories, and possibly draw up&#13;
new activities. The component would support costs associatedwith projectmanagement and coordination.&#13;
It would comprise two sub-components: (i)ImplementationSupport to the Technical Support Group inthe&#13;
Ministry of ForeignTrade and EconomicRelations;and (ii) Monitoring and Evaluation(M&amp;E).&#13;

A.       STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE&#13;
&#13;
1.       Country and Sector Backgroundand Global, Regionaland National Dimensions&#13;
&#13;
(a)      Country and Sector Background&#13;
&#13;
1.       Bosnia and Herzegovina has made remarkable progress in post-conflict reconstruction, social&#13;
integration and state building since the end of the 1992-95 war. However, the economy stands at only&#13;
70% of its prewar level. The business environment is not as investor-friendly as it needs to be to attract&#13;
the levels of investment required for sustained economic growth.            Some 50% of the 4.1 million&#13;
population is at or near the poverty level. The lack of employment opportunities is a major factor limiting&#13;
the resettlementof refugeesand internally displaced persons.&#13;
&#13;
2.       The composition of GDP appears to have changed markedly in the post-war period. According to&#13;
official statistics, the share of agriculture has declined significantly while the share of services has&#13;
increased.    While the overall trends follow a similar direction in both entities, there are notable&#13;
differences. The primary production sector (agriculture, fisheries and forestry) has remained an important&#13;
sector in Republika Srpska (RS) at 20 percent of GDP, but has dropped to less than 10 percent in the&#13;
Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBIH). Agricultural Gross Domestic Product (AGDP) makes up&#13;
about 14% of the country's overall GDP. It is estimated that 18% of the population is employed in&#13;
agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
3.       The poultry industry represents one of the main agriculture sub sectors, and production currently&#13;
falls just short of meeting the national market demand for its products. It is estimated that BIH has&#13;
around 32 million broilers (estimated annual production capacity), 1 million laying hens, and&#13;
approximately 1 million animals raised in back yards. Annual production capacity for the industry is 10&#13;
kg of meat and 120 eggs per capita (annual consumption in BiH is 14 kg of poultry meat and 180 eggs per&#13;
capita). The total annual production of poultry meat for 2004 is estimated at approximately 43,000 tons,&#13;
and for the same year production of eggs was around 450 million. Average market price for poultry meat&#13;
i s US$2 per kg, and the price of an egg i s US$O.O8. Commercial poultry farming is largely organized as&#13;
industrial production, primarily involved in the production of eggs and fresh/frozen chicken meat and&#13;
processed meat products. The commercial poultry plants are enclosed operations which use modern&#13;
equipment and technologies. Other poultry are raised on small household farms limited to a few chickens&#13;
and/or other domestic birds.&#13;
&#13;
(b)      International Dimension&#13;
&#13;
4.       East Asia is the region most affected by HPAI to date, with Cambodia, China, Indonesia,&#13;
Thailand, and Vietnam all reporting human infections. The number of countries affected by HPAI in East&#13;
Asia has increased and now includes Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Japan, Lao PDR, Mongolia, South&#13;
Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam. The geographical spread of HPAI, the human dimension and the potential&#13;
enormous social and economic impact are unprecedented. Despite control measures the disease continues&#13;
to spread, causing further economic losses and threatening the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of poor&#13;
livestock farmers, jeopardizing smallholder entrepreneurship and commercial poultry production, and&#13;
seriously impeding regional and international trade, and market opportunities. With outbreaks rapidly&#13;
spreading in other regions such as Europe and Central Asia (ECA) and Africa, there is a growing&#13;
realization that the international community faces several transnational challenges that do not emanate&#13;
directly from the policies o f individual states. Correspondingly, these challenges cannot be countered&#13;
solely by the actions of individual states, because they present a threat to the entire world. An important&#13;
emerging transnational threat is the spread of infectious diseases across national borders, which has the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
potential to undermine countries' stability, security, economic development, human capital accumulation,&#13;
and not least, the welfare o f the population.&#13;
&#13;
(e)     Regional and National Dimension&#13;
&#13;
5.      Until recently, avian flu outbreaks were limited to Southeast Asia. In July 2005, outbreaks were&#13;
registered in domestic poultry and fowl in seven regions o f Russia. Four months later, outbreaks in&#13;
poultry o f HPAI H5N1were reported in four regions o f Kazakhstan. Since 2005, outbreaks o f avian flu&#13;
have occurred in many countries outside East Asia.               After crossing from China into Russia and&#13;
Kazakhstan, outbreaks were reported in Albania, Azerbaijan, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria,&#13;
Cyprus, Croatia, France, Greece, Germany, Italy, India, Iran, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, Switzerland,&#13;
Turkey, and Ukraine. Seasonal migration o f birds contributes to transmission o f new strain variations to&#13;
different geographical regions. In October 2005, H5Nl was reported among migrating swans in Croatia,&#13;
which lies on the northern border o f Bosnia and Herzegovina.&#13;
&#13;
6.   On February 16, 2006, four swans from Pliva Lake in Jajce Municipality were brought to the&#13;
Reference Laboratory o f the BiH State Veterinary Office (Poultry Center o f Sarajevo Veterinarian&#13;
Faculty) for testing. Two o f the four swans tested positive in preliminary serologic tests; necropsy&#13;
findings for these two swans indicated the presence o f AI. State authorities subsequently mounted a&#13;
coordinated and thorough response to what was in essence a real-time emergency simulation.                      The&#13;
preparation mission o f March/April2006 was presented with substantial detail on this response, and noted&#13;
that implementation o f the veterinary control measures elaborated in the Contingency Plans (CP) appear&#13;
to have successfully halted any further spread o f the infection. In particular, the CP's clear "chain o f&#13;
command" rules allowed local authorities to act with confidence. In addition, on March 9, 2006, a case o f&#13;
AI was confirmed in a rooster inthe municipality o f Bajina Basta (Serbia). As a consequence, the nearby&#13;
community o f Bratunac in BiH was declared an endangered area, and measures were instituted as&#13;
prescribed by the CP. The infection also appears to have been halted in this area. No new cases have&#13;
been reported since then.&#13;
&#13;
7.      The emergence o f outbreaks in neighboring countries has had a negative impact on both poultry&#13;
production and consumption in BIH. Based on data from large-scale traders, poultry consumption&#13;
appears to have fallen by about 30-40 percent after the recent cases emerged in Croatia and Romania.&#13;
Official production fell by more than 50% in mid-2006, with some o f the major producers almost fully&#13;
halting production'. The decline in production and consumption have been accompanied by a drop in&#13;
market prices o f about 10 percent, while farm-gate prices o f chicken declined from 2.3 KM/kgto 1.4 -&#13;
 1.5 KM/kg.&#13;

&#13;
2.      Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
&#13;
8.      HPAI control programs require a multi-disciplinary approach to integrate technical, social,&#13;
economic, political, policy, and regulatory issues in addressing a complex problem.                  Working in a&#13;
collaborative manner with other agencies (WHO, UNDP, UNICEF, EC, USAID), the Bank is well-placed&#13;
to apply the evidence and lessons learned from international best practice in the various regions to help&#13;
ensure that BiH's emergency preparedness plans and capacities are ready for the H P A I challenge. The&#13;
Bank has a strong comparative advantage in providing integrator skills and multi-sectoral perspectives,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I As poultry production needs to be plannedinsuch a way that 36 days old chickenare available daily, the&#13;
production chain cannot be stopped instantly. Therefore, the real extent ofthe reduction can be seen only with a&#13;
two-month delay, time required to completethe fullproduction cycle.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and in addressing the institutional dimensions of the response to such emergencies. It can also bring&#13;
extensive experience and skills in analyzingand addressingthe social and economic impact. Importantly,&#13;
the Bank has a long recordin BiH in bringingtogether the relevant ministries, government agencies, and&#13;
the donor community, and inhelpingensure high levelpolitical coordination.&#13;
&#13;
9.       Given the Bank's work with local and internationalpartners in BiH and at the international level&#13;
to address both preparedness and outbreaks and to assist with institutional assessments, the Bank can&#13;
assist Bosnia and Herzegovina in leveraging additional resources from other international and bilateral&#13;
agencies. In addition to its financial role, the technical assistance provided by the Bank has been&#13;
important in similar global or regional emergency situations such as SARS, Tsunami relief, and&#13;
HIV/AIDS. The Bank's national and regional support will be closely linked with the activities of FAO,&#13;
WHO, OIE and the EU, and the proposed project is fully consistent with, and draws heavily on the global&#13;
strategies proposedby FA0 and WHO.&#13;
&#13;
B.       PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
1.       Lending Instrument&#13;
&#13;
10.      The project is to be supported by a Credit from the InternationalDevelopmentAssociation (IDA)&#13;
of US$5 million equivalent. In addition, the Bank is working on helpingto mobilize additionalresources&#13;
from bilateral and international agencies. Activities under the IDA-financed project will complement&#13;
activities supported by other international partners and donor agencies (EC, UNDP, UNICEF, USAID,&#13;
and WHO) and help ensure the availability o f adequate resources to fund the priority investments and&#13;
technicalassistance which BIH has identifiedas critical needs in implementingits response to HPAI. The&#13;
Project is supported by the Bank-financed Global Program for Avian Influenza Control and Human&#13;
Pandemic Preparednessand Response(GPAI) approved by the Bank's Boardon February 9,2006.&#13;
&#13;
11.      As per the GPAI, a country will qualify for support under the GPAI when it demonstrates its&#13;
commitment and readiness to implement early detection and rapid response measures appropriate to the&#13;
specific country conditions. A country request for assistance would be eligible for financing under the&#13;
GPAIwhen it meetsthe following eligibility criteria:&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
12.      The joint BanWWHOAJNICEF pre-Appraisal mission o f MarcWApril 2006 made an assessment&#13;
o f the readiness o f BiH to proceed with a program of support under the GPAI. It concluded that BiH&#13;
meets the eligibility criteria as per (iii)above. The level o f commitment o f BIH is high: (i)a letter&#13;
requesting the Bank's assistance was received on February 24, 2006; (ii)draft assessment plans and&#13;
preparedness plans on the response to an avian influenza pandemic were prepared by the Government&#13;
prior to the appraisal mission; and (iii)appropriate implementation and monitoring arrangements have&#13;
been discussed and agreed.&#13;
&#13;
13.      ProjectCharacteristics. The financial assistance under the project will be provided as a Credit.&#13;
The Credit is being processed as an emergency investment operation usingprocedures under OP 8.50 -&#13;
Emergency Recover Loan (ERL), and it meets all applicable Bank policies, practices and standards as&#13;
discussed below.&#13;
&#13;
2.       ProjectDevelopmentObjectives&#13;
&#13;
 14.     The overall development objective is to minimize the threat posed to humans and the poultry&#13;
industry by HPAI infection and other zoonoses, by enhancing both animal and human health infectious&#13;
disease response and control capacities. To achieve this, three areas will be supported by the project: (i)&#13;
prevention, (ii)preparedness and planning; and (iii)response and containment.&#13;
&#13;
3.       ProjectComponents&#13;
&#13;
15.      The project would finance activities under five components: (i)Strategic Communications and&#13;
Public Information; (ii) Animal Health Protection, and Disease Prevention and Control; (iii)Human&#13;
Health Protection, and Disease Prevention and Control; (iv) Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme; and&#13;
(v) Implementation Support, and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E). Even though the activities are&#13;
organized by sectoral components, the project strongly endorses an integrated national plan that ensures&#13;
common objectives across sectors for dealing with the avian flu issue.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
16.      Building on the work initiated by the Entity Public Health Institutes with the support o f UNICEF,&#13;
several communications interventions will be financed, chief among them the further development and&#13;
implementation o f the already drafted communication strategy. The draft strategy includes, inter alia,&#13;
improved communications strategies between and across government agencies (National Communication&#13;
Plan); protocols for coordination of the outbreak and crisis communication for professionals&#13;
(veterinarians, human health medical personnel, inspections, civil protection, state border service, etc);&#13;
materials and targeted training for educators; capacity building in communication techniques for health&#13;
workers, teachers and media professionals; and, at the community level, awareness raising and&#13;
communication for behavior change activities through all appropriate communications channels. While it&#13;
is crucial that each sector involved in public awareness and communications work under an overall&#13;
strategy and broader framework, the actual implementation o f communication and public information&#13;
activities will necessarily be carried out sectorally with a core set o f common objectives (more details are&#13;
included in Annex 2A).       UNICEF took the lead role in implementation o f the first phase o f the&#13;
communications strategy, with financing from USAID in the amount o f US$0.21 million. IDA financing&#13;
would complement the planned UNICEFLJSAID interventions, especially after the first year of&#13;
implementation. Three sub-components are foreseen:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    14&#13;

17.     The most effective way to reduce the threat from HPAI to both economic sustainability of&#13;
domestic poultry production, and human health, is to prevent the disease from establishing itself in&#13;
domestic poultry. This component will provide support to the implementation of disease prevention and&#13;
control strategies established at national and entity levels to address short, medium and long-term needs.&#13;
Areas for support are based on detailed assessments of: (i) epidemiological status of HPAI in BIH; (ii)&#13;
                                                             the&#13;
the capacity of the State Veterinary Office (SVO) to cope with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)&#13;
epidemic, including surveillance and diagnostic capacity at the national and entity levels; and (iii)the&#13;
vulnerability of the poultry industry to new emerging infectious diseases.&#13;
&#13;
18.     The component would have four sub-components:&#13;
&#13;
        Enhancing HPAI prevention and preparedness capability;&#13;
    0   Strengthening of Veterinary Services, disease surveillance, diagnostic capacity and applied&#13;
        research;&#13;
    0   Strengthening HPAI control programs and outbreak containment plans as well as capacities to&#13;
        implement those plans; and&#13;
    0   Improving bio-security in poultry production and trade, and isolating its potentially adverse&#13;
        effects on other aspects of people's lives.&#13;
&#13;
19.     The European Commission is actively providing support to animal health objectives through a&#13;
twinning program with the SVO. This program is under implementation, initially during 2007-2009 to&#13;
support capacity building with the SVO in the areas of legislative reform, food safety, phytosanitary&#13;
regime, inspections, and laboratory upgrading.&#13;

20. '   Both Entities have developed contingency plans. With the aim to further improve planning and&#13;
coordination, the project will (a) help conduct simulation exercises, (b) support the revision of the plans&#13;
and (c) support the preparation of social distancing plans and clean-out plans for hospitals. The&#13;
surveillance system will be strengthened through: (i)the training and equipping of investigation teams,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(ii) the equipping of 1 virology laboratory in RS and two in the FBiH (one for virus typology in Sarajevo,&#13;
and one for virus identification in Mostar); and (iii)the strengthening of the communicable diseases&#13;
monitoring and reporting system. It is expected that all these efforts will result in BiH joining the&#13;
European Influenza Surveillance Network. To help reduce the risk of a genetic recombination/ mutation&#13;
of the virus, the project will support the immunization against seasonal influenza of populations at high&#13;
risk. The capacity of the health sector to adequately isolate and treat suspected or confirmed human cases&#13;
of avian flu will also be strengthened. Particular efforts will be made to train health staff at different&#13;
levels of the health system, improve their knowledge of infection control measures and facilitate the&#13;
adoption of the most appropriate attitudes and behaviors so they can both protect themselves and&#13;
effectively take care of their patients. The interventions supported under the Project will be based on&#13;
BIH's epidemiological and programmatic needs, and well-assessed options for meeting them. The&#13;
interventions will be grouped inthree sub-components:&#13;
&#13;
     0   Enhancing public health program planning and coordination;&#13;
     0   Strengthening of the national public health surveillance system; and&#13;
     0   Strengthening health system response capacity.&#13;
&#13;
21.      The European Commission (EC) has allocated US$l80,000 equivalent from its ongoing project,&#13;
being implemented with WHO support, to continue strengthening the surveillance systems in the human&#13;
health sector. In addition, for the period 2007-2009, the EC will contribute EUR 500,000 to strengthen&#13;
the overall human health laboratory system. This support will be complementary to the laboratory&#13;
upgrades provided under the AIPP.&#13;

22.      Experience from world HPAI outbreaks has clearly shown that individuals are more likely to&#13;
report sick animals ifthey have credible assurances from government that they will be compensated inthe&#13;
event that their animals must be killed to prevent further spread of disease. As evidenced by the&#13;
experience from the culling campaign that had followed AI occurrence inwild birds in February 2006, the&#13;
compensation procedure prescribed and elaborated in the CP for A I ensures timely, efficient and&#13;
transparent compensation payment to the farmers. The CP contains the necessary forms and instructions&#13;
for personnel and institutions involved in culling, and ensures reimbursement of the farmers within a&#13;
timeframe of 7-10 days post-animal depopulation. The only factor that can compromise the effectiveness&#13;
of the existing compensation procedure, and thereby decrease the incentive for farmers to participate in&#13;
A I control efforts, is the limited budget available for this purpose. Currently, compensation costs related&#13;
to animal disease outbreaks are covered from the emergency fund (entity level budgets). Compensation&#13;
costs on the scale of that needed for the A I outbreak.experienced in February 2006 can be easily covered&#13;
by the government. However, if AI would occur in an area close to large-scale poultry farms, the&#13;
available budget under the current culling arrangements would not come even close to covering the&#13;
resulting expenses. Therefore, in order to provide sufficient incentive for early reporting by owners of&#13;
sick animals, and hence enable a timely response by government authorities, funds for compensation will&#13;
be provided within this component. A mechanism for the mobilization of these funds will need to be&#13;
agreed as a condition of disbursement (under the Animal Health Component), as well as distribution of&#13;
the responsibility for repayment among national and entity governments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

23.      One of the key characteristics of the HPAI threat is the difficulty in predicting the course the&#13;
pandemic will take. An important feature of the project, therefore, will be the flexibility to adapt to a&#13;
changing situation with the ability to reallocate funds betweencomponents and categories, and potentially&#13;
to draw up new activities. The component would support costs associated with project management and&#13;
coordination. It would comprise two sub-components:&#13;
&#13;
     0   Implementation Support to the Technical Support Group and PIU/PCU&#13;
         Monitoring and Evaluation(M&amp;E).&#13;
&#13;
4.     LessonsLearned and Reflectedin the Project Design&#13;
&#13;
24.      Relevant lessons for the design of the proposed project have been drawn from implementation of&#13;
projects in the agricultural and health sectors in Bosnia and Herzegovina. They have also been drawn&#13;
from the design of previous World BanWIDA and FAO-supported emergency recovery projects. These&#13;
include the Vietnam Avian Influenza Emergency Recovery Project, which was the first Bank-financed&#13;
project in response to the Avian Influenza. In addition, lessons have been drawn from the design of the&#13;
Kyrgyz Republic A I project, which was the first country-specific project drawing from the GPAI, as well&#13;
as projects currently under implementation in Turkey, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, and Albania.&#13;
&#13;
25.      Lessons learned indicate that project success depends to a large extent on the speed of the&#13;
response provided. Particularly when dealing with smallholders' production systems, a speedy, efficient&#13;
and transparent distribution of suitable key inputs is clearly a major factor in limiting the impact of a&#13;
crisis and hastening recovery. A performance audit of some of the emergency projects supported by the&#13;
Bank in various regions drew the following general lessons: (i)emergency projects should avoid policy&#13;
conditionality; (ii)project design must be simple and take into account a realistic assessment of the&#13;
existing Borrower's capacity and other stakeholders capacity; (iii)a speedy project processing and&#13;
approval are crucial to provide a prompt response and a substantial contribution to project success;&#13;
(iv) procurement arrangements need to be flexible and should be finalized at an early stage;&#13;
(v) mitigation and prevention measures should be included in the design to minimize impacts of a&#13;
possible recurrence of the disaster; and (vi) realistic assessments should be made of counterparts'&#13;
absorption capacity, as well as o f the effective communications and coordination mechanisms among all&#13;
relevant stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
26.      The main recommendations arising from the first 18-month implementation period of the&#13;
Vietnam Avian InfluenzaEmergency Recovery Project are:&#13;
&#13;
     (a) Preparednessis a key factor. While Vietnam had a national strategy document to control avian&#13;
         influenza in the domestic poultry population, it was not clearly understood and shared by all&#13;
         relevant agencies and stakeholders, and some aspects of the response were lagging behind.&#13;
&#13;
     (b) A two-pronged strategy is recommended. This should include: (i)the control of avian&#13;
         influenza at the source in high-risk regions (through aggressive measures including culling,&#13;
         movement control and vaccination campaigns for poultry and ducks); and (ii)simultaneously&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    17&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        prepared short and medium-term measures to minimize the risks to humans and prepare for an&#13;
        eventual pandemic.&#13;
        High level government commitment is of the essence. For implementation arrangements, it is&#13;
        important to have a coordination structure that is empowered with multi-sectoral responsibilities,&#13;
        along with full-time project coordinators to implement activities in a "crisis situation".&#13;
        Moreover, this level o f coordination would foster effective integrated national response, including&#13;
        all technical ministries in charge o f agriculture/animal health and human health, as well as other&#13;
        relevant sectors, at the national and sub-national level, in case o f a human epidemic.&#13;
        HPAI Control Strategy and PreparednessPlans need to be linked to the broader agenda of&#13;
        regulatory and institutionalreforms. In particular, a revised "compensation framework" is an&#13;
        essential element to obtain real cooperation from affected stakeholders (farmers/producers) and to&#13;
        ensure the efficacy o f the surveillance and diagnosis mechanisms. Other long-term reforms&#13;
        include the restructuring o f the poultry industry and the development o f food safety regulations.&#13;
        Technical, scientific and operationalcapacity of the relevant participating agencies, and in&#13;
        particular National Veterinary Services, should be strengthened. The AI crisis highlighted&#13;
        several weaknesses in the animal health as well as public health services systems, including: poor&#13;
        surveillance at the local level, weak diagnostic capacity, lack o f epidemiological expertise and&#13;
        information system, and inadequate operating budget to bear the additional costs o f physical and&#13;
        human cost to contain the spread o f the disease.&#13;
        Control strategies must include awareness raising and public information campaigns. It is&#13;
        extremely important to raise awareness in the public and private sectors from the initial moments,&#13;
        and to strengthen effective coordination mechanisms for the implementation o f the necessary&#13;
        technical responses, involving the Government, the donor community, the private sector and the&#13;
        civil society.&#13;
&#13;
        Regional collaboration is critical. Attention should be given to support the integration o f each&#13;
        country to a regional and global framework for the control o f HPAI, and more broadly o f all&#13;
        trans-boundary animal diseases and other emerging infectious diseases, to increase cost-&#13;
        effectiveness and ensure the harmonization o f activities and responses.&#13;
&#13;
        Some important lessons learned from the response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic2 are incorporated&#13;
in the design o fthe proposed project. They include:    I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    e   The need for high level political commitment and leadership is key.&#13;
    0   A comprehensive multi-sectoral approach is needed.&#13;
    e   Monitoring and evaluation is critical in the scaling-up o f a national response.&#13;
    e   Stakeholders at the country and international levels, are important in dealing with the AI threat.&#13;
    0   Building a strong fiduciary architecture is essential.&#13;
&#13;
C.      IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
1.      PartnershipArrangements&#13;
&#13;
28,     The Bank and the international community can play a key role in the response to Avian Influenza,&#13;
especially at the country level where there is a need to develop an overall framework to guide national&#13;
action plans that can be the basis for government and donor support. Such a framework should address&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
both animal and public health aspects as well as economic impact. Many o f the investments needed to&#13;
address this disease are core public health and animal health functions that are considered "global public&#13;
goods", thus, necessitating a global and regional response with support from the international community.&#13;
Such partnership arrangements have been developed in BIH with the technical agencies as well as with&#13;
bilateral agencies. Several meetings were organized prior to and during appraisal to briefthe international&#13;
partners on the Bank's plans to work with the Government in the design of a country-specific project and&#13;
to confirm their interest in participating in the financing o f the project.&#13;
&#13;
29.     BIH is receiving support on the technical content of an Avian Influenza response from key&#13;
technical agencies. International agencies and donors have been active through a Task Force established&#13;
in BIH for coordinated support of AI. The European Commission (EC) has allocated US $180,000&#13;
equivalent from its ongoing project, being implemented with WHO support, to continue strengthening the&#13;
surveillance systems in the human health sector. In addition, the EC has allocated EUR 500,000 for the&#13;
2007-2009, to assist with provision o f biosafety equipment for human health laboratories and hospitals.&#13;
UNICEF has been working closely with the Inter-Sectoral Committee to design a draft communications&#13;
strategy. As importantly, UNICEF support for AI communications was funded by USAID in the amount&#13;
o f US $0.20 million. These activities are now nearly completed, and have delivered a wide range o f&#13;
communications tools to enhance the overall government response. UNDP has expressed its interest to&#13;
collaborate by making available US $100,000 to support AI activities. The aim o f the IDA-fundedProject&#13;
i s to support an integrated response to AI with all international partners contributing and supporting&#13;
BIH's preparedness and control program. Further work inthis regard will continue prior to effectiveness&#13;
and during implementation to ensure complementarity o f all such grant financing from international&#13;
partners.&#13;
&#13;
2.      Institutionaland ImplementationArrangements&#13;
&#13;
30.     Because o f the inter-sectoral nature o f this project and potential for an AI outbreak or human&#13;
pandemic that is national in scope, it is critical that both animal and human health experts, as well as&#13;
communications specialists, work together closely at national and entity levels to perform the day-to-day&#13;
tasks o f implementing the Project. Implementation o f the Project will be undertaken by a Technical&#13;
Support Group (TSG) consisting o f technical advisors who are representatives o f the State Veterinary&#13;
Office (SVO)3 in the Ministry o f Foreign Trade and Economic Relations, Ministry o f Civil Affairs, FBiH&#13;
and RS Ministries o f Agriculture (Veterinarian Services), FBiH and RS Ministries o f Health, and&#13;

3 1.    The representative o f SVO on the TSG will be a permanent civil servant and will serve as Project&#13;
Coordinator, reporting to the Minister o f MoFTER. The TSG will report to the Council o f Ministers&#13;
through MoFTER. The TSG government representatives will be responsible for coordinating with and&#13;
reporting to their relevant government departments, to guide and monitor implementation o f activities in&#13;
their respective areas. The TSG will be responsible for monitoring and evaluation, the preparation o f&#13;
annual work programs and budgets, preparation o f TORSand specifications for goods and works bidding&#13;
documents, and preparation o f quarterly and annual progress reports.&#13;
&#13;
32.     Procurement, financial management and financial reporting services for the project will be&#13;
provided by the PIU Forestry and Agriculture in Sarajevo, and by the Health Sector PCU in Banja Luka.&#13;
More details on the implementation arrangements are provided in Appendix 2c.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   SVO has the mandate to coordinate veterinary services on behalf ofthe Entity Ministriesof Agriculture, Water&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
33 .     Overall responsibility for overseeing and coordinating institutional and implementation&#13;
arrangements will be vested with the Minister o f Foreign Trade and Economic Relations (MoFTER) on&#13;
behalf o f Council o f minister^.^&#13;
&#13;
34.      At the cantonal and municipalities levels, implementation would be the direct responsibility of&#13;
each cantonal/municipal veterinary/health authority. Small coordination units should be established at the&#13;
local level comprising officials from healthheterinary services to work under the supervision and&#13;
guidance o f the entity ministries.&#13;
&#13;
35.      To facilitate the management and implementation o f the Project, a Project Operational Manual&#13;
(POM) satisfactory to the Association is to be prepared by the TSG as a Condition o f Effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
3.       Monitoringand Evaluation of OutcornesDtesults&#13;
&#13;
36.      M&amp;E activities related to the project will be the responsibilityo fTechnical Support Group (TSG)&#13;
supported by the PIU/PCU. These activities could be carried out by the regular staff o f the agencies (with&#13;
technical assistance from the project) or by contracting out these functions with specialized&#13;
agenciedinstitutes when appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
37.      Monitoring project progress and the achievement o f objectives will entail a process o f&#13;
continuously and systematically reviewing the various project implementation activities. The objectives&#13;
o f the M&amp;E activities are to: (i)measure input, output and outcome indicators (see Appendix 1); (ii)&#13;
provide information regularly on progress toward achieving results and facilitating reporting to the&#13;
government and IDA; (iii)    alert government authorities and the international partners to actual or potential&#13;
problems in implementation so that adjustments can be made; (iv) determine whether the relevant&#13;
stakeholders are responding as expected and intended by the project; (v) provide a process whereby the&#13;
implementation agencies can reflect and improve on their performance; and (vi) enable the project to&#13;
make necessary changes should the situation evolve.&#13;
&#13;
38.      The results of relevant M&amp;E activities will be reflected in the quarterly and annual progress&#13;
reports.    A section o f the progress reports will be devoted to issues identified during project&#13;
implementation and the strategies and actions to be taken to resolve such issues that affect progress.&#13;
&#13;
4.       Sustainability&#13;
&#13;
39.      Critical to the sustainability o f the Project will be the continuous ownership o f this initiative by&#13;
the various stakeholders, coupled with strong political support and the availability o f an adequate flow of&#13;
financial resources to carry out project activities. In addition, institutional sustainability would be ensured&#13;
by: (i)strengtheningo f programs to maintain public awareness o f the threat o f avian influenza and other&#13;
rapidly spreading infectious diseases; (ii)sustained surveillance and prevention and control activities,&#13;
particularly in high risk regions; (iii)strengthened country capacity to manage at national and local levels&#13;
the risk factors associated with the spread of avian influenza and other infectious diseases; and (iv)&#13;
effectiveness o f programs to control the spread o f avian influenza from birds to the general population.&#13;

PossibleControversialAspects&#13;
&#13;
40.      The Project will support the implementation o f immediate term responses to a global influenza&#13;
pandemic   -- the classic "social distancing measures"-- such as quarantine, bans on mass gatherings, and&#13;
travel restrictions that may be politically and socially controversial.    This means that dialogue and&#13;
compromises are needed among different stakeholders, backed by a well-designed communication&#13;
strategy. A high degree o f political commitment to preventing and controlling the spread o f infectious&#13;
diseases such as a global influenza pandemic would be needed for managing controversies that will&#13;
undoubtedly arise.&#13;
&#13;
6.       Credit Conditions&#13;
&#13;
41.      The key conditions needed to minimize the risksto the Project would be addressed by the country&#13;
meeting the eligibility requirements for entering the Global APL.          Specific provisions have been&#13;
developed to meet the standard requirements covering organizational and staffing arrangements, as well&#13;
management, procurement and financial management arrangements. These have been addressed during&#13;
appraisal and were confirmed prior to Negotiations. Conditions of Effectiveness for the project would&#13;
be: (a) Establishment by the Recipient o f the TSG in a manner and with the composition and terms o f&#13;
reference satisfactory to the Association; (b) The Annual Work Program for the first year o f the&#13;
implementation o f the Project, satisfactory to the Association, has been prepared and adopted by the&#13;

3, and 5; and (v) the opening o f Project Accounts (for the Federation o f Bosnia and Herzegovina, the&#13;
initial deposit is to be equivalent to US $0.02 million; for Republika Srpska, the initial deposit is to be&#13;
equivalent to US $0.015 million).&#13;
&#13;
43.      Financial Covenants. The Federation PIU in the Ministry o f Agriculture and the RS PCU&#13;
established in the Ministry o f Health will maintain financial management systems acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
The project financial statements, summary reports and the designated account will be audited by&#13;
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank on terms o f reference acceptable to the Bank. The annual&#13;
audited statements and audit report will be provided to the Bank within six months o f the end o f each&#13;
fiscal year.&#13;

D.      APPRAISAL SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
1.      EconomicAnalysis&#13;
&#13;
46.     The poultry industry in BH is relatively small.                  Overall 2004 production amounted to&#13;
24.5 million kilograms. Of that, about half is produced by large commercial poultry farmers and the rest&#13;
by individuals, mainly subsistence farmers (Table 1). Exports have been negligible, largely because o f&#13;
lack of veterinary certification.&#13;
&#13;
47.     Poultry accounts for a relatively small part of households' consumption. In 2004, overall&#13;
consumption o f poultry amounted to 38.2 million kilograms, domestic production meeting 64 percent o f&#13;
consumption needs and imports accounting for the rest. One-half o f imports originated from Croatia.&#13;
Overall poultry consumption amounted to about 1.3 percent o f GDP, 3 percent o f total food expenditures&#13;
and slightly over 1 percent o f overall household consumption. Together with the consumption o f eggs&#13;
and processed poultry products, consumption of poultry and poultry-related products amounted to about&#13;
KM350 million in 2004, equivalent to 2.6 percent o f GDP and 2.1 percent the overall household&#13;
consumption.&#13;

EconomicImpactAnalysis&#13;
&#13;
48.     The economic analysis considers the short-term financial benefits and costs o f the project and the&#13;
associated program under a with-project and without-project scenarios.                 The analysis should be&#13;
considered as setting only the lower bound on the potential economic benefits that would accrue. The&#13;
analysis does not attempt to quantify the costs and benefits preventingthe spread o f the virus to humans.&#13;
&#13;
49.     The analysis considers two events. One is sporadic outbreak o f disease, as occurred in early&#13;
2006, and the other is a catastrophic outbreak. Table 2 lists the key assumptions o f the analysis. The&#13;
probability o f a sporadic outbreak is assumed equal to 100 percent without a project, constant every year,&#13;
while the probability of a catastrophic outbreak is assumed to increase from 40 percent to 50 percent over&#13;
time.  Both the probabilities o f sporadic and catastrophic outbreaks are assumed to be smaller and&#13;
declining under the with-project scenario. Further, it is assumed that a sporadic outbreak will cause 5&#13;
percent o f poultry to perish, while a catastrophic event will result in a 25 percent death rate.&#13;

&#13;
50.      Under these assumptions, the Net Present Value (NPV) o f the project using a discount rate o f&#13;
10 percent is $0.3 million. The IRR for this project is unique and equal to 25 percent.&#13;
&#13;
5 1,     As indicated above, the project presents the lower bound o f benefits to society. The estimated&#13;
economic benefitswould be substantially larger ifthe costs and benefits o f averting human hospitalization&#13;
are taken into account. For example, were an outbreak o f avian flu to result in human infection, the cost&#13;
o f hospitalization and possibly death would be substantial.&#13;
&#13;
2.       Technical&#13;
&#13;
52.      Animal Health.        Successful implementation o f the project depends on a phased multi-&#13;
disciplinary strategy based on a sound epidemiological approach to control H P A I outbreaks.              This&#13;
strategy has to take into consideration the range o f epizootic and epidemiological scenarios that exist or&#13;
may arise in BiH, as well as the different poultry production systems within the country, and different&#13;
levels o f incidence (ranging from high incidence with variable flock outbreaks, through low frequency&#13;
disease outbreaks with partial flock immunity, to sporadic outbreaks).           A balanced combination o f&#13;
appropriate disease control options, tailored to the specific characteristics and needs o f BiH, i s therefore&#13;
essential for the achievement o f the project objectives.&#13;
&#13;
53.      Key technical issues being addressed by the project include: (i)    capacity o f the public and private&#13;
veterinary services; (ii)adequate regulatory and incentive framework (including sub-laws); (iii)&#13;
regulations and protocols in accordance with OIE standards and guidelines); (iv) adequate laboratory&#13;
facilities and staff capabilities; (v) harmonization o f disease information systems to improve BiH's&#13;
capacity to participate in the World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS) o f the OIE; (vi) bio-&#13;
security measures; (vii) minimizing contact between potential infected wild birds and domestic poultry;&#13;
and (viii) coordinating among public agencies and with the private sector to improve long-term planning&#13;
for infectious disease control.&#13;
&#13;
54.      Human Health. So far, no human HPAI cases in humans have been reported in BiH. However,&#13;
the existence o f free-ranging poultry in backyards and close contact between human and poultry put BiH&#13;
at relatively high risk o f transmission o f the virus to humans. The assessments carried out show that the&#13;
capacity o f the MOHs, Public Health Institutes (PHIS)and other stakeholders to: (i)rapidly and accurately&#13;
detect HPAI cases in humans; (ii)adequately isolate and treat suspected or confirmed cases o f AI in&#13;
humans; and (iii)protect from the AI virus and other communicable diseases both populations at high&#13;
risks and the general population is still relatively limited.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      24&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  55.     First, the chain o f command is insufficiently defined, which could lead to many problems and&#13;
 delays, even in case of a limited crisis. Second, while investigationteams do exist at the Entity level&#13;
 PHIs, and cantonal and regionalPHIs, their capacity to quickly and effectively investigateand respondto&#13;
  local outbreaks appearstoo limited. Third, althoughefforts are beingmade by both Entities,the ability of&#13;
 health services to effectively isolate and treat suspicious or confirmed AI human cases is at present&#13;
 extremely limited. This is even true at the level of tertiary hospitals, where appropriately organized and&#13;
 equipped isolationrooms do not exist at present. Fourth, the investigationteams as well as laboratory and&#13;
 medicalpersonnel lack protective equipment and clothingand the current stocks of antiviral drugs appear&#13;
 too limited. Fifth, health services will rapidly become unable to cope with an explosive increase of the&#13;
  number of patients.&#13;
&#13;
  56.     In such a context, priority needsto be given to: (i)the strengthening o fthe capacity of Entity and&#13;
  local investigation teams through training and the provision of necessary equipment, notably personal&#13;
 protective equipment; (ii)the creation of isolation rooms in hospitals, for effective isolation of the first&#13;
  cases of HPAI in humans; (iii) the training of health workers in infection control measures; and (iv) the&#13;
 preparation of plans to "clean out" hospitals in case o f a severe outbreak and the identification of&#13;
 culturally and socially appropriate social distancingmeasures in case of a pandemic. In parallel, actions&#13;
  should be taken to help: (a) strengthen the system for the surveillance of communicablediseases and help&#13;
 BIH become part o f the European Influenza Surveillance network; and (b) build-up adequate human&#13;
 microbiologyand virology laboratorycapacity in each Entity.&#13;
&#13;
 3.       Social&#13;
&#13;
  57.     Although there are several large and a number of medium-size commercial poultry producers,&#13;
, about 25% o fpoultry are kept by smallholders intheir backyards and managedby women with the help o f&#13;
 children. Such families are disproportionately likely to be inthe lower income quintiles.&#13;
&#13;
  58.     The central roles of women and children in managing backyard poultry have important&#13;
  implications for the project:&#13;
&#13;
          Given the involvement of children managing domestic birds (feeding, egg collection, herding&#13;
          geese and ducks, etc.), awareness and educational efforts need to ensure that children are&#13;
          effectively targeted and reached with appropriatelydesigned messages,through the schools.&#13;
     0    Reaching women with critical AI awareness messages and information will, similarly, require&#13;
          specific targeting and utilization of suitable dissemination and outreach channels. School-age&#13;
          childrencan bring leafletsto their mothers.&#13;
          In the event of culling, compensation will needto be providedto women owners, and the project&#13;
          will ensurethat mechanismsare in place to ensurethis.&#13;
&#13;
 4.       Fiduciary&#13;
&#13;
  59.     The financial management arrangements of the project are acceptable to the Bank. The overall&#13;
 FM risk for the project is moderate except for the Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme that is&#13;
 consideredto be highrisk. However adequate mitigationmeasuresand internal controls are requiredprior&#13;
 to the disbursementof funds and some of the key controls are includedbelow (appendix 5). The financial&#13;
 management arrangements of the Federation PIU in Ministry of Agriculture and the RS PCU established&#13;
 in the Ministry of Health have been assessed and continuously monitored as part of project supervision,&#13;
 and have been found to deliver high quality fiduciary services to the projects.They have both established&#13;
 and maintained good financial management system for the implementationof the Bank financedprojects.&#13;
 The financial management systems will be expanded to support the proposed project and additional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    25&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
expertise in financial management will be engaged and financed under this project. The internal control&#13;
and fund flow arrangements are yet to be finalized for the cash grants/Poultry Culling Compensation&#13;
Scheme component, but the basic control procedures for the existing compensation system for Avian&#13;
Influenza described in 2005 is a valuable basis for finalizing the procedures with the added complication&#13;
with additional sources of financing for the compensation from this project. The flow of funds under the&#13;
cash grantsPoultry Culling Compensation Scheme sub-component will only begin after appropriate&#13;
internalcontrol and fund flow procedureshave been documented in the financial manual that will be part&#13;
of the Project Operational Manual and after the Bank has assessed the internal control arrangements as&#13;
satisfactory. Appropriate flow of fund mechanisms is a condition of disbursement. Detailed financial&#13;
management arrangementsare described in Appendix 5.&#13;
&#13;
60.      Procurement. The capacity of the PIUPCU to conduct procurement under Bank guidelines has&#13;
been assessed as satisfactory under the Forestry/Agriculture and Health Projects, respectively..&#13;
Procurement functions will be strengthened by the recruitment of an additional procurement specialist to&#13;
be responsible for procurement under this project in the PIU and PCU. Activities to be financed from the&#13;
Credit shall be undertaken in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Bank "Guidelines -&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004 (the Procurement Guidelines).&#13;
Similarly, the selection and employment of consultants' services shall be governed by the "Guidelines:&#13;
Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004 (the Consultant&#13;
Guidelines). Details on procurement arrangements are provided in Annex 4. The procurement plan will&#13;
be finalized during Appraisal.&#13;
&#13;
5.       Environment&#13;
&#13;
Environmental assessment             Environmental Category                       PI&#13;
&#13;
61.      The two safeguard issues which pertain to the Project are those of environmental assessment for&#13;
methods to be deployed for disposal of culled poultry and of mitigating the negative impacts of mandated&#13;
culling of poultry on small scale backyard poultry producers. A delay in the completion and disclosure of&#13;
the Environmental Assessment from the normal appraisal stage has been approved, instead making this a&#13;
condition of disbursement for Component 2 - Animal Health, and Component 3 - Human Health. The&#13;
draft EMP has been completed, with the public consultation held on July 20, 2006 in Sarajevo. Following&#13;
this, the EMP was finalized in end-September 2006. Nevertheless,prior to Effectiveness, evidence of the&#13;
adoption of the EMP by the Recipient and each Entity needs to be provided to the Association.&#13;
Activities under the proposed project are not expected to generate any significant adverse environmental&#13;
effect, as a large part of the project is geared to support prevention activities. Overall, the project would&#13;
have positive environmental and social impacts. The primary potential environmental risks can be&#13;
grouped into three categories:&#13;
&#13;
    (a) Inadvertent human exposure and spread of the virus due to: improper culling and disposal of dead&#13;
         birds (wild birds, sick and dead birds from backyard and commercial poultries); lack of, or&#13;
         improper use of personal protection equipment (PPE); improper disposal of farm waste (i.e.,&#13;
         bedding, manure, washings, etc. during and/or after an outbreak); and inadequate lab biosafety&#13;
         protocols.&#13;
&#13;
    (b) Inadvertent release of chemicals in the environment from unsatisfactory decontamination&#13;
         procedures (for personnel, poultry sheds, and transport vehicles, etc.).&#13;
&#13;
    (c) Release of chemicals and infectious agents into the environment from inadequate laboratory and&#13;
         medical facility waste management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    26&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
62.      Building capacity for collection and testing of Avian Influenza virus.              The Project's&#13;
investments in facilities, equipment, and training for laboratories will improve the effectiveness and&#13;
safety over existing avian influenza handling and testing procedures by meeting international standards&#13;
established by OIE. Upgrading for laboratories will include provision of appropriate facilities and training&#13;
for waste management and for bio-safety level 2 and 3 operations. Medical waste generated in health care&#13;
facilities will be managed using existing guidelines in BiH, which have been found satisfactory under&#13;
previous projects. The Project would also support updating these guidelines, training of health care&#13;
workers to manage medical waste following these guidelines, and, as appropriate, purchase of equipment&#13;
for the proper handling and disposal of medical waste in participating facilities. These provisions would&#13;
be included inthe Project Operational Manualto be prepared prior to effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
63.      Overall, the Project will assist the government to develop a strategy for managing future&#13;
emerging and re-emerging zoonotic and infectious diseases outbreaks. As such, the project would&#13;
improve environmental and social safeguards, in two areas: (i)mainstreaming environmental safeguards&#13;
into protocols and procedures for the culling and disposal of animals during an outbreak, in particular by&#13;
adopting OIE standards in these areas, and improving bio-medical waste management systems in health&#13;
facilities and laboratories; and (ii)development of policies on compensation for poultry farmers affected&#13;
by future outbreaks.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
64.      Since the Project is assessed as a B-category project, an Environmental Management Plan (EMP)&#13;
would be implemented with project support (see project components). The EMP addresses safe culling&#13;
practices, and disposal of carcasses, laboratory wastes, and medical waste. This EMP also covers the&#13;
clean up of animal wastes of culled poultry by the local public veterinary services and minor civil works&#13;
supportedunder the Project.&#13;
&#13;
7.       Policy Exceptions&amp; Readiness&#13;
&#13;
65.      The only policy exception requested has been with regard to the waiver of the completion of the&#13;
EA and EMP per para. 12 of OP 4.01. As noted above, evidence of the adoption of the EMP is a&#13;
condition for Effectiveness. The project meets the regional criteria for readinessfor implementation.&#13;

                                 Appendix 2a: Detailed Project Description&#13;
               BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA: Avian Influenza PreparednessProject&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.       The project would finance activities under five components: (i)Strategic communications and&#13;
public information; (ii)animal health protection and disease prevention and control; (iii)human health&#13;
protection and disease prevention and control; (iv) poultry culling compensation scheme; and (v)&#13;
implementation support, monitoring and evaluation.            It should be emphasized that even though the&#13;
activities are organized by sectoral components, the Project calls for, and strongly endorses an integrated&#13;
national plan that ensure common objectives across sectors for dealing with the threat of HPAI.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to the Bank and government co-financing described below, various other international&#13;
organizations -- including the European Commission (EC), World Health Organization (WHO), United&#13;
States Agency for International Development (USAID), UnitedNations Children's Fund (UNICEF) - are&#13;
active in assisting the Government o f Bosnia-Herzegovina to address the threat o f Avian Influenza. The&#13;
Project has been designed in close cooperation with these organizations, to leverage the maximum&#13;
financing possible, and to avoid duplication o f efforts. With the exception o f UNICEF, the exact level o f&#13;
financing o f these donor activities is not presented, as this is not considered direct cofinancing o f the&#13;
Bank-funded Project,&#13;
&#13;
COMPONENT1: STRATEGIC COMMUNICATION AND PUBLICINFORMATION                           -US$0.20 million&#13;
&#13;
 Financing                                                          IDA Credit Proceeds&#13;
 IDA Credit:            US$0.20 million                             FBiH:          US$O. 11 million&#13;
                                                                    RS             US$0.09 million&#13;
&#13;
2.       It is o f critical importance that all sectors o f society are properly informed about the risks from&#13;
HPAI, in order that proper protective measures can be taken, and, as importantly, to reduce the risk o f&#13;
unwarranted fear about the disease (e.g. unnecessarily reducing consumption o f poultry products). This&#13;
component would provide support for a broad range o f information and communication activities, to&#13;
increase the attention and commitment o f government, private sector, and civil society organizations, and&#13;
to raise awareness, knowledge and understanding among the general population about the risk and&#13;
potential impact o f the disease.&#13;
&#13;
3.       Building on the work initiated by the EntityPublic Health Institutes with the support o f UNICEF,&#13;
numerous communications interventions will be financed, chief among them the further development and&#13;
implementation o f the already drafted communication strategy. The draft strategy includes, inter alia:&#13;
improved communications strategies between and across government agencies (National Communication&#13;
Plan); protocols for coordination o f the outbreak and crisis communication for professionals&#13;
(veterinarians, human health doctors, inspections, civil protection, state border service, etc); materials and&#13;
targeted training for educators; capacity building in communication techniques for health workers,&#13;
teachers and media professionals; and, at the community level, awareness raising and communication for&#13;
behavior change activities through all appropriate communications channels. A local Communications&#13;
Specialist will be hired to work in the Technical Support Group to coordinate activities under this&#13;
component. He/she will be assisted by short-term consultants to be engaged as needed to address specific&#13;
communications issues. In order to assist with the above tasks, three types o f activities are being&#13;
considered for financing:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      39&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    0   Developing basic communication materials, including developing and testing messages and&#13;
        materials to be used inthe event of a pandemic or emerging infectious disease outbreak;&#13;
        Developing training courses in communications methodology for veterinary staff as well as for&#13;
        health workers at the cantonal and municipal levels; and&#13;
    0   Collaboration among stakeholders, including state level authorities such as the Ministry of&#13;
        Foreign Trade and Economic Relations, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Ministry of Security, as&#13;
        well as veterinary and public health authorities at the state, entity and municipality levels.&#13;
&#13;
A.      DevelopingBasic CommunicationMaterials&#13;
&#13;
4.      Activities to be supported would include developing and testing messages and materials to be&#13;
used in the event of a pandemic or emerging infectious disease outbreak, and further enhancing the&#13;
infrastructure to disseminate information at the state and local levels and between the public and private&#13;
sectors. Communication activities will support cost effective and sustainable methods such as marketing&#13;
of "handwashing" through various channels through the delivery of handwashing messages via mass&#13;
media, counseling, schools, etc. Communication materials would be integrated into Avian Flu specific&#13;
interventions as well as ongoing outreach activities of ministries and sectors, especially ministries of&#13;
health, education, agriculture, security and transport. Specifically, support would be provided for: (i)the&#13;
development and distribution of basic communication materials (such as question and answer sheets and&#13;
fact sheets) on influenza, influenza vaccine, antiviral agents, and other relevant topics; (ii)general&#13;
preventive measures such as "do's'' and "don't's" for the general public. Support would also be provided&#13;
for information and communication activities to increase the attention and commitment of government,&#13;
private sector, and civil society organizations, and to raise awareness, knowledge and understanding&#13;
among the general population about the risk and potential impact of the pandemic and to develop multi-&#13;
sectoral strategies to address it.&#13;
&#13;
B.      DevelopingTraining Courses in CommunicationsMethodology&#13;
&#13;
5.      This sub-component would support the development and implementation of training courses in&#13;
communications methodology for veterinary staff as well as health workers at the State and local levels.&#13;
It will include the preparation and dissemination of information materials, and the provision of&#13;
communications and information equipment for use at the state and local levels. Specifically, support&#13;
would be provided for (i)information and guidelines for health care providers; (ii)training modules (web-&#13;
based, printed, and video); (iii)presentations, slide sets, videos, and documentaries; (iv) and symposia on&#13;
surveillance, treatment and prophylaxis. In addition, support would be provided to strengthen networks&#13;
of communication offices, as well as mechanisms to increase coordination and consistency of messages&#13;
among risk communication managers. Training would be provided under this sub-component for spoke-&#13;
persons from priority sectors in managing the media, partnering with the electronic and print media with a&#13;
view to highlighting the national response, as well as accurately reporting on the monitoring,&#13;
preparedness, containment and mitigation plans, as the case may be. The Ministry of Education and&#13;
relevant partners will participate inthe development of educational materials to be used in schools.&#13;
&#13;
C.      Collaborationwith Stakeholders&#13;
&#13;
6.      The multi-dimensional problems associated with HPAI infection necessitate collaboration from a&#13;
wide range of stakeholders within each country, which has to be supported by broad communications and&#13;
information campaigns to improve public awareness. The major stakeholders include various ministries&#13;
(Finance, Agriculture, Health, Transport, veterinary services, national research institutions and diagnostic&#13;
laboratories), NGOs and civil society organizations, private sector companies and associations (e.g. large&#13;
poultry producers, farmers' associations, veterinarians and farmer involvement at the grass roots level).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   40&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The sub-component would support activities designed to improve the effective coordination and&#13;
collaboration among these stakeholders.&#13;

    IDA Credit:                           US$2.46 million&#13;
&#13;
7.      The project would support a program to develop and implement HPAI prevention, containment,&#13;
control, and eradication activities in the livestock sector, specific to the needs o f BiH in the short, medium&#13;
and longer term. These activities reflect an assessment o f the particular risks, conditions, constraints,&#13;
needs and possibilities in the country, including a rapid assessment o f the veterinary services.&#13;
Government contribution to this Component will consist primarily in o f consumables (e.g. personal&#13;
protective equipment and supplies), minor goods, running costs o f various reporting systems, and in-kind&#13;
staff costs.&#13;
&#13;
A.      EnhancingHPAI Preparednessand PreventionCapability (US $0.31 million)&#13;
&#13;
8.      Al: Strengthening the National Policy and Regulatory Environment. The project will&#13;
support activities aimed at improving the policy, legal and regulatory framework that governs the national&#13;
capability to implement the recommended disease detection, control, prevention, containment, and&#13;
eradication measures in a uniform and effective way and in accordance with OIE standards and&#13;
guidelines. The project includes support for a detailed review o f current policies and the existing legal&#13;
and regulatory environment and for the drafting, as may be warranted, o f legal amendments, regulations&#13;
and implementation guidelines and manuals. Staff o f the Ministries o f Agriculture, SVO, and other&#13;
concerned agencies will, in topical working groups and with support by international experts on&#13;
veterinary laws and regulations, review the relevant laws and regulations governing animal disease&#13;
control and will draft the necessary legislative amendments, regulations and implementation guidelines.&#13;
Particular emphasis will be placed on regulations concerning the control o f notifiable diseases, the&#13;
delineation o f the respective responsibilities o f the veterinary authorities, private veterinary service&#13;
providers and farm owners. Specific areas o f emphasis are:&#13;
    0   Development o f legislation establishing a national program for registration o f poultry farms.&#13;
        Data related to farm location, type o f production and capacity (number o f animals, production&#13;
        output) will be necessary for planning, implementation and evaluation o f AI preparedness and&#13;
        control activities. This information will also be necessary for efficient indemnification o f losses&#13;
        incurred from the destruction o f livestock.&#13;
    0   Development o f legislation regarding biosafety requirements/conditions                 necessary for&#13;
        establishing and maintaining poultry farms. The capacity of relevant agencies should be increased&#13;
        to provide extension services/education to producers in support o f biosafety requirements.&#13;
        Development o f legislation mandating surveillance activities. This legislative framework will&#13;
        need to incorporate equitable solutions for distributing costs and responsibilities for surveillance&#13;
        between government and producers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    41&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B.       Strengthening of Veterinary Services, Diagnostic Capacity, Applied Research, and Disease&#13;
Surveillance(US $2.3 million)&#13;
&#13;
9.       B1: Strengthening Veterinary Services and Diagnostic and Applied Research Capacity.&#13;
There are wide divergences in the capacities o f the individual animal health laboratories within the&#13;
country. None o f the laboratories have an appropriate biosafety environment for handling AI agents. The&#13;
short term goals for the system include developing appropriate capacities and biosafety levels (BSL) in&#13;
regional laboratories involved in routine monitoringlscreening for AI. An evaluation o f capacities and&#13;
procedures in existing laboratories, to include biosafety protocols, will precede the determination o f the&#13;
specific steps that will be required to develop laboratory capacities.&#13;
&#13;
10.      The longer-term goal is to upgrade all laboratories to at least Biosafety Level 2 and, depending on&#13;
the overall financing that becomes available, to establish one BSL 3 lab, which could handle not only&#13;
HPAI, but any other highly pathogenic organisms which need to be tested. Project financing will provide,&#13;
inter alia: civil works for rehabilitation and modernization o f the National Animal Health Laboratories&#13;
network (likely to focus on 5-7 labs); crucial diagnostic equipment; waste decontamination and disposal&#13;
equipment; refrigerators and microbiological cabinets; computers and software; and basic laboratory&#13;
furnishings. Additional support for laboratories would be provided under the proposed IDA-financed&#13;
Agriculture and Rural Development Project.&#13;
&#13;
11.      B2: Strengthening Animal Disease Information Systems. The effectiveness o f an AI control&#13;
program will dependent upon the establishment o f a well functioning surveillance system, fed by valid&#13;
data collected in the field.    This surveillance system should permit rational allocation o f resources,&#13;
creation o f alternative actions, and objective evaluation o f activities performed. Surveillance programs&#13;
should be differentiated between wild and domestic birds and further delineated within the domestic&#13;
population between free-range and commercial poultry. In order to achieve optimization o f surveillance&#13;
efforts, risk areas (wild bird habitat) must be expanded and a scientifically based sampling scheme must&#13;
be developed for domestic poultry.        This will require assistance in obtaining sampling equipment,&#13;
developing arrangements for sample transportation, obtaining personal protective equipment and training&#13;
local staff.&#13;
&#13;
12.      Support will be provided for basic equipment, training, surveillance, and integrated reporting&#13;
systems, for improved monitoring o f wild bird migration and "resting" points. This activity will be&#13;
coordinated with technical professionals from the biological sciences, with training focused on disease&#13;
recognition, safe handling o f potentially infected wild birds, and public communications.&#13;
&#13;
C.       StrengtheningHPAI Control and Outbreak Containment Capacity (US $0.30 million)&#13;
&#13;
13.      Project support will be made available for the implementation o f H P A I outbreak containment&#13;
actions, as set forth in the draft national action plan and to be further specified in the final plan and&#13;
associated implementation guidelines and manuals. The national action plan specifies the responsibilities&#13;
and functions o f a National Disease Crisis Coordination Center (NDCCC).                It also defines the&#13;
composition and responsibilities o f Local Disease Crisis Coordination Committees (LDCCCs) that will be&#13;
formed and trained now, and activated inany location where an outbreak is suspected andor confirmed.&#13;
&#13;
14.      The project will finance and support activities related to the implementation o f the plan,&#13;
including, inter alia, technical assistance and training for enhanced emergency response, outbreak control,&#13;
data collection and interpretation, early warning systems, and basic epidemiology, as well as equipment&#13;
such as personal protective equipment for field and laboratory epidemiological staff, culling equipment,&#13;
and disinfection sprayers.     In addition, a specific unit for epidemiological communications will be&#13;
established.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    42&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
D.       ImprovingBiosecurityin Poultry Production and Trade (US $0.07 million)&#13;
&#13;
15.      Support will be provided for a training program on farm biosecurity practices. This training will&#13;
be primarily oriented towards smallholder operations, as larger commercial farms generally have quite&#13;
good biosecurity. However, large operations will also be targeted, particularly where they are nearby to&#13;
significant poultry populations in "backyards".&#13;

&#13;
16.      This component would support a program to further plan and implement preparedness, and&#13;
improve surveillance and prevention as well as response and containment activities in the human health&#13;
sector in the short, medium and longer term.&#13;
&#13;
17.      On the basis o f the country's epidemiological needs and assessment of the particular conditions,&#13;
constraints, needs and possibilities in BiH, initial support under the project will concentrate on a few&#13;
essential areas. These will include the further refinement o f the contingency preparedness plans and the&#13;
establishment o f a clear chain o f command and coordination mechanisms, the rapid strengthening o f&#13;
capacities in intervention epidemiology (including simulation exercises), the expansion o f seasonal flu&#13;
vaccinations, and the strengthening o f the health sector capacity to isolate and adequately treat a few&#13;
suspected or confirmed cases o f AI in humans. In parallel, the project will help plan and support the&#13;
strengthening o f the surveillance system for communicable diseases and o f laboratory capacity as well as&#13;
o f the capacity o f the health sector to prevent the spread o f the AI virus among humans and to protect&#13;
groups at high risk. Finally the project would also support efforts to prepare for social distancing and&#13;
other interventions measures in case o f a pandemic.&#13;
&#13;
18.      Activities to be supported under the project would be grouped in three sub-components: (a)&#13;
enhancing public health program planning and coordination; (b) strengthening o f public health&#13;
surveillance system; and (c) strengthening health system response capacity. Government contribution to&#13;
this Component would consist primarily o f laboratory and hospital consumables (e.g. personal protective&#13;
equipment and supplies), minor goods, and in-kindstaff costs.&#13;
&#13;
A.       EnhancingPublic HealthProgramPlanningand Coordination (US $0.13 million)&#13;
&#13;
19.      Legal aspects regarding communicable diseases (including highly pathogenic infections) are&#13;
covered by the Laws on the protection of the population from infectious diseases, which were adopted in&#13;
1995 in RS and May 2005 in FBiH. Current institutional arrangements for addressing Avian Influenza in&#13;
Humans in BiHparallel the organization o f the health system and responsibilities lie with the entities.&#13;
&#13;
20.      Inthe past year, both Entities have made significant efforts to plan and coordinate activities. The&#13;
RS Preparedness Plan was adopted by the Government in October 2005. The FBiH "preparedness plan&#13;
for expected emergence o f the Pandemic Influenza" has been revised in February 2006, and has now been&#13;
approved by the Federation Government. In any case, these plans have now been superseded by the&#13;
creation o f a National Contingency Plan, produced through a series o f multi-stakeholder workshops&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   43&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
sponsored by WHO. The National CP contains clear chain o f command and individual responsibilities&#13;
and (b) the measures to ensure coordination between stakeholders working on animal and human health in&#13;
MOHs and between MOHsAPHS and other actors within the health sector. The National CP i s not yet&#13;
formally ratified by the full BiH Parliament; this is expected to be completed by mid-2007. The sub-&#13;
component would support the following three activities:&#13;
&#13;
22.      Al: Refining Plans and Strengthening the Chain of Command. As noted, the WHO has&#13;
sponsored a series o f workshops which have led to an integrated National Contingency Plan (CP), which&#13;
addresses the shortcomings noted above. To help prepare all stakeholders to better cope with outbreaks&#13;
and ensure that individual responsibilities and procedures to be followed are well known, the project&#13;
would finance the conducting o f simulation exercises at the State, Entity and local levels, once the new&#13;
National CP is approved.&#13;
&#13;
23.      A2: Review and Amendments of Laws and Bylaws. The project would finance technical&#13;
support to review and prepare necessary amendments to current laws and bylaws. More specifically,&#13;
assistance will be given for the review and/or preparation of, inter alia: (i)statutory provisions regarding&#13;
quarantine laws and how they apply in a public health emergency, (ii)laws and procedures for closing&#13;
businesses and schools and suspending public meetings during a declared state o f emergency, (iii)&#13;
medical volunteer licensure, liability and compensation for retired and non medical volunteers; and (iv)&#13;
worker's compensation laws as they apply to heath care and other essential workers.&#13;
&#13;
24.      A3:     Social Distancing.      The project would support the development o f a detailed&#13;
implementation plan for so-called "social distancing" measures to be activated in case o f an epidemic.&#13;
Social distancing measures will typically be activated on advice from health professionals and&#13;
institutions, although they will not be the enforcing agencies.          The implementation plan will have&#13;
therefore to explicitly define institutional responsibilities for activation and enforcement o f social&#13;
distancing measures and for inter-agency and inter-ministerial coordination.          Training will also be&#13;
provided to "enforcement agents" such as the police and military in safe, efficient implementation o f&#13;
social distancing measures in ways that do not induce panic. Additional preventive actions that will&#13;
complement social distancing (such as personal hygiene promotion through various communication&#13;
channels, including hand-washing and proper cooking, and distribution and use o f masks) will also be&#13;
supported.&#13;
&#13;
25.      A4: Clean Out Plans for Hospitals (Preparing for Coping with Severe Outbreaks and a&#13;
Pandemic). The project will also support the preparation o f plans and measures to be implemented in&#13;
case o f larger outbreaks or a pandemic. While a full-scale pandemic will rapidly overwhelm hospital&#13;
capacity, there is a need to prepare hospital "clean-out'' plans to help create a buffer for localized&#13;
outbreaks. Specifically, the project will support the preparation o f plans to reorganize and clean out&#13;
infectious clinics and other departments in hospitals to make them able to cope with an increase o f&#13;
suspected or confirmed AI cases. The plans will necessarily include measures to evacuate hospitals o f non&#13;
acute cases through, for instance, the canceling o f elective procedures or finding alternative&#13;
accommodation for non-emergency admissions.&#13;
&#13;
B.       StrengtheningNational Public Health Surveillance Systems (US $0.95 million)&#13;
&#13;
26.      At this point in time, there is no national surveillance system for communicable diseases. The&#13;
surveillance systems in place at the Entity level are based on routine health facilities reports for 62&#13;
diseases, which are compiled and analyzed by the hygiene and epidemiological departments o f the IPHs'.&#13;
&#13;
'See the WHO report titled "assessment ofthe national surveillancesystemfor communicable diseases" and dated&#13;
September2004. A new assessment of the national laboratory capacity will be conductedby WHO inJune 2006.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   44&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Except in the case o f suspected or confirmed outbreaks, reports are sent weekly to the intermediary level&#13;
(regional or cantonal PHIS) and monthly to the Entity level. No specific surveillance system i s in place&#13;
for influenza and influenza-like (ILI) illness and BiH is not part o f the European Influenza Surveillance&#13;
network.&#13;
&#13;
27.      Investigationand response teams exist at the Entity level (2 in RS in Banja Luka and Doboj and 1&#13;
in FBiH) and additional capacity can be mobilized at regional or cantonal level. These teams, however,&#13;
lack protective personal equipment, spraying devices and disinfectant.            Efforts to train staff in&#13;
intervention epidemiology have already started and recently (2005), 24 epidemiologists attended the&#13;
EPIET course organized by WHO with EU financial support. However, there is an obvious need to&#13;
further build-up capacity in intervention epidemiology and to train and/or retrain investigation and&#13;
response teams.&#13;
&#13;
28.      There i s no national or Entity Influenza Laboratory and or no capacity in the health sector for&#13;
typing and sub-typingo f influenza virus strains. As indicated in the 2004 report on laboratory capacity in&#13;
BiH6,the capacity o f existing microbiology and virology laboratories need to be significantly improved&#13;
before the country can be considered to have an effective communicable diseases surveillance system.&#13;
Basic facilities and good expertise exists in the country. However, the existing laboratory capacity is&#13;
highly fragmented and the lack o f training and investment in the past 15 years have left the laboratories&#13;
operating at a level far below EU standards and the minimum bio-safety level 2 required for manipulating&#13;
highly pathogenic viruses. Three interventions are planned.&#13;
&#13;
29.      B1: Improvementof Capacity in InterventionEpidemiology. The project will first strengthen&#13;
the capacity to investigate and respond to outbreaks, including: (a) investigation and collection o f&#13;
specimens in areas where AI in birds or poultry are reported, (b) safely and rapidly transport o f specimens&#13;
to laboratories (including to the UK reference laboratory) for diagnostic testing and virus sub-typing and&#13;
confirmation o f results and, (c) outbreak investigation and containment measures in areas with suspected&#13;
or confirmed human cases. To this end and building on activities supported by WHO (with financing&#13;
from EC), the project will support the Public Health Institute and regional/cantonal epidemiological&#13;
investigation and response teams through: (a) the re-training o f staff, (b) the provision o f personal&#13;
protective gears and other equipment and consumables (sprayers, disinfectants), the provision o f materials&#13;
and bio-safety boxes for the collection and transport o f samples and, (c) communications equipment.&#13;
&#13;
30.      B2: Strengthening the Surveillance of Influenza and Communicable Diseases. In parallel&#13;
with activities listed in B 1 above, the project will complement the EU/WHO current efforts and pilot&#13;
project aiming at the strengthening o f the communicable diseases surveillance system. In particular, the&#13;
project will provide part o f the necessary IT equipment (computers, servers, software) and will contribute&#13;
to the building o f capacity for reporting and analysis o f epidemiological data.       In this framework,&#13;
particular attention will have to be paid to the active surveillance o f influenza with a view to help BIH&#13;
rapidlyjoin the European Influenza Surveillance network.&#13;
&#13;
31.      B3: Strengthening the Laboratory Capacity. The project will contribute to building the&#13;
laboratory capacity and network.       More specifically, the project will contribute to efforts towards&#13;
upgrading two laboratories (1 in each Entity) to bio-safety level 2 and make them able to type and sub-&#13;
type influenza virus strains. In addition, the Project will assist with upgradingthe laboratory in the PHI in&#13;
Mostar, to enable it to provide virus identification capacity. To this end, the project will finance part of&#13;
the necessary studies, limited civil works and equipment as well as kits, reagents and other consumables&#13;
and personal protective equipment (PPE) for laboratory staff. The project will also finance training and&#13;

equipment and incinerators for the management and disposal o f contaminated lab materials.&#13;
&#13;
C.        StrengtheningHealth Care ResponseCapacity (US $0.9 million)&#13;
&#13;
32.       At this point in time, the BIH health sy,stem appears relatively unprepared to immediately and&#13;
adequately respond to even a limited outbreak, not talking o f coping with a pandemic. Seasonal influenza&#13;
vaccination remains limited and MOHs have only very limited stocks o f anti-viral drugs (only 400 and&#13;
1000 antiviral treatments are available in respectively RS and the FBiH).&#13;
&#13;
33.       While the hospitals where the first AI suspected or confirmed human cases would be hospitalized&#13;
have been identified, these facilities are not ready to appropriately and safely taking care o f highly&#13;
infectious patients. Isolation rooms need to be established and properly equipped and health workers&#13;
from these facilities need to be trained or re-trained in many areas and to be provided with personal&#13;
protective equipment. Three types o f intervention are proposed:&#13;
&#13;
34.       C1: EmergencyMeasures. Under the project, assistance will rapidly be provided to ensure that&#13;
optimal medical care to AI suspected or confirmed human cases can be offered and to provide essential&#13;
services to the community in case o f a pandemic. Towards this aim, the project will provide support for&#13;
the: (a) establishment o f isolation capacity in the hospitals and infectious clinics that have been already&#13;
identified (Banja Luka and Foca for RS; Sarajevo and Tuzla for the FBiH); (b) equipment o f the isolation&#13;
rooms; (c) emergency stocks o f medicines and consumables, (d) protective equipment for health workers&#13;
and; (e) training and retraining o f staff. In addition, an enhanced triage capacity will be supported for the&#13;
Clinical Center in Mostar.&#13;
&#13;
35.       In case o f a declared influenza pandemic, this sub-component will finance emergency imports&#13;
identified as necessary under a well-defined preparedness and response program to be prepared as part o f&#13;
project implementation. These imports are likely to include: (i)pharmaceuticals and vaccines, (ii)&#13;
medical supplies and equipment, (iii)communication equipment, supplies and information campaigns,&#13;
(iv) food and water containers, and (v) protective clothing. Particular attention will be paid to the&#13;
definition o f measures towards the protection o f health care workers and to ensure that they will be&#13;
willing and can continue to be at work in a pandemic situation (including protection and compensation&#13;
measures for the risks involved).&#13;
&#13;
36.       C2: Vaccination. This sub-component will help expand regular seasonal flu vaccination for&#13;
targeted priority groups' (as defined in the contingency plan). In view o f financial constraints as well as&#13;
the anticipated limited quantities o f seasonal flu vaccines available on the international market, the project&#13;
will more specifically focus on the immunization o f the most at risk populations (poultry farmers and&#13;
veterinarians) and o f health care workers. It would also finance the development o f a detailed logistical&#13;
(procurement and distribution) plan for mass vaccination should an HPAIvaccine become available.&#13;
&#13;
37.       C3: Anti-Viral Drugs: Under this sub-component, the project will finance the stockpiling on&#13;
anti-viral drugs (Oseltamivir or others). It is plan to help increase buffer stocks o f Tamiflu up to 3000&#13;
treatments for the Federation and to 1000 treatments for RS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7 Including poultry farmers, veterinarians, health staff and persons with chronic disorders of the pulmonary and&#13;
cardio-vascularsystems andor chronic metabolic and immunologic disorders. To all the extent possible, vaccines&#13;
will also be provided for the immunization of children below 5 and persons over 65 years of age&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
38.      Early detection and reporting as well as rapid response depend critically on the incentives for&#13;
poultry owners to report very quickly any sick and dead poultry to their veterinarians. Without adequate&#13;
compensation arrangements in place, poultry owners have no incentive to do so, but must fear that their&#13;
animals will be destroyed and they lose this valuable capital.&#13;
&#13;
39.      The June 2002 Veterinary Law in BiH confirms the right o f farmers to compensation for the&#13;
elimination o f contagious animals, and determines the procedures for culling and compensation. The value&#13;
o f culled animals is determined by Entity Veterinary Services, according to the damage appraisal list&#13;
prepared by the appraisal commission. In the case o f Avian Influenza, the commission also confirms the&#13;
number o f culled poultry. These procedures have been successfully employed for the recent outbreak o f&#13;
HPAI in Jajce and Jezero.&#13;
&#13;
40.      In the event of further HPAI outbreaks in BiH, the Project will provide support for culling and&#13;
elimination o f infected and at-risk poultry, with compensation to farmers and commercial poultry producers&#13;
based on the existing legal framework and the AI contingency plan.              The order for culling and&#13;
compensation will determine in advance the compensation value by type o f poultry (rather than requiring a&#13;
commission to determine the value on a case-by-case basis). Accurate lists will be kept o f all poultry&#13;
culled, so that the culling committee can calculate the compensation that will go to each poultry owner.&#13;
Strict requirements will apply to recording, reporting and verification o f poultry culling, compensation&#13;
claims and payments.&#13;
&#13;
41.      Bosnia-Herzegovina's current capacity to compensate farmers for culled animals will be&#13;
enhanced by the provision o f US $0.55 million from the Project. This will be split evenly between the&#13;
Entities, with each Entity provided matching funds o f US $0.1 million. Access to the Bank portion o f&#13;
these funds will be conditional on the modalities for operating the Fund being approved by IDA. Key&#13;
parameters guidingthis effort are provided in Appendix 2b.&#13;

&#13;
42.      This sub-component would support costs associated with project management and coordination,&#13;
including costs associated with the Technical Support Group to be established to support project&#13;
coordination and management, and costs associated with the PIU/PCU for procurement and financial&#13;
management services. An inter-sectoral Crisis Committee was established in November 2005 under the&#13;
chairmanship o f the Minister o f Foreign Trade and Economic Relations (MoFTER) to oversee the HPAI&#13;
control and containment effort and to provide general policies and guidance for avian influenza control.&#13;
This Committee will operate as needed in the event of further AI outbreaks to ensure coordination and&#13;
&#13;

linkages across relevant agencies and with international partners. Implementation arrangements are&#13;
discussed in Annex 2c below.&#13;
&#13;
B.       Monitoring and Evaluation(M&amp;E)&#13;
&#13;
43.      B1: Training. This sub-component would support training in monitoring and evaluation at all&#13;
administrative levels, mid-term evaluation workshop, and development of an action plan for M&amp;E and&#13;
replication of successful models. It would support the following activities:&#13;
         Training in M&amp;E;&#13;
    0    Implementation of baseline studies;&#13;
    0    Mid-Term evaluation of the project;&#13;
         On-going part'icipatory monitoring and evaluation; and&#13;
    0    Final project evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
44.      B2: ProjectMonitoring and Impact Evaluation.Support would be providedto develop project&#13;
monitoring and impact evaluation assessments. Two types of M&amp;Eare envisaged:&#13;
&#13;
45.      B2(i): Monitoring of project implementation. This is a function of the TSG, which would&#13;
collect relevant data from line ministries and other implementation agencies and then compile them into&#13;
quarterly progress reports focusing on status of physical implementation by component, use of project&#13;
funds (based on data provided by the PIUPCU) and monitoring indicators. Specific surveys can be&#13;
conducted to obtain data for this purpose. Annual expenditure reviews would be conducted to assess&#13;
government commitment to strengthen the public health functions as measured by budgetary allocations&#13;
and their distribution by activity.&#13;
&#13;
46.      BZ(ii): Impact evaluation. The aim of evaluation is to find out whether the interventions are&#13;
effective or the program is having the desired impact. The evaluation will include both quantitative and&#13;
qualitative aspects and be conducted on a yearly basis. The quantitative aspects will rely on new&#13;
information systems and surveys implemented as part of the various components of the project, currently&#13;
existing data sources, and primary evaluative data collection efforts. The goal of the qualitative aspect of&#13;
the evaluation will be to document perceptions of program managers, staff, patients, and local and&#13;
national leaders. Qualitative information will be collected using site-visit interviews, focus groups, and&#13;
respondentsurveys.&#13;

PoultryCullingCompensationScheme&#13;
&#13;
1.      Early detection and reporting, as well as rapid response, depend critically on the incentives for&#13;
poultry owners to report very quickly any sick or dead poultry to veterinarians. Without adequate&#13;
compensation arrangements in place, poultry owners have no incentiveto do this, and will fear that with&#13;
the destruction oftheir animals they will lose this valuable capital.&#13;
&#13;
2.      The June 2002 Veterinary Law in BiH confirms the right of farmers to compensation for the&#13;
elimination of contagious animals, and determines the procedures for culling and compensation. The&#13;
value of culled animals is determined by Entity Veterinary Services, accordingto the damage appraisal&#13;
list prepared by the Appraisal Commission. In the case of Avian Influenza, the Commission also&#13;
confirms the number of culled poultry. These procedures have been successfully employed for the&#13;
February2006 outbreak of HPAI in Jajce andJezero.&#13;
&#13;
3.      In the event of further HPAI outbreaks in BiH, the Project will provide support for culling and&#13;
elimination of infected and at-risk poultry, with compensation to farmers and commercial poultry&#13;
producers based on the existing legal framework and the AI contingency plan. The order for culling and&#13;
compensation will determine in advance the compensation value by type of poultry (rather than requiring&#13;
a commission to determine the value on a case-by-case basis). Accurate lists will be kept of all poultry&#13;
culled, so that the culling committee can calculate the compensation that will go to each poultry owner.&#13;
Strict requirements will apply to recording, reporting and verification of poultry culling, compensation&#13;
claims and payments.&#13;
&#13;
4.      The Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme will be financed by an IDA credit of US$0.55&#13;
million, conditionalon IDA'Sapprovalof the modalities for operating the Fund.-In addition, each Entity&#13;
would contribute US $0.10 million, as part of the regular emergency fund allocation provided to the&#13;
animal health sector.&#13;
&#13;
Village and BackyardPoultryCulling&#13;
&#13;
5.      Compensation for AI-infected poultry in Jajce and Jezero followed the procedures provided by&#13;
the contingency plan. In future cases of AI, the same approach should be taken. After official&#13;
confirmation of an outbreak, the State Veterinary Office authorizes the local veterinary stations to&#13;
undertake necessary measuresfor control of the disease. First an inventory of all poultry is done within a&#13;
radius of 3 km. Then, the actual culling is undertaken. After the culling, the owner and assessor sign a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       49&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
form defined in the Contingency Plan (Form 6 in Annex IV) in three copies. One copy is kept by the&#13;
owner, one copy is submitted to the Entity Ministry of Agriculture, and the third copy is submitted to the&#13;
Technical Support Group. Pre-numbered forms will be given to the Local Disease Crisis Coordination&#13;
Committees (LDCCCs)' based on the inventory of poultry in the at-risk region. The signed Form 6 will&#13;
be the basis for payment of farmers. The payments will be made with cash transfers through the&#13;
municipal treasury systems. After culling, owners to be compensated in each municipality and the&#13;
amounts to be paidwill be announcedina public place.&#13;
&#13;
CommercialPoultry Culling&#13;
&#13;
6.      At commercial poultry enterprises and other large producers the culling will be conducted in the&#13;
presence of the owner by a team designated by the LDCCC. All will sign a form (in 3 copies) listing the&#13;
culled birds. One copy of the form will be kept by the owner of the commercialenterprise; a secondcopy&#13;
will be kept at the entity Ministry of Agricultureand the third will be sent to the TSG. The compensation&#13;
paymentsto commercial poultry enterprises will be made through bank wire transfers. The forms will be&#13;
pre-numbered.&#13;
&#13;
Database and Forms&#13;
&#13;
7.      Forms will be printed, pre-numberedand kept with the Technical Support Group. The TSG will&#13;
keep the database ofthe forms sent to each municipality,owner and commercialproducers.&#13;
&#13;
CompensationPayments&#13;
&#13;
8.      The parametersfor payments will includethe following:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        0   Compensation to farmers will made be in cash through transfers to the respective&#13;
            municipalities;farmers will receive the compensation amounts from the municipality cashier.&#13;
            Appropriate procedures for supervising and verifying payments are specified by the&#13;
            Contingency Planfor AI and will be undertaken by the PIU/PCUat the direction of the TSG.&#13;
            Full details regardingthese procedureswill be addressedinthe ProjectOperationalManual.&#13;
            For small farmers, compensationper bird will be 100percent of the marketpriceofthe laying&#13;
            hens as reportedby the entity agriculture statistical directorate/orcompetent authority during&#13;
            the month preceding that in which the culling took place.&#13;
        0   For commercial producers, compensation will be provided by bank transfer. Compensation&#13;
            will be for reasonable replacement cost, Le., for birds less than 3 months old at the cost of&#13;
            one-day-old chicks, and for birds older than 3 months at the cost of 3-month-old birds, as&#13;
            reported by the entity agriculture statistical directorate/or competent authority during the&#13;
            month precedingthat in which the culling took place .&#13;
&#13;
9.      Ifand when an HPAI outbreak occurs, the Entity Ministry of Agriculture will issue an ordinance&#13;
for the use of funds for compensationincludingthe parametersof compensationamounts. These amounts&#13;
will be posted in a public place in the municipality. I t is strongly recommendedthat the parameters&#13;
for compensation are coordinated by both entities.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Flow of Funds&#13;
&#13;
10.     Procedureson flow o f funds should minimizedelay but ensure maximumtransparency. As stated&#13;
above, compensation payments will be made through: (i) wire transfers to municipalities which will pay&#13;
in cash for the compensationamounts to the farmers, and (ii) wire transfers to the accounts of commercial&#13;
poultryproducers.&#13;
&#13;
11.     The State Veterinary Office, through the Technical Support Group, will verify that forms are&#13;
complete, and on the basis of Form6 andthe farmers payinglists, will direct the PIUPCUto prepare the&#13;
withdrawal application with the necessary supporting documents for submission by the Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture to the State MoF to the Association for reimbursement, with instructions in the withdrawal&#13;
applicationto transfer the payment directly to the Entity MOA.&#13;
&#13;
12.     The Entity MOA then transfers the funds to the municipality treasury, which processes the&#13;
payments to the owners. On payment of the compensation, the owner signs a payment receipt form,&#13;
copies of which are forwardedby the municipality to the Entity MOA,Entity MoF and the PIU/PCU.&#13;
After the completionofthe payments, the municipalitywill submit payment lists to the TSG.&#13;
&#13;
13.     The PIU and PCU providethe TSG with reports on the payments on a quarterly basis, as part of&#13;
the regular financial management reporting. A Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme database for each&#13;
Entity will be maintained by the respective PIU/PCU to facilitate record keeping, claim verification,&#13;
payment facilitation, monitoringand auditing.&#13;
&#13;
14.     Further detail regarding flow of funds under the Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme can be&#13;
found in Appendix 6 on FinancialManagement. These procedures will be fully elaborated in the Project&#13;
Operational Manual.&#13;
&#13;
15.     Basedon the law, the payment should be completedwithin 30 days. However, it would be highly&#13;
desirable for compensation to be completed in a shorter time span, for example, no longer then seven&#13;
days. After the HPAI outbreak inJajce and Jezero, bothEntitieswere able to compensate farmers within&#13;
sevendays of culling.&#13;
&#13;
16.     Table 2 below illustratesthe funds required to compensate farmers, both commercial and non-&#13;
commercial (Le,, backyard or village, for personal consumption) if x percent of all poultry in the state&#13;
were lost to AI culling, given a price of 10 KM per free range (backyard) chicken and 5 KM for&#13;
commercial poultry and assuming a compensation scheme of 100% reimbursement for non-commercial&#13;
farmers and 50% reimbursement for commercialfarmers.&#13;

&#13;
TechnicalSupport Group&#13;
&#13;
1.       Implementationofthe Projectwill be undertakenby a Technical Support Group (TSG) consisting&#13;
of technical advisors who are representatives o f the State Veterinary Office (SVO) in the Ministry of&#13;
ForeignTrade and EconomicRelations', Ministry of Civil Affairs, FBiH and RS Ministries of Agriculture&#13;
(VeterinarianServices), FBiHand RS Ministrieso f Health,a full-time consultantfor communications and&#13;
a part-timemonitoring and evaluationconsultant (see organizationalchart below). SVO has the mandate&#13;
to coordinate veterinary services on behalf o f the Entity Ministries of Agriculture, Water Management&#13;
and Forestry. The representative of SVO on the TSG will be a permanent civil servant and will serve as&#13;
ProjectCoordinator, reportingto the Minister of MoFTER. The Project Coordinator will be supported by&#13;
one full-time administrative assistant. The Administrative Assistant could be a civil servant, but would&#13;
more likely be a short-termcontracted position. The Terms of Reference (TOR) would include assistance&#13;
with office management, record-keeping,correspondence, drafting of minutes of meetings, translations&#13;
and interpretation, and general organizational matters. The TSG will report on project implementation&#13;
progress to the Council of Ministers through MoFTER. The TSG government representatives will be&#13;
responsible for coordinatingwith and reporting to their relevant government departments, to guide and&#13;
monitor implementationof activities in their respective areas. Except for the Project Coordinator and the&#13;
communications specialist, the TSG members will serve on a part-time basis, retainingtheir regular civil&#13;
service positionsandresponsibilitiesintheir home agencies.&#13;
&#13;
2.       To facilitate the management and implementationof the Project, a Project Operational Manual&#13;
(POM) is to be prepared by the TSG as a Condition of Effectiveness. The TSG will operate as a virtual&#13;
office, with daily communications via telephone, fax and e-mail, and will meet regularly on a schedule&#13;
and in locations to be specified in the POM. The TSG will be responsible for preparationo f annual work&#13;
programs and budgets, preparationof TORSand specifications for goods and works bidding documents,&#13;
monitoringand evaluationof project activities, and preparing quarterly and annual progress reports to the&#13;
Association. The TSG shall take decisions on the basis of consensus. The detailed procedures governing&#13;
the functioningof the TSG will be described in the POM.&#13;
&#13;
Local LevelImplementation&#13;
&#13;
3.       At the cantonal and municipalities levels, implementationwould be the direct responsibility o f&#13;
each cantonal/municipalveterinary/healthauthority. Small coordination units should be established at the&#13;
local level comprising officials from healthheterinary services to work under the supervision and&#13;
guidance of the entity ministries.&#13;
&#13;
PIUand PCU&#13;
&#13;
4.       Procurement, financial management and financial reporting services for the project will be&#13;
providedby the PIU Forestry and Agriculture in Sarajevo, and by the Health Sector PCU in Banja Luka.&#13;
For procurement, the PIU and PCU will prepare bidding documents or requests for proposals based on&#13;
technical specificationsor TORSprovided by the TSG, conduct tenders, organize evaluation committees,&#13;
and processpayments to consultants and contractors after acceptance and approvalof the goods, works or&#13;
services by the TSG. TSG members or specialists identifiedby the TSG will be invited by the PIU and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
9 It is notedthat when the plannedstate-levelMinistryfor Agricultureand RuralDevelopment(exact legal name&#13;
TBD) is created, the SVO will move from MoFTERto this new ministry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    53&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
PCU to participate in proposal and bid evaluations. Further details regarding project procurement&#13;
arrangements are found in Appendix 5 below.&#13;
&#13;
5.       The PIU and PCU will be responsible for financial management under the Project. They will be&#13;
responsible for ensuring that each Entity establishes and maintains: (i)adequate accounting systems and&#13;
procedures; (ii)flow-of-funds mechanismsfacilitating timely disbursement of funds and timely payments&#13;
for goods, works and services; (iii)regular reporting on the use of funds; and (iv) appropriate&#13;
arrangements for regular financial audits. The PIU and PCU will prepare quarterly financial monitoring&#13;
reports to the TSG and the Association. These responsibilities are described further in Appendix 6&#13;
(Financial Management Arrangements) below, and will be described in detail inthe manuals of financial&#13;
procedures and summarized in the Financing Agreement. The PIU and PCU have experience with&#13;
financial management under Bank-financed projects and have established sound internal control&#13;
mechanisms on the application and use of funds.&#13;
&#13;
Operatingcosts&#13;
&#13;
6.       Most of the operating costs of the TSG, PIU and PCU will be provided by the Entities as part of&#13;
the counterpart contribution to project funding.        Operating costs may include (i)maintenance and&#13;
operation of equipment and vehicles procured or used for the management of the Project; (ii)staff&#13;
salaries; (iii)travel costs and per diems; (iv) consumable office supplies; (v) communication, printing and&#13;
publications; (vi) costs of translation and interpretation; (vii) bank charges; and other miscellaneous costs&#13;
as may be agreed.&#13;
&#13;
Poultry Culling CompensationScheme&#13;
&#13;
7.       Both the TSG and the PIU/PCU as well as government at the municipal, entity and State levels&#13;
will be involved in administration and reporting on payments under the Poultry Culling Compensation&#13;
Scheme that are financed from the Credit proceeds. Access to proceeds from the IDA credit for eligible&#13;
Compensationpayments will operate under the following procedures:&#13;
&#13;
    (a) In the event of an AI outbreak and culling of poultry, local veterinary services officials provide&#13;
         compensation application forms and instructions to owners&#13;
    (b) Copies of the forms are provided by vet services to the owner, the Entity MOAand SVO&#13;
    (c) SVO through the TSG directs the PIU/PCU to prepare the withdrawal application with necessary&#13;
         supporting documents for submittal by the Entity MOAto the State MoF to the Association for&#13;
         reimbursement, with instructions inthe withdrawal application to transfer the payment directly to&#13;
         the Entity MOA.&#13;
    (d) The Entity MOAtransfers the funds to the municipality treasury, which processesthe paymentsto&#13;
         the owners&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
1.      As described in OP 8.50 for Emergency Recovery Assistance (ERA), in addition to emergency&#13;
assistance, the Bank may support operations for preventionand mitigation in countries prone to specific&#13;
types of emergencies. Such operations could assist in: (a) developinga national strategy, (b) establishing&#13;
an adequate institutional and regulatory framework, (c) carrying out studies of vulnerability and risk&#13;
assessment, (d) reinforcingvulnerablestructures, and (e) acquiringhazard-reductiontechnology.&#13;
&#13;
2.      Given the threat that HPAI may pose to the economic and social fabric o f the country, as well as&#13;
to the health of the population because o f the risk of an influenzapandemic, the proposed Project would&#13;
be financedthrough a Credit to be approved following ERA procedures.&#13;
&#13;
A.      Procurement&#13;
&#13;
3.      Procurement under the Project will be carried out in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines:&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004, and "Guidelines: Selection and&#13;
Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004, and with the provisions&#13;
stipulated in the Legal Agreement. Agreements covering procurement methods, thresholds, and other&#13;
conditionality will be consistent with ERA assistanceguidelines and determined for the Kyrgyz Republic&#13;
according to its capacity and experience with Bank procurement.&#13;
&#13;
4.      The activities covered under the Projectwill be implementedon the basis of annual work plans to&#13;
allow for needed flexibility in adjusting activities to account for in-country experience and the lessons&#13;
from implementation by other countries participating in the multi-country GPAI. Accordingly, the&#13;
following approach to procurementwill be adopted.&#13;
&#13;
5.      ImplementingAgency Assessment. The Bank has carriedout a procurement capacity assessment&#13;
of the PIU for the World Bank-fundedForest Development and ConservationProject (FBiH), and the&#13;
PCU for the World Bank-fundedHealth Sector Enhancement Project (RS) which will be responsible for&#13;
fiduciary tasks, including procurement, and found them satisfactory. Procurement staff in the PIU are&#13;
experienced with procurement following World Bank guideless, including with all the procurement&#13;
methods to be included under the Project. The same qualified staff will be responsible for procurement&#13;
under this Project. However, given the country conditions, the Project has been classified in category&#13;
"C", signifyinghigh risk (A low, B medium, and C high risk). The annual Procurement Plan (PP) would&#13;
define thresholds for prior review appropriate to the category; these thresholds would be determined so as&#13;
to minimizeprior review as appropriate to the level o f risk.&#13;
&#13;
6.      Procurement Plan. A Procurement Plan (PP) covering the initial 12 month period of Project&#13;
implementation will be prepared by Negotiations. The updated PP for each subsequent year will be&#13;
submitted to the Bank for approval before the end of the previous year and would use a pre-defined&#13;
standard format which would list as a minimum: (i) goods and services to be procured during the&#13;
following calendar year, (ii) their value; (iii) the method of procurement; and (iv) the timetable for&#13;
carryingout the procurement. At the time o f approvingthe annual work program, the Bank would agree&#13;
on the consistency with the application of the Bank procurement guidelines to the specific procurement&#13;
lots expected duringthe year and their methods of procurement. Ifneeded, the plan could be revised and&#13;
re-submitted. A format for a typical PP would be agreedat Negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   59&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 7 .      Procurement Methods and Thresholds. The Credit Agreement would define the appropriate&#13;
 methods and thresholds for International Competitive Bidding (ICB), National Competitive Bidding&#13;
 (NCB), Limited International Bidding (LIB), or Shopping in accordance with ERA guidelines.&#13;
 Thresholds for project procurement methods and prior review requirements have been indicated on the&#13;
 basis o f the Bank's assessment o f the capacity o f the PIU which will be responsible for procurement, the&#13;
 estimated risks o f corruption in BiH, and the country's capacity o f construction and manufacturing&#13;
 industries.&#13;

                                                               agreement.&#13;
&#13;
 8.      Prior Review by the Bank. The Procurement Plan shall set forth those contracts which shall be&#13;
 subject to the Bank's prior review process. All other contract shall be subject to post review.&#13;
&#13;
 9.      Advertisement. The General Procurement Notice (GPN) shall be published in the on-line edition&#13;
 o f Development Business following Project approval by the World Bank Board o f Directors. Special&#13;
 Procurement Notices (SPN) for all ICB goods contracts and Requests for Expression o f Interest for&#13;
 consulting assignments with firms exceeding the value o f US$lOO,OOO equivalent shall be published in&#13;
the Public Procurement Bulletin, a local newspaper o f a wide circulation and the on-line edition o f the&#13;
 UNDB and posted on the websites o f the State Veterinary Office, the Ministries o f Agriculture and o fthe&#13;
 Ministriesof Health.&#13;
&#13;
 10.     These agencies will allocate a part o f their respective websites for posting information on contract&#13;
awards, including the name o f each bidder who submitted a bid, bid prices as read out at public bid&#13;
opening, name and evaluated prices o f each bid that was evaluated, name o f bidders who were rejected&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
and the reasons for rejection, the name o f the winning bidder and the price it offered. All contracts&#13;
awarded through direct contracting (irrespective o f the amount) shall be listed on the websites.&#13;
Information on the contracts awarded as a result o f an ICB and results o f selection o f consultant firms for&#13;
contracts exceeding US$lOO,OOO will also be posted on the World Bank web-site by submitting the&#13;
information to the World Bank Country Office in Sarajevo.&#13;
&#13;
11.       The PIU would follow the World Bank anti-corruption measures and would not engage services&#13;
of firms and individuals debarred by the Bank. The listing o f debarred firms and individuals is located at:&#13;
littp://www.worldbank.ora/html/o~r/~rocure/debarr.html&#13;
&#13;
12.      Procurement under Emergency Assistance Provisions. Following ERA procedures, the Project&#13;
i s likely to include financing for items included on a positive list o f imports identified as necessary under&#13;
a well-defined preparedness and response program to be prepared as part o f project implementation. In&#13;
case o f a declared global influenza pandemic, which will trigger disbursement conditions for critical&#13;
imports, support would be provided under the Project for the procurement o f a positive list o f critical&#13;
imports. These may be procured under Modified International Competitive Bidding (MICB), according&#13;
to paragraphs 2.66 and 2.67 o f the Procurement Guidelines. Also, commonly traded commodities may be&#13;
procured through organized international commodity markets or other channels o f competitive&#13;
procurement acceptable to the Bank, in accordance with the provision.&#13;
&#13;
13.       The positive list o f critical inputs to be prepared by Bosnia-Herzegovinaor to be purchased by the&#13;
Borrower from the private sector, based on historical imports duringnational emergencies, would include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      0   Pharmaceuticals and vaccines&#13;
      0   Medical and veterinary supplies and equipment&#13;
      0   Communication equipments, supplies, and public awareness campaigns&#13;
      0   Food and water containers&#13;
      0   Protective clothing and gear&#13;
&#13;
14.       Disbursements for items procured under emergency assistance provisions can be made for up to&#13;
100 percent o f import costs. No more than 20 percent o f the Credit proceeds may be used for retroactive&#13;
financing o f expenditures, and the payments must have been made after the appraisal mission.&#13;
&#13;
15.      Procurement Audits. Because the Project would have a strong decentralized implementation&#13;
element, and to help the Bank to carry out post-reviews o f procurement actions, consultants would be&#13;
contracted as a cost to the Project to carry out annual procurement audits of a sample o f contracts, under&#13;
Terms o f Reference acceptable to the Bank.&#13;

Country Issues&#13;
&#13;
1.      A Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) for BiH was carried out in 2001. An&#13;
update o f the CFAA has recently been finalized. The CFAA identified systemic and structural weaknesses&#13;
inpublic sector budgeting,accounting, reporting, and auditing. However, there have been several positive&#13;
developments in the past four years, most notably, implementation of a fully automated treasury system&#13;
across all the Cantons in the Federation and all the regions in the RS. The introduction o f the on-line&#13;
treasury system has brought about a major improvement in the accounting and reporting o f budget&#13;
execution at the State, entity, and cantonal levels. The Bank's Country Financial Management Strategy&#13;
(CFMS) envisages mainstreaming o f project management into Ministries and Departments, and abstain&#13;
from creating new stand-alone Project Implementation Units (PIUs) outside the ministries for&#13;
implementation o f Bank-financed projects. This project accordingly will use the Federation PIU in the&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture and the RS PCU established in the Ministry o f Health for the purpose of&#13;
delivering fiduciary services to the project and securing the necessary reporting.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Weaknesses and Action Plan&#13;
&#13;
4.       Financialmanagement arrangements of the AIPP are generally adequate, but a number of actions&#13;
are required to ensure that arrangements are fully satisfactory for the project, with its specific FM needs,&#13;
especially with respect to the Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme. The following action plan was&#13;
discussed with the Recipient during Negotiations. Satisfactory implementation of the action plan will&#13;
ensure the establishment of a financial management system that fully meets requirements of the Project&#13;
and o fthe Bank.&#13;

      for capacity building and not a&#13;
      F M condition.&#13;
&#13;
Implementing Entity&#13;
&#13;
5.      The main implementation responsibility of the project is with the Technical Support Group&#13;
consisting of broad technical participation from all involved institutions dealing with the activities of this&#13;
project. However, all financial management responsibilities as well as procurement responsibilities will&#13;
be given to the Federation PIU in Ministry of Agriculture and the RS PCU established in the Ministry of&#13;
Health.&#13;
&#13;
Budgeting&#13;
&#13;
6.      The two PIU/PCUs will prepare annual plans based on the implementation program, includingthe&#13;
procurement plan. RS and FBiH will allocate budget funds to cater for the Poultry Culling Compensation&#13;
Schemes according to already establishedprocedures.&#13;
&#13;
Accounting&#13;
&#13;
7.      Both the PIUs have implemented computerized accounting systems using locally developed F M&#13;
software, which is used in several Bank-financed projects and have been found to be reliable and&#13;
responsiveto Bank-needs. The PIU/PCU will be using the same software for accounting for this project.&#13;
&#13;
8.      Accounting procedures for the two PIU/PCUs are set out in their respective Financial&#13;
Management Manuals. The manual contains procedures for flow of accounting information, invoice                  ,&#13;
verification procedures, payment controls, and reporting formats. The manuals are satisfactory and the&#13;
risk associated with the accounting policies and procedures is negligible. The existing manuals will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 65&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
require only minor updates to reflect the characteristics of this project.A separate manual on the Poultry&#13;
Culling Compensation Scheme will be finalized before disbursement starts for this part of the project, see&#13;
further details below.&#13;
&#13;
9.       The staffing of the existing Federation PIU in Ministry of Agriculture and the RS PCU&#13;
established in the Ministry of Healthare considered adequate to implement this new project at the initial&#13;
phase, but additional staff might be needed to strengthen the existing capacity, to monitor the financial&#13;
managementof the Poultry Culling Compensation Schemes, and to allow for periodic visits to the village&#13;
level to review the Poultry Culling Compensation Schemes. The additional staff, if needed, would report&#13;
to the PIUPCU's financial managers and would be responsible for disbursement functions as well as&#13;
project accounting-maintaining      books of accounts, reporting day-to-day transactions and preparing&#13;
accountingreports and financial statements, as well as monitoringfinancial flows to project beneficiaries.&#13;
The financial manager will have primary responsibility for the quarterly financial reports (Interim un-&#13;
audited FinancialReports   - IFRs)and  will prepare the annual financial statements for audit.&#13;
&#13;
Internal Control &amp; Internal Auditing&#13;
&#13;
10.      With the exception of the Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme component, for which the AIPP&#13;
does not have previous experience, the PIU/PCUshave maintainedan effective internal control systemto&#13;
ensure that project expenditures are properly authorized, supportingdocuments are maintained; accounts&#13;
are reconciled periodically; project assets, includingcash, are safeguarded, and cash compensation grants&#13;
are properly accounted for.        Although project accounting will be on a cash basis, detailed&#13;
assetiinventories register will be maintainedas part of the project internal control procedures. The AIPP&#13;
will implement appropriate controls over inventories of drugs, vaccines, medical equipment, and other&#13;
sensitive and/or expensive assets will be especially importantfor the project.&#13;
&#13;
11.      Since the Federation PIU and the RS PCU are part of the government set-up, they are subject to&#13;
an audit by the respective Supreme Audit Institutionof the entities. Currently, neither entity has enacted&#13;
law on internal audit in the public sector. However, establishment of internalaudit units within ministries&#13;
i s a longterm process and has not been factored into while assessing internal control environment for the&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
12.      Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme. The Governments have established Poultry Culling&#13;
Compensation Schemes from which the owners of animals culled will be compensated (see Annex 2B).&#13;
The Veterinary Law provides the legal basis to do so, but the required implementationarrangements still&#13;
needto be refinedand put in place, andthe Projectwill providetechnical support to do so. The necessary&#13;
details will be developed and agreed upon during the first months of project implementationand will be&#13;
included inthe Operational Manual.&#13;
&#13;
13.      As a condition of disbursement of funds under the Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme&#13;
component, the PIUiPCUs will implement appropriate internal control procedures and flow-of-funds&#13;
arrangements acceptable to the Bank and documented in the Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme&#13;
manual. The Project will provideUS $0.55 million to finance and operate these Funds.&#13;
&#13;
14.      Internal ControlArrangementsfor the Poultry Culling CompensationScheme. Annex 2B sets&#13;
forth the procedures for recording poultry culled under government orders and for establishing and&#13;
recording poultry owner's claims for compensation payments. A number of minimum internal control&#13;
procedures and risk mitigation measures will be implemented with respect to recording and verifying&#13;
poultry culling and claims for compensation payment before any flow of funds is initiated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  66&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15.      The financial and operational manuals will detail the mechanisms, as described in Annex 2B, for&#13;
identifying those eligible for compensation payments, ensuring that there will be no multiple claims. A&#13;
Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme database will be maintained by the Project to facilitate record&#13;
keeping, claim verification, payment facilitation, monitoring and auditing.&#13;
&#13;
16.      In the event of government-ordered culling of poultry, the culling and the preparation and&#13;
processing of culling records and compensation claims will be done in accordance with the procedures&#13;
detailed in Annex 2B.&#13;
&#13;
17.      All forms to be used to record poultry cullings and compensation claims will provided by the&#13;
Project. They will be pre-numbered and recorded in the database of the Poultry Culling Compensation&#13;
Scheme. All unusedforms, as well as any invalid or incorrectly completed forms, must be returned to the&#13;
Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme when the culling records are submitted.&#13;
&#13;
18.      Compensation payment to poultry owners will be by cash, bank transfer or postal transmission.&#13;
There will be no vouchers or animal replacements. Payment will be made within four weeks from the&#13;
date of culling.&#13;
&#13;
19.      The owners of village and backyard poultry will, at the time of culling, receive a Culling&#13;
Certificate noting the date and the type and number of birds culled. Each certificate will be signed by all&#13;
four members of the Community Culling Supervision Committee (CCSC) or assessor and countersigned&#13;
by the poultry owner. The certificate will be completed inthree copies: one for the poultry owner, one for&#13;
the local government administration, and one will be attached to the village summary culling record&#13;
compiled by the CCSC and sent by the local government administration to the Poultry Culling&#13;
Compensation Scheme through the TSG. Certificates not signed by all members of the CCSC and the&#13;
poultry owner are invalid.&#13;
&#13;
20.      Based on the individual poultry owner certificates, the CCSC will compile a Village Summary&#13;
Poultry Culling Record. All four CCSC members will sign and the poultry owners will countersign this&#13;
list of birds culled and their owners. Forms not signed by all four members o f the CCSC are invalid, and&#13;
all claims included on an invalid Village Summary Poultry Culling Record are rendered invalid as well.&#13;
The village summary culling record is the official record that establishes the poultry owners' right to&#13;
compensation from the Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme. It will be completed in eight identical&#13;
copies: one will be posted in a weather-protected public location in the village. Attached to the copies&#13;
that are sent by the local government administration to the Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme and to&#13;
the PIU/PCUs must be copies of all individual owners' culling certificates that form the basis for the&#13;
compilation of the village summary culling record.&#13;
&#13;
21.      The local government administration compiles a Summary Report on the basis of all village&#13;
summary poultry culling records, listing all villages and for each village the total number of different&#13;
poultry culled. This report is made out in five copies and signed by the mayor o f the local government.&#13;
Attached to the copies sent to the PIU/PCUs and to the Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme are the&#13;
village summary poultry culling records and copies of all individual owners' culling certificates.&#13;
&#13;
22.      For medium- and large-scale poultry operations with more than 200 birds, the owner or manager&#13;
will, at the time o f culling, receive an Enterprise Poultry Culling Record, signed by the veterinarian and&#13;
an official from the local government administration, and certified by an audit firm acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. The ownedmanager countersigns. There will be five identical copies. This document is the&#13;
official record that establishes the poultry owners' right to compensation. Actual compensation payments&#13;
will be based, however, on the lower of (a) the number of birds reported by the enterprise to the Poultry&#13;
Culling Compensation Scheme at the end of the quarter preceding the mandatory culling and for which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    67&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the required fee has been paid to the Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme or (b) the number of birds&#13;
reported and certified on the Enterprise Poultry Culling Record. Ifall or part of the fee due to the Poultry&#13;
Culling Compensation Scheme is overdue by more than three months, no compensation will be paid.&#13;
&#13;
23.      Flow-of Funds Arrangements for the Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme. Flow-of-funds&#13;
arrangements for making compensation payments are designedto minimize the number of stages through&#13;
which funds will need to pass before reaching the intended beneficiaries, while ensuring maximum&#13;
transparency. Once authorized by the PIU/PCUs, compensation payments will be effected by the Poultry&#13;
Culling Compensation Scheme through the banking system or through the Postal Service.&#13;
&#13;
24.      Payment to the poultry owners will be made by the local government administration and&#13;
supervised by the two community representatives on the CCSC, based on the village summary culling&#13;
record kept by the local government and cross-checked against that kept in the village. To receive&#13;
payment, each poultry owner will be required to present hidherculling certificate; the date and amount of&#13;
paymentwill be recorded on the certificate and countersignedby the poultry owner.&#13;
&#13;
25.      All payments made to individual poultry owners are recorded on both copies of the village&#13;
summary poultry culling record kept by the local government administration, and each poultry owner&#13;
must sign for the payment received on both copies to confirm receipt of payment. These two copies of&#13;
the village summary poultry culling record thus become the "village culling-and-payment record". They&#13;
must be signed by the local government representative and the two community representatives on the&#13;
CCSC. The local government administration then completes the Summary Report by entering in the final&#13;
column for each village the amounts paid, by village and by type of poultry. The local government&#13;
administration keeps one copy of the completed Summary Report and submits the other to the Poultry&#13;
Culling Compensation Scheme, with a copy of each village's culling-and-payment record attached.&#13;
&#13;
26.      For medium- and large-scale poultry enterprises the compensation payments will be made&#13;
through the banking system. The Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme will transfer the funds to the&#13;
credit of the account(s) of the eligible recipients. Banking fees associated with this service will be&#13;
financed by the Project. The Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme will inform the PIU/PCUs o f the&#13;
dates and amounts of payments made, with appropriate documentary evidence. For enterprises that have&#13;
no bank account or that failed to provide the necessary account details at the time of culling, the payments&#13;
will be made through the Postal Service. The Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme will provide the&#13;
necessary information and instructions to the Postal Service, with the name and address of the eligible&#13;
recipient, and the amount of payment. The Postal Service will obtain confirmation from the recipient that&#13;
the payment has been received and will submit this confirmation to the Poultry Culling Compensation&#13;
Scheme. The Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme in turn will inform the PIU/PCUs of the dates and&#13;
amounts of payments made, with appropriate documentary evidence.&#13;
&#13;
27.      Funds Flow and Disbursement Arrangements. The Recipient will establish two Designated&#13;
Account (previously called Special Accounts), one for each Entity, in commercial banks, acceptable to&#13;
IDA. Disbursements from the IDA Credit will follow the transaction-based method, Le., traditional Bank&#13;
procedures: Advance documented with Statement of Expenditures and other records, Direct Payments,&#13;
and Special Commitments. For certain payments, above the Minimum Application Size as specified in&#13;
the Disbursement Letter, the AIPP would submit withdrawal applications to the Bank for payments to&#13;
suppliers and consultants directly from the Credit proceeds. Disbursement to the Poultry Culling&#13;
Compensation Schemes will be made on reimbursement basis. Withdrawal applications and&#13;
documentation will be checked by the PIU/PCUs before submission to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
28.      In case of declared emergency, following procedures agreed with IDA, additional funds&#13;
may be depositedto the Designated Accounts A and B, the ceiling to which may be increasedup&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 68&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
to EUR 500,000. The declarationof a nationalemergency would be a disbursement conditionfor this&#13;
element of the project. Upon declaration of an emergency, the Recipient would submit to the Bank an&#13;
initial recovery plan documenting the disaster declaration, the related budget appropriation and the&#13;
proposeduse of the funds. The PIUs will keep the Bank informed o f updates in the recovery plan as the&#13;
emergencyresponse operations unfold.&#13;

(a) Project Sources and Uses of Funds, (b) Uses of Funds by Project Activity, (c) Special Account/Local&#13;
Bank Account Statements, (d) Physical progress report, and (e) Procurement report. These financial&#13;
reportswill be submitted to IDA within 45 days of the end of each quarter. The first quarterly IFR will be&#13;
submitted after the end of the first full quarter following the initial disbursement. Formats of the annual&#13;
financial statements and the IFRs are incorporatedin the FinancialManagement Manual. The accounting&#13;
software currently used by the PIU/PCUs will need to be upgradedto have the capacity to prepare IFRs&#13;
incorporatingall components, sub-componentsand expenditure categories, as may be appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
30.      Financial Audits. There will be annual audits o f the project financial statements, covering all&#13;
aspects of the project, including specific requirements for the Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme.&#13;
The audits will be performed by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and in accordance with&#13;
International Standards on Auditing (ISA), and the Bank's guidelines on auditing as stated in the&#13;
guidelines: Annual Financial Reporting and Auditing for World Bank-financed Activities (June 2003).&#13;
The auditors' TOR will be prepared by the PIU/PCUs and cleared by the Bank beforethe engagement of&#13;
the auditor. They will include both the audit of financial transactions, an assessment of the internal&#13;
control, funds flow mechanisms, and the reasonableness of the accounting, reportingand internalcontrols&#13;
in respect o f the Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme, The annual audit reports will consist of a single&#13;
opinion on the financial statements o f the project, incorporating the project accounts, including&#13;
DesignatedAccount Reconciliation,and SR Withdrawal Schedule; as well as a Management Letter. The&#13;
audit reports will be submitted to the Bank not later than six months after the end of the fiscal year to&#13;
which they relate. The cost of the audits will be eligible for financing from the Credit. The AIPP will&#13;
provide the auditor with full access to project-relateddocuments and records, includingthe compensation&#13;
claims database, and with the informationrequiredfor the purpose of the audit. Sample TORSfor project&#13;
audit will be includedinthe FinancialManual.&#13;
&#13;
3 1.     The PIU/PCUwill carry out, or will arrange to have carried out, as part of the annual audit when&#13;
compensation claims have been paid out, additionalchecks to ensure that the eligible poultry owners, and&#13;
only they, are paid and are paid in full. This will include, but not be limited to, operational reviews to&#13;
confirm the validity and legitimacy of the compensation payments made. The reviewers would be&#13;
required to verify compensation claims and payments made in randomly selected samples of villages.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   69&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
This verification will include: checking against the database maintained by the Poultry Culling&#13;
Compensation Scheme, collecting and verifying information available and obtained at the village level,&#13;
checking with individual poultry owners, checking forms and reports, etc. Any significant weaknesses&#13;
identified will be promptly rectified in close consultation with the Bank. In addition, the external&#13;
independent auditors would be asked to provide an opinion on the reasonableness o f the accounting,&#13;
reporting and internal controls in respect o f the operations o f the Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme,&#13;
and the audit TORS(acceptable to IDA) would include these specific requirements. All ineligible claims&#13;
would be refunded to the Poultry Culling Compensation Scheme and to IDA.&#13;
&#13;
32.      SupervisionPlan. Duringproject implementation, the Bank will supervise the project's financial&#13;
management arrangements in two main ways: (i)review the project's quarterly interim un-audited&#13;
financial reports as well as the project's annual audited financial statements and auditor's management&#13;
letter; and (ii)during the Bank's supervision missions, review the project's financial management and&#13;
disbursement arrangements (including a review o f a sample o f Statement o f Expenditures and movements&#13;
on the Designated Account) to ensure compliance with the Bank's minimumrequirements. As required, a&#13;
Bank-accredited Financial Management Specialist will assist in the supervision process.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
1.       The Bosnia and Herzegovina Avian Influenza Preparedness Project has been assigned World&#13;
Bank environmental category B, since it involves moderate environmental impacts that can be mitigated&#13;
during implementation of the project. Although project activities supporting A I prevention, preparedness&#13;
and planning, response and containment are not expected to generate significant adverse environmental&#13;
effects, they do present a moderate environmental risk from inadvertent spread of the A I virus and waste&#13;
management. Overall the A I prevention and response-focused activities are expected to have a positive&#13;
environmental impact, as the investments in facilities, equipment, and training for veterinary and public&#13;
health service staff and laboratories will improve the effectiveness and safety over existing avian&#13;
influenza handling and testing procedures by meeting international standards established by OIE and&#13;
WHO. This would be reinforced by the mainstreaming of environmental safeguards into protocols and&#13;
procedures for the culling and disposal of animals during AI outbreaks.&#13;
&#13;
2.       This environmental management plan (EMP) will address the moderate adverse environmental&#13;
effects of the Animal and Human HealthComponents. For the Animal component, the EMP will address&#13;
zoonotic disease containment and waste management as pertain to disposal of special waste, emissions&#13;
and materials at laboratories, and training for veterinary services workers, to include procedures for safe&#13;
handling of A I materials, safe culling of infected and at-risk poultry and disposal of carcasses. For the&#13;
Human Health component, the EMP will focus on equipment, refurbishing and training for laboratories&#13;
and medical facilities to include key environmental issues in zoonotic disease containment and waste&#13;
management. The EMP will provide mitigation plans and monitoring plans to ensure appropriate&#13;
attention to environmental issues, and tracking progress or problems in their management. A delay in the&#13;
completion and disclosure of the Environmental Assessment from the normal appraisal stage has been&#13;
approved, instead making this a condition of disbursement for Component 2 - Animal Health, and&#13;
Component 3    - Human  Health.&#13;
&#13;
3.       The main areas of environmental risk from project activities are the inadvertent spread of the AI&#13;
virus during culling, transport and disposal of carcasses, animal waste, litter, and used protective gear;&#13;
contamination of surface and groundwater from use of disinfectants; and laboratory bio-safety and waste&#13;
management. Inaddition, minor environmental disturbances may occur during renovation of laboratories.&#13;
&#13;
4.       Strategic Communications: No environmental issues, but an important component for design&#13;
and delivery of communications tools for good hygiene, safe culling and disposal of animal carcasses,&#13;
animal waste management.&#13;
&#13;
5.       Animal Health:       Equipment, refurbishing and training for regional laboratories and border&#13;
inspection to include key environmental issues in zoonotic disease containment and waste management&#13;
as pertain to special waste, emissions and materials; training for veterinary services and poultry sector&#13;
workers to include procedures for safe handling of AI materials; safe culling of infected and at-risk&#13;
poultry and disposal of carcasses. Formal compensation for culled animals should target owners/primary&#13;
beneficiaries (e.g., specifically including women where they are the primary backyard producers).&#13;
&#13;
6.       Human Health: Equipment, upgrading, refurbishing and training for national reference and&#13;
regional diagnostic laboratories to include key environmental issues in zoonotic disease containment and&#13;
waste management&#13;

      Appendix 7: Organizationof the Veterinary Services and the Health Care System in BIH&#13;
&#13;
               BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA: Avian InfluenzaPreparednessProject&#13;
&#13;
A.       Veterinary Care&#13;
&#13;
Veterinary Services&#13;
&#13;
1.       The veterinary service o f BiH, as it currently exists (see Figure, page 64), is the combination o f a&#13;
recently created system (incorporated in the country's administrative structure as o f 1995) and remnants&#13;
o f the former (Yugoslavian) legislative and institutionalframework. Veterinary services at the state level&#13;
in BiH fall primarily under the responsibility of the senior veterinary agency in the country, the State&#13;
Veterinary Office (SVO). SVO operates under the Ministry O f Foreign Trade and Economic Relations&#13;
(MoFTER) o f the national government (Council o f Ministers(COM) o f B&amp;H).&#13;
&#13;
2.       The state o f BiH consists o f two administrative units called entities, the Republika Srpska (RS)&#13;
and the Federation o f BiH (FBiH). Each entity has its own Minister o f agriculture, forestry and water&#13;
management (MAFW), under which the entity veterinary service operates. Both veterinary services are&#13;
directly subordinated to the SVO BiH.&#13;
&#13;
3.       FBiH is composed of ten cantons, each with its own government, Ministry o f agriculture and&#13;
veterinary service.   Cantonal veterinary services are subordinated to the MAFW o f the FBiH. The&#13;
smallest administrative units are municipalities. At that operative level, veterinary service is established&#13;
through municipality veterinary practices.&#13;
&#13;
4.       The ongoing evolution and development o f the BiH veterinary service is primarily motivated by&#13;
increased awareness o f the significance o f animal health and production issues for public heath and food&#13;
safety. It is also driven by concern for economic development and food security. Further,the country's&#13;
overall developmental direction is toward full accession to the EU, which will require updating o f&#13;
veterinary services and harmonization o f related legislation with current EUrequirements.&#13;
&#13;
5.       Current issues related to the global spread o f HPAI have emphasized the need for strengthening&#13;
capacities and coordination within the veterinary service. Since institutional arrangements within this&#13;
sector are complicated and heterogeneous, placement o f the managing authority for veterinary services&#13;
(State Veterinary Office) at the national level (within MoFTER) clearly provides benefits towards a&#13;
coordinated national response to AI threats.&#13;
&#13;
6.       At this point, the H5N1 strain has only been confirmed in two wild birds in BiH. The resources&#13;
that were required to address this discovery were, on an economic and human resources scale, relatively&#13;
small, and the country's veterinary services were able to provide a response that was adequate to prevent&#13;
further spread. However, veterinary services in BiH are inadequately equipped and experienced to cope&#13;
with a large scale HPAI outbreak. This is evident across the entire range o f critical capacities, including:&#13;
surveillance and diagnosis, implementation o f response and control measures and applied research&#13;
capability necessary to understand the etiology o f the disease.&#13;
&#13;
7.       Further strengthening and capacity building will require assistance to the BiH SVO, as the&#13;
national competent authority, in developing animal health legislation related to avian influenza (further&#13;
addressed in separate section). This includes expanding human resources, developing competency, and&#13;
providing necessary equipment to support SVO staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    73&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8.      To ensure efficient implementation o f plans and programs developed and adopted at a national&#13;
level, regional (entity) and local (cantons/ municipalities) veterinary services must be strengthened as&#13;
well. This will require assistance in organizing training (possibly through SVO B&amp;H) o f regional and&#13;
local staff and assistance inequipping them with PPE and other required equipment.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
B.       Health Care System&#13;
&#13;
9.       Organization, financing and provision o f health care in BiH are the responsibilities o f the two&#13;
Entities, and the ten autonomous Cantons in FBIH. Therefore, the health care system in BiHconsists of&#13;
13 heath sub-systems to cover approximately 3.9 million people. At the BiH level, the Ministry o f Civil&#13;
Affairs (MCA) is the only State body with responsibilities for coordinating the health sector. The legal&#13;
basis for M C A is provided by the BiH Law on Ministries (March 2003) authorizing M C A to represent&#13;
BiH at international level, to establish the basic principles for co-ordination and to co-ordinate plans of&#13;
entities and other governmental bodies.&#13;
&#13;
Federationof Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH)&#13;
&#13;
10.      FBiH occupies approximately 51% o f the total territory o f BiH and has a population of&#13;
approximately 2.3 million.     Administratively, it is divided into 10 cantons, each having its own&#13;
Government and Assembly. The cantons are sub-divided into 79 municipalities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  74&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11.       The health care system in FBiH is decentralized with most competencies (functions and&#13;
responsibilities) allocated to the cantons. However, the Federation Ministry o f Health (FMOH) and the&#13;
Health Insurance and Reinsurance Fund (HIF) have the function to define the health care network with a&#13;
view to optimize its capacity for the provision o f medical services. While FMOH has the functions o f&#13;
formulating health policy and drafting laws, these functions are doubled by the cantons. Determination o f&#13;
health service needs and functions related to provision o f health care services (such as founding o f&#13;
institutions) are assigned to the cantons but, in principle, the co-ordination function lies within the&#13;
Government o f FBiH.&#13;
&#13;
Organizationof the HealthSector in FBiH&#13;
&#13;
12.       The structure o f the health sector in FBIH consists o f 11 ministries o f health (10 Cantonal and 1&#13;
Federal), 11 health insurance funds (10 Cantonal, and 1 Federal Health Insurance and Reinsurance Fund)&#13;
and 11 Public Health Institutions (10 cantonal PHI and 1 Federal). The Health care provider network&#13;
consist o f 280 public and 333 private institutions (including pharmacies) employing altogether about&#13;
23,800 persons, out o f which 3.270 are medical doctors, 5 10 dentists, 260 pharmacists, 11,180 nurses,&#13;
286 health consultants and 7,606 non medical staff.&#13;
&#13;
Distributionof functions&#13;
&#13;
13.       The FMoH is responsible for functions that cannot be executed at the Cantonal level:&#13;
&#13;
     Borders' sanitary inspections;&#13;
     Developing legislation at federal level;&#13;
     Developing health policy for the FBIH&#13;
     Planningo f the health care facilities network;&#13;
     Capacity building;&#13;
     Health inspections;&#13;
     Developing and regulatingo f compulsory health insurance; and&#13;
     Monitoring and evaluating the health status o f the population.&#13;
&#13;
14.       The Cantonal Insurance Funds are responsible for financing the health service at the cantonal&#13;
level. The Federal Health Insurance and Reinsurance Fund was established in January 2002 to address&#13;
some o f the problems associated with a highly decentralized system related to an unequal economic basis&#13;
and lack o f cross-canton health insurance coverage. The Federal Health Insurance and Reinsurance Fund&#13;
i s entitled to receive 8% o f all contributions collected by the cantonal HIFs.&#13;
&#13;
15.       As noted earlier, the basic financial functions o f the health care system in FBIH is placed within&#13;
the cantons. Each of the cantons has its own Health Insurance Fundresponsible for the overall financing&#13;
o f the health care services. The bulk o f the income for the Cantonal HIF comes from health contributions.&#13;
Health insurance contributions are based on gross salary and amount to 17%. Cantons are authorized to&#13;
define their own contribution rates within the upper ceiling o f 17%.&#13;
&#13;
16.       The FPHI is the leading research and educational institution in the field o f public health. Its&#13;
functions also include health promotion and monitoring o f the health status o f the population. In the area&#13;
o f monitoring and research, especially in the field o f health statistics and epidemiology research (also&#13;
with respect to data collection o f the 25 indicators needed for WHO reporting), there is collaboration&#13;
between the federal PHI and the Cantonal PHIS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      75&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17.      Health ministries at the Cantonal level are in charge o f Cantonal health legislation, advising on&#13;
technical matters, implementing regulations, organizing health care services and health policy planning&#13;
mostly related to the Cantonal hospitals, the health centers ( Dom Zdravlja -DZ),         ambulantas (health&#13;
posts), pharmacies and other Cantonal health institutions.&#13;
&#13;
18.      Import, procurement, distribution and control o f pharmaceutical products are under control o f the&#13;
Department for Drugs within the FMOH. This department is also responsible for drug registration,&#13;
control o f drugs and herbal products, the issuingof work permits for pharmacies, controlling and issuing&#13;
import permits for drugs and herbal products in FBiH.&#13;
&#13;
Republika Srpska&#13;
&#13;
19.      The Republika Srpska (RS) with approximately 1.4 million inhabitants occupies approximately&#13;
49% o f the total BiH territory. RS consists o f four regions: Banja Luka (630,000 citizens), Doboj-&#13;
Bijeljina (420,000 citizens), Sarajevo-Zvornik (230,000 citizens) and Trebinje/Foca/Srbinje (120,000&#13;
citizens) and 54 municipalities.&#13;
&#13;
20.      The health care system in RS in centralized with the overall power concentrated within the&#13;
Ministry o f Health and Social Welfare (MOH), the Public Health Institute (PHI), and the Health&#13;
Insurance Fund (HIF). In addition, the Drug Agency o f RS, and the Agency for Accreditation and&#13;
Quality Improvement were established inthe past 2-3 years.&#13;
&#13;
Organization of the Health Sector in RS&#13;
&#13;
21.      Health care services are provided by a network consisting o f 63 Dom Zdravlja (DZ), (including&#13;
spas and emergency centers), 16 secondary level health institutions (including psychiatry hospitals and&#13;
rehabilitation centers) and 2 tertiary level clinical centers. Altogether, 11,2 10 people are employed in the&#13;
health care sector out o f which 7,177 are medical staff (1,783 medical doctors) and 4,034 are non-medical&#13;
staff.&#13;
&#13;
Distribution of Functions&#13;
&#13;
22.     The M O H is responsible for the health sector in RS and has the following functions: Policy&#13;
making, strategy development, health care facilities, network planning, sanitary inspections, health&#13;
inspections and co-coordinating health issues in RS.&#13;
&#13;
23.     The PHI is responsible for functions such as research and education in the field o f public health,&#13;
health promotion and monitoring o f the health status o f the population. The PHI also collects data for the&#13;
25 indicators needed for WHO reporting.&#13;
&#13;
24.     The Health Insurance Fund (HIF) has as main functions the collection o f health insurance&#13;
contribution (however this does not include contribution payment) and financing and contracting health&#13;
care services. The organizational structure consists o f eight regional offices and the head office o f the&#13;
HIF in Banja Luka with four departments: Economy, Legal, Medical and Information Technology (IT)&#13;
department. Health insurance contribution amounts to 15% o f the net salary.&#13;

            Preparedness Project

        <abstracts>
            The Avian Influenza and human pandemic
            preparedness and response project for Bosnia and Herzegovina
            aims to minimize the threat posed to humans and the poultry
            industry by the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI)
            infection and other zoonoses, by enhancing both animal and
            human health infectious disease response and control
            capacities. To achieve this, three areas will be supported
            by the project: prevention, preparedness and planning; and
            response and containment. Achieving these goals will
            contribute to diminishing the burden o f disease and loss of
            productivity, limiting the regional spread of HPAI, and
            enhancing economic and social prospects at the national,
            regional, and global levels.
