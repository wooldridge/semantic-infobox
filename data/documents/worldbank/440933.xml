incentives for incumbent fixed-line operators to lower prices, introduce new services, and increase&#13;
productivity. This Note explores the impact of competition on mobile service using data on Global&#13;
System for Mobile Communications (GSM) technology. Launched in Europe in 1992, GSM&#13;
networks have grown by up to 80 percent a year and now reach an estimated 135 million&#13;
subscribers in nearly 130 countries (table 1).&#13;

            Many governments, particularly in
            developing and emerging market economies, still doubt the
            benefits of competition in wireless services. But
            international experience shows that competition in any of
            the digital technologies brings substantial benefits to
            users and creates powerful incentives for incumbent
            fixed-line operators to lower prices, introduce new
            services, and increase productivity. This Note explores the
            impact of competition on mobile service using data on Global
            System for Mobile Communications (GSM) technology. Launched
            in Europe in 1992, GSM networks have grown by up to 80
            percent a year and now reach an estimated 135 million
            subscribers in nearly 130 countries.
