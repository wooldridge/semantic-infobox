FIFTH HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT&#13;
1. THE SEVENTH HIGHWAY PLAN&#13;
A. EcCONOMIC AND SECTORAL CONTEXT&#13;
1.1    Thailand's explosive growth in GDP, averaging almost IO percent per annum between 1988&#13;
arid 1995, has led .o vastly increased demand for transport and has put severe strains on the existing&#13;
infrastructure and the environment, especially in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR). An&#13;
extensive transport network has been developed which offers a wide range of modal options at&#13;
varying levels of service including road, rail, inland waterways, ports and aviation. Road transport,&#13;
however, dominates thc sector accounting for 89 percent of the total freight traffic and 90 percent of&#13;
passenger traffic. Details of the road network and the road transport industry are found in Annex 1.&#13;
The State Railway of Thailand (SRT) has a network of about 3,861 route-km of meter-gauge track&#13;
radiating from Bangkok and connecting witlh the Malayan and Cambodian Railways. Rail freight,&#13;
representing 2 percent of national freight tonne-km, is highly concentrated in a few commodities&#13;
such that in 1991, cement and petroleum products accounted for three quarters of the total 7.9&#13;
million tonnes carried. Petroleum products alone accounted for 43 percent of the total. Similarly&#13;
for passengers, rail's share is only 9 percent and is geographically concentrated on routes radiating&#13;
from Bangkok. The Bank has been involved in analyzing the future role of the railway in both&#13;
urban and inter-urban transport as well as investment and institutional requirements.&#13;

Figure 1: Modal Split of Transport in Thailand&#13;
1.2    Thailand also has a well developed inland waterways system which covers about one third&#13;
of the country's area and comprises some 1,600 km of navigable waterways. Inland waterways&#13;
traffic is conservatively estimated to account for about 4 percent of the total freight traffic.&#13;
Hlowever, cargo flows in river transport are difficult to ascertain since various sources do not show&#13;
a complete picture of the traffic and data from different sources vary considerably. Air freight&#13;
transport is negligible and accounts for only 0.7 percent of the total passenger traffic.&#13;
1.3    Tiaffic growth has been most dramatic in road transport. Nationally, road traffic increased&#13;
at the rate of almost 15 percent per annum since 1989 while the size of the vehicle fleet, excluding&#13;
motorcycles, more than doubled, growing at an average rate of 9.6 percent per annum between&#13;
i985 and 1993. Motorcycles multiplied even faster at an average rate of 14 percent per annum,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
making up 65 percent of the nation's vehicle fleet and creating a disproportionate amount of the&#13;
noise and air pollution. With GDP growth projected at an annual rate of 5 percent in the medium&#13;
tern, and the fleet of nearly 10.8 million vehicles expected to continue growing at these rates, there&#13;
is an urgent need io increase road capacity and improve the efficiency of the use of road&#13;
infrastructure to avoid serious bottlenecks to Thailand's continued economic growth. Already,&#13;
Thailaiid has about 4,500 km of inter-urban two-lane roads carrying over 8,000 vehicles per day --&#13;
traffic levels which generally indicate foui-laning to maintain minimum acceptable speeds. The&#13;
challenge will be to service this demand while mitigating the environmental impacts of such&#13;
dynamic growthi in the road sub-sector.&#13;
1.4   In the last 30 years, government investment in the first six national development plans&#13;
(1965-1991) has expanded the paved road network from an initial 5,500 km in 1965 to a nation-&#13;
wide road network of over 57,126 km in length by the end of 1994, linking an additional 146,600&#13;
km of rural roads and 14,800 km of municipal roads not directly administered by the national&#13;
government. As the network has grown and matured, the emphasis on maintenance and&#13;
rchabilitation has increased, with maintenance expenditures per kilometer on Department of&#13;
Highway (DOH) roads more than doubling between 1988 and 1994, from 56,400 Baht/km to the&#13;
highly appropriate level of 124,700 Baht/km.&#13;
1.5    At the start of the Sixth Highway Plan, most of the planned investments were slated for&#13;
rehabilitation and reconstruction (39 percent) and paving (35 percent). Works for capacity increases&#13;
only accounted for 20 percent of the Plan. However, when the growth in demand for road transport&#13;
increased commensurate with the overall economic boom, congestion became chronic, and a mid-&#13;
term review of the Plan in 1989 shifted the emphasis away from rehabilitation and upgrading,&#13;
focusing instead on the more urgent need to expand capacity to keep up with demand. In the revised&#13;
and vastly expanded Sixth Highway Plan, widening and new links made up 68 percent of the&#13;
expanded investment program. The cost of the revised Sixth Highway Plan escalated from Baht 23&#13;
billion to Baht 119 billion due to the addition of the new widening projects, price escalation, and&#13;
revised cost estimates based on detailed engineering. By the end of the Sixth Highway Plan period&#13;
in 1991, Baht 28 billion had been expended to complete 20 percent of the program, with the&#13;
remaining 80 percent (estimated to cost Baht 97 billion) carried over into the Seventh Highway&#13;
Plan period (1992-96). These Sixth Highway Plan "Carry-over" projects, currently all committed or&#13;
under implementation, precluded any significant expenditure on Seventh Highway Plan projects&#13;
until 1994, two years into the Seventh Highway Plan period.&#13;
B. DOH's SEVENTH HIGHWAY PLAN&#13;
General&#13;
1.6    The three major goals outlined in the Seventh Highway Plan are to: (a) sustain economic&#13;
growth; (b) distribute income and prosperity to the regions, and; (c) develop human resources,&#13;
quality of life, the environment, and natural resources. The government has recognized the pressing&#13;
need for additional road capacity and is committed to mobilizing sufficient funds, accelerating&#13;
investment, and encouraging a greater participation by the private sector to provide the road&#13;
infrastructure required to achieve the stated goals. The government has also committed significant&#13;
resources, both from its own budget and from Bank and ADB loans to finance the continued&#13;

Figure 2: Revised Seventh Plan Expenditures&#13;
1.7    The original Draft Seventh Highway Plan (1992) proposed a Baht 95 billion investment&#13;
program, focused on the addition of road capacity at an estimated cost of Baht 32 billion. This&#13;
program has since been superseded by a revised Seventh Highway Plan (March 1994) which&#13;
envisions a strategic program of capacity increases (including widening, new links, interchanges&#13;
and construction of sections of the new motorways) scheduled to consume about 65 percent of the&#13;
overall investment expenditure of Baht 195 billion. The remaiiing 35 percent of the Plan is&#13;
reserved for rehabilitation, reconstruction and paving projects. The Plan is very aggressively&#13;
scheduled, with more than half the expenditures likely to be carried over into the Eighth Plan&#13;
period.&#13;
1.8    Under DOH's Seventh Plan, road expenditures, summarized in Figure 3 (See Annex 1,&#13;
Table 9), road capacity would be increased through widening 2.094 km of main arteries connecting&#13;
Bangkok with the regions to a four-lane standard at an estimated cost of Baht 46 billion. The&#13;
revised Plan also includes a widening of an additional 1,155 km of roads not located on the main&#13;
arterial routes at a cost of Baht 36 billion, and improvement of interchanges (in 38 locations) of&#13;
existing roads and the construction of controlled-access motorways (198 km). This is appropriate&#13;
since the surface condition and strength of the trunk network have been brought to a very&#13;
satisfactory level in the last several years, while congestion on the main roads in the Central Region&#13;
(i.e., the Bangkok area) clearly indicates that network capacity is not keeping pace with traffic&#13;
requirements.&#13;

Figure 3, Summary of DOH Seventh Highway Plan Period Investment Expenditures&#13;
1.9    The large Investment Plan proposed is regarded by DOH as necessary to catch up with the&#13;
unexpectedly xapid traffic increases that have occurred since 1986 (at an annual rate of some 14&#13;
percent) and to handle similar growth expected over the next several years. However, the size of the&#13;
Plan may need to be reduced due to insufficient budgetary resources and a lack of implementation&#13;
capacity. Other potential constraints would be cost pressures due to a booming construction market&#13;
and a substantial increase in land acquisition costs for the major projects planned in the Bangkok&#13;
metropolitan area.&#13;
Recurrent Expenditures&#13;
1.10   Recurrent expenses included under the Seventh Highway Plan are considered appropriate.&#13;
This is particularly true of road   r&#13;
maintenance which is allocated        140.00&#13;
higher amounts than under the&#13;
Sixth Plan, starting with a 30        120.00&#13;
percent increase between  1991             l 0.l *&#13;
and 1992. In 1994, 7.1 billion        100.&#13;
Baht were expensed for road          ~0&#13;
maintenance, averaging 124,700         8&#13;
Baht per km (See Figure 4 based    b 60.00&#13;
on Annex  , TablesI&amp;6).&#13;
Together with  the  significant        4000&#13;
rehabilitation   and   upgrading&#13;
efforts  proposed   under  the         2.0 &#13;
Investment Plan, these increases         0    :.&#13;
are considered sufficient to meet&#13;
the   additional   maintenance                     o&#13;
requirements  from    network&#13;
increases (nearly 3 percent per    Figure 4: Maintenance Per Kilometer On DOH Roads&#13;
year, but mostly at the low-  I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
volume end) and the rapid traffic increases projected for the Plan period based on recent&#13;
experience.&#13;
Financing of the Highway Plan&#13;
1.11   Government budgetary  allocations  are&#13;
expected to cover about 75 percent of DOH's                    IRD&#13;
planned expenditures. The remairing funds required       ADB   8%&#13;
would be obtained from foreign sources, including        80/-&#13;
the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank&#13;
(AD3) and the Overseas Economic Cooperation          OF\&#13;
Fund (OECF) of Japan, and would be applied            9%  \    ^&#13;
mainly to the Plan's investment expenditures. Figure      _._&#13;
5 summarizes expected financing sources for the&#13;
Seventh Highway Plan.&#13;
RTG&#13;
1.12   If the financing resources available for the                          75%&#13;
Seventh Highway Plan are not sufficient to cover  Figure 5: Seventh Highway Plan Financing&#13;
total Plan requirements (as proposed by DOH and&#13;
presented above), the Plan would be reduced by scaling down or postponing sub-projects for&#13;
mipgrading and constructing new (low volume) road links. During negotiations, agreement was&#13;
reached with the Government that it will by March 31, 1996 and by March 31 of each subsequent&#13;
year until completion of the project, carry out, jointly with the Bank, a progress review of the scope&#13;
and implementation of the Seventh and Subsequent Highway Plans.&#13;

1.13   To date, the Bank has provided a total of about US$777 million for 13 highway projects in&#13;
Thailand. Implementation of these projects has been largely satisfactory, mostly within budgets and&#13;
on schedule. The Project Completion Report prepared for the First and Second Highway Sector&#13;
Projects (dated June 30, 1994) found that the two projects helped DOH sustain a more efficient road&#13;
transport system by focusing on maintenance, strengthening institutional capacity to accommodate&#13;
traffic increases much greater than originally expected, and applying resources to enhance DOH's&#13;
fiscal capabilities. The lessons learned from the implementation of the two projects pointed to the&#13;
fact that the maintenance policy adopted by DOH and the conservatively designed pavements had&#13;
facilitated economic growth in spite of the higher than anticipated traffic volumes. The Thai&#13;
experience suggests that overall sustainability of highway sector projects depends as much on past&#13;
decisions/actions taken or not taken (on maintenance policy, building of institutional capabilities,&#13;
design standa;ds and trained human resources) as on the efficiency of eurrent projects. The PCR&#13;
also found that strong institutional capabilities combined with close Bank and Borrower relations&#13;
were essential to successful project implementation, and that the sector design approach, used for&#13;
the first time in Thailand, introduced flexibility into the sub-project management, creating positive&#13;
benefits which built on existing infrascructure and past programs and strategies. The&#13;
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Third Highway Sector Project indicated that the&#13;
project's development objectives were satisfactorily achieved, and that the design of the Fourth&#13;
Highway Sector Project incorporated the lessons learned. Implementation of DOH's portion of the&#13;
Fourth Highway Sector Project is proceeding well.&#13;
1.14   With regard to the elements of the previous projects for which DOH was not directly&#13;
responsible, i.e., the environmental, safety and industry efficiency Action Plans, anticipated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
difficulties in coordination and in procurement have been experienced. While commitment to the&#13;
Plans has been excellent and progress in policy reforms has been substantial, problems have arisen&#13;
from the need to coordinate various agencies and ministries as well as from changing institutional&#13;
responsibilities in Thailand. The establishment of the coordinating unit (APCU) and associated&#13;
advisory position in the MOTC, together with Bank supervision under the Fourth Highway Sector&#13;
Project, has provided a good basis for progress under the proposed Project.&#13;
1.15   Since- adopting the original Actions Plans in early 1991, Thailand has made substantial&#13;
implementation progress, particularly with regard to the Action Plan for Reduction of Vehicle&#13;
Emissious and Noise. Since its introduction in May 1991 in Bangkok, unleaded gasoline has&#13;
achieved more than 70 percent of the Thailand national gasoline market. By the end of 1995, all&#13;
gasolines are scheduled to be unleaded, while strict controls on benzene and other potentially&#13;
lar1uful gasoline cornponents are being maintained.  Sulfur content of diesel fuel has been&#13;
dramatically reduced, and improved lubricating oil standards are being enforced. Strengthened&#13;
en,issions standards for all classes of vehicles (especially motorcycles) have been adopted and a&#13;
schedule for phasing in the required engine modifications has been agreed. Vehicle inspection is&#13;
now required for renewal of registration for all vehicles more than ten years old in the Bangkok&#13;
area. An improved network of ambient and problem area monitoring of air quality has been&#13;
established nationwide, while special studies of particulate emissions in the Bangkok area are now&#13;
underway with the support of a Japanese Policy and Human Resources grant to Thailand. Traffic&#13;
Safety education and reporting programs continue to be strengthened, while a national road safety&#13;
niaster plan is now under preparation. DOH continues its "blackspot" elimination program to&#13;
improve the raost dangerous road sections.&#13;
1.16   The present revised and updated version of the Action Plan reflects the experiences gained&#13;
to date on the implementation of actions under the Fourth Highway Sector Project and ongoing&#13;
disc.ussions with Bank missions in the preparation of the proposed project. The Action Plan&#13;
includes a balanced mix of policies and investments to reduce the adverse impacts of motorized&#13;
transport on air quality and noise levels nationwide, and especially in the Bangkok Metropolitan&#13;
Area. These measures are summarized in Annex 2.&#13;

2. ISSUES AND ACTIONS&#13;
A. INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITiES: DOH, OEPP, LTD AND DPC&#13;
2.1    The road sub-sect.r in Thailand is highly developed and well-managed and the DOH, in&#13;
particular, is a mature and relatively efficient institution with good technical capabilities which&#13;
continues to improve and enhance its systems and human resources. Whereas maintenance and&#13;
sustaining the road network in good condition is the central issue facing most of the Bank's client&#13;
countries, Thailand faces a different set of issues which relate more to the fact that growth is&#13;
outstripping capacity. Meeting this demand while mitigating environmental impacts related to&#13;
road construction and increased vehicular use represent the key issues addressed under the Fourth&#13;
Highway Sector Project and is further supported under the proposed Project.  Successful&#13;
Tnaniageinent of the issues depends on the institutional capacities of DOH, LTD, OEPP and DPC,&#13;
particularly with regard to implementation of efforts to mitigate environmental problems such as&#13;
controlling vehicle emissions and noise pollution and reducing traffic accidents; but also in&#13;
developing a greater range of rescurce mobilization options, including private sector finance, to&#13;
fund an apprepriately-balanced, multi-modal transport network.&#13;
2.2    Depaltment of Highways. During the last decade, DOH has successfully improved the&#13;
operation and management of the road sub-sector through programs for: (a) the development and&#13;
instailati3ln of a modern and efficient maintenance management system; (b) the development and&#13;
country-wide instailation of an equipment rental system and the creation of a revolving fund for&#13;
equipment replacement; (c) improved and increased road maintenance; (d) construction of new&#13;
training facilities and implementation of an improved, expanded training program; and (e)&#13;
introduction of a road traffic safety improvement program, mostly the elimination of existing&#13;
"blackspots." Some of these programs will continue as integral parts of DOH's operations and&#13;
others as parts of the Action Plans discussed below.&#13;
2.3    A new effort being addressed under the proposed Project is the strengthening of the&#13;
Government's environmnental assessment capabilities in the transport sector, particularly for&#13;
highway development. While the widening and capacity improvements under the Seventh Plan&#13;
pose minimal environmental risk, being limited mainly to existing rights-of-way, future capacity&#13;
additions beyond the Seventh Plan will probably involve new alignments on new rights-of-way&#13;
requiring enhanced DOH environmental assessment (EA) and resettlement capabilities.  In&#13;
preparation for the proposed Project, DOH carried out a sectoral environmental assessment&#13;
(SEA). The SEA (see Annex 3) focused upon the development of a medium-term strengthening&#13;
program for DOH project EA capacities, as well as related review capabilities at the OEPP, to&#13;
respond to the mandate of the Thai National Environmental Quality Act (NEQA) of 1992 and the&#13;
Bank's Operational Directives on EA and resettlement issues.&#13;
2.4    DOH has, in fact, already begun implementation of the steps recommended by the SEA.&#13;
The first and most basic step was the establishment of the DOH Environment Unit within the&#13;
Planning Division to serve as the focal point for efforts to improve EA and related procedures and&#13;
capacities throughout the Department. While six positions were initially assigned to the Unit,&#13;
other DOH divisions have now identified staff for training in environmental issues and appropriate&#13;
aspects of the EA process. The proposed strengthening program includes mobilization of longer-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
term advisory and training professionals to enhance DOH and OEPP capacities even while the&#13;
institutional strengthening is undenvay.&#13;
2.5    Jand Tra=ortDepartme  Tb. LTD is charged with regulating commercial and, as of&#13;
1988, private vehicles. Its duties include route and operator licensing of commercial vehicles and&#13;
the setting of tariff ceilings for roaa transport, standards of road vehicles and equipment, vehicle&#13;
safety awd emis;ions inspections, and The setting and collection of vehicle licensing fees. Due to&#13;
difficulties in attracting staff with transport-related training, the Department has many vacancies,&#13;
primariiy in areas requiring tertiary education; some sections have only half of their staff&#13;
complemnent. Currently, about 700 of its total staff of 5,500 have college training. LTD's new&#13;
responsibilities for private vehicles and increased role in vehicle inspection require it to fill the&#13;
existing vacancies, to recruit additiornal personnel and to provide continuous training. While the&#13;
ongoirg and proposed highway sector projects incitade some training assistance for LTD, much&#13;
more needs to be done on both the vocaiional and tertiary levels. Specifics of the Department's&#13;
training requirememns would therefore be identified by technical assistance engaged under the&#13;
project to assist LTD in implementing selected Action Plan components.&#13;
2.6    Office of Enmironmental Policy and Planniig.  OEPP, in the Ministry of Science,&#13;
Technology and Environment (MOSTE), was created by the NEQA legislation of 1992, which&#13;
updated and streng±hened Thailand's basic enx ironmental protection law. The key role for OEPP&#13;
in the highway sector is to mitigate impacts for all development activities in Thailand, public or&#13;
private. As noted in the SEA for Highways, OEPP currently has limited capacity to fulfill its&#13;
relatively new mandate, but is actively developing the necessary procedur al framework and staff&#13;
to undertake this role. The EA strengthening component presented in Annex 3 would provide&#13;
fund- to assist OEPP as well as DOH to develop necessary capacities for oversight of the EA&#13;
processes in DOH.&#13;
2.7    Departent oif Pollution Control. The DPC, also within MOSTE, was also created by the&#13;
1992 NEQA, by transferring the staff of the former Office of the National Environmental Board&#13;
(ONEB) to staff the newly-created agency. In accordance with the provisions of the NEQA,&#13;
DPC's Air Pollution Control Division has taken a leadership role in updating RTG's Action Plans&#13;
for the Reduction of Vehicle Emissions and related discussions of institutional capacities for&#13;
implementation. DPC has rapidly expanded the staffing of the Air Pollution Control Division&#13;
during the past two years, and the agreed Action Plan (Annex 2) includes technical assistance,&#13;
training and related support to DPC as it assumes the full monitoring and enforcement powers&#13;
provided by the NEQA.&#13;
B. Vehicular Emissions and Noise Standards&#13;
2.8    Bangkok and other large cities in Thiailand, suffer from severe street-level air pollution&#13;
due to the large number of vehicles and heavy traffic conditions. The pollutants of greatest&#13;
concern are suspended particulate matter, especially respirable particulate matter, carbon&#13;
monoxide, lead, and toxic air contaminants such as benzene. Levels of respirable particulate&#13;
matter on major streets are often double or triple those considered safe, and are thought to be a&#13;
major factoi in causing and aggravating respiratory illnesses. Average blood-lead levels in the&#13;
general populace and in exposed groups such as traffic policemen are also far higher than is safe.&#13;
Traffic noise levels, due pfimardy to poorly-muffled motorcycles and diesel engines, are&#13;
extremely high.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9-&#13;
2.9    Major sources of respirable particulate matter include two-stroke motorcycles and three-&#13;
whee' taxis (called tuk-tuks), and light- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles. Most two-stroke and diesel&#13;
vehicles emit significant visible smoke, which tends to be confined in the major road corridors&#13;
and limits visibility to a few hundred yards during heavy traffic periods (which last most of the&#13;
day). lLydrocarbon emissions from two-stroke motorcycles are probably the major source of toxic&#13;
air contaminants such as benzene, while lead in the atmosphere is due almost entirely to emissions&#13;
from vehicles using leaded gasoline.&#13;
210   A key feature of the proposed Project is the RTG agreement to continued progress in&#13;
implementation of the agreed Action Plans for Highway Safety and for Vehicle Emission and Noise&#13;
Reduction, currently being pursued as components of the Fourth Highway Sector Project and&#13;
updated/extended for inclusion in the proposed Project. The impressive accomplishments in many&#13;
of the Action Plan components and the aggressive proposals for the proposed Project appear to lay&#13;
the groundwork for the RTG to play a regional leadership role in dealing with this complex set of&#13;
issues, although the increased importance of communication and coordination among the Action&#13;
Plans' implementing agencies is a cause for concern given the lack of any tradition or&#13;
adm.nistrative culture to foster such close working relationships. Generally, positive progress has&#13;
been achieved in implementing the current Action Plans, but some issues remain which have now&#13;
bc_ome priority areas for implementation under the proposed Project. Annex 2 presents the agreed&#13;
Action Plans and a more detailed discussion of the content of the major action items agreed. The&#13;
most significant components of the proposed Action Plans extension for implementation during the&#13;
1996-99 period include:&#13;
(a)    The National Energy Policy Office (NEPO) began the elimination of leaded&#13;
regular gasoline from Thailand's fuel supply effective September 1,1994, at which&#13;
time unleaded regular gasoline became available in all retail outlets. Accelerated&#13;
refinery modifications has enabled NEPO to advance the schedule for this major&#13;
milestone, and have resulted in more than 80 percent of all gasoline sold in&#13;
Thailand during the third quarter of 1995 being unleaded, with the elimination of&#13;
all leaded gasoline scheduled for December 1995.&#13;
(b)    The Land Transport Department (LTD) has initiated the process of licensing&#13;
privately-operated vehicle inspection stations in a six-province "pilot" area&#13;
centered on Bangkok. Although much remains to be done in developing the&#13;
inspection program (e.g. see points below on testing procedures and LTD quality&#13;
assurance/supervision), the LTD decision to begin actual implementation of a&#13;
vehicle inspection program for private cars, trucks and motorcycles represents an&#13;
extrem.ely significant step, while properly limited to the "pilot" area of highest&#13;
priority concern during the developmental period. The Action Plan includes the&#13;
evaluation of this pilot effort as the basis for establishment of a national l/M and&#13;
safety program.&#13;
(X)    To supplement the formal I/Mv program, an aggressive on-road emissions testing&#13;
program is also proposed to identify and force the repair of the worst-polluting&#13;
vehiicles, including those in the RTG-owned fleet.. This wil! require the active&#13;
cooperation of DPC, LTD and the Police, as well as the development of an&#13;
appropriate data network to be supported during the Action Plan period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
(d)    The Department of Pollution Control (DPC) is preparing and has begun to submit&#13;
to the National Environment Board a series of revised emissions standards for new&#13;
and in-use vehicles, as well as revised ambient air quality standards. DPC has also&#13;
announced that. under the Action Plan, white smoke/particulate standards are being&#13;
developed as quickly as possible, with special focus on motorcycle emissions.&#13;
(e)    LTD continues to make progress tovw'ard establishing the Vehicles Emissions&#13;
Laboratory to be operated jointly with DPC. The laboratory building has been&#13;
constructed and the equipment has been tendered, while the LTD/DPC operations&#13;
protocol is under discussion. Although delayed by siting/land acquisition issues,&#13;
LTD is similarly prcceeding with. the Demonstration Inspection Center to support&#13;
their quality control and training requirements for the inspection prograrn. Both of&#13;
these facilities featured prominently in the Fourth Highway Sector Project Action&#13;
Plan and remain ongoing priority items in the updated program.&#13;
2.11   Technical assistance provided under the Fourth Highway Sector Project has produced&#13;
recommendations on interim air quality standards and provisional inspection tests for in-use&#13;
ve'iicles, and resulted in suggestions which have been incorporated by LTD and the Department of&#13;
Pollution Control (DPC) as the basis of proposed Action Plan additions under the proposed Project.&#13;
Under the Fourth Highway Sector Project, a study was carried out to provide an initial analysis of&#13;
the potential feasibility of expanded natural gas/LPG use in the transport sector. The second phase&#13;
of this ongoing study will include further work on promising applications of gas/LPG technology in&#13;
Thailand. Another irr.portant technical assistance component under the ongoing project is providing&#13;
advisory support to LTD and DPC in initial implementation of the current Action Plans and&#13;
preparing the updated/extended programs included under the proposed Project.&#13;
2.12l  The Action Plans represent coordinated packages of policy and regulatory reforms,&#13;
procedural and institutional changes, and physical improvements that are designed to substantially&#13;
improve conditions in the road sub-sector. The Action Plans directed at vehicular pollution and&#13;
traffic safety are expected to have major benefits for the urban population, in particular, by&#13;
improving air quality and decreasing injuries and fatalities caused by traffic accidents.&#13;
Implementation of some measures included in or relating to the Action Plans has already been&#13;
completed or is in progress. The Action Plan Coordinating Unit within MOTC, in concert with&#13;
other involved agencies, has also selected a program of priority items in each plan which either lay&#13;
the basis for further action or address critical, long-standing issues. These priority programs (or key&#13;
items included in the programs) were selected for implementation and more detailed p.eparation,&#13;
dialog.ae and monitoring under the proposed Project. Financing arrangements for priority items&#13;
included in the Action Plans are shown in Annex 2 and include major roles for RTG as well as the&#13;
Asian Development Bank (ADB). Implementation of the Action Plan items would be monitored&#13;
during the project period (see para. 3.31). During negotiations, agreement was reached with the&#13;
Government that it would, by March 31, 1996 and by March 31 of each subsequent year until&#13;
completion of the project, carry out, jointly with the Bank, a progress review of the scope and&#13;
implementation of the Action Plans for Reduced Vehicle Emissions and Noise and Traffic Safety&#13;
and consult with the Bank with regard to the scope and nature of activities to be carried out under&#13;
the Action Plans in the course of the following fiscal year, paying due regard to the monitorable&#13;
performance indicators agreed with the Bank as well as comments and recommendations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

C. TRAFFic SAFETY&#13;
2.13   Governraent statistics indikate traffic accidents in Thailand rising by an estimated annual&#13;
average of 15 percent during 1982-92, and traffic-related deaths reported in 1992 totaled about&#13;
10,2C0, amounting to a rate of about 12.1 deaths per 10,000 vehicles. This rate is slightly higher&#13;
than those of many cf Thailand's neighbors (e.g. Malaysia and Philippines at 9), but around six&#13;
times higher than rates in the developed countries (Japan 1.8, Australia 2.3). The numbers are,&#13;
however, thought to be even higher since accident records in Thailand are neither accurate nor&#13;
complete. The factors responsible for the high accident rate include inappropriate design of some&#13;
road segments, poor vehicle condifion due to inadequate maintenance, and unsafe driver behavior&#13;
owing to inadequate driver education and the use of drugs and alcohol (especially by truck&#13;
operatcrs). Aggravating the situation is the broad mix of vehicles on the roads, the high proportion&#13;
of trucks and buses mixed with the very high number of motorcycles and the growing fleet of cars.&#13;
2.14   In recent years, the Government has taken significant actions to address these problems,&#13;
such as estabiishing the National Safety Council in the Office of the Prime Minister to coordinate&#13;
the traffic accident reduction efforts of the various agencies involved; launching a DOH "black&#13;
spot" program, which includes road improvements and the provision of traffic signals and signs,&#13;
guardrails, pedestrian bridges, etc.; and outlawing the use of amphetamines by truck drivers. In&#13;
1993, two important regulations becarme effective requiring: (i) all vehicle operators to be covered&#13;
by third-party liability iiisurance, under which drivers wish high accident records will pay higher&#13;
pre.niums or give up their licenses; and (ii) the use of helmets by motorcyclists to reduce the&#13;
severity of accidents.&#13;
2.15   Under the Fourth Highway Sector Project, the MOTC has awarded a consultant contract to&#13;
study and develop a strategy for action to address road safety issues and establish a long term Road&#13;
Safety Master Plan. The initial phase of the Plan would be funded under the ongoing project and&#13;
would include strengthening of institutions concerned with road safety, an improved accident data&#13;
system, improved vehicle testing, educational programs and a multi-media public awareness&#13;
campaign. The proposed Action Plans to address road safety and air quality related to transport (See&#13;
the matrix in Annex 2), also include the establishment of traffic safety discipline in school&#13;
curricuta, improved law enforcement and traffic surveillance, vehicle safety inspections, and&#13;
improvements ki transportation of toxic wastes.&#13;
D. RESOURCE MOBILIZATION&#13;
2.16   Although the Government does not directly link the level of road-related taxes to road&#13;
expenditures, a DOH study has shown that total road user revenues, principally from customs and&#13;
excise duties, more than cover annual expenditures for construction, maintenance and general&#13;
administration of the road network (Annex 1, Tables 7 &amp; 8). An analysis of the distribution of tax&#13;
revenues compared with the costs imposed on the network, in terms of physical damage caused by&#13;
various types of vehicles, reveals that trucks (and heavy trucks in particular) are likely to be&#13;
undercharged. Furthermore, while automobiles, motorcycles and other light vehicles may&#13;
contribute adequately with regard to pavement damage, it is less clear whether the related charges&#13;
on these vehicles represent the costs of congestion which they impose on the system. In addition,&#13;
externalities such as noise and air pollution have not been considered in the pricing equation.&#13;
2.17   The increasing need for more highway capacity, particularly for an extended inter-urban&#13;
motorway system, has raised interest in finding additional resources, preferably from road users.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12-&#13;
Fuel prices are in line with those in neighboring countries and are higher than the opportunity cost&#13;
of refined products (Annex 1, Table 10). The RTG, realizing that it could no longer fully finance&#13;
the needed highway capacity expansion solely from its own budgetary resources decided to carry&#13;
out a "Long-Term Strategic Investment Study" financed under the Fourth Highway Sector Project.&#13;
The objectives of the study were to carry out a highway investment master plan for the next twenty&#13;
years and review alternative financing mechanisms available to Government, including tapping of&#13;
capital markets and relying more on the private sector to finance a share of future highway&#13;
expansion and pricing and taxation options. One of the main objectives of the study was to develop&#13;
options which will raise revenues while ensuring more appropriate user pricing to support or&#13;
improve allocative efficiency and environmental goals. The study was completed in May 1995, and&#13;
the RTG is currently reviewing the study implications for future highway investment plans.&#13;
2.18   During negotiations, agreement was reached with Government that by June 30, 1996, the&#13;
results and findings of the Long Term Strategic Investment Study would be discussed with the&#13;
Bank, and that by June 30, 1997, a time-bound action plan would be prepared and furnished to the&#13;
Bank based on the findings of the study, and all necessary measures to promptly implement such&#13;
Action Plan would be taken with due regard to the recommendations made by the Bank.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

3. BANK PARTICIPATION&#13;
A. PROJECT FORMULATION&#13;
3.1    During the past decade, the Government of Thailand has shifted its focus from the&#13;
construction of an adequate road network to serve socioeconomic development of the country to the&#13;
protection of past investments through increased and improved highway maintenance and&#13;
rehabilitation. During this time, with the rapid growth of road traffic throughout the country and&#13;
particularly in the Bangkok area, a number of critical issues have emerged related most notably to&#13;
traffic congestion, road safety and the environmental impact of the vehicle emissions and noise&#13;
associated with high traffic flows. The Government has recognized the importance of these issues&#13;
and has already adopted some significant measures to address them, focusing in the first instance on&#13;
the air quality and enviromnental assessmeent issues which have broad potential impacts on the&#13;
population. It began. to deal with these issues in earnest under the ongoing Fourth Highway Sector&#13;
Project and expects to further advance its agenda in this area under the proposed Project. The&#13;
proposed Project, in addition to focusing specifically on improving air quality and road safety&#13;
thnrugh the establishment of a comprehensive vehicle inspection system would also focus on&#13;
assisting DOH to meet its targets in providing additionai highway capacity to meet the ever-&#13;
increasing traffic levels, particularly on the main trunk road network. The loan, together with&#13;
proceeds from the Fourth Highway Sector Project (Loan 3446-TH), would finance a slice of about&#13;
4 peircent of total expenditures under DOITs Seventh Highway Plan during the last year of the plan&#13;
period (and some of its carry over into the Eighth Plan, i.e., Government FY1996-99).&#13;
B. RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
3.2    The rapid growth of the Thai economy during the last decade raises two sets of issues that&#13;
need to be addressed in order to sustain development. First, the quality and adequacy of physical&#13;
infrastructure, particularly of transportation facilities, are emerging as key constraints to medium-&#13;
te-m growth. Infrastructure bottlenecks are already serious in the Bangkok metropolitan region, and&#13;
now extend to many secondary towns. Secondly, the environmental impacts of rapid growth,&#13;
particularly due to the increase in demand for transport and energy, are raising concerns about the&#13;
quality of future growth. As a recent Bank economic report (Report No. 11770) found, the social&#13;
costs of traffic congestion and transport-related air pollutants are already high and would continue&#13;
to rise without concerted policy actions.&#13;
3.3    Hence, the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Thailand, which was discussed by the&#13;
Board on September 22, 1994, considers these two areas among the priorities for Bank lending and&#13;
policy advice. The proposed Project is a logical extension of the efforts initiated under the Third&#13;
and Fourth Highway Sector Projects. It sets the stage for developing a longer-tern transport&#13;
strategy as the opportunities for widening existing roads are reduced and as public sector resources&#13;
fall short of financing requirernents raising the need to attract private funds. Moreover, it continues&#13;
to build on government efforts to address the environmental and safety implications of road traffic&#13;
growth. While a more direct treatmrent of these latter issues, particularly in BMR, through a&#13;
specific urban transport project or urban environmental project may be called for, the institutional&#13;
make-up of Thailand has made it difficult to develop such operations. The Highway Sector Project&#13;
series, however, has served as an effective instrument to address many of these issues with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14-&#13;
significant implications for BMR as much of the related sectoral policy responsibilities lie within&#13;
the purview of the Ministry of Transport and Communications.&#13;
C. OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.4    With the gzneral objective of meeting the continued rapid growth in transport demand&#13;
resulting from sustained economic growth, and to address critical issues associated with transport-&#13;
related enviromnental pollution and traffic safety, the project aims specifically at: (a) furthering the&#13;
implementation of actions aimed at reducing environmental degradation and vehicular accidents&#13;
atLributable to fast growing motorization through the establishment of a privately operated vehicle&#13;
inspection system; (b) improving the quality of service of the inter-urban road network thorough&#13;
increased road capacity and improved safety standards of existing roads; and (c) providing a&#13;
systematic basis for the establishmert of environmentai assessment criteria at the design stage as&#13;
well as environmental management during and after new road construction and capacity increases.&#13;
D. DESCRIPTION OF BANK-FINANCED COMPONENTS&#13;
3.5    The project would finance the tollowing components over a period of about four years:&#13;
(a)    civil works sub-projects for capacity increases involving the widening to four lanes&#13;
and rehabilitation of the existing two lanes of selected sections of the country's&#13;
major inter-urban national highways;&#13;
(b)    consulting seivices for the design and supervision of DOT-s road widening&#13;
program;&#13;
(c)   technical assistance and training to LTD, DPC, DOH and MOTC related to air&#13;
quality, highway safety improvements, and institutional development, and;&#13;

DOH and OEPP.&#13;
Capacity Increases Through Widening&#13;
3.6     ub-prWjecta. Widening works would be comprised of the construction of two new lanes&#13;
(embankment. pavement, drainage, structures, etc.) and, as required, the rehabilitation of the&#13;
existing two lanes (rnostly pavement works) and the construction of intersections with other major&#13;
roads most of which would be at-grade, all to be in accordance with class "D" of DOI's standard&#13;
for a divided highway, which is acceptable to the Bank. Works would be carried out entirely along&#13;
existing alignments and within the existing right-of-way.&#13;
3.7    Design and Supervision. DOH carries out about half of the annual design work load, while&#13;
the remainder is carried out by local consultants with some assistance from foreign consultants for&#13;
major or especi.;lly complex designs The design of some 250 km of roadworks as described above&#13;
would be financed under the project and carried out by consultants under four contracts which&#13;
would require a total of some 400 staff-months of mostly local consultants. Supervision of civil&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
works would be carried out by DOH staff supplemented by about 100 staff-months of local&#13;
consultants and 25 staff-months of foreign consultants for overall coordination.&#13;
3.8    Sub-projects for financing under the project were selected and agreed at negotiations for&#13;
the first year of project implementation and by March 31 annually thereafter based on procedures&#13;
and econom;c and technical criteria, including an economic rate of return of at least 12 percent, as&#13;
agreed by the Government and the Bank under previous sector loans (para. 3.17).&#13;
Institutional Strengthening of DOH&#13;
3.9    DOH, with assis[ance from consultants financed under Loan 3446-TH, is developing a&#13;
future strategy for road investments and new approaches to the associated necessary resource&#13;
mobilization, including restructuring of road user charges and the collection of tolls, as well as&#13;
planrning a revised organizational structure to administer and operate roads of the future. The study&#13;
was completed in May 1995 and Government is formulating an Action Plan based on the findings&#13;
of the study for discussion with the Bank. DOH has agreed to allocate resources from its own&#13;
budget to cover the costs of consultant services to assist in the implementation of follow-up actions&#13;
to the studv.&#13;
Improvements to DOH's Training Facilities&#13;
3.10   Previous projects provided funds for, inter alia, construction of two training centers, one at&#13;
headquarters and the other at Chon Buri. The building at headquarters was completed and fully&#13;
equipped in 1992 and has been in continuous use since. Completion of the center at Chon Buri was&#13;
delayed uptil 1993 and although in use, it is seriously lacking in furniture and in training equipment&#13;
and aids. Also, housing for teaching staff has been occupying a significant part of the dormitories&#13;
because housing for such staff is not available. To assist DOH in increasing their current training&#13;
caracity (about 5,000 staff on average annually in courses of 1 to 65 days duration as well as a few&#13;
hundred highway officials from Laos and Myamnar), ADB has agreed, under its Second Regional&#13;
Roads Sector Project, to provide financing to add housing for teaching staff at the Chon Buri center&#13;
and to furnish and equip the center to make it fully operational.&#13;
Environmental Capacity Strengthening of DOH and OEPP&#13;
3.11   As a follow-up to DOH's SEA for the highways program (paras. 2.3 and 2.4), the project&#13;
includes a technical assistance component of US$5.0 million for a strengthening program for DOH&#13;
for enviromnental assessment and the EA oversight capacities of OEPP. The component includes&#13;
training, preparation of guidelines and manuals, and program development. Approximately 186&#13;
staff-months of technical assistance by international and national consultants in the environmental&#13;
and technical fields would be provided under this component through seven contracts, ranging from&#13;
3 to 100 staff-months. (Draft terms-of-reference for the various technical assistance assignments are&#13;
detailed in Annex 3.)&#13;
,.12   In addition to its own resources, the Government will implement the program with support&#13;
from the World Bank and ADB. The Bank will provide US$2.0 million for financing of the&#13;
environmental specialist, development and use (including training) of guidelines for design,&#13;
strengthening DOH's capacity to deal with social issues, and strengthening OEPP's capacity to&#13;
review and monitor the EIA process for the road sector. The technical assistance will be about 80&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16-&#13;
person months under four contracts. Financing of the training program, strengthening of the DOH&#13;
Environmental Unit (EU), and other remaining activities will be provided by ADB (US$ 2.0&#13;
million) and the Govemrment.&#13;
Action Plan Implementation&#13;
3.13    The project includes funding for technical assistance and training and some minor&#13;
equipment purchases to assist MOTC, LTD, DPC and associated agencies to implement the Action&#13;
Plans dealing with the reduction of motor vehicle emissions and noise as well as traffic safety (See&#13;
Annex 2). Approximately 10 contracts for 400 staff-months of technical assistance and advisory&#13;
services by local and international professionals would be covered under this component.&#13;
Financing would be provided from Government resources (US$13.7 million), as well as support&#13;
from the ADB (US$2.0 million) and the Bank (US$2.19 million). In addition, funds would be&#13;
provided for short courses and training of staff from the principal Action Plans implementation&#13;
agencies. Consulting assignments may be redefined to focus on specific tasks as defined in the&#13;
Action Plans as they are reviewed periodically.&#13;
E. COST ESTIMATE AND FINANCING&#13;
3.14    Project Costs. Together with remaining balances of the Fourth Highway Sector Loan, the&#13;
proposed Bank loan of US$150.00 millioii would finance about 7.5 percent of the last year&#13;
expenditures of DOH's Seventh Investment Plan and carry-overs into the Eighth Plan (Government&#13;
FY 1996-99). The ADB would provide US$6.00 million under its Second Regional Roads (Sector)&#13;
Project. Table I shows the cost of the various project components.&#13;

F. IMPLEMENTATION OF BANK-FINANCED ACTIVITIES&#13;
3.16    As under the previous four highway sector projects, MOTC would be responsible for&#13;
executing most parts of the project through its Departments of Highways (DOH) and Land&#13;
Transport (LTD). DOH would be responsible for all civil works components, while LTD would&#13;
execute selected activities under the actions plans for road traffic safety and vehicle emissions&#13;
inspections. The remaining Action Plan activities would be carried out by the respective agencies&#13;
concerned and coordinated by the APCU, with DPC playing a leading role with regard to vehicle&#13;
emissions. (para. 2.7)&#13;
3.17    During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government that it will, by&#13;
December 31, of each year until completion of the Project, furnish to the Bank, for its review and&#13;
approval, a list of sub-projects to be financed under the project, and that the selection of sub-&#13;
projects to be financed under the project will use technical, environmental and economic criteria&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
agreed upon between the Borrower and the Bank, including (i) a minimum economic rate of return&#13;
of twelve percent (12 percent) and (ii) measures adopted by the Borrower to avoid or minimize the&#13;
involuntary resettlement or relocation of persons occupying the land acquired to carry out the&#13;
respective sub-projects. Any sub-project involving the involuntary resettlement of persons would&#13;
be subjected to the preparation of a Resettlement Plan, satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
3.18   Project supervision by the Bank would require about 96 staff-weeks over the life of the&#13;
project, of which about 29 staff-weeks would be at headquarters for review of progress and audit&#13;
reports, procurement actions, etc. and 67 staff-weeks would be in the field. This input is higher than&#13;
the average but is dictated by the complex nature of the Action Plans, which require considerable&#13;
input by exverts. Supervision would be provided by a highway engineer, transport economist and&#13;
specialists in fields covered by the Action Plans. The borrower's contribution to supervision would&#13;
include daily supervision of implementation, the preparation and submission to the Bank of reports&#13;
on various subjects, including implementation progress, and coordination of the Bank's field visits.&#13;
A project supervision plan is shown in Annex 4. Supervision of the project's civil works program&#13;
would be coordinated with ADB and OECF, the other major external agencies supporting&#13;
implementation of the Seventh Highway Plan (para. 3.31).&#13;
G. PROCUREMENT OF BANK-FINANCED INPUTS&#13;
3.19   Procurement of project inputs would be carried out as shown in Table 3:&#13;

under their Second Regional Roads Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19-&#13;
3.20   Civil works financed under the Bank loan would be carried out under contracts procured on&#13;
the basis of International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
1995 Guidelines and using the Bank's standard bidding documents. Pre-qualification of contractors&#13;
would be carried out annually under procedures also in accordance with Bank Guidelines and using&#13;
the Bank's standard documents. However, foreign contractors would always have the option of&#13;
being considered for any tender throughout the year. Pre-qualified contractors would be allowed to&#13;
bid on any contract or group of contracts for civil works but would be eligible for awards only up to&#13;
the value of works for which they are pre-qualified.&#13;
3.21   Consultants would be employed in ac.cordance with the Bank's Guidelines and using the&#13;
Bank's Standard Documents for the use of consultants. Outline terms of reference for this&#13;
assistance are included in the project file. The Institutional Development and Training Facilities&#13;
components, as well as the ADB-financed portions of the Action Plans Components, would be&#13;
procured in accordance with ADB's procedures.&#13;
3.22   DOH and LTD would be the main procurement agencies. Both have experience in carrying&#13;
out procurement under Bank-financed projects as this will be the fourteenth highway project&#13;
implemented by DOH and the fifth with LTD involvement. Both agencies will use the Bank's&#13;
standard documents for tendering and contracting. Minor components of the Action Plans would be&#13;
carried out by agencies with less experience in project implementation, including procurement, but&#13;
these agencies would be assisted in procurement and other implementation matters by technical&#13;
advisers in the APCU.&#13;
3.23   A draft Country Procurement Assessment Report was completed in December, 1994, and&#13;
was sent to the Government tor review. Dialogue with the Government is continuing on several&#13;
items. However, in the context of this project, the Borrower's procurement regulations and&#13;
procedures for projects financed by external loans were reviewed by Bank staff and found to be&#13;
consistent with Bank guidelines.&#13;
3.24   Under the project, Bank-financed works c3ntracts above US$15.0 million each would be&#13;
subject to prior review by the Bank; this review is expected to cover about 90 percent of estimated&#13;
total contract values. Contracts for consultancy services estimated to cost more than US$100,000&#13;
for firms and US$50,000 for individuals would be subject to prior review.&#13;
H. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
3.25   Disbursement of the proposed Bank loan would be made against applications based on&#13;
contracts for sub-projects eligible for Bank financing as follows:&#13;
(a)    Civil Works: 50 percent of total expenditures;&#13;
(b)    Consultant Services and Training: 100 percent of total expenditures.&#13;
3.26   For the civil works and environmental assessment components under the responsibility of&#13;
DOH, the project would use the Government's established internal revolving fund system which&#13;
enables the Controller General's Department to advance funds from its own resources to line&#13;
agencies for expenditures in both local and foreign currencies. When project expenditures reach&#13;
US$50,000, the Controller General's Department will batch the withdrawal applications and submit&#13;
them to the Bank for disbursement. Disbursement for consultants' contracts costing less than&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
US$100,000 each for firms and less than US$50,000 each for individual consultants and&#13;
disbursements for training would be made against Statements of Expenditures (SOEs).&#13;
3.27   For all APCU project components, withdrawal applications would be grouped as far as&#13;
possible to meet the US$50,000 minimum, but for small technical assistance contracts and training,&#13;
the minimum withdrawal application would be US$20,000 to facilitate prompt payments to the&#13;
various agencies involved.&#13;
3.28   A schedule of estimated disbursements (Table 4) has been prepared on the basis of a&#13;
tentative implementation schedule prepared by DOH and APCU. The projected disbursement&#13;
profile for the proposed Bank participation is broadly in line with recent highway implementation&#13;
performance. It is expected that loan disbursements will be completed in about four years. The&#13;
Completion Date of the project would be December 31, 1999 while the Loan Closing Date would&#13;
be June 30, 2000.&#13;

I. MONITORING AND AUDITING&#13;
3.29   DOH and LTD would be responsible for administering most contracts under the proposed&#13;
loan, but APCU would also administer contracts for technical assistance required for&#13;
implementation of the Action Plans. These agencies would keep records of all procurement&#13;
documents (including bids and proposals and their evaluation and contract awards) as well as&#13;
official decisions on each agreed contract, showing accumulated expenditures, monthly payments&#13;
and other administrative data. Based on these records, the agencies would regularly prepare reports&#13;
showing this information, as instituted under the previous highway sector projects. The Bank would&#13;

- 21 -&#13;
reserve the right to inspect and review the documentation maintained on individual contracts by the&#13;
agencies and would be sent copies of documents on request.&#13;
3.30   In order to fully monitor the progress of the Action Plans, the environmental strengthening&#13;
component and the associated technical assistance inputs, it is appropriate that a Mid-Term Review&#13;
of these proiect components be carried out. Such a review will allow the Bank and the&#13;
implementing agencies to: (i) take stock of the implementation progress taking into account initial&#13;
performance indicators and evaluation criteria; (ii) review, update and approve established Action&#13;
Plans for the following phase, including updating cost estimates; (iii) evaluate the environmental&#13;
strengthening program and prepare a revised implementation program; (iv) discuss all related&#13;
activities in the road sub-sector financed by other donor agencies, and; (v) exchange information&#13;
among Implementing Agencies and propose solutions to implementation issues. During&#13;
negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government that it would prepare a report, furnished&#13;
to the Bank no later than January 31, 1998, evaluating the progress achieved in implementation and&#13;
including a draft plan for work to be carried out during the remaining period of implementation&#13;
and, with the Barnk, conduct a Mid-Term Review, occurring no later than March 31, 1998.&#13;
3.31   The annual consultations on the highway program and budget and on the overall Action&#13;
Plans implementation would provide the major opportunity for reviewing progress of the&#13;
investment plan for the national roads and the implementation of the proposed Project. Monitoring&#13;
and supervision of the project would focus on the following: (a) the evolution and subsequent&#13;
confirmation of the annual programs and their financial and physical targets for the road investment&#13;
and maintenance programs; (b) the progress made in pursuing the institutional and sub-sectoral&#13;
objectives of the project included in the Action Plans for road traffic safety and pollution control,&#13;
and; (c) the implementation progress of Bank-financed sub-projects. A set of key indicators would&#13;
be established to measure the effectiveness of the Action Plans: for road traffic safety - annual&#13;
changes in the rate of accidents, including the number of injured and dead, and property damage&#13;
costs; for air and noise pollution control - annual changes in the level of pollutants emitted by&#13;
vehicles; and for the vehicle inspection system - annual changes in the rate of failure to pass&#13;
inspections.&#13;
3.32   During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government that: (a) the&#13;
implementing agencies would keep separate accounts for the proposed Project; (b) the project&#13;
accounts, including documentation for SOEs, would be audited annually by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, with the audit also including a separate opinion on SOEs used as a basis for&#13;
disbursement, and; (c) the detailed audit reports would be submitted to the Bank within nine months&#13;
of the end of each government fiscal year.&#13;
J. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THE PROJECT&#13;
3.33   Project support to the ongoing Action Plan to Reduce Vehicle Emissions and Noise&#13;
Pollution would have a positive effect on the environment. Thailand's rapidly increasing&#13;
motorization has been accompanied by serious health hazards posed by high levels of vehicular&#13;
emissions and noise in urban areas. The dangerous effects of respirable particulate matter, high lead&#13;
levels and high carbon monoxide levels are now of growing concern to the population at large. The&#13;
Government has recognized and begun to alleviate this situation through the introduction of lead-&#13;
free gasoline and improved smokeless lubricants as well as the mandating of tougher noise and&#13;
emissions standards for new vehicles. Action Plan components to be carried out under the project&#13;
would address these issues through the further strengthening of fuel standards, the development of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
more stringent -missions standards, vehicle inspection and roadside testing targeted to reduce&#13;
vehicular pollution in the country's urban areas, particularly Bangkok.&#13;
3.34   In preparation for the Fifth Highway Sector Project, DOH carried out a sectoral&#13;
environmental assessment (SEA) for its Seventh Highway Plan Program. The SEA focused upon&#13;
the development of a medium-term strengthening program for DOH project environmental&#13;
assessment (EA) capacities, as well as related review capabilities at the OEPP, to respond to the&#13;
mandate of the Thai National Environmental Quality Act (NEQA) of 1992 and the Bank's&#13;
Operational Directives on EA and resettlement issues. Both DOH and OEPP have agreed to the&#13;
propcsed budget and implementation arrangements for the strengthening program, and have&#13;
formally endorsed the SEA. The SEA Summary has been made available for comment locally,&#13;
within the Bank and publicly through the Bank's Public Information Center. This SEA document is&#13;
one of the first of its type produced under updated Bank procedures for Sectoral EAs, released in&#13;
October 1993.&#13;
3.35   DOH  has confirmed that the recommended process (Annex 3, Figure 5.1) for&#13;
environmental assessment (EA) would be applied for all new sub-projects under the Seventh and&#13;
subsequent Highway Plans. These procedures, which are generally consistent with the Bank's EA&#13;
requirements, call for the screening of all projects for their environmental impacts at the feasibility&#13;
study stage and incorporation of any needed mitigation measures in the project design. DOH has&#13;
provided EA screening summaries for all ongoing projects for which Bank financing is committed&#13;
or proposed under the project. These projects mainly involve rehabilitation and widening of roads&#13;
on existing alignments and within existing rights-of-way. EA screenings of additional sub-projects&#13;
to be financed by the Bank would be submitted by the newly-created DOH Environmental Unit and&#13;
found acceptable prior to Bank funding of such sub-projects. Although not anticipated under this&#13;
project, DOH has agreed that full EA reports, following guideline terms of reference previously&#13;
agreed with the Bank, would be carried out for all projects entailing new rights-of-way or expected&#13;
to have a significant environmental impact.&#13;
3.36   DOH will routinely monitor the sub-projects to assess the effectiveness of any mitigation&#13;
measures included in their designs and will include any necessary additional measures for&#13;
environmental protection in supplemental investment programs or the maintenance budgets for&#13;
such projects. Bank supervision missions will also review the results of the screening process and&#13;
the coordination between DOH and OEPP for all highway sector sub-projects, not only those&#13;
financed by the Bank, in conjunction with assessing the effectiveness of the EA strengthening&#13;
component. Although essentially no resettlement is required for sub-projects currently identified for&#13;
financing under the proposed Project, copies of Bank guidelines and requirements for resettlement&#13;
of persons displaced by project works have been provided to DOH, which has agreed that in the&#13;
event that resettlement is required, it would prepare a resettlement plan to be submitted to the Bank&#13;
for approval.&#13;
K. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION&#13;
3.37   The proposed investments under the project are limited mainly to the widening of key&#13;
sections of RTG's main trunk road network, representing about 90 percent of the project costs. All&#13;
of these works are subjected to feasibility studies based on criteria reviewed and approved by the&#13;
Bank. Cost estimates are based on preliminary engineering studies, and the benefits consist of&#13;
savings in vehicle operating costs, maintenance cost savings, and diverted or generated traffic&#13;
benefits, whenever applicable. Time savings are not included, except in cases where congestion is a&#13;
factor. Vehicle operating cost savings are based on the terrain in which a particular sub-project is&#13;
located and on the traffic composition and growth. DOH maintains a country-wide system of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
regular traffic counts and updated vehicle operating costs. The minimum economic return for sub-&#13;
projects to be included in the plan is established at 12 percent. A tentative list of sub-projects&#13;
submitted for inclusion in the Bank program have rates of return ranging from 19 to 63 percent. All&#13;
sub-projects to be included in the proposed Project will be selected in accordance with the&#13;
methodology which has been approved and reviewed periodically by the Bank.&#13;
3.38   The economic assessment of the other project components, i.e. the Action Plan items&#13;
relating to the air quality and road safety as well as the DOH Environmental assessment&#13;
component, is more complex and, by necessity, of a qualitative rather than quantitative nature.&#13;
These items are deemed to have substantial positive benefits, not only to the transport sector, but&#13;
also to the improved health and well-being of the population at large. As such, the benefits cannot&#13;
be easily quantified, although the key indicators developed to monitor the progress of Action Plan&#13;
implementation (Annex 2) will provide objective measurements of some benefits of Action Plan&#13;
components.&#13;
L. PROJECT RISKS&#13;
3.39   There is no serious risk that DOH will falter in the implementation of its investment&#13;
program as road works to be carried out under the program largely follow the alignments of&#13;
existing roads, minimizing property disturbances and land acquisition for rights-of-way. The main&#13;
project risks relate to Action Plan implementation. While implementation of some Action Plan&#13;
measures were delayed under the Fourth Highway Sector Project, the momentum has now been&#13;
established and implementation has progressed satisfactorily. However, the political sensitivities of&#13;
some of the issues will undoubtedly cause some implementation problems. To counter this&#13;
possibility, continued use of technical assistance would be made under the project to prepare and&#13;
implement the various components and a coordinating unit, established under the Fourth Highway&#13;
Sector Project, is continuing to assist MOTC in the overview of Action Plan components.&#13;

THAILAND&#13;
FIFTH HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT&#13;
The Highway Subsector&#13;
A. The Highwav Network&#13;
1.    At the end of 1994, Thailand's public road network totaled about 218,642 km and comprised&#13;
about 57,126 km of national roads (including about 340 km of high volume, limited access special&#13;
highways) and about 146,600 km of rural roads (Table 1 to this annex and Map IBRD 26039) as well&#13;
as some 14,800 km of municipal roads, of which about 2,800 km were in Bangkok (excluding some 20&#13;
km of the Second Stage expressways opened in 1993). The national road system connects the principal&#13;
towns and regional/provincial centers throughout the country and interconnects the rural roads; it is a&#13;
very extensive system and also serve as direct access to a substantial proportion of villages and rural&#13;
population. The rural (or tertiary) roads connect the remaining villages and rural population with the&#13;
national road systems. The Northeast Region has the greatest length of national roads, with a share of&#13;
about 30%, followed by the Northern Region with 29%, the Central Region with 23%, and the South&#13;
with 17% (Table 2). For rural roads, the approximate regional distribution is 44%, 22%, 21 %, and 13 %,&#13;
respectively.&#13;
2.   Before the national and provincial highway were'combined into one national road system by the&#13;
Highway Act of 1992, the former national highway system had grown from 15,200 km to 18,300 km&#13;
since 1965, while the former provincial highway system grew from 28,700 to 33,900 km. During the&#13;
same period, the proportion of paved road had also increased from 36% to about 94% for the former&#13;
national highway system, and from about 5 % to 67 % for the former provincial highway system, and the&#13;
new national road system had 78% paved and 22% unpaved roads in 1993. Despite the rapid rate of&#13;
improvement, expansion of the former national and provincial road system has been relatively small,&#13;
averaging about 2.3% annually.&#13;
3.     The new national road system covers a wide range of design standards, surface condition and&#13;
capaciiies. The former national highway network is now almost entirely improved and paved. Most&#13;
roads are adequately aligned and have sufficient capacity for present traffic; however, increasing traffic&#13;
on several sections, particularly the main routes radiating from Bangkok, is creating congestion which&#13;
requires significant capacity increases through an increased number of traffic lanes and improvement of&#13;
intersections. In the medium term, construction of new roads will be confined to a small number of&#13;
additional links to complete the network and to shorten some routes.&#13;
4.    As for the former provincial road system, there is still an existing need to upgrade several&#13;
thousand km of unpaved and unimproved roads, virtually all of which serve as rural access roads. These&#13;
roads have not been constructed to defined engineering standards and often lack permanent drainage&#13;
structures and have little, if any, gravel surfacing; many sections are impassable during rainy weather.&#13;
5.    The rural road system is also extensive, with an average density of about 1 km per 3.9 km2. The&#13;
roads are of low standard, average about 4.5 m wide, and have traffic of less than 50 vehicles per day&#13;
(vpd). Most are unimproved or gravel roads. In the dry season, about two thirds are usually in fair&#13;
condition and one third are poor. In the rainy season, many roads become impassable. When justified by&#13;
significant traffic levels, rural roads are reclassified as national roads and responsibility for their&#13;
maintenance and improvement is transferred to the Department of Highways.&#13;
&#13;

B. Road Transport&#13;
Motor Vehicle Fleet&#13;
6. The motor vehicle fleet, including motorcycles, grew from about 3.4 million units in 1984 to about&#13;
10.8 million units in 1993 (Table 4). Excluding motorcycles, the increase was from about 1.4 million&#13;
units :o over 3.7 million units, with an average annual growth of 10.8%, while motorcycles grew at&#13;
16.1 %.  Cars and pickups represented about 63%  of the total fleet of four-wheel vehicles, with&#13;
commercial vehicles--buses, trucks and other utility vehicles--making up the remainder.&#13;
7.    Car ownership in Bangkok is still low, at about 120 per thousand population in 1992, with&#13;
motorcy cle ownership at 181 per thousand. A doubling of car and motorcycle ownership is expected over&#13;
the next decade. Regional car ownership is muck lower than in Bangkok (car ownership in the country&#13;
is 16 per thousand population) but varies greatly among the cities, with higher levels in the more affluent&#13;
tourist areas like Chiang Mai and Phuket. Throughout the country, road transport is dominant, carrying&#13;
about 92% of passengers and 89% of freight.&#13;
Traffic&#13;
8.     Motorized traffic (excluding motorcycles) on all national and special highways rose from about&#13;
22 billion vehicle-km in 1983 to an estimated 64 billion vehicle-km in 1992. Cars and taxis account for&#13;
about one-third of the vehicle-km, another one-third is of light trucks. About 50% of this traffic is&#13;
concentrated in the Central Region within a 150-km radius of Bangkok, highlighting Bangkok's leading&#13;
role as the center of government, commerce, industry and transport. Over 90% of non-urban traffic&#13;
(excluding motorcycles) is concentrated on national roads, with the remainder on rural roads. The national&#13;
roads show great variations in traffic density. About 15% of the roads account for about 55% of the&#13;
traffic, and about 35% of the road length accounts for about 70% of the traffic. In 1993, some 16,600&#13;
km of national roads had traffic of less than 1,000 vpd (Table 5), 31,400 km had traffic between 1,000&#13;
and 6,000 vpd, while about 6,000 km had traffic over 6,000 vpd. Medium (6 wheel trucks) and heavy&#13;
trucks (10 wheel trucks, full- and semi-trailers) in general account for between 25 % and 60% of the total&#13;
vehicle-kms. Only some 1,600 km of the network have four lanes or more, while the 6,000 km of roads&#13;
with traffic over 6,000 vpd would soon need to have four lanes or more. DOH's Seventh Highway Plan&#13;
calls for an increase in the number of lanes of some 3,250 km of national roads (1,891 km of four-laning&#13;
and 1,358 km of other widening schemes such as climbing- or passing-lanes), while the widening of&#13;
highways in the 6th Plan carry-forward accounts for 1,246 km.&#13;
Trucking Industry&#13;
1.    About 400,000 trucks now operate in Thailand but many other types of vehicles, including pick-&#13;
ups, act as commercial vehicles. Most of these vehicles are owner-operated, although a few firms have&#13;
several hundred vehicles each. The Government-owned Express Transport Organization (ETO), which&#13;
has a monopoly for certain services, has about 1,200 trucks. The 834 common carrier truck license&#13;
holders, including ETO, control the operation of 37,000 trucks. Overall, the truck fleet is old and makes&#13;
use of recycled 10 wheel trucks which are usually not fuel efficient nor environmentally friendly. At&#13;
present, some 3,700 trucks or 1 % of the total fleet are articulated vehicles which can carry high payloads&#13;
with lower axle loads than the typical 10 wheel truck. The trucking industry has been the subject of a&#13;
two-phased study completed in 1988 with financing under previous Bank-assisted projects.&#13;
2.     Trucking Regulation. Although the trucking industry is essentially free of economic regulation,&#13;
periodic and regular pressure is applied for more regulation, purportedly to prevent destructive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-                                Annex 1&#13;
Page 3 of 10&#13;
competition within the industry or with the railway and to reduce the high percentage of empty truck&#13;
hauls, which waste fuel and other resources. Some of these initiatives attempt to prevent competitors&#13;
from entering the free transport market. Regulatory inroads have, however, been made by ETO, which&#13;
has trucking monopolies for: (a) transport of freight landed at Klong Toey port; (b) a number of&#13;
Government-specified commodities; and (c) until recently, transit traffic to and from Laos and Malaysia.&#13;
However, ETO was not given exclusive rights to serve the new Laem Chabang port on the Eastern&#13;
Seaboard. Until recently the ETO had been expanding, despite generally acknowledged poor performance&#13;
in cost and services. In the face of increased private sector competition, ETO has been experiencing&#13;
financial losses for the past two years, but is likely to make a small profit in fiscal year 1994, following&#13;
personnel and operational changes. The size of ETO's work force (over 4,000 staff) has protected it from&#13;
reform. ETO, however, represents a small part of the trucking industry as its total tonnage transported&#13;
is only about 2% of total road freight transport demand.&#13;
3.    A peak-period truck ban has been in force in Bangkok for about 20 years. The industry appears&#13;
to have adjusted its practices to fit in with the ban, but has vigorously resisted regular attempts to have&#13;
the times and area of the ban expanded.  About two years ago, the Ministry of Transport and&#13;
Communications (MOTC) received three proposals for the establishment of truck terminals in outer parts&#13;
of Bangkok. These are still under consideration. Prior to a final decision being made the LTD is&#13;
planning to engage a consultant to conduct an Environmental Impact Assessment. as required by law.&#13;
Thie economic benefits of truck terminals are by no means clear, but any benefits would be rapidly eroded&#13;
if use of truck terminals was made compulsory.&#13;
4.     Truck Overloading. Overloading of trucks is fairly common and has implications for road safety,&#13;
maintenance and the enforcement of road traffic laws. Truck overloading, however, is essentially limited&#13;
to the major bulk commodities, which are carried on ten-wheel trucks largely on the major trunk&#13;
corridors. There are ten permanent truck weighing stations in the national highway system, all operated&#13;
by DOH with the participation of its Highway Police Patrol. In addition, DOH has some 35 mobile&#13;
teams with portable scales. The Trucking Industry Study concluded that existing axle loads and gross&#13;
veliicle weight limits should be increased, although to date the Government has retained the existing&#13;
maximum axle weight of 9 tons. The composition of the truck fleet is, however, changing. While six-&#13;
wheel trucks are the main offenders for overloading, increased use is being made of multi-axle trucks&#13;
which, while permitting heavier loads, may also distribute the loads so that maximum axle loads are&#13;
acceptable.&#13;
Inter-city and Rural Bus Transport Industry&#13;
5.     The country's inter-city and rural bus fleet consists of about 60,000 vehicles, about half of which&#13;
are light buses (vehicles with more than seven passengers) and half are heavy buses. In general, the&#13;
buses are operated by very small operators with few management skills. A two-phased study to assess&#13;
the efficiency and effectiveness of the bus industry, the Study of Intercity and Rural Bus Transport&#13;
(SIRB). carried out under the Second Provincial Roads Project (Ln. 22311-TH), estimated that in 1989&#13;
the industry had the following structure: one company, the Government-owned Transport Company (TC),&#13;
had 592 buses; 20 firms had more than 100 buses; 400 firms had an average of about 24 buses each;&#13;
45,300 firms had one vehicle each; and 490 license holders had no vehicles.&#13;
6.     For historical reasons, there is a high incidence of affiliation or "middle men" in the industry.&#13;
The SIRB estimated that 58% of all bus license holders own no buses of their own but rather subcontract&#13;
the rights to operate to affiliates. Only 14% of all license holders own all the buses operated under their&#13;
licenses. As policy, TC operates only 9% of the 6,600 buses permitted on their licenses. The SIRB&#13;
concluded that this extent of affiliation in the industry should be reduced over time as it is a major barrier&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-29-                                 Annex 1&#13;
Page 4 of 10&#13;
to encouraging the development of larger operators with better management and operational skills.&#13;
7.     Thailand's regions are well served by the intercity and rural bus systems. The inter-city bus&#13;
services running regular fixed route services are largely operated by the private sector, although the State&#13;
Enterprise Bus Operator (the Transport Company) monopolizes all of the 188 routes operating between&#13;
Bangkok and the provinces, using some 4,600 buses. However, the Transport Company sub-contracts&#13;
about 90% of the services to private operators. In addition, tourist buses and charter tours are operated&#13;
by private bus operators on non-fixed routes, using approximately 6,000 buses. There is also a well&#13;
developed system of bus services operating between the major provinces and within provinces.&#13;
C. Highway Administration&#13;
8.     The MOTC, through DOH, is responsible for the administration, planning, construction and&#13;
maintenance of the national road systems (Chart 1). MOTC's Land Transport Department (LTD) is also&#13;
responsible for initiating and administering legislation on the use of roads, including registration of all&#13;
vehicles and the licensing of commercial vehicles. The 73 provinces and municipalities, under the&#13;
Ministry of Interior (MOI), are generally responsible for the rural roads, assisted by a number of MOI&#13;
agencies.&#13;
Departrnent of Highwavs&#13;
9.     The DOH is responsible for the classification of all roads and road systems, for the initiation of&#13;
legislation concerning the construction, maintenance and protection of all roads and for the preparation&#13;
and implementation of programs and budgets for the development and maintenance of national roads.&#13;
While other government departments and agencies also build and maintain roads for special purposes,&#13;
DOH's highways activities cover about 66% of total investments in the sector. The Department's&#13;
expenditures for 1987-93 is shown in Table 6.&#13;
10.   The DOH is a well-organized and well-operated agency, which functions with considerable&#13;
autonomy. Its organization (Chart 2) is adequate, comprising 18 divisions at the Bangkok headquarters,&#13;
15 field divisions and 85 highway districts located in the provinces. In addition, the Highway Patrol&#13;
Police, under the operational control of the Police Department, is under DOH for administrative and&#13;
budgetary purposes.&#13;
11.   The DOH's staff of about 8,400, including about 1,400 professionals, is adequate to carry out&#13;
its functions and responsibilities. The professional staff, 840 of whom are engineers, is largely capable&#13;
and experienced. Most of the staff are civil servants, with their remuneration determined by government&#13;
salary scales.&#13;
12.    During the last 10-12 years, DOH has gradually improved its training facilities and programs.&#13;
This effort culminated under recent Bank-assisted highway sector projects which financed a new training&#13;
center at DOH's headquarters and another at Chon Buri. These projects have also financed equipment&#13;
and training aids as well as consultant services to assist in the review and revision of course contents and&#13;
curricula. In the past few years (1992-94), about 120 courses have been given annually, each of 1-65&#13;
days duration and attended by between 4,000 and 6,000 staff. In addition, with some bilateral assistance,&#13;
DOH has trained a few hundred highway officials from Laos and Myanmar and has plans to offer similar&#13;
services to Cambodia and Viet Nam. DOH's present training facilities and programs are considered&#13;
mostly adequate for its expected operations during the next few years, although further training needs will&#13;
be identified under the ongoing study of DOH's long-term strategy and institutional capacity, being&#13;
&#13;

carried out under loan 3446-TH. However, housing for teaching staff and improved outfitting (furniture,&#13;
equipment and teaching aids) of the center at Chon Buri is still required, especially if training of foreign&#13;
highway officials continues and expands, and the proposed project will therefore provide funds for this&#13;
purpose.&#13;
Depaitment of Land Transport&#13;
13.    The LTD's main responsibilities are the regulation of road transport and road use, including route&#13;
and operator licensing of commercial vehicles and the setting of tariff ceilings for road transport,&#13;
standards of road vehicles and equipment, vehicle safety and emission inspections and the setting and&#13;
collection of road user taxes. LTD's organization (Chart 3) is adequate for the discharge of its present&#13;
duties, with 11 divisions at the Bangkok headquarters and 76 provincial offices. It has about 5,300 staff,&#13;
of whorn about 3,000 are involved in private vehicle registration, driver licensing and related functions&#13;
conferred on LTD after it took over responsibility for administering the Motor Vehicles Act in 1988.&#13;
Of the baiance of the staff, about 700 have college degrees. LTD has difficulty in attracting suitably&#13;
qualified stath, particularly those with previous training in transport-related matters. As a result, staffing&#13;
levels of many LTD Divisions, primarily in areas requiring tertiary eduction, are well below their&#13;
pernitted maximum; some sections have only half of their normal staffing.&#13;
14.    LTD's new responsibility for private vehicles and increased role in vehicle inspection and&#13;
enforcement require the Department to fill existing staff vacancies with trained personnel and in some&#13;
areas to recruit additional staff. Recruitment of additional staff as well as continuous training of new and&#13;
existing staff will also be needed in conjunction with the upcoming introduction of LTD's computerized&#13;
Management Information System (MIS), if the system's potential is to be realized.&#13;
15.    Despite efforts to increase its capabilities, LTD needs further strengthening in order to keep pace&#13;
with the country's rapidly increasing motorization and road use. Ongoing Bank-assisted highway projects&#13;
are providing LTD with training and equipment for vehicle inspections while the proposed project would&#13;
finance technical assistance and equipment to strengthen LTD's staff in specified functions.&#13;
16.    A greatly expanded training effort is, however, needed. A program should therefore be prepared&#13;
to address both the vocational and tertiary training needs of LTD staff, using a range of training delivery&#13;
methods to reach the various levels of the organization.  The latter might include: (a) overseas&#13;
observation trips for senior managers; (b) short courses for new staff and refresher courses for existing&#13;
staff, accompanied by manuals and texts in Thai; (c) post-graduate training study assistance for selected&#13;
staff; and (d) possible support for relevant training programs at local universities. In particular, formal&#13;
training courses are needed in: transport planning, administration, and economics; vocational areas such&#13;
as impfoved vehicle inspection; use of computers at a basic and advanced level; automotive engineering;&#13;
control of vehicle noise and exhaust emissions, etc. The main objective of the program should be to&#13;
assist the Department effectively fulfill its increasingly important role as a manager and administrator of&#13;
the nation's vehicle fleet and its use.&#13;
D. Highway Planning and Environmental Assessment&#13;
17.    Planning. The DOH Planning Division prepares its highway development programs and drafts&#13;
annual budget proposals for national roads on the basis of highway sector objectives included in the&#13;
Government's five-year development plans as well as proposals put forward by DOH field offices, the&#13;
provincial authorities and other ministries and departments. Prior to being accepted, all project proposals&#13;
are subjected to a field reconnaissance, during which DOH collects data for a preliminary assessment of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31-                                Annex I&#13;
Page 6 of 10&#13;
the works required, their cost and project economics. The Planning Division then ranks the proposals&#13;
in approximate order of priority and prepares a draft development plan, based on economic criteria. For&#13;
smaller projects, particularly those financed wholly by the Government, little further preparation is&#13;
undertaken, other than detailed engineering. For major construction projects, detailed feasibility studies&#13;
are carried out, usually by consultants due to DOH's limited resources. DOH has been relying on joint&#13;
ventures of foreign and local consultants to help in preparing its main work programs; however, with&#13;
Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance, it is now establishing a modern pavement management and&#13;
planning system which allow it to be mostly self-sufficient in planning, although local consulting&#13;
assistance will be required at times of peak workloads.&#13;
18.   Draft five-year development plans prepared by DOH for national roads (and by MOI for rural&#13;
roads) are reviewed by the inter-ministerial Land Transport Coordination Committee, under MOTC, to&#13;
ensure adequate coordination and balance. The draft plans are then reviewed by the National Economic&#13;
and Social Development Board (NESDB) for the size of the total program and its relationship to national&#13;
priorities. The plans must then be approved by the Cabinet. After approval, the plans are periodically&#13;
reviewed and revised to reflect changed priorities and availability of funds.&#13;
19.   The current 7th Road Improvement Plan (7th Plan) period is from October 1991 to September&#13;
1996 (FY92-FY96), but it has not been formally approved.  The Draft 7th Plan contains about 15,000&#13;
km of road improvement or upgrading, with an estimated cost of 95,206 million bahts (in 1990 prices).&#13;
Over 60 per cent of the budget was allocated to the strategic components of the plan, including widening,&#13;
new links and the initial sections of the proposed motorway system. The remaining 40 per cent of the&#13;
budget was allocated to rehabilitation/reconstruction or paving projects, and the 7th Plan includes an&#13;
initial 200 km of the proposed national motorway network (144 km of Bangkok-Petchaburi route and 54&#13;
km of Chonburi-Map Ta Phut on the Eastern Seaboard area) at an estimated cost of 14.8 billion Baht.&#13;
20.   Only some 20% of the 6th Plan program was completed during its plan period and many projects&#13;
that were begun during the 6th Plan period are still under implementation in the middle of the 7th Plan&#13;
period. Also, a number of projects included in the 6th Plan were carried over and started in the 7th Plan&#13;
period (but are still referred to as 6th Plan projects). The carry-over expenditures amount to some 75&#13;
billion Baht, of which about 80% are for new links and widening projects in the Central Region which&#13;
were added to the 6th Plan at its mid-term review in 1989. Thus, very few real 7th Plan projects have&#13;
been started and expenditures so far have been negligible.&#13;
21.   DOH is looking beyond its previous five-year horizon and beginning long-term investment&#13;
planning. With assistance from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), DOH has prepared&#13;
a strategic plan for development of a motorway network of over 4,000 km. Loan 3446-TH is providing&#13;
DOH with technical assistance which is presently formulating recommendations for a long-term strategic&#13;
plan to identify possible sources of investment financing, including the tolling of motorways and the&#13;
potential of private sector participation. The proposed project would provide DOH with technical&#13;
assistance and resources to implement the recommendations of the ongoing study.&#13;
22.   Environmental Assessment. The road widening and rehabilitation activities of the project focus&#13;
on works to be carried out on existing alignments and typically within the existing right-of-way which&#13;
are unlikely to cause significant impacts.  All sub-projects will be screened and appropriate EA&#13;
documentation prepared by DOH taking into consideration potential environmental impacts in compliance&#13;
with RTG and Bank EA guidelines. Minor and short term impacts which may arise during the&#13;
construction phase will be mitigated through the use of appropriate guidelines for design and construction.&#13;
In cases where property acquisition will be required, this will generally concern minor widening of right-&#13;
of-way in the vicinity of new interchanges. DOH has offered assurances that any resettlement will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32-                                Annex 1&#13;
Page 7 of 10&#13;
handled in accordance with Bank guidelines.&#13;
23.   A sectoral environmental assessment (SEA) has been prepared both to confirm the adequacy of&#13;
current practices and to suggest improvements/ strengthening needed and DOH has established a new&#13;
environmental unit to manage the DOH EA process. As a sector project, the preparation activities have&#13;
included a comprehensive assessment of RTG's environmental review process and capabilities for the&#13;
highway subsector (the SEA) which will lead to improved practices and enhanced capabilities, supported&#13;
by a. separate $5 million component under the project, including institutional strengthening of key sector&#13;
agencies to improve environmental management capacities based on the results of the sectoral EA. Bank&#13;
operational planning includes close supervision of the EA process as well as strengthening project&#13;
implementation. As DOH reaches the limits of its possibilities of widening existing highways within&#13;
existing rights-of-way, and increasingly seeks new highway/motorway alignments, it is important that&#13;
DOH capacities for environmental assessment and management be developed to deal with more significant&#13;
environmental issues.&#13;
E. Highwav Financing and Road User Charges&#13;
24.   Highwav Financing. The highway subsector is financed from (a) general budgetary revenues and&#13;
(b) foreign loans and grants. Road user taxes are not earmarked, except for the relatively small proceeds&#13;
from vehicle registration fees, which are distributed among the Police Department and the local&#13;
governments. Sections of three inter-urban roads were operated as toll roads until 1993 when toll&#13;
collection was abolished. However, DOH will consider instituting tolls on selected roads in the future.&#13;
In recent years, external funding of investments for national and provincial roads has amounted to around&#13;
9 % of total expenditures and about 15 % of road construction and improvement costs. The ADB, Japan's&#13;
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) and the World Bank have been the principal sources of&#13;
external financing and are expected to remain so through the Seventh Plan.&#13;
25.   The increasing need for more highway capacity, particularly for an extended interurban motorway&#13;
system, has caused the Government to seek additional sources of financing. Since traffic levels on the&#13;
proposed four-lane roads are normally sufficient to justify tolls, consideration is being given to the use&#13;
of tolls on these roads. The Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand (ETA) imposes tolls&#13;
on its network of urban expressways, including a recent Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) scheme to&#13;
encourage private financing of expressway development. Recognizing the potential for tolling, the&#13;
Government is taking steps to establish a rational approach to toll rate setting, and MOTC is expected&#13;
to become responsible for proposing appropriate toll levels. There is thus a need for assistance in&#13;
developing a methodology for determining such toll rates.&#13;
26.   Road User Charges. Although the Government does not directly link the level of road-related&#13;
taxes to road expenditures, a DOH study has shown that total road user revenues, principally from&#13;
customs and excise duties, more than cover annual expenditures for construction, maintenance and general&#13;
administration of the road network (Tables 7 and 8). An analysis of the distribution of tax revenues&#13;
compared with the costs irrmposed on the network, in terms of physical damage, by the various types of&#13;
vehicles reveals that trucks, particularly heavy trucks, are undercharged and do not pay adequately.&#13;
Furthermore, while automobiles, motorcycles and other light vehicles may contribute adequately with&#13;
regard to pavement damage, it is less clear whether the related charges on these vehicles represent the&#13;
costs of congesticn which they impose on the system. No analysis has been carried out on the use of road&#13;
taxes to encourage greater fuel efficiency and environmental improvements in vehicles and their use which&#13;
could enhance the effectiveness of recent regulatory initiatives on these issues. It should be noted,&#13;
however, that fuel prices, the principal instruments for such objectives, are lower in Thailand than in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 8 of 10&#13;
neighboring countries (Table 9).&#13;
27.    LTD is currently reviewing registration charges for all vehicles and will present proposals to the&#13;
Ministry of Finance. The proposed charges will take into account the purchase price of the vehicle and&#13;
its engine capacity. LTD's preferred option would greatly increase charges for all vehicles (by about&#13;
three times), particularly for heavy vehicles, and would be automatically updated each year (see Annex&#13;
5). It is expected that the Long Term Strategic Investment Study will address these concerns.&#13;
F. Hi,liway Engineering and Construction&#13;
28.    DOH's Location and Design Division is responsible for the engineering of national roads. In&#13;
recent years the division has undertaken a substantial part of such work itself, employing consultants&#13;
when needed but particularly for externally financed projects. Almost all the firms engaged in detailed&#13;
engineering are Thai, since domestPc consultants have expanded in numbers and capability in recent years.&#13;
Foreign consultants, employed only to a limited extent and chiefly on specialized studies, usually operate&#13;
in joint venture with Thai consultants and employ only a few key foreign staff.&#13;
29.    As the program of road improvements and new construction has increased in scope and&#13;
complexity (motorways, grade-separated interchanges), more of engineering has gradually been given to&#13;
consultants. However, under Loan 3446-TH DOH is procuring an up-to-date computer aided drafting,&#13;
design and engineering management (CADEM) system which will both increase and modernize DOH's&#13;
design capacity at the same time. Even with this increased capacity, at least 50% of DOH's engineering&#13;
design work will need to be carried out by consultants.&#13;
30.    DOH has a range of geornetric design standards for national roads which are appropriate to the&#13;
road ciass, terrain and traffic volumes. It has also established design standards for use by the MOI&#13;
agencies charged with this task. For the design of flexible pavements and overlays, DOH uses the U.S.&#13;
Asphalt Institute's method, one of the most conservative methods in conmmon use, taking into account&#13;
observed and measured existing condition and traffic volumes and estimated loadings projected for the&#13;
next seven years. However, designs for 15 year traffic loadings are also prepared, and the initial (seven&#13;
year) thickness determined so that the additional pavement thickness required for carrying the traffic from&#13;
year 7 through year 15 is within a practical range for asphaltic concrete overlays. The result is that&#13;
pavements are somewhat over-designed when compared to practices in most other developing countries.&#13;
31. About 90% of DOH construction is by contract. The rest is by force account through DOH's&#13;
National and Special Highways Construction Divisions. This construction includes the improvement of&#13;
sorne existing national roads and of some rural roads to be incorporated into the national road system,&#13;
usually for training purposes in eight training centers set up with bilateral aid. Rural road construction&#13;
is now also predominantly by contract. Some small projects, undertaken by the provinces, districts and&#13;
groups of villages, are largely constructed by force account with a high proportion of hand labor. Even&#13;
though the DOH started a study on the reduction of direct labor and further increase of contracted works,&#13;
it is expected to need several years to realize it.&#13;
32.   The Thai industry has evolved during the past 20 years or so from infancy to maturity, and in&#13;
1993 the Thai Contractors' Association had about 800 members. The industry's growth is partly due to&#13;
a 1964 decision of DOH to increase the volume of highway construction by contract and to reduce its&#13;
force account works. Thai contractors have in general performed satisfactorily and the quality of work&#13;
has usually been good. The evolution of the domestic industry can be attributed to the initiative of local&#13;
entrepreneurs, fostered by the Government's policy of using competitive bidding to award contracts for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
.34                                Annex 1&#13;
Page 9 of 10&#13;
an overwhelming proportion of its large and continuous stream of road works. International competitive&#13;
bidding by prequalified firms is normally reserved for contracts financed by external sources and for&#13;
specialized construction work. Construction supervision is usually carried out by DOH, which, over the&#13;
years, has developed an efficient system to coordinate project execution. Local and foreign consultants&#13;
are used extensively on foreign-financed projects, with the role of foreign consultants confined to overall&#13;
management and assistance with special problems.&#13;
G. Highway Maintenance and Rehabilitation&#13;
33.   DOH is responsible for maintenance of the national road system while maintenance of most rural&#13;
roads is the responsibility of the 73 provinces, often with assistance from MOI and the municipalities.&#13;
Roads for the operation of irrigation projects are maintained by the Royal Irrigation Department, and&#13;
some national defense roads, mainly in the frontier areas, are maintained by the army.&#13;
34.   DOH's maintenance activities are planned and supervised by its Maintenance Division and carried&#13;
out by its 15 field divisions and 85 field districts. Most routine maintenance operations are performed&#13;
directly by the field districts, and periodic maintenance is done by contract under the supervision of the&#13;
field divisions and districts. Large-scale foreign-financed periodic maintenance and rehabilitation works&#13;
are carried out by contract and supervised by DOH headquarters.&#13;
35.   DOH's ability to organize and perform road maintenance has greatly improved over the last ten&#13;
years. A highway maintenance study carried out in 1976 under the Fifth Highway Project established the&#13;
framework for the maintenance of national and provincial roads. During the period 1978-81, under the&#13;
Sixth Highway Project, technical assistance was provided to help DOH set up an internal maintenance&#13;
equiprront hiring system (tl'e Revolving Fund); the system's goals are to improve the efficiency of&#13;
equipment management and utilization and to provide for the prompt supply of spare parts and funding&#13;
of the regular replacement of worn-out equipment. Although limited operation of the fund began in 1983,&#13;
it was not fully operational until 1988 when the required legal, administrative and financial arrangements&#13;
had been completed.&#13;
36.   DOH has developed two new systems; a Pavement Management System (PMS) to help its&#13;
Maintenance Division in assigning priorities for maintenance of paved roads under its control and a&#13;
Bridge Management System which serves as data-base in assigning priorities of bridge maintenance and&#13;
rehabilitation.&#13;
37.   The national network is in reasonable condition. In 1993, some 62% of the paved network was&#13;
rated good, 20% fair and 18% poor (Table 3), but the condition of the network's high-volume corridors&#13;
is somewhat better. Nonetheless, an important part of the system is approaching the end of its design life&#13;
and is increasingly in need of major repairs and rehabilitation as the network ages and as traffic volumes&#13;
and loadings increase much faster than anticipated at the design stage. Furthermore, until about 1985,&#13;
expenditures on road maintenance and rehabilitation were often below the levels needed to prevent general&#13;
deterioration of the road network. While the over-designing of pavements (para. 30) counteracts some&#13;
of the potential pavement damage from high traffic volumes and overloading, DOH estimates that during&#13;
each of the next five years, some 2,550 km of the network will need to be rehabilitated and about 2,290&#13;
km upgraded to paved standard; this indicates that more than 5% of the network will annually require&#13;
major improvement during the Seventh Plan period.&#13;
38.   DOH's road maintenance expenditures were inadequate until about 1985 when expenditures began&#13;
generally to match requirements. Maintenance expenditures in the Seventh Plan amounted to about&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-35-                                Aimex 1&#13;
Page 10 of 10&#13;
US$3,900 and 4,400 per km in 1992 and 1993, respectively and are planned to increase to about&#13;
US$8,000 per km in 1996. Together with the significant amount of rehabilitation and upgrading works&#13;
planned during the Seventh Plan period, these allocations are considered satisfactory.&#13;
39.    The Maintenance Division has started a program to pave shoulders of national roads, mainly on&#13;
sections within 15 km from major cities, 10 km from small cities and five km from villages, where there&#13;
are more bicycles and slow moving vehicles. This program is proving successful in shifting slow moving&#13;
traffic from the pavement proper to the shoulders and consequently contributes to increasing the capacity&#13;
and safety of these sections. The Division estimates that necessary budget for this program is 2 billion&#13;
Baht and that it will take 10 years to implement.&#13;

The Royal Thai Government's&#13;
Action Plan for Controlling Motor Vehicle Emissions&#13;
and Noise&#13;
1.    The Royal Thai Government in 1991 adopted an Action Plan to Reduce Vehicle Emissions and&#13;
Noise Pollution. That Action Plan was initiated with technical assistance under the Third Highway Sector&#13;
Project (Loan 3220-TH). Implementation of elements of the Action Plan begun in earnest under the&#13;
Thailand Fourth Highway Sector Project (Loan 3446-TH), and financing for additional elements would&#13;
be provided under the proposed Fifth Highway Sector Project. Technical assistance in implementing the&#13;
Action Plan is presently being supplied by consultants with funding from bilateral sources and from a&#13;
Japanese Grant administered by the World Bank. A second Japanese Grant has recently been approved&#13;
to support further work in the air quality area.&#13;
2.    Since 1991, the Royal Thai Government has made substantial progress in implementing the Action&#13;
Plan. Notable advances have been made in monitoring of air quality and noise levels, the establishment&#13;
of emissions standards for new vehicles, supplying unleaded gasoline and reducing the use of leaded&#13;
gasoline in Thailand, and the use of low-smoke lubricating oil for two-stroke motorcycles. Significant&#13;
progress has also been made toward implementing a vehicle inspection program - perhaps the most critical&#13;
component of the emissions control program. Nonetheless, much work remains to be done.&#13;
3.    The present revised and updated version of the Action Plan reflects the experiences gained to date&#13;
on the implementation of actions under the Fourth Highway Sector Project and ongoing discussions with&#13;
Bank missiops in the preparation of the proposed project. The Action Plan includes a balanced mix of&#13;
policies and investments to reduce the adverse impacts of motorized transport on air quality and noise&#13;
levels nationwide, and especially in the Bangkok Metropolitan Area. These measures can be grouped into&#13;
the following major categories:&#13;
i     air quality monitoring and planning;&#13;
*     epidemiological studies of air pollution effects on health;&#13;
*     improved fuels and lubricants;&#13;
*     alternative, cleaner fuels for vehicles;&#13;
*     emissions and noise standards for new and in use vehicles;&#13;
*     periodic vehicle inspection and maintenance;&#13;
*     on-road enforcement of vehicle emissions standards;&#13;
*     public information on air pollution and the role of vehicles;&#13;
*     traffic management.&#13;
In addition, the Government is continuing its efforts in mass transit and has recently expanded the scope&#13;
of the Action Plan to address water-borne transport in Bangkok, including measures to reduce pollutant&#13;
emissions and noise.&#13;
ACTION PLAN FORMULATION AND OVERSIGHT&#13;
4.    Primary responsibility for air quality policy and oversight of air quality programs lies with the&#13;
Department of Pollution Control (DPC) within the Ministry of Science, Technology, and the Environment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-47-&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 2 of 17&#13;
(MOSTE). In formulating the vehicJe emission control programs contained in this Action Plan, DPC has&#13;
benefitted from technical assistance Drovided under the Japanese Grant. In addition to a number of&#13;
focussed technical assistance projects, the proposed Fifth Highway Project includes financing for&#13;
additional long-term, full-time, senior-level advisory support to DPC for policy development and&#13;
evaluation, implementation support and supervision, and ongoing development of the Action Plan.&#13;
5.    Other agencies with important responsibilities under the Action Plan are the Ministry of Transport&#13;
and Comnnunications (MOTC). especially its Land Transport Department (LTD); the Thai Industrial&#13;
Standards Institute (TISI) and the Fuel Oil Division within the Ministry of Industry (MOI); and the&#13;
National Energy Policy Office (NEPO) within the Office of dhe Prime Minister. Responsibility for&#13;
coordinating the implementation of this and the other two Action Plans (dealing with Traffic Safety and&#13;
Road Transport Efficiency) lies with the Action Plans Coordinating Unit within MOTC. This unit works&#13;
closely with DPC and LTD. Continued Bank financing for the Action Plans Coordinating Unit would&#13;
be provided under the Fifth Highway Project, as would financing for the costs of technical assistance on&#13;
vehicle emissions issues for LTD. The ADB has also agreed to finance selected elements of the Action&#13;
Plan and the RTG budget will there by far the largest share of the estimated implementation cost of these&#13;
initiatives.&#13;
MONITORING AND PLANNING&#13;
6.    The monitoring and planning component of the Government's Action Plan is intended to provide&#13;
DPC with the full range of tools and information needed to monitor existing air quality levels and to plan&#13;
for attaining healthy levels of air quality. This component comprises the establishment of air quality&#13;
standards, expansion of the existing air quality monitoring network, and development and validation of&#13;
air quality models based on accurate emissions inventories. In addition, DPC would begin taking the first&#13;
steps toward developing a similar capability with regard to ambient noise levels. Monitorable indicators&#13;
for this action program are suggested below and will be agreed with key RTG agencies not later than&#13;
during tlhe initial annual review of the progran (April 1996).&#13;
7.    Air quality standards - The Royal Thai Government has established air quality standards for a&#13;
number of pollutant species. In 1993, a consultant study funded by Japanese Grant in connection with&#13;
the Fourth Highway Project reviewed the Thai ambient air quality standards and made recommendations.&#13;
These reconmmendations are presently under consideration by an inter-agency committee. It is expected&#13;
that revised ambient air quality standards based on these recommendations are will be presented to the&#13;
National Environment Board by early 1996.&#13;
Monitorable Indicators;&#13;
Action by the National Environment Board adopting/rejecting the revised ambient air&#13;
quality standards (expected by April 1996).&#13;
8.    Air quality monitoring - Continuous monitoring of ambient air quality is necessary to identify air&#13;
quality problems and to track progress toward meeting air quality standards. The Department of Pollution&#13;
Control presently operates 32 fixed air quality monitoring stations nationwide, plus two portable stations.&#13;
DPC plans to increase the number of fixed monitoring sites to 62 stations nationwide by the end of 1997.&#13;
This will include 22 stations in Bangkok, 4 in the industrial area of Samut Prakhan, and others in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-48-&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 3 of 17&#13;
provinces surrounding Bangkok and in the other main cities and towns of the Kingdom. These will be&#13;
linked by electronic data communications to a central computer system in the DPC offices in Bangkok.&#13;
Design of this network has already been completed, with Swedish help, and a contract for the eight new&#13;
stations to be added has been signed from the 1995 Fiscal year budget. The remaining 22 stations will&#13;
be added in Fiscal 1996 and 1997.&#13;
9.     Data collected by the air quality monitoring system will be analyzed to determine the air quality&#13;
status cf each of the areas covered. DPC intends to publish the resulting characterizations in an annual&#13;
report. These data will serve as input to the air quality planning and management process within DPC&#13;
and other government organizations. It is also intended that the air-quality monitoring data will be&#13;
accessible on-line to other organizations (such as the BMA and EGAT) needing timely access to such&#13;
data. Added computer hardware and software to support this on-line data access will financed as part&#13;
of the current Action Plan.&#13;
Monitorable Indicators:&#13;
Number of air quality monitoring stations on-line and reporting data (annually)&#13;
Publication of annual report on air quality (annually)&#13;
Number of organizations having/using on-line access to air quality data (annually)&#13;
Air quality trends in Bangkok as revealed by ambient monitoring (annual updates)&#13;
10.   Emissions inventory and modeling - Ambient air quality data supplied by the monitoring network&#13;
will serve as input to a gridded air quality model. Other inputs to this model will include gridded&#13;
emissions inventory data, including stationary, mobile, and area sources. As part of the Swedish bilateral&#13;
assistance, the AIRVIRO emissions inventory and modeling software has been installed on a computer&#13;
at DPC headquarters, and DPC staff have been trained in the use of this software. Available data on&#13;
r:oint-source emissions, traffic patterns, etc. have been loaded into the emissions inventory model.&#13;
However, the model cannot yet accomplish accurate projections of emissions inventories and air quality,&#13;
due to the absence of reliable data on vehicle emission factors in Thailand. As part of the U.S. bilateral&#13;
assistance, a version of the U.S. MOBILE5 emissions model has been adapted to reflect Thai emissions&#13;
standards and vehicle fleet comnposition (modification known as MOBILE-Thai). However, lacking actual&#13;
emissicns measurerments on Thai vehicles, this model can give only a crude approximation of the likely&#13;
emissions. Further, MOBILE-Thai does not project particulate emissions, which are the pollutants of&#13;
greatest concern from mobile sources.&#13;
11.   A consultant study to update and improve the pollutant emissions inventory is planned to be&#13;
carried out in 1995, funded by the recently approved Japanese Grant. In addition, annual updates of&#13;
vehicle traffic and emissions estimates will be carried out by Chulalongkorn University.&#13;

12.   Vehicle emissions laboratory - A vehicle emissions laboratory has been constructed and will be&#13;
equipped as a component of the Fourth Highway Sector Project. This laboratory is to be operated by the&#13;
Land Transport Department (LTD) in cooperation with the Department of Pollution Control. The&#13;
emissions laboratory will be capable of and used for measuring emissions from all classes of vehicles,&#13;
from light motorcycles up to 20 ton trucks. The resulting data will constitute the first measurements of&#13;
in-use vehicle emissions in Southeast Asia, and will be used to define the vehicle emission factors in the&#13;
AIRVIRO software and MOBILE-Thai, as well as entering directly into the air quality planning process.&#13;
Continuing measurements of in-use vehicle emissions will be used to assess the effectiveness of vehicle&#13;
emission control measures, and to identify areas of shortfall for corrective action.&#13;
13.   Once the laboratory is fully functioning, emissions testing will be carried out by LTD and/or DPC&#13;
personnel, in accordance with an operating protocol to be agreed between the two agencies. Finance for&#13;
training, technical assistance, minor additional equipment, and spare parts to support the operation of the&#13;
emissions laboratorv for the first three years will be financed under the Action Plan.&#13;

14.   Noise monitoring and modeling - Like air pollution, ambient levels of noise pollution in Bangkok&#13;
and other principal cities of the Kingdom are of significant environmental concern. Vehicles are a major,&#13;
if not the major, source of environmental noise. The DPC recently acquired noise monitoring equipment.&#13;
Monitoring is conducted at eight fixed sites, and two mobile monitoring stations are available. Under&#13;
the proposed Fifth Highway Sector Project, financing would be provided for the acquisition of noise&#13;
modeling software, to be used primarily in assessing the environmental impact of proposed projects that&#13;
would generate noise. Technical assistance and training in noise evaluation and the use of the modeling&#13;
software would also be provided.&#13;

EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES&#13;
15.   The Bank's 1993 Country Economic Memorandum for Thailand identified air pollution -&#13;
especially lead and PM1O - as an important public health problem. An earlier study by the U.S. AID&#13;
came to the same conclusion. These studies were based on epidemiological data mostly from the U.S.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

and European sources. Because of the difference in lifestyles, climate, and income levels between the&#13;
U.S./Europe and Southeast Asia, the health impacts of a given level of pollution may be different. For&#13;
examppie, residents of Bangkok tend to spend much more time on the street each day than do Americans&#13;
or Europeans, and may thus suffer greater impacts from the high levels of pollution that occur there.&#13;
Epidemiological studies will be carried out in Bangkok to better characterize the impact of major air&#13;
pollution (especially mobile-source PM1O emissions) on health.  Support for these studies will be&#13;
provided by the second Japanese Grant.&#13;

FUELS AND LUBRICANTS&#13;
16.   The component of the Government's plan dealing with fuels and lubricants has focussed on&#13;
improving the emissions characteristics of gasoline, diesel fuel, and two-stroke lubricating oil through&#13;
changes in specifications and investments in refinery process equipment. These measures have already&#13;
achieved significant success, and studies of possible future changes to further reduce vehicle emissions&#13;
are under way within the National Energy Policy Office. Improved monitoring and testing of fuel and&#13;
lubricant quality to ensure compliance with the specifications are also a significant focus of attention.&#13;
17.   Gasoline - The Government has moved aggressively over the last four years to introduce unleaded&#13;
gasolirne and to reduce the lead content of leaded gasoline. This has resulted in a marked decrease in&#13;
ambient lead concentrations in Bangkok. Sales of leaded regular gasoline will be completely eliminated&#13;
by December 1995.&#13;
Monitorable indicators:&#13;

18.   Diesel - Regulations limiting the sulfur content of diesel fuel are being phased in. Beginning&#13;
December 1995, the maximum sulfur content of diesel fuel will be limited to 0.25 % by weight. In 1997,&#13;
the limit will be reduced to 0.05%.  Some of the refinery investments necessary to meet the 0.05%&#13;
sulfur regulation are to be financed by the Bank's Bangchak Refinery Project.&#13;
Monitorable indicators:&#13;

compliance with the limits on lead in gasoline and sulfur in diesel fuel, as well as other fuel quality&#13;
specifications. Limited technical assistance in performing these tasks has been provided by consultants&#13;
supported by the Japanese Grant. Finance for additional technical assistance and training for the Fuel&#13;
Oil Division to carry out its monitoring and enforcement responsibilities wouid be provided under the&#13;
Action Plan.&#13;

20.   Two-stroke lubricating oil - White smoke emission from two-stroke motorcycles is believed to&#13;
be a major contributor to the high ambient PMIO levels in Bangkok. To help reduce these emissions,&#13;
the Government in 1991 established regulations requiring the use of low-smoke lubricating oil. Despite&#13;
these regulations, white smoke remains a very significant and visible problem. Presently, "low smoke"&#13;
lubricating oil is defined by a Thai national standard, based on a smoke opacity test in a two-stroke&#13;
motorcycle. Consideration is being given to adopting the Japanese lubricating oil standard instead, which&#13;
is said to be more stringent (this standard has also been proposed to ISO as an international standard).&#13;
Motorcycle manufacturers have also expressed concern over the variation in quality of lubricating oils&#13;
actually found in the Thai market. Responsibility for verifying compliance with the two-stroke oil&#13;
standard lies with the TISI.&#13;
Monitorable indicators:&#13;

ALTERNATIVE FUELS&#13;
21.   Alternative fuels such as natural gas and LPG offer significant potential for reducing emissions,&#13;
especially of diesel particulate matter. LPG is widely used as a fuel for taxis and tuk-tuks, but the quality&#13;
of present LPG conversion systems is low, and emissions from converted vehicles are consequently high.&#13;
Eighty-two buses are presently operating on compressed natural gas, as part of a pilot program involving&#13;
PTT and the BMTA. PTT has also converted some light-duty vehicles to CNG operation. An ongoing&#13;
consultant study is preparing a plan to promote more widespread commercialization of clean, alternative&#13;
fuel vehicles. As part of this study, the consultant will be addressing the need for emissions and safety&#13;
regulations governing these vehicles. Funds have also been budgeted under the proposed Action Plan for&#13;
technical assistance to assist in carrying out the consultant recommendations. USAID is also assisting&#13;
RTG to explore a variety of electric battery-power option.&#13;

EMISSIONS STANDARDS FOR NEW AND IN-USE VEHICLES&#13;
22.   Existing and proposed emissions standards and dates of effectiveness are listed in Table 1.&#13;
Emissions standards for new vehicies are promulgated and enforced by the Thai Industrial Standards&#13;
Institute (TISI). Standard-setting is based on the recommendations of an inter-agency committee. This&#13;
committee includes representatives of the Department of Pollution Control, Land Transport Department,&#13;
TISI, and the automotive industry, as well as academic experts in vehicle emissions. Recently, DPC&#13;

23.   Passenger cars and trucks - Regulations requiring gasoline passenger cars and trucks to be&#13;
equipped with catalytic converters took effect in January, 1992. These regulations did not require&#13;
vehicles so equipped to meet any specified emission level, however. To rectify this situation, TISI&#13;
adopted a level 1 emissions standard based on ECE R15-04 emission regulations. Compliance with this&#13;
standard is presently voluntary. It appears that the Level 1 standard will not become mandatory. Instead,&#13;
the Level 2 standard, based on the ECE R83, will become mandatory. Compliance with the Level 2&#13;
standard is required from January, 1996 for light-duty gasoline vehicles. The Government intends to&#13;
adopt Level 3 standards based on the European ECE R83-01 emission regulations, but the timing for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-53-&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 8 of 17&#13;
mandatory compliance with this standard has not yet been established. Level I emissions standards for&#13;
light-duty diesel vehicles, also based on ECE R83, are scheduled to become mandatory in January 1996.&#13;
These standards, for the first time, establish limits on black smoke and particulate emissions from light-&#13;
duty diesel vehicles. This is an extremely significant step, as smoke and PM emissions from these&#13;
vehicles are presently very high, and are considered to be significant contributors to the high ambient&#13;
PM1O levels in Bangkok. It is intended that stricter Level 2 standards based on ECE R83-01 will become&#13;
mandator) in the future, but timinlg for these remains to be determined by the Cabinet. A consultant&#13;
study of diesel emissions standards is presently under way, with funding provided under the Japanese&#13;
Grant. The results of this study are expected to affect the timing and levels of future diesel emissions&#13;
standards.&#13;
Monitorable indicators:&#13;
Adoption of emission regulations as scheduled&#13;
Sales of vehicles meeting new emissions standards.&#13;
24.   Motorcycles - Level I limits on motorcycle emissions of CO and HC + NOx are already in effect,&#13;
and data from manufacturers indicate that these have resulted in nearly a 50% fall in emnissions of these&#13;
pollutants by new motorcycles. Level 2 limits, to take effect next year, will result in further incremental&#13;
improvement. Agreement has recently been reached between the Ministry of Science, Technology, and&#13;
the Environment (MOSTE) and the Ministry of Industry (MOI) on Level 3 standards to be phased in&#13;
between t 997 and 1999. These new standards will likely require two-stroke motorcycles to use catalytic&#13;
converters to control HC emissions.&#13;
25.   A consultant study of motorcycle emission standards for Thailand was completed in February,&#13;
1994. This study identified particulate emissions (in the form of white smoke) from two-stroke&#13;
motorcycles as a significant environmental concern which has not been addressed by motorcycle emission&#13;
standards to date. Agreement in principle has been reached with the motorcycle industry to limit white&#13;
smoke emissions to 30 % opacity or less in conjunction with the Level 3 emissions standards. Additional&#13;
research will also be carried out to define a basis for setting Level 4 standards, which would include&#13;
further limits on emissions of particulate matter. This research will include actual PM measurements on&#13;
Thai motorcycles.&#13;
Monitorable indicators:&#13;
Adoption of emission regulations as scheduled.&#13;
Sales of vehicles meeting new emissions standards.&#13;
26.   Heavy-duty trucks and buses - Contemplated heavy-duty engine emissions standards for Thailand&#13;
are based on the steady-state ECE 13-mode procedure. This test is much less expensive than the&#13;
alternative U.S. heavy-duty transient cycle, but may be less effective in controlling emissions under real-&#13;
world conditions of transient operation. Level 1 emissions standards, based on ECE regulation R49-01,&#13;
went into effect in January, 1995, and Level 2 standards (equal to the EEC "Euro 1" standard level) are&#13;
scheduled for July, 1996. The consultant study of diesel emissions standards referred to above also&#13;
addresses heavy-duty engines. The results of this study may affect the level and timing of future&#13;
emissions standards for these engines.&#13;

of which will be implemented during the Action Plan period.&#13;

28.   Testing and enforcement - Responsibility for enforcing compliance with new-vehicle emission&#13;
standards lies with TISI. A set of vehicle emissions test cells for this purpose is under construction at&#13;
TISI's Industrial Standards Laboratory, and is expected to be operational by the end of 1994. Presently,&#13;
vehicle emissions standards, as in Europe, require compliance only at the time the vehicle is new, and&#13;
include a combination of prototype certification and testing of samples from actual production. It is&#13;
anticipated that future emission regulations may require, as in the U.S., that vehicles continue to meet&#13;
emissions standards over their useful lives when properly maintained. Such regulations would require&#13;
an expansion of the enforcement program to include in-use emissions surveillance.&#13;

CONTROLLING IN-USE VEHICLE EMISSIONS AND NOISE&#13;
29.   Measures to reduce emissions from vehicles already in use are an important complement to new-&#13;
vehicle emission standards. Such measures offer virtually the only hope for significant improvements in&#13;
air pollution in the near term, and are also needed in the long term to ensure that the potential emissions&#13;
benefits of new-vehicle emission standards are not lost through poor maintenance, tampering with, or&#13;
removal of emission controls. Commercial vehicles are presently subject to periodic emission checks as&#13;
part of their licensing process. Additional measures have been initiated to control in-use emissions&#13;
including the definition of emissions standards and test procedure, establishment of a demonstration&#13;
inspection center, a program for on-road enforcement of vehicle emissions and noise limits, and a pilot&#13;
periodic inspection program for private vehicles in the Bangkok region.&#13;
30.   In-use standards and test procedures - A consultant study to recommend suitable emissions test&#13;
procedures and standards for in-use vehicles was carried out in 1993, with funding from the Japanese&#13;
Environmental Grant. This study developed test procedures suitable for use in roadside checks, as well&#13;
as in periodic vehicle inspections. The test procedures developed included checks for excessive white&#13;
smoke emissions from two-stroke motorcycles and black smoke emissions from diesel vehicles, as well&#13;
as HC and CO emissions. These tests were then applied to a sample of vehicles to characterize the&#13;
present distribution of emission levels in use. Based on these distributions, the consultants recommended&#13;
emission standards applicable to each vehicle class. These standards and test procedures are now being&#13;
considered by interagency committee responsible for coordinating vehicle inspections, and it is anticipated&#13;
that final test procedures and standards will soon be presented to the National Environment Board.&#13;

31.   Demonstration insDection center - Development of a demonstration inspection center (DIC) in the&#13;
Bangkok area for vehicle emissions and safety was included in the Fourth Highway Sector Project. The&#13;
center was intended to fulfill a number of purposes, including inspection of government vehicles, training&#13;
of inspectors for the contemplated private I/M program, preparation of undercover vehicles for quality-&#13;
control checks on the private I/M program, and serving as a referee facility to resolve disputes between&#13;
vehicle owners and the private inspectors. The center was intended to be used to "try out" and&#13;
demonstrate new I/M methods. Specifications for ICB of equipment for the center were prepared in 1993&#13;
by consultants funded under the ongoing Japanese Grant. These consultants also worked with LTD's staff&#13;
architect to develop the building design. Actual construction is planned to be undertaken in 1996, after&#13;
a suitable site is identified and approved.&#13;

32.   Inspection of commercial vehicles - Commercial vehicles such as trucks, buses, and taxis are&#13;
subject to emission checks by LTD, as part of the annual inspection required for licensing. These checks&#13;
are presently not very effective due to shortages of equipment and inadequate inspector training and&#13;
supervision. For example, the rate at which heavy-duty diesel vehicles failed for excessive smoke in&#13;
LTD's inspections was about 2%, compared to a failure rate of more than 50% in checks of vehicle&#13;
randomly stopped on the road. Some of this shortfall is due to equipment shortages - if an inspection&#13;
station doesn't have a working smokemeter or emissions analyzer, the vehicles must be passed. Other&#13;
problems occur due to the use of incorrect testing procedures, which sometimes allow vehicles to pass&#13;
that should have failed. Financing for additional testing equipment is being provided under the Fourth&#13;
Highway Sector Project. The current Action Plan will also provide financing for a senior technical policy&#13;
advisor to assist LTD in improving its execution and oversight of the vehicle inspection process.&#13;

Responsibility for these checks is split between several government agencies. Military vehicles are&#13;
checked by the armed services themselves, and vehicles of the Ministry of Interior are checked by the&#13;
Police Department. Vehicles operated by the Ministry of Transport and Communications are checked&#13;
by LTD. DPC is responsible for checking all other Government vehicles. Comprehensive statistics on&#13;
failure and repair rates for these checks are not available.&#13;

34.   Pilot periodic I/M program for Bangkok - The Land Transport Department has launched a pilot&#13;
program for periodic inspection and maintenance of private light-duty vehicles and motorcycles for both&#13;
emissions and safety standards. The pilot covers annual inspections carried out at specially-licensed&#13;
private garages. The program is to be phased in, with initial inspections limited to motorcycles more than&#13;
seven years old and private cars more than ten years old. The program started July 1, 1994, and will&#13;
be evaluated after three years of operation. Based on the results of this evaluation, plans are to be&#13;

planning the national program would be provided under the current Action Plan.&#13;
35.   To date, some 178 inspection facilities had purchased the necessary equipment and received&#13;
approval to carry out inspections for the pilot program. Another 12 facilities had received conditional&#13;
approval, contingent upon acquisition of the necessary inspection equipment. Consultants funded by a&#13;
Japanese Grant provided technical assistance to LTD in establishing inspection, licensing, and QA/QC&#13;
procedures and in developing the administrative structure needed to oversee the inspection program.&#13;
Through September 1995 nearly 240,000 cars and 65,000 motorcycles have been inspected in the license&#13;
stations with the reported failure rate (requiring repair) being approximately 10%.&#13;

36.   On-road enforcement - On-road emissions enforcement serves as an important complement to&#13;
periodic inspection and maintenance programs. On-road enforcement of smoke regulations can be&#13;
especially effective, as screening for likely violators can easily be performed by eye. During 1995 DPC&#13;
has also initiated similar screening for gaseous emissions through remote sensing systems. By detecting&#13;
and citing the worst-offending vehicles on the road, these programs encourage vehicle owners to maintain&#13;
their vehicles properly, and help to guard against evasion of the periodic I/M  program.  Three&#13;
organizations presently exercise responsibility for on-road enforcement of vehicle emissions standards.&#13;
There are the Police, the Land Transport Department, and the Department of Pollution Control. The&#13;
authorizing legislation is different in each case, resulting in inconsistencies between the three agencies.&#13;
An interagency working group has been set up to coordinate enforcement activity, with the goal of&#13;
fielding combined teams of Police, DPC, and LTD personnel to carry out emissions checks and&#13;
enforcement. Equipment for on-road inspection teams, as well as technical assistance in developing and&#13;
implementing the on-road enforcement policy are included in the current Action Plan.&#13;
Monitorable Indicators&#13;
Average daily number of vehide inspection teams in operation&#13;
Number of vehicles inspected and number failing inspection&#13;
Number of vehicles appearing at inspection centers to dear violations; number not so&#13;
appearing within the required time&#13;
Average vehicle emission levels in use.&#13;
37.   Vehicle emissions inspection data network - To help ensure proper enforcement and prevent&#13;
evasion of the vehicle I/M and on-road emissions programs, it is planned to establish a data network for&#13;
vehicle emissions inspection and compliance data. Initially, this network will support the on-road&#13;
enforcement program - making it possible to ensure that vehicles cited by this program actually carry out&#13;
the required repairs. Data on whether a given vehicle had complied would be available on-line to vehicle&#13;
registration authorities, traffic police, and the vehicle inspection teams. Eventually, this network will be&#13;
expanded to include the results of periodic vehicle inspections as well. This will help to guard against&#13;
fraudulent vehicle inspection certificates, and to target vehicle inspection stations showing that show&#13;
unusual pass/fail rates for further investigation. Financing for hardware and software to support this&#13;
network would be provided under the current Action Plan.&#13;

38.   Mechanic training and certification - Effective enforcement of in-use vehicle emission standards&#13;
will create demand for emissions-related repairs. To assist the public in choosing qualified repair&#13;
technicians, LTD is in the process of establishing a mechanic training and certification process. Technical&#13;
assistance for developing the training curriculum was provided by consultants funded by the ongoing a&#13;
Japanese Grant.&#13;

PUBLIC INFORMATION&#13;
39.   A significant part of the air pollution problem in Bangkok is due to poor maintenance and/or&#13;
inappropriate vehicle operating practices, such as tampering with the maximum fuel setting on diesel fuel&#13;
injection pumps, using the wrong type of oil, or mixing more than the necessary amount of lubricating&#13;
oil with the fuel in two-stroke motorcycles. The vehicle I/M and especially the on-road enforcement&#13;
programs have substantial potential to reduce these unnecessary emissions. In order for these programs&#13;
to have their greatest effect, they will need to be complemented by a public information campaign&#13;
explaining the effect of air pollution on health, the role of vehicles in creating pollution, and specifically&#13;
addressing how vehicle owners and operators can minimize pollution from their vehicles. This campaign&#13;
will address such issues as using the proper quality and the recommended amounts of oil in two-stroke&#13;
engines, causes and solutions to diesel smoke problems, and the need to assure proper adjustment of the&#13;
air-fuel ratio in gasoline vehicles.&#13;

TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT&#13;
40.   Measures are presently being undertaken to improve traffic management and control in Bangkok.&#13;
These measures include the recent assignment of additional police officers to traffic duty, and the&#13;
implementation of Phase I of an area traffic control (ATC) scheme for Bangkok. Phase I includes 150&#13;
of the most congested intersections in Bangkok. Phase II will include additional intersections, and will&#13;
be implemented during 1996 to 1998. At the same time, the UNDP is funding implementation of a&#13;
network for closed-circuit TV monitoring of critical intersections for the Police Department.&#13;
Coordination between the BMA and the Police Department remains a critical problem in overall traffic&#13;
control - at present, the Police tend to override the automatic signal system, thus defeating its purpose.&#13;
ADB is also supporting the development of a comprehensive traffic management program for the Bangkok&#13;
area, being prepared by OCMRT with the assistant of professional consultant and public consultation&#13;
processes.&#13;

MASS TRANSIT&#13;
41.   A number of mass transit schemes have been proposed for Bangkok. Three have been approved,&#13;
and work has begun on some of these. The main mass transit projects now on the boards are the&#13;
Hopewell scheme (multi-level, elevated highways with electric train tracks between the two directions on&#13;
the lower level, the "skytrain" scheme, the Tanayong electric train proposal, and a similar proposal by&#13;
the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration. The recent decision by the Thai Cabinet to require all mass&#13;
transit schemes to use underground, rather than elevated rights-of-way in the central Bangkok area has&#13;
introduced significant uncertainty regarding the economic feasibility and timing of each of these&#13;
proposals. There is, in any event, little possibility that any of these proposals would actually reduce&#13;
traffic levels and air pollution in Bangkok. Suppressed travel demand is already significant, and would&#13;
be much greater by the time any of these projects could become operational. Thus, any traffic carried&#13;
by the mass transit system is likely to be incremental to, rather than a replacement for, automotive&#13;
traffic.&#13;

THAILAND&#13;
FIFTH HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT&#13;
Environmental Capacity Strengthening Program for DOH and OEPP&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.    The Department of Highways (DOH) is the main agency responsible for building and operation&#13;
of the national, special, and concessional highways as specified by the Highway Act of 1992. As of&#13;
1993, about 54,195 km of the national highways and 193 km of the special highways were built, of which&#13;
30% are located in the North, 25% in the Northeast, 27.5% in the Central, and 17.5% in the South.&#13;
About 4,345 km of inter-city motorways will be built during the next 20 years (at a construction cost of&#13;
about 355 billion baht) and 1,891 km of the main national highways will be widened (at a cost of about&#13;
45 billion baht) during the 7th Plan (1992-1996).&#13;
2.    The National Environmental Quality Act (NEQA) of 1992 requires that an environmental impact&#13;
assessment (EIA) study must be carried out for all special highway projects and the national highways&#13;
that go through the protected and/or sensitive areas. The EIA must be reviewed and approved by the EIA&#13;
Reviewing Committee through the Office of Environmental Policy and Planning (OEPP) of the Ministry&#13;
of Science, Technology, and Environment (MOSTE). EIA approval of the National Environment Board&#13;
(NEB) is required for the cabinet approval for investment of the project. In 1992, a Cabinet Resolution&#13;
ordered that an Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE) is required for widening of the roads and highways&#13;
that go through the protected and/or sensitive areas, while an environmental checklist is required for&#13;
rehabilitation and maintenance activities. The IEE can be reviewed and approved by OEPP, while the&#13;
checklist can be reviewed and approved by the Forestry Department.&#13;
3.    DOH has been carrying out the policy to protect the environment and minimize the negative&#13;
impacts while increasing efficiency of road transportation. During the detailed design, due consideration&#13;
is given to promote road safety, provide adequate drainage, and minimize soil erosion while&#13;
implementation of the activities is carried out during the construction stage. When land acquisition is&#13;
required, the acquisitionprocess is carried out following the guidelines specified by law. There are cases,&#13;
however, where special compensation and/or assistance is provided to those affected people despite the&#13;
lack of monetary provision by law. Due to the limited allocation of the government budget and limited&#13;
capacity and experience of DOH staff, the effectiveness of these activities is greatly hampered at present.&#13;
Given the future needs for road development and environmental protection, it is anticipated that DOH's&#13;
capacity to deal with the environmental issues, especially those related to safety, soil erosion, flooding,&#13;
and the delay in payment, must be strengthened as soon as possible.&#13;
4.    Similarly, OEPP's present capacity is inadequate compared to the need to carry out its tasks. For&#13;
the transportation sector, there are at least five major projects under the responsibility of DOH whose&#13;
EIAs were approved and effective monitoring for EIA compliance is required. OEPP intends to acquire&#13;
consulting services for this monitoring and reporting and at the same time to establish a system that can&#13;
effectively respond to the results. It is expected that during the next five years, DOH will prepare EIAs&#13;
for new projects, comprised of at least three motorways, two new highways, and 15 new and/or widening&#13;
road projects. These projects will require significant effort by OEPP in reviewing and monitoring of the&#13;
ETAs. In addition to the DOH projects, OEPP is also expected to review the EIAs and monitor&#13;
compliance of the transportation projects under the responsibility of other agencies, including the Public&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Works Department, the State Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand, the Metropolitan&#13;
Rapid Transit Authority, the State Railway of Thailand, and the Harbor Department.&#13;
5.     During the preparation of the Fifth Highway Sector Project under financial assistance of the&#13;
World Bank, a Sector Environmental Assessment (SEA) was prepared. The SEA identifies the sector&#13;
environmental issues and mitigation measures to alleviate the negative impacts due to implementation of&#13;
the road and highway projects under the responsibility of DOH. As a consequence, an Environmental&#13;
Process (EP, Figure 1) and an Environmental Assessment Strengthening Program (EASP) and its&#13;
implementation plan (Schedule 1) were established. The main policy and implementation guidelines&#13;
which are specified in this annex are intended to facilitate effective implementation of the EP/EASP and&#13;
to strengthen commnon understanding among the staff of DOH and other concerned parties.&#13;
B. DOH Objective and Strategy&#13;
6.    It is recognized that construction and/or widening of roads and highways may involve the&#13;
following issues:&#13;
a.     displacement of people, houses, and businesses and acquisition of private and/or&#13;
government land due to the need to establish the Right-Of-Ways (ROW);&#13;
b.     encroachment of the protected/sensitive areas, changes in hydrological and/or drainage&#13;
patterns, and negative impacts due to induced development;&#13;
c.     negative impacts (air/noise/vibration, erosion, safety, social) during road construction;&#13;
and&#13;
d.     negative impacts (air/noise/vibration, erosion, safety, social) during operation and&#13;
maintenance.&#13;
7.     DOH's objective is to protect the environment and to minimize the negative impacts on the&#13;
people. To achieve this objective, the main strategies to deal with the above issues are as follows:&#13;
a.     build up DOH capacity to facilitate effective administration and management of the&#13;
environmental issues;&#13;
b.     ensure full integration of the environmental concerns into every stage of the project&#13;
development cycle and adequate budget is allocated for the environrnental work;&#13;
c.     ensure adequate cooperation and coordination of DOH with OEPP and other concerned&#13;
agencies/entities, especially in the areas of preparing, reviewing, monitoring, and&#13;
evaluation of EIA/IEE and consultation with the affected groups and the public; and&#13;
d.    strengthen technical capacity and experience of DOH staff through training and assistance&#13;
of specialists.&#13;
C. DOH Programs ---[responsible units]&#13;
8.     According to the above strategies, the eight DOH programs identified in the EASP will be carried&#13;
out during the next four years (1996-1999) according to the guidelines described in the following&#13;
paragraphs.&#13;

9.    Program 1. Strengthen cooperation and coordination capacity within and outside DOH ---&#13;
[DOH]. The main activities include:&#13;
a.    establishing an Environmental Unit (EU) responsible for preparation of environmental&#13;
studies (ElA, IEE, checklist) and coordination of related activities within and outside&#13;
DOH. The unit is now under the Planning Division and comprises five technical staff&#13;
(economists, scientists, and technicians). Technical and coordination capacity of this unit&#13;
will be strengthened through training, increasing the number of personnel, and acquiring&#13;
equipment. Roles and responsibility of this unit include, but are not limited to, the&#13;
following:&#13;
prepare DOH environmental protection plan and policy and coordinate with other&#13;
concerned agencies on the environmnental matters;&#13;
prepare terms of reference (TOR) for the environmental studies (EIA, IEE,&#13;
checklist) and coordinate the implementation activities, including monitoring the&#13;
implementation of the mitigation measures;&#13;
coordinate the environmental work to belbeing carried out by concerned&#13;
divisions/offices of DOH, including monitoring and evaluation, to ensure full&#13;
integration of the environmental concerns into all stages of the project&#13;
development cycle;&#13;
serve as the secretariat to the DOH Environmental Committee;&#13;
b.    building EU capacity to carry out EA studies, screening, monitoring, and evaluation&#13;
through preparation of guidelines/manuals, training, and advisory services;&#13;
C.    procuring equipment and materials necessary for carrying out the tasks, including&#13;
computers and accessories; and&#13;
d.    conducting meetings/seminars/workshops.&#13;
10.   Program 2. Establish DOH environmental management capacity ---[DOH]. The main&#13;
activities include:&#13;
a.    Establishing an Environmental Committee (EC) responsible for developing environmental&#13;
strategy/plan/priority and oversee its implementation. The EC will be chaired by the&#13;
Director General or the Deputy Director General for Engineering and will comprise&#13;
director or his representatives of key divisions/offices. The EU will serve as secretariat&#13;
to the EC.&#13;
b.    Assigning clear roles and responsibilities for protection of the environment to the&#13;
concerned divisions/offices to facilitate effective implementation and full integration of&#13;
the environmental concerns into all stages of the project development cycle. This is to&#13;
ensure that the Environmental Process will be effectively implemented. During each&#13;
stage, the following scope of work will be considered:&#13;
During Preparation Phase:&#13;
*     project identification and planning --identify environmental issues, scope plans&#13;
for environmental study, conduct preliminary field survey, early consultation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

with the affected groups and concerned agencies;&#13;
*     feasibility study --prepare TOR, examine alternatives, assess impacts and&#13;
possible mitigation measures, estimate the budget required for implementation of&#13;
the mitigation measures, conduct economic analysis, prepare reports for the&#13;
environmental study (EIA, IEE, checklist) and obtain its approval as required by&#13;
laws/ regulations;&#13;
*     project budgeting --allocate adequate budget for implementation and monitoring&#13;
of the environmental mitigation measures; and&#13;
*     detailed design and bidding documents --incorporate the environmental&#13;
improvements and mitigation measures into the detailed design and the contract&#13;
specifications.&#13;
During Construction Phase:&#13;
*     monitoring and reporting to ensure compliance with the contract specification&#13;
on environmental protection aspect.&#13;
Operation and After Project Phase:&#13;
*     monitoring and evaluation to ensure adequacy of environmental protection and&#13;
cost effectiveness of the activities.&#13;
11.   Program 3. Acquire the Environment Technical Specialists (ETSs) ----[EC/EU]. National&#13;
and/or international ETSs will be acquired for at least 24 months. This is to assist DOH/EC/EU in&#13;
performing their tasks, especially in the areas of preparing EIA; integrating environmental concerns into&#13;
DOH procedures (including preparation of guidelines and manuals); development and implementation of&#13;
the strategy and workplan to deal with social impacts; and training. It is envisaged that during the initial&#13;
stage, long term ETSs (one principal specialist and one social specialist) will be acquired as soon as&#13;
possible. Short-term ETSs will be acquired periodically to provide services on specific issues, and their&#13;
TORs will be prepared by DOH with the assistance of the long-term ETSs. TOR for the long term ETSs&#13;
is shown in Schedule 2.&#13;
12.   Program 4. Develop and implement the standard practices/manuals to minimize the impacts&#13;
during construction and operation ---[Construction Division, Loan Control Division, EU]. This is to&#13;
facilitate effective implementation of the mitigation measures typical for road projects.  These&#13;
standards/manuals will be included in the specifications for construction or the contract documents and&#13;
will be carried out by DOH and/or the contractors. The activities will include the preparation of&#13;
documents, on-the-job training, and pilot studies. While the detailed workplan, including TORs, will be&#13;
prepared at a later stage with assistance from the ETSs, it is anticipated that the scope of work will cover&#13;
the following:&#13;
a.     Developing the standard practices/manuals, including monitoring and reporting formats,&#13;
for the mitigation actions to be carried out to minimize the impacts during transportation,&#13;
construction, and operation. The recommendations made in the SEA will be considered&#13;
in conjunction with the existing DOH practice. This activity will be carried out as part&#13;
of the TOR given in Schedule 3 (Task 1).&#13;
b.    Implementing the program, including the procurement of advanced technology and&#13;
training of staff.&#13;

13.   Program 5. Develop and use the guidelines/manuals for road planning and designs -&#13;
[Location and Design Division, Planning Division, EU]. This is to strengthen DOH's capacity to&#13;
minimize the negative impacts on the environment and the people through proper planning and design.&#13;
The activities will include the preparation of documents, acquisition of advanced technology, on-the-job&#13;
training, and pilot studies. Assistance of the long-term and short-term ETSs will be acquired during the&#13;
development and implementation of the activities. While the detailed workplan, including TORs, will&#13;
be prepared at a later stage with assistance from the long term ETSs, it is anticipated that the scope of&#13;
work will cover the following:&#13;
a.     Establishing a database to facilitate effective integration of environmental issues into the&#13;
planning stage, including monitoring and evaluation. At present, DOH is implementing&#13;
a program to develop a central database and computer system under an ADB loan. It is&#13;
anticipated that these concerns will be discussed with the study team to find a proper&#13;
ways to include them into the study. If necessary, a pilot program will be developed to&#13;
integrate the environmental information of the widening project, and software and&#13;
equipment will be acquired under the Fifth Highway Sector Project. ---[Planning div.,&#13;
EU]&#13;
b.     Preparing  the guidelines/manuals for planning, monitoring, and evaluation  as&#13;
recommnended in the SEA. The scope of work is included in the TOR shown in Schedule&#13;
3 (Task 2) ---[Planning Division, EU].&#13;
c.     Preparing specific guidelines/manuals for roadway design which are "appropriate" (which&#13;
meet the needs at acceptable levels and at an affordable cost), with particular attention&#13;
to ensuring adequate operation and maintenance for all categories of road development.&#13;
These manuals will be used by design engineers at central, regional, and local levels.&#13;
Due consideration will be given to minimize the need for land acquisition and to increase&#13;
the effectiveness of road safety, slope protection, drainage design, and noise/vibration&#13;
control. The TOR for the preparation is included in Schedule 3 (Task 3) ---[Location and&#13;
Design Division, EU]&#13;
d.     Carrying out on-the-job training abroad for design and planning staff (3 months courses,&#13;
3 persons/year, 3 years). For some specific area, advanced technology may be acquired&#13;
under the Fifth Highway Sector Project ---[Location and Design Division, EU].&#13;
14.   Program 6. Develop and implement a program to deal with social impacts to all affected&#13;
groups ---[DOH/EC/EU]. This is to ensure that none of the affected groups would be worse off because&#13;
of the project. A strategy to deal with the issues is shown in Schedule 4 and assistance of the long-term&#13;
and short-term ETSs to implement the strategy and prepare the workplans will be acquired.&#13;
15.   Program 7. Develop and carry out an environmental training program ---[DOH/EC/EU].&#13;
This is a long-term program to increase the knowledge and experience of DOH staff in both technical and&#13;
managerial aspects. International experience will be acquired periodically. The main activities will&#13;
include:  training of trainers; development of training courses and training materials (in Thai);&#13;
seminars/workshops; on-the-job training; and study tours. Priority will be given to provide training in&#13;
the areas of safety, erosion protection, air and noise reduction, flood protection, and cost/benefits&#13;
analysis. Implementation of case studies or pilot projects and close cooperation with MOSTE and other&#13;
key agencies will be encouraged. The training strategy and program is shown in Schedule 5.&#13;

E. OEPP Policy&#13;
19.   Past experience in EA review in Thailand suggested that the effectiveness of the EIA process is&#13;
hampered by the following factors:&#13;
a.     Limited knowledge and experience of concerned agencies on the environmental issues;&#13;
the EIA process; and the need to allocate adequate budget for implementation of the&#13;
mitigation measures.  Cooperation and coordination among these agencies are also&#13;
inadequate.&#13;
b.     Limited capacity of the project proponent to effectively deal with the environmental&#13;
issues. This includes inadequate consultation with the affected groups and the public, and&#13;
poor quality of the EIA study.&#13;
c.     Limited capacity of OEPP in implementing the review process and the lack of monitoring&#13;
and enforcement capacity.&#13;
20.   It is intended to strengthen the effectiveness of the EIA through the following strategies:&#13;
a.    Improve the knowledge and experience of concerned agencies on the environmental&#13;
issues; the EIA process; and the need to allocate adequate budget for the implementation&#13;
of the mitigation measures. The main activities would include training, meetings,&#13;
workshops, seminars, and establishment of a coordinating committee as appropriate.&#13;
b.    Improve the enviromnental capacity of the implementing agencies to carry out good&#13;

g.    Increase participation of the private sector, the public, and local communities,&#13;
especially in the area of monitoring and enforcement.  This is to deal with the&#13;
government policy to limit an increase in the number of the government officials.&#13;
21.   At present, OEPP is carrying out several studies (financed by CIDA, DANCBD and the ADB)&#13;
to improve the effectiveness of the EIA process, including development of general guidelines and manuals&#13;
for post monitoring and auditing of the ElAs. Despite these efforts, the effectiveness of the EIA cannot&#13;
be improved, since actual monitoring and enforcement activities are still lacking. To build OEPP's&#13;
capacity to carry out the monitoring and enforcement activities of the EIA process, especially for the&#13;
transportation projects, procurement of equipment, preparation of guidelines/manuals, and training are&#13;
the key requirements. OEPP is expected to acquire some EA monitoring equipment under the Action&#13;
Plan to reduce the vehicle emissions and noise pollution under the Fourth Highway Sector Project, and&#13;
a proposal was submitted to MOTC/APCU. The activities to be carried out under the Fifth Highway&#13;
Sector Project are outlined in the Section F.&#13;
F. OEPP Program Objective and Scope of Work&#13;
22.   The main objective of this program is to strengthen OEPP's capacity to carry out the EIA&#13;
process, including monitoring and enforcement, for the transportation sector with due consideration given&#13;
to the projects under the responsibility of DOH. The activities will be carried out by consultants under&#13;
supervision of OEPP from 1996-1999, and the terms of references and detailed workplan will be prepared&#13;
at a later stage. The main tasks/activities are described in the following paragraphs.&#13;

A. Background and Justification&#13;
1.    The Department of Highways (DOH) is the main agency responsible for building and operation&#13;
of the national, special, and concessional highways as specified by the Highway Act of 1992. As of&#13;
1993, about 54,195 km of the national highways and 193 km of the special highways were constructed.&#13;
About 4,345 km of inter-city motorways will be built during the next 20 years and 1,891 km of the main&#13;
national highways will be widened during the 7th Plan (1992-96). The total construction cost is about&#13;
400 million baht. The environmental issues, including land acquisition and resettlement, are the key&#13;
issues to be addressed during the planning and implementation of these development programs.&#13;
2.    During the preparation of the Fifth Highway Sector Project with financial assistance from the&#13;
World Bank, a Sector Environmental Assessment (SEA) was prepared. The SEA identifies the sector&#13;
environmental issues and mitigation measures to alleviate the negative impacts due to implementation of&#13;
the road and highway projects under the responsibility of DOH. An Environmental Process for DOH&#13;
and an Environmental Assessment Strengthening Program (EASP) were developed. Given the level of&#13;
environmental work to be carried out by DOH during the next five years and the limited environmental&#13;
capacity at present, the EASP identified the need to acquire technical assistance of national and/or&#13;
international specialists (Environmental Technical Specialists, ETSs) at least during the first two years.&#13;
3.    It is envisaged that long-term ETSs (one principal specialist and one social specialist) will be&#13;
acquired to assist DOH, the Environmental Committee (EC), and the Environmental Unit (EU) to prepare&#13;
the project ElAs and to implement the Environmental Process and EASP. Short-term ETSs may be&#13;
required periodically to provide services on specific issues, and their TORs will be prepared at a later&#13;
stage. This TOR is applied only to the long-term ETSs.&#13;
B. Scope of Work&#13;
4.    The Principal ETS. This is the key ETS responsible for providing assistance to DOH/EC/EU&#13;
in all environmental aspects, especially in the areas of preparing ElAs; integrating environmental concerns&#13;
into DOH's procedures (including preparation of guidelines and manuals); training; guiding the&#13;
development and implementation of activities to deal with social issues; and the implementation of the&#13;
Environmental Process and the EASP. The main activities will include, but not be limited to, the&#13;
following:&#13;
a.    Preparing detailed workplans and programs to implement the Environmental Process and&#13;
the EASP;&#13;
b.    Identifying the specific issues for technical assistance through short-term ETSs and&#13;
preparing the TORs;&#13;

the social and land acquisition issues, especially for the motorways project. According to the DOH policy&#13;
and strategy, public consultation and strengthening of DOH's capacity to facilitate effective&#13;
implementation of the land acquisition process are the first two priorities. The main activities include,&#13;
but are not limited to, the following:&#13;
a.     Studying laws, regulations, policy/guidelines, and in-country experiences to deal with&#13;
social issues and resettlement in Thailand and preparing detailed workplans and programs&#13;
to implement the DOH policy and a strategy to deal with these issues. Priority will be&#13;
given to the implementation of the Widening and Motorways Programs with due&#13;
consideration given to ensure compliance with the policy/guidelines established by the&#13;
key international financing institutions (the World Bank, ADB, OECF).&#13;

be addressed during the planning and implementation of these development programs.&#13;
2.    During the preparation of the Fifth Highway Sector Project with financial assistance from the&#13;
World Bank, a Sector Environmental Assessment (SEA) was prepared. The SEA identified the sector&#13;
environmental issues and mitigation measures to alleviate the negative impacts due to implementation of&#13;
the road and highway projects under the responsibility of DOH. As a consequence, a process to integrate&#13;
environmental concerns and a program to strengthen DOH's capacity to deal with the environmental&#13;
issues (called the Environmental Assessment Strengthening Program, EASP) were developed. This&#13;
activity is part of the implementation of the Programs 4 and 5 of EASP and the consultants are expected&#13;
to work closely with the key divisions/offices (Planning Division, EU, Construction Division, Loan&#13;
Control Division, Location and Design Division). It is anticipated that the guidelines/manuals (general&#13;
and/or specific) would be appropriate and meet the needs at acceptable levels and at an affordable cost&#13;
given due attention to ensuring adequate operation and maintenance.&#13;
B. Scope of Work&#13;

a.     General guidelines for planning and design, including monitoring, which are&#13;
appropriate for Thailand and DOH (in Thai and/or English). Existing guidelines related&#13;
to roads and the environment (the World Bank, ADB, etc.) should be studied. This&#13;
should include:&#13;
*      the guidelines to assist decision makers in the orientation of economic and&#13;
engineering-based policies so that they complement regulatory programs for&#13;
controlling environmental degradation within the highways sector.&#13;
*      the guidelines for national, regional, and local road master planning, with careful&#13;
attention to environmental concerns and integration with other development&#13;
activities. This includes criteria for ranking of projects during project screening.&#13;
*     the guidelines for monitoring programs, including all aspects of the community&#13;
environment. These programs should address quality-of-life, socio-economic,&#13;
institutional, and financing aspects. It should provide for periodic evaluation of&#13;
the monitoring data for use in planning needed improvement, and include&#13;
establishment of an appropriate central environmental database adequate for&#13;
assessing environmental quality in quantified terms suitable for use by&#13;
administrators, engineers, environmentalists, and economists.&#13;

to mninimnizing the need for land acquisition and to increase the effectiveness of noise/vibration control,&#13;
road safety, slope protection, and drainage design. For the last three cases (road safety, slope protection,&#13;
and drainage design), field surveys and/or pilot studies should be carried out to develop appropriate&#13;
criteria for the specific guidelines/manuals. A road safety master plan and program is being developed&#13;
and implemented under a separate action plan. During the planning and design stages, the following&#13;
reconmnendations should be considered:&#13;
a.     Water pollution from runoff. In the areas of high traffic volumes which are proximate&#13;
to drinking water reservoirs, areas of great biological value, and streams/rivers with&#13;
limited flows, the runoff should be directed away from sensitive water bodies through&#13;
roadways/shoulder design; use of catchment basins to allow for filtration of runoff; and&#13;
temporary impoundment and treatment at particular sensitive locations.&#13;

Schedule 3&#13;
b.     Interference with natural drainage patterns.  The following measures should be&#13;
considered -- drainage works to restore beneficial natural drainage patterns, to reduce&#13;
flooding in flood-prone areas and to impound water or encourage recharge in dry areas.&#13;
c.     Soil erosion.  The following measures should be considered -- limiting clear area;&#13;
mulching/planning and plant maintenance; slope design and stabilization; drainage works;&#13;
specification of work-site details (quarrying, off-road equipment traffic). The basic&#13;
design standards should be required in all areas and the specialized features should be&#13;
required in the areas of steep slopes, unstable soils or other erosion-prone areas.&#13;
d.     Historic/archaeological sites. For areas of cultural significance, the following measures&#13;
should be considered -- avoidance, preservation and information extraction; removal and&#13;
relocation of significant resources as last resort; and development of contractor&#13;
procedures.&#13;
e.     Impaired views, aesthetics. For scenic areas, national parks, and areas with tourists&#13;
potential, the following measures should be considered -- design to minimize alteration&#13;
of and maximize fit with existing environment.&#13;
f.     Induced development into ecologically sensitive areas. For sensitive natural areas and&#13;
national parks/preserves, the following measures should be considered --local or national&#13;
land use control.&#13;
g.     Relocation/resettlement. For roadway segments proximate to residential and business&#13;
developments, the following measures should be considered -- routing, bypass&#13;
construction; establishing and enforcing resettlement and compensation standards.&#13;
h.     Community life and economic activities. For community areas, the following should&#13;
be considered -- establishing and coordinating with local officials to arrange for local&#13;
circulation, business and housing needs.&#13;
7.     Task 4.  Considering the scope of work and the implementation of the guidelines/manuals&#13;
prepared above, consult with DOH and prepare and/or implement the following activities in detail,&#13;
including workplan and budget:&#13;
a.     Identify and carry out the pilot studies, at least one for each priority area, and prepare&#13;
strategy, including acquisition of advanced technology, to increase efficiency of the&#13;
design and construction.&#13;
b.     DOH overall training program for both in-country and abroad (see the strategy identified&#13;
in Schedule 5 Training Program) and prepare training materials to be used by DOH (in&#13;
Thai and/or English as appropriate).&#13;
8.     Task 5. Provide on-the-job training abroad for at least 10 technical staff in the specific areas.&#13;

THAILAND&#13;
FIFTH HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT&#13;
Land Acquisition, Resettlement, and Compensation Issues&#13;
A. Existing Practice and Previous Experience&#13;
1.    Land acquisition, resettlement, and compensation are often required for the construction of new&#13;
roads and highways when new alignments include intersections and the right-of-ways (ROW) are needed.&#13;
For widening projects, where the existing ROWs are inadequate, limited land acquisition, resettlement,&#13;
and compensation may be required. Due to the linear nature of road and highway projects, displacement&#13;
and land acquisition generally occur along the routes at different times. Thus, large scale resettlement&#13;
is not a normal DOH practice and usually can be avoided. Land acquisition procedures and the level of&#13;
compensation follow those provisions specified by the Land Expropriation Act (LEA) of 1987.&#13;
2.    Land acquisition procedure. DOH carries out the land acquisition process in three stages (see&#13;
Figures S4. 1 and S4.2). The process is initiated after completion of a preliminary survey and design for&#13;
new alignrent or expansion and clear ROW is defined. DOH first seeks a voluntary agreement for sale&#13;
with the land owners. DOH first establishes the highest price based on the guidelines and criteria&#13;
specified by the Civil and Commercial Law on buying and selling and the Land laws. This method is&#13;
commonly used for small scale land acquisition. If an agreement cannot be reached or if it is a large&#13;
scale land acquisition, DOH seeks issuance of a Royal Decree and the LEA is applied. By law, a&#13;
committee called the Valuation and Negotiation Conmmittee (VNC) is established to valuate the properties&#13;
and buildings and negotiate with the owners. The NVC is appointed by the Minister of Transport and&#13;
Communications (MOTC) and comprises one representative from DOH, Land Department, and Local&#13;
Government, and one representative from each of the local councils concerned. Compensation is paid&#13;
to the owners of the land, buildings, trees and crops; renters; and other damages such as the right to use&#13;
roads, drainages, electric lines, etc. Due to the limited validity of the Royal Decree (4 years), DOH&#13;
speeds up the process by seeking cabinet approval for issuance of a Ministerial Order for Urgent Notice&#13;
whereby DOH is authorized to use the property under the specified conditions after the appropriated&#13;
compensation is deposited. At the same time, DOH seeks issuance of a specific land acquisition law for&#13;
the project. The total time required for land acquisition through a Royal Decree is about 300-400 days.&#13;
3.    Criteria to valuate compensation. Land valuation is made according to the LEA, whose criteria&#13;
for valuation were revised a few times to provide fairness to both the affected groups and the general&#13;
public. Before 1987, three criteria were used by DOH to valuate the maximum value for negotiation:&#13;
tax assessment value, the property value for registration and collection of fees (property assessment value)&#13;
and the location of the land. The average value of these three criteria was used as the maximum value&#13;
for negotiation. During the period 1987 to 1990, according to the revised LEA, the higher value of these&#13;
three criteria was considered as the maximum value for land negotiation. In February 1991, the LEA&#13;
was again modified by a Notice of the National Peace Keeping Council No. 44 and five criteria were&#13;
established: (i) tax assessment value, (ii) property assessment value, (iii) location of the land, (iv) market&#13;
assessment value, and (v) the need and objective of land acquisition. These criteria are being used by&#13;
DOH for the land acquisition process at present. For buildings and other compensations, DOH estimates&#13;
the amount of compensation and submits it to the VNC for consideration and approval. The principle&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-83 -                                  Annex 3&#13;
Schedule 4&#13;
used in the estimation is that the owners will receive fair compensation and be able to move and rebuild&#13;
the same type of building.&#13;
4.     Notification, negotiation, and grievance. After the valuation process, the VNC issues public&#13;
notices on land values and other compensation and DOH notifies the owners individually. Negotiations&#13;
are carried out and if successful, payment is made within 120 days after the signing of an agreement or&#13;
120 days after the promulgation of the specific land compensation act. If negotiations are unsuccessful,&#13;
the owners can file their complaints with the Minister within 60 days. The Minister appoints a Complaint&#13;
Committee comprised experts of not less than five experts on law and valuation to consider the case and&#13;
make recommendations. If the Minister does not respond within 60 days or if the owners are not satisfied&#13;
with the Minister's decision, the owners can bring the case to court within one (1) year. DOH pays&#13;
compensation according to the court's orders.&#13;
5.    Issues. Despite the Government's and DOH's intention to minimize adverse impacts on the&#13;
affected groups, several key issues arise. First is the delay in payment, the major causes of which are&#13;
the limited budget allocation from the Government and DOH's limited capacity to facilitate effective&#13;
implementation of the process. This problem is being alleviated through improved coordination and&#13;
cooperation with the Budget Bureau and a significant increase in the budget allocation for land acquisition&#13;
during the past two years. More actions, however, are necessary to solve this issue.&#13;
6.     The second issue deals with the level of impacts and acceptance of the affected groups. This is&#13;
the most difficult and complicated issue. DOH is authorized to acquire land and provide compensation&#13;
according to those provisions specified by law. There are complaints for inadequate compensation and&#13;
unfair treatment, especially in the projects involving urban areas and/or indirect impacts. In the past,&#13;
DOH paid compensation to the owners of the land for indirect damage (such as soil erosion) and groups&#13;
of people who illegally occupied the public land. These cases, however, were considered on a case by&#13;
case basis and often required a long process due to the need to get direction and/or approval from the&#13;
Ministry of Finance and/or the cabinet. It is envisaged that to deal with this issue more effectively, close&#13;
consultation and a good database system at both the central and local levels is necessary. Through close&#13;
cooperation and coordination among the central and local offices, an inventory for the existing ROWs&#13;
will be carried out and updated periodically. The information will be integrated into the database system&#13;
for roads and highways that will be developed by DOH under technical assistance of ADB. Training of&#13;
all concerned staff is also necessary.&#13;
B. DOH Policy and Strategy&#13;
7.     The Government's and DOH's policy is to avoid and minimize resettlement, land acquisition, and&#13;
other negative impacts on the environment and the people. If resettlement and land acquisition is&#13;
unavoidable, fair compensation and treatment will be provided to all affected groups according to the&#13;
direction and guidelines provided by law or the cabinet. A system of grievance related to resettlement,&#13;
land acquisition, and compensation will be clearly established and made known to the public. It is DOH's&#13;
intention to do its best to assist the displaced people and ensure that their former living standards can be&#13;
restored or improved.&#13;
8.    Implementation of this policy, however, requires a long lead time and an adequate capacity on&#13;
the part of DOH. It is envisaged that, at the initial stage, the implementation strategies will focus on&#13;
developing means to facilitate effective integration of social issues into the early stages of project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-84 -                                   Annex 3&#13;
Schedule 4&#13;
preparation and effective implementation of the land acquisition process. The strategies/means include&#13;
the following:&#13;
a.     Increasing DOH's capacity, at both the central and local levels, to effectively plan and&#13;
implement the land acquisition process and protect the ROWs, including close&#13;
consultation with the local communities. The activities include, but are not limited to: -&#13;
--[Land Acquisition Division]&#13;
*      Establishing an effective database management system  for land acquisition,&#13;
especially in the area of mapping and data processing. It is expected that the&#13;
design of the system, including the specifications and bidding documents, will be&#13;
carried out as part of the central database development (ADB project), while&#13;
procurement of the equipment will be carried out under the Fifth Highway Sector&#13;
Project. Training of staff is expected to be part of this procurement.&#13;
*      Carrying out an inventory program for existing ROWs and defining programs&#13;
and/or activities (including responsible divisions/offices) to update the status of&#13;
the ROWs and to facilitate close consultation with the affected groups, the local&#13;
communities, and the local agencies. This will include programs to disseminate&#13;
information and to conduct an independent study for monitoring/evaluation as&#13;
appropriate.&#13;
*      Coordinating with concerned divisions (Planning Division, Location and Design&#13;
Division, EU) and/or agencies to seek ways and means to speed up the land&#13;
acquisition process and payment.&#13;
b.     When the new ROWs are required, attempts will be made to first avoid and/or minimize&#13;
the need for displacement and land acquisition during the planning stage. Unlike the&#13;
reservoir projects which are carried out by the Electricity Generation Authority of&#13;
Thailand (EGAT) and the Royal Irrigation Department (RID), large scale displacement&#13;
can be avoided by rerouting, modifying alignment, and building bypasses. Feasible&#13;
options and public consultation may be carried out as appropriate --[Planning Division,&#13;
Location and Design Division, EU].&#13;
c.     If displacement is inevitable, the degree of impacts will be studied in more detail during&#13;
the feasibility study and mitigation measures prepared. For small scale displacement&#13;
and/or other social impacts, DOH will consider all feasible options to provide adequate&#13;
compensation and/or assistance (such as restore or replace any access taken) to the&#13;
affected groups as specified by laws and/or the cabinet.  Close consultation and&#13;
coordination with the public, the local community, the affected groups and other&#13;
concerned agencies will be carried out ---[Planning Division, EU].&#13;
d.     For large scale impacts, where displacement of more than 200 people is involved, the&#13;
feasibility study will include the preparation of a specific strategy with time bound action&#13;
plan, comprising: baseline data; options and budget for displacement, compensation, and&#13;
restoration of the living conditions; and monitoring and evaluation the effectiveness of&#13;
the program. For those illegal inhabitants, especially the minority and the disadvantaged&#13;
groups, the plan will identify measures to be taken to ensure that they will not be worst&#13;
off because of the project. Due consideration will be given to the necessity, income&#13;
&#13;

levels, occupation, duration of inhabitation, and the necessity for making a living.&#13;
Measures will also be taken to ensure adequate budget and capacity of the agencies&#13;
responsible for carrying out the plan ---[Planning Division, EU].&#13;
e.     Develop mechanisms/means to facilitate effective consultation with the local communities&#13;
and other agencies to minimize the social impacts during the planning stage. The&#13;
activities include, but are not limited to, --[Planning Division, EU]:&#13;
*      initiating close relationships with the key agencies responsible for welfare and&#13;
well being of the affected groups, especially the minority and the disadvantaged&#13;
groups (the provinces, local governments, social and welfare department, national&#13;
housing authority, labor ministry, etc.).&#13;
*      developing and implementing a process, standard procedure, and/or manual of&#13;
practice to facilitate effective consultation and/or participation of the affected&#13;
groups, the local communities, and the public during the implementation of DOH&#13;
projects.&#13;
C. Workplan and Schedule&#13;
9.     A consulting firm will be acquired to assist in the implementation of the program. Terms of&#13;
Reference will be prepared during the first four months of project implementation, and the TA would be&#13;
carried out to project completion.&#13;

FIFTH HIGHWAY SECTOR PROJECT&#13;
Strate2v and Pro2ram for DOH Environmental Training&#13;
A. Training Strategy&#13;
1.    The main objective of DOH's training program is to increase awareness, knowledge, and&#13;
experience of DOH staff at all levels so that the environmental issues are considered at all stages of road&#13;
development projects and mitigation measures are effectively taken. At present it is recognized that the&#13;
DOH training center carries out a training program to provide technical knowledge and experience to&#13;
DOH staff as well as officials from other neighboring countries. The MOSTE training center, named&#13;
the Environmental Research and Training Center (ERTC), which is operated under the responsibility of&#13;
the Environmental Quality Promotion Department (EQPD), carries out general environmental courses,&#13;
including EIA and air pollution control. These two training centers will play a major role in the&#13;
implementation of the DOH training program, and close coordination and cooperation among them will&#13;
be established as soon as possible.&#13;
2.    The training strategy to create a long-term  training capacity at DOH  to deal with the&#13;
environmental issues are:&#13;
a.    to integrate an environmental training program into DOH's existing training program&#13;
through development of a core group of environmental trainers and preparation of&#13;
training courses and training materials (in Thai).&#13;
b.    to establish a close relationship and training program with ERTC on specific subjects:&#13;
(i) measurement and management of air/noise/vibration impacts of highways projects; (ii)&#13;
measurement of water pollution; (iii) ecology and biodiversity; and (iv) general EIA&#13;
procedure and methodology.&#13;
c.    to establish a close relationship with the appropriate road organizations in developed&#13;
countries for exchange of knowledge and experiences through on-the-job training and&#13;
research, and development of the subjects related to environmental impacts of road, road&#13;
safety, and environmental cost/benefits for road projects. These organizations include:&#13;
the United States Federal Highway Administration, the United Kingdom Overseas&#13;
Development Administration, the Transport Research Laboratory Overseas Center, the&#13;
Sweden National Roads Administration, the Australia Roads Corporation, etc.&#13;
3.    The training activities will focus on in-country training and training of trainers. On-the-job&#13;
training in some specific areas and study tours for high-level decision makers are also necessary and will&#13;
be carried out periodically. A limited number of degree or diploma training in-country and/or abroad&#13;
will be carried out as appropriate. Scope of the training will consist of the following key elements over&#13;
a period of three (or five) years:&#13;

a.     Basic Training: The purpose of this training is to:&#13;
*      Provide general knowledge and understanding of the broader environmental&#13;
issues facing DOH in its development and management of road and highway&#13;
activities.&#13;
*      Increase awareness and knowledge of DOH's staff on available technology and&#13;
environmental management for road projects and the future trends (at the&#13;
international, national, and local 'evels) for the environmental protection policies,&#13;
legislation, directives, enforcement, penalties, etc.&#13;
The training participants will include staff of DOH and other key agencies, including the&#13;
Budget Bureau, the Ministry of Finance, and the Office of Civil Service Conunittee.&#13;
b.     Specific technical training: This training is aimed at increasing the technical knowledge&#13;
and experience of DOH's staff at both the central and local levels. Priority for training&#13;
will be given to the EU staff; the engineers, technicians, and other officials responsible&#13;
for planning, surveying and design, construction, operation and maintenance of&#13;
road/highways projects; and the staff responsible for land acquisition, research and&#13;
development, and training. Implementation of case studies and exchanges of actual&#13;
experience of local and international specialists will be encouraged, and inputs of the&#13;
short-term ETSs may be required as appropriate. The training areas will include:&#13;
*      knowledge about control technology for air, noise, vibration, and water quality&#13;
impacts of road projects;&#13;
*      knowledge about EIA study/methodology and after-project evaluation for road&#13;
projects;&#13;
*      database management for road projects;&#13;
*      environmental cost/benefits of highway projects methodology -- 3-6 months&#13;
training abroad;&#13;
*      site supervision training -- to provide in-depth methodological, technical, and&#13;
practical knowledge covering all activities of supervising the construction work&#13;
and maintenance; case studies and site visits both in-country and abroad will be&#13;
encouraged.&#13;
c.     Long term training -- 1-2 studies for master degree or diploma (2-3 years) will be&#13;
identified with assistance from the ETSs.&#13;

B. Training Program (to be finalized under TA financed by ADB)&#13;
4.     With assistance from the ETSs, the workplan and schedule for the training program (in-country&#13;
and abroad) will be established and carried out. The training programs will include the following:&#13;
Program 1: Specific training with ERTC. DOH will work closely with ERTC/EQPD in&#13;
developing and implementing a training program on the environmental issues related to&#13;
road/highway projects. Special attention will be given to provide training on (i) the preparation&#13;
of EIA, IEE, and checklists; (ii) air, noise, vibration, and water pollution control, including&#13;
measurement methods; (iii) land and marine ecology and biodiversity; and (iv) social aspects.&#13;
It is anticipated that during 1996, the specific training program (for 20-25 persons/course),&#13;
including training materials, for DOH's staff will be developed and the training will be carried&#13;
out the following years. Beginning in 1997, limited DOH staff will participate in the training&#13;
courses which are already provided by the ERTC.&#13;
Program 2: Build DOH training capacity. DOH will identify 15-20 trainers from the EU and&#13;
staff from the key divisions and offices responsible for project planning and implementation,&#13;
including training and research and development. These trainers will have priority to participate&#13;
in all training courses, including on-the-job training, and will be responsible for assisting in the&#13;
preparation and implementation of the DOH environmental training courses and training&#13;
materials. Qualified trainers will be selected for long-term training (degree or diploma) in-&#13;
country or abroad, as appropriate.&#13;
Program 3: Management training. The activities will include meetings, seminars, workshops,&#13;
conferences, and study tours as appropriate. During 1996-99, the following activities will be&#13;
carried out:&#13;
a.     Convene seminars/conferences on "roads/highways and the environment" -- this is to&#13;
acquire and exchange international knowledge and experience of the environmental issues&#13;
and to establish relationships and cooperation with road agencies or institutions in&#13;
developed countries, especially in the area of on-the-job training.&#13;
b.     Convene in-house seminars/workshops on road/highway projects and the environment.&#13;
This is to provide basic knowledge of the environmental issues and road/highway projects&#13;
in Thailand, including laws and regulations related to the EIA, IEE, and checklists.&#13;
Representatives from other key agencies will be invited as appropriate.&#13;
C.     Convene two study tours for senior staff of DOH and other key agencies responsible for&#13;
the planning and implementation of the environmental works for road and highway&#13;
projects.&#13;

Bank Supervision Input&#13;
1.     The staff input indicated in the table below refers to field missions only and is in addition to regular&#13;
supervision needs at headquarters for review of progress and audit reports and consultants' reports on technical&#13;
assistance and studies, procurement actions, correspondence, etc., which is estimated at four staff weeks in FY1995&#13;
and five staff weeks each for fiscal years 1996-2000. The Bank's supervision input is estimated to total 96 staff-&#13;
weeks, of which 29 would be at headquarters and 67 in the field. This input is higher than the average but is&#13;
dictated by the complex action plans for reduction of pollution from vehicle emissions and improved traffic safety&#13;
which req,uire considerable input from specialists.&#13;

            Thailand - Fifth Highway Sector Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            With the general objective of meeting
            the continued rapid growth in transport demand resulting
            from sustained economic growth, and to address critical
            issues associated with the transport-related environmental
            pollution and traffic safety, the Fifth Highway Sector
            Project aims specifically at: 1) furthering the
            implementation of actions aimed at reducing environmental
            degradation and vehicular accidents attributable to fast
            growing motorization through the establishment of a
            privately operated vehicle inspection system; 2) improving
            the quality of service of the inter-urban road network
            through increased road capacity and improved safety
            standards of existing roads; and 3) providing a systematic
            basis for the establishment of environmental assessment
            criteria at the design stage as well as environmental
            management during and after new road construction and
            capacity increases. The project will finance the following
            components over a period of about four years: 1) civil works
            sub-projects for capacity increases involving the widening
            to four lanes and rehabilitation of the existing two lanes
            of selected sections of the country's major inter-urban
            national highways; 2) consulting services for the design and
            supervision of the Department of Highways' (DOH) road
            widening program; 3) technical assistance and training to
            the Land Transport Department, the Department of Pollution
            Control, DOH and the Ministry of Transport and
            Communications related to air quality, highway safety
            improvements, and institutional development; and 4)
            strengthening environmental assessment and mitigation
            management capacities at DOH and the Office of Environmental
            Policy and Planning.
