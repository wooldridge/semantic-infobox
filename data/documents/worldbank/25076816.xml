&#13;
The following is a transcript of an oral interview conducted by the authors of the World&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s fiftieth anniversary history: John P. Lewis, Richard Webb and Devesh Kapur,&#13;
The World Bank: Its First Half Century, Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press,&#13;
1997. It is not a formal oral history, and it is not a systematic overview of the work of the&#13;
person interviewed. At times the authors discussed the planned publication itself and the&#13;
sources that should be consulted; at other times they talked about persons and&#13;
publications extraneous to the Bank. Some interview tapes and transcripts begin and end&#13;
abruptly. Nevertheless, the World Bank Group Archives believes that this transcript may&#13;
be of interest to researchers and makes it available for public use.&#13;

&#13;
[Tape 1, Side A]1&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The Bank, if you look at it in Washington or from other perspectives, has&#13;
seemed to turn some fairly sharp corners. [Robert S.] McNamara came aboard, after all,&#13;
at about the time that people were discovering that trickle-down didn't work, they said,&#13;
and then he had to push very hard for kind of populist programs, poverty alleviation and&#13;
so on. That was his trademark. That was just when the Bank was getting started here, and&#13;
as far as we can tell was on a rather different track in a way, as you were interested in&#13;
macro stability and responsible financing. And then, of course, at the end of the â&#128;&#152;70s&#13;
there was this sharp turn in the Bank toward adjustment, really toward policy-based&#13;
lending. As we hear the story here, thereâ&#128;&#153;s been a policy dialogue going on all the way&#13;
through. But what have you seen about the--have there been changes in the Bank's&#13;
message, main message, about development?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Well, I--maybe you have seen my curriculum vitae, you know, I don't know. I&#13;
started in this office as Bureau Chief, Agriculture and Irrigation. I was the first one of&#13;
three of us of the new Indonesian regime to negotiate a loan from IDA [International&#13;
Development Association] at that time.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: It was 1968, a small loan, five million dollars.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: That was the very first Bank loan, wasn't it?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, we've heard about that.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: [inaudible] That was just because the IGGI [Inter-Governmental Group for&#13;
Indonesia] was just formed and members and so on, and then suddenly we found that&#13;
there is an opening, and we have come up to identify [inaudible] We have beenâ&#128;&#148;I donâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
knowâ&#128;&#148;we have been alwaysâ&#128;&#148;I am an agricultural economist by background.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, good.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: And so I was very happy in the Bureau when the government decided to, really&#13;
to start emphasizing, giving priority to agricultural development because according to me&#13;
that's the best strategy because the poorest of the people were there and so on.&#13;
&#13;
So when we approached the Bank, we started with them, â&#128;&#156;Look, we would like you to&#13;
participate in this type of strategy.â&#128;&#157; That was â&#128;&#152;68. I don't know whether McNamara was&#13;
there or not.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, heâ&#128;&#153;d just come.&#13;

                                 November 26, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: That was my [inaudible] and because of that they agreed, and especially in&#13;
rehabilitating thousands, hundreds of thousands of hectares of irrigation works, technical&#13;
irrigation, which was neglected in the â&#128;&#152;50s and â&#128;&#152;60s, not maintained. Saltation was high,&#13;
inefficient and so on. So we started with that big.&#13;
&#13;
Since that time I went as bureau chief two, three times a year to negotiate this type of&#13;
thing, irrigation systems, agriculture, intensification programs, and so on and so on. So in&#13;
that sense it coincides, if what you said about McNamara, more appropriate and so on.&#13;
When we came in, when we start our first five-year plan, the emphasis on agriculture and&#13;
rural development, and once we graduated from IDA we start more to the harder things&#13;
like electricity, roads. It was basically infrastructure and human resources development&#13;
activity.&#13;
&#13;
Some in the early years alsoâ&#128;&#148;â&#128;&#152;60s and â&#128;&#152;70s, late â&#128;&#152;60s and early â&#128;&#152;70s--goes to the&#13;
fertilizer plants. That is, as a result we builtâ&#128;&#148;we have one of the biggest complexes of&#13;
fertilizer plants. It is not in one loan. The first loan is about 350,000 pounds and then&#13;
500,000 pounds, 510, because it coincides also with agriculture. We need the fertilizer.&#13;
As you know, the technology was now known, what you called then the â&#128;&#156;green&#13;
revolution.â&#128;&#157; The variety is there. We need urea and so on. And we have gas, and we&#13;
have--we received a loan from the Bank in order to build.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Wasn't some in the Bank skeptical about the fertilizer plants?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Once, yes, because they don't believe in the beginning. Not too many people&#13;
believed it actually at that time, that we will, that the farmers will absorb the new&#13;
technology that fast, you see, because they never used chemical fertilizer before, before&#13;
the â&#128;&#152;60s and â&#128;&#152;70s. They used this normal fertilizer, you know, a very small amount&#13;
anyway of chemical. We have a small urea plant, but it's not much here. Then we&#13;
introduced this new technology, and people are skeptical, but we have a price policy, you&#13;
see, in which we have the ceiling and floor price policy of rice in which we protect the&#13;
farmers during the harvest season from a too low price and the consumers during the pre-&#13;
harvest season. In between the market is free. So with that so-called . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You enforce this by a government marketing operation, then.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Yes. But, you know, procurement during the harvest and selling it during the&#13;
pre-harvest. We do the storage. But in between those prices the private sector is free to&#13;
move because we want to protect the consumers and also the--because, you know, there&#13;
is always a downswing very heavily in the harvest season.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, yes. And this reduction of risk you think . .&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Exactly, and we give them an incremental benefit/cost ratio quite substantial in&#13;
the beginning with the purpose to attract the farmers for using the new technology but&#13;
also increasing their income. And that works, this worked. And so the absorption of--the&#13;
demand for fertilizer jumped quite rapidly in the beginning. In the beginning the World&#13;
&#13;
                                    Saleh Afiff&#13;
                            November 26, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Bank is skeptical whether--it is a good approach but whether you can move that fast. But&#13;
after a couple of years we can see from the import figures of fertilizers that we are using&#13;
quite substantial fertilizer, and we have the gas, the resources.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Was the Bank skeptical about the use of fertilizer per se or about the imports&#13;
of fertilizer versus manufacture?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: No, they are skeptical about the absorption of the farmers of the new technology&#13;
which requires using fertilizer.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, you could--you had the option of import or make it, and there was a lot&#13;
of . .&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: But not easy--millions of tons of--you know, we have to import it from Poland,&#13;
we have to--and then it has to be in time in the [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: But I know what you mean. I was in the fertilizer business in India, and I kept&#13;
arguing the same way, but there was a lot of supply on the market. They were flaring&#13;
natural gas in the Gulf and so on, and some people thought that you ought to make your&#13;
ammonia there and that would be very cheap. But Iâ&#128;&#153;m glad . .&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Well, natural gas, maybe there is a lot, but the fertilizer marketâ&#128;&#148;I experienced&#13;
it because it's notâ&#128;&#148;itâ&#128;&#153;s not stable.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That's right, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. For security reasons really almost you would have a&#13;
good case for having--in a market this sizeâ&#128;&#148;to produce your own.&#13;
&#13;
So they were really into agriculture right alongside you?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: In the beginning, yes, yeah. And infrastructure and then human resources&#13;
development and education.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: We'd like to continue this business of sectors, but weâ&#128;&#153;ve heard some things just&#13;
today at lunch from Dick [Richard H.] Patten, actually, about this, your INPRES&#13;
[Instruksi Presiden, Presidential Instruction] program, and that . .&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: He can tell you stories, then, huh!&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, right!&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Would you like some coffee, please? Or tea?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: A cup of coffee would be nice.&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption; pause for coffee]&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Saleh Afiff&#13;
                           November 26, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Weâ&#128;&#153;d love to hear your sort of summary of that and particularly interested in--&#13;
apparently the World Bank, a lot of people in the Bank were in favor of trying to&#13;
contribute to that, but other people were resistant and they never did it, that you had to go&#13;
it alone. Is that right?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Right, right. I mean, when we started the INPRES program the World Bank--it&#13;
depends on which people you talk to in the Bank, you know; it's a big organizationâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
theyâ&#128;&#153;re very skeptical because we're granting the provinces and districts funding, you&#13;
know, okay? This is more of a grant, you know, this, to develop the regions, because you&#13;
know the stage of development in the regions is led by the biggest, is way above Irian&#13;
Jaya, Java and so on. This is a huge country, as you are aware, and so we try to improve&#13;
the situation with reducing the discrepancies between the regions and granting them so&#13;
that they could develop their own projects and so on, but of course in the beginning with&#13;
guidelines from central government--and that is minister of internal affairs, you know--&#13;
what use, of course, for infrastructure, not for housing for the governor or something like&#13;
that, you know, not consumptive but more really for . . .&#13;
&#13;
And we have also an elementary school program in which we develop elementary&#13;
schools. In the last, during the INPRES program from â&#128;&#152;74 to now, maybe we have built&#13;
about 60,000 more . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: 60,000.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: . . elementary schools. And weâ&#128;&#153;re continuing to build more in the remote areas.&#13;
I think the participatory rate of school-age children at a time--in the beginning noises are&#13;
[inaudible] will be just 20, 30 percent loss of the total allocated to the regions because&#13;
the system is not established yet. All right. At that time we have, as you know, in '74, oil&#13;
money and oil went up, you know, and okay, if we don't start it now and if we wait for a&#13;
perfect procedure and system, with a country with at that time still poor communication&#13;
then you might have lost the opportunity, so we decided to--to do it anyway. And after a&#13;
couple of years they become, they change their minds--I mean the Bank--and some&#13;
suggestion to participate. But you know the Bank! I mean, I know you know the Bank.&#13;
We are worried that they will change the procedures and so on and so on according the&#13;
theologies they have in the procurement system and so on and so on, you know. So I say,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Well, we are happy with our system as it is. Donâ&#128;&#153;t . . .â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Do you remember who in the Bank resisted it?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: No, I don't recall really, but it certainly was not Bernie [Bernard R.] Bell.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: No, I understand that. Patten said that Bell was for it, and then his successor&#13;
[David L.] Gordon was for it.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: I thought that Gordon who is . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Do you think he resisted, Gordon resisted?&#13;
&#13;
                                    Saleh Afiff&#13;
                            November 26, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: I really--I don't know.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And there was the rural development crowd in the Bank like, headed by Monty&#13;
[Montague] Yudelman. He was for it, I understand. There were some other projects&#13;
people who were questioning it.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Look. In the beginning, as I said, they are criticizing us that â&#128;&#156;you are wasting&#13;
your money.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Too decentralized, too loose.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Yeah, because the system is not good yet. Okay, that is the beginning. We&#13;
started, as I said. But then when it starts to show some successes, significant successes or&#13;
whatever is going on, they would like to participate.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: They wanted to come in then, yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: They want to go in there and give usâ&#128;&#148;but, of course, with conditions and so on.&#13;
And at that time--you have met Professor Widjojo [Nitisastro] , perhaps; he was the&#13;
chairman . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, yes.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: . . he said--we discussed it among ourselves, and said, â&#128;&#156;Well, they might--this is&#13;
the regions, you know. Regions are far away from central--and they might change&#13;
procedures, you know. They might suggest changes and any, which might not be suitable&#13;
for the regions, far-away regions, and so on.â&#128;&#157; And at that time we still had the money, at&#13;
that time the oil money, you see, â&#128;&#152;78 it becomes higher again. So we say, â&#128;&#156;Why don't you&#13;
concentrate as to the World Bank on others, infrastructure and so on?â&#128;&#157; That's what we&#13;
did. Who is against it? So I [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The idea for all of that--the design, so to speak, of that INPRES program--that&#13;
was pretty much Indonesian?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Indonesian, but Dick Patten and another Dutch expert who is in here assist us.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see, I see. I guess Patten had come from East Pakistan. Heâ&#128;&#153;d done something&#13;
like that in Pakistan.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Just to get an idea, Patten said that he thought this INPRES budget amounted to&#13;
something like 15 percent of the total budget every year. Is it that much?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Yeah, just a moment. It depends, you know, with what do you compare.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
                                    Saleh Afiff&#13;
                            November 26, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                     7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: If you look, the INPRES program is totally rupiah program. Now, if you look at&#13;
our budget, it consists of two parts: thereâ&#128;&#153;s the rupiah expenditures, development&#13;
expenditures, and foreign aid [inaudible] . Now, this year, for example, we have about&#13;
four billionâ&#128;&#148;four trillion out of eleven rupiah. [He has apparently moved away to get&#13;
documentation.] Four of the eleven, about that much.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Four out of . .&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Out of eleven.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Four billion out of eleven?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Trillion, trillion rupiah.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Four billion is the INPRES?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Out of eleven trillion?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Four trillion out of eleven, almost 35 percent, something like that.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Eleven is the total rupiah?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: That is rupiah expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Development funds.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: So this is about 35 percent of the rupiah . .&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: My goodness!&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: So our [inaudible] of government [inaudible] is [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I'm sorry. What is the savings rate in Indonesia?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Total government savings or what?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Both public and private combined.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Why, I really--I have the figures for that but I forget about it.&#13;
&#13;
                                   Saleh Afiff&#13;
                           November 26, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
We give priority to that program because it is, first, employment creation. It is rural,&#13;
basically, also, because we give villages allocations. Each village receives an allocation,&#13;
women's groups in the villages who perform social functions, they can help family&#13;
planning and so on.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It has a self-help element too, doesn't it? Matching grants?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Yeah, matching grants and some things like that. So we give, for example, a&#13;
village three million rupiah. The village head and community there should develop a&#13;
project which can, might cost them a million rupiah, and we give part from this, central&#13;
government.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: That is what really developed the rural, I would say, the INPRES program, in&#13;
addition to the agricultural development through . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: What--do you have any offhand notion of what percent of GDP this is? It's&#13;
prettyâ&#128;&#148;itâ&#128;&#153;s nontrivial, isn't it?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: GDP? That's put at 100 billion dollars now. 100 billion dollarsâ&#128;&#148;is it? I start&#13;
thinking ofâ&#128;&#148;yeah, if it is four trillion, it is 2 billion dollars.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: 2 billion? So it's two percent? That's a pretty big fraction. Huge. [all speaking&#13;
at once]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That's reallyâ&#128;&#148;thatâ&#128;&#153;s a serious commitment. That is very impressive. And&#13;
where does that commitment come from? I mean, I know there are a lot of different&#13;
people are involved, but obviously it must reflect the priorities of your president to some&#13;
considerable extent and . . .&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: [inaudible, speaking to someone else in the room]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Clearly, these are the kind of allocations that you've proposed from this office,&#13;
and the economic group as a whole, I suppose, shares this, but in a system where you had&#13;
a very active set of public and parliamentary forces, a more overtly democratic system,&#13;
you expect that there had to be a political explanation for such a big allocation. Where is&#13;
the motivation for this?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Well, as I said, we are committed to a--from beginning, actually, poverty&#13;
alleviation, because in our philosophy of development is, what is the goal? We have triple&#13;
objectives, we call it, which is growth, equity, and stability. And this--for poverty&#13;
alleviation you need to grow, but there are certain pockets which do not benefit fully&#13;
&#13;

                            November 26, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
from the growth. We give special programs for them. That is, the objective is growth,&#13;
equity, and stability. So we try to balance between, so in our objectives a sufficient&#13;
growth rate--not high growth rate--we call it . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Sufficient growth rate.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: . . so that we can share all the allocations we have. But we have the last two&#13;
years quite higher than normal. [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Higher than sufficient?&#13;
&#13;
AFFIF: It is above seven percent, and all problems created there, infrastructure and so&#13;
on, overheated economy, and everything is there.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: We see in the newspapers thereâ&#128;&#153;s quite a lot of debate now whether next year is&#13;
going to be more . . .&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Yeah, tight money policy or not. We are tightening now the money policy, the&#13;
money supply, and balance of payments problems and so on. But that is the philosophy.&#13;
&#13;
But in parliament we have two stages of discussion before this, before we submit the&#13;
budget and after we submit the budget.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: And almost we hear voices that the INPRES program should be increased&#13;
through the allocation and so on. And, of course, 80 percent of the regions also&#13;
[inaudible] They have problems to our [inaudible] also. Even in the lean years of the&#13;
Repelita IV, 1984-88, when we have a sharp decline of oil prices, you know, â&#128;&#152;85, â&#128;&#152;86, we&#13;
maintained the INPRES allocations out of subsidy, the sectoral allocations subsidies. We&#13;
maintained the INPRES allocations.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Thereâ&#128;&#153;s one sort of feature of Indonesia that is very different from most other&#13;
LDCs [less developed countries] , and it's the very different spatial dimension. Itâ&#128;&#153;s very&#13;
unique, in fact, you know, the sheer number of islands and the vast geographical expanse.&#13;
Iâ&#128;&#153;d be curious if you could tell us if the Bank has been sensitive to this difference, or this&#13;
unique aspect of Indonesia, whether it is in the transportation development sector,&#13;
whether it is in sort of implicit or explicit subsidies for the more disadvantaged regions,&#13;
so on and so forth? Has that beenâ&#128;&#148;I mean, I'm sure it occupies your mind a great deal,&#13;
but do you think it captures their attention?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: I would say, yes, especially the last years, I mean the more recent years. Well,&#13;
let's put it this way: in the earlier years in agriculture when we decided to rehabilitate our&#13;
irrigation system to be more efficient and so on, we looked also in other sectors of&#13;
agriculture, that is, the estates, crops, you know, the plantation system, cash crops like&#13;
palm oil, rubber and so on. These are located mostly outside Java in Sumatra, but&#13;
&#13;
                                    Saleh Afiff&#13;
                            November 26, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Sumatra is consistingâ&#128;&#148;are existing plantations which we took over from the Dutch&#13;
become state enterprises . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: . . that we took over in â&#128;&#152;57, â&#128;&#152;58 and becomes . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And you've still got â&#128;&#152;em!&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: . . weâ&#128;&#153;ve still got them and we got stuck with them, and it is very inefficient and&#13;
so on. But then they startâ&#128;&#148;and the Bank help us with four or five big estates in North&#13;
Sumatra and so on.&#13;
&#13;
Then we noticed that other country, other areas, other islands like Kalimantan, who never&#13;
knew a plantation system, or in Sulawesi or even now in Irian Jaya, we can develop the&#13;
same plantation system, but what we call the nucleus estate, you know. There is a nucleus&#13;
estate of 4,000 hectares and surrounding it is by the smallholders. And this is really a&#13;
very successful approach. This is the Bank's idea, for the nucleus estate.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It is the Bank's idea. All right.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Nucleus estate, and then surrounding an estate, consisting of state enterprise,&#13;
yeah, 4,000 hectares, for providing the processing facilities andâ&#128;&#148;how do you call it--&#13;
extension services to the small farmers around it.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Isn't the Bank trying to get you to privatize the nucleus now?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Yeah, they try, they tried to do it, but itâ&#128;&#153;s notâ&#128;&#148;but the private sector is full of&#13;
this pattern. They are doing it now.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see. I guess this is a country that has done more of that than any other, but&#13;
that sort of pattern has sometimes worked with the large private grower.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Yeah, but first it was state, it was only state enterprise, and thereâ&#128;&#153;s not too many&#13;
estate private enterprise at that time.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That idea from the Bank was somebody in agriculture department . .&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: . . or somebody here?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: No, from the Bank. We talk about it, you know. First, actually, it is more--and&#13;
they are very much involved in transmigration, as you know, in those years, and&#13;
transmigration is actually rice and cash crops, food and cash crops, and the cash crops.&#13;
And then when it becomes more difficult, why not developing this nucleus estate because&#13;
&#13;
                                    Saleh Afiff&#13;
                            November 26, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
it is still the same people, people who are now trained as rubber planters?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: This is a way to sort of create an environment for the transmigrants when they&#13;
come in and do these small things and they get the guidance from you and--I see.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Now we areâ&#128;&#148;in Irian Jaya we have cacao, palm oil in Sulawesi. It doesnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
exist anymore. In that sense, I would say, yes, but they are also interested in sea&#13;
communications, you know, small harbors and so on. I don't think that we have--they&#13;
financed two big harbors here in Java, but also I don't remember exactly what harbors.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But it seems--the Bank's own reviews on the transmigration sort of give it&#13;
mixed reviews. Would that be your sense also or . . .&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Well, I know the grid system in many countries was [inaudible] Even in the&#13;
IGGI it was mentioned as, â&#128;&#156;Oh, this colonization of Sumatra and Kalimantan by the&#13;
Javanese,â&#128;&#157; you know, because we transmigrate the Javanese, the Balinese, also the South&#13;
Sulawesi people--the areas with high density population to more . . .&#13;
&#13;
I think if you want to develop an area and there is no people in it--we did this in Irian&#13;
Jaya, for example; there is less than one per square kilometer, I think, and that is very&#13;
low--you cannot develop them without people. There are no markets [inaudible] and we&#13;
have to--and the regions are screaming. They will ask for it. Every time I go to Aceh, to&#13;
Irian Jaya, to Sulawesi, they ask, â&#128;&#156;We need transmigrants.â&#128;&#157; But they are expensive. Yeah,&#13;
they are expensive because we have to clear the land, build houses for them, and free the&#13;
land from forest.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: There is that--you said â&#128;&#156;clear the land.â&#128;&#157; There is an environmental question.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Yes, yes, of course, there is an environmental question also, cutting forests and&#13;
so on. We are concerned about environmental impact also, so we made quite a lot of&#13;
studies before we start on transmigration. Of course, the environmental impact is now&#13;
moreâ&#128;&#148;what do you call it--questionable perhaps in the international world because&#13;
everybody talk now about environment. We did already from ten years ago, is it, or&#13;
fifteen, I donâ&#128;&#153;t know, when Emil Salim was, when we have a minister of environment.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, you had? Fifteen years?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. â&#128;&#153;78.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Since 1978, 1980. [all speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s the chap we talked with?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: He's a very enthusiastic minister of environment.&#13;
&#13;
                                   Saleh Afiff&#13;
                           November 26, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: That was thirteen years ago, in other words. And the first environment&#13;
conference was also in the '70s in Stockholm. There is when we start . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That was in '72.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: And Emil was representing Indonesia at that time.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, is that so? I see.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: So you were worrying about this before the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: No, the World Bank, you know--I'll have to be fair with them, because this&#13;
Gloria--who is it--I forget the name. Gloria . . .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Gloria Davis?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Yes. She is--she is earlier in the transmigration.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: She now heads the Asia technical environment.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: But the Bank wasn't much into environment stuff in â&#128;&#152;78.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: In â&#128;&#152;78.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I donâ&#128;&#153;t think so. There had been a big--of course, everybody went to the&#13;
conference.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Who else is it in â&#128;&#152;78?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Who else was?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Yeah, except the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, I think you may have been by yourself because in the early â&#128;&#152;70s there&#13;
was a great concern about the environment in the United States, and they came out with a&#13;
book called Limits of Growth. The whole planet was going to implode, sort of, because of&#13;
environmental stress and population stress. It was very sound stuff except it was about a&#13;
generation or two ahead of its time. It was sort of likeâ&#128;&#148;what am I trying to say?â&#128;&#148;&#13;
shouting, what is it, shouting â&#128;&#156;Fireâ&#128;&#157; ahead of time--crying "Wolf!" And so that whole&#13;
wave of concern kind of subsided. People were worried about food. They were worried&#13;
about population, and they were worried about equity in the â&#128;&#152;70s. And the environmental&#13;
thing has been sort of incrementally gathering strength, I think, through the â&#128;&#152;80s, and this&#13;
Gro Bruntland commission focused a lot of attention. Now it's for real. I mean, theyâ&#128;&#148;I&#13;
don't think the Bank has been ahead of the team, I mean ahead of the wave on this. I think&#13;
they've just sort of gone along with the fashion, don't you?&#13;
&#13;
                                   Saleh Afiff&#13;
                           November 26, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Oh, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: They haven't led, been a leader in this.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I don't remember hearing the word . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: In the â&#128;&#152;70s?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: . . when I was in the government of Peru through â&#128;&#152;85.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: No, but just a momentâ&#128;&#148;youâ&#128;&#153;ll have to do some checking for me; I don't recall&#13;
exactly. In the--almost in every loan agreement of a project, but starting when I don't&#13;
know, there is always the requirement that the government will take care of the&#13;
environmental impact or something like that.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, they tried to . . .&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: That is a . . .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: That's about two years old. [all speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: No, no, the two years old is you have to, you need an environmental impact&#13;
analysis before a project could be appraised. That is two years ago, but years ago it was a&#13;
very general statement.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I bet you that's an influence of the U.S., and my little summary a moment ago&#13;
neglected the fact that that first burst of attention created something called the&#13;
Environmental Protection Agency in the United States and the Council of Environmental&#13;
something-or-other, and we had therefore a requirement that all kinds of things had to&#13;
pass muster for environmental impact in the U.S. And Iâ&#128;&#153;d bet you that that got sort of&#13;
carried over to World Bank boilerplate, but it didnâ&#128;&#153;t really get much attention. It also lost&#13;
of its meaning in the U.S. case for a while, but . . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Youâ&#128;&#153;re a good lawyer for the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Am I? [Laughter] No, I have to be fair. I don't know. I know the Bank, as I&#13;
said, since â&#128;&#152;68, you know, thatâ&#128;&#153;s the thing, being the bureau chief here and then suddenly&#13;
it seems to me the A-B-C. There's a lot of theologies in the Bank, thatâ&#128;&#153;s for sure.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That's right. There are a lot. It's not a monolith.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Have you seen a shift in the theology?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: What does--I don't see, believe the theology, you know, the way they work,&#13;
procurement on consultants.&#13;
&#13;
                                    Saleh Afiff&#13;
                            November 26, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The policies they're pushing are not very . . .&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Policies is--in my book policies are not theology; it is the procedures with them.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Okay, all right.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Procedures that say what we cannot do. For example, one of the procedures&#13;
which I would like to do is why only 15 percent margin of preference to domestic&#13;
industries? Why not 25 percent? Why donâ&#128;&#153;t give all domestic industries a better chance to&#13;
participate? Thatâ&#128;&#153;s the Board [of Executive Directors] --once you said the Board, this is&#13;
theology. [Laughter] But in policies we might, you know, we might agree with them. We&#13;
might agree with them. We appreciate additional comments to our priorities and so on,&#13;
but if not, then . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Were the policies they are favoring, have they been a strong continuity through&#13;
these 20 years? Or do they, have they shifted?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Well, you know, it would be interesting for you if you can read the economic&#13;
reports from year to year which we submitted to the IGGI, you see. But that is the&#13;
projections, the projection what will happen next year: â&#128;&#156;We will have prudent&#13;
borrowing; the next years you have less borrowing,â&#128;&#157; and something like that, you know.&#13;
It is always changing.&#13;
&#13;
But because the consistency is, I said--I must say, although you say that to me, they have&#13;
assisted us quite a lot. You know, in the most difficult years when we have the sharp&#13;
decline of oil, we have the structural adjustment. We--our own decision to change, to&#13;
deregulate--maybe the term is â&#128;&#156;to liberalize,â&#128;&#157; but we donâ&#128;&#153;t like it; â&#128;&#156;deregulateâ&#128;&#157; is better.&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: They assisted us. And also they have an influence on bilateral countries, Japan.&#13;
They can talk on our behalf with the Japanese, influence. You know, they have the&#13;
analysis, the economic analysis of [inaudible] So if we submit for additional aid offered,&#13;
if we submit it ourselves the lending country or aid-giving country might be questioning a&#13;
lot of things. But if it is the World Bank, an international institution, it goes easier. But if&#13;
they heard nothing, of course they don't like this, I mean the country report.&#13;
&#13;
So they have been supporting us quite well, relatively in terms of structural adjustment&#13;
loans, relative to the Japanese government, for example. They are small, what the World&#13;
Bank did. But what they give, as an example, give confidence. Once the Bank has&#13;
confidence to give a couple of hundred structural adjustment loans, others follow. That is&#13;
why I consider them very helpful.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Weâ&#128;&#153;re not--I don't want you to misunderstand. Weâ&#128;&#153;re not critics of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                         15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: No, no, I know.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Just interested in understanding how it works.&#13;
&#13;
One thing thatâ&#128;&#153;s different here in Indonesia is the stability of the personnel in government&#13;
here.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Yeah. Or the immobility! [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Your personnel is much more stable than the Bank's.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Oh, yes. That weâ&#128;&#153;ve certainly had.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: How has that affected your relationship, the fact that they're always changing&#13;
people?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Well, we have problems with the changes sometimes, you know.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: They forget things?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: No, to a more difficult person, more, less--they donâ&#128;&#153;t trust us, less, for example,&#13;
you know, something like that. Yeah, we have problems.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Do you have to teach them about Indonesia all over again?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: How do you mean?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Each time thereâ&#128;&#153;s a new person, do you haveâ&#128;&#148;do you feel you have to teach&#13;
them or educate them about Indonesia all over again?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: No, I think not in that sense. When I saidâ&#128;&#148;for example, if the vice president&#13;
would change of the region [inaudible] change, if that changed, they might change&#13;
policies because of it. They might change preferences, and they change personnel:&#13;
persons we know each other, we trust each other, suddenly goes to other divisions in&#13;
other areas. That is for us not a pleasant thing, but we are aware that that is Bank&#13;
business, and so we adjust ourselves to that.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Is that worse when it happens in Washington or here?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: It depends on the person. [Laughter] It depends on the person. We don't have&#13;
problems on this side so far.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Very good relationship here.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Yes, very good.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, one case, at least, the man here moved to Washington, Russ [Russell J.]&#13;
Cheetham, and he then took his sort of seniority with him.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Russ Cheetham was the most senior since Bernie Bell, of course.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, yes.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: He has direct access to . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, that's very true. But McNamara hasâ&#128;&#148;weâ&#128;&#153;ve interviewed McNamara a&#13;
number of times, and heâ&#128;&#153;s told us at some length about that case, of why he came here,&#13;
and the way he instructed that Bernie should have a direct line to him and no one else&#13;
should countermand his proposals.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: I have--I'm sorry. I'm a little bit wrong in the INPRES lately. It is out of 11.2&#13;
trillion, 3.3 trillion is.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: 3.3 out of 11.2?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That's about 30 percent.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: And that is still about two percent of GDP.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Itâ&#128;&#153;s about two percent.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Has it been growing?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Oh, yes.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: It has.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: This year's growth was 40 percent relative to . . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Do you use--are the INPRES funds used in practice for health and education?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Well, health and education, health, education.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Family planning?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: No, not family planning. Grants to the provincial governments, district&#13;
governments, villages, and then reforestation for marginal lands, you know, for theâ&#128;&#148;is&#13;
this right: â&#128;&#156;marginal landsâ&#128;&#157;?&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                        17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Well, you know, for making dams, small dams, and so on. So it's really--and&#13;
then road construction, rural road construction, and provincial roads.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: But is all of that delegated to local governments?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: All of that, including health and education?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: They decide how to spend it?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Well, there is some directives, perhaps. In the area where population density is&#13;
so, then you can build two health clinics and in the elementary schools, one.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Because at the same time you have big central government health programs,&#13;
World Bank programs on education and such.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: But the World Bank education program does not go down to the elementary&#13;
school. They start now. They start. No, our problem is, you know, we have the&#13;
servicesâ&#128;&#148;I mean, we have expanded the availability of elementary schools all over the&#13;
country, but now we need to improve the quality, and that is where the World Bank has&#13;
made a study and preparing the projects.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: How many people do you employ in the INPRES program? Do you know?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: These are regional government projects, but for 65,000 elementary schools, for&#13;
example, the teachers, if you put 65,000, we have about 900,000. You know, that is with&#13;
theâ&#128;&#148;say, each school has six teachers.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Okay. [all speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s about 400,000.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: 400,000.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Then they have watchmen each.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: But you also must have quite a lot of construction in the works.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Oh, yes, in the rural roads.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  Saleh Afiff&#13;
                          November 26, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Rural roads, yeah, yeah. Do you . .&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Now, I said that this is all rupiah, but World Bank as well as Asian&#13;
Development Bank and other members of the IGGI sometimes will have projects for&#13;
rural roads development, district and kabupaten. And we use the local cost funding from&#13;
this.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You use the . . .&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: You know, say, the World Bank financed rural roads. Rural roads is regional&#13;
responsibility. They get funding from the central government through the INPRES, but&#13;
so--and usually it is in civil works, the sharing of the project costs, say, 50/50, 50 percent&#13;
World Bank, 50 percent government of Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
[End of Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: The World Bank fund goes through central government, of course.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Right.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Because we lend from them, we have to administer them, and we have the&#13;
payback system, but it is granted to the . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: So this becomes part of the resources that the central government makes&#13;
available through the . . .&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Yes. The INPRES program.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The INPRES program. But the local people--if it's at the village level, then itâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
managed just in the same--those funds or those resources are merged with the other&#13;
resources coming from the center. Right?&#13;
&#13;
Well, this is quite an eye-opener, I think, to us, the scale of this INPRES program. I must&#13;
say that it also puts a rather different face on your development strategy, I think, as&#13;
compared to--I've been picking up the impression of a very stability-oriented set of&#13;
people that want to keep their macro . .&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: We would like to do that, too, but that is sometimes more difficult, you know.&#13;
[Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: We would like that, too. I think that is a condition of stability that--before we&#13;
can do those things. Stability, the macro stability, is very important.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Saleh Afiff&#13;
                            November 26, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, of course. Yeah, yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: That's why weâ&#128;&#148;you know, we have in â&#128;&#152;83-â&#128;&#152;86 when we start deregulating, we&#13;
start with devaluation of the currency. Then we start deregulating, and then our exports&#13;
more or less start growing only after that.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Now that the Indonesian economy has done so much, has grown so much,&#13;
matured much more and so on, does Indonesia need the World Bank now?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Oh, yes. You know, well, Iâ&#128;&#153;ll tell you what. Our strategy has been always in&#13;
borrowing--in foreign aid we need to borrow; our resources cannot carry all the&#13;
requirements of development--is to be, to concentrate more on the soft and less&#13;
concessional borrowing like the bilateral and then World Bank and export-related&#13;
facilities. Late last year, for instance, we received pledges from the IGGI members for&#13;
4.75 billion dollars. That is not enough to build the infrastructure requirements to support&#13;
the growth of the economy, like electricity, telecommunications and roads, for example,&#13;
harbors as well. Domestically, our domestic funds is public savings is that, you know,&#13;
and we would like to give it to INPRES and so on. So now we try to encourage private&#13;
sector to participate in the infrastructure development. That was a year and a half ago&#13;
decision; only today perhaps start the negotiations on power. So it takes a long time, and&#13;
if you look at the infrastructure requirement alone, we need more and more foreign&#13;
borrowing. And the parliament doesn't like it, you see, because, â&#128;&#156;Why do you have to&#13;
borrow?â&#128;&#157; But if you want to build something, infrastructure, then if you don't have&#13;
resources, you have to borrow. That's why we need the World Bank moreâ&#128;&#148;not only the&#13;
World Bank, the Asian Development Bank.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Is it that right now itâ&#128;&#153;s the money from the World Bank that's more important&#13;
than other parts?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: What other parts?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: You know, the policy advice, the technical assistance.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Well, for example, technical assistance, we asked the World Bank technical&#13;
assistance how to set up and to safeguard private sector participation in the infrastructure&#13;
development. We asked them and we received them, used them. So now there is a team&#13;
working with the electric power company to set up what would be the best tariff, what&#13;
would be the best agreement, what would be protection for the assets of the government.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: These are World Bank personnel themselves?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: No, they are consultants. Theyâ&#128;&#153;re paid--these are the technical assistance funds,&#13;
and we [inaudible] with them; and even--for example, like, you know, I don't know&#13;
whether you have heard, recently we have established a committee for debt management .&#13;
.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Saleh Afiff&#13;
                            November 26, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Debt management?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Mr. Radius [Prawiro] is the chairman. Because our commercial borrowing has&#13;
been growing quite rapidly, and this is--we are worried about. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s why we put a brake&#13;
on state-related projects; we have put a brake especially from Pertamina. Then we asked&#13;
them, we asked the World Bank also advice on projections, balance of payments and so&#13;
on and so forth. So there's still a dialogue on the macro affairs still with the resident staff,&#13;
and since the Bank is responsible for preparing the economic reports in the IGGI, this&#13;
dialogue has to be an ongoing thing.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: And they have good suggestions, but there are also suggestions we cannot&#13;
accept. We don't . . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Here in BAPPENAS [Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional, National&#13;
Development Planning Board] do you have a feel--I imagine youâ&#128;&#153;re all the time worrying&#13;
about the way projects are carried out within the government, the implementation. There&#13;
are all these lovely plans to do this, this, this, and you allocate the money, and you give it&#13;
ministries and so on, slowly, make mistakes, so on. There must be continuous&#13;
frustration. Does the World Bank help you very much at that level?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Not much in these cases. But we have two bureaus, monitoring bureaus, for&#13;
project implementation. One is the rupiah part, which doesn't have anything to do with&#13;
the foreign aid, and the other is only foreign aid. This bureau of foreign aid have contacts&#13;
regularly with the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and other bilateral countries to&#13;
monitor the disbursements because that is other than project performance. Disbursements&#13;
we monitor because we were--five years ago or six years ago our disbursement level&#13;
declined. So the president made a special team, and I was and I am still the chairman of&#13;
that team, and they gave a lot of authority to push departments to speed up&#13;
disbursements, to speed up contracts, to speed up tendering, to speed up everything.&#13;
&#13;
But whether the project is implementing what is agreed upon between the aid givers and&#13;
us is very difficult to monitor at that stage. We need to, yet . . .&#13;
&#13;
But the Bank has this six monthsâ&#128;&#148;how do you call itâ&#128;&#148;they have this six months . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Supervision?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Supervision. They--after that they come to us: â&#128;&#156;The water charges for irrigation&#13;
is not in place,â&#128;&#157; or â&#128;&#156;Planting is not late,â&#128;&#157; and so on, which we cannot see from&#13;
disbursement level. Then we work on it. We have two bureaus and one deputy, under one&#13;
deputy, working for monitoring implementation.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Is this an important assistance for you, do you think?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Saleh Afiff&#13;
                             November 26, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Oh, real assistance. I donâ&#128;&#153;t . . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: The supervision?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: The supervision, yes.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yes. It is extra eyes.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Extra eyes.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Even here, even in the disbursement level, we receive information from the&#13;
Bank: â&#128;&#156;Mister BAPPENAS, this year's disbursement of all World Bank projects in&#13;
August is so much.â&#128;&#157; And we note that and compare it with last year's or other previous&#13;
ones, and then if we saw a decline, why and so on and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: But I meant more generally. All of this depends on the efficiency,&#13;
administrative efficiency, of all your directorates.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Exactly.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Now all the usual problems, bureaucratic problems, does the Bank interaction&#13;
with, at these lower levels . .&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: In BAPPENAS?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: No, in the government in general. [both speaking at once] Is that an important&#13;
contribution, do you think? I mean, one looks at the number of Bank people. There are&#13;
thousands of man-years coming and going, and they're going all over the government, all&#13;
over Indonesia, talking all the time to government officials. Is that helping that? Or is it&#13;
mostly for the Bank's own purposes, monitoring, control?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: No, let's put it--there stages of projects, okay? Before the loan negotiations is&#13;
the appraisals, the pre-appraisals, the appraisals and so, until it is negotiated. This is a&#13;
different group of people. We have to provide them information and so on and so forth, to&#13;
assess the feasibility of our project. This is different groups. Once it is negotiated and&#13;
implemented, then you have that six months supervision start rolling, yeah? Start that&#13;
supervision that report to us: â&#128;&#156;In the agreement you said within six months of the signing&#13;
of the project of the agreement you will establish a supervision team or a reviewing team&#13;
or something like that, but to date you haven't done that yet.â&#128;&#157; Something like that, you&#13;
know. That is the most simplest. Then when thereâ&#128;&#153;s smaller progress, say in irrigation,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;You havenâ&#128;&#153;t established the water charges,â&#128;&#157; water fees, as it is called, or â&#128;&#156;Extension&#13;
services are not thereâ&#128;&#157; [inaudible] Then this is to us a sign, and our bureaus, the two&#13;
bureaus, will contact the executing agencies and ask them. Now, whether this is a burden&#13;
or not, we don't feel itâ&#128;&#148;I mean, BAPPENAS. I could not say, you know. You have to&#13;
&#13;
                                    Saleh Afiff&#13;
                            November 26, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ask the technical departments, I mean, the executing agencies.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Let me press you a little bit on this. In terms of the follow-up on the&#13;
performance of the project and the monitoring of the performance of the project after its&#13;
completion . .&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Ah, that's different, after completion. Then you have this other bureau in the&#13;
World Bank, how do you call it?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: OED [Operations Evaluation Department].&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: OED, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: But now my question is: that's the sort of thing that the government of&#13;
Indonesia ought to be able to do for itself, huh?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: We are trying, but we cannot do it yet.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You can't do it yet.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: We are trying, but it's tough. You know, this two-bureau monitoring has been&#13;
suggesting this. But there are a lot of projects, you know, and ours is small because we&#13;
have to work together with the executing agencies to do that or OED. Whatâ&#128;&#153;s . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: OED, Operations Evaluation Department.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: That type of completion report of our projects, we should do it. I agree with&#13;
you, but we are preparing it, but we haven't done it yet. Did I answer your question? [all&#13;
speaking at once] I mean, you know, the supervision reviews might be a pain for the&#13;
executing agency because they are the people who are facing theâ&#128;&#148;not us, not&#13;
BAPPENAS. BAPPENAS receives the report, among others.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: What I was thinking of is something a little more like this: take some&#13;
government bureau, let's say rural health. I assume that every now and then thereâ&#128;&#153;s a&#13;
project, World Bank, that works through that directorate. And over five, ten years thereâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
a continuous contact between maybe someone in the representative office here whoâ&#128;&#153;s a&#13;
health specialist and people in Washington who come in the health area. Sometimes they&#13;
do a report; sometimes they just come and do a conversation. And then there are also&#13;
people coming to look at projects. They sit at a table and they say, â&#128;&#156;Well, what are the&#13;
projects?â&#128;&#157; And they talk, ideas come up, and experts from the Bank, consultants say,&#13;
â&#128;&#156;No, why donâ&#128;&#153;t you--that didn't work very well in Sri Lanka. Why don't you think of this&#13;
other way of doing this?â&#128;&#157; In other words, there is a continuous dialogue, not just at the&#13;
macro level, planning, but at eachâ&#128;&#148;you know? Is that true?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Saleh Afiff&#13;
                           November 26, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Do you think that's important?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Well, you know, how our projects develop actually, like I said . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: And policies, because sometimes it doesn't [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Policy is usually not there at the lower levels. In my opinion the deputy . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Or detailed policies.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Such as, for example?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Well, just the choices amongst health delivery systems. You have a lot of&#13;
detailed decisions to make. Do we put this in charge of the village or at the next level?&#13;
Do we use this kind of a--more technical decisions, really, but theyâ&#128;&#153;re like policies in that&#13;
sometimes they have . . . Do we charge or not charge? Those are the kinds of things.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Yeah, I do, I do. Okay. Let's see. I mean, question is how do we develop&#13;
projects with Bank. First, of course, thereâ&#128;&#153;s a dialogue like [inaudible] The first years we&#13;
would like A, B, and seems to be agreement. Now our main interest is, in addition to the&#13;
infrastructures, human resource development, well, improvement of quality of basic&#13;
systems, quality, okay, of health and education. How do you develop this? And they start&#13;
talking, you know, about the technical aspects. And it comes to a project design where&#13;
policy implications are involved: How do you deal with remote areas? How do you&#13;
improve the quality of an elementary school in Irian Jaya in a place of nowhere&#13;
[inaudible] communication is very difficult and so on? How do you motivate the&#13;
teachers? How do you train them better? How do you--curriculum so it is more suitable&#13;
to the direct environment of the area. Based on these things we develop during that&#13;
assessment. And then it comes up to a higher level. What are the implications? Budget--&#13;
how do we channel the budget? How do we channel the funds in a remote area where&#13;
there is no banking system, there is no [inaudible] This is being discussed. And then we&#13;
come to a project design agreement. Sometimes it is in the pipeline of the previous&#13;
project; for example, Health I is a study to improve the health system in a certain area.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: If the Bank said, â&#128;&#156;No more loans for Indonesia. We donâ&#128;&#153;t have any moreâ&#128;&#148;we&#13;
don't want to lend any more money to Indonesia,â&#128;&#157; but you need to continue investing,&#13;
would you hire them as consultants?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Are they consultants, the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: No!&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Hypothetical question! [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: They are not consultants, yeah. But as I said, you know, there are good people&#13;
among them, but there are also--if they are not happy . . .&#13;

                            November 26, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah, okay.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: But they do really get a hearing because they do bring some money, huh, in&#13;
part?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Yeah, but we don't always agree with the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, no, no, no. I know that. I know that. No, I don't think you're being led&#13;
around by the nose at all. [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: It looks more the other way, I think. [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: In several projects we do more. This INPRES is one of them. But others we&#13;
say, â&#128;&#156;No, we don't go there.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: What was the reason that they wanted a project and you didn't?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Well, for example, they would like to improve civil service.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Civil service, huh.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: But linked to it is autonomy, giving autonomy to all gubenors to district levels. I&#13;
consider that that is domestic. Not a single consultant outside Indonesia could do the job&#13;
because it has very psychological implications. There is also an institutional which is&#13;
very difficult to be, and I'm afraid that they will come with crazy ideas. The consultants&#13;
they hired, they asked groups how to improve the autonomy of the regions.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Any possibility that they could hire an Indonesian consultant?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: They could, they could have, but then you have to run into this damn theology:&#13;
a file with rank and so on or something like that of procurement.&#13;
&#13;
But the other hand, training civil servants, okay. We have already a world of training&#13;
through indirect, you know, sources, government sources and others, of the civil service--&#13;
sorry, of the regional civil service. So we say, â&#128;&#156;No.â&#128;&#157; They are very unhappy about it. Of&#13;
course, the division chief who is preparing the project is not happy.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: This was a recent?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Very recent. For example, assistance to the [inaudible] almost a cabinet level&#13;
committee for autonomy. Itâ&#128;&#153;s not their place. We say, â&#128;&#156;No, we donâ&#128;&#153;t want.â&#128;&#157; [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, thatâ&#128;&#153;s theâ&#128;&#148;thereâ&#128;&#153;s a problem with a very sophisticated organization that&#13;
has been like chartered, confined to a certain range of subject matter, makes basically&#13;
economic technical engineering, now finds reason, I think quite rightly, to worry about&#13;
&#13;
                                   Saleh Afiff&#13;
                           November 26, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the quality of governance as being very important to this, but they don't have a lot of&#13;
expertise in terms of governmental structures and politics. They can be kind of a bull in a&#13;
china shop, I guess.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: What else are you--I don't know what you need--but we sometimes we don't&#13;
want, donâ&#128;&#153;t do the projects.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Has that been increasing?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Not too many, really, not too many, but because had this developed together,&#13;
and this part I donâ&#128;&#153;t--when it comes, as I said, at the lower level, as you said, technical--I&#13;
receive a protest from my colleague ministers who would like to continue with that&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: I say no because this is not onlyâ&#128;&#148;â&#128;&#156;If you want really a technical assistance to&#13;
your office, then I will try to find it from a bilateral country, which is on a technical&#13;
assistance form, but not a World Bank [inaudible] concessional loans.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: The Bank now is also trying much harder to go down to lower levels, grassroots&#13;
groups, to find ways of lending that are based in a more decentralized and detailed way,&#13;
particularly in the areas of population, delivery, health and education and so on. One of&#13;
the things they're doing is dealing more with NGOs [non-governmental organizations]&#13;
because NGOs, they think, are good at [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Theyâ&#128;&#153;re scared of NGOs.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: They're scared . . .&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: In Washington because they don't want to finance hydropower dams now.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: There are very mixed feelings, yeah. But my question was . .&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Well, you have developing of countries through hydropower.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Theyâ&#128;&#153;ve spent a lot on it.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Do you think the Bank can do things like that, or should they stick to big&#13;
projects, infrastructure?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: No. It is our priority, actually, that foreign borrowing should basically be more&#13;
for infrastructure projects, and that will be the role of the government of Indonesia&#13;
because we don't want industry [inaudible] infrastructure development. Well, of course&#13;
we have this obligation of poverty alleviation of pockets in Indonesia that's not truly&#13;
relieved by growth. How do you do that? And then our sources is better because we are&#13;
&#13;

                            November 26, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
more flexible. I mean, you know, we don't have that type of theology. We are more&#13;
flexible, changing it. Okay, if you design a project is not, somewhere in North Sulawesi&#13;
or something, it's not suitable, then we can change it, where with aid givers sometimes&#13;
you have to go to the capital for changes of the design of a project.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: This includes other donors as well?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Yeah. So my view is actually--our view--we can do better social and poverty&#13;
alleviation projects than any other donor, but the other members of the IGGI is obligated&#13;
by parliament and also perhaps in the Bank by your Board of Directors, to do this type of&#13;
loans, to do this type of projects.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Or in McNamara's time by the president.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Huh?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: In McNamara's time it was by order of the president that they were pushing&#13;
very hard on poverty-related projects. And they're doing that some now, you know.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: But that creates a conflict that you were dealing with.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Yes. You know, in the earlier years when we have a transmigration project, we&#13;
want to build a house for a transmigrant, and the design has to be approved by the central&#13;
office, the design of a very simple house! If we need a yard bigger than that, I mean for&#13;
[inaudible] for example, the family, we have to go upstairsâ&#128;&#148;or changing the window&#13;
from the left to the . . ! That was back in the early â&#128;&#152;70s. It's changed now. [Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: That was the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: That's why I insist actually more authorities in the [inaudible] here, and I insist&#13;
that not only to the World Bank but also to the ADB [Asian Development Bank] .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Is there a difference between the two institutions, ADB and World Bank, as&#13;
far as you are concerned?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Not much.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The theology is about the same.&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: The theology is about the same, but the Bank, World Bank is more active in&#13;
policy dialogue rather than Asian Bank.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Asian Bank is a smaller . . .&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: The Asian Development Bank [inaudible] Yeah, it is smaller also. Loans also&#13;
smaller.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But if you had an infrastructure project, it would not really make a difference&#13;
to you if you went to the World Bank or the ADB?&#13;
&#13;
AFIFF: Well, now we start co-financing both with big power [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
Well, I have [all speaking at once] I hope I satisfied your answers.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Itâ&#128;&#153;s very, very . .&#13;
