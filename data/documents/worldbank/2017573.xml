&amp;#12;&#13;
Box 2: Lending Operations Principles&#13;
(i) IBRD makes loans to governments, governmental authorities or private enterprises in the territories of&#13;
member countries. A loan that is not made directly to the member in whose territories the project is&#13;
located must be guaranteed as to principal, interest and other charges by the member or its central&#13;
bank or a comparable agency of the member acceptable to IBRD. A guarantee by the member itself&#13;
has been obtained in all such cases to date.&#13;
(ii) IBRD's loans are designed to promote the use of resources for productive purposes in its member&#13;
countries. Projects financed by IBRD loans are required to meet IBRD's standards for technical, eco-&#13;
nomic, financial, institutional and environmental soundness.&#13;
(iii) In making loans, IBRD must act prudently and pay due regard to the prospects of repayment. Deci-&#13;
sions to make loans are based upon, among other things, studies by IBRD of a member country's eco-&#13;
nomic structure, including assessments of its resources and ability to generate sufficient foreign&#13;
exchange to meet debt-service obligations.&#13;
(iv) IBRD must be satisfied that in the prevailing market conditions (taking into account the member's&#13;
overall external financing requirements), the borrower would be unable to obtain financing under&#13;
conditions which, in the opinion of IBRD, are reasonable for the borrower. IBRD is intended to pro-&#13;
mote private investment, not to compete with it.&#13;
(v) The use of loan proceeds is supervised. IBRD makes arrangements to ensure that funds loaned are&#13;
used only for authorized purposes and, where relevant, with due attention to considerations of cost-&#13;
effectiveness. This policy is enforced primarily by requiring borrowers (a) to submit documentation&#13;
establishing, to IBRD's satisfaction, that the expenditures financed with the proceeds of loans are&#13;
made in conformity with the applicable lending agreements and (b) to maximize competition in the&#13;
procurement of goods and services by using, wherever possible, international competitive bidding or,&#13;
when it is not appropriate, other procedures that ensure maximum economy and efficiency.&#13;
Adjustment Lending                                currency chosen by the borrower: variable-spread&#13;
loans and fixed-spread loans. Variable-spread loans&#13;

Box 5: Guarantee Instruments&#13;
* Partial risk guarantees cover debt-service defaults on a loan that may result from nonperformance of govern-&#13;
ment obligations. These are defined in the contracts negotiated between the government or a government-&#13;
sponsored entity and the private company responsible for implementing the project. The IBRD guarantee is&#13;
limited to backing the government's obligations; the obligations of the private company contained in the&#13;
project agreements are not covered and thus the private lenders assume the risk of nonperformance by the&#13;
private company.&#13;
* Partial credit guarantees are used for public sector projects when there is a need to extend loan maturities&#13;
and guarantee specified interest or principal payments on loans to the government or its instrumentalities.&#13;
This approach may be most appropriate when the lenders are not willing to accept the sovereign risk of the&#13;
host govemment for a term long enough to meet the needs of the project. By guaranteeing later maturities,&#13;
such partial credit guarantees help induce the market to extend the term to the maximum risk it can bear.&#13;
* Policy-based guarantees are partial credit guarantees that cover a portion of debt-service on a borrowing by&#13;
an eligible member country from private foreign creditors in support of agreed structural, institutional and&#13;
social policies and reforms. These guarantees are an extension of partial credit guarantees for projects. The&#13;
guaranteed portion of the debt-service could consist of a combination of interest and principal payments,&#13;
but the actual structure is determined on a case-by-case basis. Eligibility for IBRD adjustment lending is a&#13;
necessary condition for eligibility for this type of instrument. The terms of this instrument are the same as&#13;
project-based partial credit guarantees. Maturity and level of fees will be standard if the guarantee is made&#13;
in situations comparable to those under which a structural adjustment loan would be made; however, if the&#13;
guarantee is made in connection with a special structural adjustment loan, then it will be at special struc-&#13;
tural adjustment loan equivalent terms. This guarantee product was launched in FY 1999. Initially, IBRD is&#13;
proceeding with a pilot program of up to $2,000 million. As of June 30, 2002, $409 million had been&#13;
approved. Once the $2,000 million level is reached, the Executive Directors will review the program.&#13;

Management's Assertion Regarding Effectiveness of&#13;
Internal Controls Over External Financial Reporting&#13;
July 31, 2002&#13;
The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) maintains a system of&#13;
internal control over external financial reporting, which is designed to provide reasonable&#13;
assurance to management and the board of directors regarding the preparation of reliable&#13;
published financial statements. The system contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and&#13;
actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified. Even an effective internal&#13;
control system, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations - including the&#13;
possibility of the circumvention or overriding of controls - and therefore can provide only&#13;
reasonable assurance with respect to external financial statement preparation. Further,&#13;
because of changes in conditions, internal control system effectiveness may vary over time.&#13;
IBRD assessed its internal control system as of June 30, 2002 in relation to criteria for&#13;
effective internal control over external financial reporting described in Internal Control -&#13;
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the&#13;
Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, IBRD believes that, as of June 30, 2002,&#13;
its system of internal control over external financial reporting met those criteria.&#13;

We have examined management's assertion, included in the accompanying "Management's&#13;
Assertion Regarding Effectiveness of Internal Control Over Extemal Financial Reporting", that,&#13;
as of June 30, 2002, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development met the criteria&#13;
for effective intemal control over extemal financial reporting described in "Internal Control -&#13;
Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway&#13;
Commission.    Management is responsible for maintaining effective control over external&#13;
financial reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on mnanagement's assertion&#13;
based on our examination.&#13;
Our examination was made in accordance with attestation standards established by the American&#13;
Institute of Certified Public Accountants and, accordingly, included obtaining an understanding&#13;
of intemal control over extemal financial reporting, testing, and evaluating the design and&#13;
operating effectiveness of internal control over external financial reporting, and performing such&#13;
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our&#13;
examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.&#13;
Because of inherent limitations in any intemal control, misstatements due to error or fraud may&#13;
occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of intemal control over external&#13;
financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that intemal control may become&#13;
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies&#13;
may deteriorate.&#13;
In our opinion, management's assertion that, as of June 30, 2002, the International Bank for&#13;
Reconstruction and Development met the criteria for effective intemal control over external&#13;
financial reporting described in "Intemal Control - Integrated Framework" issued by the&#13;
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission is fairly stated, in all&#13;
material respects.&#13;

International Bank for Reconstruction and Development&#13;
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of the International Bank for Reconstruction&#13;
and Development as of June 30, 2002 and 2001, including the summary statement of loans and&#13;
the statement of subscriptions to capital stock and voting power as of June 30, 2002, and the&#13;
related statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in retained earnings, and cash&#13;
flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended June 30, 2002. These financial&#13;
statements are the responsibility of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development's&#13;
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on&#13;
our audits.&#13;
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United&#13;
States of America and Intemational Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan&#13;
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are&#13;
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting&#13;
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the&#13;
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating&#13;
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable&#13;
basis for our opinion.&#13;
In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial&#13;
position of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development as of June 30, 2002 and&#13;
2001, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the&#13;
period ended June 30, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the&#13;
United States of America and International Accounting Standards.&#13;

b.  Average Maturity - Multicurrency loans. IBRD maintains a targeted currency composition in its multicurrency loans. The present target ratio is&#13;
one U.S. dollarfor every 125 Japanese yen and one euro. These three major currencies comprise at least 90% of the multicurrency loans' US. dol-&#13;
lar equivalent value, with the remainder in other currencies. The composition of the multicurrency loans is affected by the selection of currenciesfor&#13;
disbursements on those loans and by the currencies selectedfor the billing of the principal repayments. Along with the selection of disbursement ctur-&#13;
rencies, IBRD manages the selection of repayment currencies to maintain the alignment of the multicurrency loans' composition with the target&#13;
ratio. The selection of currencies for repayment billing by IBRD precludes the determination of average maturity information for multicurrency&#13;
loans by individual currency. Accordingly, IBRD only discloses the maturity periodsfor its multicurrency loans on a combined U.S. dollars equiva-&#13;
lent basis.&#13;

Management's Assertion Regarding Effectiveness of&#13;
Internal Controls Over External Financial Reporting&#13;
July 31, 2002&#13;
The International Development Association (IDA) maintains a system of internal control over&#13;
external financial reporting, which is designed to provide reasonable assurance to&#13;
management and the board of directors regarding the preparation of reliable published&#13;
financial statements. The system contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken&#13;
to correct deficiencies as they are identified. Even an effective internal control system, no&#13;
matter how well designed, has inherent limitations - including the possibility of the&#13;
circumvention or overriding of controls - and therefore can provide only reasonable assurance&#13;
with respect to external financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in&#13;
conditions, internal control system effectiveness may vary over time.&#13;
IDA assessed its internal control system as of June 30, 2002 in relation to criteria for&#13;
effective internal control over external financial reporting described in Internal Control -&#13;
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the&#13;
Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, IDA believes that, as of June 30, 2002, its&#13;
system of internal control over external financial reporting met those criteria.&#13;

We have examined management's assertion, included in the accompanying "Management's&#13;
Assertion Regarding Effectiveness of Intemal Control Over Extemal Financial Reporting", that,&#13;
as of June 30, 2002, the International Development Association met the criteria for effective&#13;
intemal control over extemal financial reporting described in "Internal Control - Integrated&#13;
Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway&#13;
Commission. Management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over extemal&#13;
financial reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assertion&#13;
based on our examination.&#13;
Our examination was made in accordance with attestation standards established by the American&#13;
Institute of Certified Public Accountants and, accordingly, included obtaining an understanding&#13;
of internal control over extemal financial reporting, testing, and evaluating the design and&#13;
operating effectiveness of internal control over extemal financial reporting, and performing such&#13;
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our&#13;
examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.&#13;
Because of inherent limitations in any intemal control, misstatements due to error or fraud may&#13;
occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of internal control over extemal&#13;
financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that internal control may become&#13;
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies&#13;
may deteriorate.&#13;
In our opinion, management's assertion that, as of June 30, 2002, the Intemational Development&#13;
Association met the criteria for effective internal control over external financial reporting&#13;
described in "Internal Control - Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring&#13;
Organizations of the Treadway Commission is fairly stated, in all material respects.&#13;

We have audited the accompanying special purpose staterents of sources and applications of development resources of the&#13;
International Development Association as of June 30, 2002 and 2001, including the summary statement of development credits&#13;
and statemnent of voting power, and subscriptions and contributions as of June 30, 2002, and the related special purpose&#13;
statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in retained eamings, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in&#13;
the period ended June 30, 2002. These special purpose financial statements are the responsibility of the Intemational&#13;
Development Association's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these special purpose financial&#13;
statements based on our audits.&#13;
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and&#13;
Intemational Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance&#13;
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence&#13;
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles&#13;
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We&#13;
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.&#13;
The accompanying special purpose financial statements were prepared to reflect the sources and applications of development&#13;
resources, operations, and cash flows of the Intemational Development Association to comply with Article VI, Section 11 (a) of&#13;
the Articles of Agreement of the Intemational Development Association, as discussed in Note A to the special purpose financial&#13;
statements, and are not intended to be a presentation in confonnity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United&#13;
States of Armerica or Intemational Accounting Standards.&#13;
In our opinion, such special purpose financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the sources and&#13;
applications of development resources of the Intemational Development Association as of June 30, 2002 and 2001, and the&#13;
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended June 30, 2002 in conformity with&#13;
the accounting principles described in Note A to the special purpose financial statements.&#13;
Our audits were conducted for the purpose of fomiing an opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a whole. The&#13;
Supplementary Information on the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative listed in the table of contents is presented for&#13;
the purpose of additional analysis. This additional information is the responsibility of IDA's management. Such information has&#13;
been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in our audits of the basic financial statements.&#13;
As discussed in Note A to the special purpose financial statements, on May 25, 2001, the Interim Trust Fund was terminated and&#13;
all of its assets and liabilities were transferred to the Intemational Development Association. Accordingly, the infomiation in the&#13;
special purpose financial statements and related notes reflect the combined results of the Intemational Development Association&#13;
and the Interim Trust Fund as if the transfer had been in effect for all periods presented.&#13;
This report is intended solely for the information and use of the Board of Govemors, management, and members of the&#13;
Intemational Development Association. However, under the Intemational Development Association's Articles of Agreemnent,&#13;

fiscal 2003 is a 2001 GNI per capita of $875, using Atlas methodology. To receive IDA resources, countries also meet tests of performance. In excep-&#13;
tional circumstances, IDA extends eligibility temporarily to countries that are above the operational cutoff and are undertaking major adjustment&#13;
efforts but are not creditworthy for IBRD lending. An exception has been made for small island economies (see footnote e).&#13;
e. An exception to the GNI per capita operational cutoff for IDA eligibility ($875 for fiscal 2003) has been made for some small island economies,&#13;
which otherwise would have little or no access to Bank Group assistance because they lack creditworthiness. For such countries, IDA finding is&#13;
considered case by case for the financing of projects and adjustment programs designed to strengthen creditworthiness.&#13;

Note: Amounts exclude disbursements for debt reduction, net advance disbursements, and disbursements under simplified procedures for structural&#13;
and sectoral adjustment loans and disbursements under HIPC Initiative and IDA postconflict grants. Countries eligible to borrow from IBRD and&#13;
IDA are listed in appendix 2. For consistency of comparison, the Republic of Korea and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are included as countries&#13;
eligible to borrow for all periods covered by this table. Korea, a former graduate, again became eligible to borrow in December 1997. The Federal&#13;
Republic of Yugoslavia's eligibility was reestablished in May 2001.&#13;
Amounts may not add to totals because of rounding.&#13;

Note: Countries eligible to borrow from IBRD and IDA are listed in appendix 2. For consistency of comparison, the Republic of Korea and the&#13;
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are included as countries eligible to borrow for all periods covered by this table. The Republic of Korea, a former&#13;
graduate, again became eligible to borrow in December 1997. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's eligibility was re-established in May 2001.&#13;
Amounts may not add to totals because of rounding.&#13;
a. Amounts exclude disbursements for debt reduction and net advance disbursements. Amounts also exclude disbursements for structural and&#13;
sectoral adjustment loans, hybrids (loans that support policy and institutional reforms in a specific sector by financing both a policy component&#13;
disbursed against imports and an investment component), and disbursements under HIPC Initiative and IDA postconflict grants.&#13;
b. Percentages are based on the dollar amounts shown under the total disbursements section. These percentages show both the breakdown between&#13;
countries eligible to borrow from the IBRD or IDA, or both, and countries not eligible to borroxv, for individual goods categories and the share of&#13;
each goods category compared with total disbursements.&#13;
