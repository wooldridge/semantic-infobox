                     MR.    M1cNAMAPA:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     The third project item on our agenda today is&#13;
&#13;
           presented to you under the special procedure which the&#13;
&#13;
           Board adopted sometime ago.        It is a proposed loan in the&#13;
&#13;
           amount of $5 million equivalent to the Ivory Coast for an&#13;
&#13;
           education project.        According to that procedure, we will not&#13;
&#13;
           introduce it, there will be no discussion of it unless&#13;
&#13;
           certain individual Directors have particular questions they&#13;
&#13;
           wisa to raise.&#13;
&#13;
                     Mr.    Islam.&#13;
&#13;
                     IR.    ISM:       Thank you,   Mr.   Chairman.&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL                                                                   63&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                        I am aware this project has been processed as a&#13;
&#13;
           special procedure.            With your permission, I would like to&#13;
&#13;
           raise one or two points.&#13;
&#13;
                        With regard to the first                   point, I would like to&#13;
&#13;
           draw attention to paragraph 12,                  page 4,    of the President's&#13;
&#13;
           report.    It seems that the Ivory Coast is now facing a&#13;
&#13;
           peculiar situation which she cannot impose any direct&#13;
&#13;
           control   to limit       private      transfer     of    foreign exchange.&#13;
&#13;
           On the other hand,          she is     heavily being drained of her&#13;
&#13;
           hard-earned foreign exchange resources by transfer of $100&#13;
&#13;
           million by the expatriate wage earners and a further&#13;
&#13;
           substantial amount by the other foreign investors.&#13;
&#13;
                        It    is   mentioned here in          this report that the&#13;
&#13;
           Ivory Coast cannot impose any effective                     steps to stop transfer&#13;
&#13;
           of resources because it             would adversely affect its         poorer&#13;
&#13;
           neighbors.        Some of the measures initiated in recent years&#13;
&#13;
           nave not apparently brought the desired result.                      So I would&#13;
&#13;
           like to hear some comments about the Bank's thinking as to&#13;
&#13;
           how the situation should or could be handled in the Ivory&#13;
&#13;
           Coast.&#13;
&#13;
                        The second point            --&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. McNAMARA:           Which situation?&#13;
&#13;
                        MR.     ISLAM:        This drainage of foreign exchange&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY (ONFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                        64&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           resources through unlimited transfers.&#13;
&#13;
                        The second point I would like to mention here is&#13;
&#13;
           that the education sector already takes about 35 percent of&#13;
&#13;
           the national budget.     This is already too high, and one of&#13;
&#13;
           the reasons for this listed here is that the high cost of&#13;
&#13;
           expatriate secondary teachers.      This also is a source of&#13;
&#13;
           heavy drainage    of foreign exchange to the country.&#13;
&#13;
           Therefore,    replacing these by locally trained teachers&#13;
&#13;
           should be one of the basic objectives     of education reform&#13;
&#13;
           in the Ivory Coast.     But in the two Bank projects, the present&#13;
&#13;
           one and the earlier one, we seem to be concentrating on the&#13;
&#13;
           training of primary school teachers, and although we have&#13;
&#13;
           identified the problem which is to replace the more expensive&#13;
&#13;
           expatriate secondary scnool teachers by local, so far we&#13;
&#13;
           don't seem to have done anything towards this objective.&#13;
&#13;
                        Even in the third project it appears from the&#13;
&#13;
           outline given here that the training of secondary school&#13;
&#13;
           teachers of local origin is not a part.      So I would like to&#13;
&#13;
           have some comments as to whether this aspect is important&#13;
&#13;
           enough to be included as a part of the Bank project and, if&#13;
&#13;
           not, what the country is proposing to do about it.&#13;
&#13;
                        Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. McNAAhRA:   Mr. Koenig, would you respond to the&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY C NFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                                     65&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           first question.       What, if anything, can the Bank do with&#13;
&#13;
           respect to the problem of the remittances from nationals of&#13;
&#13;
           Upper Volta and surrounding countries?&#13;
&#13;
                        MR.   KOENIG:      Mr. Chairman,   I would like to refer&#13;
&#13;
           this question maybe to Mr. Letham who has been following this&#13;
&#13;
           problem closely, if I may.&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. McNAMARA:        Surely.&#13;
&#13;
                        MR. LETHP1:        Mr. Chairman, I would wish to indicate thz&#13;
&#13;
           in relation to the question of replacement of teachers --&#13;
&#13;
                        MR.   M4cNAMARA:     No,   not teachers.     This is   the&#13;
&#13;
           question of remittances by nationals of surrounding countries&#13;
&#13;
                        Let me give the answer.          Nothing.     (a) Because&#13;
&#13;
           the procedures and rules of the area and the region won't&#13;
&#13;
           permit it;    (b) because these remittances are very important&#13;
&#13;
           transfers of resources from Ivory Coast to the surrounding&#13;
&#13;
           countries     and are major contributing factors to strengthen-&#13;
&#13;
           ing the very weak surrounding economies.                So I don't believe&#13;
&#13;
           that we have a capability to do anything about it, but neithez&#13;
&#13;
          would we recommend that they be stopped.                 Instead, we would&#13;
&#13;
           recommend that Ivory Coast build up its export capacity and&#13;
&#13;
           its foreign exchange earning capability.&#13;
&#13;
                        And we have at times given special consideration&#13;
&#13;
           to Ivory Coast's needs for external capital in order to&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY ( ONFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                          66&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           stimulate export growth, because of the contribution that the&#13;
&#13;
           Ivory Coast is making to the surrounding countries through&#13;
&#13;
           these remittance transfers.&#13;
&#13;
                       Now, on the second question, Mr. Koenig, would you&#13;
&#13;
           or one of your associates respond to that?        Is it not a fact&#13;
&#13;
           that the high education expenditures do reflect high costs of&#13;
&#13;
           expatriate secondary teachers?     And if it is such a fact,&#13;
&#13;
           why haven't we done something about it in our projects?&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. LETH#M:   Mr. Chairman, indeed, and I think some&#13;
&#13;
           of the work which was done during the employment mission&#13;
&#13;
           which was reflected in the model developed for the economy&#13;
&#13;
           of the Ivory Coast indicated that the major drain on the&#13;
&#13;
           country's foreign resources were payments to expatriate&#13;
&#13;
           manpower, and in particular expatriate teachers.&#13;
&#13;
                       Now, the question has been how to go about compensat-&#13;
&#13;
           ing the lack of teachers in an economy which around 1969 was&#13;
&#13;
           only graduating about 280 young people at secondary level&#13;
&#13;
           diploma.    What has happened is that the Government has put its&#13;
&#13;
           priority on expanding the base of its education system.        It&#13;
&#13;
           has remarkably succeeded in this.      It is now filling the&#13;
&#13;
           requirements   for primary teachers   and moving into   the filling&#13;
&#13;
           of the requirements for lower secondary and upper secondary&#13;
&#13;
           teachers.&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                      67&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    We have been particularly concerned during the&#13;
&#13;
          first education project in ensuring that there would be a&#13;
&#13;
          gradual increase in the output of primary teachers --   of lower&#13;
&#13;
          secondary teachers.   Now, there is a difficulty there in&#13;
&#13;
          attracting and retaining lower secondary teachers when the&#13;
&#13;
          other sectors of the economy are claiming similarly and&#13;
&#13;
          possibly at higher wages people with similar qualifications.&#13;
&#13;
          However, while in appearance we are not providing financing&#13;
&#13;
          for training of secondary teachers, these people in the case&#13;
&#13;
          of Ivory Coast should not be considered exclusively as being&#13;
&#13;
          generated from secondary teacher training colleges.     Secondary&#13;
&#13;
          teachers are also people who have graduated from the universit&#13;
&#13;
          where the expansion has become considerable and flow onto the&#13;
&#13;
          labor market including onto secondary education.&#13;
&#13;
                    In the preparation of the second project, we had&#13;
&#13;
          considered the requirements for training secondary teachers&#13;
&#13;
          at the lower level and    pending the conclusions of the&#13;
&#13;
          Education Review Commission, we have not proposed to prepare&#13;
&#13;
          at this point a training program for these teachers, but it&#13;
&#13;
          is in our intention to continue monitoring the developments&#13;
&#13;
          in secondary teacher training and in fact the training of&#13;
&#13;
          lower secondary teachers is most likely to be considered as&#13;
&#13;
          part of a third education project for Ivory Coast.&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL&#13;
                                                                    6 o&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    MR. McNAMARA:   Thank you, sir.&#13;
&#13;
                    Are there other Directors who may wish to ask&#13;
&#13;
          questions on this project?&#13;
&#13;
                    If not, we will proceed with it.&#13;
