ABSTRACT&#13;
This paper presents the methodological background to the&#13;
Global Modelling Framework used in the World Development Report&#13;
exercises  of  the World   Bank.    It gives   an overall   view of   this&#13;
framework, discusses in some detail the data base supporting the global&#13;
analysis and the methods of reconciling data from various sources.      It&#13;
presents the new regional classification of countries and discusses the&#13;
three major components of the global framework: the country models, the&#13;
global modelling system, and the sensitivity models.&#13;
This presentation is descriptive. Detailed analytic equations&#13;
of the model structures are not presented in this, paper, but references&#13;
are given to the more technical write ups elsewhere. It is intended for&#13;
an audience familiar with the WDR exercises to give them a more complete&#13;
understanding of the model structure underlying the World Development&#13;
Report's Global Framevork.     It updates and thus replaces World Bank&#13;
Staff Working Paper No. 355 dated September 1979.&#13;
The author wrote this paper while serving as research assistant&#13;

I.       INTRODUCTION&#13;
The World Bank's global analytical system has been developed&#13;
in response to the Bank's need to evaluate long-term development&#13;
prospects of developing member countries and to support its lending&#13;
program and policy dialogue with them.    Much of the Bank's analysis is&#13;
country specific.   But since countries do not develop in isolation, an&#13;
integrated picture of the world economic environment and trends in major&#13;
variables   exogenous   to   developing   countries   is  also   required.&#13;
Accordingly,   a  framework  has   been  constructed   to  ensure  overall&#13;
consistency  in the Bank's    country  analysis.    The global   framework&#13;
described here is intended to satisfy several of the Bank's analytical&#13;
and   policy  needs.      Country  growth   prospects,   creditworthiness,&#13;
appropriateness of sectoral lending programs, and so on, can be reviewed&#13;
in a systematic, internationally comparable framework. For example, the&#13;
trade analysis component provides a consistent set of commodity volume&#13;
and price projections that are used for macro economic and balance of&#13;
payments analysis as well as for the cost-benefit analysis of individual&#13;
projects across all countries.      The annual World Development Report&#13;
(WDR) presents a summary of this global analysis. 1!&#13;
The World Bank's global modelling system is itself dynamic and&#13;
is being developed and modified over time in response to changing Bank&#13;
needs.  The World Bank Staff Working Paper No. 355 entitled "The Global&#13;
Framework",  (R. Cheetham,   S. Gupta and A. Schwartz;    September 1979)&#13;
1/   Presented  initially  to the Board as     "Prospects  for Developing&#13;
Countries",1974-77; published as the World Development Report since&#13;
1978.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
brought the modelling system up to date to September 1979. Since then,&#13;
the system has evolved further, and the emphasis has shifted in several&#13;
areas, including more attention to country specific energy balances, to&#13;
individual country models, and to different regional disaggregation.&#13;
The global modelling system has three components:        country&#13;
models,   a   regional-global   consistency   framework,   and   a  global&#13;
sensitivity model.     These rest on an extensive      data base.    These&#13;
components are discussed in more detail in Parts IV, V, and VI below.&#13;
There are approximately    180 countries or territories     in the world.&#13;
Ideally, each should be modelled individually because no two countries&#13;
face exactly the same economic problems and opportunities. Rowever, the&#13;
costs of such an undertaking would be enormous, so a sample panel of&#13;
developing countries has therefore been selected as the first level of&#13;
the system.    In this exercise,   the first component of the modelling&#13;
system consists of a Sample Panel of 38 countries representing about 80%&#13;
of developing country GNP and population.       (See Annex I for list of&#13;
countries).   In various forns, these countries have been modelled for&#13;
the Bank's operational needs in a simple accounting framework since the&#13;
early 1970s to project economic growth, external trade and capital&#13;
flows.   Adjusting these projections to the global framework provides&#13;
"most likely" base case reference points for those countries and for&#13;
more aggregated regional models.&#13;
The second component of the global modelling system is of a&#13;
global framework comprising 19 regional models (see Annex 2), an&#13;
international trade module, a capital flows module, and a global&#13;
balancing routine.   The 19 regions were established on the basis of GNP&#13;
per capita, geographic location, and oil importing/exporting status.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
Several assumptions are implicit in these classifications: first, that&#13;
the countries in each group face roughly similar development problems;&#13;
second, that they have roughly similar economic systems; and third, that&#13;
they will, under conditions of choice, behave in a generally homogenous&#13;
fashion. To the extent this is not true, the country models can provide&#13;
more detailed analysis of developments and impacts in specific major&#13;
countries.&#13;
The global consistency framework is iterated with the regional&#13;
models to assure that world capital flows are balanced.       The regional&#13;
model results provide extensive data for analysis and inter-regional&#13;
comparisons, including detailed growth rates, trade flows and prices,&#13;
and investment indicators. The direction 'and shifts in global trade and&#13;
capital flows over time can be observed, and so can any changes in&#13;
interactions between the developing and industrialized regions.        The&#13;
modelling framework can generate alternative scenarios, but each full&#13;
scenario requires a great 'deal of manual data preparation and entry, so&#13;
the global framework is used to produce only two scenarios: a "high" and&#13;
a "low" case.   These establish a likely range of global growth patterns&#13;
for relatively optimistic and pessimistic sets of assumptions.&#13;
A "sensitivity model" has been designed as the third component&#13;
of the global modelling system to enable analysts to test the effects of&#13;
different assumptions about regional or global developments without&#13;
having to build a complete scenario in the global and regional models.&#13;
This sensitivity model duplicates the developing country regions of the&#13;
larger model and is calibrated to results of that model for trade, net&#13;
capital  flows,  regional  growth,  and  equilibrium  trade  prices.    By&#13;
exogenously specifying different trade prices, capital flows, or other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
variables, it can test the sensitivity of the base case projections to&#13;
variations in a number of exogenous parameters.      This simulation model&#13;
belongs to the family of Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models and&#13;
can indicate some of the adjustment dynamics occurring in the regions in&#13;
response to changes in exogenous variables or parameters.       However the&#13;
model does not have the detailed capital and trade flows of the global&#13;
framework and does not have the depth of data to generate the complete&#13;
base cases by itself.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
II.      THE DATA BASE&#13;
The data base is essential to the global modelling process,&#13;
and a significant amount of resources are devoted to maintaining it.&#13;
For the fourth WDR (1981), 1978 was chosen as the initial year for&#13;
projections.   Historical data and projections are expressed in 1978&#13;
prices because that was the most recent year for which complete data was&#13;
available.    Population, national accounts, balance of payments, and&#13;
trade data sets have been built up from various sources for benchmark&#13;
years, 1960, 1965, 1970, and 1975-78 for the 38 countries modelled&#13;
individually and for the!t 19 ,regions of the global model-l/ Conventions&#13;
for reconciling data from different sources have been adopted, primarily&#13;
to link trade, balance of payments and national accounts data.      Where&#13;
there are discrepancies, the Balance of Payments figures are given&#13;
priority as the most likely to be accurate and national accounts&#13;
(consumption) or trade (residual) figure adjusted.       Aggregations of&#13;
regional   accounts   include  estimations   for   countries   for  which&#13;
unsatisfactory or no data at all were available.&#13;
The   specific  data  requirements   for  country   and  global&#13;
projections differ in some details.   Both systems use social accounting&#13;
matrices (SAMs) for the initial year to balance and integrate national&#13;
accounts, balance of payments, trade, debt and government finance&#13;
data.   However, the regional model requires an input-output matrix,&#13;
1/   Historical population data is based on United Nations data, except&#13;
in   cases  where   the  Bank   has  more   recent   or  appropriate&#13;
information.   Projections are made country by country, National&#13;
Accounts data from internal Bank sources, Balance of Payments data&#13;
from the Bank's   Debt   Reporting Service and the IMF, and trade&#13;
data from UN sources (series J).&#13;

which is not included in the country model.        The production sector&#13;
breakdown also differs slightly.    The country model has four sectors:&#13;
agriculture, oil and gas, other industry and services; the regional&#13;
model further sub-divides agriculture into food and non-food to match&#13;
the integrated   trade  flows.   The national income accounts for the&#13;
country model disaggregates the industrial origin of gross domestic&#13;
product (GDP) at factor cost and adds indirect taxes to derive&#13;
expenditures on GDP at market pricesl/      In the regional model, both&#13;
products by industrial origin and GDP are at market prices.&#13;
For the regional models, input-output coefficients were&#13;
estimated from the input-output coefficient matrices from the Leontief&#13;
studyZ2/   These were used to disaggregate the regional national income&#13;
accounts to produce the commodity balances for the five production&#13;
sectors specified in the regional model.   These matrices were converted&#13;
to 1978 prices, and revised where new information was available.     Most&#13;
parameters, including consumption coefficients, incremental capital-&#13;
output ratios, import propensities and value added ratios were re-&#13;
estimated to be consistent with 1978 data.     The construction category&#13;
was shifted from the "services" to "other industries".      Once the data&#13;
were compiled, the initial year regional social accounting matrices were&#13;
balanced using the RAS technique 3/&#13;

The regional estimates of the balance of payments capital&#13;
accounts were derived by merging information from the International&#13;
Monetary Fund's Balance of Payments data and the World Bank's Debt&#13;
Reporting System (DRS).    Merchandise imports and exports were compiled&#13;
principally from the United Nations trade system, and energy data were&#13;
obtained from the UN series "J" tapes.&#13;
Not unexpectedly, there are discrepancies in the principal&#13;
data sets when one attempts to produce consolidated accounts, even at a&#13;
regional level.   The greatest difficulty arises in the trade accounts.&#13;
Reporting techniques differ between the IMF and United Nations; the IMF&#13;
receives its data mainly from the central banks, whereas the United&#13;
Nations' trade data are based mainly on customs information.       At both&#13;
the country and regional levels, the UN data is used for the merchandise&#13;
trade items, but the data for goldi/ and non-factor services are taken&#13;
from IMF.    These adjusted trade flows are combined with other IMF&#13;
balance of payments items.     Discrepancies are recorded as a separate&#13;
line item in order to maintain consistency among the national income,&#13;
balance of payments and trade accounts.     Procedures for combining the&#13;
various accounts have also been developed for projection purposes.&#13;
The calculation of terms of trade is by far the greatest&#13;
problem.   A recent survey of World Bank,      IMF, UNCTAD and two UNSO&#13;
sources indicated wide discrepancies in trade price (primarily unit&#13;
1/   The flow of non-monetary gold presents some difficulty.        It is&#13;
recorded by the IMF as an item in the merchandise trade section of&#13;
the balance of payments, but the United Nations system does not&#13;
include it in merchandise trade. Central banks often do not report&#13;
the flow of non-monetary gold or they include it in the reserves&#13;
category, thus distorting the trade account.&#13;
&#13;

value) indices for individual countries and products.      Several studies&#13;
are in progress, notably at UNCTAD, but no systematic terms of trade&#13;
data by product group and country are available for the 1960s and&#13;
1970s. Estimates of terms of trade used in this exercise are derived&#13;
from applying standard price indices to the categories of traded goods&#13;
used in the regional models.     Individual adjustments were made to take&#13;
account of differential product mix within each category in each&#13;
region.&#13;
The sensitivity model draws from essentially the same data&#13;
base as the global model, where additional data was required to estimate&#13;
parameters or provide initialization levels for variables in the&#13;
sensitivity model not present in the regional models, the World Tables&#13;
(op cit.) was the primary source.     If the specific information was not&#13;
available there, other relevant sources were used, as cited in the&#13;
specific documentation for that model.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

III.     NEW REGIONAL CLASSIFICATION&#13;
The regional categories were revised for WDR IV to enable&#13;
policy distinctions to be made between oil importers and oil exporters&#13;
and to distinguish China and Asian CPE's from other (primarily European)&#13;
CPE's.    This  raised the number of regions      from  15 (12 developing&#13;
regions, two developed or industrialized regions, and one region for the&#13;
centrally planned economies (CPE)) in previous years to 19 (15&#13;
developing regions, nine oil importing and six oil exporting; capital&#13;
surplus oil exporting, developed countries, and two CPE's regions - one&#13;
for Asia and one for Europe).     A country is considered an oil exporter&#13;
if its oil exports exceeded 10% of total export earnings in 1978.&#13;
Countries may be classified as oil importing even though they are&#13;
essentially self sufficient in energy.     Both the oil exporters and oil&#13;
importers were grouped geographically and by income level.        Iran was&#13;
placed in a "region" by itself owing to the difficulty of obtaining&#13;
reliable information. (See Annexes 2 and 3).1/&#13;
1/   An effort was made to make the classification consistent with the&#13;
IMF's but agreement could not be reached. The principal difference&#13;
is the inclusion of Spain as a "developing" country in the Bank&#13;
scheme. Differences with the various UN classifications are large,&#13;
particularly with regard to Southern Europe.     See Annex 4.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

IV.      THE COUNTRY MODELS&#13;
The country model exercise enables the Bank to combine the&#13;
detailed knowledge of economists working on particular countries with&#13;
its analysis of global trends and constraints in one consistent&#13;
modelling process.   It also draws substantially on the Bank's work in&#13;
commodity price and export volume projections.&#13;
The selection of countries to be modelled in the Sample Panel&#13;
is based on the country's weight within its region, the availability of&#13;
reliable historical data, and sufficient information for reasonable&#13;
projections to be made.     The unavailability of data accounts for the&#13;
omission of several large countries such as Zaire, from the sample. On&#13;
average, however, the country coverage within each region accounted for&#13;
approximately 75% of the regional population and GNP.          The sample&#13;
includes oil importing countries and oil exporting countries that are&#13;
capital importers, and covers the Bank's principal borrowers. The panel&#13;
also covers the development spectrum, ranging from the poor, largely&#13;
agrarian economies of sub-Saharan Africa to the emerging semi-&#13;
industrialized countries of East Asia, Latin America, and Southern&#13;
Europe.&#13;
The country model used for the 1981 exercise was developed&#13;
using a simple SAM based accounting framework (without the input-output&#13;
relationship) to provide a sufficient degree of endogenous relationships&#13;
and to ensure a measure of data base consistency with the regional&#13;
modelling system. This model was derived from the underlying framework&#13;
of the Revised Minimum Standard Model (RMSM) which has been used in the&#13;
Bank for country economic projections for some time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The country model consists of a domestic activity module, a&#13;
foreign debt module and an external trade module. The domestic activity&#13;
module projects real consumption (private and public) expenditures,&#13;
gross investment and value added (GDP) by three sectors of economic&#13;
activity; agriculture,   industry and services.    The industry sector is&#13;
further disaggregated into manufacturing and energy, including oil and&#13;
gas.   The model projects the levels of national account variables,&#13;
savings and balance of payments in constant 1978 U.S. dollars.     Balance&#13;
of payments projections are converted to current U.S. dollars for&#13;
analysis of financial flows.      Growth rates and other indicators are&#13;
derived from these projections.&#13;
The debt module accepts projected loan commitments of various&#13;
types and generates related disbursement, interest, and amortization&#13;
payments  using  assumed  loan terms.     These  data  are  combined  with&#13;
information from the debt pipeline (disbursements, interest and&#13;
amortization payments calculated from past commitments) produced by the&#13;
Bank's Debt Reporting System.    Debt flows make up the majority of the&#13;
capital account. Other capital account items are projected exogenously&#13;
or derived in the model from accounting relations.&#13;
The foreign trade module projects exports and imports of goods&#13;
and services in constant prices.    Constant price export projections are&#13;
exogenously specified. Several categories of imports are determined by&#13;
elasticity functions in relation to domestic activity, while others,&#13;
notably energy, are exogenously projected.     Current values of imports&#13;
and exports are obtained by applying the appropriate price index&#13;
projections to the projected constant values.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
The exogenous variables for the projections can be separated&#13;
into two categories: those which are mainly external to the country and&#13;
those  which  are  internal.     The  major  external  variables   include&#13;
international interest rates, export volumes, (implicitly assuming&#13;
exports are demand determined), the international inflation rate, and&#13;
relative commodity price movements around this inflation rate. Separate&#13;
interest rate assumptions are made for different types of medium- and&#13;
long-term   loans   to  developing   countries.   Due   to  computational&#13;
limitations, these   terms remain constant throughout the      projection&#13;
period.2!     Exogenous   projections   of  loan   commitments   by   type&#13;
(concessional   or   non-concessional)    and   by   source   (bilateral,&#13;
multilateral, or private) are provided to generate disbursements,&#13;
interest, and amortization payments.&#13;
There are several internal or domestic exogenous variables.&#13;
Some imports are exogenously projected based on separate, global&#13;
analysis.   Gross investment and government consumption are projected&#13;
exogenously and reflect, directly or indirectly, policy choices.       The&#13;
distribution of output by sector (agriculture, industry, other) is also&#13;
determined exogenously.11     Values  of such parameters as tax rates,&#13;
import elasticities, and consumption propensities are chosen to reflect&#13;
a country's policy intentions (as indicated by the Bank's country&#13;
economic analysis).&#13;
1/   These computational limitations have since been overcome and the&#13;
model can now handle both floating and variable interest rates.&#13;
2/   This is due to the lack of an explicit input-output table in the&#13;
model.    These shares change over time in response to expected&#13;
structural change in the economy.&#13;

V.       THE GLOBAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
The second tier of the global modelling system consists of the&#13;
four modules of the Global Framework linked through a recursive&#13;
iterative process: (a) regional models, (b) an international trade&#13;
module, (c) a capital flows module, and (d) a global balancing routine.&#13;
A.       Regional Models&#13;
Cheetham  et  al .i   have  described   the  linear  programming&#13;
regional model for developing countries in detail and only a summary is&#13;
presented here. The model's objective function maximizes the discounted&#13;
value of aggregate output of a given region, subject to constraints of&#13;
technology,  behavior,  domestic policy,   and the external environment.&#13;
The first two constraints enter as parameters estimated from time series&#13;
or cross-country data; the last two groups are specified exogenously.&#13;
Domestic parameters include tax rates, export and import policies, and&#13;
government expenditure, while the international environment includes&#13;
trading policies of neighboring countries, world inflation projections,&#13;
the growth of world trade, and the supply of external capital.         The&#13;
model solves for values for 1980, 1985 and 1990 from a 1978 initial period.&#13;
In broad terms, it is an   "investment-driven",  two-gap model.     Export&#13;
levels, commodity prices, and the total import level are supplied&#13;
exogenously. Disaggregated imports are calculated by the regional model&#13;
using prices as a market clearing mechanism on a sector basis.         The&#13;
composition  of   the  import  basket  is  closely   tied  to  the  sector&#13;
composition of domestic growth. The model considers both&#13;
1/   Op.cit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
supply and demand factors, and discrepancies between regional import&#13;
demands and imports available are resolved in the balancing routine.&#13;
The capital-surplus oil-exporting region, the industrialized&#13;
region, the European centrally planned economies, and the Asian CPE's&#13;
(the China region) are not formally modelled. Projections are only made&#13;
for growth, trade and capital flows, (with various degrees of rigour)&#13;
and fed into the system exogenously in order to complete the global&#13;
balance.&#13;
B.       The International Trade Module 1/&#13;
The international trade component projects trade flows for the&#13;
19 regions comprising the global framework for the following categories:&#13;
CATEGORIES                               SITC Code&#13;
Food                                            0+1+22+4&#13;

2/ Includes non-monetary gold.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
In addition to commodity trade, trade in non-factor services&#13;
is projected using the definitions according to the Balance of Payments&#13;
Manual of the International Monetary Fund.     These include receipts and&#13;
payments for shipment, other transportation, travel, other private&#13;
services and other government services.&#13;
Commodity Models have been developed for 34 non-fuel primary&#13;
commodities, and these are used to project both the export volumes and&#13;
prices (in relation to an international price index) of these&#13;
commodities.   The results are aggregated into three major categories:&#13;
food, non-food agricultural commodities, and metals and minerals.      The&#13;
selected commodities cover between 30 and 80% of total world trade in&#13;
these categories.     The coverage is higher for developing      than for&#13;
developed countries, since commodities were selected on the basis of&#13;
their importance to developing countries 1/&#13;
Projections of petroleum production, consumption, and trade&#13;
were made for each major country. These were the same as those prepared&#13;
for the country models.      These results were then aggregated to the&#13;
regional format.   As projections were not available for trade in coal,&#13;
natural gas or electricity, petroleum trade trends were assumed to&#13;
represent all energy trade (included in the initial year value for SITC&#13;
3).&#13;
The historical manufactured export trend of the various&#13;
regions was used as the basis for the manufactured goods export&#13;
1/   The   aggregated   samples    were   nevertheless   assumed   to   be&#13;
representative   for  the   whole  population;   therefore,   in  the&#13;
production  of  the  trade  projections   for  the  non-fuel  primary&#13;
commodities, the volume growth rates and the prices of the sample&#13;
were applied to the initial year values of the relevant product&#13;
groups in each region.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
projections.   The following procedure was followed:    first, the total&#13;
manufactured goods export projection for all developing countries was&#13;
determined by taking the historical ratio of developing country&#13;
manufactured goods export growth to industrial country GDP growth, and&#13;
applying it to the industrial country GDP growth projection. Second,&#13;
within that overall figure, the growth rates for the individual regions&#13;
were calculated to be proportional to their 1970-78 growth rates to&#13;
insure  a pattern   that would   reflect recent relative    trends.    An&#13;
exception was made for the region that includes Hong Kong, Korea,&#13;
Taiwan, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines.    Manufactured exports&#13;
of these countries have grown very rapidly, by 22% per year between 1970&#13;
and 1978, and it is unlikely that these rates could continue. A rate of&#13;
growth of only 75% of a simple extrapolation was therefore assumed and&#13;
other rates adjusted proportionately.&#13;
Exports of non-factor services were projected by using&#13;
regression based on a cross section analysis2.'&#13;
C.        The Capital Flows Module&#13;
Given   assumptions   about   export   earnings,   the   likely&#13;
availability and terms of official and private capital flows, and&#13;
reserve policy, the capital flows module determines aggregate capital&#13;
flows and allocates these flows by capital importing region as a&#13;
function of the projected level of imports, current account balance, and&#13;

Trends and Current Issues," World Bank Staff Working Paper No.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
debt servicing capacity.   These projections involve a reconciliation of&#13;
supply and demand of capital by successive iterations with the regional&#13;
models.    The  objective  is to match    the allocated  supply with the&#13;
developing regions' needs for external capital to finance imports, their&#13;
ability to service debt, and their desire to maintain reserves, as these&#13;
factors emerge from the interaction of the capital flows and regional&#13;
modelling exercises.    A key element in this whole global framework is&#13;
the ability of the models to iteratively solve for domestic and trade&#13;
performance levels consistent with capital flow availability and its&#13;
serviceability over time.&#13;
Four  different   types  of    capital  flows  are r4presented:&#13;
transfers  from official and private sources,     private direct foreign&#13;
investment,   medium-   and   long-term   loans,  and   "other"   capital.&#13;
Assumptions about the availability of Official Development Assistance&#13;
(ODA) are made as follows. It is postulated that the supply of ODA from&#13;
DAC countries depends on the growth of GNP in these countries, and on&#13;
the policies that they are likely to adopt with regard to the levels and&#13;
the distribution of aid among recipient countries.     Separate judgements&#13;
or assumptions are made with respect to the availability of ODA flows&#13;
from OPEC and "other" sources. The likely flow from each source is then&#13;
disaggregated   into   four  categories:   technical   assistance,   other&#13;
bilateral   grants,   bilateral   loans,   and   flows   to   multilateral&#13;
institutions.   The flows are then aggregated to provide a total of ODA&#13;
flows by type. It should be noted that:&#13;
a.   The portion of ODA that is technical assistance does&#13;
not generally appear in the balance of payments of&#13;
recipient countries since it is seldom possible to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
ascertain and record the receipts involved, and,&#13;
consequently, these flows are netted out from the&#13;
supply  of   ODA  in   projecting  receipts   of  the&#13;
developing country regions in the model.&#13;
b.   Grants   -  including   those   from   bilateral  and&#13;
multilateral sources - are included in the official&#13;
transfers  category.    (This has a small parallel&#13;
entry for private transfers)&#13;
c.   Flows  to   multilateral  institutions   are  treated&#13;
separately.    Although  these contributions form a&#13;
part of, and are a claim on, the total official&#13;
resources ma-e available by donor governments, they&#13;
do not flow directly to developing countries. Flows&#13;
of ODA from multilateral institutions are projected&#13;
on the basis of flows to them and allocated among&#13;
the developing regions on the basis of lending plans&#13;
of these institutions, and&#13;
d.   Different    categories   of    loans   are   treated&#13;
separately.&#13;
Private source loans that carry public guarantees are included&#13;
in the "Public" category as well as the ODA and Official Financial Flows&#13;
(OFF).   Projected   flows  to each region are assumed to follow past&#13;
patterns subject to the creditworthiness of the region and the total&#13;
availability of private source capital.     The latter is derived from a&#13;
global balancing of current account projections for the industrialized&#13;
countries, capital surplus oil exporters, and non-market economies (see&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
* - 19 -&#13;
Annex 8). This result is cross-checked with other factors to assure its&#13;
reasonableness.&#13;
Private direct investment in developing countries is projected&#13;
on the basis of what is currently known about the climate for private&#13;
investment and about the intentions of investors and host countries.&#13;
The category "other capital", is also projected exogenously. In&#13;
practice, it is dominated by short-term capital, and its growth is&#13;
therefore related broadly to the growth in trade of the LDCs.&#13;
Explicit assumptions are made about the supply of each&#13;
category of medium- and long-term loans within the overall structure&#13;
just described.    The main categories identified in the model are as&#13;
follows:&#13;
Loans on Concessional Terms&#13;
From bilateral sources (DAC, OPEC, other).&#13;
From multilateral sources.&#13;
Loans at Market Rates&#13;
Official export credits&#13;
From multilateral sources&#13;
From private sources&#13;
Suppliers' credits&#13;
Financial markets&#13;
The supply of concessional loans is derived from the total&#13;
supply of ODA (less grants) as already indicated. Loans at market rates&#13;
-- official export credits, loans at market terms from multilateral&#13;
sources, private suppliers' credits, and loans from financial markets&#13;
are all projected separately, subject to the projected total&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
availability as discussed above.     Those from multilateral sources are&#13;
projected on the basis of their known lending intentions.&#13;
Historical patterns, the announced -nt-entions of various donor&#13;
groups in the case of ODA, the ability of the various regions to absorb&#13;
loans at market terms as measured by indebtedness, and portfolio&#13;
considerations of private lenders determine the initial allocation of&#13;
these capital flows. This is modified by subsequent iterations with the&#13;
regional models. The creditworthiness analysis (which is related to the&#13;
major countries through the country modelling system) plays an important&#13;
role in the capital allocation exercise. Various debt and debt service&#13;
ratios are also projected on the basis of projected service on debt&#13;
outstanding in the initial year and the terms and amounts of new&#13;
borrowing projected.    These indicators play an important role in the&#13;
iterative analysis to determine the final allocation of medium and long-&#13;
term lending.&#13;
To complete the balance of payments projections, worker's&#13;
remittances are projected on the basis of the GNP growth and policy&#13;
changes in host countries.    Reserves are calculated as a proportion of&#13;
imports.  Investment income receipts are based on the accumulation of a&#13;
region's external assets, primarily reserves. Direct investment income&#13;
payments are estimated in relation to historical flows and the size of&#13;
direct investment flows.&#13;
Interest is calculated in the model for each type of flow with&#13;
appropriate terms.    The debt service ratio is calculated using total&#13;
exports of goods and all services as the denominator.          Balance of&#13;
payments projections for low and middle income oil importing countries&#13;
and for all developing countries are shown in Annexes 6 and 7.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
D.       The Linkage&#13;
The international trade and capital flows modules are linked&#13;
to the regional models through recursive iteration.        From the trade&#13;
module, exports by category and export prices are supplied to the&#13;
regional models.    Then the total export levels are supplied to the&#13;
capital flows module.     The capital flows module produces balance of&#13;
payments and debt projections, as well as potential total import levels&#13;
for each region.    The regional model takes the trade and capital flow&#13;
projections and generates projections of GDP growth, investment, and&#13;
other domestic variables. Once the first round of projections has been&#13;
made, further analysis of the results takes place.     The total regional&#13;
import price derived from that iteration is fed back into the regional&#13;
model for successive iterations until that model stabilizes.         Other&#13;
parameters may be adjusted if large imbalances appear.        Duriig this&#13;
process, the three modules are fine-tuned and prepared for the global&#13;
balancing.&#13;
E.        The Global Balance&#13;
The last stage of the global framework projection exercises is&#13;
a global balancing routine, which is used to appraise the global&#13;
consistency of the regional modelling process. Global trade and current&#13;
account balances provide the global consistency check since world&#13;
markets have to clear, both by commodity for trade and by category for&#13;
the other current account items.     Basically, world exports must equal&#13;
world imports, both in current and constant prices.&#13;
Given the export projections by commodity from the trade&#13;
module and the total import levels from the capital flows module, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
regional  models   produce   import  projections   by  category  for   the&#13;
developing regions and the centrally planned economies. Imports for the&#13;
capital-surplus oil-exporting and industrialized regions are exogenously&#13;
projected on the basis of historical values of import elasticities,&#13;
modified by assumptions of fluctuations in particular commodities' terms&#13;
of trade and country policies.     These projections are carried out in&#13;
1978 constant prices and then inflated to current prices using&#13;
independently projected price series.&#13;
Projected imports are aggregated across regions by commodity&#13;
and then compared to the total exports of the corresponding commodity&#13;
group.  If a discrepancy falls within a statistically acceptable range,&#13;
the group is considered balanced.      Should the discrepancy be large,&#13;
adjustments are made first to the imports of either the capital-surplus&#13;
oil-exporting or industrialized region.    If the necessary changes move&#13;
import levels beyond expected growth paths, then adjustments are made to&#13;
the exports of the industrialized regions.    This process continues for&#13;
each commodity group until the global trade framework is balanced.&#13;
Annex 8 illustrates the outcome.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

VI.       The Sensitivity Model&#13;
A sensitivity model was developed to permit relatively rapid&#13;
running of alternative scenarios around the base case(s) developed in&#13;
the global framework, but at much less cost in staff and computer&#13;
time.!/    It consists   of 16 regional models:    15 for the developing&#13;
regions and one for the aggregated rest of the world.        International&#13;
trade and capital flows provide the links between the 16 regions. Each&#13;
developing region is described by a simple general equilibrium model&#13;
that   is  solved   for  each   period.     There   is  no   intertemporal&#13;
optimization.    The model   consists  of  three  parts:  (a)  the  static&#13;
(general equilibrium) component; (b) the equations which determine world&#13;
trade and prices; and (c) the dynamic component which contains the&#13;
investment components and intertemporal changes that link one period to&#13;
the next. The model is calibrated from the global framework before&#13;
performing the sensitivity tests.      This model was also developed to&#13;
expand the internal flexibility of regional components for policy&#13;
analysis, at some cost in terms of structural, trade, and balance of&#13;
payments detail in comparison to the Global Model.&#13;
The sensitivity model is a Computable General Equilibrium&#13;
(CGE) model which runs in simulation mode, and thus is a different type&#13;
of model from the regional models in the global framework, which are&#13;
input-output based optimizing models. The relative strengths of the CGE&#13;
model for policy analysis and sensitivity testing derive from the&#13;
greater economic content of the domestic parts of the regional submodels&#13;
and the fact that the trade and regional models are integrated and&#13;
1/   See Waelbroeck, J. "A Global Development Model, The M3 Model of&#13;
Developing and Developed Countries", 1978, Centre de'Economie&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
solved in a simultaneous manner.   However it lacks the detailed capital&#13;
flow and commodity trade analysis of the global framework and does not&#13;
work out optimal growth paths.     In its current form, the sensitivity&#13;
model is complementary to the global model, which establishes the basic&#13;
scenarios and detailed flows around which the sensitivity model can test&#13;
the effects of alternative assumptions.&#13;
As a CGE model, the sensitivity model includes domestic&#13;
relative price adjustments to help clear markets by assuming profit&#13;
maximizing behavior on the part of the economic agents, subject to&#13;
various constraints. The domestic sector includes production functions&#13;
by sector that permit substitution of capital and labor as a function of&#13;
relative factor prices, an expanded linear expenditure system that&#13;
determines consumption demand by sector and private saving, and constant&#13;
elasticity of substitution import functions that determine imports as a&#13;
function of domestic and foreign prices.    Rural-urban migration is also&#13;
allowed, which, in addition to natural population increase, determines&#13;
labor available to each sector and affects the equilibrium wage rate.&#13;
The model recognizes that developing economies are "fragmented" and&#13;
perfect mobility of factors     cannot be assumed.     It is possible to&#13;
constrain certain prices and the model will solve, subject to these&#13;
constraints, using its maximization routines. Explicitly there are also&#13;
limits on domestic factor mobility and fungibility of saving; it can&#13;
only be invested in its sector of origin.      Trade is balanced globally&#13;
with both imports and exports adjusting to relative price movements.&#13;
Exports are solved to be equal to imports plus an exogenously assumed&#13;
net capital flow.&#13;
Sensitivity analyses have been performed in several areas&#13;
including the effects of alternate growth rates in the OECD countries on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
growth in the developing countries; the effects of varying capital&#13;
inflows to developing regions; and the effects of changes in oil prices&#13;
and   domestic   adjustment  parameter.      Varying   degrees  of   trade&#13;
protectionism were assumed through changes in the import elasticities&#13;
with respect to GDP growth and price (revenues elasticity of imports).&#13;
The results of most of these sensitivity tests were reported in WDR&#13;
1981.&#13;

            The global framework : an update
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper presents the methodological
            background to the Global Modelling Framework used in the
            World Development Report exercises of the World Bank. It
            gives an overall view of this framework, discusses in some
            detail the data base supporting the global analysis and the
            methods of reconciling data from various sources. It
            presents the new regional classification of countries and
            discusses the three major components of the global
            framework: the country models, the global modelling system,
            and the sensitivity models. This presentation is
            descriptive. Detailed analytic equations of the model
            structures are not presented in this paper, but references
            are given to the more technical write ups elsewhere. It is
            intended for an audience familiar with the WDR exercises to
            give them a more complete understanding of the model
            structure underlying the World Development Report's
            Global Framework. It updates and thus replaces World Bank
            Staff Working Paper No. 355 dated September 1979.
