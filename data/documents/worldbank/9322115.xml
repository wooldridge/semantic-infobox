                          EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
       In July 2002, the World Bank's Human Resources Services Leadership and&#13;
Organizational Effectiveness Group (HRSLO) launched a three-module program for&#13;
newly appointed and recruited managers. This "New Managers' Leadership Program"&#13;
(NMLP) responded to Bank-wide feedback from senior Bank managers, human resources&#13;
managers, and other Bank professionals about the need for such a program. The NMLP&#13;
aims to:&#13;
&#13;
    · Clarify the institution's expectations of managers and strengthen managers'&#13;
         capabilities to deliver results through effective core relationship skills;&#13;
&#13;
    · Increase managers' capabilities to create the results they want in ways that&#13;
         support work-life balance; and,&#13;
&#13;
    · Build managers' knowledge and skills in leading change at their unit level and&#13;
         provide opportunities to apply their new knowledge to work situations as they&#13;
         continue to build the cohort as a learning and support community.&#13;
&#13;
       The NMLP's three modules are presented over a seven- to eight-month period,&#13;
with several weeks separating each module. Each new manager completes all three&#13;
modules, generally with the same managerial cohort. As of the date of this evaluation, 10&#13;
managerial cohorts have completed the NMLP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                             APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY&#13;
&#13;
       This is the second evaluation of the New Managers' Leadership Program&#13;
(NMLP). The first evaluation, Evaluation of New Managers' Leadership Program (Zia,&#13;
Hanson, and Gunnarson 2004), covered Cohorts 3 and 4 and was presented to the&#13;
Learning Board in November 2004. After discussing the evaluation, the Knowledge and&#13;
Learning Board (KLB) requested that World Bank Institute Evaluation Group (WBIEG)&#13;
carry out a second evaluation of the NMLP for subsequent cohorts. Both evaluations&#13;
address the same evaluation questions. The first evaluation is referred to as Phase I and&#13;
the second as Phase II. The Phase II evaluation focuses on Cohorts 8, 9, and 10 and uses&#13;
four evaluation approaches, three of which permit estimates of the impact of the NMLP:&#13;
&#13;
    · A level one evaluation for each of the three modules, answered by participants.&#13;
&#13;
    · A knowledge, behavior, and skills self-assessment tool completed by&#13;
         participants one week before and approximately twelve weeks after training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              vii&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     · Assessments from supervisors of participating managers before and after the&#13;
          training.&#13;
&#13;
     · Comparisons between trained and untrained new managers with respect to&#13;
          ratings given to them by their own staff on the "my managers" questions in the&#13;
          2005 Bank Group Staff Survey.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        KEY FINDINGS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Modules 2 and 3 are rated more positively than Module 1 by NMLP participants&#13;
&#13;
        This evaluation compares Modules 1, 2, and 3 across eight level 1 indicators:&#13;
(1) overall quality of training, (2) extent that the training fulfilled participants' learning&#13;
needs, (3) extent that the training achieved stated objectives, (4) extent that the training&#13;
was useful and applicable to participants on their jobs, (5) effectiveness in helping&#13;
participants learn from other managers, (6) quality and relevance of the training content,&#13;
(7) quality and relevance of materials used, and (8) quality and relevance of course&#13;
delivery method.&#13;
&#13;
        As in the case of the Phase I evaluation, Modules 2 and 3 were rated higher than&#13;
Module 1. For six of the eight selected indicators: "overall quality of training,"&#13;
"fulfilling learning needs," "achieving stated objectives," "quality and relevance of&#13;
content," "quality and relevance of materials used," and "quality and relevance of course&#13;
delivery method," the ratings for Module 1 were significantly lower than those for&#13;
Modules 2 and 3.&#13;
&#13;
        Module 3 was rated highest in "quality and relevance of materials" and Module 2&#13;
in "effectiveness of this module in helping you learn from other managers." There was&#13;
no statistical difference among the three modules for ratings of "usefulness and job&#13;
applicability" for which all three modules received high average ratings of 4.1 and above.&#13;
&#13;
        Module 2 ranked first for pacing of topics, Module 3 second and Module 1 last.&#13;
Ten percent of the respondents rated the pacing of Module 2 as "too slow," 74 percent&#13;
rated the pacing as "adequate," and sixteen percent rated it as "too fast."&#13;
&#13;
        Although Module 1 was revised after Phase I recommendations, participants'&#13;
ratings of this revised module remain similar to those before the revision.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Results of pre- and post self-evaluations by participants are favorable&#13;
&#13;
        To measure program impact, participants were asked to rate the extent to which&#13;
they are aware of or use 14 "preferred" management knowledge, skills and behaviors&#13;
addressed by the NMLP. The results were extremely favorable. After completing&#13;
NMLP, participants' self-ratings were higher for 9 of the 14 areas, as compared with their&#13;
self-ratings before attending NMLP. Statistically, the improvements (differences in&#13;
means) were significant at a .05 (or better) significance level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              viii&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        The program was especially successful in three areas rated lowest in the pre-&#13;
NMLP survey. All three areas benefited from a more than 30 percent increase in ratings&#13;
of 4 or 5 after program completion. The three areas of exceptional improvement were&#13;
"understand the impact you have on others" (43 percentage point increase in high&#13;
ratings), "practice creating a clear vision of what you want to accomplish as a leader" (40&#13;
percentage points increase in high ratings) and "understand the institution's expectations&#13;
of you as manager" (37 percentage point increase in higher ratings.)&#13;
&#13;
        In addition to a pre- and post self-assessment of management skills and behaviors,&#13;
participants were asked to rate the extent to which they believed NMLP made a&#13;
difference in improving their skills in target areas pre-identified by NMLP as "key target&#13;
areas of management improvement." The NMLP had the most impact, according to the&#13;
participants, in two areas - "communicating tough issues with my staff" and "improving&#13;
teamwork in my unit" - where almost one-half (49 and 45 percent, respectively) reported&#13;
that the program made "a lot of difference" in improving their skills in these areas. The&#13;
program had the least effect on "managing stress when making tough choices" and&#13;
"encouraging my staff to attend learning events," where almost one-fifth (17 and 19&#13;
percent, respectively) indicated that NMLP made "no difference."&#13;
&#13;
        To identify and measure potential factors that facilitate or hinder the new&#13;
managers' ability to practice NMLP management skills, participants were asked about the&#13;
extent to which a list of pre-identified facilitators and barriers could potentially influence&#13;
their ability to use the new management skills. By far the most important facilitating&#13;
factor was "personal commitment" to applying the new management skills. Participants&#13;
identified a "heavy volume of day-to-day work" as the greatest obstacle to put in practice&#13;
new knowledge after the NMLP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Supervisors' assessments indicate improvements in some managerial skills&#13;
&#13;
        Eighteen of 24 of interviewed supervisors indicated that they had noticed changes&#13;
in the managerial skills and behaviors of their NMLP staff four months after the program.&#13;
They reported that the participants made less frequent requests for advice, exhibited&#13;
stronger leadership, utilized more effective problem-solving mechanisms, and that their&#13;
team management had improved. Supervisors also identified several general outcomes as&#13;
well as a few specific management skills that they expected each participant to achieve&#13;
from the NMLP. In interviews conducted after managers completed the program,&#13;
supervisors reported that NMLP participants had, on average, achieved 60 percent of the&#13;
predetermined outcomes and 46 percent of predetermined management skills to a "great&#13;
or considerable extent."&#13;
&#13;
        Fifteen of 24 interviewed supervisors responded "yes" to the following broad&#13;
question: "Has the NMLP contributed to the performance of your staff in their new&#13;
managerial position?" Overall, they indicated that NMLP is (a) worth the sacrifice of&#13;
having the manager away for three weeks, and (b) important for new managers because it&#13;
helps them "settle in their position" and exposes them to a "network of colleagues" that&#13;
they would have otherwise not known.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               ix&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Survey results shows no difference between trained and untrained managerial&#13;
cohorts.&#13;
&#13;
        Comparisons between NMLP cohorts 7 and 8, which had completed the program&#13;
before the 2005 Bank Group Staff Survey, and cohorts 9 and 10, which completed the&#13;
program later, revealed only one difference in staff ratings of their managers. The only&#13;
Staff Survey item that showed a statistically significant improvement in ratings was "My&#13;
manager provides me with timely feedback to enhance my performance." Staff ratings of&#13;
their managers on other four questions about "my manager" showed no differences&#13;
between staff of managers in cohorts 7 and 8, and those of managers in cohorts 9 and 10.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
&#13;
        Four months after the course, participants and their supervisors offered&#13;
recommendations on means to improve the NMLP's usefulness and impact. The authors&#13;
agree with and endorse these recommendations.&#13;
&#13;
        Improve the quality and reduce the duration of Module 1. Module 1 was&#13;
rated lower than Modules 2 and 3 in six out of eight dimensions. Fourteen respondents&#13;
suggested that the module be changed significantly in design, content, and delivery.&#13;
Several participants noted that the session was "too slow," "boring," "too generic," and&#13;
"a superficial recycling of other Bank courses." Suggestions to make module 1 more&#13;
effective included cutting its duration, and adding more coaching, people management&#13;
exercises, and resource management skills.&#13;
&#13;
        Align NMLP with the day-to-day management issues of the Bank and tailor&#13;
the program to Bank needs: NMLP participants and their supervisors highlighted the&#13;
need for aligning NMLP to the Bank's work. To increase alignment, NMLP participants&#13;
made two suggestions: (a) allocate more time to "real world/actual" Bank/IFC case&#13;
studies that cover HR management, change management, and resource management; and&#13;
(b) develop action plans that enable participants to practice and apply NMLP skills.&#13;
&#13;
        Design refresher courses: Participants noted that refresher courses would&#13;
"provide a systematic process for course follow-up." Some suggested combining a&#13;
refresher course with one-on-one coaching, and others said that follow-up courses would&#13;
help the new managers to assess their own progress and address the skills that take longer&#13;
to put into day-to-day practice. The opinion of one supervisor summarizes this&#13;
recommendation: "The current NMLP provides a good base, but it needs continuation&#13;
and further deepening." A follow-up course would also keep the support network in&#13;
operation for the new managers.&#13;
&#13;
        Ensure timely course delivery to new incoming managers: Supervising&#13;
managers would like the program to be available early in the manager's career.&#13;
"Consider timing the program's delivery to take place within the first six months after a&#13;
new manager is assigned to his/her new position," suggested one supervisor.&#13;
&#13;
        Strengthen NMLP in three specific areas: Supervising managers also indicated&#13;
that NMLP could be even more effective than it has been to date if it would emphasize&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              x&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the three topics that continue to be challenging issues in the Bank environment --&#13;
cultural diversity, conflict management (including delivering hard news), and resource&#13;
management. Improving resource management was also recommended in Phase I of this&#13;
evaluation.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
1.1     This is the second evaluation of the New Managers' Leadership Program&#13;
(NMLP), a program sponsored by the Human Resources Services Leadership and&#13;
Organization unit (HRSLO). The first evaluation, Evaluation of New Managers'&#13;
Leadership Program (Zia, Hanson, and Gunnarson 2004), was presented to the Learning&#13;
Board in November 2004. After discussing the evaluation, the Learning Board requested&#13;
that WBIEG carry out a second evaluation of the NMLP. The two evaluations address&#13;
the same questions at different points in time; hence the first evaluation is referred to as&#13;
Phase I and the second as Phase II.1&#13;
&#13;
1.2     This chapter describes the New Manager's Leadership Program, lists the&#13;
evaluation objectives, presents the evaluation questions, and describes the evaluation&#13;
methodology used to assess program impact.&#13;

                                      COURSE DESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
1.3     The NMLP, which is based on feedback from senior Bank Group management,&#13;
human resource managers, coaches, and other Bank professionals, was developed to&#13;
support newly appointed and recruited managers with the aim to:2&#13;
&#13;
     · Clarify the institution's expectations of managers and strengthen managers'&#13;
         capabilities to deliver results through effective core relationship skills;&#13;
&#13;
     · Increase managers' capabilities to create the results they want in ways that&#13;
         support life balance; and&#13;
&#13;
     · Build knowledge and skills in leading change at their unit level and provide&#13;
         opportunities to apply their new knowledge to work situations as they continue&#13;
         to build the cohort as learning and support community.&#13;
&#13;
1.4     The NMLP covers these elements through three sequential four- to five-day&#13;
modules over a seven- to eight-month period. Each group of new managers completes all&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
three modules with the same group, a managerial cohort.3 As of the date of this&#13;
evaluation, 10 cohorts have completed the NMLP. The three course modules are:4&#13;
&#13;
     · Module 1 ­ Crafting Your Management Role provides insights on the skill of&#13;
           relationship management by exploring the Bank's work environment,&#13;
           participants' influencing skills, interpersonal communication skills, and cultural&#13;
           competencies. This module was modified in early 2005 as a result of WBIEG's&#13;
           recommendations in November 2004.5&#13;
&#13;
     · Module 2 ­ Achieving Business Results through Personal Mastery focuses&#13;
           on building self-awareness and understanding as a foundation for personal&#13;
           management and managing others. Participants are expected to strengthen their&#13;
           ability to face new managerial challenges by gaining clarity about personal&#13;
           vision, aligning their personal values with professional demands, building&#13;
           interpersonal competence and confidence, and accepting responsibility for&#13;
           outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
     · Module 3 ­ Leading Change mobilizes managers to lead change in the&#13;
           complex World Bank Group. Participants are expected to apply the concepts&#13;
           presented in this module to their issues. Those issues are related to leading&#13;
           strategically in a decentralized environment, both within the Bank Group's&#13;
           leadership team and in their units.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               OBJECTIVES, APPROACH, AND METHODOLOGY OF EVALUATION&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Evaluation objectives&#13;
&#13;
1.5      The overall objectives and research questions of this Phase II evaluation remain&#13;
the same as those for Phase I: to determine whether NMLP has achieved its mandate "to&#13;
facilitate new managers' success by providing them with foundational knowledge and&#13;
skills as steps toward becoming world class managers." The evaluation seeks to&#13;
understand the usefulness of NMLP from the perspective of the participants as well as&#13;
their supervisors. To achieve these objectives, this evaluation:&#13;
&#13;
     · Assessed NMLP's success in reaching its goals;&#13;
&#13;
     · Assessed the program's usefulness and gauged the extent to which managers&#13;
           applied the knowledge and skills gained from the program to their day-to-day&#13;
           work;&#13;
&#13;
3.  In a few instances participants had to transfer to a future cohort to complete subsequent modules (due&#13;
to unplanned business or time conflicts).&#13;
4.  Source: http://intranet.worldbank.org/WBSITE/INTRANET/UNITS/HR/LOE.&#13;
5.  The initial objectives of Module 1 were to craft the management role by aligning strategies with the&#13;
Bank's mission and achieving results through effective resource management. The Phase I evaluation&#13;
report (Zia, Hanson, and Gunnarson 2004) recommended that "[HRSLO] revisit Module 1 to make&#13;
considerable changes or to drop it." The NMLP team decided to make changes that were reflected in the&#13;
program offered to cohorts 8, 9, and 10.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     · Assessed the improvement of Module 1; and&#13;
&#13;
     · Provided recommendations for continuous improvement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Approach and methodology&#13;
&#13;
1.6      The Phase II evaluation focuses on cohorts 8, 9, and 10.6 Building on the Phase I&#13;
results and methodology, the Phase II uses an approach that includes four components:7&#13;
&#13;
     · Component 1 assesses the perceived quality of each of the three modules and&#13;
           identifies participants' perceptions of each module immediately after its&#13;
           completion with a level 1 evaluation for all three cohorts.&#13;
&#13;
     · Component 2 assesses impact based on a comparison of posttraining self-&#13;
           assessments from participants in cohorts 9 and 10 and a pretraining self-&#13;
           assessment of those who participated in cohorts 9 and 10.8&#13;
&#13;
     · Component 3 gathers assessments from supervisors of participating managers.&#13;
           Supervisors of participants in cohorts 9 and 10 were interviewed twice -- one&#13;
           month before the training to determine areas of desired improvement and four&#13;
           months after the training to discuss the extent of changes in the participants'&#13;
           managerial skills.9&#13;
&#13;
     · Component 4 assesses impact based on the "my managers" questions in the&#13;
           Bank's 2005 staff survey comparing the ratings between NMLP cohorts 7 and 8,&#13;
           which had completed the program before the 2005 Bank Group Staff Survey,&#13;
           and cohorts 9 and 10, which completed the program later.10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6.  Cohort 8 began on February 14, 2005, cohort 9 began on October 17, 2005, and cohort 10 began on&#13;
January 23, 2006. Each cohort had approximately 30 participants. All participants in the NMLP were&#13;
expected to attend within six months of assuming their new managerial position.&#13;
7.  The concept note lists five components. The fifth component -- an assessment of participants'&#13;
implementation of action plans -- was dropped because the participants were not given action plans as&#13;
originally envisioned.&#13;
8.  In addition, post training assessments were gathered from cohort 8, but pre-training assessments were&#13;
not available, as cohort 8 began in Module 1 in mid-February, just when the Knowledge and Learning&#13;
Board asked WBIEG for this evaluation and too late for pretraining assessments. The prospective&#13;
participants for cohorts 9 and 10 were not a "control" for longer than a month after launching their survey.&#13;
WBIEG administered the survey to each cohort one month before the start of Module 1.&#13;
9.  This component was added after cohort 8 completed the program, thus precluding the opportunity to&#13;
interview cohort 8 participants' supervisors in advance.&#13;
10. Although this study is based on cohorts 8, 9, and 10, we included cohort 7 to maintain a balance&#13;
between data from control and from treatment groups. Ideally, the study would control for several&#13;
variables, including number of years since participation in NMLP, number of years with the Bank, and&#13;
number of months in position. The study would also compare externally recruited managers with internally&#13;
promoted managers. In compliance with the HR policy against providing data about individuals, however,&#13;
we do not have access to such control variables.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.7     In reporting the results of all comparisons made in each of the aforementioned&#13;
components, we report only differences that are significant at a .05 level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Evaluation instruments&#13;
&#13;
1.8     This evaluation used three types of instruments: Questionnaires administered&#13;
immediately after completion of every module, surveys administered before the start and&#13;
after the completion of the program, and interviews conducted before and after the&#13;
program.&#13;
&#13;
1.9     For Phase II, WBIEG constructed a revised customized level 1 questionnaire for&#13;
the newly designed Module 1, and used the same customized level 1 questionnaire for&#13;
Modules 2 and 3 as those used in Phase I. The survey instruments comprise (a) a pre-&#13;
self-assessment instrument for prospective participants, (b) a post self-assessment&#13;
instrument for graduates of the program, and (c) extracted questions from the 2005 Bank&#13;
Group Staff Survey.&#13;
&#13;
1.10    The pre-assessment survey was a short (14-item) instrument that was repeated in&#13;
the post-assessment. It allowed participants to rate their management knowledge, skills&#13;
and behaviors on 14 areas specified by HRSLO. It was completed just before&#13;
participating in the NMLP.&#13;
&#13;
1.11    In contrast to the pre-assessment survey, the post-assessment instrument was an&#13;
extensive questionnaire (closed- and open-ended questions) that measured indicators on&#13;
two levels: Management skills and behaviors of participants and the usefulness of the&#13;
program. The post-assessment instrument covered:&#13;
&#13;
     · Self-assessment of 14 key management skills and behaviors pre-identified by&#13;
          HRSLO (identical to the pre-assessment survey items);&#13;
&#13;
     · Extent of participant use of and benefit from newly acquired knowledge and&#13;
          skills;&#13;
&#13;
     · Degree to which the participants believed that the program made a difference in&#13;
          specific management areas (e.g., communicating tough issues, improving&#13;
          teamwork, leading change, etc.);&#13;
&#13;
     · Comparison of NMLP with other management training;&#13;
&#13;
     · Facilitators of and barriers to participants' use of behavioral knowledge and&#13;
          skills; and,&#13;
&#13;
     · Recommendations for improvement.&#13;
&#13;
1.12    The interview instruments included questions asked of supervisors of NMLP&#13;
participants one month before and three to nine months after the new managers&#13;
completed the program. The first interview asked supervisors to identify performance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
areas where they hoped their managers would improve, and the second interview asked&#13;
supervisors whether the program improved the performance of participants.&#13;
&#13;
1.13     Sources of data for all graphs and tables, with the exception staff survey data&#13;
(presented in Chapter 4), are participant surveys and supervisor interviews.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Evaluation questions&#13;
&#13;
1.14     The evaluation sought to identify and measure the program's impact on&#13;
participants and addressed the following questions:&#13;
&#13;
     · Did the training fulfil the participants' learning needs?&#13;
&#13;
     · Did it achieve its stated objectives?&#13;
&#13;
     · Were the modules' content, activities, and materials of high quality and relevant&#13;
          to the needs of the participants?&#13;
&#13;
     · Did the participants use the behavioral knowledge and skills presented in the&#13;
          program?&#13;
&#13;
     · Did the participants' performance and behaviors improve after attending the&#13;
          NMLP?&#13;
&#13;
     · What were the facilitators of and barriers to participants' use of behavioral&#13;
          knowledge and skills?&#13;
&#13;
     · Did the NMLP participants perform better than others who did not attend the&#13;
          program?&#13;
&#13;
     · How can the program be improved to address better the learning needs of new&#13;
          managers?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Target population and response rates&#13;
&#13;
1.15     For the Phase II study, WBIEG studied cohorts 8, 9, and 10 just before the&#13;
training, during the training (level 1 evaluations at the end of every module), and four&#13;
months after completion of the last module.11 Cohorts 8, 9, and 10 included 90&#13;
participants --cohort 8 had 27 participants, cohort 9 had 28, and cohort 10 had 35&#13;
participants.12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
11. Cohort 8 participants could not be studied just before the training because they began their training on&#13;
February 14, 2005, and WBIEG and KLB finalized their agreement on the methodology of the Phase II&#13;
evaluation in April 2005.&#13;
12. The number of observations (Ns) reported in the level 1 analysis reflects 11 cases where participants&#13;
transferred to a future cohort to complete Module 2 and/or Module 3 due to unplanned business or personal&#13;
time conflicts. It is possible, therefore, for a participant to have started in cohort 7 for module 1 and&#13;
transferred to cohort 8 for module 2, and graduated in cohort 9. Because of the anonymity of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.16     Of the 90 graduates of NMLP in cohorts 8, 9, and 10, 65 percent were from&#13;
IBRD, 33 percent were from IFC, and 1 percent was from MIGA. Eighty-three percent&#13;
were promoted from within the Bank, 10 percent were new externally recruited&#13;
managers, and 7 percent were existing managers. Twenty-nine percent were female.&#13;
&#13;
1.17     The average response rate for level 1 evaluations of Modules 1, 2, and 3 across all&#13;
cohorts was 93 percent. Response rates for the pre- and post self-assessment&#13;
questionnaires were lower at 78 percent in advance of training and 79 percent after&#13;
training.13 Response rates for the interviews with supervisors were 100 percent pre-&#13;
NMLP and 91 percent post-NMLP.14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
questionnaires, we base our level 1 findings on all questionnaires completed by respondents at the end of&#13;
each module, whether or not they ultimately transferred to another cohort. Such reporting, though&#13;
comprehensive, presents slight disparities between number of graduates from every cohort and the&#13;
corresponding level 1 "Ns" for every module.&#13;
13. The pre-assessment response rate was 96 percent for cohort 9 and 60 percent for cohort 10. Pre-&#13;
assessment questionnaires were administered by HRSLO on the first day of Module 1. Fourteen of 35&#13;
participants in cohort 10 did not complete the pre-assessment questionnaires. See appendix 4 for number&#13;
and rates of pre and postresponses to self-assessment surveys.&#13;
14. Response rates for post interviews with managers are based on the number of "eligible" supervisors&#13;
(supervisors who were managers of NMLP participants from program start through six months after&#13;
program completion). For cohorts 9 and 10, 22 managers were eligible. Twenty of the 22 managers were&#13;
available for interviews. Four of the 20 supervisors interviewed each had two participants in the program,&#13;
making the number of questionnaires 24.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 2. EARLY EVALUATION RESULTS: MANAGERS' VIEW&#13;
&#13;
2.1       To assess the quality, relevance, and effectiveness of the course, cohorts 8, 9, and&#13;
10 completed level 1 evaluations at the end of each module.15 This chapter provides an&#13;
overview of each module and reports the results of the level 1 evaluations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          MODULE 1: CRAFTING YOUR MANAGEMENT ROLE -- LEVEL 1 FINDINGS&#13;
&#13;
2.2       Module 1 aims to provide insights about the skill of relationship management by&#13;
exploring the Bank's work environment, the participants' influencing skills, interpersonal&#13;
communication skills, and cultural competencies. As a result of recommendations of&#13;
Phase I evaluation, the emphasis of Module 1 in Phase II shifted from resource&#13;
management related topics to interpersonal development and influencing skills. The&#13;
module covers how managers should fulfill their Bank managerial accountabilities,&#13;
inspire trust, and manage complexities and priorities.16&#13;
&#13;
2.3       The findings of the level 1 survey reflect the views of NMLP participants&#13;
immediately after completing the first module. Participants scored each survey item on a&#13;
5-point scale (1=low to 5=high/preferred behavior). Despite the changes made to the&#13;
content and delivery of Module 1, participants' ratings of the revised module remain&#13;
similar to those before the revision.17 Four of the module 1 indicators show a slight&#13;
improvement (from 4 to 8 percent more of the participants in Phase II rate Module 1&#13;
higher than participants in Phase I rated Module 1), while ratings on two of the indicators&#13;
show a slight decline.18&#13;
&#13;
2.4       The highest ratings are found in the "usefulness and applicability of knowledge&#13;
and skills acquired from the module," with 84 percent of the respondents giving ratings&#13;
of 4 or 5. About three-fourths (76 percent) of the respondents gave 4 or 5 ratings for&#13;
"ability to achieve its announced objectives," while 70 percent gave ratings of 4 or 5 on&#13;
the "effectiveness of the module in helping them learn from other managers" and on the&#13;
"overall quality of the module." Only 58 percent indicated that the training in Module 1&#13;
fulfilled their learning with a 4 or 5 rating, and 10 percent gave ratings of 1 or 2. With&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
15. Appendices 2a-c provide level 1 questionnaires for Modules 1, 2, and 3.&#13;
16. Module 1 of Phase II differs from that of Module I in Phase I.&#13;
17. It is not possible to test for significant differences in mean ratings, due to lack of data from the Phase I&#13;
evaluation regarding the number of cases and the standard deviations in the ratings.&#13;
18. Indicators with positive change are: "Extent module achieves its stated objectives", "quality and&#13;
relevance of contents of Module," "extent the module fulfills learning needs," and "overall quality of&#13;
module." Two indicators with lower ratings in Phase II than I are: "Quality and relevance of materials&#13;
used" and "quality and relevance of method of delivery."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the exception of "applicability of knowledge and skills acquired" within the module&#13;
(mean score 4.17), scores were significantly below the Bank's average level 1 scores.&#13;

2.5        The overall quality of the training in Module 1 was rated 4 or 5 by 70 percent of&#13;
the participants, whereas Module 2 was rated 4 or 5 by 84 percent and Module 3, by 89&#13;
percent.&#13;
2.6        The quality and relevance of the content, materials, and delivery methods used&#13;
were not highly rated (figure 2). Although two of the three ratings were above the mid-&#13;
point, neither exceeded 4 and must therefore be considered average. Cohort 10 rated&#13;
materials particularly poorly with only 30 percent giving them a 4 or 5. Cohort 10 gave&#13;
fewer favorable ratings on all three items (by 10 to 15 percentage points) than did cohorts&#13;
8 and 9.&#13;

2.7      On average, 28 percent of the participants found Module 1 to be too slow, 56&#13;
percent found the pace adequate, and the remaining 8 percent said it was too fast (Figure&#13;
3). Almost one-half of cohort 10 (43 percent) found the module to be too slow.&#13;
&#13;
2.8      Qualitative data collected for both level 1 and impact surveys (four months after&#13;
program completion) suggest that participants' low ratings of this module could be partly&#13;
attributed to the slow pace of the module. Several managers stated that "there was too&#13;
much slack time," "[the module was] not paced fast enough" or "it could be done in three&#13;
days." Several participants noted that the plenary sessions were "too long" and "boring."&#13;

2.9      In addition to standard level 1 items such as quality, relevance, and pace,&#13;
participants were asked to rate the effectiveness of the particular focus areas addressed in&#13;
each module (figure 4). There was a wide variation in ratings of focus areas -- from a&#13;
mean of 4.19 for "listening and inquiry skills" to 2.77 for "HR practices and WBG&#13;
resources."19&#13;
&#13;
2.10     Module 1 participants gave high ratings to only two of the seven themes, or focus&#13;
areas -- "your current level of listening and inquiry skills" (84 percent 4 or 5) and "your&#13;
current level of advocacy/feedback skills" (79 percent 4 or 5) (figure 4). The module was&#13;
not at all successful in addressing human resource policy and practice issues at the Bank.&#13;
The mean score for this item was 2.77.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
19. Note that "behaviors that inspire trust in others" was an evaluation item only for cohorts 9 and 10 (and&#13;
not for 8 because the unit on "inspiring trust" was not fully developed and implemented until cohort 9.&#13;

                  MODULE 2: ACHIEVING BUSINESS RESULTS -- LEVEL 1 FINDINGS&#13;
&#13;
2.11       The second module focused on helping managers (a) gain clarity about personal&#13;
vision, (b) align personal values with professional demands, (c) build interpersonal&#13;
competence and confidence, and (d) accept responsibility for outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
2.12       Findings from level 1 survey reveal that Module 2 was more highly regarded by&#13;
participants than was Module 1 in every aspect except usefulness and applicability of&#13;
knowledge and skills which received equally high ratings across all three modules&#13;
(Module 2 ratings shown in figure 5).&#13;

2.15        The majority of cohorts 8 and 9 (83 percent and 84 percent, respectively) found&#13;
Module 2 to be adequately paced (figure 7). Opinions of cohort 10 participants on pacing&#13;
varied -- 18 percent thought it was too slow, 21 percent thought it was too fast, and 61&#13;
percent reported it as adequate.&#13;

2.16      Compared to Module 1, Module 2 rated higher in terms of effectiveness in the&#13;
area of focus (figure 8 shows participant ratings of the six focus areas for Module 2).&#13;
Approximately three-quarters or more of the managers considered the training to be&#13;
effective in the areas covered. The module was most effective at increasing new&#13;
managers' awareness of their "impact on others" (mean of 4.12) and "what enhances&#13;
interpersonal effectiveness" (mean of 4.00).&#13;

                           MODULE 3: LEADING CHANGE -- LEVEL 1 FINDINGS&#13;
&#13;
2.17      Cohorts 9 and 10 completed the program simultaneously as they both attended the&#13;
same session for Module 3. The third and final module of the NMLP was designed to&#13;
help managers (a) become strategic leaders in a complex and decentralized environment,&#13;
(b) institute change as part of the Bank's leadership team and in their units, and (c)&#13;
accelerate learning and innovation in their units.&#13;
&#13;
2.18      Module 3 results (figure 9) are similar to those from Module 2 in overall quality&#13;
of training, fulfilling learning needs, achieving stated objectives, usefulness and job&#13;
applicability, quality and relevance of training content, and course delivery. Module 3&#13;
outperformed Module 2 on the quality and relevance of the materials used, with 88&#13;
percent of the respondents giving a rating of 4 or 5 (figure 10).&#13;

2.19       The pacing of Module 3 was adequate for most participants although there were&#13;
differences between cohorts (figure 11). The majority of participants (79 percent of&#13;
cohort 8 and 66 percent of cohorts 9 and 10) found Module 3 to be adequately paced,&#13;
while 26 percent of participants from cohorts 9 and 10 rated Module 3 as too fast.&#13;

"achieving stated objectives," "quality and relevance of content," "quality and relevance&#13;
of materials used," and "quality and relevance of course delivery method." Module 3&#13;
was rated highest in "quality and relevance of materials." There was no statistical&#13;
difference between the three modules for "usefulness and job applicability of knowledge&#13;
and skills" for which all three modules received high average ratings of 4.1 and above.&#13;
&#13;
Module 2 ranked first for pacing of topics, Module 3 second, and Module 1 last. Ten&#13;
percent of the respondents rated the pacing of Module 2 as "too slow," 74 percent rated&#13;

21. Module 1 was also rated the lowest of the three modules in Phase I evaluation. A statistical test of&#13;
difference between Module 1 in Phase I evaluation (cohorts 3 and 4) and Phase II (cohorts 8, 9, and 10)&#13;
would have been desirable, but was not possible for two reasons: first, the instrument for module 1 has&#13;
changed since Phase I, and second, for those items that are the same, standard errors of Phase I indicators&#13;
are not available.&#13;

                   3. IMPACT EVALUATION RESULTS:&#13;
              SELF-ASSESSMENTS BY PARTICIPANTS&#13;
                           BEFORE AND AFTER NMLP&#13;
&#13;
3.1      This chapter addresses four questions:        22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      · Did the participants utilize the behavioral knowledge and skills presented in the&#13;
           program?&#13;
&#13;
      · Did the participants' performance and behaviors improve after attending the&#13;
           NMLP?&#13;
&#13;
      · What were the facilitators of and barriers to the participants' utilization of&#13;
           behavioral knowledge and skills?&#13;
&#13;
      · How can the program be improved to better address the learning needs of new&#13;
           managers?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             DID THE PARTICIPANTS USE THEIR NEW KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS?&#13;
&#13;
3.2      We gauge the use of management skills acquired in the NMLP in three ways:&#13;
(a) managers' self-assessment of the degree to which they were able to use their newly&#13;
acquired skills, (b) managers' rating of the extent to which they benefited from the&#13;
program, and (c) managers' self report of receiving favorable feedback after attending the&#13;
course.&#13;
&#13;
3.3      In response to the question "Since your participation in NMLP, to what extent&#13;
have you been able to use the various skills and approaches you learned?" All&#13;
respondents reported that they had been able to make use of NMLP training "to some&#13;
extent," and about one-half (47 percent) said they had applied the training "to a&#13;
considerable extent."&#13;
&#13;
3.4      In response to the question "Overall, to what extent have you benefited from&#13;
NMLP?" only two (of 72) respondents reported benefiting "to a limited extent" or "not at&#13;
all." Twenty-four percent of the participants reported that they benefited from the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
22. This chapter is based on responses from 48 managers from pre-NMLP surveys (78 percent response&#13;
rate) and 72 managers who responded to post-NMLP survey (80 percent response rate). Also, as&#13;
mentioned earlier, our sample of observations for the pre-NMLP survey excluded cohort 8 because the&#13;
report was requested after cohort 8 began, hence the smaller number of responses relative to the post survey&#13;
responses. See appendix 3a and 3b for pre- and post survey instruments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    17&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
program "to a great extent," 54 percent to a "considerable extent," and 19 percent "to&#13;
some extent."&#13;
&#13;
3.5      More than two-thirds of the participants (71 percent) reported receiving favorable&#13;
feedback on their management abilities since attending NMLP. The remaining 29&#13;
percent did not receive any feedback at all.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          DID THE PARTICIPANTS NOTE A CHANGE IN THEIR OWN PERFORMANCE?&#13;
&#13;
3.6      Improvement in participants' performance and behaviors was examined in two&#13;
ways: Through pre- and post self-assessment of the management skills and through post&#13;
assessment of the extent to which their participation made a difference in improving their&#13;
management skills.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Participant self-assessments of performance, before and after NMLP&#13;
&#13;
3.7      The data for this analysis are based on responses from participants of cohorts 9&#13;
and 10 at the start of the program and four months after the program.23 Both surveys&#13;
were anonymous and confidential, and it is not possible to match the pre- and post&#13;
responses on an individual basis. A total of 48 participants completed the pre-assessment&#13;
and 49 participants completed the post-assessment for cohorts 9 and 10 (see appendix 4&#13;
for details on the response rates).&#13;
&#13;
3.8      To measure program impact, participants were asked to rate the extent to which&#13;
they used the 14 preferred management skills and behaviors addressed by the NMLP.&#13;
The ratings were based on a 5-point scale broken down into these categories: "to a great&#13;
extent" (5), "to a considerable extent" (4), "to some extent" (3), "to a limited extent" (2),&#13;
and "not at all" (1). Figure 13 presents the share of participants rating themselves in the&#13;
highest two categories, before and after the NMLP.&#13;
&#13;
3.9      In 9 of the 14 areas, a higher share of participants rated themselves in categories 4&#13;
and 5 following the NMLP than prior to the NMLP.24 Differences in mean ratings of&#13;
pre- and post-NMLP mirror the results of change in 4 or 5 ratings -- in 9 of the 14 areas,&#13;
managers' self-ratings were 8 to 22 percent higher than they were before attending&#13;
NMLP.25 Significance tests for the improvements shown in figure 13 are reported in&#13;
Table 3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
23. See appendices 3a and 3b for the pre- and post questionnaires. Also, in the absence of preprogram data&#13;
for cohort 8 we base this analysis on cohorts 9 and 10 only.&#13;
24. One of the areas shows a small negative shift and another two show a positive shift of less than 5&#13;
percent on the mean ratings (see table 3.) As shown in table 3, changes in all three areas are statistically&#13;
insignificant.&#13;
25. Percentage of improvement in each area was calculated with a simple percentage change formula of:&#13;
(post mean rating ­ pre mean rating)/pre-mean rating * 100.&#13;

3.10     The program was successful in the three lowest rated areas in the pre-NMLP. All&#13;
three areas benefited from an increase of over 30 percentage point in ratings of 4 or 5&#13;
after program completion. The three areas of exceptional improvement were "understand&#13;
the impact you have on others" (47 percentage point increase in 4 or 5 ratings), "practice&#13;
creating a clear vision of what you want to accomplish as a leader" (41 percentage point&#13;
increase in 4 or 5 ratings), and "understand the institution's expectations of you as&#13;
manager" (31 percentage point increase in 4 or 5 ratings).&#13;
&#13;
3.11     Although participants benefited from a significant increase in ratings in the&#13;
aforementioned areas, their post ratings suggest that there is also room for further&#13;
improvement ­ since in the two areas of "practice creating a clear vision of what you&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                19&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

manager" - where post ratings of 4 or 5 remain less than 80 percent.&#13;

3.12      The five areas without significant changes in ratings were "employ listening and&#13;
inquiry skills," "align the structure and processes of your team with the mission of the&#13;
organization," "understand what behaviors inspire trust--or, conversely, undermine&#13;
trust--in leaders," "develop effective changes within the team to address organizational&#13;
changes," and "understand the importance of creating partnerships to achieve results." T-&#13;
tests of the mean difference between the ratings before and after NMLP show that there is&#13;
no statistically significant difference in managers' knowledge and skills in these five&#13;
areas before and after NMLP. The difference between before and after is only a small&#13;
fraction of the standard deviation of the pre-scores presented in table 3.&#13;
&#13;

Extent to which NMLP made a difference&#13;
&#13;
3.13     In addition to a pre-and post self-assessment of management skills and behavior,&#13;
participants were asked to rate the extent to which they believed NMLP made a&#13;
difference in improving their skills in target areas pre-identified by NMLP as "key focus&#13;
areas of management improvement." Figure 14 lists the six areas of management skills&#13;
that NMLP aimed to improve and the distribution of ratings for each area. Participants&#13;
estimated the effects of the NMLP in three categories: A lot of difference, a slight&#13;
difference, and no difference.26&#13;
&#13;
3.14     Of the 6 pre-identified target areas of management improvement (listed in Figure&#13;
14), the NMLP has made the most difference in "communicating tough issues." Though&#13;
rated highest relative to the other pre-identified target areas, only one-half (49%) of the&#13;
participants rated the program as making "a lot of difference" in this area. In another pre-&#13;
identified communication related area, "resolving differences among staff and with&#13;
stakeholders," only 35 percent of the participants rated it as making "a lot of difference."&#13;
These findings suggest that there is still room for improvement in the communication&#13;
related areas of the program. About one-fifth of the respondents indicated that the NMLP&#13;
"made no difference" in "managing stress when making tough choices" (17%) and&#13;
"encouraging my staff to attend learning events" (19 %)."&#13;

3.15     Asked if the NMLP had led to managing in different and better ways, 96 percent&#13;
(65 of 68 respondents) responded yes, and 54 respondents explained how they manage in&#13;
different and better ways. Participants shared seven areas of improvement, listed below&#13;
in order of importance, from most frequently cited to least frequently cited:&#13;
&#13;

chose it for leading change in the Bank Group environment.&#13;

&#13;
3.16    Although our pre-post analyses show that there was no statistically significant&#13;
change in participants' self ratings of listening and inquiry skills (para. 3.12), ten of the&#13;
54 participants who responded how "NMLP led you to manage in different and better&#13;
ways" indicated that they have a better understanding of the importance of listening and&#13;
practicing it. Possible explanations for this distinction are that those ten participants who&#13;
noted their awareness in the importance of listening after the program, had over-rated&#13;
themselves before the program ­ when they were not yet aware of listening as a "skill"&#13;
per se; or that they under-rated themselves after the program. Another explanation could&#13;
be that three of the 10 who said that they had a better understanding of the importance of&#13;
listening skills belonged to cohort 8 which - due to lack of pre-course data - was not&#13;
included in the pre-post analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 WHAT ARE THE FACILITATORS AND BARRIERS FOR MANAGERS TO APPLY NEW SKILLS?&#13;
&#13;
3.17    To identify and measure potential factors that facilitate or hinder new managers'&#13;
ability to practice NMLP management skills, participants were asked about the extent to&#13;
which a list of pre-identified facilitators and barriers could potentially influence their&#13;
ability to use the new management skills.&#13;
&#13;
3.18     Five potential facilitators were identified: (a) staff readiness to accept change, (b)&#13;
personal commitment, (c) support from colleagues, (d) support from others who attended&#13;
NMLP, and (e) support from supervisors/managers. Respondents rated the extent to&#13;
which these factors served as facilitators for applying their new knowledge and skills on a&#13;
scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (to a great extent) (figure 15).&#13;
&#13;
3.19    By far the most important facilitating factor was "personal commitment" to&#13;
applying the new knowledge. The second most important facilitating factor identified by&#13;
the new managers was "support from their supervisors/managers" in implementing their&#13;
newly acquired skills.&#13;
&#13;
3.20    It is noteworthy that new managers did not consider support from their NMLP&#13;
peers as an impetus for putting NMLP skills into use. Although the program aspires to&#13;
create cohorts of peers to support each other after NMLP, it may well be that the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                22&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
participants do not have the time or occasion to maintain the support for one another after&#13;
completing the program.&#13;
&#13;
3.21      Three potential barriers to the use of newly acquired management skills were&#13;
identified (figure 16): (a) irrelevant content of NMLP, (b) abstract/too conceptual nature&#13;
of NMLP, and (c) heavy volume of day-to-day work. Respondents rated these barriers on&#13;
a scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (to a great extent).&#13;
&#13;
3.22      Participants identified a heavy volume of day-to-day work as the greatest barrier.&#13;
Forty-one percent of the respondents thought this was a great or considerable barrier. In&#13;
contrast, a small number had concerns about the applicability of the skills to their&#13;
particular job (6 percent), or felt the course was too abstract or conceptual to be&#13;
applicable (9 percent).&#13;

NMLP to other new managers, and 79 percent rated NMLP as "better than" or "one of&#13;
the best" management courses compared with other management training in which they&#13;
had participated (figure 17).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
3.24   Sixty of 72 respondents made comments and recommendations. They made&#13;
general comments about the usefulness of the modules and provided specific&#13;
recommendations for improving the overall program in terms of the curriculum, content,&#13;
and duration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Comments specific to the modules&#13;
&#13;
3.25   Module 1. Fourteen of 60 respondents indicated that Module 1 was the least&#13;
useful of the three modules. Three people described the module as too generic and&#13;
another said that it was "a superficial recycling of other Bank courses." All 14&#13;
respondents suggested that Module 1 be changed significantly in design, content, and&#13;
delivery, or it should be dropped. Suggestions to make it more useful included cutting its&#13;
duration, adding more coaching, people management exercises, and resource&#13;
management skills.&#13;
&#13;
3.26   Module 2. Participants gave mixed comments on Module 2. Five of the 10&#13;
participants who commented on this module thought it was useful. The remaining five&#13;
suggested that the module should be modified to include simulations to allow practice of&#13;
the theories and concepts covered in the module.&#13;
&#13;
3.27   Module 3. Participants' comments on Module 3 were by far more positive than&#13;
those for Modules 1 and 2. Of the 26 participants who commented on Module 3, 23&#13;
indicated that it was the most useful and most stimulating module. Almost without&#13;
exception, however, all 23 respondents cautioned that the module was perhaps too&#13;
academic and needed more emphasis on applying the theories and cases presented to the&#13;
WB/IFC situation. Respondents suggested adding Bank/IFC case studies and allocating&#13;
more time for analysis and discussion, and relating the cases to their personal experience.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Recommendations to improve NMLP&#13;
&#13;
3.28   Four months after the course, with time to reflect on and practice the course&#13;
content, participants offered two concrete recommendations to increase the usefulness&#13;
and impact of NMLP:&#13;
&#13;
     · Align NMLP with day-to-day management issues of the Bank. To increase&#13;
         alignment, they made two suggestions: (a) allocate more time to "real&#13;
         world/actual" Bank/IFC case studies that cover HR management, change&#13;
         management, and resource management; and (b) develop action plans that&#13;
         enable participants to practice and apply NMLP skills.&#13;
&#13;
     · Design follow-up refresher courses. Participants noted that refresher courses&#13;
         would provide a systematic process for follow up. Some suggested combining a&#13;
         refresher course with one-on-one coaching, and others said that follow-up&#13;
         courses would help new managers assess their own progress and address the&#13;
         skills that take longer to put into day-to-day practice.&#13;
&#13;
3.29   Participants made mixed recommendations about the duration of the course.&#13;
Some suggested that the course should be cut to two weeks and others said that it was&#13;

                                              25&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
"too fast." Asked to rate the duration of the course as too long, too short, or just right, 76&#13;
percent said that three weeks was just right, 16 percent said it was too long, and 6 percent&#13;
said it was too short.&#13;

                   4. IMPACT EVALUATION RESULTS:&#13;
    THIRD-PARTY ASSESSMENTS FROM SUPERVISORS&#13;
                                  AND STAFF SURVEYS&#13;
&#13;
4.1      This chapter further explores two of the same evaluation questions addressed in&#13;
Chapter 3 from the perspective of NMLP participants. In this chapter two evaluation&#13;
questions are addressed from the perspective of supervisors and direct&#13;
reports/subordinates of NMLP participants.&#13;
&#13;
      · Did the participants' performance and behaviors improve after attending the&#13;
           NMLP?&#13;
&#13;
      · How can the program be improved to better address the learning needs of new&#13;
           managers?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.2      The first part of this chapter presents the results of supervisors' assessments of the&#13;
NMLP based on their observed changes in behavioral and management skills of their&#13;
staff who were members of cohorts 9 and 10. The second part of the chapter presents&#13;
results from the 2005 Bank staff survey, comparing staff ratings for managers who had&#13;
completed the NMLP at the time of the staff survey with those who had not yet&#13;
participated in NMLP (but were about to do so).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   SUPERVISORS' ASSESSMENTS BEFORE AND AFTER NMLP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.3      This section analyses supervisors' opinions about whether the new managers in&#13;
cohort 9 and 10 achieved their objectives. It reports the supervisors' assessment of the&#13;
impact of NMLP on its participants, based on their observations of changes in the&#13;
performance of their new managers after attending the program. These assessments are&#13;
based on two sets of interviews with the supervisors -- once before their staff attended&#13;
NMLP and four months after they completed NMLP.27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.4      The data used for this analysis are based on pre- and post interviews with 20&#13;
supervisors who reported on 24 NMLP participants from cohorts 9 and 10.28 Four of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
27.  See appendices 5A and 5B for pre- and post-NMLP interview questions to the supervisors.&#13;
28.  The number of supervisors "eligible" for post interviews (23) was far less than those interviewed in the&#13;
pre-NMLP phase (47). This is because 17 supervisors and seven new managers had changed positions by&#13;
the time the post-NMLP interviews were conducted. Three of the eligible supervisors for post interviews&#13;
did not respond to requests for interviews.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    27&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
interviewees reported on two NMLP participants, each of which provided separate&#13;
interviews for each of their NMLP staff members.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.5     In the pre-NMLP interviews, the supervisors were asked to identify (a) three&#13;
developmental outcomes that they would like to see the participant achieve over the&#13;
course of the NMLP, and (b) a list of management skills that they thought the participant&#13;
should attain to deal with the challenges of his or her particular work environment. On&#13;
average, supervisors listed three development outcomes and two management skills that&#13;
they expected their new manager to achieve over the course of the training program.29 In&#13;
total, supervisors identified 63 development outcomes and 50 management skills.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.6     During the post-NMLP interviews the supervisors (a) indicated whether they had&#13;
noticed any changes in the previously identified managerial skills and behaviors of their&#13;
NMLP staff, (b) rated the extent to which his or her NMLP participant achieved the&#13;
previously identified development outcomes and management skills, and (c) assessed the&#13;
contribution of NMLP to the performance of his or her participant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.7     Four months after their new managers had completed the program, 18 out of 24&#13;
supervisors indicated that they had noticed changes in the managerial skills and behaviors&#13;
of their NMLP staff. The changes were revealed through less frequent requests for&#13;
advice, stronger leadership, more effective problem solving mechanisms, and improved&#13;
team management. Seventeen percent of the supervisors said they did not know whether&#13;
any change had happened, largely because they were unable to attribute any&#13;
improvements to NMLP because their staff were also benefiting from other training such&#13;
as coaching programs. Only two supervisors reported that they had not noticed any&#13;
changes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.8     Supervisors also rated the extent to which their NMLP participant had achieved&#13;
the pre-identified outcomes and skills. Supervisors' ratings were based on a 5-point&#13;
scale: broken down into these categories: "to a great extent" (5), "to a considerable&#13;
extent" (4), "to some extent" (3), "to a limited extent" (2), and "not at all" (1). The&#13;
overall mean rating (weighted average) for the extent to which the participants achieved&#13;
the pre-determined development outcomes was 3.54.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.9     On average, supervisors indicated that NMLP participants had achieved 60&#13;
percent of the pre-determined developmental outcomes to a "great or considerable"&#13;
extent, 24 percent to "some extent," and 16 percent to a "limited extent" (figure 20).30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.10    Figure 20 also shows the distribution of managerial skills ratings. Supervisors&#13;
indicated that NMLP participants had achieved 46 percent of the predetermined&#13;
management skills to a "great or considerable" extent, 42 percent to "some extent," and&#13;
&#13;
29. The number of development outcomes listed by each supervisor ranged between one and seven; the&#13;
number of management skills listed by each manager ranged between one and four.&#13;
30. None of the outcomes were rated as having no achievement at all.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 28&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12 percent to a "limited extent."31 The mean rating for the extent to which the&#13;
participants achieved the predetermined management skills was 3.51.&#13;

&#13;
4.11     Supervisors' responses to a general and all inclusive question --"Has the NMLP&#13;
contributed to the performance of your staff in their new managerial position" --&#13;
produced results that are in line with previous findings. The majority of the supervisors&#13;
(63 percent) said "yes," the NMLP has contributed to staff performance. One-third of the&#13;
supervisors said they could not attribute changes of participant performance strictly to&#13;
NMLP, and therefore said "don't know," and one supervisor said that NMLP has made&#13;
no contribution to the management capabilities of their NMLP staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.12     Overall, the majority of the supervisors indicated that NMLP is (a) "worth the&#13;
sacrifice" of having the manager away for three weeks, and (b) important for new&#13;
managers because it helps them "settle in their position" and exposes them to a "network&#13;
of colleagues" that they would have otherwise not known. More specifically, several&#13;
supervisors indicated that the NMLP helped participants to "gain a deeper understanding&#13;
on how to use authority," "pay attention to areas of self-improvement", and "gain&#13;
confidence in their management role." Three supervisors said that they wish the program&#13;
had existed when they first became managers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.13     Supervisors provided four specific recommendations for improving the NMLP&#13;
value and effectiveness:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
31.  None of the management skills were rated as having no achievement at all.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     29&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     · Provide regular follow ups to NMLP. Eight of the supervisors interviewed said&#13;
           that for the program to be effective, participants need additional training in the&#13;
           form of regular follow ups. The opinion of one supervisor summarizes this&#13;
           recommendation: "The current NMLP provides a good base, but it needs&#13;
           continuation and further deepening." A follow-up course would also keep the&#13;
           support network for the new managers in operation.&#13;
&#13;
     · Ensure timely course delivery to new incoming managers. "Consider timing the&#13;
           program's delivery to take place within the first six months after a new manager&#13;
           is assigned to his/her new position." Supervising managers would like the&#13;
           program to be available early in the manager's career.&#13;
&#13;
     · Tailor NMLP to Bank needs. As one supervisor said, "It is important to&#13;
           recognize the need for tailoring NMLP material to the Bank's reality." This&#13;
           would require incorporating case studies that are based on actual "real life"&#13;
           cases regarding a number of issues, including but not limited to project&#13;
           management, performance management, and conflict resolution. One-half of the&#13;
           supervisors highlighted the need for aligning NMLP to the Bank's work to make&#13;
           it more relevant and useful for Bank managers.&#13;
&#13;
     · Strengthen NMLP in three specific areas. Supervisors indicated that NMLP&#13;
           could be even more effective than it has been to date if it would emphasize the&#13;
           three topics that continue to be challenging issues in the Bank environment --&#13;
           cultural diversity, conflict management (including delivering hard news), and&#13;
           resource management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  NMLP STAFF SURVEY FINDINGS&#13;
&#13;
4.14     The data used for this analysis were based on responses from subordinates of new&#13;
managers to determine the impact of the NMLP on the perceptions of subordinates about&#13;
their managers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.15     To assess the impact of NMLP from the perspective of subordinates, we studied&#13;
the results of the 2005 staff survey for two groups of NMLP participants: a quasi-control&#13;
group of new managers who had not yet completed NMLP in November 2005 when the&#13;
2005 staff survey was being administered (cohorts 9 and 10, with 39 managers rated by&#13;
subordinates), and a treatment group of new managers who had already completed&#13;
NMLP by the time of the staff survey (cohorts 7 and 8 with 31 managers rated by&#13;
subordinates).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.16     Results of five staff survey questions related to the "my manager" section of the&#13;
staff survey were extracted by HR for both the control and treatment groups. Table 4&#13;
reports percent of favourable ratings for both the control and treatment groups.32 To&#13;
&#13;
32.  Testing the difference of mean ratings showed no statistically significant difference between the&#13;
treatment and control groups, not even for staff survey item 36.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     30&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
maintain confidentiality, HR was unable to provide individual ratings for every manager.&#13;
The data obtained were aggregated based on ratings by subordinates for every manager.&#13;
For every manager we obtained (a) the average ratings (using a 1 to 5 scale), (b) percent&#13;
of "favorable" (4 or 5 ratings), and (c) the approximate number of subordinate responses&#13;
that were used to calculate the ratings (1 if n&lt;10, 2 if n&gt;=10 and n&lt;20, 3 if n&gt;=20).&#13;

&#13;

 discussion.                                           79.4                   77.5            0.51       0.61&#13;
&#13;
 30: My manager displays the people&#13;
 management skills to effectively lead the group.      68.3                   66.8            0.32       0.75&#13;
&#13;
 31: My manager is supportive of our&#13;
 workgroup.                                            84.3                   83.2            0.33       0.74&#13;
&#13;
 33: My manager fosters collaboration with other&#13;
 groups whose work relates to ours.                    75.8                   75.7            0.02       0.98&#13;
&#13;
 36: My manager provides me with timely&#13;
 feedback to enhance my performance.                   64.2                   55.5            2.35       0.02&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.17     The unavailability of individual participant level data limited the scope of the&#13;
analysis. An ideal significance test would use the original raw scores (either 1 to 5 scores&#13;
or a binary favorable/unfavorable scale) to calculate chi-squares statistics.34 A&#13;
comparison of percent favorable ratings using chi-squares, however, is valid only if we&#13;
are comparing the fully disaggregated ratings of individual subordinates. Because we did&#13;
not have the exact number of subordinates for each rating, we could not make accurate&#13;
calculations.35 The scope of our analysis allowed only significance testing by way of&#13;
comparing unweighted percent favorable scores (4 or 5) using a two-tailed t-test.36&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.18     The results are not as optimistic as the pre- and post self-assessments. In four of&#13;
five cases, we note that there are no statistically significant differences between the&#13;
treatment and control groups (even at a 10 percent significance level; see table 4 last&#13;
column). The only survey item that shows a statistically significant difference in&#13;
favorable ratings is "My manager provides me with timely feedback to enhance my&#13;
performance".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
33.  Percent ratings represent average of averages.&#13;
34.  Although it is highly unlikely that an "ideal" test would create results that conflict with those presented&#13;
above.&#13;
35.  A simple test based on the conservative assumption that each manager has 10 subordinates creates&#13;
similar results to those shown above (i.e., only question 36 is significantly different).&#13;
36.  A comparison of mean ratings using the average 1 to 5 scoring is not valid because the distribution of&#13;
ratings is not normal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       31&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                              5. CONCLUSIONS&#13;
&#13;
5.1   This evaluation has:&#13;
&#13;
   · Assessed the NMLP's success in reaching its goals for the three modules;&#13;
&#13;
   · Assessed the program's usefulness and gauged the extent to which managers&#13;
       apply the knowledge and skills gained from the program in their day-to-day&#13;
       work;&#13;
&#13;
   · Assessed the improvements in Module 1; and&#13;
&#13;
   · Provided recommendations for continuous improvement.&#13;
&#13;
5.2   Based on this evaluation, the authors conclude that the NMLP is a helpful&#13;
program to the participants and should be continued. Recommendations to improve the&#13;
program for upcoming cohorts include:&#13;
&#13;
   · Improve quality and reduce duration of Module 1. Module 1 continued to&#13;
       receive lower ratings than the other modules, even though the content of the&#13;
       module in Phase II was different from that in Phase I.&#13;
&#13;
   · Align NMLP with the day-to-day management issues of the Bank and tailor&#13;
       the program to Bank needs. Both NMLP participants and their supervisors&#13;
       highlighted the need for aligning NMLP to the Bank's work. To increase&#13;
       alignment, NMLP participants made two suggestions: (a) allocate more time to&#13;
       "real world/actual" Bank/IFC case studies that cover HR management, change&#13;
       management, and resource management; and (b) develop action plans that&#13;
       enable participants to practice and apply NMLP skills.&#13;
&#13;
   · Design follow-up refresher courses. Participants as well as supervisors noted&#13;
       that refresher courses are necessary in order to "provide a systematic&#13;
       continuation and further deepening" of the program. A follow-up course would&#13;
       also keep the support network in operation for the new managers.&#13;
&#13;
   · Ensure timely course delivery to new incoming managers. Supervising&#13;
       managers would like the program to be available early in the manager's career&#13;
       within the first six months after a new manager is assigned to his/her new&#13;
       position.&#13;
&#13;
   · Strengthen NMLP in three specific areas. Supervising managers also&#13;
       indicated that NMLP could be even more effective than it has been to date if it&#13;
       would emphasize the three topics that continue to be challenging issues in the&#13;
       Bank environment -- cultural diversity, conflict management (including&#13;
       delivering hard news), and resource management.&#13;

APPENDIX 1: SUMMARY OF PHASE I EVALUATION&#13;
METHODOLOGY, FINDINGS, AND RESULTS&#13;
&#13;
Methodology&#13;
&#13;
Phase I assessed the usefulness of the NMLP for cohorts 3 and 4 through three methods:&#13;
&#13;
     · Level 1 evaluations immediately following each of the three modules to assess&#13;
          their quality;&#13;
     · Self-assessments completed by the participants approximately six months after&#13;
          Module 3; and&#13;
     · Comparison of pre- and post assessments of participants by their subordinates&#13;
          (one month before Module 1 and three months after Module 3) to assess changes&#13;
          in managerial performance and behaviors as a result of the course.&#13;
&#13;
Findings&#13;
&#13;
Self-assessments coupled with pre and post subordinate assessment of the participants'&#13;
managerial performance yielded to four findings:&#13;
&#13;
     1. As compared to Modules 2 and 3, participants gave low ratings to Module 1 in&#13;
          terms of its coverage and success in meeting its objectives;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     2. Subordinates of the NMLP participants, who were surveyed before and after their&#13;
          managers participated in the program, did not provide any evidence of improved&#13;
          performance and behaviors by the participants as a result of their attendance;37&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     3. Participants who were already performing well according to their subordinates&#13;
          before completing the NMLP continued to do well after the course, while&#13;
          managers who had not performed well before the program did not improve as a&#13;
          result of attending the NMLP; and,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     4. Participants reported receiving favorable feedback on their management style&#13;
          from their supervisors after attending the NMLP.&#13;
&#13;
Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
Based on these findings, the Phase I evaluation made the following recommendations:&#13;
&#13;
     a. Revise Module 1 to make considerable changes - including improvements&#13;

statistically significant changes in the perception of managerial performance and/or behaviors during the&#13;
time period covered by the study." (Zia, Hanson, and Gunnarsson 2004)&#13;

            Evaluation of the New Managers Leadership
            Program (NMLP) - phase II
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In July 2002, the World Bank's
            Human Resources Services Leadership and Organizational
            Effectiveness Group (HRSLO) launched a three-module program
            for newly appointed and recruited managers. This New
            Managers Leadership Program (NMLP) responded to Bank-wide
            feedback from senior Bank managers, human resources
            managers, and other Bank professionals about the need for
            such a program. The NMLP aims to: (a) clarify the
            institution's expectations of managers and strengthen
            managers capabilities to deliver results through effective
            core relationship skills; (b) increase managers capabilities
            to create the results they want in ways that support
            work-life balance; and, (c) build managers knowledge and
            skills in leading change at the unit level and provide
            opportunities to apply their new knowledge to work
            situations as they continue to build the cohort as a
            learning and support community. The NMLP's three
            modules are presented over a seven- to eight-month period,
            with several weeks separating each module. Each new manager
            completes all three modules, generally with the same
            managerial cohort. As of the date of this evaluation, 10
            managerial cohorts have completed the NMLP.
