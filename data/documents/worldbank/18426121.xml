Global Gas Flaring Reduction Public-Private Partnership Charter&#13;
Adopted on September 28, 2009&#13;
Effective on April 26, 2010, as amended&#13;
A. Background&#13;
The World Bank estimates that over 150 billion cubic meters of natural gas associated with crude oil&#13;
production is being flared and vented annually. The flaring and venting of natural gas associated with&#13;
crude oil production and other greenhouse gases associated with upstream petroleum operations ("Gas&#13;
Flaring") wastes energy resources and adds the equivalent of 400 million tons of CO2 in annual&#13;
emissions.&#13;
Launched at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in August 2002, as a Type II public-private&#13;
partnership the Global Gas Flaring Reduction partnership (the "GGFR") is committed to reducing Gas&#13;
Flaring globally as a means to address climate change concerns. GGFR participants desire to overcome&#13;
the barriers to flare reduction by sharing global best practices and implementing country specific&#13;
programs.&#13;
The GGFR facilitates efforts to reduce Gas Flaring globally by promoting effective regulatory&#13;
frameworks, and investments in infrastructure to support gas utilization in local and international&#13;
energy markets. Poverty reduction is an integral part of the GGFR program through the supply of clean&#13;
fuels and the creation of new employment.&#13;
B. Vision&#13;
The GGFR seeks a world free of routine gas flaring and venting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿C. Mission Statement&#13;
The GGFR is a catalyst for reducing wasteful and undesirable practices of gas flaring and venting through&#13;
policy change, stakeholder facilitation and project implementation.&#13;
D. Activities&#13;
The GGFR focuses on the following activities:&#13;
1.  Global activities&#13;
Global activities include but are not limited to (i) the support, adoption and implementation of&#13;
standards and practices recommended in the GGFR Report Number 4, "Voluntary Standard for&#13;
Global Gas Flaring and Venting Reduction", dated May 2004, as may be amended from time to time&#13;
(the "Voluntary Standard"), and (ii) the development of recommendations on legal, regulatory,&#13;
technical and fiscal best practices to promote Gas Flaring reduction investments.&#13;
2. Country-specific activities&#13;
Country-specific activities include but are not limited to (i) assistance to governments to gather Gas&#13;
Flaring data from their countries and develop Gas Flaring reduction strategies and associated&#13;
Country Implementation Plans ("CIPs") based on Associated Gas Recovery Plans ("AGRPs") prepared&#13;
by companies, and (ii) the promotion of gas commercialization through associated gas utilization&#13;
reviews, demonstration projects, small scale use of gas, development of Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG)&#13;
recovery projects, and carbon financing.&#13;
3. Dissemination activities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Dissemination activities include but are not limited to (i) the organization of country/regional&#13;
workshops (for knowledge transfer, best practice dissemination, etc.), (ii) the organization of high-&#13;
level international conferences, (iii) publication of reports, and (iv) communication and media&#13;
