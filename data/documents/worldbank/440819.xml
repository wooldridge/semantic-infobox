ABSTRACT&#13;
This paper surveys the issues raised by technology transfer to&#13;
developing countries. Technology is a vital part of the development&#13;
process, a necessary input into all activity. Because of the&#13;
historical domination of research and development by developed&#13;
countries, a very large part of the technology used is transferred&#13;
from developed countries. The transfer raises four major issues:&#13;
those of the costs of the transfer, the appropriateness of&#13;
products and techniques which are transferred, the effects of the&#13;
transfer on learning and technological development in LDCs, and&#13;
the effects on independence. The paper considers the consequence&#13;
of the transfer and the range of policies that might be adopted,&#13;
nationally and internationally, in relation to each of these issues.&#13;
It is argued that the appropriate policies will vary according to&#13;
the stage of development of each country, its technological&#13;
capacity and its own objectives. However, in general it is&#13;
concluded that an active technology policy is called for if&#13;
the costs associated with technology transfer are to be reduced&#13;
and the benefits increased.  While it is easy to design suitable&#13;
policies on paper, it is much more difficult to ensure that they&#13;
are effective in practice.&#13;

SUMJARY&#13;
Technology is knowledge of how to do all those things associated&#13;
with economic activity. Thus, the acquisition of technology is as important&#13;
to the development process and as essential an aspect of the process of&#13;
investment as the accumulation of financial resources. Moreover, because&#13;
technology is continuously changing, with new products and processes being&#13;
developed year-by-year, the need to acquire technology is also a continuous&#13;
one, and one that expands with expansion in economic activity.&#13;
Two basic facts underlie the process of international technology&#13;
transfer. First, the origin of the vast majority of technological develop-&#13;
ments is concentrated in a few developed countries. Although some developing&#13;
countries are beginning to promote local technological development, they&#13;
remain dependent on tlhe developed countries for most of their technology.&#13;
Secondly, a large part of the market for technology has been commercialized&#13;
with proprietary rights acquired in the technology. Since technology has many&#13;
of the characteristics of a public good, such that the marginal cost of&#13;
communicating it to others is very low com- ared with the initial costs of&#13;
development, the commercialization of the technology market has involved&#13;
imposing restrictions - legal and other - on the free communication of know-&#13;
ledge. The result is that the technology market is highly imperfect, the&#13;
price charged for technology tends to be oligopolistic, and consequently there&#13;
is considerable scope for abuse,and potential for bargaining on the part of&#13;
buyers. The transfer of technology consists, in part, in the transfer of the&#13;
required knowledge; in part, in the transfer of various marketing rights&#13;
associated withl the knowledge. These include the right to use trademarks,&#13;
access to specified markets, and so on.  In many cases, the two are  inextricably&#13;
connected, so that if a buyer wishes to purchase the knowledge he also has to&#13;
purchase the m.arket rights, and vice-versa.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- viii -&#13;
Teclhnology is transferred in a number of different forms, ranging&#13;
from formal (technology contracts) to informal (meetings, people changing&#13;
jobs). The process is often differentiated according to the degree of&#13;
packaging involved in the transfer with the most packaged transfers consist.r.g&#13;
of the bundle of services associated with direct foreign investment, and the&#13;
least packaged in the direct purchase of machinery and other inputs. There&#13;
are various intermediate forms including joint ventures and contracts involving&#13;
associated management services *and knowhow. In any particular case, the&#13;
mechanism of transfer depends on the willingness of the supplier to supply&#13;
the technology in different forms and the desire and ability of the buyer&#13;
to buy it in a particular form. There is considerable variation in the way&#13;
different countries acquire technology reflecting differences in national&#13;
policies, in national capacities and in the industrial composition of the&#13;
technology transferred. In some countries, e.g., historically Jartn and&#13;
currently the Andean Pact countries, the most packaged forms of technology&#13;
transfer, notably direct foreign investmene, are severely restricted. The&#13;
degree of development influences the extent of packaging because less developed&#13;
countries may lack the capacity to put the package together for themselves. In&#13;
general, more sophisticated (technologically) industries show a greater&#13;
degree of packaging than less sophisticated. Despite recent support by some&#13;
LDCs for less packaging, no definite worldt-ide trends towards depackaging can&#13;
be discerned empirically.&#13;
Developing countries' objectives towards technology transfer have&#13;
evolved. Immediately following independence, most countries were keen to&#13;
industralize quickly, and to maximize the technology inflow.  Hence, they&#13;
introduced a host of tax incentives to encourage teclnology inflow.  As time&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ix -&#13;
proceeded, it emerged that the indiscriminate import of technology nad involved&#13;
high costs, had led to dualistic patterns of development, had accentuated&#13;
dependency and had inhibited learring effects.  Consequently, new objectives&#13;
evolved: in particular, many developing countries wished to regulate the&#13;
inflow of technology to reduce the costs of transfer, to increase the in-&#13;
dependence of decision making and to promote local technological innovation.&#13;
In addition, in response to employment and other problems, some countries&#13;
recognized a need for more appropriate technology.&#13;
Costs of Technology Transfer&#13;
The nominal declared costs of technology transfer need bear little&#13;
relationship to actual costs because companies which supply more than one&#13;
service may choose the form in which they receive payment. For example,&#13;
payments for technology may appear as royalty payments or as profits or as&#13;
overinvoiced import prices. The problems of disguised nayments arise in&#13;
most acute form for the most packaged forms of transfer, but are also present&#13;
to some extent in other forms, such as joint ventures.  The high proportion of&#13;
intra-firm trade and of intra-firm technology flows gives rise to the possibility&#13;
of disguised payments. There is considerable evidence of overinvoicing of imports&#13;
and underinvoicing of oxports. Wlile the evidence suggests that this&#13;
occurs to the greatest extent in pharmaceuticals, there is strong evidence of&#13;
similar practices in many other industries. Evidence of such practices has been&#13;
collected in a number of Latin American countries, and in India and Greece.&#13;
The industries covered include pharmaceuticals, clhemicals, metal products,&#13;
minerals and rubber products. It is difficult to know how much of the&#13;
disguised payments should be attributed to technology transfer and how much&#13;
to other facLors.  The need for technology transfer normally gives rise to&#13;
th!c po;sIbility of such paymuent:s, but their extent is influenced by recipient&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- x &#13;
governments' economic policies as well as by lack of compet;tion in the&#13;
world industry.&#13;
The process of technology transfer imposes additional costs as&#13;
the result of restrictive clauses associated with it. In the case of direct&#13;
overseas investment, the restrictions are implicit. For technology con-&#13;
tracts between independent parties, they are an explicit part of the contract.&#13;
There is evidence of widespread restrictions embodied in technology contracts.&#13;
The restrictive clauses include limitations    (or total bans) on exports,&#13;
tied purchase of inputs, machinery and parts, limitations on competing supplies,&#13;
and constraints which limit the dynamic effects of transfer by req iring excessive&#13;
use of expatriate personnel and discouraging local r. and d.&#13;
UNCTAD estimated the overt costs of technology transfer to be 5%&#13;
of non-petroleum exports of developing countries in 1968, and estimated that&#13;
this proportion would rise steadily over the subsequent 10 years.  Miile&#13;
other evidence suggests that the UNCTAD estimates (particularly in relation&#13;
to the rate of increase after 1968) may be overestimates, adding some .stimate&#13;
of .he implicit and indirect costs would substantially increase the costs.  for&#13;
example, to add 10 of the costs of imported capital equipment and chemicals&#13;
and one-fifth of the declared profits on foreign investment to the UNCTAD&#13;
estimates would more than double them.  The high costs do not necessarily mean,&#13;
of course, that the price is not worth payirg.  But they do suggest that there&#13;
may be considerable gains to be made from bargaining, especially in view of the&#13;
non-competitiveness of muchi of the market.&#13;
Independence&#13;
Technology transfer limits the indepenidence of decision making.  This&#13;
is most obvious in the case of direct inx'tstment, but occurs to a considerablc&#13;
extent witlh respect to transfers between independent parties where technology&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- xi -&#13;
contracts include very heavy restrictions on freedom of decision making.&#13;
It has been claimed that technology transfer has come to replace ownership&#13;
as a mechanism of control.&#13;
Learning&#13;
The ability to make independent technological choices, to adapt&#13;
and improve upon chosen techniques and products, and eventually to generate new&#13;
technology are essential aspects of the development process. Relatively little&#13;
is known about the process of accumulation of technological capacity. Broadly,&#13;
three stages may be identified: in the first, the ability to make independent&#13;
technol'rical choices is developed; in the second, minor innovations occur&#13;
locally; and in the third, the capacity to create new technology is developed.&#13;
In general, the stages occur sequentially. There is a complex relationship&#13;
between the import of technology and the development of local technological&#13;
capacity, and one that encompasses both complementarities and conflicts.&#13;
Some import of technology is required as a basis for learning. But highly&#13;
packaged imports tend to limit the development of the ability to make&#13;
independent choices. Minor technological change may occur on the basis of&#13;
imported technology - this seems to respond to a mixture of technological&#13;
capacity and competitive and other pressures. The third stage - local de-&#13;
velopment of technology - may be inhibited by indiscriminate imports - partly&#13;
because of restrictive clauses involved in technology contracts which limit&#13;
the dynamic effects; partly because the foreign technology associated with foreign&#13;
trademarks tends to have a strong market advantage over local teclhnology; hence, loca&#13;
technology, even when developed, is often not used, and thus the incentive to develop&#13;
it Is much reduced. The most successful examples of technological development&#13;
have combined selective import of foreign technology with positive measures&#13;
to promote local technology. Thus the local developments are provided&#13;
with the foreign knowhow they need and the protection and promotion necessary.&#13;
Promotional measures include provision of infrastrtucture, tcchnology plans,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- xii -&#13;
subsidies and incentives to r. and d. and government procurem2nt practices that&#13;
favour local technology. Japan's technological development is a very success-&#13;
ful case of this sort of policy: technology was imported, then adapted do-&#13;
mestically and promoted in both public and private sectors.  Other successful&#13;
examples, involving a similar comlbination of policies, have been observed in&#13;
a few cases in Mexico and India.&#13;
Policies Towards Technology Imoorts&#13;
Relevant policies vary according to objectives, although there is&#13;
considerable overlap with some po:Licies serving more than one objective, and&#13;
the objectives themselves being mutually reinforcing.  For example, policies&#13;
which eliminate restrictive practices will also increase independence, reduce&#13;
costs and may contribute to the learning effects of the technology.&#13;
The set of relevant policies varies with the stage of develcpment, and&#13;
particularly the technological and administrative capacity of the country con-&#13;
cerned. Policies aimed at improving the terms of technology transfer are rele-&#13;
vant to most countries. Although they involve administrative costs, the potential&#13;
gains are lar-e, as shown by the experience of countries which have followed them.&#13;
Iowever, policies of selectivity towards imported technology require a greater&#13;
degree of technological sophistication and administrative judgment. These&#13;
policies are only worth pursuing where there exists fairly considerable local&#13;
technoJogical capacity; they may best be introduced on an industry-by-industry&#13;
basis.&#13;
The general economic strategy of the country is of relevance to the&#13;
effectiveness and outcome of technology policies.  The terms of technology&#13;
tranisfer are likely to be more competitive, the more competitive the general&#13;
environment is, and the less government policies (e.g. of protection) give rise&#13;
to quasi-rents.  But non-competitivc elements in the world industrial structure&#13;
me.nn that s;pecial technology policies are required in addition t,o general&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- xiii -&#13;
competitive policies. As far as local technological development is concerned,&#13;
the relationship between general economic policies and local technological&#13;
developments is less clear. While it is often argued that heavy protection&#13;
and "distorted" factor prices remove incentives for local adaption, there&#13;
are a number of examples of local technological'innovation occurring in a generally&#13;
protected environment. Thus, India and Argentina have developed technology&#13;
locally,in a few cases sufficiently to export the technology to neighbouring&#13;
countries.  The sort of pressures which lead to local technological innovation&#13;
are of many kinds, e.g., absence of particular raw materials, and not confined&#13;
to cost pressures associated with pri.e and exchange rate policies.&#13;
A number of countries have tried to reduce the packaging element in imported&#13;
technology. A major reason is to secure greater independence of decision&#13;
making: this is desired in itself, and also as an essential part of the&#13;
learning process so that countries may develop the capacity first o make&#13;
independent technological choices, and subsequently to develop their own&#13;
technology. The policy is also related to the question of costs, since it&#13;
appears that costs tend to be higher the more packaged the form of transfer.&#13;
The policies may be mandatory - e.g., forbidding majority foreign owner-&#13;
ship in some or all industries - or rely on incentives. An essential&#13;
complement to policies towards depackaging is the introduction of some&#13;
sort of regulation over technology transfer between independent parties;&#13;
otlherwise, as indicalted by empirical evidence, many of the problems associated&#13;
with direct investment re-emerge via technology contracts. A number of countries&#13;
have introduced National Registers of Technology, permitting registra-&#13;
tion only if the cbntracts fulfill various criteria with respect to terms and&#13;
restrictive clauses. In general, restrictive clauses (e.g., with respect to&#13;
export bans and Lying inputOi) are outlawed.  Investigations of the results of&#13;
thesO policics in two countries - Col.ombia and Mexico - have slhown very&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- xiv -&#13;
substantial  foreign exchange gains, and the outlawing of a large number of&#13;
restrictive clauses at relativelyl low administrative Cost.   But it has not&#13;
yet been thoroughly establislhed how far such policies have had de facto&#13;
as against de jure success, as many of the explicit and formal restrictions&#13;
may have been replaced by informal implicit ones.&#13;
Changes in the tax system may be designed to improve the terms of&#13;
technology transfer. In particular, if corporate taxation is made independent&#13;
of the degree of underinvoicing or overinvoicing (either by formula apportion-&#13;
ment or by a uniformity of rates approach), the foreign exchange and revenue&#13;
loss cause by these practices will be r,much reduced. The removal of tax&#13;
incentives towards overseas investment, which have been shown to be ineffective,&#13;
would also improve the terms of technology transfer.&#13;
Policies to protect and promote local technological developments involve&#13;
the selective import of foreign techno'ogy as well as promotional measures towards&#13;
domestic developments. Industries in which there is substantial local potential,&#13;
and some likelihood of long run comparative advantage in technological develop-&#13;
ment, should be selected; in these industries technology imports should be&#13;
permitted where they are compiementary with and conducive to local technological&#13;
development and restricted where they are competitive with local developments.&#13;
Teclhnological development is an infant industry, with strong externalities,&#13;
wlhich accordingly requires protection.  There are numerous - and fairly well&#13;
known - promotional measures, including government subsidies, training and&#13;
education and so on. None of them have proved to be particularly effective on&#13;
1/&#13;
their own, but at both macro and micro levels a combination of protection and&#13;
promotion does seemn to have been effective.&#13;
Tuie system of patents and trademarks in effect gives stronig protection&#13;
to foreign technology as against local technolngy. By so doing, it also tends&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- xv -&#13;
to raise the cost of the foreign technology. Five-sixths of patents are held&#13;
by foreigners in LDCs, and of these, over 90% are unexploitec.  International&#13;
discussion and negotlation about the reform of the system is currently under-&#13;
way. Trademarks act as a powerful protective device to foreign technology because of&#13;
the marketing power they bestow. LDC trademarks are relatively undeveloped; they&#13;
formed half of new registrations in 1974, but this was substantially less than some&#13;
ten years before. Various reforms are possible, including complete outlawing&#13;
of trademarks, outlawing foreign trademarks onlv, requiring joint foreign and&#13;
local trademarks, and imposing a heavy tax on trademarks. The main problem is&#13;
to combine consumer protection with a r.duction of the role of trademarks.&#13;
Trademarks tend to be heavily concentrated in a few industries (notably&#13;
pharmaceuticals) and action could be restricted to one or two sectors, initially.&#13;
Any restrictive policies need to be accompanied by consumer education and pro-&#13;
motion of alternative methods of guaranteeing quality, e.g. by developing government&#13;
standards.&#13;
Local technological capacity in tiird world countries is of critical&#13;
importance: it is a vital part of the development process, it is necessary for&#13;
independence , to improve bargaining power in relation to the import of&#13;
technology, and to generate appropriate technical change. While&#13;
there appears to be a certain amount of technological choice today, the continued&#13;
concentration of technical change on advanced country technology is likely to&#13;
result in increasingly inappropriate techniques. Unless developing countries&#13;
undertake r. and d. in alternative directions, the choice of technology available&#13;
in the future will be increasingly circumscribed and irrelevant to the needs of&#13;
the world's poorest, The development of a continuous process of technological&#13;
change - new techniques and products - in an appropriate direction in the&#13;
developing countries is essential if the choice is to be widened.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- xvi -&#13;
Appropriate Technology&#13;
Technology recently developed in advanced countries tends to be in-&#13;
appropriate, in many respects, for many LDCs. This is because it is designed&#13;
to meet the needs of the advanced countries; it tends for example to be in-&#13;
creasingly capital intensive. Its use in poor countries involves a concentration&#13;
of investment resources in the modern sector, exacerbating differentials and&#13;
contributing to the problems of unemployment and underemployment. Products&#13;
designed for advanced country consumers are ill suited to meet the basic needs&#13;
of poor people. However, the high productivity of much modern technology and&#13;
the efficiency and economies of scale a- sociated with advanced country products&#13;
may make the technology the best choice, given the absence of efficient alterna-&#13;
tives. Appropriate technology consists of technology more in line with develop-&#13;
ing country needs and resouices; it consists of more labour intensive processes&#13;
in the modern sector, and the development of new and improved techniques and&#13;
products for the traditional sector. The promotion of more appropriate tech-&#13;
nology includes the selection of more approp--iate technology among known tech-&#13;
nologies (including "old" techniques from ad\anced countries and secondhand&#13;
machinery) and the development of new appropriate technologies.&#13;
The development strategy a country adopts strongly influences its&#13;
technological options. If a country's consumption patterns are similar to those&#13;
of developed countries, and if its main trading orientation is with developed&#13;
countries, then the main body of technology it uses in the modern sector will&#13;
need to be that of the developed countries. Consumption patterns are likely&#13;
to be similar to those of developed countries among countries with an unequal&#13;
income distribution, an "open" policy towards technological imports, and lack&#13;
of indigenous cultural factors which inhibit the demonstration effect.  Some&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- xvii -&#13;
modification of technology is clearly possible - and indeed hbppens - even in&#13;
this sort of situation, but modifications are likely to be largely a matter of&#13;
time lags in adopting the latest advanced country technology, more labour&#13;
intensive ancilliary activities, and modifications rendered necessary by&#13;
differences in the size of the market.&#13;
With more equal income distribution and with obstacles (cultural,&#13;
economic or legal) preventing the domination of advanced country products, the&#13;
potential for appropriate and self-generated technology will be greater. Trade&#13;
in manufactured products with advanced countries has generally involved the&#13;
import of technology from advanced countries, at least in the initial stage.&#13;
Trade between developing countries is more likely to be consistent with the use&#13;
of locally generated appropriate technology. Appropriate technology consists&#13;
both in modification in "modern" sector products and techniques and in up-&#13;
grading "traditional" sector technology. Even in countries with advanced country&#13;
oriented modern sectors, there is potential for appropriate technology in the&#13;
traditional sector to help raise productivitv and incomes and meet basic needs.&#13;
Policies to promote appropriate technology consist in policies&#13;
determining the demand for (or selection of) different products and techniques,&#13;
and policies determining the supply of technologies. On the demand side, the&#13;
policies concerned are chiefly national; they include determinants of income&#13;
distribution and consumption patterns, tradint strategy, policies determining&#13;
control over investible resources by different types of decision makers, and&#13;
relative factor prices. On the supply side, they include the collection of&#13;
information about different technologies and its diffusion, and research and&#13;
development and the creation of new technologies.  Potentially, there could be&#13;
an important role for international institutions on the supply side assisting in&#13;
informatiJon collection and diffusion, and in fundinig appropriate research.&#13;

Technology transfer belLween developing countries could have an&#13;
important role to play in increasing developing countries technological&#13;
independence and bargaining power and in promoting appropriate technology.&#13;
There are some indications that such trade is expanding; third world MNCs&#13;
are developing as is third worlcl consultancy and trade in capital goods.&#13;
As with similar developments, there is a danger that new imbalances and&#13;
dependencies within the third world will arise as a result.&#13;
There is a complex system of relationships between past policy&#13;
towards technology, policy makers and policy making. Countries which have&#13;
been heavily dependent on foreign technology, particularly in the form of&#13;
foreign investment, find it more difficult to regulate it than those which&#13;
have relied on it to a lesser extent and have maintained an arm's length&#13;
relationship with foreign suppliers. Similarly, patterns of production and&#13;
consumption which are broadly inappropriate set in force strong forces making&#13;
for similar inappropriate choices in the future. The extent of current free-&#13;
dom of decision making depends in large part on past policies. Today's policies,&#13;
then, will partly determine future opions. tn this context, radical delinking&#13;
might be a tactica]. and temporary move to strengthen a country's position in&#13;
future linked relationships.&#13;

International Technology Transfer: Issues and Policy Options l/&#13;
Technology is knowledge - knowledge of how to do and make useful things.2/&#13;
At the heart of any form of economic activity from the least to the most sophis-&#13;
ticated lies the technology or knowledge of how the activity is carried out. Be-&#13;
fore initiating any economic activity then the first prerequisite is the acqui-&#13;
sition of this knowledge. But technology is not randomly and freely distributed&#13;
throughout the world, as would appear from some economists' models. Rather, as&#13;
part of the process of historical development, the development of technology&#13;
has been heavily concentrated in certain parts of the world, notably the developed&#13;
countries. Moreover, much of this technology has been commercialized with pro-&#13;
prietary rights acquired in it so that it is not freely transferred but is sold&#13;
commercially. The international transfer - in many cases involving the international&#13;
sale - of technology is thus an essential precondition for economic development.&#13;
Since technology changes continuously, with new or improved products, new mater-&#13;
ials or new uses of old materials, and new techniques of production, the need to&#13;
acquire technology is not once for all, but a continuing one. Thus the question of&#13;
technology transfer - how it is transferred, the terms of transfer and the effects&#13;
of the transfer - is at least as critical to economic development, as the ques-&#13;
tion of transfer of cap4tal resources. In recent years this fact has been widely&#13;
recognized, as shown by the many international conferences, resolutions etc. on the&#13;
subject.  This paper attempts to summarize sume of the main issues that arise in&#13;
connection with the international transfer of technology to developing countries 3/&#13;
1/ I am grateful for comments on an earlier draft to a number of people&#13;
in the World Bank: I would especially like to mention Howard Pack&#13;
and Larry Westphal.&#13;
/ Merrill defines it as 'skills, knowledge and procedures for making,&#13;
using and doing useful things.'&#13;
3   There are many problems that arise in connection with internal technology&#13;
transfer-i.e. the transfer of technology or its diffusion within a nation,&#13;
but these are not considered in this paper.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

I. Why Technology is Transferred&#13;
The international transfer of technology takes place when knowledge in&#13;
one country - which may have been developed there or acquired from somewhere else -&#13;
is communicated to people in another country, for use there. The communication&#13;
may occur freely outside the market, or may be a commercial transaction. Effective&#13;
communication of knowledge for economic activity is not normally just a matter of&#13;
communication of design sheets and formulae, but also involves an essential soft-&#13;
ware element, the communication of how to use the information, which may require&#13;
the transfer of skills, managerial knowhow and so on.l/ The sale of technology&#13;
occurs when some essential part of the package which constitutes the technology&#13;
is in the commercial possession of some agent, who will only part with it for a&#13;
price.  This 'possession' may take the form of monopolization of the desired&#13;
knowledge, which may occur naturally when it is first developed, and before others&#13;
have caught up with the technological developments, or may be the result of legal&#13;
restrictions protecting the owners of the technology, allowing them to sell it, and&#13;
preventing imitators, as with the patent laws and those related to trademarks.&#13;
In either case a monopolistic element enters the market enabling the owners of the&#13;
technology to earn some monopolistic rents - i.e. to charge a price in excess of the&#13;
2/&#13;
actual costs of communication.- The monopolistic element may pervade a much wider&#13;
area than that specifically covered by legal protection, because of the bundled as-&#13;
pect of much technology, so that some element of the bundle which is apparently free-&#13;
ly available without legal restriction is in practice protected by restrictions af-&#13;
fecting some other element in the bundle. The actual costs of communication are&#13;
1/ "Technology, used in this study, refers to the package of product designs, pro-&#13;
duction and processing techniques and managerial systems that are used to manu-&#13;
facture particular industrial products." (Baranson, p. 13).  This paper adopts&#13;
this definition, but does not confine attention to industrial products.&#13;
2/  The justification for commercialization of the market for technology is that it&#13;
provides the necessary appropriability to induce private R. and D.  Part of&#13;
the excessive price (over and above costs of communication) constitute normal&#13;
returns to R. and D.  and should not, therefore, necessarily be classified as&#13;
monopoly profits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3-&#13;
by no means negl±giblef, Technology transfer may command a Drice to cover these&#13;
costs in the absence of any monopolistic elements in the market for technology.&#13;
Technology was defined above as knowledge of how to do and make useful&#13;
things. But in practice examination of the market for technology suggests that&#13;
in the process of commercialization of this market, the content of technology&#13;
transfer has become more complex than this. A major element in technology trans-&#13;
fer is the acquisition of the right to use certain trademarks and/or access to&#13;
certain markets and inputs. For shorthand we may describe the acquisition of&#13;
trademarks, and privileged access gained to markets and/or to inputs (which may&#13;
include an assurance that the firm will be kept up to date with later technical&#13;
developments) as marketing rights. These may be highly valuable to individual&#13;
firms in helping gain markets or inputs.  While they are often associated with the&#13;
communication of useful knowledge, and form a significant part of technology con-&#13;
'2/&#13;
tracts,- they are not themselves accurately described as consisting in-the communi-&#13;
cation of useful knowledge. Nonetheless, in the context of discussion of inter-&#13;
1/  Teece (1976) estimates the costs involved in transmitting and absorh-&#13;
ing all the relevant unembodied knowledge, and finds that these costs range&#13;
from 2 to 59% of total project costs.&#13;
2/ Trademarks were an aspect of 48% of technology contracts examined in Mlexico&#13;
and 58% in Argentina. But the estimates are very sensitive to the methodology&#13;
used. In a study of Brazil where each contract was divided into as many agree-&#13;
ments as there were contractual elements, trademarks formed 13.2% of the total.&#13;
But in Brazil trademark licenses are not allowed between parent and subsi-&#13;
diary company.  See UNCT.D (1977b) (paras. 1Z6 and 127)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
national technology transfer, the acquisition of marketing rights forms an im-&#13;
portant element of costs and is aLso a significant aspect of motivation.  Dis-&#13;
cussion of the international transfer of technology thus covers both the communi-&#13;
cation (or sale) of knowledge and the sale of marketing rights.&#13;
The internationnl transfer of technology takes place when three ccnditions&#13;
occur. First, decision makers in one country wish to use a certain technology;&#13;
secondly, that technology is not available locally; thirdly, they believe it is&#13;
cheaper for them to transfer the technology than to reproduce it locally. These&#13;
three conditions explain the quite substantia. amount of technology transfer be-&#13;
tween developed countries.-/ But they are present to a much greater extent ir.&#13;
relation to investment decisions in developing countries, such that a very la-.ge&#13;
proportion of investment in developing countries involves international technology&#13;
transfer chiefly      from developed countries.  The three conditions apply to a&#13;
definition of technology which encompasses the marketing element just described.&#13;
Condition one: investors wish to use a certain technology. For some observers it&#13;
appears almost axiomatic that countries should wish to, and would benefit from,&#13;
use of the latest technological developments: "Whatever the source, the increase&#13;
in the stock of useful knowledge and the extension of its application are of the&#13;
essence of modern economic growth....No matter where these teclinological and social&#13;
1/ See the analysis of eg. Posner (1961 and 1970) describing the 'technology&#13;
gap' conditions which give rise first to trade, and subsequently to technology&#13;
transfer between developed countries. A full explanation of international&#13;
technology transfer should go further than the above, first explaining why&#13;
a decision is made to produce a particular product in a particular country,&#13;
as against importing it. Technology gap, product cycle, and import substi-&#13;
tution cum jumping tariff barrier hypotheses provide explanations of the&#13;
initial decision to produce. See eg. Posner op. cit., Hufbauer (1966) Vernon&#13;
(1966) and Elirsch (1967), and (1§76) SPRU (1972)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
innovations emerge - and they are largely the product of the developed countries -&#13;
the economic growth of any nation delpends upon their adoption." (Kuznets, 1966)-&#13;
From the point of view of the soc4al. interest and long run development&#13;
prospects of developing countries, there are three reasons why one might questicn&#13;
or at least qualify this view.  First there are biases in the development of&#13;
technology: the characteristics of any technology are heavily influenced by&#13;
the economic and social conditions in the economy in which it is developed.-/&#13;
Thus technology developed for advanced societies often has characteristics which&#13;
are ill suited to much poorer economies: for example, technological advances in&#13;
rich societies tend to be increasingly capital-intensive, of increasing scale&#13;
of production and. designed. to produce products intended for high income consumers.&#13;
As we shall discuss more belcw, if imported unadapted into poor societies, these&#13;
characteristics have various undesirable effects. The Kuznets view of the un-&#13;
questionable superiority of the latest technology would cnly be invariably cor-&#13;
rect if this bias did not exist and technical advance were neutral with respect&#13;
to factor use and product design, raising the productivity of all types of tech-&#13;
niques equally, and enhancing the efficiezcy of all types of products equally.&#13;
aonetheless, recent technological advances do involve great gains in productivity&#13;
in resource use and this fact mar compensata for biases in characteristics, but it&#13;
does not do so Invariably. Secondly, there are sigaificant learning effects.&#13;
3I&#13;
The Japanese case-  4ilustrates the way in which restricted import of cechnology&#13;
may permit the local development of technological capacity. Again learning as-&#13;
pects vill be discussed =ore below. Thirdly, as already stated the technology&#13;
that Is transferred involves more than the mot recent technological advances; it&#13;
l1 See also Gerschenkuxof (1962) and Spencer (1970).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

also involves the transfer of marketing rights. While the knowledge itself may&#13;
be worth acquiring from a national point of view, marketing rights may not be.&#13;
These qualifications are made from the point of view of the national in-&#13;
terest of developing countries. They do not apply directly at the level of&#13;
the individual firm, where most technology decisions are made. It is not their&#13;
concern that amalgamatirg all the micro-decisions, the free import of advanced&#13;
country technology may cause biases in development patterns; individual firms&#13;
respond to this sort of consideration indirectly if differences in conditions&#13;
affect factor prices and consumer tastes. Long run learning effects are&#13;
externalities not allowed for in individual decision making while considerations&#13;
related to marketing rights enhance the individual decision maker's assessment&#13;
of the value of the technology in question rather than the reverse. For the&#13;
most part then, individual decision makers wish to acquire recent technology -&#13;
not necessarily the latest, the exact vintage depending upon technological&#13;
alternatives and the factor price/market situation in the country in&#13;
question. At a national level too, governments, keen to industrialize, wish&#13;
to have the 'best' technology, which is often identified with the latest.&#13;
Condition 2: the technology is not available locally. During the past two hun-&#13;
dred years technological innovations have been dominated by a handful of countries.&#13;
A study by O.E.C.D. (1970) identified 110 significant innovations in the twentieth&#13;
century. All emanated from developed countries with the U.S. responsible for&#13;
60%, the-U.K. 14% and German firms 11%. As'these figures indicate innovations are&#13;
not evenly spread among developed countries, but largely concentrated on a very&#13;
few countries. Only the U.S. and the U.K. are net creditors in terms nf rnyp1ty&#13;
paywents. Th U.S. accounted for nearly two thirds of the gross receipts of royalty&#13;
payments among the major recipientsl/ in 1977; the main European countries accounted&#13;
1/ From the data fund of the I.M.F. Countries included are the U.S., Japan U.K.,&#13;
Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, Australia,&#13;
S. Africa, New Zealand, Nonay, Finland and Spain.  As a group) these countries&#13;
are in credit Mo the rest of the world, in terms of royalty payments, to&#13;
the tune of 1,065 million SDRs.  The U.S.' own net credit Is far greater&#13;
than this - 3,662 milliosn SRDs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
for nearly 30%, and Japan for 3%. "hese figures reflect the past history of&#13;
technological domination by a few developed countries. But much of this domi-&#13;
nation remains. The developed countries are responsible for 97% of world re-&#13;
search and development expenditure-,.  6 nations-/ employ nearly 70% of the&#13;
world's research and development manpower and spend nearly 85% of R and D funds;&#13;
only 6% of an estimated 3 1/2 million patents issued in 1972 were granted by&#13;
developing countries, and less than one sixth of those issued by developing&#13;
countries were owned by developing country nationals.  -/ With the exception&#13;
of Brazil and India, developing countries import a high proportion of their&#13;
4/&#13;
capital goods- ; over 90% of LDC plant and machinery imports come from developed&#13;
countries. In recent years there has been some increase in the technological&#13;
capacity of developing countries - an increase which, as is to be expected, has&#13;
been unevenly spread among developing counitries. This is indicated by rising&#13;
expenditure on research and development and, by some evidence of incipient ex-&#13;
5/&#13;
ports of technology by some developing countries; and by increases in the export&#13;
6/&#13;
of capital goods by some developing countries.-  But while these developments&#13;
are potentially significant, particularl, in relation to policy, they are of&#13;
relative insignificance in the general picture. The developed countries retain&#13;
a massive preponderance in technological innovation which is a fundamental&#13;
fact which must underly any discussion of technology transfer: it is this pre-&#13;
ponderance that is sonetimes described as technological dependence.-/&#13;
1- Annerstadt (1978). Expenditure figures are a bit misleading because of dif-&#13;
ferences in salary levels: developing countries account for 13% of world&#13;
scientists and engineers involved in research and development.&#13;

Despite the fact that most innovations occur in the developed countries, there&#13;
are - to an increasing extent - local LDC sources of technology. In the first&#13;
place, although small in relative extent, R. and D. in the third world is in-&#13;
creasing, and third world innovat:ion (which extends, as in all economies, well&#13;
beyond formal R. and D.) and adaptation is rising.-/Secondly, when a certain&#13;
technology has been transferred once, internal transfer - from the initial re-&#13;
cipient to other users - could, in theory replace international transfer. How-&#13;
ever, in practice both these potential sources of internal technology tend to&#13;
be underutilized in many countries. Much LDC R. and D. tends to be misdirected,&#13;
from the point of view of generating usable technologies.- /A considerable por-&#13;
tion of it is basic research, which nlay be necessary to build up a scientific&#13;
capacity, but which many observers believe has been overemphasized. Moreover,&#13;
there are weak links between R. and D. and local productive activities, with a&#13;
notoriously small proportion of total R. and D. being conducted by firms.- /It&#13;
is noteworthy that of five countries which have developed Technology Plans, four&#13;
specified explicitly that a significant weakness of existing efforts was weak&#13;
links with the productive sector.-4  Evei. where local research efforts do gen-&#13;
erate viable technologies, there is a strong/ tendency for these technologies&#13;
to be rejected in favour of foreign sources.  This rejection is largely due to&#13;
1/  The five countries which have Technology Plans are all planning to raise the&#13;
proportion of GNTP devoted to R. and D; significantly, to around 1%.  Most re-&#13;
cent figures collected by Annerstadt show a significant increase in R. and D.&#13;
expenditure in LDCs in 1973 as compared with earlier figures,  Adaption and&#13;
innovntion have been identified in Korea and Taiwan (see Ranis 1972 and 1973),&#13;
and in Argentina(see Katz (1978) and Maxwell (1978)).  See also other sources&#13;
cited in Lall (1978). While a certain amount of LDC innovation has by now been&#13;
established its quantitative significance is not clear.&#13;

and Reddy in Bhalla (cd) (1979).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
the market power bestowed by foreign trademarks, which is in turn engendered by&#13;
consumer belief that foreign 's best, and bv some bad experiences with local&#13;
technclogies.  Foreign technologies mav elso involve a greater marketability on&#13;
world markets, and in some case access to markets which have been cartelized by&#13;
foreign sources.   The second potential source of internal technology is the&#13;
internal transfer of techniques which have been initially imported. Both Japan&#13;
and China have pursued this as a conscious policy. In the inter-war period,&#13;
Japanese technology policy was summarized by the slogan:  "The first machine by&#13;
import, the second by domestic production".    In China, Baranson reports that&#13;
a UL.S. "process team was shown an ex.ct duplicate of its own - albeit, an eight-&#13;
year old model - catalytic cracker and platforming refinery of a 3,000-barrel-&#13;
a-day capacity apparently copied from one that UOP had previously sold to Cuba".&#13;
(p. 118). But Japan and China are exceptions. Until recently many countries&#13;
haVe followed a laisser-faire policy towards the import of techn-logy permitting&#13;
the duplicative import of technology. Restrictions in technology contracts limit&#13;
the possibility of internal transfer, while it is often in the interests of the&#13;
individual firm to acquire a foreign technology from the original foreign source,&#13;
despite the fact (or indeed because of it) that some other local firm has already&#13;
acquired it. Thus empirical investigations find that very similar technologies&#13;
are sold to the same country a number of times, and sometimes that the identical&#13;
2/&#13;
technology is sold a number of times. A study of DanislTforeign investment in&#13;
India found that every single technique transferred was already in use somewhere&#13;

in India. The potential internal sources of technology a-e thus underused and the&#13;
extent of international transfer exaggerated, as a result of a laisser-faire&#13;
policy towards the transfer of technology, and the market power bestowed by&#13;
foreign technology.&#13;
Condition 3:  decision makers believe it is cheaper to import the technology&#13;
rather than reproduce it locally. Despite the real costs involved in technology&#13;
transfer, costs of local reproduction - particularly at the level of the in-&#13;
dividual firm - are likely to be greater. This is in part due to the lower&#13;
levels of technical sophistication and of R. and D. capacity in LDCs as com-&#13;
pared with DCs, and in large part to economies of scale associated with R. and&#13;
D., and particularly with its use.  Thus it is not surprising that once a parcicu-&#13;
lar technology has been developed, the reduplication of the development process&#13;
should be. more expensive than acquiring it. Moreover, given that many inves-&#13;
tors wish to acquire the marketing rights as well as the knowledge, and that lo-&#13;
cal R. and D. cannot generate this, foreign technology may be bought even when&#13;
local reproduction would be as cheap.&#13;
The three conditions necessary for the international transfer of.tech-&#13;
nology are thus very often present in investment decisions in third world countries&#13;
This is particularly the case when the market situation is such that foreign&#13;
trademarks enhance profitability, and governments pursue a passive policy&#13;
towards technology imports.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
II. Transfer Mechanisms&#13;
Defining technology I/ very broadly to include all knowledge related&#13;
to econorm2ic activity naturally means that it encompasses a very wide range of&#13;
types of knowledge, and that there are, correspondingly, very many mechanisms&#13;
of transfer associated with it. In content, technology includes knowledge about&#13;
infrastructure and services, agriculture as well as industry; it includes speci-&#13;
fication of what is produced as well as how it is produced. The how of pro-&#13;
duction is not merely a matter of technical specifications but also includes&#13;
managerial techniques, forms of organization and so on.&#13;
Much technology is transferred informally - through reading books,&#13;
journals, sales literature, through personal contacts in meetings and conferences&#13;
and so on and through th2 movement of trained people from one job to another.&#13;
Within more formal categories of transfer, a distinction has been made2/ between&#13;
direct and indirect mechanisms: direct mechanisms are those used when the&#13;
recipient enterprises are in direct cont&amp;ct with the suppliers of technology;&#13;
indirect transfer occurs when a company in an advanced country plays an&#13;
intermediary role packaging the technology for the developed country. In&#13;
practice, this distidction is too firm: there are a large variety of types of&#13;
transfer involving varying degrees of packaging.&#13;
1/ The literature abounds with definitional discussions of exactly what is&#13;
involved in the process of technology transfer, and of the various elements in-&#13;
volved, e.g., the distinction into "general technology," "system-specific"&#13;
technology, "firms-specific-technology" and so on (Quinn 1969).  See the dis-&#13;
cussion in Cooper and Sercovich (1971). Here we avoid this type of discussion.&#13;
2/ Cooper and Sercovich.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
Direct forms of transfer include direct contracting of individual experts&#13;
and consultant companies, engaging engineering design and plant construction&#13;
enterprises, training nationals for specific production prolects, technical&#13;
information activities and transfer of the process technology embodied in capital&#13;
goods bv importation of equipment purchased directly from machine manufacturers.-/&#13;
Indirect mechanisms range from the completely packaged in the form of dire(&#13;
investment overseas in a wholly-owned subsidiary, through joint ventures, turnkey&#13;
arrangements and license and management contracts between independent parties.&#13;
License agreements encompass a considerable range of contracts which vary&#13;
in what they cover, in the restrictive provisions involved, and in the form and&#13;
rate of payment. Some license agrer.-nents contain provisicns fcr some equity&#13;
participation; some include management contracts, or the right of the licensor&#13;
to appoint managers and/directors; licensors may sometimes appoint quality control&#13;
experts, and occasionally control marketing throubh wholly-owned subsidiaries.&#13;
License agreements often contain restrictive clauses in relation to the rights&#13;
of the licensee to export, to conduct and/or use independent research, and tie-in&#13;
clauses, whereby the licensee has to purrhase inputs from the licensor, and so on.-l&#13;
The determination of the mechaniism of transfer in a particular case&#13;
is the outcome of the willingness of the supplier of technology to supply the&#13;
technology in a particular form and the desire and ability of the recipient to&#13;
acquire it in a particular form. Generally, indirect mechanisms tend to be&#13;
adopted where a country lacks the capacity'to undertake direct purchase, where&#13;
proprietary technology is involved which *ill not be released, or where (for&#13;
marketing or other reasons) the recipient wishes to acquire trade marks.-3  But,&#13;
1/ Cooper and Scrcovich.&#13;
2/ Cooper and Scrcovich provide a comprehensive discussion.  A considerable mnuount&#13;
of researclh has been done examining the nature of transfer mechanisms in par-&#13;
ticular countries - see e.g., UNCTADI(3975a), Asian Productivity Organization&#13;
(1976), S.P.R.U. (1972)., IJNCrAD (1974), Mtarga Institute (1975), Sercovich (1974),&#13;
Vaitsos (1974).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- !.3 -&#13;
as just suggested, there remains considerable choice as zo the nature of the&#13;
indirect mechanism.&#13;
W4here the interests of the rec4pient country differ from those&#13;
of an individual recip-ent enterprise, the outcome may depend on who is responsible&#13;
for the negotiations - government or enterprise - and how far enterprise freedom&#13;
is restricted by government regulations.&#13;
The quantitative signilficance of different mechanisms varies as&#13;
between countries, as between industries, and over time. Country variation,&#13;
illustrated in the Table below for 1970, is partly a matter of national policy&#13;
towards technology transfer and private overseas investment, and partly of the degree&#13;
of development, and in particular the technological and managerial sophistication&#13;
of the country concerned. The less developed - in terms of this type of sophistica-&#13;
tion rather than per-capita income - the more packaged the transfer is likely to be.&#13;
because the country may lack the capacity to put the package together itself, and&#13;
because it may lack the bargaining power to insist on so doing.-/ But independently&#13;
of stage of development, the question of aLational technology strategy is of critical&#13;
importance: some countries, such as Japan and many of the socialist countries,&#13;
only permitted license agreements or direct transfers; many others have encouraged&#13;
1/ But, taking the ratio of intra-firm tQ total technology payments to U. S.&#13;
companies as a guide to the degree of packaging, in 1976 developed countries'&#13;
packaging (with the exception of Japan) was not dissimilar to that of the&#13;
developing countries (see footnote, p. 18). This may in part be due to the&#13;
non-regulatory/interventionist policies of most developed market economies&#13;
permitting packaged transfers. It also may be due to the fact that as&#13;
countries become more developed, the technology they need to acquire from&#13;
overseas becomes more sophisticated, and the tendency for packaging in&#13;
sophisticated industries to be greater than in less sophisticated outweighs&#13;
the effects of greater technological sophistication in reducing packaging.&#13;
&#13;

direct foreign investment; I/ while a few follow an intermediate policy&#13;
(e.g., India).21 The content of licensing agreements also varies between&#13;
countries: as is to be expected, countries with little independent managerial&#13;
capacity are likely to have agreements which include management contracts.&#13;
This was illustrated in a study of technology transfer to Ethiopia,-/ which&#13;
found that the majority of agreements contained management contracts.&#13;
The nature of the transfer mechanism adopted varies with the industry.&#13;
The more technologically sophisticated, the more difficult it is for countries&#13;
to rely on direct transfer. The extent and nature of property rights over&#13;
technology vary with the industry, as does the significance of trademarks.    UNCTAD&#13;
(1975a)  classified industries into "modern" (requiring heavy research and develop-&#13;
ment and with a recent record of tetchnological innovation), "traditional" and&#13;
"other" - both of which use well-established technologies.  They found that for&#13;
13 countries, 57% of the contractual arrangements were in the "modern" classifica-&#13;
tion in manufacturing, but there was a wide dispersion between countries. Relatively&#13;
sophisticated countries, like South Korea, had as much as 80% of contractual&#13;
arrangemeents in the modern industries, presumably indicating that direct transfer&#13;
occurs in mature industries with well-established technologies; but in Dahcmey,&#13;
80% of contracts were outside the research intensive sectors.  A comparative&#13;
study of pharmaceuticals, chemicals and electrical engineering in Latin America 4/&#13;
found significant differences in preferences of supplying firms for different&#13;
mechanisms of transfer. Broadly, these differences in preference were reflected&#13;
in the actual arrangements. In the pharmaceutical industry, there was a strong&#13;
preference for transfer via wholly-owned subsidiaries, and also for patent&#13;

protection of the technology transferred. In chemlcr.ls, the majority of firms&#13;
preferred joint ventures or pure licensing arrangements - the preference being&#13;
greater the smaller the size of the supplying firm. In electrical machinery -&#13;
which on the whole is a mature technology which has been widely dispersed - by far&#13;
the largest nuamber of preferences was for licensing agreements. In a study of metal&#13;
working and chemical firms in three Andear Pact countries, Mytelka (1978) distinguis-:.&#13;
between technology transfer via licensing and direct acquisition through experience&#13;
of personnel, non-negotiable means (e.g., copying), the purchase of machinery and&#13;
processes, journals end professional meetings.  "Ownership structure, product&#13;

sector and firm size...correlated highly with the decision to license."&#13;
Foreign firms clustered in industrrEs with complex and volatile technologies; they&#13;
together with mixed firms overwhelmingly licensed their technology, even wilere&#13;
the technologies were simple and mature.  Nationally-owned firms were domninant&#13;
in simpler (technologically) industries: 61% of nationally-owned firms acquired&#13;
technology through direct means, as compared with 17.6% of foreign firms, 12.5%J&#13;
of State firms and 25% of mixed fi-ms.  The firms were asked why they decided&#13;
to license:  51% gave braLvd name acquisition as a reason; 47% the complexity of&#13;
the technology, 30% prior L elationship to the technology supplier, 26% cheapness,&#13;
and 17% 'other' which in(ludes advanLageous bargaining conditions, reduced costs,&#13;
few restrictions. Returning to the earlier distinction between that part of&#13;
technology transfer which eonsists in the communication of useful knowledge,&#13;
and marketing rights aspects, it appears that for this sample,of the total&#13;
reasons given, one-third v!.-e of the knowledge communication typ' (complexity and&#13;
cheapness), while twe- th:, i, were other reasons, much of which could be classified&#13;
as marketing rights.   Iziis does not mean, of course, that licenses obtained for&#13;
e.g., brand name reasons, did not bring with them useful knowledge and quality&#13;
guarantees which it would have been costly to obtain in other ways.&#13;
A study of sources of technology in S. Korea -/ found that formal&#13;
mechanisms of transfer - licenses and te.hnical agreements with foreign&#13;
technology suppliers - accounted for ornly a small proportion of tne total.&#13;
Form,al mechamisms from foreign suppliers were of greatest significance in the&#13;
modern sector - accounting for 21% of all important technology sources. This is a&#13;
smaller proportion than other sources of foreign technology, which included tech-&#13;
nology embodied in Korean labour anad rNanagement (18.6%), foreign suppliers of&#13;
capital equtipment or raw materials (8.2°') and foreign buyers (6.6Z). In&#13;

the traditional and resource based sectors formal mechanisms played a sig-&#13;
nificantly smaller role.  While there may be special factors in S. Korea&#13;
accounting for some of the importance of informal mechanisms - for example,&#13;
buyers can only play a significant role in an export-oriented economy - the&#13;
study suggests we may often o"leremphasize the role of formal mechansims in&#13;
technology transfer.&#13;
In recent years, there have been various forces making for less packaged&#13;
forms of transfer - both in recipient and supplying countries. Growing industrial&#13;
sophistication among recipients has increased their capacity to provide elements&#13;
of the package for themselves; but they have also moved into more sophisticated&#13;
(technologically) industries, where packaging is more dominant. Increasing&#13;
political and economic sophistication, combined with the accumulation and spread&#13;
of knowledge about the technology transfer process, has increased countries'&#13;
intervention in technology transfer, sometimes involving a search for unpackaged&#13;
alternatives. -/ In some of the supplying countries, government regulations&#13;
curtailing investment overseas, and fears of the riskiness of overseas investment&#13;
in the light of moves among recipients to reduce equity participation, have&#13;
contributed to more arms length forms of technology transfer. 2/&#13;
The evidence, however, is rather mixed. Baranson claims that "the&#13;
most dramatic of the new strategies has been the adoption by some U. S. firms&#13;
of an explicit policy to shift from equity investment and managerial control&#13;
of overseas facilities to the sale of technology and management services as a&#13;
direct means to earn returns on corporate assets." 3/  He cites examples in five&#13;
major research-intensive industries. In the parts of the world where policies&#13;
have been most explicitly directed against packaged forms of technology inflow,&#13;
1/ See UNIDO (1978) and Mytelka (1977).&#13;
2/ Baranson (1978) discusses the reasons, particularly from the point of view of&#13;
the supplying countries, at greater length.&#13;

e.g. India and the Andean Pact Countries, there is evidence of a move towards&#13;
less packaged forms. 1/ But as Table 2 shows for the world as a whole, and&#13;
for developing countries other than Latin America, there has been a significa-nt&#13;
2/&#13;
increase in the proportion of U. S. technology receipts which are intra-firm.&#13;
Tlih  U. S. accounLed for 7:?2 of gross receipts for technology among the U. S.,&#13;
Japan and Europe in 1969; the proportion has declined to 68% in 1977. 3/&#13;
It appears that U. S. technology supplies are more often intra-firm than supp:ies&#13;
from other countries. 4/&#13;
No definite conclusions can be drawn on the basis of this evidence -&#13;
which is not surprising, perhaps, given the many factors that contribute to the&#13;
overall breakdown, including recipient country policy, industrial composition,-5/&#13;
6/&#13;
country source of supplies, etc. But it does appear that there are a range or&#13;
alternative mechanisms for technology transfer in many industries.&#13;
l/ See Mytelka (1977).&#13;
2/ As disctussed in detail below, royalty payments are not necessarily an accurate&#13;
guide to payments for technology transfer.  Over time, changes in the envirron.:ent&#13;
may leac' companies to change the form (proportionately) in which they receive&#13;
differel t forms of payment. This may be one explanation of the declining iatra-&#13;
firm raLio for Latin America, whlere the Andean Pact prohibited the payment of&#13;
royalties between subsidiary and parent companies.&#13;
3/ These figures are for receipts from technology transfer to all countries.&#13;
Evidence for payments by particular developing countries also suggests the&#13;
declining role of the U. S.:  for example, in South Korea, the U. S. accounted&#13;
for 40% of technology imports for the years 1962-66, and 217 in 1973-77; 'apj7&#13;
accounted for 33% in 1962-66 and 53% in 1973-77. In Peru, the U. S. and Canaca&#13;
accounted for 60% of the royalty payments in 1971 and 35% in 1974. A study of&#13;
license agreements in the Philippines for agreements hefore 1970, showed that&#13;
67% were with U. S. firms, 8% with Japanese firms; for the period 1971-73, 34%'&#13;
were with the U. S.  12% with  Japan. (UNIDO, 1978).&#13;
4/ This is suggested by the fact that intra-firm payments for particular countries&#13;
to all sources are substantial'ly lower than those shown for U. S.  payments:&#13;
e.g., for Brazil intra-fi-n payments aere 52% of total payments in manufacturing&#13;
1965-70; in Argentina they were 42% in 1972. (Chudnovsky 1978).&#13;

6/ Tlhe proportion of total. payments of royalties and management fees to U.-S.&#13;
companies, w7hich were int-ra-firm, rose sharply over the period 1960 to 1976&#13;
in the de.veloped countries, as well as the 'other developing':  In Japan,&#13;
it rose from  13 to 50%, in the U.K., from  56  to 84%', in Western Europe,&#13;

III. Significant Dimensions of Technology Transfer&#13;
Objectives of LDCs in relation to technology transfer have evo)vpt4&#13;
in response to experience in relation to technology transfer over the last 2c years.&#13;
Initially, keen to industrialize rapidly and thereby, as they thought, acquire&#13;
wealth and economic independence, most countries main aim was to maximize the&#13;
quantity of technology transferred. Hence, they introduced a host of incenti:.es,&#13;
such as tax incentives, duty drawbacks, protection, and the provision of infra-&#13;
structure, designed to encourage the inflow of technology from overseas, main.l&#13;
in the form of private overseas investment. -/  In other respects, a broadl-y&#13;
laisser faire policy was followed with respect to technology transfers so that it&#13;
was left to individual firms to decide the form and nature of the technology&#13;
transferred. However, as the consequences of unrestricted inflow became apparent,&#13;
new objectives evolved: the laissf,r-faire policy has therefore given way to a&#13;
much more interventionist strategy at both national and international levels.&#13;
First, the high and rising cost of technology transfer drew attention&#13;
to the neet to introduce policies which would improve the terms of technology&#13;
transfer.  This was initiated by the Andean Pact group of countries, then UNC:A.D, a,:&#13;
by now the need for policies in this area has gained very wide acceptance amo=g&#13;
LDCs.&#13;
Secondly, in many countries a dualistic pattern of development was&#13;
associated with the unrestricted import of advanced country technology. The&#13;
capital intensity of the investment, the heavy underemployment, and the elitist&#13;
1/ See Lent (1967), Reuber (1973) and U.N. (1972) for a description of the ir.-&#13;
centives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
consumpcicn patterns  :n many counttie3 led to emphasis on the need for appropriate&#13;
technology:  i.e., tecinology In line with the needs and reso'irces of poor&#13;
countries.  Although the need for appropriate technology was largely 4nit±aced&#13;
in the advanced countries, it has achieved increasing support among LDCs.&#13;
Thirdly, the dependency school of development suggested that neither&#13;
political independence nor industrialization was sufficient to achieve economic&#13;
independence, and that at the root of the dependency relationship exhibited between&#13;
periphery and center lay technological dependence. A more modest approach. which&#13;
does not rest on acceptance of the whole dependency analysis, shows that techno-&#13;
logical dependence did indeed impose restrictions on the freedom of decision&#13;
making that were scarcely compatible with economic independence. Hence, the&#13;
creation of independent technological capacity became an aim.&#13;
Fourthly, it was increasingly felt that unrestricted imrort of techno-&#13;
logy inhibited the development of local technological capacity which in turn&#13;
reduced long-run development prospects and engendered further technolcgicaL&#13;
dependence.&#13;
The new' objectives towards technology transfer, which have been&#13;
accepted and pursued with varying degrees af enthusiasm, are in many ways in&#13;
conflict with the initial objective of maximizing the inflow.  /  They each&#13;
suggest a much more interventionist policy on the part of governments, and in&#13;
general a more restrictive and selective policy towards technology transfer from&#13;
abroad. They each support (from different points of view) the need to develop&#13;

for Appropriate Technology." (1978).&#13;

Third World technological capacitv. In other respects, the new objectives are&#13;
sometimes in conflict, and often d±ffer 4n emphasis and policy,r conclusions.&#13;
In the rest of chis paper, we examine the policy opcicns indicated by the new&#13;
objectives.  The paper takes four d±mensions of technology transfer:&#13;
1. the terms of the transfer, or the cost;&#13;
II.  the effects of che transfer on 'ndeoendence of d4ecision nak4ng;&#13;
III.  the effects of the transfer on local technological capacity, or the&#13;
learning effects of the transfer; and&#13;
IV. the characteristics of the transfer.&#13;
Each of these corresponds with one of the 'new' objectives described.  The&#13;
paper considers past experience in relation to each of these dimensions, and&#13;
policy options suggested (and in some cases adopted).  The next sections consider&#13;
the first three dimensions, which are grouped naturally together in terms of&#13;
policy. The question of characteristics raises somewhat sep"rate issues and&#13;
is dealt with in Section VI.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23 -&#13;
IV. Costs of Technology Transfer&#13;
(i) Actual costs: It is difficult to ascertain actual costs of&#13;
transfer. Apart from the fact that data is weak and sparse, the packaged&#13;
aspect of much technology transfer and the indirect costs imposed raise&#13;
problems. Where there is any degree of packaging the supplying firm is,&#13;
by definition, supplying more than one service. This means that the firm&#13;
has some choice in how it receives its return for each element of the package -&#13;
e.g., whether it receives payment for technology as royalties, as profits,&#13;
or through the transfer pricing mechanism. Declared payments nominally&#13;
attributed to any one item may therefore bear no relationship to the real&#13;
charge levied. To get at the total charges levied is lifficult; but with&#13;
rough and ready means, estimates have been made. But this does not solve&#13;
the problem of how to allocate the items among the elements of the package.&#13;
This is peculiarly difficult in connection with technology transfer because&#13;
there is often some monopoly element involved, enabling the total charges levied to&#13;
exceed the competitive charges. But the source of monopoly is not always&#13;
the possession and sale of the technology; it may involve access to markets,&#13;
or raw materials or so on. However, if we define the technology transfer&#13;
to include marketing rights, as we have above, then it can be claimed that&#13;
in large part monopolistic charges may be attributed to the technology transfer.&#13;
But we should not include, as many seem to have done, competitive payments&#13;
for other services which form part of the package, as costs of technology&#13;
transfer.&#13;
These problems, that arise from the packaged nature of technology&#13;
transfer, are most acute for the most packaged torms of transfer - viz., that&#13;
of the TNC to wholly owned subsidiaries. But joint ventures also have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
considerable scope for manipulating payments. Wholly owned national&#13;
companies often receive technology and inputs from the same source -&#13;
again it is not possible to know to what extent particular forms of&#13;
payment represent the payment for technology.&#13;
A further problem is that restrictions on activIties form a&#13;
normal part of many technology contracts. But these impose costs, which&#13;
can be substantial.  For example, tied sources of inputs is similar to&#13;
tied aid in increasing costs, but worse because with aid tying normally&#13;
takes the form of tying to a particular country whereas with technology&#13;
transfer the tying is to a particular firm. Even for aid, the costs have&#13;
been estimated to be as much as 30% of the cost of the equipment. -  The&#13;
costs are likely to be greater for private technoloRy transfers. Other&#13;
forms of restriction also impose costs which are difficult to estimate, such&#13;
as restrictions on exports and on local innovation. The extent of these&#13;
restriction has been established by a number of studies, but not their&#13;
costs.&#13;
In view of these problems, it is perhaps not surprising that none&#13;
of the (quite numerous) studies on technology transfer to developing countries&#13;
have come up with satisfactory estimates of costs.&#13;
The most systematic estimates of direct costs were mrade Dy UNCTAD&#13;
(1975). For 1968, they estimated -that direct costs to LDCs of technology&#13;
transfer were around $1,500 million for royalties and consultancy payments,&#13;
which was equivalent to 5% of non-oil exports and around 0.5% of GDP. They&#13;
1/ Bhlagwati (1968).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
estimated that thiese payments were likelv to grow et around 20% p.a. on&#13;
the basis of questionnaires to recipient countries. However, the technology&#13;
receiving countries expected a lower rate of increase. If we assume that&#13;
in fact technology payments grew by 15-Zo p.a. from 1968-1977, they would&#13;
amount to  i5,Z75m. in l977.-   Table 1 shows the UNrUfAD estimates togerner&#13;
with technology related payments. As suggested above some element of these&#13;
related payments are likely to be due to technology.&#13;
In addition to these direct costs, overinvoicing of imports and&#13;
underi.voicing of exports represents an additional cost. The very substantial&#13;
proportion of international trade that occurs within the transnational corporation&#13;
gives scope to these practices.&#13;
1/ The data are derived from questionnaires to recipient countries. More&#13;
recent data collected by the IMF is too incomplete to provide much guidance.&#13;
It excludes management/consultancy and the coverage is very incomplete.&#13;
The estimates for royalties are far lower than those of UNCTAD (generally&#13;
of the order of 1/2% to 1% of exports). It is likely that a good deal of&#13;
intra-affiliate payments have been omitted in the IMF data.  However, the&#13;
Fund data suggest that the UNCTAD estimates overstate the costs. According&#13;
to the Fund data, gross royalty receipts among the main technology suppliers&#13;
from all countries grew by 99% p.a. between 1969 and 1977. Net receipts&#13;
grew by 10.9% p.a.&#13;

It is estimated that roughly one-third of total US exports were&#13;
on an intra-firm basis in 1970.1/ In manufacturing three industries accounted&#13;
for 70% of that trade: transport, equipment, non-electrical machinery and&#13;
chemicals. Fifty three percent of manufactured exports to developing countries&#13;
was intra-firm, and for developing countries other than Latin America the&#13;
proportion was 65%.2/  Intra-firm trade is here defined as trade between&#13;
a parent and a majority-owned affiliate. If joint ventures were included&#13;
the proportion would be higher. A detailed study of Brazil and Mexico showed&#13;
that the intra-firm share of exports was high and growing: in 1960 it was 68% and&#13;
54% respectively; in 1972, 73% and 82%.-/ Imports from the parent company&#13;
accounted for 50% (Brazil) and 58% (Mexico) of the affiliates' total material&#13;
imports in 1972. Again, intra-firm trade was found to be particularly concentrated&#13;
in technologically sophisticated industries. For the UK, a survey suggested&#13;
that about one-quarter of all exports were intra-firm, and one-quarter of&#13;
recurrent imports of affiliates in developing countries were supplied by other&#13;
units within the corporation.  Data for Norway and German firms also show a&#13;
significant proportion of trade is intra-firm; generally speaking the proportions&#13;
(of both imports and 2xports) are lower than for US firms.-/&#13;
1/  Lall (1973) and UiCTAD (1977c) summarize the evidence.&#13;

The evidence thus shcws that a very significant proportion of trade&#13;
is intra-firm, giving rise to the possibility of a quantitatively significant&#13;
element of costs of technology transfer being disguised through the manipulation&#13;
of transfer pricing.   Intra-firm trade tends to be highest in the&#13;
technologically sophisticated firns where the costs of technology transfer&#13;
are likely to be greatest. Intra--firm trade appears to be of substantially&#13;
greatest significance for US companies. However, the US is by far the largest&#13;
source of technology transfer, although its predominance is declining.l/&#13;
The existence of a high proportion of intra-firm trade is necessary but not&#13;
sufficient to indicate the existencL of transfer price manipulation as a&#13;
sizeable source of income transfer between countries.  There are obvious&#13;
difficulties in getting hard evidence on the existence and extent of such&#13;
practices. But a growing body of evidence has now acctimulated2! showing that&#13;
in some industries, it forms a significant element in internaticial income&#13;
flows.&#13;
One approach has been tc, try t:' establish the extent of such practices&#13;
indirectly by regression estimates. Kopits (1976b) found he was able to explain&#13;
the breakdown of income transfers as between royalties and transfer payments,&#13;
statistically, by the tax incentives for the different types of remittances.&#13;
But he was primarily concerned with developed countries.  An econometric analysis&#13;
of export prices in Latin America suggested underpricing of exports of, on&#13;
average, 40% of the value of exports.3/ Other indirect evidence has been less&#13;
conclusive.&#13;

Direct estimates have been obtained by comparing J.ntra-firm prices with&#13;
-market prices. Detailed studies have been done for Colombia and Greece - when&#13;
the government instituted machinsry to check on transfer pricing practices of&#13;
international firms. In Colombia between 1967 and 1970, overpricing was great-&#13;
est in pharmaceuticals - "the absolute amount of overpricing for the foreign&#13;
firms studied amounted to a figure of six times their royalties and 24 times&#13;
their declared profits':-/ overpricing was greatest for the pharmaceutical&#13;
industry, (on average 155%) where the fereign exchange losses due to overpricing&#13;
of inputs were estimated to be as great as the total industrial royalties paid&#13;
by all industrial sectors for technology. In electrical goods overpricing was&#13;
estimated to be 54%, in rubber goods 44%, and chemicals 25%.&#13;
In Greece-/ two groups of products were studied.  In metals, metal products&#13;
and minerals a sample investigation showed overpricing of imports of between 5&#13;
and 88%, with a weighted average of 19.4%; for chemicals the range was between&#13;
12 1/2 and 229%, with a weighted average of 34.5%. In the first group of prod-&#13;
ucts 95% of the underpricing was the responsibility of foreign owned firms; in&#13;
the chemicals groups it was all in the foreign owned firms. For the mineral&#13;
-product group the total foreign exchange cost was estimated to be about 2 1/2&#13;
times the size of declared profits. The Greek study also investigated&#13;
three export products and found underpricing ranging from 8.3% to 16.9%. The&#13;
extent of underpricing was equivalent to 35% of the preceding year's profits for&#13;
a 90% foreign owned firm, 26% for a joint venture and 13% for a locally owned&#13;

firm with foreign connections.&#13;
Evidence of substantial underpricing of imports in the pharmaceutical in-&#13;
dustry has been obtained in India, Ecuador, Peru and Chile.-/  The evidence for&#13;
extensive use of transfer pricing to secure international income flows has been&#13;
long established in the petroleum industry. -2&#13;
The evidence collected so far indicates that transfer pricing forms a&#13;
significant source of international income flows in intra-firm transactions -&#13;
at least as great as declared royalities and often as great as declared profits.&#13;
While the evidence, in terms of cotutry coverage and of magnitude, is grea,est for&#13;
the pharmaceutical industry, the practices are not confined to this industry but&#13;
extend (in lesser amount) to all irLdustries examined, such as rubber and mineral&#13;
products, as cited above. In view of the strong incentives that firms face to&#13;
3/&#13;
price in these ways (which include the tax system and restrictions on remittances-&#13;
the results are not surprising.&#13;
It is difficult to assess with fairness and accuracy how far these prac-&#13;
tices inflate the costs of technology transfer - partly because the evidence&#13;
though growing is still very incomplete, and partly because, as alre..dy suggested,&#13;
it is difficult to know how much of' the additional cost should be attributed&#13;
to technology transfer and how much to other factors. However, without trying to&#13;
form an accurate estimate certain conclusions follow:  first, the declared&#13;
royalty payments cannot be taken as a guide to the costs of technology transfer.&#13;
Some element of the income transferred as overinvoiced imports/underinvoiced&#13;
exports should also be attributed to technology transfer. In so far as it is&#13;
technological dominance (including marketing rights aspects) which gives rise&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
to the market domination of a few firms and the possibility of transfer price&#13;
manipulation, then it is correct to -attribute the inxcome so transferred in&#13;
large part to the process of technology transfer. Secondly, the form or mechanism&#13;
of the technology transfer influences the extent to which this sort of inter-&#13;
national income transfer is possible. Manipulation of transfer prices can only&#13;
occur, in fully fledged form,-where trade is intra-firm. But some possibilities&#13;
exist in less packaged forms than the wholly owned subsidiary. Joint ventures,&#13;
indeed, may have as great a possibility, and a greater (at least from the point&#13;
of view of the foreign partner) reason for transferring income in this way. But&#13;
the (limited) evidence suggests that joint ventures pay slightly less for inputs&#13;
than wholly owned subsidiaries.-   .ae possibilities are clearly less for locally&#13;
owned firms, but even here where they have strong connections with overseas firms,&#13;
or where purchases of inputs (and/or access to markets for output) are effectively&#13;
tied to the foreign firm, part of the costs of technology transfer may appear as&#13;
inflated prices of imported inputs. However, both a priori reasoning, and the&#13;
limited empirical evidence on this, suggest that the more packaged the transfer&#13;
mechanism, the greater the flow of interiational income that occurs via transfer&#13;
pricing. Thirdly, irrespective of the total sums involved, the existence of&#13;
sizeable international income flows associated with technology transfer, in the&#13;
form of transfer price manipulations, suggests a number of directions for policy.&#13;
These will be discussed below.&#13;
Indirect costs   as already indicated the process of technology transfer often&#13;
imposes restrictions on the activities of recipient enterprises which impose real,&#13;
albeit indirect, costs. In the case of wholly owned subsidiary these restric-&#13;
tions are often implicit. But in transfers between less closely associated&#13;
enterprises, they are explicit elements in technology contracts.-/&#13;
I/ Stopford and Wells (1972) p. 161 - 162&#13;
21  UNCTAD (1975a) found that in both India ana the knilippines provision for&#13;
tied purchase of inputts was substantially greater in technology transfer&#13;
between indcpendcnt enterprises (20Z in India, 58% in the Plillippines) than&#13;
between associated enterprises (10% for botlh wlholly owned subsidiaries and&#13;
minority equity in India; 9X for a wholly oxrned subsidiary and 25% minority&#13;
equity in Llte Philippines); (Table 6). Vaitsos (1971) found similar differencea.&#13;

Detailed studies of technology transfer have revealed that restrictions&#13;
1/&#13;
are             widespread.  The SPRU-study of Latin America found export restrictions&#13;

in 12 out of 19 firms in the pharmaceutical irdustry, 8 out of 10 companies&#13;

A study-/ of the Andean Pact countries experience showed that of contracts&#13;
examined 77% in Bolivia, 77% in Colombia, 75% in Ecuador and 89% in Peru con-&#13;
tained a complete export prohibition. For nationally owned firms the per-&#13;
centage which prohibited exports was 92%.- No major differences were found be-&#13;
tween sectors.&#13;
The effect on countries' export potential varies with industrial strategy&#13;
and the type of technology transfer as well as the strategy of the technology sup-&#13;
plier. While these studies found significant export restrictions, technology&#13;
transfer associated with multinational companies provides access to export mar-&#13;

The study of the Andean Pact group of papers showed that tie-in clauses&#13;
were experienced in all sectors st:udied, but were greatest in the pharmaceutical&#13;
industry.&#13;
Adding up the costs: as already stated it is impossible to be accurate&#13;
because of lack of data and conceptual and theoretical problems in estimating&#13;
and attributing costs. However, it does seem clear that the overt charges for&#13;
technology transfer - royalty paymer,s etc. - are way below the total costs of&#13;
tie transfer.  For axdwple, to au6 13% of thie cubts uf importetu capital&#13;
equipment and chemicals and one fifth of declared profits on overseas investment to&#13;
the LTFCTAD estirates of rechnology costs would more than double the costs in IT6°&#13;
Fo 12 1/,r7 of non-petrolctTm exporits).  Yet in .-rew of the evidence on intra-firms&#13;
trade, transfer pricing practices, tied purchases of inputs, and *xport restrictions,&#13;
these additions are extremely modest.  For example, suppose we assume that tied&#13;
purchase of capital goods adds 30% to cost:s of capital equipment, as might be sug-&#13;
gested by the evidence on tied aid, then for countries with around three quarters&#13;
of their inputs tied by technology contracts, the additional cost would be over&#13;
twerty percent of the cost of capital equipment.&#13;
It would be interesting and useful to have accurate estimates of total costs,&#13;
but even without these, it is clear that the total cost is very significant, and&#13;
LDCs could make important foreign exchange savings if they were able to reduce&#13;
the cost of technology transfer.&#13;
1/ See eg. Helleiner (1973).&#13;
/ "One of the important differences between the two types of equity arrangement&#13;
appears to lie in the different access to export markets. The foreign con-&#13;
trolled subsidiary is more likely to be offered access to the global channels&#13;
of distribution of the -foreign firm than is a joint venture" Chudson (1974).&#13;
Some reasons and evidence is contained in Stopford and Wells (1972).&#13;

(ii)  The Appropriate Irice:  The market for technology is a&#13;
peculiar one - even within developed countries; peculiarities aze greater&#13;
in relation to technology transfer between developed and developing countries.&#13;
The marginal cost of supplying information that has already been developed,&#13;
are low:&#13;
"once new knowledge has been created it has the character of a public good,&#13;
in the sense that the use of such knowledge by one person does not preclude its&#13;
use by another so that optimality requires that it be made available to all poten-&#13;
tial users without charge" (Johnson)&#13;
However, since the costs of the initial research and development may be&#13;
substantial, marginal cost pricing would not provide enough incentive for its&#13;
development by the private sector. To this dilemma, two solutions are possible:&#13;
first, that the public sector should be responsible for, or subsidize, the pro-&#13;
duction of knowledge.  This raises problems in securing the necessary links with&#13;
users (problems widely encountered in developing countries, where much research&#13;
is publically financed); although experience with defence research suggests the&#13;
problems are not insuperable. The second solution is to provide leg..l and other&#13;
protection to the owners/developers of technology so that they may acquire some&#13;
monopolistic control over their technology, and consequently sell it at a price&#13;
above its marginal cost. This has been the system adopted for much technological&#13;
development in developed countries. It is often justified as necessary to secure&#13;
a continued flow of research and development. Essentially then with this system&#13;
the price charged for technology is a monopolistic/oligopolistic one. The non-&#13;
competitive pricing of technology can be viewed as a mechanism adopted by devel-&#13;
oped country firms to generate returns to innovative activity in an area where&#13;
competitive appropriability is low.&#13;
Developing countries have control over how they wish to finance or pro-&#13;
tect their own research, but in acquiring technology from abroad, they have to&#13;
accept the system as they find it. In this context it makes little sense to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
talk of the 'right', 'optimal' or 'appropriate' price. Two extreme positions&#13;
have been put forward. On the one hand, it is sometimes suggested that the develop-&#13;
ing countries are so marginal in relation to the technology sales of advanced&#13;
countries, that they should make a minimum or zero contribution to the research and&#13;
development costs of t.±e technology they acquire.-fOn the other hand, others have&#13;
suggested that even a small inroaLd into the current price of technology, will re-&#13;
duce the flow (the flow being variously interpreted as the flow of research and&#13;
development and/or the flow of technology transfer).2/ Both common sense and&#13;
evidence suggest that the latter position is Loo extreme. Developing countries,&#13;
taken as a whole, do provide a considerable portion of the expenses of technological&#13;
development, as evidenced by the costs summarized above. But they are normally&#13;
quite a way down the line, as users of new technology, frequently acquiring it not&#13;
from the first developers hut subsequent owners,-3  after a considerable time lag.&#13;
Sales to developing countries, then, probably form only a small part of the moti-&#13;
vation behind the development of most technologies. Another question is how far the&#13;
transfer, as against the development of technology would be affected by a reduced&#13;
price.  Tne answer to tiis 3s unknown - -here can be no single answer covering&#13;
all countries anu all industries, but the experience of countries which have tried&#13;
to bargain toughly sVggests a low supply elasticity.4/&#13;
An essential feature of the market for technology then is that it is non-&#13;
competitive; consequently there is considerable (extent unknown) area for bargain-&#13;
ing, as the price may vary between an upper limit determined by costs of repro-&#13;
ducing the technology and a lower limit determined by costs of imparting the in-&#13;
formation. The important potential role of policy arises from this indeterminacy,&#13;

Technology Transfer and Independence&#13;
Independence of decision making is valued in itself by some - hence&#13;
the resentment of foreign ownership of a large proportion of a country's assets.&#13;
But it is also necessary for the achievement of other aims. Restrictions on&#13;
freedom of decision making tend to increase costs and reduce the firm's ability&#13;
to be selective about technological choice, and to learn and to generate an&#13;
independent technological capacity.&#13;
Independence of decision making is obviously absent in the case of wholly&#13;
owned subsidiaries of foreign companies. Nationalization of assets, joint ven-&#13;
tures and restrictions on the shares of equity that foreign compi-lies may&#13;
hold are policies that have been adopted in large part in order to preserve&#13;
independence of decision making. But close scrutiny of technology contracts of&#13;
joint ventures or national firms has revealed a very considerable degree of&#13;
restriction on independence of decision making. A typology of restrictions&#13;
was shown in Table 4.&#13;
Vaitsos' research in the Andean Pact showed - in addition to iestrictions&#13;
on exports and tie-in clauses already discussed - restrictions on prices, on volume&#13;
of sales, on quality control and on the sale of technology.-  A study-/ in Argen-&#13;
tina showed that licensing agreements with wholly locally owned firms included&#13;
clauses such as: source of inputs of machinery, materials, spare parts; prices&#13;
and quantity of output; export outlets permitted; restraints on the dymamic&#13;
effect of the transfer - e.g. non-transference of patents, restrictions on local&#13;
R and D.  Similar restrictions were found in a study of Indian firms.-/  For&#13;
example, 23 percent of the agreements examined involved some restrictions on local&#13;
sales (type, quantity, price) while over half involved restrictions on exports.4/&#13;

- 38-&#13;
Changing the ownership structure is thus insufficient to secure&#13;
independence of decision making. Indeed technology contracts have been&#13;
described as "a mechanism of control of the recipient firms." -/ Direct&#13;
purchase of technology, through, e.g., use of the experience of personnel,&#13;
purchase of machinery, copying imported products, avoids this sort of re-&#13;
striction. But for most countries, this is a possibility only for the&#13;
simpler products and techniques. As noted earlier, even emong the simpler&#13;
technologies, a tendency has been observed foi foreign owned and mixed firms&#13;
to purchase technologies via technology contracts.        A different approach -&#13;
now followed by an increasing number of countries-/ - is to outlaw restrictive&#13;
clauses. But outlawing cannot always ensure de facto elimination of the practices.&#13;

Learning Effects of Technology Tra sfer&#13;
The ability to make independent technological choices, to ada?t and&#13;
improve upon chosen techniques and products, and eventually to generate new&#13;
technology endogenously are essential aspects of the process of development.&#13;
The process may be described as the accumulation of technological capacity;&#13;
it is at least as important to economic development as the accumulation of&#13;
capital.&#13;
The accumulation of technological capacity is the outcome of a complex&#13;
series of forces. One significant element is 'learning by doing'; another is&#13;
an educational, infrastructural and institutional setting which both permits&#13;
and encourages the learning process. Both aspects are crucial, although in&#13;
the past policy has tended to overemphasize the institutional side, which is&#13;
most obviously amenable to government policy, and underestimate the 'learning&#13;
by doing' side. Weak links between an elaborate institutional structure and&#13;
industrial and learning by doing activities have tended to 'marginalize' the&#13;
1/&#13;
activities of the scientific institutions.-&#13;
The accumulation of technological capacity is not a simple, easily&#13;
described activity. It cannot be measured in a straight forward way at either&#13;
macro ur micro levels. At a macro-level, residual methods of measuring technical&#13;
change, suggest the substantial significanice of increases in productivity&#13;
which are not explained by increases in inputs. But these methods are highly&#13;
dubious because of the probleins of attributing increases in output to increases&#13;
in input. Moreover, in a developing country context they exaggerate the extent&#13;
of indigenously generated technological change, since in part the technical&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
change identified is due to improved imported techniques; on the other hand,&#13;
the measure in no way captures the development of independence of decision-&#13;
making which is an important element in the accumulation of technological&#13;
capacity. Micro-case studies throw more light on the process. Again, precise&#13;
measurement is not possible, but rmicro-studies of technological change do&#13;
pinpoint the significance of such change and also suggest the myriad causes.&#13;
Maxwell's study of a steel plant :Ln Argentina, for example, showed that&#13;
(endogencusly generated) technological change, was responsible for over half&#13;
the increase in output capacity. The causes of the technological change he&#13;
attributed to exogenously determined changes in demand (leading to the need&#13;
to diversify output), exogenously determined changed in operating conditions&#13;
(e.g., deterioration in the quality of available scrap), and endogenously&#13;
generated changes arising from routine activities of engineers, etc. The&#13;
exogenous causes were of the greatest significance. The form the technical&#13;
change took varied - from major changes in process, to minor changes in procedure.&#13;
The agents if the changes included people transfer from elsewlhere in Argentina,&#13;
the employment of foreign consultants and the firms'own engineering department.&#13;
There is a complex relationship between the import of technology&#13;
and the development of local technological capacity - one that encompasses&#13;
both conflicts and complementarities. The import of technology is a necessary,&#13;
or at the very least helpful, part of the learning process in many countries&#13;
and for many industries - either by providing an essential input into the&#13;
learning process or by pennitting the country to bypass the slow process of&#13;
reinventing the wheel. On the other hand, the unrestricted inflow of foreign&#13;
technology may severely inhibit the learning process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
The development of local t.chnological capacity may be roughly class'fied&#13;
as a three stage process. In the first stage, the capacity for independent -E;rch&#13;
and choice is developed; in the second, minor technical changes (which may add&#13;
up to major changes in terms of quantitative impact) are generated localvy-&#13;
the third, new technology is developed indigenously. The third stage is unl'.:ely&#13;
to occur unless the f'irst two are well established. Different types of capacity&#13;
are necessary for each of the stages; in the first two entrepreneurial and&#13;
engineering capacity are required rather than formal R. and D., while formal '.&#13;
and D. may be necessary, in many cases, for the generation of new technology.&#13;
Government policy which has concentrated on formal R. and D. in government&#13;
financed research laboratories has tended to neglect the first two stages al:'.ough&#13;
they are necessary precursors to the effective use of the results of the for-.al&#13;
R. and D.&#13;
The impact of foreign teLcnology inflow is likely to be different&#13;
according to the stage reached, local scientific and technological capacity,&#13;
the form w'iich the foreign technology iniflow takes, and the industry concerned.&#13;
Unregulated technology inflow in packaged form may inhibit or delay&#13;
each stage, but part..cularly stages 1 and 3. Yet, some import of technology&#13;
is likely to be an essential input to each stage.&#13;
In relation to stage 1 - the capacity for independent technological choice -&#13;
use of foreign technology, in packaged form, tends to lidit independent choice.&#13;
In the case of wholly-owned subsidiaries, decisions about choice of techniques&#13;
remain those of the foreign company. Where technology is licensed, there is&#13;
more freedom of choice but, as is to be expected, the parent company (of mixed&#13;
firms), or the licensor determines the source of machinery to be used in mary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
cases. -/  Limitations on decision making, which as already described form&#13;
part of many technology contracts, limit the freedom to make a choice and&#13;
consequently the possibility of learning how to do so. The effects are not&#13;
confined to the immediate decision covered by the licence but tend to carry&#13;
forward to the next set of decisions: thus, Mytelka found that firms that licensed&#13;
their technology were overwhelmingly likely to expect that they would acquire&#13;
future technology in the same form. In contrast, and not surprisingly, firms&#13;
that acquired technology by direct means -/  generally were expected to be able&#13;
to generate new technology in the siL-e way.&#13;
The second stage of accumulation of technological capacity - minor&#13;
changes and adaptations generated locally - is largely unrelated to the extent&#13;
of foreign technology inflow. It oc:curs in response to local pressures for&#13;
adaptatior and change.  Imported tec:hnology may provide the basic technology&#13;
subject to thls kind of technologicaLl change.  Local changes are generated as a re-&#13;
sult of the need to expand and diversify output, and in response to cost pressures.&#13;
Bot] Kntz and MRxb.T11 show.r s1.9nificant changes of this type occurring in subsidia-&#13;
ric!s of maultinational companies, 0.ere the basic technology was imported.  The&#13;
changes reqouired a certain initial engineering capacity, but in turn the&#13;
learning process generated through the changes created additional technological&#13;
capacity.  We have much too little evidence on change of this type to know&#13;
whether there is any systematic relationship with quantity or form of technology&#13;
transfer, any systematic relationship with competitive environment (national&#13;

or with other variables.  Nor can we say, at this point, how far the results&#13;
are cumulative leading to acceleratir;g technical change of this type, to the&#13;
2/&#13;
next stage of technological development, or to technology exports.-&#13;
The third stage - generation of new techniques - is likely to be&#13;
inhibited by weaknesses in the earlier stages. One outcome of weakness in&#13;
decision making capacity is inability to generate technology autonomously.3/&#13;
To some extent, development of local technological capacity is an infant&#13;
industry, requiring protection from outdide competition it it is to be established.&#13;
The free import of technology inhibits its development in a number of ways: it&#13;
provides a reliable (and sometimes relatively cheap) source of technology as&#13;
compared with the risks of own development. These risks are not just scientific&#13;
ones, but include marketing risks. Techniques with a foreign trade-mark have&#13;
. m0ic certain market compared with techniques developed indigenously. Formal&#13;
restric-tions on local development of technology and/or the use of locally-&#13;
develovpc:d techniques form part of some technology contracts.A4/ Most foreign-&#13;
owned firms prefer to rely on their central research and development laboratories,&#13;
and do not conduct R. and D. in the developing countries.5/ Recently, it has been&#13;
the policy of some large U.S. companies to shift some of their R. and D. overseas, 6&#13;
but the shift has been almost exclusively to developed countries.&#13;
1/ Sercovich (1978) has suggested that the extent of such change will depend in&#13;
part on the initial design (whether 'underdesigned' or 'overdesigned') which&#13;
in turn depends on initial conditions.&#13;
2/  Katz and Ahblin  (1978) suggest a sort of product cycle in technology: the&#13;
import of technology leads to the development of local technology in respcnse&#13;
to environmental pressures, and then to the export of technology to countries&#13;
with similar environments. They illustrate with a few cases in Argentina.&#13;
3/  Again, the Mytelka study supports this showing a close connection between&#13;
freedom of choice of machinery and a belief in the firms ability to generate&#13;
its own technology in future.&#13;
4/  See UNCTAD, (1975), TD/B/AC.ll/l0/Rev. 2, paras. 83-89.&#13;

Latin America.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
Sagasti reporting on the IDRC study of science and technology policy&#13;
instruments which included research in ten less developed countries, concludes&#13;
that "Although technology imports do not always hamper the growth of domestic&#13;
science and technology capabilities, the wholesale importation of technology&#13;
without efforts to screen, control and absorb it usually stunts the growth&#13;
of domestic science and technology capabilities." (My underlining)&#13;
While a selective approach to the import of technology may be necessary&#13;
to protect and encourage local technological development, positive, promotional&#13;
policies are also required. The most successful examples of technology promotion&#13;
have combined selective imports of foreign technology with many positive promotional&#13;
measures: at a macro-level Japan's policies provide a very good example. Micro&#13;
examples include PEMEX in Mexico and fertilizer developments in India.l/&#13;
It is clear that the appropriate set of policies will vary according to&#13;
the industry as well as local technological capacity. In some technologically&#13;
complex industries, most LDCs will need to continue to rely on imported technology&#13;
for some time, and at this stage are in a position only to learn to Lhoose and to&#13;
adapt in minor ways. In less complex industries, many countries may be in a&#13;
2/&#13;
position to generate technology themselves.-&#13;
;-&#13;
Giving special promotion (plus protection) to local technological&#13;
developments may involve (as with other such promotional policies) short run&#13;
costs, in terms of reduced eff'ciency. This is in part a question of the&#13;
1/ Roberts (1973)&#13;
2/ Cooper (1976) provides a classification of industries along these lines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
opportunity costs of the resources levoted to technological developments,&#13;
and in part of any inferiority of the local technology as compared with the&#13;
foreign alternative. Exclusive ise of promotional policies (with no restrictions&#13;
on foreign technology) will avoid the second kind of loss, but, it seems likelv,&#13;
at the cost of making local efforts more ineffective.&#13;
There are three different types of reason why countries may consider&#13;
these costs justified: first, because technological independence is an aim&#13;
in itself. Secondly, because there are externalities of local technological&#13;
developments which are not captured by the firm, but which benefit the economy&#13;
(e.g., as a result of the learning experience, which individuals take to other&#13;
firms). Thirdly, because short run losses are believed to be outweighed by&#13;
long run gains-/- the infant industry argument.&#13;
11 It must also be assumed that government objectives differ from those&#13;
of individual firras either because of externalities or because of attitude&#13;
towards time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

V.  Policies Towards the Import of Technology&#13;
Relevant policies vary according to the objective, but there is&#13;
considerable overlap: some instruments serve more than one objective, while&#13;
the objectives themseJves are interrelated and mutually enforcing. For&#13;
example, policies which increase independence also tend to improve bargain-&#13;
ing strength. The effectiveness of different policies depends in part on&#13;
the general economic strategy of the country; it also depends on other poli-&#13;
cies towards technology. This is particularly true with respect to the&#13;
promotion of local technological development, where policies towards foreign&#13;
technology are only a small part of the total effort needed.-/Relevant and&#13;
appropriate policies will vary according to the stage of development of the&#13;
country, its administrative and technological capacity, and according to&#13;
the industry.&#13;
As seen above, the free and unselective import of foreign tech-&#13;
nology has involved a high cost (clirectly and indirectly), has limited&#13;
independence of decision making and, to _ome extent, the learning effects&#13;
of the technology. Policies towards the import of technology are designed&#13;
to reduce these effects.-&#13;
Many of the policies considered below are primarily aimed at&#13;
reducing the cost of imported technology:, this may be secured by changing&#13;
the form of technology inflow towards less packaged alternatives, by&#13;
1/ See the many policies described in Sagasti (1978).&#13;
2/ "Although there is recognition of the country's dependence on foreign&#13;
technology, an important objective of this legislation is to gain a&#13;
degree of control over this major import, botli in terms of cost and of&#13;
technological impact."  (UJ4IDO, 1978, p. 3).  This statement of the&#13;
Mexican Governmlent is representative of the intentions of many govern-&#13;
ments active in this area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
avoiding duplicated i,nports, by outlawing restrictive clauses of technology&#13;
imports, and by reducing the value attributed to the marketing aspects of&#13;
technology. To date, most concentration - at UNCTAD and in developing&#13;
countries - has been devoted to the question of the direct cost of tech-&#13;
nology transfer, although few countries have effective policies. The&#13;
balance of the discussion below on specific policies reflects this, despite&#13;
the fact that the question of accumulation of technological capacity is&#13;
probably of greater long run significance than the costs of any particular&#13;
transaction. However, many countrie- are not yet in a position to generate&#13;
their own technology to a significant extent - nor do they have the administra-&#13;
tive and technological capacity to pursue the kind of screening policies&#13;
required.  For these countries, the policies towards costs are the most&#13;
relevant. While it may be argued that the administrative costs of such&#13;
policies are high, the 'success' stories have shown that the cost savings&#13;
are also high and in most cases easily outweigh administrative costs.&#13;
However, more research is needed on the real effectiveness of regulatory&#13;
policies, in the long run, including an investigation of the extent to which&#13;
formal restrictions replace formal ones.&#13;
Some of the policies aimed at reducing the costs of technology&#13;
imports will also contribute to increasing technological capacity: for&#13;
example, less packaged alternatives tend to involve less costs, and also&#13;
more freedom of decision making. Outlawing of restrictive clauses normally&#13;
also outlaws restrictions on learning and research. Policies reducing the&#13;
significance of foreign trademarks will help protect local technology. But&#13;
effective policies towards promoting technology capacity extend well beyond&#13;
those related to cost reductions.   Selectivity towards foreign technology imports&#13;
designed to protect local developments requires an assessment of local potential&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
in each area, permitting technology imports where these are likely to induce&#13;
local innovations but preventing them where they are likely to inhibit them.&#13;
This clearly is a delicate task involving considerable judgment on the part&#13;
of policy makers. Many countries lack the administrative capacity and&#13;
technological awareness to pursue this type of policy across the board.&#13;
However, screening policies can be adopted on an industry-by-industry basis,&#13;
starting with the industries where there is most local potential. Policies&#13;
to promote local technological developments must also contain a strong&#13;
positive promotional element, pursued simultaneously with screening poli-&#13;
cies towards foreign technology. Thus, as indicated by the varying ex-&#13;
perience in this area, policies towards technology imports and promotion&#13;
are not all-or-nothing, but rather can be pursued at a different level,&#13;
according to the objectives of the country and its administrative and tech-&#13;
nological capacity.&#13;
Economic Strategy and Technology Policy&#13;
The general economic strategy -f a country strongly influences&#13;
technological developments.-  This is most obvious - and most significant -&#13;
in relation to the question of appropriate technology, where policies&#13;
towards income distribution, trading strategy, factor prices and credit&#13;
availability are critical in determining the choice of products and tech-&#13;
niques. These relationships will be discussed more below. But the general&#13;
economic strategy is also of significance in relation to the other dimensions.&#13;
1/ "Explicit science and technology instruments are those intended to&#13;
affect directly the decisions having to do with the growth of local S&#13;
and T capabilities; implicit ones are those that affect decision making&#13;
indirectly through second-order effects. The great weight, both in&#13;
number and influence, of the latter limits the potential impact of the&#13;
former." (Sagasti).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49&#13;
Thus, the potential for charging excessive prices for techrology is much&#13;
greater in a non-competitive en'rironment.  Hence the worst examnples of&#13;
under-invoicing tend to occur in industries which are heavily protected,&#13;
and in which, as a result there is considerable potential for making ex-&#13;
cessive profits. Lack of competition is partly a national problem, partly&#13;
an international one. Industries which are technologically sophisticated&#13;
often lack effective competition on a world basis, and in such cases&#13;
national policies alone cannot be effective Ji eliminating the source of&#13;
non-competitiveness and, therefore, the excessive prices. An important&#13;
source of non-competitiveness occurs via trademarks, advertising and product&#13;
differentiation. In economies, in which this type of market structure is&#13;
predominant, excessive costs of technology imports are likely. Technology&#13;
policies may be designed to offset these effects (e.g. by regulating the&#13;
prices paid, investigating invoicing and so on), but so long as the funda-&#13;
mental causes remain, the policies may well prove to be only nominally&#13;
effective.&#13;
The general economic and technological environment is also of&#13;
significance in determining the rate of accumulation of technological&#13;
capacity. But simple generalizations about the relationship between trade&#13;
and pricing policies and indigenous technlcal change are not possible at&#13;
this stage. It is necessary first to distinguish between protection/&#13;
competition in the market for goods and that in the market for technology.&#13;
As already suggested, some protection in the market for technology may be&#13;
necessary to protect local technology, and this will extend to those goods&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
(notably capital goods) in which technology is embodied.  But this is the&#13;
reverse of the form which protection normally takes, where capital goods&#13;
and technology are subject to very little or no protection, while consumer&#13;
goods are subject to hcavy protection.-L It has been claimed that "in general,&#13;
import substitution policy and full-scale protection of consumer goods&#13;
industry have tended to promote a passive attitude to the utilization and&#13;
development of indigenous R and D efforts during the early phase of indus-&#13;
trial development ."-This claim seems to be borne out by case studies of&#13;
Brazil and Ghana.-/ Yet micro-studies of technical change suggest that&#13;
trading policies may not be of major significance. Examples of quite&#13;
substantial indigenous technical change have been found in both open and&#13;
closed economies.-/The success of countries such as Argentina and India -&#13;
both heavily protected economies - in developing technology exports-/&#13;
challenge the view that an open trading strategy and undistorted factor&#13;
prices are necessary for the generation of technical change.&#13;
Technological developments are uiost likely where there already&#13;
exists a certain amount of technological capacity, in the form of engineer-&#13;
ing resources and an innovative attitude on the part of entrepreneurs,&#13;

managers and worl&lt;ers. Given this sort of background, local innovation is&#13;
more likely the greater the pressures from the local environment which&#13;
make local technological change necessary or worthwhile. Such pressures&#13;
include 'natural' pressures occuring as a result of differences in physical&#13;
environment, market size, resource availability and cost as compared with&#13;
the environment for which the foreign technology was designed and 'artificial'&#13;
pressures created, for example, by restrictions on technology imports.&#13;
The general proposition that local technology change responds&#13;
to such pressures in the environment is well documented in the empirical&#13;
literature.-/ This would suggest that a competitive environment (both&#13;
nationally and internationally) and factor prices broadly in line with&#13;
factor availability would be more conducive to technical change than an&#13;
environment in which firms are highly protected and are able to survive&#13;
and prosper without innovation or adaptation.-/However, internal competition,&#13;
difference in market size and the non-availability of certain parts and&#13;
materials may be at least as effective a; international competition in&#13;
creating the required pressures. This explains why technical innovation&#13;
and adaption does seem to occur in 'protected' economies as well as in&#13;
open economies. More systematic comparative data is necessary, at both&#13;
macro- and micro-levels,before further and more confident generalizations&#13;
is possible.&#13;
1/ Many studies have suggested that adaption and innovation tend to occur&#13;
in response to necessity (e.g. the absence of particular materials, the&#13;
disappearance of markets, major differences in size of market) to a&#13;
greater extent than in response to less dramatic incentives offered by&#13;
cost differences.&#13;

Policies Towards the Terms of Transfer:&#13;
Policies towards foreign investment: direct overseas investment&#13;
provides the greatest potential for hidden costs of technology transfer, and&#13;
generally also involves the higlhest overt costs and the greatest loss of&#13;
independence in decision making. Policies which permit only a minority of&#13;
equity ownership on ntw investments, and a divestment on old are designed to&#13;
reduce these effects.&#13;
Many countries regard foreign direct investment as the only means of&#13;
securing the technology; but some have introduced restrictions on onwership&#13;
in order to meet their technology objectives. In some,majority foreign owner-&#13;
ship is only permitted in limited 'sophisticated' industries; in others it is&#13;
prohibited altogether.  In general, the aim seems to have been to regulate&#13;
permitted equity ownership without adversely affecting the inflow of foreign&#13;
technology.&#13;

The Andean Pact, decision 24, provided for divestnent as well as minority&#13;
foreign ownership in new investments.  According to the study by Mytelka the&#13;
divestment requirements had only had very limited effects by 1975.  The&#13;
inflow of U.S. direct investment does not appear to have been markedly affected&#13;
by the decision, as shown in the chart.&#13;
Transfer pricing and foreign investment: the terms of technology&#13;
transfer may be improved by enforcing arms length pricing on the inter-&#13;
national transactions of transnational companies for the purpose of customs&#13;
and taxation. In practice, this is difficult to achieve because arms length&#13;
prices are unknown and because of the administrative burden involved.&#13;
Kopits argues that "with the exception of the United States, most countries&#13;
have neither the willingness nor the administrative machinery to enforce&#13;
arms length prices....'"-/&#13;
Taxation policy: the tax system may be used to deal with the transfer&#13;
pricing problem more directly, by introducing taxes which will be th.e same&#13;
irrespective of the prices of imported inputs or exported output. T.io&#13;
approaches are possible: one is to impute the profits a company is making&#13;
in a particular country by assuming them to be the same ratio to some known&#13;
variable (e.g., turnover or. employment) as world wide profits are to world&#13;
wide turnover or employment. To be effective, this obviously requires that&#13;
world wide accounts are reliably known, which is not always the case. A&#13;
second approach is to introduce a uniform tax on all items, so that irrespec-&#13;

tive of price manipulation, the same tax will be paid. A uniform tax rate&#13;
levied on profits plus imported Lnputs plus royalty payments plus management&#13;
fees less exports would achieve this.-    It would remove the tax incentive&#13;
(but not other incentives) for transfer price manipulation, wniie eiiiuillatitig&#13;
the tax cost of such manipulation, and consequently improving the tetms of&#13;
technology transfer in the case of direct foreign investment. Some countries&#13;
have prohibited subsidiary cQmpanies from deducting royalities in payment&#13;
to parent companies in calculating tax liability, which is a first step&#13;
in this direction.2/&#13;
Raising tax rates and/or removinR tax incentives (hnlidays, in:Jvest-&#13;
ment grants etc.) would also improve the terms of technology transfer. In&#13;
some cases the terms a country pays would be improved without any deteri-&#13;
oration in the terms received by the company. This is the case where the&#13;
LDC effective tax rate is below that of the DC from which the investment&#13;
comes, and the DC uses the credit method of double tax relief, and dcoes not&#13;
permit tax sparing agreements.-/ In such cases any tax loss as a result of&#13;
low tax rates/tax incentives offered by LDCs simply increases DC tax revenue.4/&#13;
Since many LDCs offer extremely generous tax incentives,-/ and since the&#13;
J/ See I.L.O. (1972) for discussion of a similar proposal. The proposed&#13;
tax base is similar to the Eur-opean value added tax, except that it&#13;
excludes payments for local labor and materials.&#13;
2/ An obvious objection to the uniformity proposal is that it wnL0I  rermn    P, enitntry'&#13;
freedom to vary its rate of tariff on different items, since the tariff&#13;
on imports would be incorporatied into the uniform tax.&#13;

U.S. uses the credit method of tax relief and does not allow tax sparing&#13;
relief, this is the situation for a large proportion of investment in LDCs.&#13;
In such a situation, the LDCs should bring their tax rates into line with&#13;
those ruling in the DC country from which the bulk of their investment&#13;
comes. If they wish to give special incentives,'they should do so in the&#13;
form of subsidies (e.g., to employment) which would have the added advantage&#13;
of encouraging the sort of investment they wish for.&#13;
There have been numerous studies testifying to the extreme ineffective-&#13;
ness of tax incentives in LDCs in encouraging investment.-/ "The most&#13;
striking conclusion of the survey was that the foreign investors, almost&#13;
without exception, stated that taxation concessions played no role at all&#13;
in bringing them to Singapore". 2/ Studies in Argentina, Mexico, Jamaica,&#13;
Guatemala and Nigeria come to similar conclusions. Not a single study&#13;
suggests that tax incentives have been effective. They persist, nonethe-&#13;
less, increasing the cost of technology transfer to the countries concerned.&#13;
One reason is that each country believes it is on a kinked demand curve,&#13;
such that if it raised its tax rate and removed incentives it would lose&#13;
a large share of investment to neighboring countries. To get round this&#13;
belief (which -.ay well be a'misconception) regional agreement is required&#13;
in removing tax incentives and raising tax rates. Alternatively, countries&#13;
could act individually but maintain incentives by giving subsidies instead&#13;
of tax allowances.&#13;

Taxation may also be used (as discussed more below) to encourage&#13;
research and development and labor intensive techniques of production.&#13;
International Codesof Conduct: recent international initiatives&#13;
have been to negotiate International Codes of Conduct both with respect to&#13;
multinational corporations and to the transfer of technology.-! These&#13;
codes are intended to set standards for behavior in the case of MNCs in&#13;
relation to disclosure, taxation, employment behavior etc.; in the case of&#13;
the Code of Conduct for Technology Transfer in relation to payments for&#13;
technology, restrictive practices and so on. A major issue is whether the&#13;
Codes should be mandatory or voluntary; if voluntary their impact is li'kely&#13;
to be minimal, although they may perform an educational role and encourage&#13;
national action where major departures from the Code are noted. Some have&#13;
argued that mandatory Codes might impede progress in LDCs "since a general&#13;
and widely accepted Code would have such a low common denominator that it&#13;
would actually retard certain changes iL the third world".-/  It has been&#13;
suggested that these Codes should form part of a wider international&#13;
investment regime; the aim of such a regime would be to provide an inter-&#13;
national framework in which foreign investment would be regulated. The&#13;
regime, it is argued, would reduce uncertainty (and might include features&#13;
such as guarantees, insurance etc. that would ensure this), would provide&#13;

discussed shortly. The U.N. center for Transnational Corporations is in&#13;

for the fairer distributioa cf benefits and costs, and would thus encourage&#13;
the regulated flow of technology and finance, benefitting all three parties&#13;
TNCS, developed countries and developing countries.&#13;
Policies towards technology contracts: the policies just discussed&#13;
are concerned with technology transfer in tae form of direct investment.&#13;
But as ownership restrictions become effective, technology transfer&#13;
increasingly becomes an arms length transaction between national (or joint)&#13;
companies and foreign suppliers. It then becomes important to regulate&#13;
this so as to prevent this form of technology transfer having the undesirable&#13;
effects described. To this end, a number of countries have begun to intervene&#13;
actively in the inflow of technology by establishing national registries of&#13;
technology, reviewing and renegotiating technology contracts, and outlawing&#13;
various restrictive practices. These policies may be designed to have the&#13;
joint effects of increasing the bargaining power of national companies,&#13;
reducing costs of technology transfer, protecting local technological&#13;
developmeits, increasing the learning effects of imported technology and&#13;
reducing the loss of independence in decision making. As suggested above,&#13;
some of the objectiF.es are mutually reinforcing.&#13;
There are National Registries of Technology in the Andean Pact&#13;
countries (established in 1971), Argentina (1971) Mexico (1973), S.Korea&#13;
(1976) and India (1977). In other countries, other parts of the government&#13;
machinery may effectively act as a national registry (e.g., Portugal).&#13;
National registries require the registration of all technology contracts&#13;
with foreign suppliers;this registration may only be permitted after&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
government approval, which may only be given if the contract fulfills&#13;
certain conditions and is on reasonable terms. The Andean Pact Decision&#13;
provided for the exchange of infornation between registries thus strengthening&#13;
the potential of each national registry.&#13;
It is worth investigating one country's experience in some detail&#13;
in order to illustrate how registration may contribute to objectives. In&#13;
Mexico the legislation prohibits technology agreements as follows:&#13;
1. when the purpose is to transfer technology already freely&#13;
available in the country (objectives: cost and protection of&#13;
of local technology);&#13;
2. when the price is unjustified (cost);&#13;
3.  when provisions are included which permit the supplier to&#13;
regulate or intervene in the administration of the transferee&#13;
(independence);&#13;
4. when there is an obligation to assign to the supplier of the&#13;
technology the patents, trade marks, innovations or improvements&#13;
received by the transferee (learning and independence);&#13;
5. when limitations are imposed on technological research or develop-&#13;
ment (learning and independence);&#13;
6.  when there is an obligation to acquire inputs from any given&#13;
source (costs and independence);&#13;
7. when exports are prohibited against the best interests of the&#13;
country (costs and independence);&#13;
8.  when the use of complementary technologies is prohibited&#13;
(costs, independence and learning);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
9.  when chere is an obligation to sell exclusively to the supplier&#13;
of the technology (costs and independence);&#13;
10.  when the transferee is required to use  permanently,personnel&#13;
designated by the supplier (independence, learning and costs);&#13;
11.  when the volume of production is limited, or sale or resale&#13;
prices imposed (independence and costs);&#13;
12.  when the transferee is required to appoint the supplier as exclusive&#13;
sales agent in Mexico (independence and costs);&#13;
13.  when unreasonable terms of duration are established (costs&#13;
and learning);&#13;
14.  when the parties shall submit to foreign courts for decisions&#13;
in interpreting contracts (national independence).&#13;
Since the law came into effect in 1973, the Registry has examined about 4,600&#13;
agreements. 35% were rejected for excessive payments or restrictive clauses;&#13;
60% were rejected if one excludes majority foreign owned enterprises. The&#13;
table indi ates the most frequent reasons for negative resolutions.&#13;

Agreements&#13;

2.  Excessive duration of agreements                   31.6&#13;

or to manufacture goods, at the end of the&#13;

interest of the country                            14.5&#13;

It is claimed that the policy has substantially reduced foreign&#13;
exchange costs of technology, operned export markets, increased tax revenue,&#13;
reduced prices of capital goods arLd produced "growing consciousness among&#13;
Mexican entrepreneurs, who have understood better the importance for&#13;
productivity and profits, of obtaining full information on technological&#13;
alternatives, conducting a careful evaluation and selection of products,&#13;
processes, and licensors, and negotiati.ng terms of contracts from the&#13;
strongest possible position."'l&#13;
The Mexican experience appears to confirm the pioneering efforts&#13;
in Coiombia where a Comite de Regalias was established in 1967. Between&#13;
1967 and 1971 the Comite de Regalias of Colombia evaluated 395 contracts&#13;
of which 334 were negotiated, modified and eventually approved and 61 were&#13;
rejected. In the process of negotiation,payments of royalties were&#13;
reduced by about 40%. Between th- latter part of 1970 and the beginning&#13;
of 1971 the Comite reduced by 90% tie-in clauses, eliminated export restrictive&#13;
clauses, eltminated by 80% minimum royalty payments, prohibited tax deduc-&#13;
tion for royalties and established maximum percentage royalty rates.2/&#13;
For most part these policies have been directed at reducing the&#13;
cost of technology transfer. Experience of these and other countries suggests&#13;
considerable foreign exchange gains can be made by national policies to&#13;
regulate the terms of technology transfer. It should be noted, however,&#13;
that the gains be in large part only nominal. Registries and other regula-&#13;
tions determine the formal contracts, but informal arrangements may&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
negate their effects.-/ Effo-rts to regulate the transfer could be strengthened&#13;
in their content (e.g. some courtrias prohibit the duplicated transfer of&#13;
the same or very similar technology) and through an international dimension.&#13;
With international exchange of information on technology bargains, each&#13;
nation's capacity to regulate the terms of the inflow would be strengthened,&#13;
as would its knowledge about alternative sources of technology. Such inter-&#13;
national cooperation could best be started on a regional basis. The Andean&#13;
Pact contains provisions for such cooperation. International cooperation&#13;
would be particularly useful for countries with a weak administrative&#13;
structure, which can do little on their own.&#13;
The effectiveness of such regulatory measures depend largely on two&#13;
factors: first, on how fast technology suppliers replace their formal restric-&#13;
tive activities by identical informal activities; secondly, on how toughly the&#13;
local administrators pursue the policies. In the context of an economy which&#13;
relies heavily on the import of te hnology, local administrators very often&#13;
become embroiled in the interests of the technology suppliers and are then un-&#13;
able to trEat them with the arms length objectivity that is required.  The piece-&#13;
meal dismantling (or weakening) of some of the efforts to regulate the inflow of&#13;
technology (of which we see signs with respect to the Andean Pact and Mexico, for&#13;
example) suggest that early successes may exaggerate the full impact of regula-&#13;
tion. We need more information on these areas.&#13;
Promotion of Technological Accumulation&#13;
The main purpose of most of the policies just described - and the&#13;
way in which they tend to be interpreted by those countries which carry&#13;
l/ According to Sagasti, Registries only control the formal contract: "A&#13;
potential licensee who needs technology is in fact at the mercy of the&#13;
licensor who has the technology.  No amount of government intervention&#13;
can restrict the prOssurcs imposed by a licenser, and most licensees&#13;
submit voluntarily to the demandls, although the formal contract may not&#13;
reflect any controls." (p. 19).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
them out - is to control and improve the terms on which foreign. technology&#13;
is transferred, rather than to prornote local technological developments.&#13;
Some of the policies would also contribute to this objective as shown, for&#13;
example, by the details of the M"exiLcan provisions. But more comprehensive&#13;
policies are necessary if the promotion of technological developments&#13;
locally is the main objective: indeed for countries which have the capa-&#13;
city and intention to pursue this als a major objective the cost issue - on&#13;
which so much attention is currently focussed - becomes of subsidiary importa2.ze.&#13;
There may be, as already indicated, many routes to the achieve-&#13;
ment of a sustained process of indigenous technical innovation. Contrast,&#13;
for example, the different paths pursued historically by the UK, the US,&#13;
Germany and Japan.-/ Moreover, there is considerable uncertainty as to&#13;
either necessary or sufficient conditions in developing countries today.&#13;
But the following seem to be the types of policies likely to be conducive&#13;
to technological change:&#13;
a. Policies which protect local technological develop-&#13;
ments by permitting only selective import of foreign&#13;
technology;&#13;
b.  Policies which remove legal restrictions on local&#13;
developments, and reduce the excessive market value&#13;
attributed to foreign as against local technology:&#13;
i.e. policies towards patents and trademarks. trade-&#13;
mark policies may also contribute to the cost reduc-&#13;
tion objective.&#13;
c. Policies which promote local technological develop-&#13;
ments by providing the required infrastructure,&#13;
education, institutions, incentives and so on.&#13;

(a) Selectivity towards technology impor.ts. Most successful&#13;
'second comers' technologically have relied on the selective import of&#13;
technology from abroad. According to Rosenberg the U.S. was "highly&#13;
discriminating in borrowing patterns and highly selective in the uses&#13;
to which imported technologies  were put."" In 19th Century U.S. this&#13;
was achieved without deliberate government intervention, as a result of&#13;
relatively high levels of local mechanical and innovative abilities,&#13;
reacting with the very substantial differences in resource availability&#13;
compared with technology supplving countries, notably the U.K. Japan's&#13;
policy of selectivity was a much more conscious and deliberate part of&#13;
government policy. Between 1868 and the 1950s, Japan regulated and&#13;
restricted technology imports ruthlessly, while promoting local technological&#13;
capacity by education and learning by doing. The aim was to import&#13;
technology from abroad only once, and then learn to develop and adapt the&#13;
technology herself. The import of technology was "effected by diverse&#13;
means ranging from sending missions overseas to seek and purchase machinery&#13;
to more sophisticated technical licensing agreements with foreign&#13;
technology suppliers" ..."the importation of machinery ... immediately&#13;
became the object of imitation and trial manufacture, and eventually&#13;
of domestic production."2/&#13;
The net effect was a steady rise-in the level of technology&#13;
imports and a change in their composition to ever more sophisticated&#13;
industries.&#13;

In some ways, developing countries today face a more difficult&#13;
situation and have mbre need for protection of local developments than&#13;
the early latecomers. The scientific and technological gap between&#13;
their own capacities and that of the advanced countries is greater, and&#13;
the commercialization of technology and the domination of the technology&#13;
market by a small number of transnational corporations has gone much&#13;
further. Successful protection and promotion requires a dual policy of&#13;
selectivity towards imports and promotion of local developments.&#13;
Selectivity involves some form of control over technology&#13;
imports which may be achieved in a variety of ways: the centralized&#13;
purchase of all technology imports provides one-model (involving obvious&#13;
administrative problems - it is probably a better model for socialist&#13;
than mixed economies); an alternative is for some form of compulsory&#13;
registration (as with the National Registers described above), where&#13;
permission for technology imports is given only if the technology import&#13;
can be shown to be complementary io (rather than competitive with) local&#13;
technological efforts. An efficiency criterion may be added to prevent&#13;
excessive protection leading to very inefficient technology.&#13;
Mytelka's research into the Andean Pact country experience&#13;
suggests that the development of local capacity to choose and generate&#13;
technology may require unpackaged non-contractual technology transfer.&#13;
-This is difficult to induce; however, promotion of local consultancy&#13;
firms, specializing in packaging, would reduce dependency on foreign&#13;
sources    for packaging.&#13;

For the most part, azcording to Sagasti, screening of foreign&#13;
technology has been weak because the agencies involved lack firm and&#13;
clear criteria for selection.-/ South Korea has recently introduced&#13;
selectivity permitcing the input: of technology only if it fulfills&#13;
various criteria; technologies which duplicate existing technologies,&#13;
or which would easily be developed locally are not to be imported.&#13;
However, it seems in practice that a very liberal interpretation is&#13;
adopted and most requests for technology imports are granted.  While&#13;
the import of technology is in theory, subject to regulation, the S.&#13;
Korean Technology Transfer Centre conducts an active survey to identify&#13;
foreign technologies that are needed, and has specified 1958 technolo-&#13;
gies needed over the next five years necessary for the production of&#13;
1,500 items in the machinery, electronics, metal and chemical&#13;
industries.-/&#13;
(b) Two types of legal restriction provide an especial&#13;
handicap to local technological developments - patents and trademarks:&#13;
Patents: thLe international patent system was intended to protect&#13;
and encourage innovations.  But the system does not appear to work in the&#13;
best interests of developing countries. Of the world total, 6% of patents&#13;
were granted by developing countries, and of these 5/6 are held by&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
foreigners, mostly TNCs, and only one sixth by developing country nationals.&#13;
The commercial value of those held by nationals is relatively small.&#13;
Among patents issued to foreigners by LDCs, the vast majority (over 90%)&#13;
are not exploited. Patents thus, for the most part, tend to prevent&#13;
competition and local innovation, rather than encourage itT Currently moves&#13;
are under way to secure reform of the international patent system: the&#13;
proposed reforms include   the introduction of investors certificates,&#13;
exclusion of some products/processed from patentability, limitations on&#13;
patent duration, stricter provisions for compulsory licensing and revocation&#13;
as remedy for non-use, removal of restrictions on imports of articles and&#13;
products           manufactured by a process which is patented in the&#13;
country, and strengthening disclosure requirements.&#13;
International reform along these lines is preferable to individual&#13;
national initiatives, but if it fails, or proves insufficient each country&#13;
(or group of countries)    has the power to enforce their own system, as&#13;
have a number of countries including Japan, Italy and the Eastern block&#13;
countries.&#13;
1/  See Vaitsos (1972), and UNCTAD (1975b):  "patent practices of&#13;
developing countries, following international standards,&#13;
have legalized this peculiar situation wlhich has come to act as a&#13;
system of reverse preferences granted to foreign patent holders in&#13;
the markets of developing countries".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Trademavrks:    tradcrmarks act as a c3r.ificate of origin and&#13;
a guarantee of quality. Eut the costs to LECs are high. While the private&#13;
benefits of acquirLng a trademark to a particular entrepreneur, in terms&#13;
of market power, may be great, there are social costs.  The system encourages&#13;
the import of foreign technology from companies responsible for well known&#13;
trademarks, even where there are alternative sources of technology,&#13;
domestically or from less well known and less costly sources overseas and thus&#13;
reinforces foreign technological domination. It tends to favor the&#13;
established and well known, making it more difficult for newcomers to&#13;
compete. It leads to expenditure on advertising, some of which is infor-&#13;
mative, much persuasive, which developing countries can ill-afford.&#13;
According to one estimate a group of developing countries spen., on average,&#13;
0.77% of GNP on advertising,-L/ (which is more than expenditure on Rand D.).&#13;
Moreover, products originating in developed countries tend to be most&#13;
heavily advertised which means that inappropriate products tend to be&#13;
overpromoted in relation to traditional and appropriate products.- In&#13;
general, the question of trademarks is most critical for consumer goods,&#13;
and of lesser significance for capital and intermediate goods.&#13;
In developing countries 50% of new trademarks issues in 1974 were&#13;
registered by foreigners (88% in Africa, 65% in Asia and 34% in Latin America),&#13;
a sizeable increase over 1964 (when 27% of newq trademarks were registered&#13;
by foreigners). The vast majority of trademarks registered by foreigners&#13;
are from developed-market economies (95%); 1% are owned by nationals of other&#13;
developing countries. Chemicals, food, tobacco and textiles account for&#13;
60% of the new registrations.-J&#13;

2/ The situation is notoriously bad in the drug industry where brand name/&#13;
advertised drugs are widely prescribed, although the costs are sometimes&#13;
50 tilnes or more those of generic equivalents.  See Lall (1975).&#13;

Trademarks are said to be a powerful tool for the promotion of&#13;
exports. However, developing countries have not, for the most part, used&#13;
this tool to promote their own trademarks:  insofar as trademarks  have&#13;
been used, they have been mainly of foreign origin.&#13;
Policies Towards Trademarks:   some of the abuses associated with&#13;
trademarks would be eliminated by policies which eliminated restrictive&#13;
practices in technology contracts. But other action would be required&#13;
to reduce this source of monopolistic power, to protect the development&#13;
of local technologies, and to reduce other undesired effects of the&#13;
trademark  system.  The following represents a broad range of possibilities.&#13;
i. Total abolition of trademarks in all sectors, or in selected&#13;
sectors. The major problem here is the need to provide alter-&#13;
native systems of protection for consumers: these are difficult&#13;
to devise and costly to administer. One possibilit-y would be&#13;
to provide govennment 'utility' certificates to products ful-&#13;
filling required standards.&#13;
For political and administrative reasons, this does not seem to&#13;
be a likely policy for most countries in relation to all sectors. However,&#13;
selected sectors a're especially   suitable for such policies.  In particular,&#13;
it is a possibility for the drug industry and has been recommended by the&#13;
Hathi Coimnittee in India, xwhich proposed that India's basic drug needs&#13;
could be met by 116 generic drugs, as against 15,000 drugs currently&#13;
marketed.11 Since there is sectoral concentration of trade mark registra-&#13;
tion, action of this sort in one or two sectors might do much to prevent&#13;
1/  Policies to replace brarndecl drugs with generic drugs were introduced&#13;
in Sri Lanka in 1972.  The State Pharmaceutical Corporation purchased 47&#13;
drugs at an average cost of 28% of the price quoted by the former trans-&#13;
national suppliers. But after a major campaign, the policies were partially&#13;
reversed in 1977.  In Afghanistan a recent statute imposed the use of generic&#13;
names for pharmaceuticals.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6)&#13;
abuses.&#13;
For most sectors, however, we may assume that the system is&#13;
likely to remain, and therefore policies need to be devised to reduce&#13;
abuses:&#13;
ii. Limitations on permitted advertising.&#13;
iii. Consumer education.&#13;
iv. Alternative sources of quality control, such as government&#13;
approval certificates, and legislative standards.&#13;
v.  Compulsory licensing of trademarks such that all who wish may&#13;
produce with the trade-iark on payment of some specified fee.&#13;
vi. Raising the fees for registration of trademarks, particularly&#13;
in relation to renewals.-/&#13;
These policies are applicable to all trademarks, foreign or national,&#13;
Other policies may be devised to give special protecticka to local&#13;
trade marks:&#13;
vii. By a differential system of charging fees.&#13;
viii.  By banning foreign trademarks, totally or selectively.&#13;
ix.  By the development of joint trademarks.  In both Mexico and Brazil&#13;
policies to encourage joint trademarks have been introduced.&#13;
In NIexico joint trademlarks are nmandatory, in Brazil optional,&#13;
the option to be exercised by the licensee. Joint trademarks&#13;
permit the sharing of the benefits from good will created&#13;
by the imarks, and assist in the development of the local&#13;
trademark.  But they are unlikely to have major effects on&#13;
consumption patterns or local technological developments.&#13;
1/  Fees chargcd for regist:ration In developing countries are on average&#13;
half those charged in developed countries. In developed countries&#13;
renewal fees are as high or higher than initial fees; in developing&#13;
countries iriany -countrics charge a lowqer fee and some charge no fee&#13;
at all.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
The question of trademarks is one of the most important issues in&#13;
relation to technology transfer in the area of consumers goods and medicines;&#13;
it is closely related to the question of costs, since consumer preference for well&#13;
known trademarks permits technology suppliers to earn quasi-rents; it is related&#13;
to the question of the developmenit of local technological capacity, as esta-&#13;
blished trademarks provide an obst:acle to the development and use of local tech-&#13;
nologies; and it is also relevant to the question of appropriate products and&#13;
techniques. Yet is is a relatively new area, in terms of policy. Few&#13;
policies have been tried and partly as a consequence many have not been&#13;
fully developed. Policies here are closely tied up with many other&#13;
areas of policy - towards consumption patterns, and international trade&#13;
as well as technology.  In this area (as in others) it is fairly easy to&#13;
see the direction in which countries should go if they are to share the&#13;
rents earned,but more difficult to see how to protect local dejelopments.&#13;
International action to develop agreed LDC product standards and systems&#13;
of quality control, independently of t-ademarks,is one possible way forward.&#13;
(c)  Policies to promote local technological innovation.-/   Policies&#13;
to promote local technological developments are clearly an essential counter-&#13;
part of policies towards technology imports. The range of policies adopted&#13;
to promote technological development are well known. On the supply side,&#13;
1/ The main focus of this paper is on the international transfer of&#13;
technology. Consequently, the sections devoted to local technological&#13;
developments are shorter than a balanced treatment would require. More&#13;
discussion is contained in the section on Appropriate Technology below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

they include building up scientific and techrical infrastructure, providing&#13;
general and technizal education and training, promoting local consultancy&#13;
firms and developing Technology Plans.  On the demand side, they include&#13;
government procurement policies, tax and incentive policies and industrial&#13;
policies. In addition to these 'explicit' science and technology policies&#13;
there are also - as discussed above - general economic policies which&#13;
influence the rate of local innovation.  Unfortunately, while the relevant&#13;
promotional policies are well known, there is considerable controversy&#13;
surrounding almost every one of t Cem. Sagasti's survey of science and&#13;
technology policy instruments concludes that "evidence gathered in the&#13;
Science and Technology Policy Instruments project shows overwhelmingly that&#13;
the explicit S and T instruments (with the exception-of personnel training)&#13;
have little impact on technological change particulazly at the early stages&#13;
of industrialization." The major impetus in most LDCs has been towards&#13;
building up institutions for basic restarch, seeing these are the first step&#13;
in the innovative chain: but whether this is an essential part of technical&#13;
innovation, or a sensible way of developing countries to spend scarce resources&#13;
is now subject to donsiderable controversy: "the less developed world is strewn&#13;
with scientific institutes and other expensive white elephants which contribute&#13;
neither to science nor to technology.' '1 Technology Plans are becoming&#13;
increasingly fashionable, but like general economic plans, their effectiveness&#13;
depends on the policies and projects they produce rather than the Plan document&#13;
itself, which may often prove a waste of scarce administrative resources.&#13;
1/  Ranis in Beranek and Ranis (1978).  Ilis paper sammarizes the arguments for&#13;
and against basic scienice in LDCs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
Many tax incentives have proved redundant:-/ the most successful are the&#13;
most specific, as in Peru and S. Korea. But as with most tax incentives,&#13;
there is a strong possibility that they will simply induce firms to categorize&#13;
expenditure as 'R. and D.' in order to qualify for the incentives, without&#13;
making any real changes. Moreover, such incentives tend to leave out the&#13;
more mundane minor innovative activities, which may have at least as much&#13;
to contribute to the innovative process, and may be an essential precursor&#13;
of major innovation.&#13;
Government procurement policies represent one of the most powerful&#13;
tools available for promoting the use of local technology.&#13;
Four conclusions appear to stand out from experience with respect to&#13;
promoting local technological change: first, that links with industry are&#13;
.essential, if promotional efforts are not simply to add to the zoo of&#13;
white elephants. Such links may be achieved through contract research,&#13;
in-house research or strong informal links between the scientific and&#13;
technological activity.-/ Secondly, that there has been some tendency to&#13;
overdo basic science as against applied science and technology. Thirdly,&#13;
that there is a criitical mass of scientific and technological activity&#13;
necessary before the work has any substantial effects. Some of the apparent&#13;
failures of many LDCs may be because this critical mass has not yet been&#13;
reached. It has been suggested that certain countries - notably Argentina,&#13;
India, Brazil, S. Korea and Mexico - have now achieved the minimal critical&#13;

mass for indigenous technological developmer.t -  zourthlly, countries&#13;
should specialize in scLence and technology, consciously choosing the&#13;
areas which they intend to develop, and concentrate promotional activities&#13;
and selectivity towards foreign technology imports, in these areas.2/&#13;
Administration&#13;
The discussion of policies has briefly reviewed a large number of&#13;
actions LDC governments might take, if they adopt an active technology&#13;
policy. Some of them would impose heavy a6ministrative costs&#13;
since they involve investigating techrology contracts one by one: policies&#13;
towards costs and those involving screening foreign technology imports&#13;
would be especially costly from an administrative point of view; they would&#13;
also (particularly the screening policy) require considerable technical&#13;
expertise, which is especially scarce in most LDCs.   Thus the administrative&#13;
costs involved are by no means trivial; it is therefore necessary to&#13;
establish that such resources are available, and that their use in this&#13;
respect would be worthwhile. Here one needs to distinguish between policies&#13;
directed towards improving the terms of the transfer and those towards screen-&#13;
ing imports to promote local developments.&#13;
Many countries are not yet at a stage in which very much screening&#13;
makes sense. For this there must be a certain amount of local technological&#13;
capacity. The development of such capacity requires the sort of promotional&#13;
1/ Sagasti (1978)&#13;
2/  Cooper (1976), Sagasti (1978) and Ranis in Beranek and Ranis (1978)&#13;
all come to this conclusion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
policies just discussed, and is likely to take place initially on the basis&#13;
of imported technology. Hence, countries which are particularly weak&#13;
administratively (especially in relation to the special skills required&#13;
of technology administrators) are also those where screening policies are&#13;
premature. They may be desirable in one or two industries but screening&#13;
for these cases would not require excessive administrative resources. But&#13;
these countries, which rely heavily on imported technology and lack much&#13;
capacity themselves, are precisely those where policies towards controlling&#13;
the terms of transfer are likely to generate the greatest gains. Moreover,&#13;
the established magnitude of the Iains are such that even quite heavy&#13;
administrative resources (which may themselves be bought from abroad,&#13;
for example from more advanced LDCs) would be justified. But where the&#13;
administrative base is weak there is much to be said- for introducing&#13;
general policies - such as taxation and policies towards protection and&#13;
trademarks - which reduce the foreign exchange loss through technology&#13;
purchase and therefore the need for aduinistrative policies to control it.&#13;
As already suggested, regional and international cooperation may ease&#13;
the administrative burden.&#13;
Countries which are more developed, in technological terms, are those&#13;
for which the screening policies are more relevant, but they also have more&#13;
techno-administrative resources to support them. Moreover, as they gain in&#13;
technological strength, the importance of policies towards the terms of&#13;
transfer diminishes because the individual enterprises become increasingly&#13;
capable of striking a satisfactory bargain for themselves and hence the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
terms tend to improve without sc riuclh goverTLmert inte-vention1  An&#13;
effective screening policy does require considerable expettise and&#13;
judgement, but given that the policy m.ay be initially concentrated on&#13;
a few industries, the costs need not be excessive.&#13;
Aspects of Political Economy&#13;
Many of the policies described involve challenging very powerful&#13;
interests: some of these interests are outside the developing countries,&#13;
but in many cases they have been internalizad and are well represented&#13;
within the country concerned. The history of attempts to control the&#13;
terms of technology transfer is strewn with failures of 'will,' which is&#13;
a somewhat amorphous way of describing successful resistance, on the part&#13;
of the interests involved, to attempts to control them. The following few&#13;
examples provide indicationis of what can happen.&#13;
In both Sri Lanka and Brazil, plans to replace brandname drugs&#13;
with generic drugs were diluted after powerful political campaigns which&#13;
had strong foreign support.2/&#13;
In Mexico, the near monopoly position of a successful national firm&#13;
in the steroid hormone industry, which led in research and development,&#13;
was broken as a result of strong protestations by U.S. Companies, and&#13;
1/  Sagasti concludes that countries which are more technol6gically&#13;
sophisticated "suffer less from the restrictions that normally&#13;
accompanly the irmports of technology and pay less for knowledge&#13;
than do firms in countries where these capabilities have not been&#13;
developed " (p. 49). But the experience of the U.K. both in relation&#13;
to oil and natural gas technology, and to pharmaceuticals (La Roclhe)&#13;
show that eternal vigilance is required.&#13;

pressure from the U.S. Government. As a result shortly after the industry&#13;
was dominated by foreign subsidiaries, which secured the plant barbasco,&#13;
on terms which meajnt that much of the rent from this rare plant was taken&#13;
out of Mexico. Later, government attempts to regain control over the&#13;
industry for Mexican firms failed partly due to political opposition.L/&#13;
Mytelka (1977) illustrates aspects of political economy with respect&#13;
to three Andean Pact countries, following their common policy of Decision 24.&#13;
Peru, with a stronger national bourgeousie, succeeded in divesting in&#13;
accordance with this policy between 1970 and 1975, while changes in Ecuador&#13;
and Colombia, where foreign interests were relatively stronger, were&#13;
negligible.&#13;
Certain conclusions are suggested by taking the political economy&#13;
dimension into account: first, from a political point of view the ability&#13;
to control the terms of technology transfer is likely to be greater the more&#13;
arms lergth (and the less) previous relationships with technology suppliers.&#13;
Thus, paradoxically, from this point of view, less developed countries with&#13;
little technology transfer may be in a stronger position than those where&#13;
interests are firmly entrenched. Secondly, certain types of policy may be&#13;
easier to secure, from a political. point of view, than others. General&#13;
promotional policies are likely to be more acceptable than specific restrictive&#13;
policies. This is not just because they are likely to be less effective&#13;
(although doubtless this is part of the story) but also because their effects&#13;
are normally more widely spread and therefore specific opposition is less&#13;
likely to be aroused. Thirdly, discretionary policies are more subject to&#13;
1/ Cereffi (1978)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7/ -&#13;
abuse (and to thwartirg by e.g., brit-ery) than general policies.  This&#13;
suggests that general tax changes may be more effective than particular&#13;
contract-by-contract negotiaticns.  But, although they may be more ef'ective&#13;
if properly conceived and introduced, for this vcry reason, they are likely&#13;
to be subject to very great opposition.&#13;
The political economy aspects do not provide a reason for not&#13;
trying to introduce desirable changes: they suggest that political forces&#13;
should be taken into account in formul'ating policies and the need for strong&#13;
'will' to carry them out, needs to be emphasized.&#13;
&#13;

VI. The Characteristics of Technology&#13;
The characteristics of technology are largely determined by the&#13;
nature of the economies for which they are designed. The most significant&#13;
determinants of the characteristics of new technology are the income levels,&#13;
resource availability and costs in the society in and for which the technology&#13;
is designed, and the system of organization of production, and the nature of&#13;
the technology in use in the society. In each of these respects, societies&#13;
of advanced countries differ from those of poor countries. Consequently,&#13;
technology designed to suit advanced countries tends to be ill adapted (or&#13;
'inappropriate') to the conditions prevalent in poor countries. The transfer&#13;
of such technology to poor societies tends, as a result, to cause various&#13;
distortions and inefficiencies.&#13;
In discussing 'characteristics' of technology, one should include&#13;
all :-he relevant features which determine its resource use, productivity,&#13;
and impact on production and consumption patterns. These features include&#13;
the nature and design of the product, the scale and organizational system&#13;
for which the technology is designed, its resource use, including capital&#13;
and labor intensity, materials and fuel use, skill requirements, and the&#13;
infrastructural and complementary inputs it requires. The traditional&#13;
economists' characterization of techniques according to their capital or&#13;
labor intensity forms only one, and quite often a relatively ipsignificant,&#13;
aspect of the total characterization.&#13;
The income levels of a society broadly determine consumption&#13;
patterns, both as to the type of products consumed and as to the nature of&#13;
products within each broad category of need. Countries with the same&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79&#13;
average income  evel may differ in c,nsamption patterns beicause of diffe-&#13;
rences in income distribution and cultural anid institutional differences.&#13;
Nonetheless, average income levels are an important determinant of con-&#13;
sumption patterns. The design of products irn advanced countr-es, then, is&#13;
broadly in line with their income levels. Wlen products are transferred to&#13;
poorer societies, their characteristics tend to be out of line with average&#13;
income levels. This results in imbalances in consumption patterns: the&#13;
imbalance partly takes the form of maldistribution of income and consumption,&#13;
so that a small proportion of the p^'pulation earn incomes similar to those&#13;
of rich societies, and have correspondingly similar consumption patterns.&#13;
Another form of imbalance is that which occurs in expenditure patterns at low&#13;
income levels: a high proportion of expenditure may be devoted to goods&#13;
designed for higher income levels, while other needs are relatively neg-&#13;
lected.l/&#13;
The view that products are desi.gned for particular income levels,&#13;
and ma. be inappropriate for societies with much lower incomes, does not&#13;
mean such products confer no net benefits on these societies and should be&#13;
rejected. In some cases, this may be the situation. But in others, the&#13;
products may extend choice and increase welfare. Given the massive research&#13;
and eevelopment devoted to new products-/ in advanced socirties, the near&#13;
l/ A rLcent study by J. Wells (1977) quotes a survey in Sao Paulo, Brazil,&#13;
which found that between 1959 and 1969/70 'there was a significant rise&#13;
in the share of household expenditure devoted to domestic appliances...&#13;
an a.ialysis of (physical) per capita food consumption shows that there&#13;
was :, douvnward trend, indicating that levels of nutrition among the work-&#13;
Ing class deteriorated absolutely.,&#13;
2/ Al. Javestigations into motives and outcome of R. and D. in advanced&#13;
countrics show that much the largest proportion is devoted to new products&#13;
or imTr'vements in old products.  See Gustafson (1962) and Mansfield (1969).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
complete neglect-of research into products specifically appropriate to poor&#13;
societies, and the economies of scale associated with the mass production of&#13;
many of these new products, many modern products increase the efficiency of&#13;
need fulfillment, even for low income consumers, as compared with the pre-&#13;
vious range of choice. There are cases where the modern products may&#13;
decrease welfare. But the main argument about appropriate products is not&#13;
that new products from advanced countries decrease welfare absolutelv,-/ hut&#13;
that they tend to have high-income characteristics, and result in consump-&#13;
tion imbalances compared with new products specifically designed for the&#13;
conditions and income levels of poor societies.&#13;
In general, it is to be expected that new products would increase&#13;
welfare by increasing the range of choice open to consumers. But if the&#13;
new products completely displace (or raise the costs substantially) of old&#13;
products with more appropriate characteristics, or if consumer choice is&#13;
distorted by advertising exclusively devoted to one class of products, con-&#13;
sumers in poor societies may actually be nade worse off than before the new&#13;
products were introduced.-  This is particularly likely to be the situation&#13;
l/ Because of their high income characteristics, new products do tend to&#13;
benefit higher income groups disproportionately thus leading to a rela-&#13;
tive deterioration in income distribution, but not one that is normally&#13;
captured by the statistics.&#13;
2/ In my study of maize milling, I found that the most recently developed&#13;
product was more expensive, less nutritious and required a more capital&#13;
intensive and large scale technology. It was the only branded product&#13;
and the only one advertised._ Consumers were switching to it in a&#13;
substantial way.  This was not only due to advertising,  It lasted longer&#13;
and many consumers preferred the taste. Similar examples are to be&#13;
found in the drug industry where new products, which are much more expensive than&#13;
the old generic equivalent,are heavily advertised, and also have some additional&#13;
benefits (e.g. in terms of reduced side effects). See Speiglit (1975).&#13;

where there are major ineivisibilities, so that decisions are non-marginal.&#13;
Very often this applies to decisions involving government expenditure such&#13;
as major irrigation projects, hospitals, road and transport systems, military&#13;
systems and so on.&#13;
The higher level of incomes in advanced countries also influences&#13;
resource availability and costs. The labor force tends to be highly&#13;
educated; real incomes and the 6pportunity cost of employing labor is high.&#13;
Thus techniques designed for these conditions tend to involve high levels&#13;
of worker education and skills, and high levels of productivity. Moreover,&#13;
the high incomes generate a corresponding high level of savings per head,&#13;
and therefore of investible resources.  In comparison with average per capita&#13;
resource availability in LDCs, the technology, therefore, requires savings&#13;
per workplace far in excess of those available and makes education require-&#13;
ments greater than those the country can afford. If the technology is&#13;
transferred unmodified to poorer countries, investment resources and ex-&#13;
penditure on the development of human resources have to be disproportionately&#13;
devoted to a small proportion of the population.&#13;
The organization system of advanced countries - with large units&#13;
of production managed by a professional managerial class - influences the&#13;
type of technology that: the system produces. Inevitably, new techniques&#13;
that fit in with this structure tend to be developed, rather than techniques&#13;
designed for a radically different system. But the system is very far&#13;
removed from traditional societies in most LDCs; to adopt the technology&#13;
efficiently, the advanced country productive system has to be reproduced.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
82 -&#13;
This involves dependence on imported managers, heavy expenditure on managerial&#13;
education, and leads to an apparent dearth of managerial and entrepreneurial&#13;
talent, and, often, a scale of production that is disproportionate to&#13;
market size leading to oligopoly/monopoly and excess capacity.&#13;
Another important determinant of the characteristics of new tech-&#13;
niques is the technology already in use.. This imposes demands on any new&#13;
technique, in terms of scale and characteristics of output, if the output is to&#13;
serve as inputs-elsewhere in the system, and determines the availability and&#13;
nature of inputs. The technology in use in most advanced countries demands&#13;
standardization and reliability. The net result of the many connections&#13;
between different parts of the productive system is that there is (within&#13;
broad limits) technological determinism; techniques which do not fit in&#13;
become inefficient, not because thvy are absolutely inefficient, but because&#13;
they are inefficient within the context of the technology in use. As far&#13;
as LDCs are concerned, this means that their choice is much more circumscribed&#13;
than might appear.  Having made an initial decision to adopt some part of&#13;
modern technology, this often dictates that other parts should also be&#13;
adopted. Hence, while a careful study of available choice of techniques&#13;
suggests that the choice is reasonably extensive, the real choice in the con-&#13;
text of a particular technology and market system may be much narrower.&#13;
To summarize briefly: techniques designed for modern advanced&#13;
countries tend to produce high-income products, require high levels of&#13;
investible resources per employee, high levels of education and skills, be&#13;
of a large scale and require sophisticated management techniques, be asso-&#13;
ciated with high levels of labor productivity, and be linked, through inputs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -&#13;
and outputs, with the rest of the alvanced technelogy syatem. If these&#13;
techniques are transferred unmodified to LDCs, the result will be a con-&#13;
centration of resources, of savings and expenditure on human resources and&#13;
infrastructure, on a small part of the economy. Iitcomes will tend to be&#13;
concentrated in this area, leading to markecs for the high-income products&#13;
the system produces. Resources available in the lou-income country will&#13;
tend to be underutilized, including raw materials as well as labor.&#13;
Many of the well-established characteristics of the dual economy&#13;
can be seen as following from the characteristics of advanced country tech-&#13;
nology: the capital-intensity of productive techniques, the heavy reliance&#13;
on imported managers, skill deficiencies, un and underemployment and a rela-&#13;
tive (often absolute) deprivation of the economy outside the modern sector.&#13;
Only economies which are growing very rapidly and are selective about the&#13;
choice of techniques and adept at modifying them are able to overcome this&#13;
dualism, by absorbing a growing proportion of their workforce into the&#13;
modern sector. South Korea and Taiwan provide the obvious examples. In&#13;
other economies, dualistic tendencies have been partially offset by a&#13;
deliberate attempt to protect the non-modern sector, providing it with&#13;
resources and protected markets to prevent it being undermined by the&#13;
modern sector. This is the policy of 'walking on two legs' pursued most&#13;
extensively by China (and to a less marked extent by India). In China&#13;
employment expansior. in the modern sector has been similar to that in many&#13;
other developing economies, lagging well behind growth in output, while the&#13;
technology adopted has tended to be capital intensive.-/Overall employment&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84 -&#13;
policies have succeeded because of the absorption of labor in the agricultural&#13;
and rural non-agricultural sectors.&#13;
There is a growing body of literature that questions the rather&#13;
simplistic technological determinist argument advan~ced above. It is argued&#13;
that in many industries a wide choice of efficient technologies has been&#13;
established by empirical research.-/Recently, Pack has argued that countries&#13;
could make significant gains at the macro-level in terms of employment, out-&#13;
put and savings, by policies leading to the adoption of the most appropriate&#13;
techniques in existence. It has long been established that there is con-&#13;
siderable potential for labor intensity in ancilliary processes, even if the&#13;
2/&#13;
core technology is more fixed.-' Old techniques from advanced countries&#13;
offer more labor intensive and small-scale alternatives than the most recent&#13;
techniques. While this sort of argument supports the view that there is&#13;
a wider range of choice than the completely determinist view implies, other&#13;
czonsiderations suggest that the potential for selecting labor intensive tech-&#13;
niques may be exaggerated by calculations based on the micro-case stixies.&#13;
In the first place, many of the *studies show that considerations of product&#13;
standards/characteristics may rule out the labor-intensive technologies.-/&#13;
Secondly, the labor intensive techriques are often only economic at small&#13;
scale.-/ Thirdly, entrepreneurs dlo not have information about the complete&#13;

'shelf' of technicues in existence; their access to inforimation aoout diffe-&#13;
rent techniques denends on theiz channels of information. There tends to&#13;
be a bias in chiannels of information towards technology currently in use in&#13;
the supplying countries - i.e. the advanced countries. Appropriate tech-&#13;
niques, which are often older techniques fro1n advanced countries, or tech-&#13;
niques recently developed in LDCs are less well promoted.&#13;
Fourthly, many of the studies neglect the determinants of choice&#13;
or selection mechanisms. It is often assumed that the only relevant selec-&#13;
tion mechanism is the relative price of capital and labor, and t.±at is in&#13;
the control of the government.  In fact, the determinants of choice are far&#13;
more complex.  The nature and scale of the market is one critical deter-&#13;
minant. Products sold on the international market or to high-income consumers&#13;
may need to use the most recent technology in order to compete.-L/ Because&#13;
scale of production and the nature of the market are of importance in deter-&#13;
mining choice of product and technique, the factors determining these are&#13;
significant. Income distribution and trading strategy help determine the&#13;
nature and scale of markets for different types of product. The distribu-&#13;
tion of investible resources between enterprises of different size and type&#13;
2/&#13;
is also of relevance.- The very substantial wage differentials between&#13;
enterprises of different sizes suggests that the real wage level may be&#13;
outcome as well as (partial) cause of technological choice. Moreover, a&#13;
1/ Cooper et. al (1975) show that the more labor-intensive techniques may&#13;
have to be ruled out for 'certain quality demanding segments of the market'.&#13;
Sercovich shows in case studies in Argentina that firms were frequently&#13;
forced to abandon attempts to use local technology by the need to compete&#13;
in product differentiation to maintain their share of the market. High&#13;
quality products are not invariably produced with capital intensive technology.&#13;
In Egypt, El-Karanshawy found that it was the capital-intensive methods of&#13;
producing carpets that found it difficult to find an international market.&#13;
The processing zones use modern but labor intensive techniques to produce&#13;
exports.&#13;
2/ See evidence on how choice of technique varies with size of enterprise in&#13;
World Bank (1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
number of recent studies of technological choice have shown that the most&#13;
rational choices - both in terms of profit maximization and appropriate-&#13;
ness of techniques are sometimes rejected in favor of less profitable and&#13;
less appropriate techniques.-L/ Thus investigation of the decision mechanisms&#13;
involved is required if choice of technique is to be altered in a more appro-&#13;
priate direction.&#13;
Fifthly, the studies establishing a range of choice are essen-&#13;
tially static, depicting the situation at the point in time when they were&#13;
made. But the so-called 'shelf' is moving as technical change p.-oceeds,&#13;
and some parts of the shelf are moving much faster than others. In parti-&#13;
cular, with the current world balance of R. and D., the modern capital&#13;
intensive part of the shelf is moving forward, in te.ms of new products and&#13;
efficiency of technique, as compared with the labor intensive part; and the&#13;
'modern' end is also getting increasingly capital-intensive, larger scale,&#13;
and the products more sophisticated as incomes rise in the advanced coun-&#13;
tries. Thus while there may be scope for some push in the direction of&#13;
labor intensity and other dimensions of appropriateness in some products,&#13;
the aggregate effects are liKely to be swamped by dynamic changes in the&#13;
opposite direction.&#13;
Policies to Secure More Appropriate Technology&#13;
More appropriate technology may be roughly defined as technology&#13;
whose resource use is more in keeping with LDC resource availability, and&#13;
whose products are more suited to low-income consumers. This means that&#13;
more appropriate technology will be more labor intensive, less skill intensive&#13;
1/ See studies of Tlmmer et. al (1975), and Pickett et. al (1974),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
smaller scale, use more local materials, and produce sim'ler low-income&#13;
products than most of advanced counitry technology currently being transferred&#13;
to low-income countries.-/ Technology m.y be more appropriate ir. one respect,&#13;
and no more so in others; or more in some respects, less in others.  It is&#13;
then a matter of judgment as to whether it is to be preferred. More appro-&#13;
priate technology may be less efficient, either in the economic sense that&#13;
it is less profitable, (socially and/privately), or in the stricter sense&#13;
(which has been defined as technical inefficiency) that it uses more of all&#13;
resources to produce the same output. If it is socially or technically&#13;
2/&#13;
inefficient as compared with the 'inappropriate' alternative, then the&#13;
economy would suffer from some output loss in adopting it. In such a situa-&#13;
tion it would only be worthwhile adopting if it were believed that learning&#13;
effects would be such as to outweigh initial inefficiency, or that income&#13;
distribution and similar effects are such as to outweigh the loss in output.&#13;
If we assume that these effects may be incorporated into the measure of&#13;
social efficiency (and that we can give some meaning to this concept), then&#13;
an economy should only adopt more appropriate techniques if they can be shown&#13;
to be socially efficient. In discussing ways in which appropriate technology&#13;
1/ Some of the characteristics of 'appropriate technologyt briefly described&#13;
above (for a fuller discussion see Stewart (1977), Chapter.4) have been&#13;
subject to considerable debate; probably most controversial are tvo - the&#13;
question of scale and that of 'appropriate' products. The Strathclyde&#13;
research believes that scale is irrelevant to appropriateness. Above it&#13;
is defined as one criterion among others, on the grounds that small-scale&#13;
productive units are more in keeping with the entrepreneurial and managerial&#13;
abilities and market size of most LDCs. The appropriateness of products&#13;
is also left out of the Strathclyde discussion - and of most of the case&#13;
studies examining choice of technique. It is included here for reasons&#13;
discussed above.&#13;
2/ Both these concepts present problems - which may be extremely serious in&#13;
deciding whether a particular technology is efficient in one or other&#13;
senses.  But it fs a useful. shorthand here, to indicate that efficiency&#13;
is an important censideral:ion, but one that needs to be qualified to&#13;
include income distributioni and lecrning effects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -&#13;
may be promoted, it is assumed that what is in question is the promotion of&#13;
socially efficient appropriate technology.&#13;
Broadly, one may distinguish two types of appropriate technology:&#13;
appropriate technology for the 'modern' sector, which consists in the adap-&#13;
tion of modern sector advanced country technologies in more labor intensive&#13;
directions; and appropriate technology for the traditional sector, which&#13;
upgrades and improves traditional technologies.  Both have been neglected&#13;
in terms of information collection and dissemination, research and develop-&#13;
ment.  Promotion of more appropriate. technology in both categories may&#13;
involve improvements in information dissemination, minor or major modifica-&#13;
tion of existing techniques, or the development of entirely new techniques&#13;
and products. For completeness perhaps a third category should be included:&#13;
more appropriate systems of public services, including more appropriate&#13;
products and delivery systems.&#13;
It is difficult to establish orders of priority for the various&#13;
categories, and perhaps unnecessar.y to do so. The potential for improve-&#13;
ments in the traditional-technology area are great, given the almost com-&#13;
plete neglect in the past; this area is likely to help those in greatest&#13;
poverty more directly than modifications in modern sector tecnnology.&#13;
Successful innovations in this area should improve the productivity of the&#13;
poorest and, if widely disseminated, could reach very large numbers of&#13;
people. Appropriate innovations in the modern sector would speed up growth&#13;
of employment in this sector but are unlikely to improve the lives of most&#13;
of the very poor-, in the short run: in essence they are likely to expand&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -&#13;
the numbers in aiddle-income occupaticns..  Innovations ,.n this araa have to&#13;
compete with simultaneous R. and D. in developed countries, which -ay render&#13;
the results obsolete - particulaily where there is Droduct innQoetion and&#13;
competition in trade - and may also make it difficult to ensure that the&#13;
appropriate techniques are widely adopted. On the other hand, if a process&#13;
of innovation were engendered In this sector, it could become self-sustained,&#13;
leading to learning by doing and further innovation.-/ In so far as LDCs'&#13;
ultimate future lies in the modern sector, then innovation here may be&#13;
critical.  Since the bulk of investment is likely to remain in the modern&#13;
sector in middle-income countries, innovatiDns related to this sector would&#13;
be likely to affect a larger proportion of investment. Appropriate innova-&#13;
tion in the modern sector is also vital if developirg countries are to&#13;
avoid having to follow future technological developments in the advanced&#13;
councries, which are likely to be in an increasingly inappropriate direction.&#13;
Policies to promote appropriate techrology may be roughly categorized&#13;
into those that affect the demand for different types of technology ai.d those-&#13;
that affect the supply.&#13;
A different set of policies, with respect both to demand and&#13;
supply, is relevant to promoting appropriate technology according to the&#13;
sector being considered: this is because the three sectors - traditional,&#13;
modern industrial, and public sector - contain different types of decision&#13;
maker, with different objectives, consLrsirits and capacities. Among obvious&#13;
differences, the naLule ot iuaz'ets serv(. d differs between traditional and&#13;
1/ As appears to 1-ir1e happened, for t   ;.le, in the case of the Swaraj&#13;
tractor - see. Morehouse (1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -&#13;
modern sectors and consequently the type of product in demand; the size of&#13;
investible resources and managerial capacities differ so that different&#13;
scales of production occur; factor prices and access to technology differs,&#13;
with the traditional sector facing low labor costs and high capital costs,&#13;
while often in the modern sector capital is subsidized and labor costs&#13;
(relative at least to the traditional sector) are high. In the modern sector,&#13;
there are normally strong links with foreign sources of technology. The&#13;
links are weak or non-existent in the traditional sector. All these factors&#13;
affect the selection of technology.&#13;
In the modern sector in many countries, as many studies suggest&#13;
as well as much casual evidence, changes are needed in selection mechanisms&#13;
as well as in information/development related to appropriate technology. In&#13;
the traditional sector, information, education and credit is requiired. The&#13;
sectors also differ in their potential capacity to generate the information&#13;
search and technology development themselves. For the most part, the tradi-&#13;
tional sector lacks the capacity for self-generation and new technologies&#13;
must be developed from outside, but with strong links with the potential&#13;
users.-/ The need for,outside institutional support applies to information&#13;
collection as well as technology development. But the modern industrial&#13;
sector in many countries is potentially capable of doing a considerable por-&#13;
tion of the search and research itself, and would'benefit in terms of take-&#13;
up of the results and learning effects by so doing. In this sector, then&#13;
what is needed is an incentive structure and support system for internally&#13;
11 As for example in the work of ASTRA in Bangalore.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -&#13;
generated activities.  Efforts of independent instituticns financed from&#13;
outside often fail because they are not nsed by local entrepreneurs.&#13;
Most of the policies affecting demand are internal to particular&#13;
countries. They include changes in income distribution, which affects the&#13;
monetary demand for different types of product; changes in trading strategy,&#13;
which similarly affects demand for different types of product; changes in&#13;
credit/tax policy affecting the control over investible resources of different&#13;
types of decision maker; and changes in factor prices. Government policy&#13;
towards consumer demand - e.g. educption of consumers, limitations on advertis-&#13;
ing, policies towards trademarks - also affect choice of products and tech-&#13;
nique; and in the very large number of decisions over which government has&#13;
1/&#13;
direct control, the govcrnment may directly affect the choice of technology.-&#13;
Mast 6f these changes, as stated, are internal: only trading strategy has&#13;
a direct international dimension. Here there are a number of options:&#13;
a. The classic import substitution strategy. This normally&#13;
amounts to import reproduction rather than import substitu-&#13;
tion, and since it involves complete replication of goods&#13;
previotsly imported, it also involves replication of methods&#13;
of production. The consequence is capital-intensity of pro-&#13;
duction and inappropriate p*roducts.&#13;
1/ Little systematic research has been done comparing state and private&#13;
sector decision making with respect to choice of technique. The limited&#13;
evidence available suggests that state corporations in mixed economies&#13;
choose at least as inappropriate technology as the private sector (see&#13;
El-Karanshawy for a study of carpet weaving in Egypt where the State-owned&#13;
firm was introducing mechanized methods to compete with traditional hand-&#13;
woven methods in the private sector). It also appears that the State&#13;
sector is more lilkely to depend on foreign sources of technonlnv than&#13;
private nationally-owned firms - see MIytelka (1978) and Morehouse (1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -&#13;
b. Export orientation, particularly towards the North. This,&#13;
at least in the short run, should involve a more labor&#13;
intensive technology (although not the production of more&#13;
appropriate productis) than the straight I-S policy. As&#13;
time proceeds, s0 long as innovation remains the virtual&#13;
monopoly of the North, the policy is likely to. require&#13;
continual adjustmenit and increasing capital-intensity,&#13;
but of a lesser extent than a policy of progressive I-S,&#13;
which keeps up with the latest product developments in&#13;
the North.&#13;
c.  Appropriate import substitution - i.e. the substitution&#13;
of locally produced 'appropriate' goods for those pre-&#13;
viously imported. To some extent, this was the policy of&#13;
Japan in the thirties, and of China in the 1960s and 1970s.&#13;
The technology and products should be more appropriate,&#13;
but there may be losses in inefficiency because of the&#13;
absence of modern research into appropriate productsi/and&#13;
because of restrictions on trade. It is really only feasible&#13;
for large countries.&#13;
1/ Japan was able to avoid this source of inefficiency by taking 'modernt&#13;
products and modifying them. See UNCTAD (1978a).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 93 -&#13;
d.  South-South trading links :ombined with a polic- to promote&#13;
appropriate products and techliiques and to restrict the import&#13;
of inappropriate products and techniques. This is likely to&#13;
involve reorientation of trading strategy in manufactures away&#13;
from North-South to South-South. The option is similar to&#13;
appropriate import substitution but it i3 on a South basis, rather&#13;
than that of a single country. -/ It thus enables the South to&#13;
exploit the advantages of international trade, while maintaining&#13;
South protection, and increasing the appropriateness of technology.&#13;
The South-South trading relationship would include trade in technology&#13;
and capital goods. There are various degrees of stringency with&#13;
which this option may be pursued. At one extreme, it requires com-&#13;
plete delinking with the North, apart from primary production. At&#13;
the other, it involves greater preference on a South-South basis&#13;
but without further restrictions on North-South trading links.&#13;
Current moves to promote South-South links are in line &#156;iith the&#13;
latter strategy.&#13;
1/ Paul Streeten drew my attention to the pertinent quotation from D. H. Robertson:&#13;
(Robertson was discussing-trade between the U. S. and the U.K.).&#13;
"The simple fellow who, to the advantage of both, has been earning a living&#13;
by cooking the dinner for a busy and prosperous scientist, wakes up one day&#13;
to find that his master has invested in a completely automatic cooker, and that&#13;
if he wants to remain a member of the household he must turn shoe-black. He&#13;
acquires a kit and learns the techniques, only to find that his master has&#13;
invented a dust-repelling shoe, but would nevertheless be graciously willing&#13;
for him to remain on an empty the trash-bins . Would he not do better to remove&#13;
himself from the orbit of the great man and cultivate his own back garden? And&#13;
if he can find some other simple fellows in the same boat with whom to gang up&#13;
and practice the division of labor on a less bewildering basis, so much the better&#13;
for him."&#13;

The supply of different technologies:   a false, but nonetheless&#13;
helpful distinction is often made between information/research and development.&#13;
The distinction is false because information collection merges into search,&#13;
and search into research. I/ There are weaknesses, absolutely and relative&#13;
to what is happening at the inappropriate end of the technology spectrum, in&#13;
each of these activities in relation to appropriate technology.&#13;
Information&#13;
Commercial channels provide the mair. sources of information to&#13;
entrepreneurs in the Third World: for the most part, these are developed&#13;
country sources - TNCs, consultants, machinery salesmen - all of whom are&#13;
far more familiar with, and are more likely to benefit from investment decisions&#13;
incorporating fairly recent techniques designed in and for advanced countries.-&#13;
rhere are a growing number of voluntary bodies who try to provide information&#13;
services in relation to appropriate technology, but their efforts are small,&#13;
somewhat amateurish, and they are not incorporated into the main stream of&#13;
1/  For example, the Strathclyde study in collecting information about the&#13;
existing range of technical change devoted a minimum of two people for one&#13;
year to the process. As they devised 'synthetic' alternatives to those&#13;
techniques already in existence (i.e., new combinations of existing processes),&#13;
their efforts came closer to research than search. To establish the viability&#13;
of some of the new synthetic combinations would require testing, etc., essentially&#13;
a development activity.&#13;

field.&#13;
It is clear that there is a need for a more systematic system of&#13;
information collection and dissemination in relation to appropriate technology.&#13;
A number of proposals for such a system have been put forward. 4/  Some are of&#13;
the data bank variety. Others consist of an information cum consultancy service. It&#13;
seems the latter are more likely to be effective, as data banks are difficult to&#13;
use, and do not provide the essential software advice which is needed. The&#13;
most promising proposal for international action was that developed in the World&#13;
Bank: the technology referral service. -/ Promotion of Third World sources&#13;
of technology is another important aspect of policies to promote information&#13;
sources of more appropriate technology. Although Third World capital goods&#13;

does a detailed comparison of Indian and other TNCs and finds that their&#13;
technology is more appropriate (i.e., more labor intensive, on a smaller&#13;
scale and produces simpler products).. Wells (1979) finds LDC firms' invest-&#13;

intensive industries and in industries witlh less product differentiation.&#13;
3/ It is widely claimed that the capital goods industries in Brazil, India&#13;
and also South Korea ishow very little adaptation as compared with capital&#13;
goods industries in advanced countries. See Pack (1978b) and Stewart&#13;

industries have been castegised for failing to be 'appropriate' and to innovate,&#13;
on balance they are probably more appropriate than most advanced country&#13;
technologies; and they may become more so in the future, as innovation is&#13;
encouraged.&#13;
The promotion of Third World sources of technology is largely a matter&#13;
of internal policy of developing countries and of their trade and technology&#13;
regulations vis-a-vis other Third World countriep. Developed countries may&#13;

their aid policies, and by relaxing aid tying to include machinery bought from&#13;

The Development of AppropriFtez Technology&#13;
Scme appropriace. technologies have been developed in the developed&#13;
countries, while much current R. and D. in LDCs is tnot directed at the&#13;
development of appropriate technology. Hence, one could conclude that R. and D.&#13;
in LDCs is neither necessary nor sufficient for the development of appropriate&#13;
technology. Nonetheless, there are very strong arguments favoring developing&#13;
appropriate technology Ln LDCs; first, because the learning effects would then&#13;
be generated within the developing countries; secondly, because links with LDC&#13;
entrepreneurs are easier to maintain; thirdly, because resource costs and&#13;
availability of developing countries are more likely to be incorporated in the&#13;
design of the new technologies. For example, although there was no explicit inten-&#13;
tion to develop appropriate technology, the indigenous development of an Indian&#13;
tractor involved far lower capital costs than advanced country technology. The&#13;
aim, therefore, should be to promote a process of research, development and&#13;
technical change in developing countries which will produce more appropriate&#13;
technologies. This aim is in line with t:he objective of creating technological&#13;
capacity in LDCs. While this does not exclude all efforts in developed countries,&#13;
it indicates where the main thrust should be. The best way of generating this&#13;
process of technological change will vary according to sector and to country.&#13;
Among LDCs there are very marked differences in current technological capacity.&#13;
Some countries - particularly among the human resource rich middle-income countries&#13;
(but also including India) - have many of the inputs required to generate such&#13;
change.  Others lack institutional capacity, and human resources. -  Given these&#13;
marked differences in capacity, there is a dilemma: one possibility would be to con-&#13;
centrate efforts in those areas where the resources are already present, encouraging&#13;
X/  For a discussion of obstacles to technical change for a   rr±ate So_noogy&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 98 -&#13;
the export of appropriate technology from them to other less well endowed&#13;
countries. Unavoidably, this will form one aspect of a strategy to promote&#13;
appropriate technology; but in order to aioid new forms of dependency emerging&#13;
within the Third World, and to generate the technological capacity essential&#13;
for long-run development, effort:s to promote appropriate technological change&#13;
should also be promoted in the resource-deficient areas.&#13;
Clearly, relevant policies will differ in the two cases, as may&#13;
relevant technologies. In some ways the distinction is similar to that made&#13;
earlier between developing technology for the modern sector and that for the&#13;
traditional sector. In the middle-income human resource rich countries, for&#13;
the most part the technologies may be developed using internal resources.&#13;
International assistance may be required in a catalytic way to induce current&#13;
institutions to redirect their efforts to appropriate technology./   Much&#13;
of the earlier discussion on the development of technological capacity is&#13;
relevant here (see pp. 61-73). It was suggested there that a three pronged&#13;
po' cy was required, consisting of selectivity towards technology imports,&#13;
changing the legal and marketing system so as to favor local technology,&#13;
and promotion of local developmenits through provision of infrastructure govern-&#13;
ment subsidies, incentives and so on. Especial attention needs to be placed on&#13;
securing strong links with the productive sector preferably by getting the&#13;
research and development carried out within firms.  Specific tax and incentive&#13;
policies may be effective. For (eample, in Peru, a tax of 2% is levied on&#13;
net pre-tax income of industrial firms which is used to finance central research.&#13;
The tax is repaid to firms who use it to finance R. and D.; the net proceeds go&#13;

effort required.&#13;

.1 99 -&#13;
to finance a cenwral f'und f'.r R. and D.-I A recen. suvrey!  found that 60%&#13;
of the Peruvian fl'rms sampled engaged in R. and D. compared wj.th 11% of firms&#13;
izlncuador and 23% of Colombian firms, which may indicate the effectiveness&#13;
of the incentive.&#13;
The results of such R. and D. may not be appropriate according to&#13;
all, or even sometimes any, of the criteria discussed above. But as argued&#13;
above, it Is likely to result in more appropriate technology than much imported&#13;
unmodified technology../ This is because local costs and resource availability&#13;
unavoidably influence technology design, even when there is no conscious&#13;
intention to do achieve this. But much depends on the structure of incentives&#13;
and markets within the economy. If the market is protected, market share&#13;
depends on differentiated modern advanced country products, and factor prices&#13;
are 'distorted,' then locally-generated technologies may not-be substantially&#13;
different-from imported technologies.  This is'especially likely if the import&#13;
-of foreign technology is not restricted.  -But with a more appropriate set of&#13;
-selection mechanisms, more appropriate results are likely.&#13;
International assistance may be needed to-help provide resources of&#13;
both finance and manpower to create institutions to promote appropriate&#13;
4/&#13;
,technology in the traditional sector.-&#13;

2/ Mytelka (1978)&#13;
3/  In the case of t'he local development of technology to make a tractor in India,&#13;
the capital costs were estimated to be about half that of the imported&#13;
technology, for the same level of output.  An indigenously designed casting&#13;
process involved Rs. 1,000 in contrast to Rs. 500,000 in imported equipment.&#13;
(Morehouse, 1978).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 100 -&#13;
In countries lacking irLstitutional or human capacity for technical&#13;
change, much more outside assistance will be required, initially, to generate&#13;
local appropriate technologies. In these countries, the immediate prospects&#13;
may not be very good, but the efforts are worthwhile to generate the local&#13;
learning process.&#13;
Many proposals have been put forward for international assistance for the&#13;
development of appropriate technology. -/ The most developed proposal, at this&#13;
stage, is the proposed International Mechanism for Appropriate Technology. The&#13;
feasibility study on this, defines IMAT's activities as essentially catalytic,&#13;
raising funds and providing assistance to national efforts in LD.w's.&#13;
Efforts to develop appropriate technology need to be accompanied&#13;
by improvements in the dissemination of information so that the results may&#13;
be widely commuicated.&#13;
Development and communication of appropriate technology hardware forms&#13;
only a small part of the changes needed: as already suggested, changes in&#13;
slIection mechanisms are essential, so that newly developed approprit:e technology&#13;
is used. Moreover, there is what is known as the software element in the use&#13;
of technology, i.e., all the managerial and associated services which may be&#13;
ill-adapted to the new technology, and which must be adapted or it will fail.&#13;
Social/cultural and political obstacles to the use of appropriate technology are&#13;
sometimes argued to be of greater importance than the availability of hardware.&#13;

VIi.  Some Conclusions&#13;
1.     In recent years, there has c'eveloped wide3pread recognition of&#13;
the need to regulate the inflow of foreign technology into developing&#13;
countries from advanced countries.  This recognition has arisen from the&#13;
growing evidence that unrestricted transfer has involved high costs,&#13;
has restricted the independence of decision makers, has limited the&#13;
learning effects of technology transfer, and has inhibited the development&#13;
of local technological capacity. An active policy regulating the inflow&#13;
of technology is necessary to mitigate these effects. Recognition of the&#13;
need to regulate the inflow has been largely independent of the question&#13;
of appropriate technology and is shared by many countries which place&#13;
little emphasis on appropriate technology.&#13;
2.     Despite some overlap, policies designed to improve the terms&#13;
of technology transfer should be distinguished from those designed to&#13;
protect and promote 'Local technological developments. Most emphasls,&#13;
to date, has been placed on policies to regulate the terms.&#13;
3.     An essential feature of the technology market is that it is&#13;
imperfect - natural and legal imperfections enable the 'owners' of&#13;
technological knowledge to appropriate returns to this knowledge. These&#13;
imperfections - whiclh are normally justified as necessary to generate&#13;
adequate returns to research and development - mean that the price levied&#13;
tends to be oligopolistic and subject to bargaining.&#13;
4.     Policies designed to improve the terms of technology transfer&#13;
may be mandatory, or rely on incentives and persuasion. There are&#13;
broadly two areas of policy: one, is aimed at decreasing the packaging&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 102 -&#13;
of technology transfer so as to increase local bargaining power, to&#13;
reduce dependence and learn how to put the package together locally,&#13;
and to make control over terms easier; the other is improving the terms&#13;
of transfer of each form of technology transfer. As policies towards&#13;
depackaging become effective, regulation of the terms of unpackaged&#13;
transfer becomes important. The tax system may be designed to improve&#13;
the terms of transfer, in both packaged and unpackaged form. National&#13;
registration of technology contracts, together with requirements regulating&#13;
the terms and outlawing restrictive practices before registration is&#13;
permitted,and prohibiting duplicative imports,improve the terms of&#13;
unpackaged transfers. Some countries have made very significanc foreign&#13;
exchange gains by such policies w,hich would appear easily to justify&#13;
the administrative costs involved. However, it is not yet clear that&#13;
the de jure regulations (e.g. outlawing various restrictions) are always&#13;
carried out de facto. Regulations do not cover the many informal transfers&#13;
mechanisms, which may be of greater total significance than formal mechanisms.&#13;
5.     Policies which regulate the terms of technology inflow will 'e&#13;
insufficient to prumote local technological development. Countries&#13;
whici have local technological potential need an active policy to promote&#13;
local technological change.  Such a policy includes positive promotional&#13;
measures - such as the provision of infrastructure, subsidies and tax&#13;
incentives, education and government procurement policies - and a selective&#13;
policy towards t'e import of foreign technology. Such a selective policy&#13;
involves the discriminating import of foreign technology in those areas&#13;
where local potential exists, by encouraging the import of technology which&#13;
is likely to generate local learning and innovation and is complementary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 103 -&#13;
with local efforts, and restricting it where it is competitive with local&#13;
capacity and is likely to inhibit it. The combination of positive&#13;
incentives and selectivity towards foreign tachnology was the successful&#13;
strategy of Japan; similar policies are now being initiated in S. Korea,&#13;
although regulations towards technology imports appear to be liberally&#13;
interpreted. This combination of policies has been adopted successfully for&#13;
particular technological developments elsewhere. But many LDCs which have&#13;
the potential (i.e., human resource rich countries) for technological capacity&#13;
are underusing it, and continuing to rely primarily on foreign technology,&#13;
which is allowed free entry, so long as the costs are not excessive. There is&#13;
a sharp contrast in the protection given the local production of goods by&#13;
many countries with the lack of protection to local technology. Selective poli-&#13;
cies of this kind need considerable administrative and technical expertise; they&#13;
bsould be introduced on an industry-by-industry basis, where strong potential&#13;
local technological capacity exists.&#13;
6. The system of patents and trademarks tends to give protection *o foreign&#13;
technology suppliers. International reform of the patent system to avoid this&#13;
is currently-in process of negotiation.   But        the question of patents is&#13;
probably of less significance than that of trademarks. Trademarks tend to&#13;
reinforce the technological dominance of foreign suppliers arid contribute to&#13;
inappropriate consumption patterns. LDC trademarks are relatively undeveloped,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 104 -&#13;
although they formed half new registrations in 1974. To promote local technology&#13;
it is necessary to reduce the dominant position of foreign trademarks.  A vari-&#13;
ety of policies are possible ranging from total restrictions to financial in-&#13;
centives. It is difficult to devise a system which preserves the benefits -&#13;
as quality guarantor - of trademarks, while reducing the costs they impose.&#13;
7. Although many of tht policies towards technology inflow must, in the final&#13;
analysis, be pursued at the national level, there is considerable potential for&#13;
international cooperative action. International cooperation in the exchange&#13;
of information may strengthen each country's knowledge of alternatives and&#13;
practices elsewhere. The international (or regional) harmonisation of practices&#13;
with respect to transfer pricing, taxation and regulation of technology&#13;
contracts will prevent any single country losing a disproportionate share of&#13;
foreign technology inflow, which might occur if they act alone. International&#13;
action may work to identify alternatives to well known sources of technology.&#13;
Thi- may be particularly valuable for LDCs at an early stage of development,&#13;
which lack the capacity to search for alternatives and package the technology&#13;
for themselves. The ability to regulate the inflow of technology depends&#13;
on the level of development of the country concerned. Countries which have un-&#13;
dertaken active policies have been mainly middle income, with considerable ad-&#13;
ministrative and managerial capacity and local entrepreneurship.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 1.5 -.&#13;
8.  Local technological capacity in third world countries is o- critical impor-&#13;
tance:  first i. is a vital part of the development process.    Secondly, it is&#13;
necessary for independence ane to  iAprove bargaining power in relation to the&#13;
import of tecbnology. Thirdly, it is necessary to generate appropriate technical&#13;
change. While there appears to be a certain amount of technological choice&#13;
today, the continued concentration of technical change on advanced country&#13;
technology is likely to result in increasingly inappropriate techniques. Un-&#13;
less developing countries undertake R. and D. in alternative directions, the&#13;
choice of technology available in the future will be increasingly circumscribed,&#13;
and irrelevant to the needs of the world's poorest. The development of a con-&#13;
tinuous process of technological change - new techniques and products - in&#13;
an appropriate direction in the developing countries is essential if the choice&#13;
is to be widened.&#13;
9. Technology recently developed in advanced countries tends to be inappropriate,&#13;
in many respects, for many LDCs. This is because it is designed to meet the&#13;
needs of the advanced countries; it tends for example to be increasingly capital&#13;
intensive. Its use in poor countries involves a concentration of investment&#13;
resources in the modepn sector, exacerbating differentials and contributing to&#13;
the problems of unemployment and underemployment. Products designed for ad-&#13;
vanced country consumers are ill suited to meet the basic needs of poor&#13;
people.  However, the high productivity of much modern technology and the ef-&#13;
ficiency and economies of scale associated with advanced country products may&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 106 -&#13;
make the technology the best choice, given the absence of efficient alternatives.&#13;
Appropriate technology consists of technology more in line with developing coun-&#13;
try needs and resources; it consists of more labour intensive processes in the&#13;
modern sector, and the development of new and improved techniques and products for&#13;
the traditional sector. The promotion of more appropriate technology includes the&#13;
selection of more appropriate technology among known technologies (including&#13;
'old' techniques from advanced countries and second hand machinery) and the&#13;
development of new appropriate technologies.&#13;
10- The development strategy a country adopts strongly influence- its technolog-&#13;
ical options. If a country's consumption patterns are similar to those of&#13;
developed countries, and if its main trading orientation is with developed&#13;
countries, then the main body of technology it uses in the modern sector will need&#13;
to be that of the developed countries. Consumption patterns are likely to be&#13;
similar to those of developed countries among countries with an unequal income&#13;
distribution, an 'open' policy towards technological imports, and lac'; of in-&#13;
dipenous cultural factors which inhibit the demonstration effect. Some modi-&#13;
fication of technology is clearly possible - and indeed happensl/ - even in this&#13;
sort of situation, buIt modificationis are likely to be largely a matter of time-&#13;
lags in adopting the latest advanced country technology, more labour - inten-&#13;
sive ancilliary activities, and modifications rendered necessary by differences&#13;
in the size of market.-/&#13;
1/  See evidence of Pack (1976) on adaptation in Kenya.&#13;
2/ Scale has been established as the main source of adaptation among TNCS&#13;
(Reuber (1973).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
107 -&#13;
With more equal income distribution and with obstacles (cultural, economic or&#13;
legal) preventing the domination of advarLeed country products, the potential&#13;
for appropriate and self-generated teclnology will be greater. Trade in&#13;
manufactured products with advanced countries has generally involved the import&#13;
of technology from advanced countries, at least in the initial stage. Trade&#13;
between developing countries is more likely to be consistent with the use of&#13;
locally generated appropriate technology. Appropriate technology consists both&#13;
in modification in 'modern' sector products and techniques and in upgrading&#13;
'traditional' sector technology. Even in countries with advanced country&#13;
oriented modern sectors, there is potential for appropriate technology in the&#13;
traditional sector to help raise productivity and incomes and meet basic needs.&#13;
11. Policies to promote appropriate technology consist in policies determining&#13;
the demand for (or selection of) different products and techniques, and policies&#13;
determining the supply of technologies. On the demand side, the policies&#13;
concerned are chiefly national; they include determinants of income distribution&#13;
and consumption patterns, trading strategy, policies determining control over&#13;
investible resources by different types of decision maker, and relative factor&#13;
prices. On the supply side, they include the collection of information about&#13;
different technologies and its diffusion, and research and development and the&#13;
creation of new technologies. Potet;tially, there could be an important role for&#13;
international institutions on the supply side assisting in information collection&#13;
and diffusion, and in funding appropriate research.&#13;
12. Technology transfer between developing countries could have an important&#13;
role to play in increasing developing countries technological independence&#13;
and bargaining power and in promoting appropriate technology. There are&#13;
some indications that such trade is expanding; third world MNCs are developing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 108 -&#13;
as is third world consultancy and trade in capital goods. As with similar develop-&#13;
ments, there is a danger that new imbalances and dependencies within the third&#13;
world will arise as a result.&#13;
13. There is a complex system of relationships between past policy towards&#13;
technology, policy makers and policy making. Countries which have been heavily&#13;
dependent on foreign technology, particularly in the form of foreign investment,&#13;
find it more difficult to regulate it, than those which have relied on it to a&#13;
lesser extent and have maintained an arms length relationship with foreign&#13;
suppliers.    Similarly, patterns of production and consumption which are broad-&#13;
ly inappropriate set in force strong forces making for similar inappropriate&#13;
choices in the future.  The extent of current freedom of decision making depends&#13;
in-large part on past policies. Today's policies, then, will partly determine&#13;
future options. In this context radical delinking might be a tactical and tempo-&#13;
rary move to strengthen a country's position in future linked relationships.&#13;
1/ China's recent history can obviously be interpreted in this light.&#13;

            International technology transfer : issues
            and policy options
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Technology is a vital part of the
            development process, a necessary input into all activity.
            Because of the historical domination of research and
            development by developed countries, a very large part of the
            technology used is transferred from developed countries. The
            transfer raises four major issues: those of the costs of the
            transfer, the appropriateness of products and techniques
            which are transferred, the effects of the transfer on
            learning and technological development in LDCs, and the
            effects on independence. The paper considers the consequence
            of the transfer and the range of policies that might be
            adopted, nationally and internationally, in relation to each
            of these issues. It is argued that the appropriate policies
            will vary according to the stage of development of each
            country, its technological capacity and its own objectives.
            However, in general it is concluded that an active
            technology policy is called for if the costs associated with
            technology transfer are to be reduced and the benefits increased.
