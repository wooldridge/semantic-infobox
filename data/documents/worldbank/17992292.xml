                  v.   Rajagopalan Interview&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I'm William Becker with George washington University and&#13;
the Business History Group.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   And I'm David Milobsky from The World Bank Historian's&#13;
Office.&#13;
&#13;
A:   I am Rajagopalan, Vice President and Special Advisor,&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank.&#13;
Q:   Well thank you very much.    We'd like to begin the&#13;
&#13;
interview by asking you to describe briefly your educational&#13;
background.&#13;
&#13;
A:   I have a Civil Engineering Degree from the University of&#13;
&#13;
Madras in southern India.     And then I received a graduate&#13;
&#13;
degree in Sanitary Engineering, as it used to be called, from&#13;
&#13;
the Johns Hopkins University in 1954.     I got the Civil&#13;
Engineering Degree in 1949.     I also had some special training&#13;
&#13;
in Sanitary Engineering at Harvard and MIT.     I was brought to&#13;
&#13;
this country to be trained in Sanitary Engineering so that I&#13;
&#13;
can go back to India and become Professor of Public Health&#13;
&#13;
Engineering at the University of Madras.    While I was working&#13;
for the government, I also taught at the University of&#13;
&#13;
Madras.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   How did your career develop after receiving the post-&#13;
&#13;
graduate degree at Hopkins in 1954?&#13;
&#13;
A:   The Indian Embassy in Washington told me that the&#13;
&#13;
government of India was planning to organize a national water&#13;
&amp;#12;                                           v.   Rajagopalan, Page 2&#13;
supply and sanitation program for India and that they were&#13;
&#13;
looking for somebody to develop that program.       When I&#13;
&#13;
returned to India I was selected for this job.&#13;
&#13;
        Public water supply or the lack of it has always been a&#13;
&#13;
major problem in India, even during the British days.         In&#13;
&#13;
fact, people used to choose their place of living on the&#13;
&#13;
basis of the availability of water and the availability of&#13;
good schools for their children.&#13;
&#13;
        In India, only about six percent .of the population had&#13;
&#13;
access to safe drinking water in 1949.      So there was an&#13;
&#13;
urgent need to improve the situation.      There were hardly any&#13;
&#13;
well trained Sanitary Engineers in the Country.        I was sent&#13;
&#13;
abroad to receive training in sanitary engineering.&#13;
                    I&#13;
Q:   And then you spent the next, it must be close to 11&#13;
years, in those positions.     What, then, made you decide to&#13;
&#13;
come to the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
A:      That is an interesting question.   I did not decide to&#13;
&#13;
come to the World Bank.     I was asked to come to the World&#13;
&#13;
Bank.     What happened was the National Water Supply and&#13;
&#13;
sanitation program in India at that time was very successful.&#13;
&#13;
It was the largest Water supply and Sanitation program in the&#13;
&#13;
world and my professor here at the Johns Hopkins University,&#13;
&#13;
Dr. Abel Wolman was aware of it.     He was the foremost&#13;
&#13;
practioner in the field.     The Bank went to Dr. Wolman in&#13;
&amp;#12;                                          v. Rajagopalan, Page 3&#13;
&#13;
1964, in search of an expert to help them deal with problems&#13;
&#13;
they had with two troublesome water projects, in Dakka and&#13;
&#13;
Chittagong.     Dr. Wolman recommended me for the position.&#13;
&#13;
        Although Dr. Wolman's recommendation flattered me, I was&#13;
&#13;
not eager to leave India in order to work for the Bank. I&#13;
&#13;
knew that the Bank was a very reputable institution, but I&#13;
&#13;
wondered why the Bank wanted an engineer?     What does an&#13;
&#13;
engineer do in the bank?     Furthermore, in 1964 there was a&#13;
&#13;
World Bank mission called the Bell Mission in India.&#13;
Everything I had read in the newspapers in Delhi about the&#13;
&#13;
Bell Mission suggested not to have anything to do with the&#13;
&#13;
bank.     The Bank did not have a good name in India at that&#13;
time.     The Bell Mission had asked for, I think, devaluation&#13;
&#13;
and other unpopular measures.     All the newspapers were full&#13;
&#13;
of stories condemning the Bell Mission and the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
        However, the Finance Ministry, encouraged me to join the&#13;
&#13;
Bank saying "Look, this is the first time that the World-'Bank&#13;
&#13;
has asked someone from India by name.     It's a great honor."&#13;
&#13;
So I came here.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      So after you finally decided to come, what were the&#13;
&#13;
projects that you were first assigned to?&#13;
&#13;
A:      Well, my very first experience in the Bank was an odd&#13;
&#13;
one.     I was asked what I thought about the Dakka and&#13;
&#13;
Chittagong projects.     I read the appraisal reports.    I was&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        v. Rajagopalan, Page 4&#13;
&#13;
not diplomatic enough in those days, so I said, "Look, for&#13;
&#13;
this kind of money, you could have purchased those two&#13;
&#13;
cities."   That didn't sit well.   In the Bank there were not&#13;
that many staff members from developing countries.    I think I&#13;
&#13;
was probably the first non-Anglo-saxon engineer to be&#13;
recruited by the Bank.   There wasn't an Engineer from Japan,&#13;
&#13;
China, Latin America, Egypt or anywhere else.   There were, of&#13;
&#13;
course, a few economists, lawyers, financial analysts and&#13;
&#13;
accountants, but not technicians from .developing countries.&#13;
So it was a very odd thing to come here, because people were&#13;
&#13;
curious about who I was and how good I was as an Engineer.&#13;
&#13;
It was a strange experience.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    I&#13;
     I was put on a number of projects almost as a consultant&#13;
&#13;
during the first year.   The very first project I did was the&#13;
&#13;
Bujumbura water supply project in Burundi.    It had already&#13;
&#13;
been appraised.   It was ready to go to the board, but my'boss&#13;
&#13;
held it up and asked me to visit the project and report back&#13;
&#13;
to him my impressions about it.    I went there and felt that&#13;
&#13;
one can get the same results at a much lower cost.    The&#13;
&#13;
Belgians, who had built the original water supply system for&#13;
&#13;
this place had done a very good job.   They were tapping the&#13;
&#13;
clear spring water in the high hills and then gravitating it&#13;
&#13;
to the town.   The Bank's proposed project would pump the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         v. Rajagopalan, Page 5&#13;
water from an obvious source, Lake Tanganyika, and then&#13;
&#13;
purify it.    To purify the water, they needed chemicals such&#13;
&#13;
as chlorine and alum.    I said, "Look, this is a completely&#13;
landlocked country and everything has got to come by rail for&#13;
at least 400 miles--the chlorine, the alum, the fuel,&#13;
&#13;
everything.   Water supply is an essential service.    Why put&#13;
&#13;
an essential service in jeopardy like this, by making it&#13;
dependent on imports from abroad?     The logical thing to do is&#13;
&#13;
to gravitate water from the mountain springs."      I raised&#13;
some fundamental doubts about the project.    That also did not&#13;
&#13;
go over very well.&#13;
&#13;
     To the Bank's credit, it kept an open mind toward my&#13;
views on the Bujumbura project.     My logic was persuasive, and&#13;
                     I&#13;
my colleagues did not refrain from rethinking the project.&#13;
&#13;
They made it much simpler.    My success with the Bujumbura&#13;
&#13;
project led me to assignments on a number of other projects.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Of all of the projects that you were involved in, which&#13;
&#13;
did you think were the most important?&#13;
&#13;
A:   It's not a question of which is most important.     It's a&#13;
&#13;
question of where you make significant technical&#13;
&#13;
contributions.    I was asked to look at another project that&#13;
&#13;
was similar to Bujumbura.    A project had been appraised for&#13;
&#13;
Kingston, Jamaica, a water supply project, and my boss asked&#13;
&#13;
me to look at it before it went to the Board.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                           v. Rajagopalan, Page 6&#13;
&#13;
Howard Humphries of U.K. were the consultants on that&#13;
&#13;
project.     They had asked for funding for a spillway model&#13;
&#13;
study.     I was asked to go to Jamaica to review the study and&#13;
&#13;
to advice the Bank of the need for additional funds.&#13;
       The dam was originally intended to be a multi-purpose&#13;
&#13;
project which would provide irrigation water, flood control,&#13;
electric power and drinking water for Kingston and the&#13;
&#13;
surrounding areas.     I examined the project and I found it to&#13;
&#13;
be very expensive and unnecessary.      I .looked around Jamaica&#13;
&#13;
and talked to the people.     I asked them where they got their&#13;
&#13;
water.     They said, "If we want water we just stick a pipe&#13;
&#13;
into the ground and up comes clear water.       That is what we&#13;
do."  They obtained from ground-water millions of gallons&#13;
                   I&#13;
very easily.  I said, "Look, you don't want twenty million&#13;
&#13;
gallons all in one day.     The demand increases at the rate of&#13;
&#13;
two million gallons every year as population increases.        So&#13;
&#13;
why do you want to put in a massive dam like that on&#13;
&#13;
limestone?     It isn't viable.   It will leak like a sieve.      It&#13;
&#13;
is very expensive to build a dam in lime stone formations.&#13;
&#13;
Your cost estimates are very low.      And this will cost at&#13;
&#13;
least 100 million in 1965 dollars.''&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Who was proposing a project like this?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Howard Humphries had proposed it, but the World Bank was&#13;
&#13;
considering financing it as a multipurpose project because a&#13;
&amp;#12;                                          v. RajagopalaÂ·n, Page 7&#13;
&#13;
lot of studies had already taken place.     For six years they&#13;
&#13;
were operating on that basis.     I told the Bank management&#13;
&#13;
that the proposed project was not necessary and that ground&#13;
&#13;
water should be used.    During the previous 11 years, I had&#13;
done so many operations in India that I learned how to design&#13;
&#13;
water supply systems for different conditions in a way that&#13;
&#13;
was both effective and cost efficient.     This experience&#13;
&#13;
helped me greatly during those years at the Bank.     It enabled&#13;
&#13;
me to recognize when particular water supply projects were&#13;
&#13;
not well suited to their surroundings and to suggest more&#13;
&#13;
economical alternatives.     Howard Humphries, on the other&#13;
&#13;
hand, was used to doing things in a more traditional way.&#13;
&#13;
Nothing that they did was technically deficient but only it&#13;
                   I&#13;
was unnecessary and costly.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Would you say the same about this earlier project in&#13;
&#13;
Burundi?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes.   Exactly the same thing and then there was a&#13;
&#13;
project in Ghana.     Another U.N. special fund project from&#13;
&#13;
1959 to 1965 was going on there.     The U.N. had invested about&#13;
&#13;
six million dollars in the preparation of that project.        The&#13;
&#13;
master plan that had been prepared was estimated to cost&#13;
&#13;
about $440 million.     They wanted a huge dam and a host of&#13;
&#13;
other things.    It was totally uncalled for.   Once again we&#13;
&#13;
simplified it.   The consultants proposed to build a large-&#13;
&amp;#12;                                           V. Rajagopalan, Page 8&#13;
&#13;
scale, project, but this was not necessary.      As you can see,&#13;
&#13;
most of the projects that I worked on in my early Bank career&#13;
&#13;
were similar in character.       In the Burundi, Jamaica, and&#13;
&#13;
Ghana projects, the consultants were pushing large-scale,&#13;
technically complex, expensive projects when simpler, cheaper&#13;
&#13;
projects would've sufficed.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Now after these projects, in your career as aÂ· project&#13;
&#13;
officer, did you focus mainly on water and the sanitation?&#13;
&#13;
A:   I focused on water and sanitation initially.       I worked&#13;
&#13;
on a number of projects -- Nairobi, Zambia, Uganda, Tanzania,&#13;
&#13;
Brazil, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia.         Then in&#13;
&#13;
1972 I became a Division Chief.       I ran the division and&#13;
&#13;
supervised projects but I still maintained an engineering&#13;
                      i&#13;
interest in all of the projects.       In 1975 I became an&#13;
&#13;
Assistant Director.       Until then I was very much an engineer&#13;
&#13;
doing water supply projects.&#13;
&#13;
     When I became an Assistant Director, I was given&#13;
&#13;
responsibility for all sectors other than agriculture.         At&#13;
&#13;
that time my director friends advised me to leave water&#13;
&#13;
supply alone and focus on the other sectors.      This was very&#13;
&#13;
good advice.   I learned about all the other sectors,&#13;
&#13;
including development finance companies, education, health,&#13;
&#13;
population and urban development projects.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   So before you were promoted you concentrated primarily&#13;
&amp;#12;                                             v. Rajagopalah, Page 9&#13;
&#13;
on water projects?&#13;
&#13;
A:      Yes.   One thing I have done up to this date is to remain&#13;
an engineer, not only at heart but in reality also.       Keeping&#13;
&#13;
in touch with the field has been very helpful.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Would you say that other project officers had a&#13;
&#13;
technical and engineering approach to the projects in the 60s&#13;
&#13;
and 70s?&#13;
A:      Yes, in our sector, particularly, we had a very&#13;
&#13;
technical approach to projects.        We looked carefully into the&#13;
details and we really got into the designs.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Now, do you think in the 1980s there's been a change in&#13;
&#13;
that?&#13;
&#13;
A:      Very definitely.   There has been a change away from&#13;
                       I&#13;
looking into those,kinds of technical and engineering&#13;
&#13;
details.       Now the staff relies on consultants and accept&#13;
&#13;
whatever is given by consultants as the starting point&#13;
&#13;
without questioning, or really appraising.                      Â·-&#13;
Q:      What kind of consultants?   Managerial consultants?&#13;
&#13;
A:      No, engineering consultants.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Engineering consultants.&#13;
&#13;
A:      Suppose a road needs to be built from A to B.     The&#13;
&#13;
borrowing country's highways department will engage a&#13;
&#13;
consultant, a well known international consultant, and ask&#13;
&#13;
him to prepare a feasibility report.        The feasibility report&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         V. Rajagopalari, Page 10&#13;
&#13;
will be given to the Bank, and the Bank will review it and&#13;
&#13;
then say," Fine, it looks feasible.     Go ahead and do the&#13;
detailed engineering."    Then the consultants do the detailed&#13;
&#13;
design.   The Bank's engineers review it and if satisfied say,&#13;
&#13;
"okay, the cost estimates appear reasonable and the technical&#13;
&#13;
standards appear acceptable and you can go ahead on this&#13;
&#13;
basis."   Then they will recommend to the Bank that we are to&#13;
build this road or bridge or railway or whatever it is up to&#13;
&#13;
these standards, and that the cost estimate of X million&#13;
&#13;
dollars is reasonable.    They will also suggest that the Bank&#13;
&#13;
extend a loan to cover part of that cost estimate.     That is&#13;
&#13;
how the work is done.&#13;
     In the old days, the role of the engineer in this&#13;
                    I&#13;
process was to certify that he has spot checked the design&#13;
&#13;
and the cost estimate.    He tells the Bank management and the&#13;
&#13;
Board, "yes, this job can be done reasonably for this amount&#13;
&#13;
and it is up to the technical standards which are             Â·-&#13;
internationally accepted and it has been prepared by&#13;
knowledgeable and experienced people.     Therefore, the whole&#13;
&#13;
project is acceptable."&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Well, why was this changed?    It seems to me from what&#13;
&#13;
you are saying about some of these projects you worked on&#13;
&#13;
earlier that you found that consultants, even good&#13;
&#13;
consultants nevertheless make mistakes--serious mistakes.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                           V. RajagopalanÂ·, Page 11&#13;
Why would the Bank move from using its internal experts to&#13;
consultants from the outside?&#13;
&#13;
A:    I don't think anyone made a conscious decision to shift&#13;
&#13;
to a particular mode of operation.       Looking back, I can only&#13;
venture a guess.   During the heyday of the British Empire,&#13;
&#13;
the British had a lot of people working in various developing&#13;
&#13;
countries (i.e. their former colonies)       They worked on the&#13;
kinds of projects that the Bank was beginning to finance:&#13;
&#13;
water supplies, roads and bridges, railways, and agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
These people were mainly engineers and technicians.         They&#13;
knew the countries.       They knew the local situations.    They&#13;
&#13;
were preparing projects and doing development work.         After&#13;
&#13;
WWII and the breakup of the British Empire, these guys were&#13;
                      I&#13;
all available to work for the Bank and the Bank recruited&#13;
&#13;
them heavily in the 50s and 60s.&#13;
&#13;
     This pool of experienced people led to some high quality&#13;
&#13;
project work in the 1960s.       I'll use livestock as an example.&#13;
&#13;
If I needed an expert on livestock, we would have on our&#13;
&#13;
staff here an animal husbandry specialist, a livestock&#13;
&#13;
expert, who had been earlier the Director of Animal Husbandry&#13;
&#13;
in Kenya or in Malaysia.        He had run a department, and he&#13;
&#13;
knew his subject and was practically oriented.       When this guy&#13;
&#13;
went to a country, the people respected him, because he&#13;
&#13;
communicated well with the local livestock staff and&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         v. Rajagopalari, Page 12&#13;
&#13;
authorities.   He understood all the relevant issues.&#13;
&#13;
     Although the Bank experts were quite knowledgeable in&#13;
those days, they didn't know how to write a very good report.&#13;
&#13;
We were all in that category.     Nevertheless, we knew more&#13;
&#13;
about development than most of the consultants, since we were&#13;
well-trained technicians who had extensive experience in&#13;
&#13;
dealing with less developed countries.     There was much&#13;
respect for technical knowledge in the Bank.     That was its&#13;
&#13;
primary strength in those days.&#13;
&#13;
     When the Bank expanded rapidly, however, that pool of&#13;
&#13;
manpower resources began to erode.     Increased emphasis was&#13;
&#13;
placed on presentation, on fine report writing.     Technical&#13;
people are not very good at writing reports.     Only economists&#13;
                     I&#13;
are good at writing reports.     So the balance of power within&#13;
&#13;
the Bank was gradually shifting towards report writers and&#13;
&#13;
away from experienced people with knowledge of the relevant&#13;
&#13;
subjects.                                                   Â·.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Who are the consultants?     Who are the people working for&#13;
&#13;
the consultants?&#13;
&#13;
A:   The consultants are usually developed country&#13;
&#13;
consultants, and they don't always have the right background&#13;
&#13;
for preparing projects for developing countries.     I will give&#13;
&#13;
you an example.    I went to Chicago for an American Waterworks&#13;
&#13;
Association meeting.     I was invited to speak there.   This was&#13;
&amp;#12;                                            v. Rajagopalan, Page 13&#13;
sometime in the early 70's.        Mayor Daly    opened the&#13;
&#13;
conference.    While I was in town, a very good engineering&#13;
&#13;
company invited me to speak to their staff because they&#13;
&#13;
wanted to start a section on water supply.          I told them that&#13;
&#13;
when you go to developing countries, and design projects for&#13;
them, you need to understand that they can't import large&#13;
&#13;
quantities of sophisticated materials; so you have to try and&#13;
come up with as simple designs as possible.         There are things&#13;
&#13;
like slow sand filters which do as good a job as the modern&#13;
&#13;
facilities.     Therefore, you should not be afraid to emphasize&#13;
simple solutions.     More advanced solutions should be employed&#13;
&#13;
only when they are    ~bsolutely    necessary.   One bright guy&#13;
&#13;
immediately stood up and said, "it's fine to say all these&#13;
                      I&#13;
things, but I was never taught any of these simple things in&#13;
&#13;
my school, so why would I think of it?"          That's a big&#13;
&#13;
problem.     We need to sensitize engineers to the LDC's&#13;
&#13;
situation.     We need to encourage them to look for simpleÂ·;&#13;
&#13;
low-cost solutions to their water supply problems.&#13;
&#13;
Q:    Would you say that the earlier projects in a smaller&#13;
&#13;
bank with people more in touch with LDC needs were more&#13;
&#13;
effective, and more cost effective than projects done in the&#13;
&#13;
80s and the 90s?&#13;
A:   In the Bank's early days its main strength was in its&#13;
&#13;
technical skills, in its ability to build things well.            It&#13;
&amp;#12;                                            v. Rajagopalan, Page 14&#13;
built dams.     It built roads.     It built railways.     It built&#13;
&#13;
schools.     They were done by knowledgeable, experienced&#13;
&#13;
people.    Now, things have changed.      Populations have&#13;
increased all over the place, and the demands for services&#13;
&#13;
have increased enormously.        Expectations have increased&#13;
&#13;
enormously.     The Bank has not kept pace with all these&#13;
&#13;
increases.     Therefore, it must make some very hard choices.&#13;
&#13;
     The oil crisis had a profound effect on the Bank.           It is&#13;
in response to the oil shock the Bank started with structural&#13;
&#13;
adjustment lending {SALs).        SALs in my view, had a soporific&#13;
&#13;
effect on the institution.        Many within the Bank became&#13;
&#13;
enchanted with policy work and they started pushing it&#13;
&#13;
rigorously.     They said, "look, if policies are right, and if&#13;
                      I&#13;
we put the right policies in place, everything else will&#13;
&#13;
automatically follow."     Now, 14 years and several billion&#13;
dollars later, it is beginning to dawn on most people in the&#13;
&#13;
institution that policies are necessary for sure, but there&#13;
&#13;
are many other things that are also necessary.           We need to&#13;
have a basic physical infrastructure.        We need to have the&#13;
&#13;
human infrastructure.     Unless you have all these things,&#13;
&#13;
policies by themselves are not very helpful.        For example we&#13;
&#13;
have put various agricultural policies in place in Tanzania&#13;
&#13;
where, when they enjoy a bumper harvest, they don't have any&#13;
&#13;
roads to carry it to the market.        With all the crops rolling&#13;
&amp;#12;                                           V. Rajagopalarr, Page 15&#13;
in the field what have we accomplished?&#13;
&#13;
     I would not say we always did better projects than we&#13;
&#13;
are now doing, but OED studies have reported that the&#13;
percentage of "successful" projects has been steadily&#13;
declining.    In my view, it will decline for a few more years&#13;
&#13;
to come.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Talking about these kinds of assessments, what was your&#13;
&#13;
reaction to the Wapenhans Report?&#13;
&#13;
A:   I was involved in the drafting of the terms of reference&#13;
&#13;
for the task force.     In my view this attention to&#13;
implementation issues was long overdue, and the Wapenhans&#13;
&#13;
Report was, in a    se~se,   five years too late.   The 1987&#13;
&#13;
reorganization eliminated many of the disciplines that used&#13;
                   I                         .&#13;
to exist in the Bank before that time.  It decentralized the&#13;
&#13;
institution enormously without providing a cohesive mechanism&#13;
&#13;
which would lend a quality institutional approach to&#13;
&#13;
operations.    While it is good to have decentralized&#13;
&#13;
operations, unless you also have an institutional approach,&#13;
&#13;
there is little consistency in the way you deal with your&#13;
&#13;
clients.     The Bank serves a great number of countries and&#13;
&#13;
they all expect to be treated more or less equally.        In&#13;
&#13;
short, consistency in handling, consistency in application of&#13;
&#13;
policies and processes is particularly important for an&#13;
&#13;
international institution like ours, and that was sacrificed&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         V. Rajagopalan, Page 16&#13;
to a large extent.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   In 1987?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes, that reorganization in my view was one of the worst&#13;
things to befall on this institution since its inception.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What drove that reorganization?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Possibly the feeling that there was too much&#13;
&#13;
centralization. The Bank was becoming too large.      Clausen&#13;
&#13;
used to ask "Why do people view the Bank as a large&#13;
&#13;
institution?"   He came from Bank of America where he had&#13;
80,000 employees or something like that.    There are only&#13;
&#13;
6,000 employees at the Bank.    The Bank wasn't' large from a&#13;
&#13;
personnel standpoint, but we were trying to do too many&#13;
&#13;
things.    In most sectors we were dealing with about a hundred&#13;
                     I&#13;
borrowing countries.     The Bank's operations were quite&#13;
&#13;
complex.   We tried to do everything under the sun.    We lacked&#13;
&#13;
focus.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What forced that or what created that lack of focus?&#13;
&#13;
A:   The reorganization.    The present president is very much&#13;
aware of these issues, and when I talk to him on a one on one&#13;
&#13;
basis, he does tell me that he emphasizes selectivity.      Human&#13;
&#13;
resource development, attention to natural resources&#13;
&#13;
management, poverty alleviation, women in development,&#13;
&#13;
environmentally sustainable development and private sector&#13;
&#13;
development--these are all critical things, but then you&#13;
&amp;#12;                                           v.   Rajagopalan, Page 17&#13;
can't do everything in every country.       This is especially&#13;
&#13;
true when you have a decentralized institution without some&#13;
&#13;
sort of mechanism to introduce some consistency, some&#13;
&#13;
cohesion, and some oversight on what is going on.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      In any organization the people at the very top quite&#13;
often call the tune or shape the environment in which an&#13;
&#13;
organization operates.       In talking about this lack of focus,&#13;
&#13;
do you see that as having something to do with the kind of&#13;
&#13;
people who were at the very top?       I'm talking about the&#13;
&#13;
different presidents now.&#13;
&#13;
A:      When McNamara was there, there was a clear sense of&#13;
&#13;
direction.     There was a clear sense of leadership.      I didn't&#13;
&#13;
know him personally.      Nevertheless, as a staff member of the&#13;
                      I&#13;
institution during his presidency, I always felt that there&#13;
&#13;
was somebody giving direction to the institution.        There was&#13;
&#13;
a purpose.     There was a goal.    Everyone was working towards&#13;
&#13;
the achievement of that goal.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      What was the goal?&#13;
&#13;
A:      His Nairobi speech on poverty alleviation was a&#13;
&#13;
hallmark.     I was on the poverty task force immediately after&#13;
that.     Although we all knew that providing basic services was&#13;
&#13;
critical to development, here was a president of the World&#13;
&#13;
Bank who actually talked about it!       It gave us a sense of&#13;
&#13;
purpose, a mission, and also a vision of where the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        v. Rajagopalari, Page 18&#13;
institution was going.&#13;
&#13;
     Now, after McNamara, when Clausen became the president,&#13;
&#13;
that attitude changed.    McNamara emphasized the development&#13;
&#13;
side of the Bank's activities.    Clausen, on the other hand,&#13;
emphasized the financial side.    Fifteen years from now,&#13;
&#13;
Clausen will be remembered for putting the institution on a&#13;
solid financial base.    Clausen introduced new financial&#13;
&#13;
instruments.    If it weren't for Clausen, I don't think we&#13;
&#13;
will be doing so many co-financing and privatization&#13;
&#13;
activities today.&#13;
&#13;
     Although Clausen stressed the financial side of things,&#13;
&#13;
we still did some quality development work during his&#13;
presidency.  I was in the part of the Bank which was called&#13;
                   I&#13;
the Projects Advisory Staff and then the Projects Policy&#13;
&#13;
Department.    Without any coaxing from anybody, we wrote an&#13;
&#13;
operational manual that established the Bank's environmental&#13;
&#13;
focus.   We expanded our environmental activities and   slo~ly&#13;
&#13;
began to integrate them into Bank operations.    There was also&#13;
&#13;
a lady named Gloria Scott who did a very fine job of&#13;
&#13;
sensitizing Bank staff to the role of women in development.&#13;
&#13;
We began to do all these things on our own.     We introduced&#13;
&#13;
sociology and anthropology into this institution.    We wrote&#13;
&#13;
an operation manual statement about resettlement issues which&#13;
&#13;
the OECD countries rated very highly.    All these laid the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                       V. Raj agopalanÂ·, Page 19&#13;
foundation for today's operations. The operational complex is&#13;
&#13;
the bread and butter of this institution.&#13;
&#13;
     During the post reorganization years, in spite of the&#13;
&#13;
fact that the Bank was completely disturbed, the operational&#13;
&#13;
complex continued to push development work forward.    From the&#13;
&#13;
'87 reorganization until the '92 reorganization, I was on the&#13;
policy side.   It was one continuous turmoil, but we managed.&#13;
&#13;
We produced some world-class policy papers.   Our forest&#13;
&#13;
policy paper is considered one of the _best in the world, and&#13;
&#13;
we produced a host of others on competition policies in&#13;
&#13;
industry, urban development, housing, electric power, energy&#13;
&#13;
conservation, primary education, vocational training, and&#13;
&#13;
population &amp; family planning.&#13;
                    I&#13;
Q:   My next question deals with how these policy papers and&#13;
&#13;
studies translated into operations in light of the&#13;
&#13;
reorganization.&#13;
&#13;
A:   I must tell you a short story here.    I met with Clausen&#13;
&#13;
on his second day as Bank President. The first question he&#13;
&#13;
asked me was about the Bank's comparative advantage in&#13;
&#13;
lending for education and health.   I gave him the standard&#13;
&#13;
answer; why we exist and how we view development and so on;&#13;
&#13;
He was not at all persuaded.    In sharp contrast to this, when&#13;
&#13;
Conable became the president, {I was the vice president for&#13;
&#13;
the reorganization for sector policy and research.) he called&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         V. RajagopalanÂ·, Page 20&#13;
&#13;
me into his office and said, "Raj, I want the Bank to do more&#13;
&#13;
in education."     I said, "what do you mean?   What do you want&#13;
&#13;
me to do more in education?"     He said, "well, even before&#13;
coming to the Bank I was always interested in education and I&#13;
&#13;
want this institution to do a lot more.     It is for you to&#13;
&#13;
tell me what should be done."&#13;
&#13;
     So we wrote a paper called accelerated education&#13;
&#13;
program.     It laid the foundation for a world conference on&#13;
&#13;
education.    Furthermore, it encouraged primary education and&#13;
&#13;
basic education initiatives, and education lending took off.&#13;
&#13;
We lend now more than $2 billion annually for education.        We&#13;
&#13;
are the world's largest external provider of funds for&#13;
&#13;
education, we have so far provided more than $10 billion for&#13;
                   I&#13;
the education sector.&#13;
&#13;
     Forest policy in the world was such a contentious issue&#13;
&#13;
that in the G7 Houston Summit declaration, they called on the&#13;
&#13;
Bank to help revamp the tropical forest action program. Â·.&#13;
&#13;
Shortly thereafter, Conable asked me to get to work on this.&#13;
&#13;
My staff wrote a forest policy paper that outlined how we&#13;
&#13;
would deal with tropical forests and forests in general.        It&#13;
&#13;
was discussed with a variety of people and they accepted it.&#13;
&#13;
Today, it defines our approach to lending in forestry sector.&#13;
&#13;
Both the Bank's education and forest policy programs have&#13;
&#13;
taken off in the same way.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         V. Rajagopalan, Page 21&#13;
Q:   The restructuring, then has brought operational people&#13;
closer to the people making --&#13;
&#13;
A:   The most recent restructuring has sharply deemphasized&#13;
&#13;
policy preparation and focused on policy implementation and&#13;
&#13;
operational support.   That's what it has done.    One vice&#13;
&#13;
presidency has been broken down into three now.    The position&#13;
that I held until December of last year was split in three&#13;
&#13;
ways and three vice presidents have been appointed so that&#13;
&#13;
they can concentrate on these areas and help regions to do a&#13;
&#13;
better job of implementing these policies.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Has that brought the presidency closer to these areas?&#13;
I know that was part of the objectives for that.&#13;
&#13;
A:   It is part of the objectives. Now all the vice&#13;
                    I&#13;
presidents, report, directly to the president. The&#13;
&#13;
intermediate layer has been abolished.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   That's working pretty well?   That's working as planned?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Well, it is beginning to work.   These things take time.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I would like to turn to some of your other activities.&#13;
&#13;
Since 1991 you served as the chair of the Consultative Group&#13;
&#13;
for International Agricultural Research and you've also been&#13;
&#13;
involved with the International River Research Institute.&#13;
&#13;
How do you view the prospects for these initiatives?&#13;
&#13;
A:   CGIAR, the Consultative Group for International&#13;
&#13;
Agricultural Research, is one of the success stories in the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        V. Rajagopalari, Page 22&#13;
&#13;
world of international collaboration.     Talk to anybody in the&#13;
&#13;
world, anybody in the institution, and they will all agree it&#13;
&#13;
is one of the most successful operations and one of the best&#13;
&#13;
things that the Bank has done.    The Bank along with FAO and&#13;
UNDP, is a co-sponsor of CGIAR.    They started it some 23&#13;
&#13;
years ago.   over the past 23 years they spent their time&#13;
&#13;
primarily on conservation, enhancement, and increasing the&#13;
&#13;
productivity of basic staple outputs--wheat, rice, millet,&#13;
&#13;
sorghum, corn, potatoes, sweet potatoes, yams, cassava, beans&#13;
and forage crops.   Bananas, plantains, fisheries and forests&#13;
&#13;
have been added recently.     There are 18 international centers&#13;
&#13;
now and some 1,700 scientists work in these institutions.&#13;
&#13;
Most of them are internationally known.     They do basic&#13;
                    I&#13;
research to increase the productivity in all these areas and&#13;
&#13;
conserve, collect, and preserve the different plant genetic&#13;
&#13;
material for posterity.     We have in the CGIAR centers some&#13;
&#13;
600 1 000 samples of plant genetic material.   We hold them'in&#13;
&#13;
trust for all humanity.     Anybody in need can have the seed&#13;
&#13;
varieties and genetic material.&#13;
     In the last two years, however, CGIAR has changed its&#13;
&#13;
focus.   Now we view agricultural development from the point&#13;
&#13;
of view of the natural resource base.     We are employing&#13;
&#13;
ecoregional approaches to achieve productivity increases.&#13;
&#13;
The research over the last four or five years has shown that&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         V. Rajagopalarr, Page 23&#13;
&#13;
continuous application of fertilizers and pesticides does not&#13;
&#13;
lead, to a continuous increase in yield.     In fact, some&#13;
&#13;
decline has been noted.     This finding is worrisome because,&#13;
as populations increase, less land is available for&#13;
&#13;
agricultural development.     Therefore, we need to produce more&#13;
food on less land without degrading the resource base.       That&#13;
&#13;
is the challenge which we are now trying to address.&#13;
&#13;
     Furthermore, millions of people live in arid and semi-&#13;
&#13;
arid lands where growing anything is very difficult.       These&#13;
&#13;
populations are also growing.     How do we support this&#13;
&#13;
increasing population?    They have to eke out a living out of&#13;
&#13;
that sparse natural resource base.     How do you help them to&#13;
&#13;
produce something on those lands without degrading those&#13;
                   ;&#13;
lands? That's what we are setting out to do.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Well, I guess also obviously population control has a&#13;
&#13;
lot to do with that.&#13;
&#13;
A:   No, not for CGIAR.     This group's responsibility is to&#13;
&#13;
make sure that productivity increases are maintained.      As we&#13;
&#13;
do our research to accomplish this, the insect populations&#13;
&#13;
and the parasites we try to deal with also change&#13;
&#13;
continuously.   Research, therefore, must be a continuous&#13;
&#13;
activity.   one more thing, it takes almost 20 years before&#13;
&#13;
farmers can actually use this research.     Farmers do not want&#13;
&#13;
to take undue risks, especially poor farmers.     our work today&#13;
&amp;#12;                                          v. Rajagopalan, Page 24&#13;
will have a profound effect twenty years from now.       That is&#13;
&#13;
why research becomes critical and needs continuous support.&#13;
&#13;
        Another thing to keep in mind is that much of our&#13;
research deals with subsistence crops: beans, cassava and so&#13;
&#13;
on.     Not many in the private sector are interested in doing&#13;
&#13;
research on these as a business.      Not many governments would&#13;
&#13;
be interested in doing this, and yet there are millions and&#13;
&#13;
millions of people who are dependent on this food for their&#13;
daily requirements.       This is an important activity that CGIAR&#13;
&#13;
does.&#13;
&#13;
        As for the future, we plan to do natural resource based&#13;
&#13;
research.     This sort of research is location specific.    It&#13;
&#13;
must be done in the developing countries.      It cannot be done&#13;
                      I&#13;
in labs.     We can do plant genetic material enhancement&#13;
&#13;
research in the labs, but we cannot do plant research with&#13;
&#13;
specific soil conditions, climatic conditions and local&#13;
&#13;
variations.     If we are going to do research of that   kind~    we&#13;
&#13;
have to develop local research systems or NARS.      NARS stands&#13;
&#13;
for National Agriculture Research Systems.      We have to create&#13;
&#13;
them where they don't exist and then develop them into&#13;
&#13;
organizations which are capable of doing research.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      In your career at the Bank your responsibilities have&#13;
&#13;
placed before you some of the larger issues facing the Bank,&#13;
&#13;
particularly the broad issue of the environment.      How would&#13;
&amp;#12;                                        V. Rajagopalan, Page 25&#13;
&#13;
you assess the Bank's responsiveness to environmental issues?&#13;
A:   Our preoccupation with the environment began after the&#13;
&#13;
first Stockholm conference in 1972.    McNamara attended the&#13;
&#13;
conference and he told us that we needed to do something, and&#13;
&#13;
he appointed Dr. Jim Lee as his environment adviser.      I&#13;
&#13;
became Jim's supervisor in 1979.     During the previous seven&#13;
&#13;
years, working on the operations side, we used to think that&#13;
&#13;
Jim Lee was a bloody nuisance.     He was somebody who had to be&#13;
tolerated because the President has put him there, but he was&#13;
&#13;
not taken too seriously.   Nevertheless, since 1979, he and I&#13;
&#13;
got along quite well, and we started discussing what we could&#13;
do about the environment. We put our heads together and&#13;
&#13;
eventually expanded his staff, wrote policy pieces on&#13;
                   I&#13;
indigenous population and involuntary resettlement, and&#13;
guidelines on the use of pesticides.    These are a few&#13;
&#13;
examples of the initiatives we started taking.    We gradually&#13;
&#13;
educated the Bank staff about issues that were importantÂ·;&#13;
&#13;
     Around '85 or '86, my vice president asked me to look&#13;
&#13;
into the whole question of the economics of natural resource&#13;
&#13;
management.   Jerry Warford was my economic advisor, and I&#13;
&#13;
asked him to focus on natural resource management economics.&#13;
&#13;
So Jerry started doing work on resource accounting, that is&#13;
&#13;
on how to take care of natural resource depletion in GOP&#13;
&#13;
calculations and so on.    He did the research with consultants&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         v. Rajagopalan, Page 26&#13;
and started doing some very important basic work.&#13;
&#13;
     Meanwhile, we also explored the field of human ecology.&#13;
&#13;
We recruited an ecologist, Robert Goodland, somewhere in '83&#13;
&#13;
or '84.     We were laying the foundation slowly but steadily.&#13;
In '86 I wanted a separate department to be established and&#13;
&#13;
give environment more visibility, but then the reorganization&#13;
&#13;
came and I was told to wait.     When a separate department was&#13;
&#13;
finally established, it came under my vice presidenency.&#13;
&#13;
     My biggest disappointment in the environmental area was&#13;
that we were not able to resolve the staffing issues fast&#13;
&#13;
enough.     Although I could easily identify the absence of&#13;
&#13;
skills, I couldn't get the people I needed form the outside.&#13;
I had to make do with the personnel at hand.     In 1987, in the&#13;
                      I&#13;
environment department there were 26 positions, and all the&#13;
&#13;
26 positions were occupied by 26 bodies.     They were not&#13;
&#13;
environmental experts but they were put in the Environment&#13;
department.     Largely economists and generalists, they were&#13;
&#13;
clearly intelligent people, but they were not the experts&#13;
&#13;
that I wanted.     I wanted people who had specialized in&#13;
&#13;
sciences.     In order for me to get them, I had to recruit them&#13;
&#13;
from outside.     In order to recruit them from outside there&#13;
&#13;
were two possibilities.     One, you can give me ten more&#13;
&#13;
positions so that I can recruit ten people or you can take&#13;
&#13;
away these ten generalists and give me ten vacancies so that&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         V. Rajagopalarr, Page 27&#13;
&#13;
I can recruit.   It was moving that ten people out into the&#13;
other parts of the Bank that the institution resisted.      It&#13;
&#13;
didn't want to keep on increasing the numbers especially&#13;
&#13;
after the reorganization when we were supposed to downsize.&#13;
Nobody in the hierarchy was willing to give me additional&#13;
&#13;
positions, so it became a big problem of really moving people&#13;
&#13;
out, creating vacancies, and appointing outsiders.     That's&#13;
&#13;
the skill mix problem which this institution still faces in&#13;
&#13;
almost every sector.     We have the same problem in education.&#13;
&#13;
We have the same problem in health.     The outside world is&#13;
&#13;
constantly changing.     In order to deal with that we need to&#13;
have different skills.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   How have you dealt with that?&#13;
                    I&#13;
A:   That's a problem.     It is a very slow, tedious and&#13;
&#13;
inefficient process.     We can't simply say,"sorry, the ground&#13;
&#13;
rules have changed, the outside world has changed.&#13;
&#13;
Therefore, it is not that I don't like you or you are not&#13;
&#13;
useful anymore, but the nature of our work has changed and we&#13;
&#13;
need different skills than yours."     We are not able to say&#13;
&#13;
that because it's not a private sector operation.     We have&#13;
&#13;
rules, regulations, all kind of things, so it is very&#13;
&#13;
difficult to make changes.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Very much like the University.&#13;
&#13;
A:   It is very much like a university.     It is a problem.     In&#13;
&amp;#12;                                          V. Rajagopalan, Page 28&#13;
&#13;
fact, it's the biggest problem that we have today.       I have a&#13;
feeling that in the five years since the '87 reorganization,&#13;
&#13;
the professional strength and the technical skills of the&#13;
Bank have been eroding faster than before.      At first, there&#13;
&#13;
was a refusal to accept it, but now everybody talks about it.&#13;
&#13;
The worst thing is that it is very costly and very difficult.&#13;
That's is what we are finding out right now.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Does this create a morale problem?&#13;
&#13;
A:   Yes, it does.       It does create a morale problem. It also&#13;
creates a much larger problem because people don't want to&#13;
&#13;
reconfigure the institution.       How do institutions adjust in a&#13;
&#13;
changing world, in a world which is rapidly changing and the&#13;
&#13;
external demands on,you are rapidly changing?       How do you&#13;
                     I&#13;
adjust?&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Can you think of any one or two things that--if you&#13;
&#13;
could--that you would change right away to try and alleviate&#13;
&#13;
the situation or try and improve it?&#13;
&#13;
A:   I believe that there is room for improvement in our&#13;
&#13;
personnel system, but I also feel that External Relations&#13;
&#13;
needs help.   The needs of the institution and the messages it&#13;
&#13;
sends to the outside world are two areas which need&#13;
&#13;
attention.    As head of CGIAR and as vice president over the&#13;
&#13;
past six years, I have dealt with all the UN agencies.       I was&#13;
&#13;
the bank's main contact with FAO, UNDP, UNESCO, UNICEF, and&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         V. Rajagopalan, Page 29&#13;
&#13;
WHO at the agency level.     From that experience, I have a very&#13;
&#13;
clear feeling that we need a much more aggressive, proactive&#13;
&#13;
strategy on the external side.     We have to pay attention to&#13;
&#13;
the outside world's perception of what we are doing.&#13;
Q:      Talking about some of these environmental issues, you&#13;
&#13;
mentioned a lady earlier who had an important role in the&#13;
Bank in changing perceptions of the role of women in the&#13;
&#13;
Bank.     Could you talk a little more about her and her career&#13;
&#13;
here?&#13;
&#13;
A:      Her name is Gloria Scott and she came from the U.N. to&#13;
&#13;
work in the Bank.     She was basically responsible for bringing&#13;
in the idea of the role of women in development.     During her&#13;
&#13;
time here, she really helped to sensitize the Bank staff at&#13;
                    I&#13;
large.  Before she, came, we would go and deal with men and&#13;
&#13;
deliver extension messages about policies, farming&#13;
&#13;
techniques, etc., yet in spite of careful planning and&#13;
&#13;
project design, many of our agricultural projects failed,        It&#13;
&#13;
turned out that women worked the land and that we were&#13;
&#13;
talking to the wrong people.     In East Africa, 90% of the&#13;
&#13;
crops are produced by women, so giving important information&#13;
&#13;
to men who don't grow anything--who don't work in the fields-&#13;
&#13;
-was a waste of time.     If you want development to take place&#13;
&#13;
on the ground, you have to deal with the people who are the&#13;
&#13;
main actors, who generate development on the ground.     If we&#13;
&amp;#12;                                           v. Rajagopalan, Page 30&#13;
don't know how to deal with them and you don't deliver it to&#13;
&#13;
them, then we won't see any improvement in spite of all the&#13;
&#13;
policies, in spite of all the report writing that we do.&#13;
&#13;
Female education is the most important, critical thing to&#13;
economic development.      When the girls are educated, many&#13;
&#13;
things happen to a population.       Their nutrition improves;&#13;
&#13;
their health improves; household discipline improves; and&#13;
productivity increases.       In short, development takes place.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I'd like to talk more broadly about the whole&#13;
&#13;
relationship between the Board and the staff of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Obviously there have been very great changes in the role of&#13;
&#13;
the Board in recent years.      We would like you to talk a&#13;
&#13;
little bit about that.      Tell us about your views.&#13;
                     I&#13;
A:   In the 60s, Bank staff were not encouraged to make&#13;
&#13;
contacts with the executive directors.       Only the highest&#13;
&#13;
level people dealt with the EDs.       There was a very strict&#13;
&#13;
discipline imposed on the relationship with the Executive&#13;
&#13;
Directors in those days.       On the Board itself, as I recall,&#13;
&#13;
there were some veteran executive directors who had an&#13;
&#13;
excellent understanding of the Bank's operations, policies,&#13;
&#13;
and procedures.   When you went to the Board to present a&#13;
&#13;
project, they knew how to ask questions about the substance&#13;
&#13;
of the operations.       The Board questioned me on several&#13;
&#13;
occasions about the details of particular projects.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                         V. Rajagopalarr, Page 31&#13;
&#13;
Nevertheless, in the early days, ordinary staff members had&#13;
little contact with the Executive Directors.     All&#13;
&#13;
communication with the Board had to flow through the&#13;
hierarchy.     Secondly, the caliber, if I may use that word, of&#13;
&#13;
the Executive Directors was different.     They were much more&#13;
&#13;
knowledgeable, more experienced about the Bank's operations&#13;
&#13;
and about development in general and about the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
policies.     I, as an ordinary staff member, felt that they had&#13;
a strong sense of where we should be going and what we should&#13;
&#13;
be doing.&#13;
&#13;
     Originally, the EDs were very senior people.        Nowadays,&#13;
Executive Directors,have come from the second and third tiers&#13;
of their respective'administrations.     They aren't the topmost&#13;
                      I&#13;
people.     Very often, they come here for two or three years&#13;
&#13;
and there is a rapid turnover of the Executive Directors.        It&#13;
&#13;
takes them at least two or three years to understand the&#13;
&#13;
institution--the complexities of who is who, what are the&#13;
&#13;
interrelations and so on.     As a result, involvement with the&#13;
&#13;
operations of the Bank becomes more and more difficult, and&#13;
&#13;
their frustration increases.     This leads to much tension&#13;
&#13;
between Management and the Board.&#13;
&#13;
     Let's turn to the presidents for a moment.        When&#13;
&#13;
McNamara was here, he led us to believe that he was the&#13;
&#13;
champion of the developing world.     When the boss is a&#13;
&amp;#12;'.&#13;
&#13;
                                                v.   Rajagopalan, Page 32&#13;
     champion of the developing world, the staff all feel that&#13;
&#13;
     they are working for the developing countries, that is why&#13;
&#13;
     they are in The World Bank in the first place, and that's&#13;
     their job.&#13;
&#13;
          When Clausen became the President, he acted as the&#13;
&#13;
     Chairman of the Board of Directors and not as a champion of&#13;
&#13;
     the developing world.     When his term began, we all became&#13;
     international civil servants.       We were no longer people who&#13;
&#13;
     were in the business of helping developing countries.        We do&#13;
     our jobs, and we go home.     Clausen's tenure changed this&#13;
&#13;
     institution from a development institution with an almost&#13;
&#13;
     missionary zeal, to.an institution which is much more&#13;
&#13;
     bureaucratic.&#13;
&#13;
          Conable was a. consensus politician.       Under him, the&#13;
&#13;
     discipline in the system collapsed completely.        As a result,&#13;
&#13;
     bureaucratic rivalries took root in the institution.        Those&#13;
&#13;
     are, in my view, the most significant changes that I have&#13;
&#13;
     seen in my time here.&#13;
&#13;
          Q:      Thank you very much.    Good place to end.&#13;
&#13;

        <abstracts>
            In January 1993, Visvanathan Rajagopalan
            was interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Archives oral
            history program by William Becker and David Milobsky. During
            his tenure at the Bank from 1965 to 1994, Mr. Rajagopalan
            worked in the following areas: in the public utilities
            department as a sanitary engineer for the water supply
            division (1969-1972) and as deputy division chief (1972); in
            the Asia projects department as section chief for the public
            utilities division (1972-1973) and as division chief for the
            water supply division (1974-1975); in the South Asia
            projects department as assistant director (1975-1979) and as
            director of the project advisory staff for central projects
            (1979-1982); in the projects policy department as director
            (1982-1986); for the Europe, Middle East and North Africa
            (EMENA) region as director of the projects department
            (1986-1987); as vice president for sector policy research
            (1987-1991) and for sector and operations policy
            (1991-1992); as chairman for the Consultative Group on
            International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) (1991-1993); and
            as vice president and as special advisor in the office of
            the president (1993-1994). His transcript concerns his
            educational background, management and reorganization, the
            Wapenhans report, the role of women in the World Bank, and
            the relationship between the board and the staff at the
            World Bank.
