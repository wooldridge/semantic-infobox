RURAL POVERTY AND NATURAL RESOURCES PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Country Overview&#13;
1.1   Country and Sector Background. With a 1996 per capita income of US$2,880&#13;
and low inflation, the Panamanian economy appears to be among the most prosperous in&#13;
the region. Progress on the economic reform agenda has been good in recent years,&#13;
supported in part by the Economic Recovery Loan (Ln. 3438-PA), which disbursed its&#13;
third and final tranche in April 1997.&#13;
1.2   As a result of the progress made, prospects for growth in Panama are good. GDP&#13;
growth of 3.5% is projected for 1997 and 4% thereafter, and stable growth would support&#13;
Government's poverty alleviation efforts. In the meantime, however, Panama has one of&#13;
the most unequal distributions of income in the hemisphere, and, as described below, rural&#13;
poverty in particular has had a negative effect on the conservation of natural resources.&#13;
B. Government Policy in Agriculture and Natural Resources&#13;
1.3   Historically, inefficient public expenditure and policy distortions were prevalent in&#13;
the rural sector, especially prior to 1989. Public expenditure has had an urban bias, in&#13;
particular in favor of those activities related to international trade and the Panama Canal.&#13;
Expenditure in human capital formation has also been concentrated in the urban areas.&#13;
Where there has been expenditure to rural areas or agriculture in particular, it has been&#13;
targeted to medium and large farmers: the Agricultural Research Institute - Instituto de&#13;
Investigaci6n Agropecuaria, has emphasized research for crops and activities that medium&#13;
and large producers are able to invest in: irrigation, extensive cattle, mechanized rice, etc.,&#13;
and which have limited relevance for small mixed crop/livestock producers. Credit&#13;
subsidies have been used mainly by large farmers for livestock production and mechanized&#13;
rice.&#13;
1.4   The most negative impact of Governments past policies in the agricultural sector&#13;
and the livelihood of the rural population has come from trade protection, which in theory&#13;
was intended to improve (small) producers' incomes. Its actual effect was to increase the&#13;
cost of food, both for the urban as well as the rural populations, including subsistence&#13;
farmers who are net consumers of food. Government also protected and provided&#13;
subsidized credit for those activities in which Panama has no comparative advantage: rice,&#13;
milk, tomatoes, corn, sugar. For those where Panama does have a clear advantage&#13;
(sustainable forest extraction or plantations, and export crops like melon and root crops) it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2 -&#13;
did relatively little. The more competitive crops (bananas, coffee) were taxed, while the&#13;
least competitive (milk, rice) were subsidized.&#13;
1.5   In the natural resource sector, policies have been equally contradictory, producing&#13;
on balance, a negative effect on the environment. Government has difficulties controlling&#13;
deforestation of private or protected areas. There is little research on species selection&#13;
and marketing. In the past, the support, protection, and subsidization of the cattle&#13;
industry has been a major contributor to deforestation, in Panama as in most of Central&#13;
America.&#13;
1.6    Realizing the effect these policies have had on poverty and natural resource&#13;
degradation, the Government has since 1989 initiated changes that have reduced the role&#13;
of the state in the economy, privatized state enterprises, reduced tariff and non-tariff&#13;
barriers, increased social investment in the rural sector and reduced credit subsidies.&#13;
However, there have been many decades of neglect in the rural areas, and a longer-term&#13;
concerted effort is needed to redress the situation, with special emphasis on employment-&#13;
creating and income-generating productive activities, both on- and off-farm, and improved&#13;
management of the country's unique biological resources.&#13;
C. Rural Poverty and Natural Resources&#13;
1 7    Rural Poverty. According to the 1991 national household survey, 42 percent of&#13;
households were poor, and 23 percent were in extreme poverty (Figure 1). These&#13;
percentages understate the true situation, because the survey only includes households&#13;
whose income is known, thus excluding some of the poorest groups, such as subsistence&#13;
farmers and indigenous populations. The rural poor (two-thirds of the total), can be found&#13;
throughout the country (IBRD Map No. 28508), but they are particularly concentrated in&#13;
the more mountainous, resource-depleted parts of the country. Basic needs (education,&#13;
health and housing) met are particularly low: Veraguas 9 percent, Cocle and Colon 17&#13;
percent, and Herrera 29 percent1. A graphic representation of the disparities in urban-&#13;
rural poverty in Panama is in Figure 1; poverty is considerably more widespread and more&#13;
extreme in the rural areas.&#13;
Source "Panama: Niveles de Satisfacci6n de las Necesidades Basicas, MIPPE, 1993". The definition&#13;
of basic needs includes the provision of education, health, and housing.&#13;

1.8    Most of the rural poor who live in these areas subsist in ecologically fragile areas&#13;
with degraded natural resources, little forest cover, poor soils, and threatened water&#13;
supplies. Many have insufficient land (47 percent have less than 1 ha), they must use&#13;
poorly maintained roads for access to markets, and they have little working capital, credit,&#13;
or new agricultural technologies. Their farm incomes are supplemented by occasional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
employment, often seasonal, which is usually considerably below the legal minimum wage.&#13;
More than half of rural men (55 percent) and women (59 percent) receive incomes below&#13;
the $250 monthly minimum. Health and education services are often absent or far from&#13;
the villages. Finally, a large percentage of their limited cash income is spent on high cost&#13;
food (para 1.5) and related to this, malnutrition is prevalent.&#13;
1.9    Women are usually the most affected by poverty, suffering from additional work,&#13;
poor nutrition, health (life expectancy is five years less than men's) and education services,&#13;
low wages and even less access than poor man to credit, land markets and technology.&#13;
Indigenous populations are the poorest of the poor (para. 2.18), and receive little&#13;
governmental assistance, although this is now changing somewhat. Recent experiences&#13;
(para 1.15 and 1.16) with both the rural poor mentioned above and the indigenous groups&#13;
show the considerable potential which exists for improving living standards through&#13;
productive activities if appropriate participatory, demand-driven assistance is provided to&#13;
the communities.&#13;
1.10  Natural Resources. The Isthmus of Panama is the terrestrial bridge which unites&#13;
the continental masses of North and South America and separates the waters of the Pacific&#13;
and Atlantic Oceans. This and a number of other biogeographic and climatic factors&#13;
combine to make Panama a high biodiversity country with 12 confirmed life zones out of&#13;
30 globally. Its narrow mass between two oceans and sharp altitudinal gradients (sea-level&#13;
to 3,400m) cause a compression of life zones and rapid changes within and between&#13;
habitat-types. The former Canal Zone transects such a gradient and represents the only&#13;
location in the Americas where an interoceanic biological corridor is still practically&#13;
uninterrupted, protecting the water supply of a $400 million per year operation (shipping&#13;
fees and services related to the Canal) of global economic importance.&#13;
1.11  In addition, a large portion of the Atlantic watershed constitutes relatively pristine&#13;
ecosystems, forming a defacto biological corridor from Colombia to Costa Rica (IBRD&#13;
Map No. 28336), making it a very important part of the Mesoamerican Biological&#13;
Corridor. The forests of the Darien (IBRD Map No. 28339), which are also part of the&#13;
corridor, act as a biological barrier to the interchange of economically important crop and&#13;
livestock diseases and pests (e.g., foot and mouth disease) between South, Central, and&#13;
North America. From a conservation perspective, a recent World Bank study2 has&#13;
identified Panama as the one country in the Central American Isthmus with areas of&#13;
globally important Tropical Moist Broadleaf Forest (Choc6/Darien moist forests). Also of&#13;
note from this study, two-thirds of Panama falls either into the "highest" or "high" priority&#13;
category for biodiversity conservation.&#13;
1.12  The existence of such rich biodiversity contrasts sharply with the land use&#13;
situation. Over half the forests have disappeared mostly in the Pacific, leaving about 43&#13;
percent (33 million ha) forested mostly in the Atlantic. Another 25 percent of all lands are&#13;
considered either as degraded or in the process of rapid degradation, and as in other&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
countries, this process is often tied to rural poverty, highly prevalent in Panama (para 1.8).&#13;
The lack of opportunities in the degraded areas (primarily the mountainous Central Pacific&#13;
provinces of Veraguas, Chiriqui, Colon, Cocle, Herrera) has forced thousands of small&#13;
farmers to migrate to resource-rich areas (provinces of Bocas del Toro and Darien), where&#13;
they receive a higher return to their labor by deforesting, cultivating the land for a few&#13;
years, and then, often selling the land to extensive livestock operations. Their&#13;
deforestation is usually preceded by loggers who extract the most valuable timber species.&#13;
Overall deforestation, including timber extraction and other activities, is estimated at an&#13;
annual rate of 55,000 ha. These migration patterns are graphically represented below.&#13;

1.13   To protect what remains of the country's healthy ecosystems, the government has&#13;
set aside 23 percent of its territory to form the National Protected Area System (NAPAS -&#13;
IBRD Map No. 28337), made up of 46 management units, and with representation of&#13;
most of the 12 confirmed life zones. However, the generous size of the system has not&#13;
been adequately supported. Field personnel are under-equipped, boundaries have not&#13;
been clearly established, and there are only a few parks which have the most rudimentary&#13;
facilities to receive visitors or scientists. Strategic planning, staff training and alternative&#13;
financing strategies are often lacking or inadequate. The result of this is that the NAPAS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
is experiencing invasions and deforestation and some "forest reserves" are now down to&#13;
only 20 percent forest cover.&#13;
D. Institutional Framework&#13;
1.14   Community Organizations. While there have been efforts to organize rural&#13;
communities in the past, most have had little lasting effect in the communities. These&#13;
efforts have involved land reform organizations, cooperatives, community-wide groups,&#13;
sectoral community groups related to religion, politics, health, education, and agricultural&#13;
production. Some of the reasons for the failure or non-sustainability of many of these&#13;
groups are: high poverty rates, paternalistic approaches to development and limited or no&#13;
efforts to strengthen community development in leadership, organization, and project&#13;
cycle methods. Despite this generally weak environment for community organization,&#13;
several rural organizations have survived and prospered, including organizations for&#13;
marketing and savings and loan. Some recent experiences have also shown that&#13;
participatory approaches have yielded significant returns in terms of reaching goals and&#13;
maintaining longer-term sustainability. Municipalities3 are quite weak, and generally&#13;
ineffective in promoting development in their constituency area. There are several&#13;
programs aimed at strengthening them, such as the Local Investments Programs and XXI&#13;
Century, executed by the Planning Ministry (MIPPE). The Social Emergency Fund (FES)&#13;
is also a successful example of a demand-driven, participatory mechanism to finance&#13;
4&#13;
mainly social infrastructure4.&#13;
1.15   Local Private Organizations. There are a number of private organizations in the&#13;
high rural poverty areas of the Central Pacific, in the Provinces of Herrera, Veraguas and&#13;
Los Santos, including non-governmental organizations (NGO), cooperatives and producer&#13;
organizations. Some of the more active NGOs include FundeProve (Desarrollo de la&#13;
Provincia de Veraguas), PRODESO (Promoci6n del Desarrollo Social), and Fundamujer.&#13;
About 20 cooperatives also operate in these areas, including two of the most important in&#13;
the country: Juan XXIII, and COOPEVE (Cooperativa del Educador Veraguense).&#13;
Other cooperatives relate to milk producers, livestock production, agricultural marketing,&#13;
savings and loans, and a union of agricultural exports cooperatives (UCA.PE). There are&#13;
also several agricultural organizations, including ADEMIP (Asociaci6n para el Desarrollo&#13;
del Micro y Pequefio Productor) for small and medium producers, and an organization of&#13;
3 The administrative division of the country is province (9), district (68), which is the municipal level,&#13;
and corregimiento (510), the representatives of which form, with the elected mayor, the municipal&#13;
council. As in other Latin American countries, the municipality covers a geographic demarcation that&#13;
includes urban and rural areas.&#13;
4 The FES, established in 1990, was formerly financed by USAID, and now is supported by the Inter-&#13;
American Development Bank, and IFAD. The World Bank is now preparing a project to support it for&#13;
an additional period. FES channels matching grants to finance investments in the whole country. It is&#13;
an autonomous public entity, independent from the cumbersome regulations on procurement,&#13;
disbursement, and financial management of other governmental institutions. It is directly managed by&#13;
the President's office. As is normally the case with such funds elsewhere in the Latin American&#13;
region, most investment is destined to social infrastructure and a small proportion of its resources&#13;
destined to productive subprojects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
small and micro-entrepreneurs. Several of these have worked on a small scale with donors&#13;
on rural credit, community organization, identification and implementation of community&#13;
projects, agro-industries and agricultural technology. As mentioned above, participatory,&#13;
demand-driven approaches to rural development have been the most successful, although&#13;
many of the smaller organizations require strengthening through training and the adequate&#13;
provision of equipment to improve their effectiveness in the field.&#13;
1.16 Ministry of Agricultural Development (MIDA). MIDA has the greatest&#13;
government presence in rural areas. However, despite its coverage, it is spread thinly; it is&#13;
estimated that MIDA provides technical assistance to less than 5 percent of farmers,&#13;
mostly medium and large commercial farmers, and the Agricultural Research Institute&#13;
(IDIAP) has almost exclusively emphasized developing technologies for commercial&#13;
agriculture in the past. MIDA's structure is made up of provincial directorates with&#13;
considerable decision-making delegation, and it utilizes agricultural extension offices in&#13;
each district which, typically, are made up of up to seven or eight agricultural and social&#13;
science professionals. MIDA can legally constitute farmners' organizations called&#13;
Agricultural Committees and Rural Women's Groups. Generally speaking, field staff are&#13;
inadequately trained, especially for dealing with small farmers, and underequipped for&#13;
transport, rural communications or field demonstrations. MIDA has begun to work with&#13;
NGOs in an effort to increase its coverage and effectiveness, in particular for small farmers&#13;
which it has paid relatively little attention to in the past. Its newly created Department of&#13;
Rural Development supervises various new small farmer projects (para 1.22), showing its&#13;
efforts to reach the small farmer and improve its project management capacity. Other&#13;
sectoral institutions include the Agricultural Marketing Institute, the Community&#13;
Development Institute, and the Panamanian Cooperative Institution.&#13;
1.17  Institutefor Renewable Natural Resource (INRENARE). Charged with the&#13;
conservation and management of renewable natural resources, INRENARE has focused&#13;
most of its efforts on the formation and management of the National Protected Areas&#13;
System (para 1. 14), though it also has reforestation and forest management programs, and&#13;
regulation and control of natural resource use. Considering its responsibilities,&#13;
INRENARE is inadequately staffed, trained, managed and equipped, and only recently has&#13;
the possibility of moving towards financial self-sufficiency been studied, e.g., charging&#13;
entrance fees for tourists and scientists, carbon sequestration agreements, etc. Panama is a&#13;
signatory of most international conventions, including the Biological Diversity&#13;
Convention, International Wetlands Convention-RAMSAR, Convention on International&#13;
Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), and the Central American Alliance for Sustainable&#13;
Development, among whose projects are the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor running&#13;
from southern Mexico through Northern Colombia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

E. Government Strategy for Rural Poverty Alleviation and Natural Resource&#13;
Management&#13;
1.18  Government's strategy for alleviating poverty and inequality has four main&#13;
elements: (a) introducing the conditions for sustainable growth, in particular policy&#13;
reforms that mitigate the bias against employment creation, reduce the high cost of the&#13;
basic consumption basket, and alter the incentive framework to encourage increased&#13;
agricultural production and employment in rural areas, where most poor people live; (b)&#13;
introducing more effective mechanisms to protect people most susceptible to malnutrition&#13;
and disease; (c) improving efficiency and equity in social expenditures through social&#13;
sector reforms, especially in education and health, and targeting subsidies to the most&#13;
vulnerable groups; and (d) institutional modernization in those institutions most directly&#13;
linked to poverty.&#13;
1.19  Government's strategy in the natural resources sector emphasizes the&#13;
fulfillment of the obligations set out in the law establishing INRENARE. With a vast&#13;
mandate for the conservation and management of renewable resources, including direct&#13;
control of 23 percent of the national territory, INRENARE's immediate priorities are&#13;
strengthening its staff, introducing improved management methods, and equipping its field&#13;
operations. Although some areas that are important for biodiversity protection remain&#13;
outside the NAPAS, the priority at this point is to consolidate the management of lands&#13;
already in the system. This includes better establishing the legal boundaries of protected&#13;
areas, avoiding the expansion of settlements already inside the protected areas, and&#13;
establishing protected area management committees with surrounding communities in the&#13;
buffer zones to integrate them in day-to-day operations, so these communities will be&#13;
more likely to conserve the protected resources. Promoting the longer term financial&#13;
viability of the NAPAS is another important objective of INRENARE, and Government,&#13;
with INRENARE's oversight, has embarked on a reforestation program.&#13;
program.&#13;
F. Bank Involvement in the Sector&#13;
1.20  The Bank has been relatively inactive in the agricultural sector of Panama for many&#13;
years. The most recent investment loans, which were for livestock and fisheries, were&#13;
approved in 1977. Since then, there have been two significant non-lending interventions:&#13;
First, since 1980, the Bank has been the executing agency for a United Nations&#13;
Development Programme (UNDP) project called the Regional Unit for Technical&#13;
Assistance in Agriculture in Central America (RUTA), co-financed by the Central&#13;
American Governments and other donors including the International Fund for Agricultural&#13;
Development (IFAD), the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the Food and&#13;
Agriculture Organization, and the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture&#13;
(IICA). RUTA is now in its third phase and provides technical assistance and other&#13;
support to Central American Ministries of Agriculture and other agencies. Second, in&#13;
1995 the Bank approved an Institutional Development Fund grant (No. 28877) for a&#13;
program to MIDA's Sectoral Planning and Programming Department, which is being&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
implemented with RUTA support. Two thirds of the program has been implemented and&#13;
it has been successful in strengthening a previously weak Department, by providing basic&#13;
training and equipping of its staff. The Department's analytical focus, which now includes&#13;
the small farmer, was conspicuously absent from MIDA's outlook and field efforts in the&#13;
past. The Bank has also supported reforms of the agricultural sector at the macro level&#13;
through the Economic Recovery Loan (No. 3438-PA, approved January 30, 1992), which&#13;
has supported Government in the removal of various distortions, particularly related to&#13;
trade (high protectionism) and price policies. The third and final tranche release was&#13;
approved for disbursement in March 1997.&#13;
G. Actions by Other Donors in the Sector&#13;
1.21  Although MIDA in the past has centered its attention on commercial farmers, the&#13;
current Administration has supported programs small farmers in an effort to alleviate&#13;
poverty (para. 1.19). These include various smaller pilot operations utilizing budgetary&#13;
resources and funds from the World Food Program and the European Union and are&#13;
aimed at promoting sustainable agriculture, increasing productivity, increasing access to&#13;
rural credit and developing community organizations. IFAD is implementing two projects&#13;
in high poverty and indigenous areas (Ngobe-Bugle and the Darien) and is preparing a&#13;
third project in the poorer central provinces. The Inter-American Development Bank is&#13;
financing a Modernization of Agriculture Services Project, aimed at increasing the&#13;
competitiveness of commercial farmers. Other projects are mentioned in para. 1.15.&#13;
1.22  INRENARE is currently implementing 23 projects, most of which are relatively&#13;
small (except for a larger project financed by the United States Government, they total&#13;
US$15.0 million). They include sustainable development in frontier agricultural areas&#13;
(European Union); training (Government of Japan); agro-forestry (Government of&#13;
Germany), strengthening the protected areas system (U.S. in association with ANCON, a&#13;
local NGO) and protected area and buffer zone management in the Darien (Global&#13;
Environment Facility, GEF).&#13;
H. Lessons Learned&#13;
1.23  Beneficiary Participation. There is considerable experience worldwide, some&#13;
supported by the Bank, on demand-driven development. A recent Latin American review&#13;
shows that: (i) participation by communities in project identification and preparation helps&#13;
meet community needs more closely than if investments are decided centrally; (ii) once the&#13;
communities develop a sense of ownership in a project, they are willing to co-invest in it&#13;
and support its maintenance; and (iii) if allowed responsibility for project implementation,&#13;
communities will better ensure that contractors execute the project honestly and according&#13;
to established standards. Some small-scale programs in Panama have adopted these&#13;
participatory methods with considerable success (paras. I . 14 and 1. 15).&#13;
1.24  Rural Decentralization. The proposed project would support the strengthening of&#13;
rural communities, typically at the village level. Other countries have chosen, in similar&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
projects, to work directly with the municipalities, which cover a district that can include&#13;
hundreds of communities. The Panamanian Government, which has other municipality&#13;
strengthening projects (para 1.14), has decided in this project to work directly with the&#13;
local communities as a step toward overcoming a strong paternalistic legacy and toward&#13;
grass-root decentralization. Community organization and self-management are among the&#13;
project's prime objectives, as experience has shown them to improve the targeting of the&#13;
poor, to provide more local control and to increase development focus and accountability.&#13;
1.25  Biodiversity Protection. Recent Bank experience in this area has grown&#13;
considerably in the last five years with 27 Bank supported and 31 GEF supported projects&#13;
worldwide, totaling US$531 million. An independent review of the UNDP and Bank&#13;
affiliated projects financed by the GEF showed that more emphasis needs to be given to&#13;
avoid: (i) insufficient attention to local people and their expertise and priorities; and&#13;
(ii) inadequate NGO involvement. A recent Bank review5 of its projects in the sector&#13;
concluded that: (i) conservation incentives must be substantive and realistic; (ii) buffer-&#13;
zone activities and areas must be clearly prioritized with related rural development&#13;
activities for neighboring communities. A UNDP executed GEF project, Biodiversity in&#13;
the Darien, started in January 1995, takes into account several of these lessons:&#13;
substantive buffer zone community involvement in the implementation, and providing&#13;
greater economic incentives for project beneficiaries.&#13;

Conservation on Biological Diversity".&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

H. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Origin&#13;
2.1   In 1994, the Bank agreed to a Panamanian Government request for assistance in&#13;
preparing a project dealing with natural resource conservation and management. Project&#13;
preparation was financed by a grant from the Japanese Government and a Project&#13;
Preparation Facility (PPF). Project preparation was carried out by a small unit that&#13;
operated under the directives of a MIDA, INRENARE, and MIPPE steering committee,&#13;
with the assistance from the Regional Unit for Technical Assistance in Agriculture in&#13;
Central America (RUTA).&#13;
2.2   Although the project originated as a natural resources project, its scope was&#13;
expanded during project preparation, given the realization that a great deal of natural&#13;
resource degradation is linked to rural poverty. Experience in Panama and elsewhere had&#13;
shown that fencing off forested/protected areas does not stop invasions and deforestation;&#13;
the root causes of these have to be dealt with, including rural poverty. Neither rural&#13;
poverty programs nor natural resources management have been given sufficient attention&#13;
by Government in the past, but the present Administration has made several efforts to&#13;
reverse this situation. In the rural areas this has meant increased expenditure, mainly in&#13;
the social sectors. Few investments have been made in productive activities, however,&#13;
which are essential to increasing employment and income.&#13;
2.3   During project preparation, two issues came up which particularly influenced&#13;
project design. The first was whether the two major components, dealing with rural&#13;
poverty and natural resources, respectively, should be separated into two projects. It was&#13;
ultimately determined with Government that the arguments were stronger for keeping&#13;
them together to deal with the root causes of rural poverty, which in turn could alleviate&#13;
pressure on natural resources. In addition, it was decided that maintaining both&#13;
components in a single project would promote the coordination between public and&#13;
private institutions that work in both sectors, thereby reinforcing the links between the&#13;
two. Second (and perhaps somewhat contradictory to the first issue), in view of the fact&#13;
that this would be the first Bank financed operation in the rural productive sector in many&#13;
years, there were suggestions made during project preparation to consider including other&#13;
rural development areas that require support, such as national research and extension&#13;
programs, the rural financial sector, and the national land administration system. It was&#13;
ultimately decided that this project should maintain its focus on a few priority areas,&#13;
although during implementation of the project new areas could be identified that future&#13;
Bank-supported lending and non-lending services could address.&#13;
B. Project Objectives and Summary Description&#13;
2.4   The principal objectives of the project are to: (i) apply, on a pilot basis,&#13;
methodologies that would channel financial resources to rural communities to assist them&#13;
in promoting sustainable productive systems, and thereby reduce rural poverty, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
degradation of natural resources and migration; and (ii) promote the sustainable use and&#13;
conservation of selected priority biodiversity areas. Special emphasis would be placed on&#13;
gender and indigenous aspects. More specifically, operational goals include:&#13;
(a) Creating capacity at the local community level to organize, self-diagnose&#13;
problems, plan activities through participatory means, seek out and negotiate assistance,&#13;
and act in pursuit of resolving priority quality of life issues.&#13;
(b) Establishing a demand-driven financing mechanism that operates in high&#13;
poverty areas and provides matching grants to communities for activities that help reduce&#13;
rural poverty, improve the quality of life, and offer alternatives for sustainable natural&#13;
resource management and livelihood.&#13;
(c) Promoting the long-term conservation and sustainable use of Panama's&#13;
biodiversity resources, including the biological corridor that passes through the Atlantic&#13;
watershed.&#13;
2.5    To meet these objectives, the project would finance three closely related&#13;
components:&#13;
(a) Sustainable Rural Development. Implemented by the Ministry of&#13;
Agricultural Development (MIDA), NGOs, and private and community&#13;
organizations, this component would promote community training,&#13;
organization, planning and investment. The project would: (i) provide training&#13;
and organizational assistance to communities to identify their needs, in&#13;
activities related to production technology, production support, community&#13;
organization and rural development, and to prepare community development or&#13;
action plans using participatory methodologies; and (ii) establish a demand-&#13;
driven Fund for Sustainable Agricultural and Rural Development (FUSARD)&#13;
that would provide matching grants to communities to help finance these plans&#13;
in whole or in part (other sources of funds would also be used when available).&#13;
Eligible investments would include: agricultural system research, agricultural&#13;
extension, technical assistance, training and productive infrastructure, including&#13;
mini-irrigation schemes, processing facilities, reforestation and rehabilitation of&#13;
rural roads.&#13;
(b) Biodiversity Conservation.6 Implemented by the Institute for Renewable&#13;
Natural Resources (INRENARE) and NGOs, this component would support&#13;
6 Although conceptually and administratively part of the same project, the GEF grant (for the Atlantic&#13;
Biological Corridor) would be managed as a separate financial operation, with different timing,&#13;
documentation, legal agreements and supervision reports. The GEF activities are still under&#13;
preparation, and expected to be submitted for Board approval in FY98, and if approved,&#13;
implementation would start about four months after the IBRD loan is effective. The description&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
activities in selected areas in the Pacific Zone and the Atlantic Biological&#13;
Corridor. The component would finance (i) biodiversity research and planning,&#13;
including base studies, management plans, and environmental impact&#13;
assessment and monitoring; (ii) capacity building for relevant actors in&#13;
biodiversity conservation and sustainable use, including modernization of&#13;
protected areas management and institutional strengthening in environmental&#13;
impact assessment processes; and (iii) activities that contribute to biodiversity&#13;
conservation and sustainable use, including protected areas delimitation and&#13;
infrastructure, and environmental subprojects.&#13;
(c) Project Coordination. The above two components would be coordinated by&#13;
a Project Coordinating Unit (PCU), formed mostly by seconded staff from the&#13;
two lead institutions, MIDA, and INRENARE. Through this component, the&#13;
project would also finance technical assistance and studies agreed with the&#13;
Bank for these and other areas related to rural development and natural&#13;
resources management.&#13;
C. Rationale for Bank and GEF Involvement&#13;
2.6    Consistency with the CAS. The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for&#13;
Panama (Report No. 13846-PAN), dated December 28, 1994, and discussed at the Board&#13;
on February 7, 1995, focuses on: (i) reviving sustainable growth; and (ii) poverty&#13;
alleviation. This strategy is consistent with the overall thrust of the donor program in&#13;
Panama, which emphasizes medium-term fiscal viability, sustainable growth, poverty&#13;
reduction, and environmental conservation. The proposed project is consistent with these&#13;
objectives and is included in the CAS. It would foster sustainable growth in rural areas,&#13;
thereby stabilizing populations that may otherwise migrate to frontier areas and to cities&#13;
(Figure 1). The Biodiversity Conservation Component would improve natural resource&#13;
use and conservation and help increase the economic potential of these areas for future&#13;
generations, and the Sustainable Rural Development Component would focus resources&#13;
on poverty alleviation.&#13;
2.7    Consistency with GEF Strategies. The proposed GEF supported activities are&#13;
consistent with the guidance from the First and Second Conferences of the Parties (COP I&#13;
and COP2). The project would: address in situ conservation; include institutiona)&#13;
capacity building; strengthen conservation management, and promote suitable use of&#13;
ecosystems and habitats, including coastal and marine ecosystems and mountain regions"&#13;
and strengthen the involvement of local and indigenous peoples and integrate social&#13;
dimensions, including those related to poverty. The proposed GEF supported activities&#13;
are also part of a larger GEF-supported strategy for an integrated Mesoamerican&#13;
Biological Corridor within GEF operational program #3 for forest ecosystems. Other&#13;
presented of GEF financed activities is preliminary and could be changed during the on-going&#13;
preparation of the component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
related projects are currently under preparation with Bank and GEF support in Honduras&#13;
and Nicaragua.&#13;
2.8   Complementarity with other Bank Operations. The project would complement&#13;
two on-going IBRD operations that support poverty alleviation: the Basic Education&#13;
Project (Loan No. 3994, approved March 3, 1996), the Nutrition and Health Project&#13;
(Loan No. 3841, approved 7 February, 1995) and the proposed Social Investment Fund&#13;
Project (Fondo de Emergencia Social, or FES, scheduled for Board presentation later in&#13;
1997).. The project would be especially complementary to the FES Project as part of a&#13;
rural poverty alleviation strategy. Based on experience elsewhere in Latin America&#13;
(Chapter 1), when Community Action Plans (CAPs) are prepared, they are likely to&#13;
contain a combination of productive and social needs. The Rural Poverty and Natural&#13;
Resources Project would support the preparation of CAPs including subprojects to&#13;
address both needs: the social subprojects would then be submitted to the FES and other&#13;
financing sources when available, and the productive subprojects would be submitted to&#13;
the FUSARD (for rural roads, see para. 2.11 (b)). Besides this linkage to the proposed&#13;
FES Project, project preparation has coincided with and has been linked to the Bank-&#13;
supported Living Standards Measurement Survey; many of the results of the study will be&#13;
used as part of the project's baseline survey.&#13;
2.9 Complementarity Between the Bank and GEF Financed Activities. The&#13;
proposed project has been developed to provide the Government of Panama with a&#13;
coherent, multi-sectoral response to the interrelated issues of rural poverty, natural&#13;
resources management, and biodiversity conservation. The Bank financed activities would&#13;
contribute to the specific objectives of the GEF financed activities by: (i) channeling rural&#13;
development investments and agricultural intensification to the poor mountainous regions&#13;
of the Central Pacific provinces, thereby reducing the causes leading to out-migration and&#13;
expansion of the agricultural frontier caused by farmers squatting in protected areas;&#13;
(ii) contributing to strengthening of the protected areas system and INRENARE' s&#13;
institutional capacity for conservation and management. At the same time the GEF&#13;
financed activities would complement the Bank financed activities by: (i) identifying&#13;
priority areas for conservation and sustainable use within the Mesoamerican Biological&#13;
Corridor to guide public spending; (ii) establishing sustainable mechanisms for biodiversity&#13;
protection, and the financial viability of the protected areas; (iii) supporting local&#13;
subprojects related to global biodiversity benefits, and (iv) training indigenous and non-&#13;
indigenous communities in methodologies and technologies consistent with the overall&#13;
objective of biodiversity conservation and natural resources management.&#13;
D. Program Objective Categories&#13;
2.10  Most project activities and benefits are related to the productive activities of the&#13;
rural poor and the sustainable use of the natural resource base. Approximately 70% of&#13;
project communities are below the poverty line. Therefore, the project is included in the&#13;
Program of Targeted Interventions and designated as belonging to the Program Objective&#13;
Categories of: (a) Poverty Alleviation and (b) Environmentally Sustainable Development.&#13;

E. Detailed Project Description&#13;
(1)    Sustainable Rural Development Component (US$23.6 million, 60.6 percent of&#13;
total cost)&#13;
2.11   This component would be implemented under MIDA's responsibility through two&#13;
sequenced actions: (a) training and equipping of public and private organizations, which&#13;
would in turn train and organize communities in the project area to diagnose their&#13;
development needs and prepare Community Action Plans (CAPs); and (b) implementing&#13;
the CAPs through community investments financed by MIDA through the proposed Fund&#13;
for Sustainable Agricultural and Rural Development (FUSARD). These actions are&#13;
summarized below and detailed in Annex A.&#13;
(a)   Institutional and community training, organization, and planning&#13;
(US$7.9 million). The project would finance training, technical assistance,&#13;
equipment and vehicles for MIDA, NGOs and rural communities. These&#13;
funds would be used for three activities: (i) training and rural&#13;
organization (US$3.2 million), which consists of (a) strengthening&#13;
MIDA's Department of Rural Development to be better prepared for its&#13;
supervisory and normative role in the implementation of this and other rural&#13;
development projects as it only recently has commenced dealing with small,&#13;
poor producers; (b) retraining and equipping of MIDA and NGO and other&#13;
Implementing Organization staff to carry out project activities; (c) training&#13;
and organizing communities, particularly in the area of participatory&#13;
community diagnostics and planning, the end result of which would be the&#13;
development of Community Action Plans'; (ii) technical assistance to&#13;
rural communities in production technology development (US$3.0&#13;
million); and (iii) production support (US$1.6 million) to prepare&#13;
subprojects identified in the CAPs to be presented to the FUSARD for&#13;
financing. In some cases sub-projects would be grouped together and&#13;
rationalized where appropriate in a Provincial Action Plan for such&#13;
subprojects as rural roads rehabilitation, reforestation schemes, nurseries,&#13;
soil conservation schemes, agro-industries, etc. The technical assistance&#13;
for subproject preparation would be procured from existing institutions as&#13;
needed (e.g., mini-irrigation, small scale agro-industries and marketing). In&#13;
certain technical areas, however, (e.g., smallholder technology) adequate&#13;
technical assistance is not available from existing institutions, and special&#13;
programs may have to be organized by the project to meet these needs.&#13;
These are described in paras 3.7 and 3.8, and the training program is&#13;
described in Document 5 in Annex H.&#13;
A Community Action Plan is a list of investment needs (subprojects) ranked according to a defined&#13;
development strategy, resources availability, and implementation possibilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
(b)   Rural Subprojects through the Fund for Sustainable Agricultural and&#13;
Rural Development (FUSARD) (US$15.7 million). This demand-driven&#13;
fund, to be created within MIDA under the project, would finance-on a&#13;
matching grant basis- productive community investment activities (called&#13;
rural subprojects) developed in the CAPs. The beneficiary communities&#13;
would contribute a variable share-ranging from 10 to 30 percent- of the&#13;
cost of the subproject in kind and/or cash. The CAPs of one province&#13;
would be submitted to the Provincial Technical Committee (PTC) and&#13;
would be grouped where appropriate in the Provincial Action Plan. Some&#13;
subprojects, such as social infrastructure, would be submitted to the Social&#13;
Emergency Fund (FES), or other similar programs for financing. Other&#13;
subprojects, such as productive agriculture and related investments, would&#13;
be submitted to FUSARD. FES has gained considerable experience&#13;
rehabilitating rural roads. Thus, in the project area, FUSARD would&#13;
finance the rehabilitation of rural roads through the FES, who would&#13;
actually contract and supervise the works. While in most cases the&#13;
technical assistance for subproject preparation would be provided under the&#13;
institutional and community training subcomponent, for larger and/or more&#13;
complex feasibility studies, such as certain community irrigation schemes or&#13;
small-scale agro-industries, the study itself could be considered a&#13;
"subproject" for financing from FUSARD.&#13;
(2)   Biodiversity Conservation Component (total cost US$11.6 million, 29.8&#13;
percent of total cost; GEF US$8.1 million).&#13;
2.12  This component includes: (a) studies to prepare management plans for selected&#13;
priority biodiversity areas; related environmental impact assessments; and a public&#13;
information campaign with respect to these areas; (b) the design and implementation of&#13;
plans to promote the participation of the population living in these areas; (c) the provision&#13;
of training and technical assistance to INRENARE, beneficiaries and others in&#13;
environmental matters, subprojects to promote the sustainable use and conservation of&#13;
project areas to identify and monitor biodiversity threats to these areas. For the purposes&#13;
of implementation, this component would be divided into two subcomponents: (a) Pacific&#13;
Zone Protected Area Management and (b) Panama Atlantic Biological Corridor. The&#13;
Bank and GOP would finance INRENARE strengthening and the investments in the&#13;
protected areas outside the Panamanian portion of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor&#13;
on the Atlantic side of the country, which total US$2.2 million. Investments in the&#13;
Atlantic Biological Corridor are still under preparation, and financing for these, totaling&#13;
US$8.1 million, is being requested from the Global Environmental Facility (see footnote,&#13;
para 2.05).&#13;
(a)   The Pacific Zone Protected Area Management Subcomponent (total&#13;
cost US$0.9 million; GEF: no contribution) would finance civil works,&#13;
equipment, consultant services, training, workshops, community&#13;
subprojects and operation and maintenance costs. Activities would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
include: (i) improved management of priority protected areas of national&#13;
importance in the Pacific Zone including Cerro Hoya National Park and the&#13;
Islas de Canias, Isla Iguana and Isla Taboga Wildlife Refuges through&#13;
investment in infrastructure (administrative/research/visitors centers), PA&#13;
perimeter land titling, equipment for administration and management&#13;
(radios, fire fighting, boats, office), (ii) training of protected area system's&#13;
personnel; (iii) management planning and implementation; (iv) community&#13;
outreach and environmental education; and (v) development of the PA's&#13;
ecotourism potential with involvement of local communities.&#13;
(b)   The Atlantic Biological Corridor Subcomponent (total cost US$10.8;&#13;
GEF US$7.9) is still under preparation (footnote, para 2.5). This&#13;
subcomponent would include: (i) Atlantic Biological Corridor (ABC)&#13;
Information and Planning includes: (a) supporting studies to integrate&#13;
the corridor into sectoral development planning and policies;&#13;
(b) elaboration and dissemination of corridor land use plans with and&#13;
among local stakeholders (at both the municipal and community levels);&#13;
(c) biodiversity monitoring to identify, monitor, and address threats to the&#13;
corridor and biodiversity; and (d) promotion, information dissemination&#13;
and awareness building, nationally and among communities in the region on&#13;
the ABC and biodiversity. (ii) Capacity Building For Biodiversity&#13;
Conservation and Sustainable Use for: (a) strengthening indigenous and&#13;
non-indigenous communities' capacity to monitor resource use and to&#13;
conserve and sustainably use biodiversity resources; (b) creating and&#13;
strengthening partnership mechanisms involving private sector, NGOs and&#13;
local governments/communities to enhance protection of priority areas,&#13;
land use planning and better land use practices; (c) upgrading management&#13;
norms on public lands in support of biodiversity conservation; and iv)&#13;
development of a revenue capture and financial management systems for&#13;
protected areas. (iii) Atlantic Biological Corridor (ABC) Investment&#13;
Program includes: (a) assisting indigenous communities in critical areas of&#13;
the corridor to regularize their access and usufruct of lands; (b) a grant&#13;
program for local biodiversity conservation and management activities,&#13;
targeted at incremental needs for conservation and protection of priority&#13;
areas in the corridor; and (c) strengthening management in priority&#13;
protected areas within the corridor in cooperation with local stakeholders.&#13;
(3)   Project Coordination Component (total cost US$3.7 million, 9.6 percent of&#13;
total; GEF US$0.2 million)&#13;
2.13   A Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) would be set up to coordinate the&#13;
implementation of the two components. Most staff would be seconded from MIDA and&#13;
INRENARE, but approximately seven professionals would be hired where appropriate&#13;
skills are not available in the two institutions. The PCU would be provided with office&#13;
space, vehicles, equipment, funds for project management and related technical assistance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
and services (e.g., audits, monitoring and evaluation, legal, policy and other studies), funds&#13;
for other operating costs, and funds for selected priority studies related to rural&#13;
development and natural resources management, including for the preparation of future&#13;
projects. The PCU would be responsible for managing the FUSARD through appropriate&#13;
intermediaries, as described in Annexes A and C.&#13;
F. Project Beneficiaries and Participation&#13;
2.14  The main project beneficiaries would be communities of rural poor in some of the&#13;
poorest corregimientos in Panama, principally in the Provinces of Herrera, Veraguas, and&#13;
Los Santos (IBRD Map No. 28338 and Table 1 in Annex A). In addition, many of the&#13;
communities in the PA buffer zones are in the extreme poverty category, many of them&#13;
indigenous. The project would directly benefit approximately 15,000 families or 75,000&#13;
people, assuming 5 people per family. This would be divided between the sustainable&#13;
development component directly covering 11,000 families or 55,000 people, and another&#13;
4,000 families or 20,000 people in the Biodiversity Conservation component. This&#13;
includes in the sustainable development component approximately 2,760 communities, of&#13;
which the project is expected to work directly with about 40 percent or 1,100.&#13;
2.15  There was a considerable amount of local participation in the preparation of the&#13;
project through participatory rural diagnostics and consultations carried out over a two&#13;
month period in the project areas, followed up by community visits by the specialist&#13;
consultants for a five month period. In addition, 10 formal workshops and seminars were&#13;
held with over 360 stakeholders including government, NGOs, foundations and other&#13;
national, regional and local level organizations operating in the project areas. In addition,&#13;
over 25 community level workshops were held, as well a large number of formal and&#13;
informal consultations with the public and private institutions that would be involved in&#13;
project implementation. Several of these consultations, diagnostics and information&#13;
sharing were held in indigenous communities; an indigenous peoples development plan&#13;
(IPDP) was completed (Annex D), and the results incorporated into the formulation of the&#13;
project. Training was provided to government officials in participatory diagnostics, which&#13;
they have continued to implement. This same participatory approach would continue to&#13;
be utilized during project implementation, with the collaboration of NGOs which would&#13;
operate in the project area. Further preparation is required to complete what would be the&#13;
proposal for Panama's contribution to the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor, included in&#13;
the Biodiversity Conservation component. In addition to preparing the overall corridor&#13;
strategy, review of the proposed protected area investments in light of the strategy, and&#13;
ongoing participation and consultation processes with stakeholders to ensure proper&#13;
design would be carried out.&#13;
G. Gender Aspects&#13;
2.16  In developing the communities' self-management capacity, special attention and&#13;
targeting would be used to promote women's active participation in the training,&#13;
organization, planning and subproject implementation. In addition, the project would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
support women's groups, several of which are already being assisted by MIDA, and&#13;
promote the association of these groups to provide certain economies of scale (e.g.&#13;
marketing). To promote women's participation during the community training and&#13;
organization stage, two people from each community, a man and a woman, would be sent&#13;
to training centers to receive more intensive training which they would then apply in their&#13;
communities. Specific training would be provided to women who form part of mixed&#13;
groups, or all-women groups, in areas they request. According to the diagnostics carried&#13;
out during project preparation, the areas of greatest interest to women include project&#13;
management, basic accounting, food processing (agro-industries), medicinal plants and&#13;
marketing. Gender analysis aimed at ensuring greater women's participation would also&#13;
be one of the subproject selection criteria.&#13;
H. Indigenous Peoples Aspects&#13;
2.17  The indigenous populations are the poorest in Panama. The preparation of the&#13;
IPDP and the rural diagnostics provided the project's orientation towards implementing its&#13;
activities in indigenous lands (Annex D). Indigenous groups demonstrated considerable&#13;
interest in carrying out additional income generating productive activities, but not at the&#13;
expense of their culture, forms of government or traditions. The traditional local&#13;
organization structures/government would be utilized to channel assistance to implement&#13;
the training, organization and planning stages, as well as the implementation of the&#13;
subprojects. Where possible, activities would be carried out in local languages or dialects,&#13;
and activities would attempt to take advantage of their knowledge of natural resource use&#13;
and management. Particular areas of interest expressed by indigenous populations include&#13;
improved demarcation and legal recognition of their lands, agricultural techniques for&#13;
subsistence agriculture and sale of surpluses, handicrafts improvements and marketing,&#13;
medicinal plants marketing, and eco- and ethno-tourism. Women's groups would also be&#13;
encouraged and assisted (e.g., handicrafts, certain foodstuffs, medicinal plants). Project&#13;
staff working with indigenous people would be from the same ethnic groups where&#13;
possible.&#13;
I. Costs and Financing&#13;
2.18  Project Costs. Base costs are expressed in July 1996 values, and total costs are&#13;
estimated at US$39.0 million, including incremental recurrent costs, contingencies, duties&#13;
and taxes. Base costs are US$36. 1 million, and contingencies US$2.9 million, calculating&#13;
using applicable norms. The foreign exchange expenditures are estimated to be 14 percent&#13;
of total costs, or $5.3 million. Identifiable taxes and duties are estimated to be $1.2&#13;
million. The main expenditure categories include equipment, technical assistance, training&#13;
and studies, grants for subprojects, operating costs, vehicles and works. The costs are&#13;
summarized in Table I below, and detailed in Annex E.&#13;

2. 19  Project Financing. Table 2 shows project financing by components. The&#13;
Sustainable Rural Development Component would be financed by IBRD, communities and&#13;
GOP. The Biodiversity Conservation Component would be financed by IBRD,&#13;
communities, GEF, and GOP. The Project Coordinating Component would be financed&#13;
by IBRD, GEF and GOP. Overall this corresponds to each financier as follows: IBRD&#13;
$22.5 million (58 percent), which includes the refinancing of US$1.2 million from the&#13;
Project Preparation Facility (PPF), GOP $4.6 million (12 percent), GEF $8.1 million (21&#13;
percent), and communities $3.8 million (10 percent). IBRD financing would be in the&#13;
form of a variable-rate US dollar single currency loan based on Libor. GEF funding is&#13;
subject to GEF Council approval, which will be requested at the May 1997 Council&#13;
meeting, and approval by the Board of the Bank, scheduled for FY98.&#13;

8 Although conceptually and administratively part of the same project, the GEF grant (for the Atlantic&#13;
Biological Corridor) would be managed as a separate financial operation, with different timing,&#13;
documentation, legal agreements and supervision reports. The GEF activities are still under&#13;
preparation, and expected to be submitted for Board approval in FY98. The cost estimates presented of&#13;
GEF financed activities are therefore preliminary and may be changed during on-going preparation of&#13;
the component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
A. Implementation Arrangements&#13;
3.1   Two institutions would be in charge of project implementation - MIDA for the&#13;
Sustainable Rural Development Component and INRENARE for the Biodiversity&#13;
Conservation Component. Each institution would, however, assist the other implement its&#13;
component (e.g., INRENARE would assist MIDA implement reforestation subprojects).&#13;
Both institutions would execute the project through a joint Project Coordination Unit&#13;
(PCU), which would be directed and supervised by a Technical and Operational&#13;
Coordination Council. The FUSARD would be managed by the PCU. Rural communities&#13;
would participate in the implementation of project activities though the Sustainable&#13;
Rural Development Committees (SDCs) established at the local community level.&#13;
Decision-making and technical support would be coordinated-at the corregimiento&#13;
level-by the Corregimiento Technical Committees (CTCs) and-at the provincial&#13;
level-by the Provincial Technical Committees (PTCs). Staff of MIDA, INRENARE&#13;
and municipal governments would be represented on the PTCs. The CTCs would produce&#13;
the Corregimiento Action Plans and, if appropriate, the PTCs would review them on&#13;
technical grounds and rationalize them before incorporating them into Provincial Action&#13;
Plans. The functions of these organizations are further detailed below and in Annex A.&#13;
3.2   Technical and Operational Coordination Council. The Council would advise&#13;
and monitor the execution of the project in order to promote project objectives, meet&#13;
annual operating plans, and establish proper use of project funds. It would include&#13;
representatives of the communities in the project areas, and representatives of the public&#13;
and private sector (local and regional NGOs). The council would be presided by the&#13;
Minister of MIDA or his designated representative. It would include the NAPAS&#13;
Director, a representative of MIPPE, three SDC representatives-one for each&#13;
Province-, a representative of the entrepreneurial private sector, and the Director of the&#13;
PCU who would act as the Council's Executive Secretary.&#13;
3.3   Project Coordinating Unit (PCU). The PCU would be responsible for the&#13;
proper functioning of the project and promoting its objectives. It would not implement&#13;
project actions directly, but rather coordinate and contract the execution to other public&#13;
and private implementing organizations. It would carry out two essential functions: First,&#13;
it would promote, through the contracting of appropriate institutions, the delivery of high&#13;
quality goods and services described in paras 2.12 and 2.13. In many cases, sufficient or&#13;
appropriate skills do not exist in local public or private institutions, thus appropriate&#13;
training must first be provided by the project. This is particularly relevant for the&#13;
Sustainable Rural Development component, and would thus meet one of the project's&#13;
objectives of institutional strengthening. Second, the PCU would monitor and evaluate&#13;
the performance of the above institutions to ensure project objectives are met, community&#13;
training and organization is completed, subprojects implemented as programmed, and&#13;
investments in the selected priority biodiversity areas appropriately completed. Public and&#13;
private institutions (paras 1. 15 and 1.16) would compete for the provision of most of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
services required. It was agreed at negotiations that the PCU would have staff of quality&#13;
and experience satisfactory to the Bank to carry out project activities. The satisfactory&#13;
establishment of the PCU and the Technical and Operational Coordination Council&#13;
would be a condition of Loan effectiveness.&#13;
3.4   Administratively (Annex C) the PCU would be divided in two departments, one for&#13;
each component. The PCU and the Department of Sustainable Rural Development would&#13;
be located in the one of the three Provinces where that component would be implemented,&#13;
and the Department of Biodiversity Conservation would be located at INRENARE&#13;
Headquarters in Panama City, as the project activities are scattered throughout the&#13;
country. The Head of the Sustainable Rural Development Department would coordinate&#13;
with MIDA's staff in the region, many of whom would be seconded to the project. The&#13;
Head of the Biodiversity Conservation component would coordinate with INRENARE&#13;
regional directors in charge of the priority biodiversity areas the project would assist. The&#13;
implementation schedule for the Project is in Annex C. A Subsidiary Agreement between&#13;
Government and INRENARE acceptable to the Bank would be executed as a condition of&#13;
disbursement in respect of the Biodiversity Conservation Component. Because of the&#13;
difficulties of operating within the normal budgetary processes, Government requested&#13;
funds be handled by an external specialized executing agency such as UNDP or IICA. The&#13;
signing of an agency agreement for funds administration between Government and an&#13;
external executing agency, on terms acceptable to the Bank, would be a condition of&#13;
Loan effectiveness. Other financial/administrative functions would be carried out by the&#13;
PCU and similar arrangements are being used for on-going IDB and IFAD projects.&#13;
3.5   Community Organization. To produce the community diagnostics, action plans&#13;
and subprojects, the project would support the establishment of local community&#13;
Sustainable Rural Development Committees. These committees would be formed or&#13;
consolidated by bringing together the various community groupings (e.g., farmers,&#13;
women's groups, church groups and specific committees) to carry out their participatory&#13;
diagnostic with the objective of identifying bottlenecks and solutions to their&#13;
developmental and income generating possibilities. Given the large number of&#13;
communities the project would work with (1,100), it would not be feasible to have an&#13;
external promoter in each locality; instead each community would select two people, a&#13;
woman and a man, to be trained to carry out the training, diagnostic, and the preparation&#13;
of a Community Action Plan (CAP), with the help of specialists as required. They would&#13;
be provided with travel expenses, per diems and certain basic materials (paper, markers,&#13;
etc., used in the participatory methodologies).&#13;
3.6   Once the CAPs are prepared, they would be passed to the Corregimiento&#13;
Technical Committee for review, technical improvement, and, where appropriate,&#13;
rationalized (e.g., where there are repetitions of certain subprojects that are of a wider&#13;
geographic scope such as some possible agro-industrial and watershed subprojects) and&#13;
incorporated in a Provincial Action Plan. The CAPs would contain prioritized subprojects&#13;
and arrangements would be made through the PCU to send the necessary specialists to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
community to prepare the subprojects for submission for funding, be it to the project's&#13;
FUSARD or other sources of funding (e.g., FES).&#13;
3.7   Technical Assistance. The project would provide specialized technical assistance&#13;
as requested by the communities, for the preparation of their action plans and subprojects.&#13;
The diagnostics carried out during project preparation identified the two following areas&#13;
of greatest community interest for productive subprojects: production support, including&#13;
marketing, small agro and cottage industries, rehabilitation of rural roads, and micro-&#13;
irrigation; and production technology, principally by introducing new agricultural&#13;
technology through validation and extension, and reforestation. When technical assistance&#13;
is requested for the above, the services would be contracted from public or private&#13;
organizations through a competitive process. Limited amounts of pesticides would be&#13;
purchased under the project. A condition of disbursementsfor pesticides would be that&#13;
they be on an approved list ofpesticides, satisfactory to the Bank and based on the World&#13;
Health Organization categories I-A, I-B and II.&#13;
3.8   For the production technology services, as limited smallholder agricultural&#13;
technology generation and transfer experience exists in Panama, a different methodology&#13;
would be used to build-up technological options from on-farm validation trials carried out&#13;
with interested project area farmers. With the technical backing of IDIAP, which has&#13;
demonstrated interest in increasing its work with smallholders, and/or other local or&#13;
international institutions, small technical groups would be formed made up of, as required,&#13;
an agronomist, an agricultural economist, an animal production specialist, and a&#13;
sociologist. The team would present technological options developed in areas of similar&#13;
agro-ecological and social conditions in neighboring countries, or locally, where&#13;
experience or information exists. Those deemed by the particular community most suited&#13;
to their particular conditions, would be tried on-farm by interested producers in farmer&#13;
validation groups. Technical support would continue to be provided as producers further&#13;
adapted these technologies and are ready to try new ones. As more technological&#13;
experience becomes available, the extension can become more demand-driven, and local&#13;
farmers involved in the first trials can initiate cross-visit programs to other farmers, as this&#13;
has been shown in various parts of the world to be one of the most effective means of&#13;
transmitting information.&#13;
3.9   Fund for Sustainable Agricultural and Rural Development (FUSARD).&#13;
Located in the PCU, FUSARD would be operated by a Fund Administrator, under the&#13;
directives of a small Board of Directors composed of six directors, appointed respectively&#13;
by MIDA, MIPPE, INRENARE, the NGO community, sub-national government bodies&#13;
and producers/community organizations. The Board would approve the Operational&#13;
Manual, and meet a few times a year to set operating guidelines, supervise performance,&#13;
and ensure proper use of funds. The operational management of FUSARD would be&#13;
carried out by the PCU, whose Coordinator would be responsible for FUSARD's overall&#13;
operation. Within the PCU, a small FUSARD administrative unit would be created, with&#13;
four basic staff (a unit director, an expert in monitoring and evaluation, a lawyer to draw&#13;
up the agreements with the communities and contractors, a disbursement expert, plus&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
support personnel). It is expected that only the unit head would be hired by the project;&#13;
the rest of the personnel would be seconded from MIDA. The subproject technical quality&#13;
control would be carried out by the Corregimiento Technical Committees, and, where&#13;
appropriate, Provincial Technical Committees, and checked by the FUSARD unit. Where&#13;
possible, FUSARD would channel funds through implementing organizations (e.g., NGOs,&#13;
Cooperatives, Government agencies), so as not to deal directly with the disbursement of&#13;
funds for the large number of subprojects expected to be generated. Just as NGOs and&#13;
other implementing organizations have played an important role in project preparation,&#13;
they would also be essential for project execution as only minimal direct implementation&#13;
by Government is envisioned. Criteria for the selection of these organizations would be&#13;
detailed in the Subproject Operation Manual.&#13;
3.10  Subproject Operational Manual. Eligibility criteria and the subproject cycle are&#13;
described in Annex A, and further detailed in the Operational Manual currently being&#13;
finalized by Government. A preliminary version of the Operational Manual, which&#13;
establishes the terms and conditions of grant administration, including technical,&#13;
environmental, and economic criteria, was agreed at negotiations, and the final version,&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, would be a condition of disbursementsfor subprojects. If&#13;
Government wishes, for the final version, it may submit separate Operation Manuals for&#13;
the rural and biodiversity subprojects. An additional condition of disbursement for&#13;
subprojects is the signing of Subproject Agreements acceptable to the Bank with the&#13;
Implementing Organizations.&#13;
3.11  The subproject appraisal by FUSARD would take into account the level of&#13;
participation in the microplanning process, cost-effectiveness, poverty focus, and&#13;
technical, economic, social and environmental sustainability. In addition, the subproject&#13;
preparation would take into account gender analysis which would promote women's&#13;
contribution and benefits in the execution of the subprojects. When funding is approved,&#13;
FUSARD and the community's requesting Implementing Organization, would enter into a&#13;
contract. When a contractor is required (e.g., for infrastructure), the contract would also&#13;
involve the contractor. Once funds are disbursed, which may be in one or more tranches&#13;
depending on the size and complexity of the project, technical supervision would be&#13;
provided by the Implementing Organizations and MIDA, INRENARE, or other line&#13;
agency field staff. Rural roads subprojects would be financed by the project, but&#13;
channeled by the FES considering their considerable experience in this field. Other&#13;
subprojects requested by the communities that could be financed through other existing&#13;
programs/sources of funds (para 1. 15), particularly social infrastructure, would be&#13;
prepared by the project, and project staff would assist the communities make the requests&#13;
for financing at the other programs. This would assist the communities learn to deal with&#13;
other institutions. The use of funds would be closely controlled by the: (i) communities;&#13;
(ii) project (internal audit), (iii) the National Controllers Office, and (iv) annual external&#13;
audits. Most of this review would be ex-post to avoid excessive procedures that could&#13;
reduce agility in the preparation and implementation of subprojects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
3.12  Flow of funds. Project funds would be channeled through an international&#13;
external agent (such as UNDP or IICA) under an Agency Agreement for the provision of&#13;
administrative services. This agreement would be signed with the implementing agencies&#13;
(MIDA and INRENARE) and the selected external agent would provide the services of&#13;
fund administration, including signing of contracts with consultants and suppliers, but&#13;
without responsibility for project implementation, bidding processes, or consultant&#13;
selection. This mechanism, which has been requested by Government, is a common&#13;
practice in Panama to reduce the obstacles created by the cumbersome national&#13;
requirements on procurement, disbursements, accounting and auditing. The external agent&#13;
would be selected through standard consulting services procurement procedures. A&#13;
condition of Loan effectiveness would be the execution of the external Agency Agreement.&#13;
In the case of rural roads financed under FUSARD, the funds would be channeled through&#13;
FES, given its considerable experience in infrastructure subprojects. For other FUSARD&#13;
subprojects, the PCU would request the external agent to transfer funds to the executing&#13;
agency under the provision of an implementation agreement, whose models are defined in&#13;
the Subproject Operational Manual (see Figure 1 of Annex 1). GEF funds would be&#13;
channeled in the same way as IBRD financing. The possibility of using a special account&#13;
(SA) would be left as a possible option (para. 3.26).&#13;
3.13  Counterpart Funds. An assurance of the availability of timely counterpart&#13;
financing, which would total US$4.6 million, was obtained during negotiations. For&#13;
1997, as the budget was prepared before any legal document on the project was available,&#13;
it was not possible to create a budget item for the project. To reduce difficulties, the&#13;
Project Preparation Facility (PPF P306-0 PAN) has been approved to provide, among&#13;
other things, bridge financing before project effectiveness. If the project, as expected,&#13;
becomes effective in 1997, it would be necessary to create an extraordinary line item in the&#13;
1997 budget, which is fairly common in Panama.&#13;
B. Procurement&#13;
3.14 It was agreed at negotiations that procurement under the proposed Bank Loan&#13;
would be in accordance with the Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD loans and IDA&#13;
credits (January 1995, revised January and August 1996) and as further described&#13;
below. Standard bidding documents agreed to by the Bank and the Government would be&#13;
used for the procurement of goods under National Competitive Bidding. The Bank would&#13;
finance civil works, vehicles, equipment, training, consulting services, grants for&#13;
subprojects, and incremental operating costs. Procurement arrangements are summarized&#13;
in Table 3.&#13;

3.15    Works. Civil works would consist of rehabilitation of rural roads, rehabilitation of&#13;
buildings and facilities for office use and construction of small rural markets and protected&#13;
area infrastructure. To the extent possible, contracts would be grouped in packages&#13;
valued at more than US$250,000 and procured under NCB procedures. Small works&#13;
valued at less than US$250,000 would be procured under lump-sum, fixed price contracts&#13;
awarded on the basis of quotations from at least three qualified domestic contractors, up&#13;
to an aggregate amount of US$300,000.&#13;
3.16 Goods. The project would procure vehicles, motorcycles, computer equipment,&#13;
office equipment, furniture, communications equipment, laboratory and field equipment,&#13;
and educational material. Where possible, goods would be packaged into contracts valued&#13;
at US$150,000 or more to be procured under ICB procedures. Vehicles, motorcycles and&#13;
computer equipment would be procured through Limited International Bidding (LIB)&#13;
procedures from suppliers with established maintenance and services facilities in Panama.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
Other goods (office equipment, furniture, etc.) estimated to cost less US$25,000 or more&#13;
but less than US$150,000 per contract would be procured under NCB up to an aggregate&#13;
amount of US$500,000. Contracts for goods valued below US$25,000 would be&#13;
procured using national and international shopping, based on price quotations from at least&#13;
three bidders up to an aggregate amount of US$400,000.&#13;
3.17  Consultant Services and Technical Assistance. All consultant services would&#13;
be procured according to the guidelines, "Use of Consultants by the World Bank&#13;
Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981) ". Consulting,&#13;
training and studies under the project would consist of consultant assignments for&#13;
individuals and firms providing direct technical and implementation assistance to MIDA&#13;
and INRENARE, in, among others, training, land titling, promotion, subprojects,&#13;
establishment of community participatory structures and participatory planning, and&#13;
environment and land use planning and monitoring.&#13;
3.18  Rural Development and Biodiversity subprojects (Grants). The average size&#13;
of a community subproject is expected to be around US$20,000. Few subprojects are&#13;
expected to exceed US$50,000, which would be the normal maximum subproject cost. In&#13;
exceptional cases a maximum of US$100,000 would be allowed, subject to approval by&#13;
FUSARD's Board of Directors. Procurement for subprojects costing the equivalent of&#13;
US$10,000 or less and procured by local communities would be carried out mainly by&#13;
direct contracting, up to an aggregate amount of US$2.5 million. This procurement&#13;
procedure is proposed taking into consideration that most subprojects: (i) would be small&#13;
and it would be difficult to obtain competitive proposals; (ii) can be managed directly by&#13;
communities that would contribute to the work through the donation of unskilled labor&#13;
and local materials; (iii) would be selected on the basis of willingness of the beneficiary&#13;
communities to contribute to and physically supervise their execution; and (iv) would&#13;
provide a vehicle for communities to play an active role in the local development process.&#13;
3.19  Procurement by the communities under the subprojects would follow National&#13;
Shopping procedures for goods, and procedures acceptable to the Bank for procurement&#13;
of small works under lump sum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of price&#13;
quotations (under US$25,000). For details on FUSARD's operation, see Annex A.&#13;

3.20 Post review would be carried out for all other procurement by implementing&#13;
agencies and communities. For this purpose, both MIDA and INRENARE would recruit,&#13;
through the PCU, auditors, under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank (paras. 3.30&#13;
and 3.31), who would not only examine financial implementation, but also procurement&#13;
procedures, physical implementation and impact on beneficiaries. These auditors would&#13;
carry out annual audits on the basis of a sample not lower than 60 percent of the Bank's&#13;
financed investments in the first project year, 50 percent in the second project year and 40&#13;
percent in the remaining years. For convenience and to avoid overlap, the same auditors,&#13;
if their performance is satisfactory, would be eligible to carry out an ex-post review of the&#13;
expenditures and investments financed by the Bank.&#13;
3.21    Provisions in Legal Documents. An assessment by the Bank of Panama's&#13;
procurement procedures and regulations indicates that they are not fully compatible with&#13;
Bank Group procurement guidelines and policy. To resolve inconsistencies between local&#13;
legislation and Bank's procurement guidelines, during negotiations, agreement was&#13;
reached to include the following procurement provisions in the legal documents. 1. For&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
goods and works to be procured under National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures:&#13;
(i) bids may be submitted at any reasonable time before bid opening accompanied by bid&#13;
securities acceptable to the Bank, either by mail or by courier; (ii) the contract would not&#13;
be provisionally awarded at the bid opening session; (iii) no minimum number of bids&#13;
would be required to award a contract, (iv) contracts would be awarded to the lowest&#13;
evaluated bidder; and (v) after contract award, the amounts for performance securities&#13;
would be inform and amount specified in the bidding documents. In addition, for works&#13;
to be procured under NCB, contracts may provide for mobilization advances and price&#13;
adjustment provisions, acceptable to the Bank; 2. For consultants' services, foreign&#13;
consultants would not be required to: (i) be locally registered as a condition of&#13;
participation in the selection process; (ii) give any participation to local consultants;&#13;
(iii) furnish any certificate issued by a local authority about their legal capacity or tax&#13;
status; and (iv) personally submit their proposals.&#13;
C. Disbursements&#13;
3.22  The IBRD loan has a five-year disbursement period and the Closing Date would be&#13;
June 30, 2002. (It is expected that the associated GEF grant would have also a five-year&#13;
disbursement period subject to GEF Council approval). There is no Standard&#13;
Disbursement Profile relevant to agriculture or natural resources projects in Panama, so&#13;
the country's overall disbursement profile has been used to estimate annual disbursements&#13;
(Annex E, Table 5).&#13;
3.23  The Loan would be disbursed against eligible project expenditures at the rates of:&#13;
(i) 80 percent for civil works; (ii) 100 percent for foreign supplied and 80 percent of&#13;
locally supplied machinery, equipment, vehicles, and furniture; (iii) 100 percent for&#13;
consultant services, training and studies; (iv) 100 percent of non-beneficiary financing of&#13;
grants for community subprojects; and iv) incremental recurrent costs on a declining basis&#13;
(90 percent first two years, 60 percent third and fourth years and 40 percent thereafter).&#13;
(Annex E, page 4).&#13;
3.24  Retroactive Financing. Agreed project activities after January 1, 1997 would be&#13;
eligible for retroactive financing, up to a maximum of US$2.0 million.&#13;
3.25  Documentation of Expenditures. Disbursements would be made on the basis of&#13;
full documentation for all expenditures made under contracts requiring prior review by the&#13;
Bank and amendments to contracts raising the value of such contracts above the prior&#13;
review limits (Table 4). For all other expenditures, training, grants and recurrent costs&#13;
disbursements would be made against Statements of Expenditures (SOE) for which&#13;
supporting documents would be maintained by MIDA and INRENARE and would be&#13;
available to the Bank for review.&#13;
3.26 Special Account. At Government's request, an international external agent would&#13;
be contracted for procurement (para 3.12). However, should government wish to take&#13;
over procurement directly, a Special Account (SA) in US dollars could be opened in a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
bank acceptable to IBRD, and would be managed by the PCU. The authorized allocation&#13;
in the SA would be US$1.4 million corresponding to about four months of average&#13;
expenditures under the project. The initial deposit would be US$500,000 and once total&#13;
disbursements have reached US$3.5 million, the Borrower may request the balance of the&#13;
authorized allocation to be released. The SA would be replenished monthly on the&#13;
Borrower's request (but no less frequently than every three months), or whenever one&#13;
third of the authorized amount has been withdrawn, whichever occurs first.&#13;
3.27 Documentation. The PCU would be responsible for submitting regular&#13;
replenishment requests with appropriate supporting documents for expenditures under the&#13;
project. The documents would include: (i) a standard withdrawal application (Form&#13;
1903) for the total amount of eligible project expenditures to be replenished into the&#13;
international external agent's account or the Special Account with a copy of the monthly&#13;
bank statement for that account; (ii) Statement of Expenses (SOEs), for expenditures not&#13;
requiring documentation, including grants to communities; (iii) summary sheets for fully&#13;
documented expenditures (designed for each subproject and included in the disbursement&#13;
letter) with the supporting documentation for all expenditures above the procurement&#13;
prior review thresholds; and (iv) a reconciliation statement for the agent or the SA. The&#13;
use of grants by communities would be checked through technical and financial audits, the&#13;
monitoring systems and project and subproject supervision arrangements.&#13;
D. Accounts and Audits&#13;
3.28 Project Financial Statements and Financial Reporting. The PCU would be&#13;
responsible for preparing project financial statements including a statement of sources and&#13;
uses of funds, and a register of project assets or balance sheet where appropriate. The&#13;
funds flow statement would indicate sources (the Bank, GEF, as well as counterpart&#13;
financing) and expenditures in accordance with main project components and&#13;
disbursement categories. Project financial statements would show actual and pending&#13;
payments against those budgeted. Information on sources and uses of funds would be&#13;
provided monthly to the PCU. Information reported would also include the value of&#13;
contracts signed, i.e., commitments, relative to actual and pending payments.&#13;
3.29 MIDA and INRENARE would maintain separate records and accounts for project&#13;
expenditures as well as a register of assets purchased with project funds. They would also&#13;
have the responsibility for preparing the project's financial statements, including balance&#13;
sheets and sources and uses of funds statements, according to internationally accepted&#13;
accounting standards. MIDA and INRENARE would also receive technical assistance to&#13;
help establish accounting procedures acceptable to the Bank. Separate accounts would&#13;
be established for GEF and Bank funds.&#13;
3.30  Auditing. A process for selection of financial and technical auditors, their TORs,&#13;
and auditing arrangements, as described below, would be agreed with MIDA and&#13;
INRENARE during negotiations. The selection process includes pre-qualifying audit&#13;
firms, contracting auditors for one year with a provision to extend for a further two years&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
based on satisfactory performance. The process for selection of auditors would be&#13;
initiated during the PPF stage with the objective of having auditors in place by the start of&#13;
Loan disbursements. The PCU would contract audit firms to audit the consolidated&#13;
financial statements for the components of the project. Separate audits would be carried&#13;
out for GEF and Bank funds.&#13;
3.31   The auditors report would include audits of the external agent or the SA, an&#13;
opinion on the use of statement of expenditures (SOEs), confirmation that project&#13;
implementation was in accordance with provisions of the Loan Agreement and verification&#13;
of procurement transactions. The auditor's TORs would also include a review of internal&#13;
controls and preparation of a management letter. Audit reports would be submitted to the&#13;
Bank within six months of the close of the fiscal year. The first audit reports would cover&#13;
the first year's disbursement as well as disbursements under the PPF.&#13;
3.32  Annual technical audits would be carried out separately and would consist of&#13;
checks of subprojects ensuring that what is purchased is in fact there and would include&#13;
assessments of whether resources were used efficiently or appropriately or any technical&#13;
issues worth analyzing. The methodology would include having an adequate sample of&#13;
subprojects selected in accordance with criteria acceptable to the Bank. The report of the&#13;
technical audit would be submitted to the Bank within two months of the end of the fiscal&#13;
year.&#13;
E. Status of Project Readiness&#13;
3.33  With the approval of a PPF for the project, and with RUTA's assistance,&#13;
Government has initiated the advertising of key positions for the PCU. It is expected&#13;
several members of the Project Preparation Unit would form part of the PCU, thus&#13;
providing for a smoother transition to implementation. The initiation of the project with a&#13;
pilot PPF stage would allow for a simpler start and provide the opportunity to apply the&#13;
learning curve. RUTA is also organizing a project management course for April 1997.&#13;
The Living Standards Measurements Survey, which was co-financed by project&#13;
preparation funds, would also provide detailed base-line information for the project. Thus&#13;
overall, considerable effort is going into initiating project activities in an organized, small&#13;
scale, pilot fashion, which should allow for a more rapid and effective project start-up&#13;
once the Loan is effective.&#13;
F. Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
3.34  Supervision. Day-to-day supervision of the project would be carried out by the&#13;
PCU with MIDA and INRENARE. IBRD and GOP would monitor the project's overall&#13;
progress during joint supervision missions, annual reviews and an Implementation&#13;
Completion Review.&#13;
3.35  Because of the large number of subprojects that would be financed under the&#13;
Sustainable Rural Development Component and to a lesser degree, the Biodiversity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
Conservation Component, the demands for close supervision would be high, and funds&#13;
have been made available for the PCU to enable it to carry out these functions. There&#13;
would be four supervision mechanisms for activities carried out by the communities in the&#13;
project area: (i) by communities: the community level Sustainable Rural Development&#13;
Committee (SDC) would supervise implementation of their subprojects, supervising in&#13;
particular the execution carried out by contractors; (ii) by the Implementing Organizations&#13;
(e.g., NGOs): these would supervise subprojects executed by contractors implementing&#13;
subprojects on behalf of communities; (iii) by the PCU: project staff would supervise the&#13;
work of the communities, implementing organizations and contractors to assess whether&#13;
the Corregimiento Action Plans, the subproject preparation and implementation by&#13;
contractors with implementing organizations oversight, are carried out according to plan;&#13;
and (iv) for the supervision of funds use, four levels of control would exist: the&#13;
community, the project's internal audit, the annual external audits, and the National&#13;
Controllers Office.&#13;
3.36 Monitoring. Based on an Annual Operating Plan agreed with the Bank, the PCU,&#13;
with MIDA and INRENARE, would monitor overall project progress and provide&#13;
quarterly reports (for the periods ending March 31, June 30, September 30 and December&#13;
31) to the Minister of MIPPE and IBRD. An outline for quarterly reports is included in&#13;
Annex F. Progress would be measured against the implementation indicators included in&#13;
that Annex. An assurance was obtained at negotiations that annual operating plans&#13;
would be agreed with the Bank, and monitoring reports would be furnished to IBRD no&#13;
more than 45 days after the completion of each quarter.&#13;
3.37  Project Launch Workshops. Upon project effectiveness, the Government,&#13;
through the PCU, would organize project launch workshops targeted at: (a) MIDA and&#13;
INRENARE; (b) community leaders at the local and provincial levels; (c) local NGO,&#13;
cooperative and other possible Implementing Organizations; and (c) other Government&#13;
agencies supporting the project. An initial project management workshop organized by&#13;
RUTA, would be implemented at the during in April 1997.&#13;
3.38  Supervision Missions. At least twice a year, GOP and IBRD would organize&#13;
joint project supervision missions. Project supervision would also provide implementation&#13;
assistance. Before each mission, G'P and IBRD would agree on the major subjects to be&#13;
supervised, which would include an evaluation of the project's progress based on the&#13;
Annual Operating Plan, monitoring indicators, compliance with legal covenants, and&#13;
procurement and financial management, as detailed in Annex F. At the conclusion of each&#13;
mission, the Bank would provide an Aide Memoire to GOP that would contain the&#13;
findings of the mission and recommendations.&#13;
3.39 Annual Reviews. Each year, GOP and IBRD would carry out an annual review.&#13;
Before such a review would take place, GOP and IBRD would agree on detailed TORs&#13;
and staffing of the review teams. These reviews would have elements of supervision and&#13;
may be combined with a supervision mission, but would focus more on project impact&#13;
(evaluation) and operational changes required to correct obstacles or bottlenecks to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
meeting project objectives. The review would cover the status of such issues as follows,&#13;
which are further detailed in Annex F: (i) community participation and role of the project&#13;
and implementing organizations in promoting it; (ii) technical assistance and training&#13;
program for the project staff and communities; (iii) training of consultants and local&#13;
availability of trained consultants and Implementing Organizations; (iv) functioning of the&#13;
subproject cycle; and (v) infrastructure and management in the protected area system.&#13;
Following these reviews GOP would, within forty-five days of the review, draw up an&#13;
action plan, satisfactory to IBRD, to make adjustments in project implementation&#13;
wherever necessary and promptly carry out the plan. It was agreed at negotiations that&#13;
adjustments, if necessary, to project implementation plans, satisfactory to IBRD, would&#13;
be carried out forty-five days after annual reviews.&#13;
3.40 Implementation Completion Report. An assurance was obtained at&#13;
negotiations that, not later than six months after the project closing date, GOP and IBRD&#13;
would carry out a joint project completion review and produce an Implementation&#13;
Completion Report. Following this review, GOP would present to EBRD a plan for the&#13;
future operation of the project, furnish the plan to IBRD for comments, and carry out the&#13;
plan taking into account IBRD's comments thereon.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
IV. EXPECTED BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Social Impact&#13;
4.1   It is expected the project would have a significant positive social impact on project&#13;
beneficiaries by providing them with improved economic opportunities both for the short&#13;
and long term. Their better management of natural resources, an environmental benefit,&#13;
would also yield social and economic benefits through improved living conditions from&#13;
more productive soils, forests and water sources. Perhaps the greatest and most lasting&#13;
benefit the project would provide, given the paternalistic approach to rural development&#13;
often adopted by governments in the past, would be to provide communities with the tools&#13;
and the practical experience in identifying their problems, analyzing their causes,&#13;
proposing solutions, preparing projects to implement the solutions, execute the projects&#13;
and monitor and evaluate their effectiveness. Training in this type of participatory&#13;
planning is remarkably enduring: in Honduras there are communities that continue to use&#13;
the technique up to ten years after it had been taught to them.&#13;
4.2  Direct benefits would accrue to approximately 75,000 people or 15,000 families in&#13;
the poverty areas and the buffer zones spread over more than 100 corregimientos.&#13;
Indirect effects would accrue to at least 30 percent more people, or another 25,000&#13;
(service providers, farmers and consumers that benefit from better local and regional&#13;
marketing facilities, communities outside the project area that benefit from improved&#13;
roads, watershed management, etc.). Land tenure regularization related to the protected&#13;
areas would not adversely affect farmers as Government has a policy against resettlement&#13;
of squatters who have lived in protected areas before their creation or for extended&#13;
periods of time. An assurance was obtained at negotiations that no involuntary&#13;
resettlement would be carried out under the project. This restriction has been reflected in&#13;
the legal documents and will be included in the project's Operational Manual.&#13;
4.3    Approximately 70 percent of the project area communities are below the poverty&#13;
line, and a significant number of these below the extreme poverty line. Although the&#13;
project would not finance labor, the subprojects would generate fuller or new employment&#13;
at low cost: e.g., the investments in agricultural technology would cost between $600 -&#13;
$2,500 per farm, which is significantly less than creating employment in micro or small&#13;
enterprises, estimated between $3,000 and $5,000. Total employment created cannot be&#13;
calculated for a demand-driven fund like the FUSARD, but indicative employment for&#13;
typical subprojects is estimated in Table 5.&#13;
4.4    Women's benefits would derive from the targeted project interventions aiming to&#13;
provide them with equal access to participation in the planning process, training,&#13;
specialized technical assistance, and investment funds. During project preparation, women&#13;
in the project area identified certain areas of greater economic/productive interest which&#13;
would be provided with specialized assistance (marketing, agro-industries, small livestock&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
raising, medicinal plant marketing, and marketable handicraft), but other areas would also&#13;
be attended as requested to provide them with the technical and financial tools to improve&#13;
their economic opportunities.&#13;
4.5   In those project areas where the indigenous populations are not being attended by&#13;
other on-going projects (e.g., the ongoing IFAD Ngobe-Bugle project which carries out&#13;
actions in some of the rural development areas), a special program outlined in the IPDP&#13;
and Annex D would provide project services to improve the situation of the indigenous&#13;
populations, among the poorest of the extreme poverty group. Initial emphasis would be&#13;
on improving the agricultural crop/livestock subsistence level of families, which in many&#13;
cases are below even a minimum acceptable level where malnutrition is prevalent. As a&#13;
second step, they would enter into or increase the production of marketable surpluses&#13;
including crops, livestock and handicrafts for which there is considerable demand. These&#13;
actions, carried out in accordance with indigenous governance and cultural values, is&#13;
expected to provide the tools for a longer term improvement in their living standards.&#13;
When there has been assistance to indigenous groups, it has been mostly through social&#13;
services delivered in the paternalistic fashion described before, and there has been little&#13;
emphasis on developing productive activities that this project would concentrate its&#13;
actions on.&#13;
B. Environmental and Economical Analysis&#13;
4.6   The project's direct environmental benefits are considerable, even ifjust the&#13;
Biodiversity Component is taken into account, which alone covers 913,000 ha,&#13;
corresponding to 52 percent of the NAPAS and 12 percent of the national territory. The&#13;
biodiversity represented is of national, regional and global importance. Regionally, the&#13;
Panamanian segment of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor, including the Choco-&#13;
Darien Humid Tropical Broadleaf Forests and others of global importance, would be&#13;
protected. While it is difficult to quantify the various environmental benefits, for&#13;
illustrative effects, it has been done for the national benefits of soil conservation and&#13;
mangroves.&#13;
4.7   Soil Conservation. The Sustainable Development area contains approximately&#13;
650,000 ha of land under agricultural activity. It is estimated conservatively the project&#13;
would improve soil conservation measures under 12 percent of the area. Taken as a&#13;
weighted average of the soil losses that can realistically be expected under the above land&#13;
uses, the project can reduce losses by 62 percent, or 2.4 million tons of non-sustainable&#13;
soil losses/year which is valued annually at approximately $220,000 or an NPV of $1.6&#13;
million over 20 years.&#13;
4.8   Mangroves. Mangroves are highly productive ecosystems yielding fish, mollusks,&#13;
shrimp, wood, etc. Panama is no exception and they are highly valued. According to the&#13;
use given, these resources have been valued from US$700 to $10,000/ha. Mangroves are,&#13;
however, sensitive to contamination, including from excessive sedimentation carried by the&#13;
rivers that feed into the mangroves. The sustainable development component area on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
Pacific is upriver from the largest mangroves in Panama at Golfo de Montijo and Golfo de&#13;
Parrita. If it is assumed that the project's soil conservation and reforestation activities&#13;
would protect 20% of the mangrove's area (almost 7,000 ha) that would otherwise&#13;
disappear, and using the low value estimate, the 20 year NPV would equal $11.4 million.&#13;
4.9     Community subprojects. The largest component of the project is the demand&#13;
driven fund, the FUSARD, expected to benefit approximately 1,100 communities. It is&#13;
not possible to determine ahead of time for what type and in what quantity the totality of&#13;
the grant and counterpart community funds would be used. Nonetheless, the participatory&#13;
diagnostics carried out during project preparation, gave an idea of the sorts of productive&#13;
investments the communities are most interested in. Illustrative financial analysis was&#13;
carried out for 12 probable investments: timber species seed processing, nurseries (pine&#13;
and fruit), pine plantations (1 ha, and 4000 ha), Cedro plantations (1 ha), lumber, cheese,&#13;
coffee, and fruit processing plants, farm technologies, and two export crops. The results,&#13;
summarized below, and further detailed in Annex G, are positive, with rates of return&#13;
between 13 and 24 percent, and quantifiable benefit:cost ratios between 1.0 and 12.8. An&#13;
indicative distribution of investments from FUSARD is in Table 6 of Annex A,&#13;

4.10   In addition to the above quantifiable financial benefits, decentralized community or&#13;
municipal investments of the demand-driven nature have been shown to be more cost-&#13;
effective than centrally controlled investments, in terms of cost, completion time, and a&#13;
more efficient mix of local investments, which, because of local participation, are used&#13;
more often and better maintained. Other benefits are improved local decision-making by&#13;
communities, and higher productivity of farmers from training activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
C. Sustainability&#13;
4.11   There are various dimensions to sustainability of the two main project components:&#13;
the community subprojects, related mostly to the Sustainable Development Component,&#13;
and the natural resource conservation and management, related mostly to the Biodiversity&#13;
Management Component.&#13;
4.12 The sustainability of the participatory community planning and subprojects is&#13;
expected because of the demand-driven participatory process that would allow the&#13;
communities to define their own priorities and be directly involved in their implementation,&#13;
use and maintenance, as opposed to previous government interventions where decisions&#13;
were made centrally and often did not adequately involve the communities. Proper&#13;
financial, environmental, social and management criteria would be used to assure&#13;
subproject viability. More important for the longer term, members of the communities&#13;
would be trained and have hands-on experience in identifying problems, defining solutions,&#13;
and implementing and maintaining them, as well as dealing directly and demanding more&#13;
of their government. If the methodology is successful, which it has proven to be in other&#13;
countries, it is possible the government, with Bank support, could expand this investment&#13;
methodology in Panama.&#13;
4.13   The sustainability of the PA system in the Pacific and the Biodiversity Corridor in&#13;
the Atlantic would be improved by four actions: (a) improving the management of the PA&#13;
system in INRENARE through intensive training, new management systems, and proper&#13;
equipping; (b) resolving the land tenure problems on the PA boundaries and within the&#13;
parks; (c) providing a source of income for the system, through park entrance and user&#13;
fees, thereby making it less dependent on the vagaries of the national budgetary process&#13;
and external donations; and iv) identifying financial means to capture a larger share of the&#13;
external benefits of biodiversity protection in Panama. In addition, the sustainability of the&#13;
Panamanian portion of the Mesoamerican Corridor would be assured by the above&#13;
investments to the protected areas, as well as an intensive environmental education&#13;
programs and a community demand-driven investment program in the areas outside the&#13;
protected areas which would encourage sustainable development consistent with corridor&#13;
protection.&#13;
4.14 Protected Areas Investments. At present, entrance fees to the protected areas are&#13;
not charged. INRENARE has considered changing this policy, in order to capture a larger&#13;
share of the internal and external or global benefits of biodiversity protection.&#13;
INRENARE would begin charging visitors once they have the infrastructure to receive&#13;
them. They would charge $2 to nationals, and $5 to foreign visitors. Rates for scientific&#13;
visitors are being studied considering longer stays, and the requirement for living, eating&#13;
and laboratory facilities which the project would also provide. This concept is not new in&#13;
Panama; the Smithsonian Institution charges visiting scientists fees for using their facilities&#13;
in protected areas. An analysis of four protected areas with the greatest potential -&#13;
Bastimento, La Amistad, Volcan Baruf, and Taboga - shows that operational costs, both&#13;
existing and incremental, can be covered by year eight assuming part of the investment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
costs would be covered by the proposed GEF grant. This would guarantee the&#13;
sustainability of GEF supported investments.&#13;
D. Summary of Project Benefits&#13;
4.15  The project would yield two principal benefits: (a) creation of a capacity at the&#13;
community level to organize, self-diagnose problems, plan through participatory means,&#13;
seek out and negotiate assistance, and act in pursuit of resolving priority quality of life&#13;
issues. This community capacity has been shown to be remarkably enduring, generally&#13;
well beyond an expected project completion period; and (b) promotion of the long-term&#13;
conservation and sustainable use of Panama's unique biodiversity resources. The first&#13;
benefit would be achieved in one region of the country, and if successful could be&#13;
expanded nationally; the second would cover most of the protected areas and the&#13;
Panamanian portion of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor not assisted by other&#13;
donors. The quantifiable benefits are considerable: approximately 75,000 people would be&#13;
directly benefited, most of whom live in poverty, and another 25,000 indirectly, covering&#13;
approximately 1,100 communities in the Sustainable Rural Development Component.&#13;
Moreover, over 910,000 ha of protected areas would be strengthened, and an even larger&#13;
area (the Panamanian portion of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor) managed in a&#13;
more sustainable fashion.&#13;
E. Project Risks&#13;
4.16 Three main risks are foreseen. One is the risk of continuing deforestation and&#13;
natural resource degradation in the project areas. The basic premise of the project itself&#13;
points towards reducing this problem, by (a) reducing the root causes of out-migration&#13;
from poverty areas to protected areas; (b) carrying out environmentally sustainable and&#13;
productive activities in the buffer zones of the protected areas that would make the&#13;
surrounding communities more conscious of the benefits to them and the country of&#13;
conserving the protected areas; and (c) carrying out land titling on private properties that&#13;
border the protected areas, thereby more clearly establishing tenure and thus promoting&#13;
sustainable use.&#13;
4.17  Another risk is whether the institutional capacity is adequate to execute the&#13;
project. Both MIDA and INRENARE have recognized their weaknesses in this respect&#13;
and during project preparation an intensive training program has been drawn up to deal&#13;
with this. In addition, training would be provided to private organizations that would&#13;
assist in project implementation. Recognizing their responsibility to small as well as to&#13;
medium and large farmers, MIDA has recently begun working with small farmers,&#13;
initiating several small farmer projects using Government budgetary funds as well as funds&#13;
from international donors.&#13;
4.18  Inadequate counterpart funding has been a risk in many countries, and efforts have&#13;
been made to reduce this risk in this project by focusing on high priority areas, and limiting&#13;
many project activities to a pilot phase. Community cofinancing of subprojects reduces&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
the Government counterpart financing requirement for the project and growing entrance&#13;
and user fees for protected areas would over time reduce budgetary requirements&#13;
associated with project objectives, as would carbon sequestration agreements, if they are&#13;
implemented in the future. In addition, Government's decision to use the Project&#13;
Preparation Facility prior to Bank approval of the full loan is an indication of the high&#13;
priority it attaches to the project.&#13;

PANAMA&#13;
RURAL POVERTY AND NATURAL RESOURCE PROJECT&#13;
Sustainable Rural Development Component&#13;
1.    This component is divided in two: (i) the training and organization of communities&#13;
into Sustainable Development Communities to undertake communal planning including:&#13;
diagnosis of community development bottlenecks, followed by a Community Action Plan&#13;
(CAP), and then specific investments or subprojects that would operationalize the CAP.&#13;
The CAPs from all the Sustainable Development Communities would be combined at the&#13;
corregimiento and provincial levels; and (ii) the implementation of prioritized subprojects&#13;
which will be financed by the Fund for Sustainable Agricultural Rural Development&#13;
(FUSARD). Some of the subprojects would also be financed by other funding sources,&#13;
where available, such as the FES or PROINLO programs (see Chapter 1). This Annex&#13;
covers the technical support services the project would provide to the communities, and in&#13;
Appendix 1, FUSARD's operation which also includes details of the community training&#13;
and organization methodologies.&#13;
Community Organization&#13;
2.    Before the communities receive project staff, this staff must be properly trained in&#13;
community planning and organization skills. This personnel would include reassigned&#13;
MIDA staff, and contracted NGO and local organizations (e.g., producer organizations,&#13;
cooperatives) staff. They would receive training in participatory communal diagnosis,&#13;
planning and project formulation. This would be complemented with related skills training&#13;
including group dynamics, negotiations and leadership skills. Not all staff would necessarily&#13;
have the ability to become communal promoters and carry out these functions; instead they&#13;
could be assigned one of the more specific technical skills. These technical staff (see below)&#13;
would also receive refresher courses and more in depth training where necessary. Full&#13;
details of the training program for staff and communities is in Document 5 of Annex H.&#13;
3.    At the community level, to form the Sustainable Rural Development Committees&#13;
(SDC) which would carry out the community planning described above, the community&#13;
promoter would begin by describing the project and its objectives; carrying out an inventory&#13;
of all the formal and informal groups in the community including youth groups (e.g.,&#13;
women's, church, education, producers, marketing, road); integrating these groups into a&#13;
SDC; choosing two community representatives - a woman and a man - which would be sent&#13;
to specialized centers for training in communal planning, they would return to initiate the&#13;
participatory planning process in the community, with the specialized technical assistance of&#13;
project staff as needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX A&#13;
Page 2 of 18&#13;
4.    It is estimated that during the project period, 220 SDCs would be formed, to&#13;
organize 11,000 families for an estimated population of 55,000 people. 440 community&#13;
representatives would be trained. This process would cost approximately $2.2 million,&#13;
divided as follows: $1.27 million to form the 220 SDCs ($5,800 each) which includes&#13;
training, technical assistance, and related logistical support. Community promoter training&#13;
(project staff) would cost $78,000, community representatives $194,000, and technical&#13;
assistance to the communities $651,OOOmn.&#13;
Specialized Technical Assistance&#13;
5.    In the community diagnostics carried out during project preparation, most&#13;
communities identified the following areas of greatest interest for the purpose of developing&#13;
productive projects: production technology: agricultural technology, mini-irrigation, social&#13;
reforestation; and production support: marketing, agroindustries, rehabilitation of rural&#13;
roads. Other areas of interest were also identified, which could also be attended by the&#13;
project as all subprojects identified would be demand-driven. As the above were the most&#13;
commonly requested, specialized technical assistance delivery and possible solutions are&#13;
described below. The implementation of this assistance would be through subproject&#13;
(FUSARD or other) financing.&#13;
Production Technology&#13;
6.    Agricultural and Agroforestry Production Systems. The objective would be to&#13;
facilitate the process of the adoption of agricultural and agroforestry technologies, tailored&#13;
to the economic, natural resource, labor, and land possibilities of the producer and his&#13;
family. This area of assistance starts off with a major disadvantage which is that Panama&#13;
has not adequately developed smallholder technology: formal Government research has&#13;
emphasized only commercial agriculture for medium and large farmers. The following is the&#13;
methodology the project would utilize at least initially, to introduce smallholder&#13;
technologies, while sufficient appropriate technological options become available from&#13;
project activities.&#13;
7.    First, the Sustainable Development Component project area was divided into three&#13;
principle agroecological zones to determine possible technologies that could be introduced.&#13;
Second, a typology of the producers was carried out to determine their possibilities for&#13;
technology adoption (e.g. subsistence, subsistence and marketable surplus, mostly surplus).&#13;
Third, technologies developed for regions ecologically and socially similar in neighboring&#13;
countries were explored to determine suitability and possible adaptability to the project&#13;
area. Fourth, the Agricultural Research Institute (IDIAP) has expressed interest in&#13;
supporting smallholder research, even if they were unable to carry out all the investigation&#13;
themselves. They, or another national or international institute, would therefore provide&#13;
technical support to this technology validation and extension proposal. Fifth, to deliver the&#13;
services to the field, the following logistical set-up would be utilized.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX A&#13;
Page 3 of 18&#13;
8.    Communities that express interest in adopting new production technologies would&#13;
receive the assistance from small multidisciplinary technical groups made up of an&#13;
agronomist, an animal production specialist, an agricultural economist, and a sociologist.&#13;
The team would present technical options, and those deemed by the particular community&#13;
to be suited to their particular conditions would be tried on-farm by interested producers&#13;
through validation trials. Technical support would continue to be provided as producers&#13;
adapted the technologies and become ready to try new ones. As proven technologies are&#13;
developed, farmer to farmer extension would be encouraged. Details of the technical&#13;
options proposed for different level producers are in the Document No. 3 of the Project File&#13;
(Annex H). It is estimated these technologies would cover a majority of the families in the&#13;
project area, and costs are estimated at $6.15 million, of which $3.3mn would be used for&#13;
technical assistance, training, the costs of the technical specialists, and logistics support. The&#13;
actual subprojects implemented by the producers would total $2.86 million which would&#13;
cover the costs of purchased inputs for the first one or two years to reduce the risks&#13;
associated with technology adoption. The project would cover these costs because families&#13;
in poverty are often unwilling to try new technologies because their fragile finances are&#13;
unable to suffer losses from crop failures for even one year, even though only a portion of&#13;
the farm would be utilized to try the new technologies.&#13;
9.    Mini-irrigation schemes. The objective is to increase productivity and increase&#13;
crop diversification by extending the growing reason and reducing risk. These schemes&#13;
would be set up in those communities that express interest, and where water is available at a&#13;
relatively low cost (e.g. does not come from deep pump wells). Emphasis would be on&#13;
producing for surplus/markets (local and export), rather than for subsistence, as this would&#13;
be the only way to cover irrigation installation, operating and maintenance costs.&#13;
10.   Grouped individual producers forming community projects of up to 10 ha would be&#13;
assisted, as well as individual plots, though the assistance provided by the project to each&#13;
would vary. The community projects would be assisted with technical assistance for the&#13;
design and with purchased inputs, whereas the individual plots would be provided with only&#13;
technical assistance. MIDA's Department of Rural Engineering would assist the smaller&#13;
projects, whereas the larger ones could be covered by private firms. With an estimated 50&#13;
projects of lOha, and 100 of 1 ha, the total costs are $0.5mn divided between technical&#13;
assistance, inputs, and labor costs.&#13;
11.   Community Reforestation. The objective would be to reforest soils with little or no&#13;
agricultural potential for the medium and long term economic and environmental benefit of&#13;
small farmers. This would be carried out mainly, but not exclusively, in communities that&#13;
are already convinced of the benefits of reforestation through earlier reforestation schemes&#13;
initiated in the 1 970s. Some are being harvested now and the communities are receiving the&#13;
benefits from these harvests. Several schemes would be assisted: (i) timber seed processing&#13;
facilities, particularly for pine, but also native species appropriate for the area. Panama&#13;
imports a large percentage of its seed requirements, when this could be procured locally; (ii)&#13;
commercial nurseries to provide the interested communities and commercial reforesters&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX A&#13;
Page 4 of 18&#13;
with seedlings grown utilizing improved technologies (e.g., root trainers). In addition, fruit&#13;
trees would also be raised for sale; (iii) reforestation schemes for individual and collective&#13;
farms; and (iv) small portable saw mills. INRENARE would provide the technical criteria&#13;
and assistance for the timber reforestation, while MIDA for the fruit trees.&#13;
12.   Estimated demand is 3 seed processing facilities owned by 10 families each, 9&#13;
commercial nurseries, owned by approximately 45 families each which would produce&#13;
about 250,000 trees each, and reforest about 6,000 ha of which 2,000 would be with native&#13;
species, and 4,000 ha in pine, benefiting 5,000 families. Total estimated costs of this sub-&#13;
component are $1.5 million, of which $22,000 would be used for training and the rest to&#13;
finance reforestation subprojects, principally purchased inputs.&#13;
Production Support&#13;
13.   Marketing. This is seen as a crucial aspect of income generation as the market&#13;
drives the financial viability of increased production. Several actions would be promoted: (i)&#13;
strengthening public and private institutions related to the provision of this service,&#13;
including for market price information, market intelligence, contracts with buyers,&#13;
increasing supply by bringing together various producing communities; (ii) strengthening&#13;
the managerial capacity of farmers marketing groups in such skills as management,&#13;
negotiations, legal aspects, and accounting; (iii) promoting farmers markets in regional and&#13;
subregional towns and cities, which is a proven way to increase prices to farmers if&#13;
appropriate access to the towns is available (as well as adequate roads to get to market);&#13;
and (iv) assisting provincial municipal markets, which are often an important bottleneck to&#13;
increasing flows of products to local and national markets.&#13;
14.   It is estimated 40 producer marketing groups would have been trained and another&#13;
100 formed; 90 farmers markets assisted and created; five subregional market centers&#13;
improved or built; and improved layout and operating plans would be developed for most of&#13;
the provincial markets, including improved administration. This would cost an estimated&#13;
$1.72 million, of which $81,000 would be utilized for technical assistance, and the rest for&#13;
investment sub-projects.&#13;
15.   Cottage Agroindustries. The objective is to increase value added at the local level,&#13;
increase farmers income, and promote improved links with the marketing channels.&#13;
Significant training is required for these projects as these tend to be more complex, dealing&#13;
with production, collection, processing, storing, and marketing of products. Criteria for&#13;
approval of these subprojects would therefore be more demanding. Specialized technical&#13;
assistance for management, technical aspects and marketing would most likely be required&#13;
as part of subproject financing. Previous successful experience would be an important asset.&#13;
Individual ownership, possibly a more successful form of management than community,&#13;
would be assisted as well, although not with purchased assets. The establishment of&#13;
agroindustries would be on a sub-regional or regional basis to avoid duplication.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX A&#13;
Page 5 of 18&#13;
16.   It is estimated 80 pre-investment studies would be completed ($2,000 each), 35&#13;
community level ones actually set up and running ($15,000 each), 6 regional agroindustries&#13;
(up to $100,000), and 6 small saw mills for the communities which have mature&#13;
reforestation schemes ($60,000 each), for a total cost of $ 1.96 million.&#13;
17.   Rural Roads Rehabilitafion. The objective is to improve roads to improve access&#13;
to social services, markets, and create employment. Given the generally low financial&#13;
viability of major rehabilitation of feeder roads for small rural communities, a system of&#13;
spot improvements would be utilized to eliminate bottlenecks and increase the average&#13;
speed at which vehicles can drive. These improvements include drainage, small bridges,&#13;
cover material improvement, and reducing slopes. The communities would be responsible&#13;
for maintenance through a "community road worker" who would eliminate smaller&#13;
problems such as pot holes, drainage problems, etc.&#13;
18.   Approximately 400 kms. would be rehabilitated, which represents about 30% of&#13;
feeder roads in the project area. Funds for this sub-component would be provided by the&#13;
FUSARD, but actually implemented by the FES which has considerable experience in this&#13;
field. The indicative estimate is $5.8 million, including $162,000 for the FES's supervisory&#13;
role, and the rest for subproject implementation.&#13;

RURAL POVERTY AND NATURAL RESOURCES PROJECT&#13;
Fund for Sustainable Agricultural and Rural Development&#13;
(FUISARD)&#13;
1.    The Fund for Sustainable Agricultural and Rural Development (FUSARD) would be&#13;
the mechanism responsible for financing-on a matching grant basis-rural development&#13;
activities and investments subprojects. FUSARD would be a financial intermediary,&#13;
involved with different levels of responsibility in subproject selection, appraisal, approval,&#13;
implementation, disbursement, technical follow-up, monitoring, and evaluation. It would be&#13;
located in the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) under the Rural Development Department.&#13;
On Government's request, to increase agility in the use of project resources, the funds&#13;
would be controlled by an external administrative agent such as UNDP or IICA (see Figure&#13;
1).&#13;
2.    FUSARD would have a Board composed of six Directors, representing MIDA,&#13;
MIPPE, and INRENARE, the NGO's, the municipalities and the communities. This Board&#13;
would approve the FUSARD Operational Manual and meet a on a regular basis, to take&#13;
strategic decisions, and approve subprojects with total cost above US$20,000 (see Table 1),&#13;
but would not be involved in day-to-day decision making. The operational management of&#13;
FUSARD would be carried out by the PCU, whose Director would be responsible for the&#13;
funds' overall operation. A Fund Administrator would be hired for the day-to-day&#13;
operations, and would be responsible for its administration and operation.&#13;
3.    Eligibility criteria for subprojects are detailed in the Operational Manual, of which&#13;
a draft has already been discussed with different stakeholders, and are based on the&#13;
following principles: (i) focus on a specific geographical area (see Table 2) and target&#13;
group, which is defined as peasant families associated in communities or productive groups,&#13;
and with a limited access to resources and services; (ii) selection through participatory&#13;
demand-driven mechanisms; (iii) possibility to be managed by beneficiaries or the designated&#13;
executing agencies; and (iv) technical, economic, social, and environmental feasibility and&#13;
sustainability.&#13;

4.    FUSARD would finance subprojects up to a maximum total cost of US$ 100,000&#13;
each. The subprojects would be selected and prioritized according to participatory demand-&#13;
driven mechanisms carried out through committees at community, corregzmiento,&#13;
provincial, and national levels, according to the thresholds of Table 1. The FUSARD&#13;
administrator in the PCU will always be responsible that the approved subprojects respects&#13;
the rules established in the FUSARD Operational Manual. The SDC would combine the&#13;
Community Action Plans (CAP' s) and design a strategy at corregimiento level according to&#13;
pre- set budgetary limits (FUSARD indicative budgetary allocations by district are shown in&#13;
Table 3). With an equity objective, an annual limit of US$800 per beneficiary would be&#13;
enforced, subject to review over time considering overall FUSARD expenditure.&#13;

5.    The type of subprojects to be financed by FUSARD would concentrate on&#13;
productive investments with the objective of sustainable rural poverty alleviation. A list of&#13;
possible subprojects includes: (i) production support including basic infrastructure, such as&#13;
access/feeder road rehabilitation, bridges, small irrigation schemes, rural markets, and crop&#13;
storage structures; (ii) production technology, such as technical assistance and extension to&#13;
farmers, revolving funds, small agro and cottage industries, and selected farm inputs;&#13;
These allocations were calculated using a mathematical formula which estimates the needs&#13;
by district/corregimiento according to the following indicators and weights: population&#13;
30%, poverty 50%, and number of communities 20%. The total of $15.5 million is&#13;
indicative. In addition, INRENARE would have access to US$400,000 for subprojects in&#13;
the Biodiversity Conservation Component.&#13;

(iii) environmental investments, such as land improvement and drainage subprojects,&#13;
watershed management, agro-forestry, and eco-tourism; and (iv) institutional strengthening&#13;
for executing agencies and communities, and pre-investment studies2&#13;
6.    A measure characteristically used to ensure ownership is beneficiaries' participation&#13;
in subproject finance which they can contribute in labor, cash or kind, between 10 and 30&#13;
percent of the subproject costs (see Table 4). These differences in cofinancing contributions&#13;
have been designed as an incentive for environmental subprojects.&#13;

7.    Executing Agencies. FUSARD would have the possibility to channel financial&#13;
resources through Implementing Organizations (1Os), such as NGOs, cooperatives, farmer&#13;
associations, and, in case of need, Government agencies. The 10 must meet FUSARD&#13;
eligibility criteria detailed in the Operational Manual which include technical and financial&#13;
capabilities and experience with the beneficiary community and region. The 10 can be a&#13;
public or private institution, with legal status, capable of implementing investment&#13;
subprojects. The 10 would accompany local communities through the Participatory&#13;
Microplanning process, and from project conceptualization to implementation (see below).&#13;
IOs would help the communities identify and rank investment needs, formulate Community&#13;
Action Plans and present the investment needs to the appropriate funding agencies for&#13;
consideration. IOs would be primarily drawn from local NGOs and producer organizations.&#13;
2     When the pre-investment studies themselves are sufficiently complex to be treated as&#13;
subprojects.&#13;

8.    Participatory Microplanning. This is a process designed to seek the active&#13;
participation of the rural population in planning, design, negotiation, execution and&#13;
supervision of rural investments. Participatory Microplanning is designed to facilitate&#13;
community and grassroots organizations to be effective players in their own development.&#13;
The objectives of this planning process are to: (i) contribute to the decentralization of&#13;
decision-making; (ii) stimulate grassroots participation in local planning and demand&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

generation; (iii) help rural communities formulate investment strategies and development&#13;
plans; and (iv) increase investment sustainability by intensifying stakeholders' commitment in&#13;
the execution and supervision of rural investments.&#13;
9.    The Participatory Microplanning methodology has been developed drawing on the&#13;
practical experiences in various countries, and has benefited from the procedures developed&#13;
by the Bolivian Fondo de Desarrollo Campesino, the Latin American Faculty for Social&#13;
Sciences, and the GTZ's Goal-Oriented Project Planning (ZOPP). It consists of the&#13;
organization of community and district workshops over the course of several weeks. At the&#13;
workshops, project field promoters and Executing Agencies help the communities formulate&#13;
a development strategy, by applying methods of groups dynamics. Workshop participants&#13;
are community delegates (two people, a woman and a man), representatives from&#13;
development organizations, and interested individuals. After each workshop, time is allotted&#13;
for the community delegates to return and inform the community of the workshops&#13;
proceedings, and receive community feedback. As some communities decisions are taken&#13;
by consensus, this process can be lengthy. The duration and cost of this process are&#13;
variable and depend on: (i) maturity of the local organizations; (ii) homogeneity of the&#13;
rural communities; (iii) time availability of community members, which is a function of&#13;
interest, cropping seasons and employment patterns; and (iv) IO capabilities and&#13;
commitment.&#13;
10.   The Participatory Microplanning would be carried out at community and&#13;
corregimiento levels and has seven stages:&#13;
(a) Preparatory phase. Project staff would participate in the training of NGOs and other&#13;
executing agencies to explain its programs and procedures detailed in the Operational&#13;
Manual;&#13;
(b) Promotion. The NGOs would disseminate FUSARD purposes and methodology and in&#13;
particular: (i) the eligibility criteria for subprojects; (ii) the processing steps for eligible&#13;
subprojects identified in their corresponding action plans, including sample&#13;
documentation and approximate times of processing, and (iii) execution and supervision&#13;
mechanisms applied by FUSARD;&#13;
(c) Constitution of the Sustainable Development Committee at community and&#13;
corregimiento levels;&#13;
(d) Self diagnostic to help the communities better perceive their economic and social&#13;
strengths and weaknesses with a view to formulating achievable socio-economic goals.&#13;
Participatory rural appraisal techniques-such as participatory mapping and seasonal&#13;
calendars-are used to assist the community in the identification of constraints, causes&#13;
and solutions;&#13;
(e) Preparation of a Community (CAP) Action Plan, which is a ranked list of subprojects&#13;
screened according to development strategy, requirements, technical feasibility, and&#13;
funds availability or potential suitability for funding (from FUSARD or other sources);&#13;
(f) Plan adjustment; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Appendix I&#13;
(g) Subproject formulation to transform subproject ideas into financiable proposals.&#13;
11.   The participatory rural appraisal techniques and tools would include, among others:&#13;
(i) interviews, whose flexible agendas permit the participants guided discussion topics;&#13;
(ii) participatory mapping exercises, which positions socio-economic information on a map,&#13;
creates consensus and facilitates communications; (iii) seasonal calendar, showing rainfall&#13;
patterns, crop sequencing, seasonal labor demand and availability; (iv) historical profiles and&#13;
time trends, concerning changes in social organization, income opportunities and natural&#13;
resource use; and (v) short, simple questionnaires, concerning socio-economnic situation to&#13;
be completed by the whole community before the following workshop.&#13;
12.   The subproject preparation consists of three stages:&#13;
(a) Subproject Profile/Idea. This is a first description of the subproject, its rationale and an&#13;
approximation of its cost;&#13;
(b) Subproject Proposal. It is an economic, social, environmental, and financial evaluation&#13;
of the subproject, with a detailed estimation of its costs. The format of the Proposal is&#13;
suitable for presentation to funding agencies; and&#13;
(c) Subproject Design. It is a detailed technical description of the subproject. The Design is&#13;
necessary only for technically complex subprojects, such as agroindustries or irrigation&#13;
systems.&#13;
The preparation of subproject profiles begins in parallel with the preparation of the action&#13;
plan, as the ranking process requires an approximation of the costs and feasibility of various&#13;
subproject options. The final development contains a profile for every proposed subproject.&#13;

coordinating with neighboring communities, with the possibility of consolidating projects&#13;
(e.g. watershed management, agroindustries, nurseries), the processing procedures for&#13;
eligible subprojects would consist of the following phases: promotion, identification,&#13;
preparation, appraisal, approval, execution, monitoring, acceptance of works (for&#13;
infrastructure projects), and ex post evaluation:&#13;
(a) Identification. FUSARD processes subprojects originating from: (i) district or&#13;
community action plans; and (iii) eligible executing agencies. All proposals should&#13;
demonstrate community participation and consensus in the prioritization and&#13;
identification of the subprojects.&#13;
(b) Formulation. The primary responsibility for subproject formulation lies with the&#13;
executing agency and project field staff The preparation process may take one of three&#13;
possible courses: (i) the subproject profile is duly prepared according to FUSARD&#13;
requirements and guidelines and requires no further work prior to appraisal by&#13;
FUSARD; (ii) the subproject profile complies with general eligibility criteria but requires&#13;
a feasibility study; this study would usually be financed under the Sustainable Rural&#13;
Development Component; and (iii) the subproject profile does not meet eligibility&#13;
criteria, requiring the executing agency to redesign it with guidance from FUSARD.&#13;
(c) Appraisal. FUSARD, supported by project specialists, appraises the subproject,&#13;
including discrepancies between proposed unit costs and standard costs by project&#13;
category. Subproject appraisal takes into account the subproject's prioritization&#13;
process, cost-effectiveness, poverty focus, and sustainability. In addition, the&#13;
institutional capacity of the executing agency is evaluated. FUSARD also evaluates the&#13;
significance of the counterpart contribution. Approval criteria includes analysis of&#13;
alternatives, social impact and multiplier effect. Some subprojects require an&#13;
environmental analysis (see below). Any subproject deemed unfeasible on appraisal may&#13;
be rejected. The executing agency may then consider redesigning the subproject and&#13;
submit it again to FUSARD.&#13;
(d) Approval. Subprojects are approved according to thresholds set in Table 1. Approved&#13;
subprojects are then included in FUSARD annual operating plan. When funding is&#13;
approved, FUSARD and the requesting agency (or community, if provided with legal&#13;
status) enter into a contract. For some kind of subprojects, when a contractor is&#13;
required (such as for infrastructure subprojects), the contract would also involve the&#13;
contractor.&#13;
(e) Execution. The responsibility for subproject implementation lies with the executing&#13;
agency. Subproject implementation rules include: (a) FUSARD signs a contract with&#13;
the executing agency, in which the executing agency commit itself to follow FUSARD&#13;
procurement procedures; (b) the target community approves the hiring of external&#13;
consultants/sub-contractors by the executing agency; (c) where applicable, the executing&#13;
agency would enter into a contract with the construction contractor or supplier of&#13;
goods or services; and (d) the executing agency would ensure proper subproject&#13;
supervision as per its contractual obligations in (a).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX A&#13;
Page 15 of 18&#13;
Appendix 1&#13;
(f) Disbursement. Disbursements would be made against the contract signed between&#13;
FUSARD and the executing agency. Full disbursements could be done in advance only&#13;
in the case of small subprojects, while in other cases the disbursement would be divided&#13;
in tranches.&#13;
(g) Subproject supervision and technical follow-up. Responsibilities for these activities are&#13;
divided among beneficiaries and field personnel under the MIDA Department of Rural&#13;
Development. Participatory supervision and social monitoring are the pillar of the&#13;
FUSARD approach. However, given the difficult technical aspects in some subprojects&#13;
(e.g. agroindustries), the involvement of technically prepared professionals would be&#13;
essential. For the agricultural and marketing subprojects, MIDA has a major&#13;
comparative advantage over other institutions in Panama: more than half of his 2,500&#13;
staff are based outside Panama city, in provincial and district offices composed of multi-&#13;
disciplinary teams. In some cases, additional contracts between an independent&#13;
supervisor and FUSARD might be required.&#13;
(h) Monitoring. The monitoring of the subproject is shared by the executing agency, the&#13;
target community, and FUSARD staff, in a pre-determined written arrangement. All&#13;
three parties issue an approval and formal certification of due and proper project&#13;
subproject performance. FUSARD has a planning, monitoring, and evaluation system&#13;
detailing the specific instruments and the responsibilities. The long term objective of&#13;
FUSARD is to emphasize ex-post monitoring, though at the beginning a more intense&#13;
follow up would be necessary. A list of monitoring indicators is in Annex F.&#13;
(i) Operation, Maintenance and Ex-post Evaluation. The target community holds the&#13;
primary responsibility for subproject operation. However, the executing agency would&#13;
maintain a presence throughout this phase to ensure due and proper subproject&#13;
operation, the provision of technical assistance services if required, maintenance and ex-&#13;
post evaluation.&#13;
Environmental Impact and Mitigation Measures&#13;
14.   The project would contribute to the implementation of various kinds of subprojects,&#13;
some with possible negative impact on the environment and others with clear positive&#13;
impact. The rehabilitation of rural infrastructure such as access roads, small scale irrigation&#13;
works, processing and market facilities, etc. could create localized environmental problems.&#13;
Subprojects of integrated watershed management, reforestation, pasture management, etc.,&#13;
would generate a positive environmental impact. The training and capacity-building&#13;
components would include sustainable natural resource management, thus generating long-&#13;
term benefits for the environment.&#13;
15.   Environmental aspects of all subprojects would be reviewed during feasibility studies&#13;
and, when appropriate, mitigating measures would be designed for implementation. IOs&#13;
would prepare an environmental description of every infrastructure and production support&#13;
subproject. This information would be reviewed by INRENARE, which would be&#13;
responsible for the screening and which would assign the subproject to one of the following&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX A&#13;
Page 16 of 18&#13;
Appendix I&#13;
categories: (i) full environment assessment required; (ii) specific environment assessment&#13;
required; (iii) although an environment assessment is not required, environmental analysis is&#13;
suggested; and (iv) no environment assessment or environmental analysis required. Besides,&#13;
subproject identification and preparation through the participatory community-planning&#13;
process would help avert negative impact on human and social environment.&#13;
16.   Access Road Rehabilitation. FUSARD would finance only rehabilitation and spot&#13;
improvement of existing roads. A simplified environmental analysis would carried out for&#13;
each subproject of this kind as the roads are already in existence. This analysis would take&#13;
into account not only the disturbance to natural environment caused by soil erosion,&#13;
changes to stream and underground water, interference with animal life, deforestation on&#13;
the road blade, but also the increases in agricultural production. These consequences are&#13;
inherent with agricultural growth and intensification. Access roads would not be&#13;
rehabilitated in forest reserves and other environmentally sensitive areas or where they&#13;
would encourage settlement.&#13;

17.   Small Scale Irrigation. As only small-scale irrigation would be introduced, the&#13;
subproject would not have a significant environmental impact. However, some problems,&#13;
such as water quality degradation because of chemicals used in the more intensive irrigated&#13;
agriculture, might occur at the local level. In Table 5 the likelihood of occurrence and&#13;
eventual mitigation measures are highlighted.&#13;

of subprojects are mainly health and sanitation related: water supply, refuse collection,&#13;
sewerage, and clean-up facilities. Poor hygiene and lack of water supply can turn out into&#13;
food contamination and health hazards. Some kind of processing, such as cheese&#13;
processing, could produce polluting sewerage, while others, such as brick production, might&#13;
cause borrow-pits. In all these cases, appropriate mitigation measures would be a condition&#13;
of financing the project.&#13;

RURAL POVERTY AND NATURAL RESOURCE PROJECT&#13;
Biodiversity Conservation Comnonent&#13;
I. BACKGROUND&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The proposed, integrated Rural Poverty and Natural Resources/Biodiversity&#13;
Conservation Program (IBRD/GEF) deals with the root causes leading to migration to the&#13;
agricultural frontier and invasion of public forests and protected areas while enhancing on-&#13;
site protection of areas with biodiversity values of regional and global importance,&#13;
assisting local and national government and communities to internalize the costs of natural&#13;
resource degradation and biodiversity loss, and improving the conservation and&#13;
management of biodiversity inside and outside of protected areas. The program includes&#13;
two associated components whose objectives are: (i) to pilot methodologies that direct&#13;
resources for investment and technical assistance towards priority areas of rural poverty&#13;
and natural resource degradation in order to reduce their incidence and outmigration; and&#13;
(ii) to conserve priority biodiversity in areas of global, regional and national interest.&#13;
2.    THE second component is still under preparation to meet the Global Environmental&#13;
Facility's priorities to provide a grant to finance the incremental costs of protecting the&#13;
National Biological Corridor. Although conceptually and administratively part of the&#13;
same project, the GEF grant, which would co-finance with Government and communities&#13;
the Panamanian portion of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (herein called the&#13;
Atlantic Biological Corridor), would be managed as a separate financial operation, with&#13;
different timing, documentation, legal agreements and supervision reports. The GEF&#13;
activities are still under preparation and subject to GEF council approval; the GEF-&#13;
supported components are expected to be submitted for Board approval in the second half&#13;
of calendar 1997, and if approved, implementation could start about four months after the&#13;
IBRD loan is effective. The description presented below of the Corridor related activities&#13;
is preliminary and could be changed during the on-going preparation of the relevant&#13;
subcomponents.&#13;
Biodiversity and Threats in Panama&#13;
3.    Biodiversity In Panama. The Isthmus of Panama is the terrestrial bridge which&#13;
has united the continental masses of North and South America and separated the waters of&#13;
the Pacific and Atlantic oceans since the Pleistocene. These and other biogeographic and&#13;
climatic factors combine to make Panama a high biodiversity country. The other factors&#13;
include: Panama's location at the juncture of the Caribbean, Northern Andean, and&#13;
Central American bioregions; its narrow mass between two oceans and sharp attitudinal&#13;
gradients compressing life zones and causing rapid changes within and between habitat-&#13;
types; and the influences of the strong climatic gradients created by the Trade Winds&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

encountering the central cordillera. These factors create the multiple habitats and&#13;
microhabitats which greatly enhance this small country's (75,517km2 ) biological diversity&#13;
and importance. The former Canal Zone, which transects the country along the types of&#13;
gradient described here, represents the only location in the Americas where an inter-&#13;
oceanic biological corridor is still practically uninterrupted.&#13;
4.    From a conservation perspective, a recent study identifies Panama' as the one&#13;
country in the Central American Isthmus with areas of globally important Tropical Moist&#13;
Broadleaf Forest (Choc6/Darien moist forests). It places these forests in "highest" priority&#13;
category in Latin America for biodiversity conservation. This study also notes that the&#13;
Tropical Moist Broadleaf Forests of the Talamancan mountain range and the mangroves&#13;
of Bocas del Toro/Bastimentos Island/San Blas are considered to be "high" priority for&#13;
biodiversity conservation. Indeed, two-thirds of the Panama falls either into the "highest"&#13;
or "high" priority category.&#13;
5.    Three major habitat types are found within Panama: (i) Tropical Moist Broadleaf&#13;
Forests; (ii) Tropical Dry Broadleaf Forests, and (iii) Mangroves. There are 12 confirmed&#13;
Holdridge Life Zones 2. The existence of a 13th, Subalpine Wet Paramo, awaits&#13;
confirmation. A total of 24 distinct landscape units are recognized, within which a&#13;
considerable number of endemic species are found. In terms of species diversity among&#13;
mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians, Panama is first among the countries of Central&#13;
America and the Caribbean; and in terms of vascular seed plants it is second only to Costa&#13;
Rica (Winogad, 1995).&#13;
6.     Aside from biodiversity values, Panama's forest areas are also of incalculable&#13;
economic importance to North, Meso-, and South America. The so-far inaccessible and&#13;
untransversed forests of the Darien have served as an effective biological barrier to the&#13;
interchange of economically important crop and livestock pests and diseases (e.g., foot&#13;
and mouth disease). In addition, one-half of the Panama Canal's watershed is protected&#13;
by national parks, an act of conservation which protects the water supply of a $400 million&#13;
per year operation (shipping fees and Canal related services) of tremendous global&#13;
economic importance.&#13;

aside 23% of the national territory to form the National Protected Area System (NAPAS)&#13;
as shown in Tables 1 and 2. A review of the conservation status of the life zones&#13;
represented in the NAPAS shows:&#13;
* There is relatively little which is intact within the tropical dry forest zones, and&#13;
premontane dry forest (being zones traditionally favored for human settlement);&#13;
* Significant areas of humid tropical forest, premontane wet forest, premontane rain&#13;
forest, lower montane wet forest, lower montane rain forest, and montane rain forest&#13;
remain, which have been little altered;&#13;
* Some small areas of montane rain forest remain unaltered;&#13;
*  The conservation status of premontane moist forest, lower montane moist forest and&#13;
montane wet forest is uncertain, as well as subalpine wet paramo, which is in fact&#13;
unconfirmed.&#13;

8.     Within the above areas, there are yet some outstanding examples of relatively&#13;
intact and healthy areas of global and regional biodiversity importance. Areas of note&#13;
include: (i) the Darien region's lowland rainforests, riverine systems -- including the&#13;
country's largest river system (Tuira River), wetlands and coastal areas; (ii) the Province&#13;
of Bocas Del Toro whose archipelagos have been described as the "Galapagos Islands" of&#13;
the next century due to their geologic history and current conservation status; significant&#13;
elements of primary humid and wet tropical, Premontane and montane forests, inland&#13;
marshes and coastal wetlands, healthy coral formations and transient populations of&#13;
manatee and green turtles yet exist; (iii) the Talamanca Range, crossing the border&#13;
between Panama and Costa Rica, which is estimated to be the region of highest&#13;
biodiversity on the Central American isthmus (source: WWF, 1991); an area of extremely&#13;
high endemism, it encompasses the largest complex of protected areas within one&#13;
bioregion in Central America (La Amistad International Park) and it is one of the most&#13;
diverse, virtually intact ecosystems in Central America encompassing a variety of habitats&#13;
including lowland rainforest, cloud forest, subalpine plains, high marshes and glacial&#13;
vestiges.&#13;
9.      These areas are all included in the Panamanian Atlantic portion of the Meso-&#13;
American Biodiversity Corridor, a regional project which aims at conserving a series of&#13;
high biodiversity areas of global importance extending from Southern Mexico to Northern&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Colombia, thus providing a critical biological link between the continental masses of North&#13;
and South America. UNDP is now finalizing a Central American study to refine the&#13;
definition and priorities of the MBC. In Honduras the World Bank and UNDP are&#13;
collaborating in the preparation of the GEF/IDA Biodiversity Conservation Project which&#13;
supports Honduras' contribution to the MBC; in Nicaragua the GEF/IDA Atlantic&#13;
Biodiversity Corridor project is under preparation to support Nicaragua's contribution to&#13;
the MBC. In Costa Rica the protected areas system has recently been restructured with&#13;
explicit "biological corridor" objectives. GEF is also supporting projects, through UNDP,&#13;
in Guatemala and Costa Rica.&#13;
10.   Threats to Biodiversity. Threats to these ecosystems comes from diverse&#13;
anthropogenic influences. The first is reflected in the advance of the agricultural frontier.&#13;
The existence of the rich biodiversity described above contrasts sharply with the land use&#13;
situation. Over half of the forests of Panama have disappeared and deforestation rates are&#13;
estimated to be in the order of 50,000 ha/yr. The causes of deforestation and land&#13;
degradation are in no way unique to Panama and their roots are to be found, among&#13;
others, in extreme poverty (a highly rural phenomena in Panama), lack of economic&#13;
opportunity in the rural zones, and government policies that in the past have favored urban&#13;
over rural zones and larger-scale, export-oriented agriculture (e.g., livestock) to the&#13;
exclusion of more balanced resource management. Soil degradation and the lack of viable&#13;
economic resource management alternatives in the traditional agricultural zones&#13;
continually propel the rural poor outward in search of new lands at the agricultural&#13;
frontier. In most cases, those frontiers have or are rapidly closing in on the country's&#13;
forests and protected areas. With both the population of poor and the percentage living in&#13;
poverty increasing, so apparently are invasions of protected areas. Increased ease of&#13;
access into the Darien region has in recent years further fueled this phenomena.&#13;
11.   Other threats to biodiversity include (i) new road projects, which, under frontier&#13;
conditions, would offer improved access into unprotected, intact ecosystems of the&#13;
Atlantic; (ii) mining in the Cordillera Central of Panama, which is included in the Atlantic&#13;
corridor, and which is considered to be one of the last major unexplored porphyry copper-&#13;
gold belts in the world; (iii) native forest exploitation through extraction permits given to&#13;
individuals or community groups and logging concessions; (iv) wildlife-habitat&#13;
conversion, fragmentation and hunting; and (v) contamination of fresh and coastal waters&#13;
from non-point source pollution from agriculture, rural processing facilities, urban&#13;
wastewater, petroleum wastes and spills in the canal and the cross-country pipelines.&#13;
12.   GOP Strategy to Manage Threats to Biodiversity. In spite of these threats,&#13;
Panama has been more successful than most other Central American countries in&#13;
preserving biodiversity and an almost uninterrupted corridor of yet relatively intact&#13;
ecosystems along the Atlantic coast and inland defacto exists. Three of the most&#13;
important biodiversity areas of the country discussed above, the Dari6n, Bocas del Toro&#13;
and the Talamanca range, are outstanding examples of relatively intact and healthy areas&#13;
included in the corridor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX B&#13;
Page 7 of 20&#13;
13.   Panama's successes in preserving the Atlantic coast and its most important&#13;
biodiversity in spite of the serious threats stem from a combination of national policies and&#13;
projects, namely: (i) a services based economy that was able to absorb considerable&#13;
surplus labor from rural areas into the Panama City, which contains today about half of the&#13;
Panamanian population; (ii) the inaccessibility of most of the Atlantic coast due to the&#13;
non-existence or poor state of roads and which helps reduce migratory and logging&#13;
pressures since economic activities have low profitability; (iii) protected areas that for the&#13;
most part are not "paper" parks and count with a minimum administrative presence,&#13;
including the Darien, Bocas del Toro and the Talamanca Range; (iv) the Kuna reserve&#13;
which is a world recognized success in giving indigenous communities (the Kunas) full&#13;
territorial and natural resource rights and which has been protected by the Kunas from&#13;
potential threats; (v) the Panama Canal watershed which protects the water supply of a&#13;
$400 million per year operation of tremendous global economic importance and where&#13;
GOP and donors have invested considerable resources for protection; (vi) pro-&#13;
biodiversity national legislation including the legislation creating the National Protected&#13;
Area System (1994), the Forestry Law (1994), the Environmental Impact Assessment-&#13;
Environmental Framework Law (1994) and the Wildlife Law (1995) and adherence to&#13;
international treaties (see below); and (vii) several on-going conservation and sustainable&#13;
development projects that directly or indirectly contribute to biodiversity conservation&#13;
including the GEF/UNDP project focused on the Darien buffer zone, the USAID-&#13;
PRONATURA fund for the Panama Canal watershed, two buffer zone IFAD projects, and&#13;
ITTO forest management project, and others discussed above, all within the biodiversity&#13;
corridor.&#13;
14.   Role of Proposed Project in Reducing Threats to Biodiversity. Today,&#13;
however, there is a perception that some of the threats are becoming more serious and that&#13;
unless incremental interventions are put in place global biodiversity will suffer from the&#13;
degradation of important sites and the breaking of important portions of the corridor.&#13;
These increased threats include the asphalting of a road into the Darien area, a new road&#13;
planned for the Bocas del Toro region, increased outmigration due to a crisis of the rural&#13;
economy in the Pacific, and the threats from an expansion of the mining activity. To&#13;
mitigate these threats the government has devised a three-pronged strategy that aims at&#13;
(i) reducing the push and (ii) pull factors underlying the advance of the agricultural&#13;
frontier; and (iii) minimizing the threats from on-going economic activities in the Atlantic.&#13;
15.   The proposed project is an integral part of this strategy. The project focuses one&#13;
set of instruments on the poorer and more populous southern provinces of the Pacific to&#13;
reduce outmigration from poverty and resource degradation leading to migration that&#13;
pushes the agricultural frontier and leads to subsequent invasions of public forests and&#13;
protected areas; and another set within the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor, closing&#13;
access to high biodiversity areas thus reducing the pull factors and controlling in situ&#13;
threats to biodiversity. This would be accomplished by (i) investing heavily in areas of&#13;
origin of poor migrants; (ii) improving protection of protected areas; (iii) helping&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

indigenous and non-indigenous dwellers of the Atlantic coast to protect their community&#13;
lands from external threats and assisting them with biodiversity conservation activities,&#13;
(iv) enlisting local governments in the Atlantic behind the principles of the corridor,&#13;
(v) ensuring that planned public development projects such as roads appropriately&#13;
internalize the corridor concept and include mitigating measures; (v) building partnerships&#13;
with mining interests in the Atlantic to involve them in biodiversity management activities;&#13;
and (vi) helping coordinate other on-going projects and ensuring that all contribute&#13;
coherently to the objectives of the corridor.&#13;
H. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION&#13;
16.   The Rural Poverty and Natural Resources Project has been developed to provide&#13;
the Government of Panama with a coherent, multi-sectoral response to the interrelated&#13;
issues of rural poverty, natural resources management, and biodiversity conservation. The&#13;
rural development component focuses on the poorer and more populous southern&#13;
provinces of the Pacific where root causes of poverty and resource degradation lead to&#13;
migration to the agricultural frontier and subsequent invasions of public forests and&#13;
protected areas. The Biodiversity Conservation Component is described below.&#13;
17.   The principle objectives of the project are described in Chapter 2 of the main text. To&#13;
meet these goals the project would have three closely related components:&#13;
(a) Sustainable Rural Development (See para. 2.12, and Annex A).&#13;
(b) Biodiversity Conservation. Implemented by the Institute for Renewable Natural&#13;
Resources (INRENARE) and NGOs, this component would include two subcomponents:&#13;
(a) Pacific Zone Protected Area Management; and (b) Panama Atlantic Biological&#13;
Corridor, including (i) biodiversity information and planning from the Atlantic Biodiversity&#13;
Corridor, including base studies, community, municipal, provincial land use planning,&#13;
monitoring and environmental impact assessment; (ii) capacity building for relevant actors&#13;
in biodiversity conservation and sustainable use including modernization of protected areas&#13;
management; and (iii) Atlantic Biodiversity Investment Program, which would cover&#13;
support to government biodiversity subprojects and protected area management activities&#13;
that contribute to biodiversity conservation and sustainable use within the framework of the&#13;
biological corridor; including protected areas delimitation and infrastructure and&#13;
environmental projects in the buffer and biodiversity corridor zones, such as ecotouristic&#13;
activities that would generate income for the neighboring communities, as well as the PA&#13;
system. These actions would be carried out in the context of the Mesoamerican Biological&#13;
Corridor and their incremental costs are expected to be funded by the Global&#13;
Environmental Facility (GEF).&#13;
(c) Project Coordination. (See para. 2.14 and Annex C).&#13;

Detailed Description of the Biodiversity Conservation Component&#13;
18.   INRENARE, as part of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor study assisted by&#13;
GEF/UNDP, has recently completed its study "Panama: National Protected Areas&#13;
and Biological Corridor Plan ". This study provides an approximate delineation of the&#13;
biological corridor and a diagnostic of the issues relevant to its conservation, including a&#13;
diagnosis of potential gaps in the current National Protected Areas System. Previous&#13;
work under the preparation of the Rural Poverty and Natural Resources project completed&#13;
a detailed diagnostic of the National Protected Areas System. The perspective of the&#13;
latter is on improving NAPAS management, prioritizing activities within NAPAS based on&#13;
conservation status and adequacy of management, identifying operational gaps and&#13;
weaknesses in the management of the priority protected areas and minimum necessary&#13;
investments to attend to the gaps and weaknesses. Further preparation is required to&#13;
complete what would be the proposal for Panama's contribution to the Mesoamerican&#13;
Biological Corridor. This includes preparing the overall corridor strategy, review of the&#13;
proposed protected area investments in light of the strategy, preparation of the non-&#13;
protected area corridor investments, and ongoing participation and consultation processes&#13;
with stakeholders to ensure proper design.&#13;
19.   The corridor strategy would cover those areas of the country where a de facto&#13;
corridor still exists - within the Atlantic watershed and along the borders with Costa Rica&#13;
and Colombia. The proposal being developed includes a preliminary strategic definition of&#13;
feasible land uses that draw on the natural strengths conferred by the legal, conceptual or&#13;
physical existence of such features as protected areas, buffer zones, indigenous territories,&#13;
forest lands, critical municipal watersheds, wetlands, and economic development activities.&#13;
The final product would be a first approximation of an Environment and Land Use Plan&#13;
for the corridor. Secondly, from this plan priority corridor elements would be defined&#13;
where: (i) coordination with existing efforts and donors is essential; and (ii) defined types&#13;
of subprojects would be promoted and financed to support initiatives consistent with the&#13;
maintaining corridor integrity and biodiversity conservation. The Environmental Plan,&#13;
combined with outputs from the targeted social assessment, finalized Indigenous Peoples&#13;
Development Plan (Annex D), and additional stakeholder consultations, would provide the&#13;
basis for developing the broader strategy for the promotion and negotiation of the corridor&#13;
in its entirety. Thirdly, the proposal will define the capacity building investments required&#13;
to support both the specific subprojects and the broader corridor promotion. Fourth, it&#13;
will define the processes to be implemented during the project life to harmonize the&#13;
definition of the corridor with local, provincial and national interests, including ensuring&#13;
the evolution of the corridor strategy consistent with lessons being learned.&#13;
20.   Some aspects of this component are still under preparation to meet the Global&#13;
Environmental Facility's (GEF) priorities. IBRD and GOP would finance INRENARE&#13;
strengthening and the investments in the protected areas outside the Atlantic Biological&#13;
Corridor, which total US$2.2 million. The preparation of these latter investments has been&#13;
finalized and would be included for financing by the IBRD loan. The full component, divided&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX B&#13;
Page 10 of 20&#13;
into three areas of action described below, would be implemented by INRENARE, NGOs and&#13;
other implementing organizations, under INRENARE supervision.&#13;
(a) Panama Atlantic Biological Corridor (PABC) Information and Planning (US$2.1&#13;
million; GEF tentatively US$1.5 million) would focus on filling in gaps in knowledge&#13;
critical to refining and negotiating the corridor framework with national and local level&#13;
actors would include: (i) Rapid Biodiversity Assessments (US$0.4 million; GEF tentatively&#13;
US$0.3 million) with biological, as well as economic and socio-cultural valuation, for&#13;
specific sites which are threatened by economic developments from mining, transport,&#13;
forestry, tourism, and fishing. The information generated would be essential to build&#13;
consensus around appropriate land uses to mitigate biodiversity loss of key sites and reduce&#13;
potential fragmentation of the corridor; (ii) Corridor Land Use Planning (US$0.6 million;&#13;
GEF tentatively US$0.4 million) for continued participatory planning of the corridor. The&#13;
PABC is perceived as a matrix of land uses agreed with key stakeholders at the local,&#13;
regional and national levels. Those agreements would be formalized through a series of&#13;
instruments, including participatory environmental land use planning, within which roles,&#13;
rights and responsibilities would be defined for local communities, NGOs, private sector,&#13;
and national and local government; (iii) Biodiversity Monitoring (US$0.6 million; GEF&#13;
tentatively US$0.5 million) for establishing a "minimum required" system for biodiversity&#13;
monitoring, which can detect changes in vegetative cover/land use, and population trends&#13;
of key indicator species, in order to more efficiently focus limited resources on threats to&#13;
the PABC. This system would be linked to both ongoing (e.g., standardized reporting by&#13;
park guards and field foresters) and ad hoc (e.g., Rapid Ecological Assessments, discussed&#13;
above, and biodiversity/ecological research) data collection mechanisms. This national&#13;
monitoring effort would be closely coordinated with a regional scheme for the MBC&#13;
supported by GEF/CCAD/UNDP; and (iv) Corridor Promotion and Information&#13;
Dissemination (US$0.5 million; GEF tentatively US$0.3 million) to ensure high visibility&#13;
for the corridor as a concept and a strategy for the integration of biodiversity concerns&#13;
within national, regional and local development. Activities would be focused both at the&#13;
general public as a means of creating public support for the corridor, as well as at key&#13;
stakeholders to create an incentive for their participation within planning processes,&#13;
partnerships and strategic alliances built around the conservation of key elements of the&#13;
corridor (e.g., indigenous lands, protected areas, primary forests, critical watersheds, etc.).&#13;
(b) Capacity Building For Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Use (US$2.2&#13;
million; GEF tentatively US$1.5 million) would focus on strengthening of government and&#13;
non-government organizations and communities for the conservation and sustainable use of&#13;
biodiversity resources in the PABC: (i) Training and Assistance to Government and Non-&#13;
government Organizations and Communities (US$1.7 million, GEF tentatively US$1.2&#13;
million) strengthening of key stakeholders through environmental education and selected&#13;
training and capacity building exercises in order to facilitate their assumption of&#13;
responsibilities in PABC corridor conservation and protection activities (e.g., in indigenous&#13;
lands, protected areas, primary forests, critical watersheds, coastal zones, etc.). Specific&#13;
programs would be targeted at (a) indigenous and non-indigenous communities in support&#13;
of pre-defined, eligible activities clearly related to the conservation and sustainable use of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

biodiversity; (b) NGOs, private sector, and local governments in support of the PABC&#13;
strategy; (c) central government (non-INRENARE) on incorporation of biodiversity and&#13;
corridor strategy into sectoral planning; and (d) human resource development for protected&#13;
areas administration and management, including private sector partners, NGOs and local&#13;
governments and communities. Specific efforts will be made during preparation to create&#13;
alliances within the mining sector to strengthen environmental oversight and integration of&#13;
biodiversity issues into mining practice through the private sector Mining Board and&#13;
promotion of "model" practices; (ii) Modernization of Protected Area Management&#13;
(US$0.5 million; GEF tentatively US$0.2 million) including upgrading of management&#13;
norms, assistance in development of decentralized and participatory management and&#13;
management planning systems, training of personnel, and development of a revenue capture&#13;
and financial management system for protected areas.&#13;
(c) Panama Atlantic Biological Corridor Investment Program (US$6.8 million; GEF&#13;
tentatively US$5.2 million) would provide grants to finance eligible costs of securing the&#13;
long term protection of the corridor and biodiversity, including equipment, consultants,&#13;
operational expenses, studies, workshops, training, study tours and development and&#13;
dissemination of materials: (i) Indigenous Lands (US$1.6 million; GEF tentatively US$1.3&#13;
million) would include assisting indigenous communities in critical areas of the corridor in&#13;
managing their lands in order to ensure their access to them and the biological resources&#13;
they contain, according to community needs and principles of sustainable use. In some&#13;
cases, activities may include assisting communities with regularization of land tenure and&#13;
resource user rights; (ii) Local Biodiversity Conservation and Management (US$2.0&#13;
million; GEF tentatively US$1.7 million) would support a grant program targeted at&#13;
incremental costs of biodiversity conservation and management activities in pre-defined,&#13;
high priority areas of the corridor, to be carried out by indigenous and non-indigenous&#13;
communities, NGOs, municipal governments and the private sector. In all cases, grants&#13;
would be conditional on explicit quidpro quo agreements that establish the responsibilities&#13;
of grant recipients as regards sustainable resource use. As a complement, the FUSARD&#13;
mechanism set up under the associated IBRD-financed project would provide US$2.9&#13;
million in financing for productive activities associated with poverty alleviation and&#13;
sustainable resource management along the agricultural frontier currently threatening to&#13;
break through into the PABC in northern Veraguas (Districts of Calobre, Cafiazas and&#13;
Santa Fe). The CAPS activities (community action plans) to be developed as the guide for&#13;
FUSARD investments, would support local corridor planning and would potentially&#13;
identify eligible subprojects for GEF grant financing. The Indigenous Peoples&#13;
Development Plan, being finalized under project preparation, where appropriate, would&#13;
also identify priorities to be financed; (iii) Protected Area Management (US$3.1 million;&#13;
GEF tentatively US$2.2 million) would include financing of the management of globally&#13;
important protected areas located within the PABC but which lack adequate protection and&#13;
management or that are potentially threatened by uncontrolled economic development&#13;
activities and lack the tools to respond. Three areas have been selected as priorities,&#13;
representing together, a range of ecosystems: (a) Darien, to build on the GEF-financed&#13;
project being implemented through UNDP; (b) Omar Torrijos-EI Cope, a key link in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

center of the PABC currently facing potential threats from mining and, within the medium&#13;
term, advance of the agricultural frontier; and (c) the altitudinal ecosystem complex&#13;
extending from La Amistad/Volcan Baru to the Isla Bastimentos/San San Pond Sak&#13;
covering a range of habitats from mountain ecosystems to coral reefs and seagrass&#13;
meadows. Eligible investments would include: demarcation, management plans;&#13;
infrastructure and equipment for protection, rudimentary research and visitor facilities; and&#13;
direct involvement of non-government actors including private sectors in administration,&#13;
management and protection.&#13;
(d) Project Management (US$4 million; GEF tentatively US$0.3 million) would contribute&#13;
toward financing the incremental costs of project administration, coordination, and&#13;
management related to GEF-financed activities.&#13;

Further Preparation of the Component&#13;
22.   A Block B grant has been requested by Government and approved by GEF to&#13;
cover further project preparation costs. During preparation, mechanisms for increasing&#13;
direct contributions from the private sector NGOs, local communities and beneficiaries&#13;
would be explored, as would the potential for cost recovery into local or national&#13;
biodiversity conservation revolving funds for certain investments. The following list of&#13;
studies include much of the future preparation work; they are detailed in the above grant&#13;
document:&#13;
*  Atlantic Biodiversity Corridor Planning;&#13;
*  Preparation of Monitoring and Biodiversity Assessment Activities;&#13;
*  Training Needs for Protected Areas,&#13;
*  Preparation on Non-protected Area Activities and Identification of Economic&#13;
Incentives;&#13;
*  Strategy for Managing Mining and Roads Threats;&#13;
*  Social Evaluation and Participation Strategy for Indigenous and Non-indigenous&#13;
peoples;&#13;
*  Analysis of Legal Framework for Indigenous Lands;&#13;
*  Incremental Cost Analysis;&#13;
*  Institutionalization of the PABC within INRENARE and the Protected Areas System;&#13;
-  Promotion and Dissemination of the MBC and PABC.&#13;
Institutional Framework and Project Implementation&#13;
23.   The Institute of Renewable Natural Resources (INRENARE) would be responsible&#13;
for the implementation of the component with its Department of Parks and Wildlife&#13;
(DPW) taking direct responsibility for the project's execution. These would receive&#13;
assistance from the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) which would manage disbursements&#13;
and procurement and channel funds to the project based on an approved annual work plan.&#13;
The PCU would also coordinate between agencies (INRENARE and MIDA) to assure&#13;
coherence in annual work plans and geographic and thematic focus, particularly as relates&#13;
to activities within and around protected areas and other critical elements of the biological&#13;
corridor. Implementation in the field would be mostly carried out by local organizations in&#13;
accordance with community and protected area action/management plans; a critical&#13;
element of which would be through stressing the formation of strategic partnerships&#13;
between the main stakeholders; such as formation of public/private park management&#13;
committees (committees involving local citizens, NGOs, and private sector in fund raising&#13;
and decisionmaking) for the management of biodiversity inside and outside protected&#13;
areas.&#13;

HI. RELATED ACTIVITIES&#13;
Parallel Projects&#13;
24.   Present efforts of note directly related to biodiversity conservation include: (i) the&#13;
Natural Resources Subcommittee in the Colombia-Panama Border Commission where&#13;
INRENARE (for Panama) and the Ministry of Environment (for Colombia) are working&#13;
on furthering exchange and scientific cooperation between the GEF-financed Bio-Darien&#13;
and Colombian Bio-Pacific projects; and (ii) the development of a national Biodiversity&#13;
Strategy, which is as yet in its initial stages, with assistance through UNEP.&#13;
25.   The parallel projects, which contribute directly or indirectly to biodiversity and the&#13;
Atlantic Biodiversity Corridor, include:&#13;
(a) Eastern Panama: (i) Sustainable Rural Development, Darien (IFAD): a six years&#13;
(1996-2002), US$14.3 million project for communities along the six main rivers in and&#13;
around the National Park.; (ii) Biodiversity Conservation, Darien (GEF/UNDP): a&#13;
five years (1994-99), US$2.5 million project with activities focused on the&#13;
identification of options for sustainable development which take into account&#13;
management and conservation of biodiversity inside and outside of protected areas,&#13;
involvement of indigenous communities, and supporting research and monitoring&#13;
activities; (iii) Community Management of Cativo Forest: a US$1.6 million project in&#13;
the provinces of Darien and Panama.&#13;
(b) North-Central Panama: (i) Natural Resource Management (Nature&#13;
Conservancy/USAID): a US$44 million project over seven years (1991-98) which has&#13;
established a US$25 million trust fund and foundation to assist INRENARE with&#13;
protected areas financing and financing of community-based natural resource&#13;
management focused primarily on the Canal Zone; (ii) The 'Triple-C' (IFAD): a&#13;
proposed project which would start in 1997 or 1998, with objectives similar to those&#13;
of the Sustainable Rural Development, Darien, with the inclusion of a central&#13;
objective on natural resource management and focused on the provinces of Cocle,&#13;
Col6n and Panama; (iii) Portobelo National Park project (SICA): a US$1.1 million&#13;
which is providing assistance to the national park and within its buffer zone;&#13;
(iv) Sustainable Forest Management Donoso District, Col6n (ITTO): a one year&#13;
project to develop forest management planning approaches for sustainable forest&#13;
management in the humid tropical zone of Panama.&#13;
(c) Western Panama: (i) Ngobe-Bugle (IFAD): a six year project (1994-2000), US$14.0&#13;
million project working with indigenous communities in sustainable livelihood and&#13;
rural development; (ii) Conservation for Sustainable Development (CATIE/OLAFO):&#13;
a three year (1993-95), US$0.7 million project focused on community and smallholder&#13;
resource management; (iii) Cooperative Agroforestry, Bocas Del Toro&#13;
(CATIE/GTZ): a four year (1995-98) US$0.35 million project; (iv) Ngobe,&#13;
Development of Forestry and Agroforestry Systems (GTZ): a four year (1992-95)&#13;
US$0.35 million project.&#13;

26.   The proposed IBRD/GEF projects would be a Panamanian contribution to the&#13;
integrated MesoAmerican Biodiversity Corridor (MBC). Ongoing projects alone would&#13;
be insufficient to bring about the conservation of the Atlantic Biodiversity Corridor which&#13;
covers 30% of the country, but with the complementary activities to be supported by the&#13;
proposed IBRD/GEF projects, the chances of success are optimistic.&#13;
Baseline Situation vs. GEF Alternative&#13;
27.   In terms of the Atlantic protected areas and their buffer zones within the areas&#13;
proposed under the Biodiversity Conservation Component, in 1996 a total of about&#13;
US$6.3 million (of which 80% was donor funding) was budgeted. The major financing&#13;
source is the Natural Resource Management project (USAID) accounting for over 60% of&#13;
1996 donor financing. Of these funds, about 60% went into the Panama Canal&#13;
watersheds, 17% into the Daridn, 8% to Portobelo National Park, 8% to the protected&#13;
area system in general, and the remaining 7% more or less equally to La Amistad and Isla&#13;
Bastimentos. For 1997, a very rough estimate of potential total financing (GOP and&#13;
donor) directly for natural resource management in what would be corridor areas outside&#13;
of protected areas and buffer zones would be US$1 million. This does not include the&#13;
1997 IFAD project financing of productive agricultural activities.&#13;
28.   While all these projects contribute to the biological corridor by promoting rational&#13;
land uses and resource management activities, alone they would not do the job. The role&#13;
of the IBRD/GEF project would be to cover existing gaps, of which the most important&#13;
ones are: (i) the need for a corridor planning and monitoring framework to guide public&#13;
investments; (ii) the need to involve a large number of public, private, NGO and&#13;
community stakeholders in the corridor concept; (iii) the need to enhance coordinating&#13;
mechanisms among the various initiatives; and (iv) the need to enhance biodiversity&#13;
conservation investments in areas of the corridor not well covered by the above projects.&#13;
These areas are (Table 1): (i) in the East: Darien, where there is already a GEF/UNDP&#13;
project, focused on community involvement primarily in the buffer zone, but where&#13;
additional resources are needed for activities inside the protected area; (ii) in the Central&#13;
Region West of Panama Canal: Omar Torrijos-El Cope; and (iii) in the Western Region:&#13;
La Amistad-Volcan Baru, Bastimentos and San San Pond Sak as detailed in Table 3.&#13;
Eligibility for GEF Grant&#13;
29.   Panama ratified the Convention for Biological Diversity on January 12, 1995. The&#13;
project is eligible for GEF funding under three of the four operational programs within the&#13;
Operational Strategy for Biodiversity: Mountain, Forest, and Coastal Wetlands, the&#13;
project would also strengthen protection of freshwater ecosystems. In accordance with&#13;
Article 8 of the Convention on Biological Diversity, the project focuses on in situ&#13;
conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in the Atlantic watershed and along&#13;
Panama's borders with Costa Rica and Colombia. It would protect biodiversity across a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX B&#13;
Page 16 of 20&#13;
diverse range of ecosystems and sharp altitudinal gradients encompassing tropical lowland&#13;
and montane tropical forests, coastal wetlands, reefs, and major riverine systems; including&#13;
the globally distinct Choc6/Darien moist forests, Bocas del Toro archipelagos, and areas&#13;
of the Talamanca Range with the highest levels of biodiversity on the Central American&#13;
isthmus.&#13;
30.   The participation of GEF within the project would be consistent with the First&#13;
Conference of the Parties (COP I and COP2) guidance as it: addresses in situ&#13;
conservation; includes institutional capacity building; strengthens conservation&#13;
management, and suitable use of ecosystems and habitats, including coastal and marine&#13;
ecosystems and mountain regions; strengthens the involvement of local and indigenous&#13;
peoples and integrates social dimensions, including those related to poverty. The proposed&#13;
GEF is also part of a larger GEF-supported strategy for an integrated Mesoamerican&#13;
Biological Corridor which is included in the GEF Operational Strategy. Other related&#13;
projects are currently under preparation with IDA and GEF support in Honduras and&#13;
Nicaragua; this project would complement those efforts in securing the integrity of the&#13;
Mesoamerican Biological Corridor.&#13;
31.   The project has been a priority on the national natural resource agenda for the last&#13;
five years, the development of which has included support from the Tropical Forestry&#13;
Action Plan process. Preliminary discussions on the National Biodiversity Strategy have&#13;
also noted the national contribution to the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MBC) as a&#13;
high priority. In 1994 Panama signed the Central American Alliance for Sustainable&#13;
Development which included objectives of guaranteeing the conservation of regional&#13;
biodiversity. The proposed project builds on UNDP/GEF-supported planning activities,&#13;
carried out by CCAD under a PDF Block B, to define the Mesoamerican Corridor and the&#13;
respective national contributions. The first phase of the UNDP Regional PDF has been&#13;
completed and has generated outputs of high relevance to the proposed project; these&#13;
include: (i) more precise definitions of the Panamanian biological corridor and planning&#13;
elements, to enrich the current national protected areas system plan; and (ii) an articulated&#13;
framework for compatibilizing national interests with regional priorities.&#13;
National Level Support&#13;
32.   The current government has an adopted policy of integrated development whose&#13;
elements include the promotion of social development within a context of economic&#13;
efficiency and support to those mechanisms which provide environmental oversight of&#13;
development and economic activities. Specific to biodiversity these latter are: (i) the 1994&#13;
resolution creating the National Protected Areas System and defining the norms,&#13;
regulations and management categories for its administration, (ii) the 1994 Forestry Law&#13;
providing the regulatory framework for the conservation of forests; and (iii) the 1995&#13;
Wildlife Law providing the regulatory framework for the conservation of wildlife. Bio-&#13;
logical corridors in Panama have been identified as priorities on the national natural&#13;
resource agenda for the past five years.&#13;

33.   Panama is a signatory to a number of regional and international agreements, in&#13;
addition to the Convention on Biological Diversity: RAMSAR (on wetlands), CMS&#13;
(international trade in migratory species), CITES (international trade in endangered&#13;
species), Central American Agreement for the Conservation of Biodiversity, and the&#13;
Central American Alliance for Sustainable Development; Panama is also a member of&#13;
IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of the Nature). Panama has participated&#13;
actively in the UNDP/GEF/CCAD regional corridor planning exercise, and the proposed&#13;
project would implement its major recommendations.&#13;

RURAL POVERTY AND NATURAL RESOURCES PROJECT&#13;
Biodiversity Conservation Component&#13;
Activity: Land Titline&#13;
1.    The purpose of this activity is to regularize land tenure of private properties that&#13;
adjoin the protected areas (PA) as a means to better define the PA's limits, rather than rely&#13;
only on demarcation from within the PA. Thus, it would title only those properties that&#13;
directly touch the PA - perimeter titling. Properties inside would be dealt with differently:&#13;
they wouldn't be titled, but rather the settlers would, through a negotiated process with&#13;
INRENARE, enter into an agreement which would define permitted activities and area of&#13;
action. No resettling would occur as Government has a stated policy against it. Rather,&#13;
through concession to use of the land, the settler would be enlisted to help protect the PA&#13;
from further encroachment. This appendix describes only the land titling process which&#13;
would be coordinated by MIDA's National Land Reform Office (Direcci6n Nacional de&#13;
Reforma Agraria) and INRENARE.&#13;
2.    Field Surveys. Field work would be carried out through the hiring of companies&#13;
specialized in topographic surveys with GPS capability. They would carry out the&#13;
following activities: (i) parcel survey and census-taking of owners, noting existing&#13;
infrastructure (roads, channels, populated centers and natural details as rivers and&#13;
streams); and (ii) tour property with the owner or petitioner; adjacent neighbors to&#13;
establish the boundaries of the parcel as well as agreement on the spot where the stakes&#13;
are to be placed. The team members would carry, as part of their working equipment, a&#13;
compass and hand level, a GPS station, and a measuring tape to locate any spot, to mark&#13;
any identifiable site to reference. Farms would be numbered following a cadastral&#13;
geographic code that identifies the province, district, and corregimiento, so that one&#13;
property can have only one number which would be used for all legal matters and&#13;
registration of the property in the public registry, cadastre and all institutions linked with&#13;
titling procedures.&#13;
3.    Preparation for Parcel Registration. The field team would prepare the parcel&#13;
registration documentation, including the signature of the property owner or occupant, as&#13;
well as signature of each adjacent neighbor. If litigation problems arise with one of the&#13;
adjacent neighbors, the property could be registered with a margin annotation indicating&#13;
conflict. Properties would be numbered and the team would hand over the file to a Land&#13;
Reform inspector, notifying the interested parties to meet with the inspector. If no&#13;
agreement is reached, an administrative conflict resolution team would be set up in order&#13;
to proceed with reconciliation; the registration of the boundary under discussion would be&#13;
held back until the conflict resolution team solves the conflict. If not solved, then its&#13;
resolution would proceed to the judicial system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX B&#13;
Page 19 of 20&#13;

4.    Request for Adjudication. The field team, after the conclusion of the definition&#13;
of the property boundaries, would prepare a file with its corresponding number and&#13;
regional code, and hand it over to the Land Reform inspector. The inspector would be&#13;
supervising the work in each cadastral corregimiento. This working methodology, carried&#13;
out for all individual properties in the project area, would form the property field map,&#13;
equivalent to the property's inventory or cadastre at the corregimiento, district and&#13;
province level and at the national level.&#13;
5.    Mapping the corregimiento and generating individual maps for each&#13;
property. The contractor would prepare the cartographic base defining property&#13;
including limits, boundaries, roads, topographic accidents, infrastructures. Once maps for&#13;
each corregimiento are prepared, the contractor would send optical disks of the general&#13;
property maps to the computer center which would be installed in MIDA's office and to&#13;
the Geographic Information System offices, where the information gathered in the field&#13;
would be checked for correctness. This process would be done through a computerized&#13;
system that uses as reference the geographic coordinates obtained by the GPS. The final&#13;
result would be a basic cartography at a desired scale, which in this case would be&#13;
property maps at a 1: 10,000 scale, and individual maps of all farms including all their&#13;
details.&#13;
6.    The Geographic Information System, given the information received from the&#13;
company and the lists of files received from the Land Reform institute, would generate a&#13;
data base including all the information related to the property and its owner. The purpose&#13;
of this data base is to be able to locate the farm through a geographic code defining the&#13;
property as belonging to a sole individual and enable access to search for and annex any&#13;
information through this number, as well as the registry number. The data base and maps&#13;
would constitute the basic cadastre information of this sub-program.&#13;
7.    Adjudication. The Land Reform Office would prepare an adjudication form in&#13;
the computer's data base, in which all information related to the property to be&#13;
adjudicated as well as its beneficiary would be included, in order to produce a&#13;
computerized adjudication form in which only basic information would be added; this form&#13;
would be sent electronically to the Public Registry's regional office in order to issue the&#13;
property deed and register the farm appropriately. MIDA and the Ministry of Justice&#13;
would sign an agreement through which the Public Registry would have to keep the&#13;
cadastre up-dated immediately after every registry transaction.&#13;
8.    Disclosure. An extensive advertising procedure is foreseen (via local authorities&#13;
and communications channels, radio stations, newspapers and television), in order to&#13;
guarantee broad participation during the titling process; working areas, as well as the&#13;
dates in which work would be carried out in an specific corregimiento, would be&#13;
announced with sufficient prior notice to allow maximum participation of stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;

9.    Once the legal file is established, the regional land reform office, in coordination&#13;
with the company that would work on titling, and with support from the mobile offices,&#13;
would carry out the advertising established by law for land adjudication purposes&#13;
(Advertising of Summons). It is estimated that the whole titling process of a given&#13;
property could be carried out in 30 to 45 days, except in areas of conflict.&#13;

RURAL POVERTY AND NATURAL RESOURCE PROJECT&#13;
Proiect Orzanization. Administration and Coordination&#13;
1.    The field organization of the project is described in greater detail in Annexes A and&#13;
B (description of the two components). Project planning, budgeting, monitoring,&#13;
evaluation and supervision is in Annex F. This Annex concentrates on the organization of&#13;
the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU), and the project's implementation schedule.&#13;
2.    The PCU headquarters would be located in the Sustainable Development&#13;
Component area, near Santiago, Veraguas, and the Biodiversity Conservation Component&#13;
would be located in INRENARE in Panama City where more of its project and&#13;
administrative staff are located. INRENARE project staff would liase regularly with the&#13;
PCU, and would have at least one person assigned there permanently. Most staff would&#13;
be reassigned MIDA and INRENARE staff, outside personnel would only be hired when&#13;
necessary skills are not available from the two institutions; at project appraisal, this was&#13;
estimated at ten people.&#13;
3 .    Figure 1 of this Annex provides a functional organigram of the PCU. The project&#13;
would be made up of a Coordinator chosen through competitive procedures, who would&#13;
be approved by the project's Technical and Operational Coordination Council, and with&#13;
the Bank's no-objection. Two heads of department would be appointed to coordinate the&#13;
implementation of each component. Both departments would be supported by a part-time&#13;
legal advisor, and two central units: i) a administrative-financial-accounting unit made up&#13;
of an administrator and two assistants who would be in charge of the administrative and&#13;
accounting registries, contracts and payments, and the purchase of office equipment and&#13;
materials; and ii) a programming and liaison unit with the FUSARD (also located in the&#13;
PCU--see Annex A), headed by a business administrator or agricultural economist, whose&#13;
function would be the programming of activities and monitoring their progress, the&#13;
disbursement of funds for project activities, and a lawyer to draw up the Subproject&#13;
Agreements (grant administration contracts) with implementing organizations that would&#13;
administer FUSARD subproject funds.&#13;
4.    The Sustainable Rural Development Department would be headed by a&#13;
management specialist with considerable experience in training staff that operate in rural&#13;
areas, as well as communities. The Department would be divided into three units:&#13;
Community Organization, Productive Technology Development (agricultural technology,&#13;
mini-irrigation, soil conservation and social reforestation), and Production Support&#13;
Services (marketing, agroindustry and rural roads).&#13;

5.    Their responsibility would be to provide technical services to the communities,&#13;
local organizations, and implementing organizations/service contractors (e.g., NGOs,&#13;
government departments, individual technicians) in the promotion and organization of&#13;
communities and contractors; community planning which would culminate in&#13;
community action plans and investment subprojects to be submitted to the FUSARD; and&#13;
supervise, monitor and control the execution of implementing organizations.&#13;
6.    The Biodiversity Conservation Department's Head would liase with regional&#13;
INRENARE directors (Chriqui, Bocas del Toro, Los Santos, Veraguas, Cocle, Panama&#13;
Metro and Darien) to execute project actions in the protected areas. There would also be&#13;
a person responsible for the ecotourism subcomponent who would be chosen with IPAT's&#13;
(tourism institute) no-objection. In INRENARE headquarters, the institution has built up&#13;
an effective administrative structure to execute the USAID supported Natural Resources&#13;
Management (MARENA) Project. As the project is winding down, this same structure&#13;
would be used for this proposed project. Only an incremental accounting assistant and a&#13;
secretary would be required to implement the component.&#13;
7.    The PCU would be provided with the necessary staff, equipment and vehicles to&#13;
properly implement the project. They would also have the funds to hire consultants for&#13;
project start-up, creating the administrative and operational manuals and training PCU&#13;
staff as required. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 1 of this Annex.&#13;
Project monitoring and evaluation would be carried out by a contracted specialized agency&#13;
(Annex F); reporting is also covered in Annex F.&#13;

PANAMA&#13;
RURAL POVERTY AND NATURAL RESOURCES PROJECT&#13;
Indi2enous Peoples Development Plan&#13;
1.    The following is a summary of the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP),&#13;
which is detailed in document No. 18 of Annex H, Project File. It was prepared by the&#13;
Government of Panama with guidance from the Bank, and involved a participative&#13;
approach, including information sharing of project proposals with the principal indigenous&#13;
peoples represented in the project area, as well as staff and specialists from Government,&#13;
NGO and other institutions that deal with the indigenous communities in question.&#13;
Literature and census reviews and a wide range of interviews were carried out. Although&#13;
five ethnic groups exist in the project area, the great majority are Ngobe-Bugle and&#13;
Embera-Wounaan which were the two groups dealt with principally for the preparation of&#13;
the IPDP.&#13;
Background&#13;
2.    In the Sustainable Rural Development Component area (Provinces of Veraguas&#13;
and Herrera), the Ngobe-Bugle people, totaling approximately 7,006 inhabitants, live in 66&#13;
scattered communities. In the second component, Biodiversity Conservation, there are&#13;
four ethnic groups. The Ngobe-Bugle, the Terire and Bribri in the western part of the&#13;
country, in and around the protected areas (PA) of Amistad and Bastimento. In the&#13;
Darien PA, the ethnic group in and outside the Park (including its buffer zone) is the&#13;
EmberA-Wounaan, with approximately 18,000 people.&#13;
3.    The majority of the Ngobe-Bugle and the Embera-Wounaan are located in remote&#13;
rural areas. Of the five poorest areas in the country, four are in Ngobe-Bugle territory.&#13;
The statistics are appalling: 89.6 percent of these households are poor, 76 percent are in&#13;
extreme poverty, over 90 percent of households are headed by women; of every ten&#13;
children between six and nine years of age, seven are in a very critical nutritional state. In&#13;
Caflazas district, of 427 indigenous households interviewed in the last census, 426 had no&#13;
electricity, and 395 no potable water. In indigenous lands in the poverty area, eighty&#13;
percent of the land has been deforested, and while there is considerable community&#13;
interest in reforestation, there have been instances of lack of agreement as to ownership of&#13;
reforested lands outside the Comarcas (indigenous governed lands) as the State considers&#13;
lands reforested with Government financial assistance but without formal tenure to belong&#13;
to the Government, whereas the indigenous groups claim it is theirs. Sources of income&#13;
include: employment in commercial agriculture, mostly by men who migrate to these&#13;
areas, artifacts sales, and some sales of agricultural produce. The report stated in para. 1&#13;
provides more details of the basic needs situation in indigenous communities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX D&#13;
Page 2 of 6&#13;
4.    Due to legal ambiguity, the Embera-Wounaan Comarca is superposed on the&#13;
Darien National Park, as 44 percent of the Comarca is within the Park's boundaries. At&#13;
present a solution is being negotiated with INRENARE which must be satisfactory to both&#13;
sides, and in particular the indigenous communities which have lived there before the Park&#13;
was created.&#13;
5.    Many of the above problems are structural, and represent the meeting of two very&#13;
different cultures. The indigenous communities economies--although technologically still&#13;
at a subsistence level--have been selectively penetrated by certain aspects of the market&#13;
economy. These two systems, subsistence and market, which coexist in time and space&#13;
in the indigenous communities, despite the fact that they are so different culturally as well&#13;
as chronologically, places these communities in a difficult situation. On the one hand, they&#13;
can no longer continue with their traditional subsistence economy, as they have lost much&#13;
of the material base for such a system (e.g., land degradation which reduces productive&#13;
capacity). On the other hand, they cannot relate effectively to a market economy whose&#13;
principles (e.g., generate profits in a private property system, access to credit and&#13;
technologies) and levels of complexity, values and beliefs are so foreign to their own.&#13;
6.    Thus, the communities are trapped between a past that they can no longer preserve&#13;
as they do not have control over all the necessary elements, particularly the economic&#13;
ones, and a present which they cannot control as the market economy has excluded them&#13;
from many of its benefits.&#13;
7.    The result of these structural contradictions has been, among others, increasing&#13;
material poverty and the consequent social decay. Some of the indigenous groups are no&#13;
longer able to relate to the forces of nature in a culturally, socially and economically&#13;
congruent fashion. Their culture, traditions and territories are converted to merchandise&#13;
in a market economy increasingly out of their control and comprehension: the trees are&#13;
extracted as timber often without their approval, and portions of their land have been&#13;
deforested and taken over by latino (colonist) farmers.&#13;
8.    There has been a considerable number of assistance programs to indigenous&#13;
peoples, increasing during the last thirty years. Most of these programs have had limited&#13;
success however, because they have not responded to the basic problems mentioned&#13;
above. These programs have either tried to glorify the past and tried to reconstruct it (the&#13;
separatist model), or alternately have stressed modernization and tried to insert the&#13;
communities directly into the market economy (the assimilative model). Neither of these&#13;
are adequate or effective in assisting the communities in a sustainable fashion, nor do they&#13;
take into account their basic structural configurations.&#13;
9.    Despite these difficult problems and subsistence economies, indigenous people still&#13;
retain much of their culture, considerable unrealized economic potential exists in their&#13;
areas, and they are gaining increasing political awareness. Their lands are rich in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX D&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
biodiversity, energy, minerals and the groups have a great reserve of knowledge on&#13;
sustainable development as demonstrated by the fact that they have been managing forest&#13;
resources for centuries.&#13;
10.   These problems have resulted in a number of basic principles which many&#13;
indigenous peoples are now trying to follow to guiding their development. These would&#13;
also help guide the project's specific areas of action.&#13;
*  The recognition in principle and practice, of the indigenous peoples basic&#13;
human rights to their culture, their lifestyle and their ancestral territories.&#13;
Effective administration of indigenous reserves and their natural resources,&#13;
according to current Comarca and national legislation.&#13;
*  The adaption of selective practices from the market/western economy at their&#13;
own speed. In this context, training becomes of great importance, in particular&#13;
to strengthen the organizational structures to better deal with western society,&#13;
as well as to introduce new technologies and management skills.&#13;
*  In development actions, dealing withboth the immediate problems faced by&#13;
indigenous groups (e.g. poverty, lack of technology, degradation of resources),&#13;
as well as the more structural/societal problems related to maintaining their&#13;
cultures and forms of government.&#13;
Plan of Action&#13;
11.   Goal: Improvement of the living conditions of indigenous peoples based on the&#13;
sustainable development of natural resources and culturally appropriate benefits, including&#13;
technical assistance and training on legal and natural resource management issues, and&#13;
investment funds both for income producing activities, particularly the revitalization&#13;
agricultural and agroforestry systems, as well as small basic infrastructure. Although the&#13;
legal context is different inside a Comarca, which, within the Panamanian legal system has&#13;
certain autonomous attributes, the same developmental principles would be applied to&#13;
indigenous communities or population outside the Comarcas.&#13;
12.   Objectives:&#13;
* Provide technical assistance and training in order to: i) promote the general&#13;
awareness of indigenous rights to members of the communities in the project&#13;
area, both indigenous and non-indigenous; and ii) improve their livelihoods&#13;
systems (be they forest based, on-farm or off-farm). In concordance with the&#13;
project's participatory and gender approach, the beneficiary population would&#13;
be involved in the design and implementation of specific project activities. To&#13;
facilitate such participation, the project would also help strengthen indigenous&#13;

*  Improve general knowledge related to legal matters affecting indigenous&#13;
peoples. '&#13;
*  As a complement to training/extension efforts, the project would seek to&#13;
facilitate the access to its financial and technical resources so the indigenous&#13;
communities can plan, coordinate and execute small infrastructure and&#13;
productive activities in an economically and environmentally sustainable&#13;
fashion. For the implementation of the above activities it is important to keep&#13;
in mind gender, age and cultural considerations, among them: i) increasing&#13;
women's participation in all activities and decision-making; ii) to plan, design&#13;
and execute training programs that integrate indigenous values and beliefs, with&#13;
special emphasis on indigenous youth; and iii) in as much as possible, utilize&#13;
indigenous project staff from similar ethnic groups, increasing their numbers&#13;
over time as local community members are trained.&#13;
13.   Strategies/Operating Principles&#13;
The proposed project would, where practicable, utilize the following basic&#13;
strategies for implementing the project with indigenous communities:&#13;
(a)    A participatory approach. Starting from information sharing and&#13;
consultation, the project will promote a process which include the gradual&#13;
appropriation by the indigenous communities of the resources that have&#13;
been facilitated by the project, with increasing autonomy from the project.&#13;
The transfer of resources (by the project) and its appropriation (by the&#13;
recipients) would be conducted in a manner consistent with the cultural&#13;
capacity defined by the communities' ability to assimilate project resources.&#13;
(b)    Institutional Strengthening. This includes: planning and executing&#13;
mechanisms to strengthen traditional structures and institutions; guiding&#13;
and training communities relative to the operation of the market economy;&#13;
support to community leaders to participate in wider national and&#13;
international forums so that they may familiarize themselves with ethno-&#13;
development issues in other areas; training leaders to assume representative&#13;
roles. Capacity building is needed in the fields of administration,&#13;
technology, finance, leadership and vocational skills. Members of the&#13;
' The World Bank is in conversation with the Government to undertake a national-level land&#13;
administration project which could deal with the modernization of the registry and cadastre and major&#13;
land regularization/titling activities, including the Comarcas. The RPNR Project's possibilities in this&#13;
field are more limited, as clarified in the project description&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX D&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
communities that have, or acquire the skills through project training, would&#13;
participate in project implementation as extensionists, administrators,&#13;
agricultural technicians, financial administrators, etc.&#13;
(c)   Development respecting cultural diversity. Modernization programs must&#13;
not imply a threat to the continuity of the indigenous culture. Channeling&#13;
funds to the community is not the end in itself, but rather it is the&#13;
community-lead process of diagnosis, identification and preparation of&#13;
investments, and their continued use and increasing autonomous&#13;
management of these investments in a culturally sustainable fashion, that is&#13;
the project's principal objective in these communities. Reducing external&#13;
dependence is equally important to achieve self-sufficiency. Indigenous&#13;
cultures have a great deal of knowledge related to sustainable development&#13;
which, given the juncture at which many communities find themselves,&#13;
between one culture and the other, can, at this time, disappear, or be&#13;
revitalized and utilized not only by the participating communities, but other&#13;
communities in the country as well. This is true for all the project&#13;
components, not just the investments/subprojects, but also training,&#13;
organization, institutional strengthening, and other proposed project&#13;
activities. It is equally important for indigenous youth.&#13;
(d)   A gender approach. Special efforts will be made in order to target&#13;
resources to indigenous women. Women's role in the communities is&#13;
becoming increasingly important, considering that many of the men must&#13;
travel away for long periods for employment purposes, leaving women to&#13;
head most of the households. They are particularly adept at various&#13;
activities including: diversifying from agriculture to e.g., artisanal and&#13;
ethno- and ecotouristic activities. Contact with the market economy has&#13;
brought a change in economic activities towards commerce and&#13;
interchange with other communities: women have taken the lead in these&#13;
new activities. Additionally, women are assuming more important political&#13;
and representational roles which should be encouraged through proper&#13;
training.&#13;
(e)   Awareness of Indigenous Space and Time Dimensions. The above&#13;
described operating principles are all theoretical if indigenous space and&#13;
time dimensions are not properly understood and applied in practice. Such&#13;
notions as efficiency, effectiveness, rationality, fixed time periods have&#13;
very different meaning in each culture. As an example, time is seen in&#13;
indigenous cultures as the movement created by the encounter between the&#13;
past and the present, whereas in western culture "time is money". A&#13;
development strategy, a subproject, a training course, a type of&#13;
organization which has been very successful in other market/western type&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

communities, may be an utter failure in indigenous communities. Thus,&#13;
project promoters, which as much as possible must be from the same ethnic&#13;
group, must allow the communities great freedom in developing their plans&#13;
and projects, and avoid at all costs trying to impose outside ideas. They&#13;
must be facilitators of the communities expressing their own ideas within&#13;
the values of their culture.&#13;
14.   Components&#13;
Most activities in the project areas, including the indigenous areas, are demand-driven by&#13;
the communities, so as to respect their priorities and cultural sensitivities. Thus, it is not&#13;
possible to detail exactly what the project actions would be. However, from the meetings&#13;
held with indigenous groups during project preparation, the following are likely or&#13;
indicative areas of project action.&#13;
1. Technical Assistance and Training&#13;
Training of indigneous NGO's or NGO's that assist indigenous groups;&#13;
Participatory planning in indigenous communities to produce community&#13;
action plans and priorized investment needs;&#13;
Legal Aspects (land tenure, natural resources use, indigenous rights);&#13;
Technical Aspects (productive activities, project management);&#13;
Institutional development and strengthening of indigneous organizations&#13;
(planning, decision-making, strenghtening leadership).&#13;
2. Project Preparation and Investment (Subprojects)&#13;
Productive infrastructure and income-producing activities&#13;
(agriculture, agroforestry, ecotourism);&#13;
Reviving and utilizing traditional knowledge;&#13;
Buffer Zone management;&#13;
Study tours, participation in national and international fora that deal with&#13;
indigenous issues;&#13;
15.   Institutional Issues and Budget. The above component and institutional issues&#13;
and budget must be worked out in greater detail. Funds in the proposed Project&#13;
Preparation Facility (PPF), which would begin activities before the project is actually&#13;
declared effective, would be utilized to complete these aspects of the IPDP.&#13;

ANNEX F&#13;

PANAMA&#13;
RURAL POVERTY AND NATURAL RESOURCE PROJECT&#13;
Plannine. Budeetine, Monitoring and Evaluation and Regorting&#13;
1.    Due to the pilot nature of some of the methodologies utilized in this project,&#13;
effective planning and active monitoring are essential to guide adjustments during project&#13;
implementation and evaluate success relative to project objectives. Planning, monitoring&#13;
and reporting would be the responsibility of the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) with&#13;
MIDA and INRENARE. Financial Indicators, Status of Legal Covenants, Key&#13;
Performance Indicators for each component, and Project Impact Indicators are in&#13;
Appendixes 1 through 4.of this Annex&#13;
2.    Planning and Budgeting. The PCU would prepare an Annual Operating Plan&#13;
(AOP) for each project year based on the phasing of project objectives as indicated in the&#13;
project cost tables and implementation schedule (Annex C). The AOPs would include a&#13;
detailed list of activities to be carried out for each component and subcomponent, their&#13;
timetable, physical inputs required, updated unit prices and total costs, and counterpart&#13;
funding requirements, based on the disbursement percentages of the Bank Loan for each&#13;
category of expenditure. MIDA and INRENARE would include the resource&#13;
requirements for this project in their annual budget submission to the Ministry of Finance.&#13;
The PCU would submit the AOPs and budget requests to the Bank by October of each&#13;
project year.&#13;
3.    Monitoring and Evaluation. Monitoring and evaluating project activities is one&#13;
of the most important management tools particularly for the rural development&#13;
component. The differentiation between the two would be clearly established from the&#13;
beginning as there is often confusion on this theme: monitoring corresponds to the&#13;
continuous assessment of project implementation in relation to agreed schedules, and the&#13;
use of inputs, infrastructure and services by project beneficiaries. Evaluation is the&#13;
periodic assessment of a project's relevance, performance, efficiency and impact (both&#13;
expected and unexpected) in relation to stated objectives.&#13;
4.    While the project would have a small M&amp;E unit made up of the unit head, with&#13;
considerable project field experience, and an assistant, most of the project monitoring&#13;
would be carried out on contract by a specialized institution who would also assist in&#13;
setting up the systems from the beginning of the project. In addition to the project's&#13;
M&amp;E, two other supervision levels would also exist: at the community level by the&#13;
Sustainable Rural Development Committee, and by the NGOs, government agencies, and&#13;
executing agencies that would assist in project implementation. From a financial&#13;
standpoint, use of funds would also be supervised by the communities, project auditors&#13;
(internal and external), and the National Controllers Office.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX F&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
5.   In addition to monitoring information collected for progress reporting as described&#13;
below, the project would carry out base-line surveys to measure changes in the target&#13;
population.&#13;
6.    The PCU would prepare cummulative quarterly reports at the end of each calendar&#13;
year. The quarterly reports would provide evaluations of progress and impact per quarter,&#13;
which would enable MIDA and INREANRE to fine-tune activities, in agreement with the&#13;
Bank. The quarterly reports would be submitted to the Bank within 45 days of the end of&#13;
each quarter.&#13;
7.    Quarterly and annual reports would include the following sections:&#13;
(a)   Summary of project implementation would give a general description of&#13;
project implementation during the period under review, by component,&#13;
including the project's overall status, adherence to the AOPs and&#13;
development impact to date. In addition, this section should comment on&#13;
project administration issues, including fund flows, government budgeting,&#13;
disbursements, procurement, accounts and audits and technical assistance.&#13;
The status of actions proposed and issues unresolved from the previous&#13;
quarterly report, and actions proposed for the following period, would also&#13;
be included.&#13;
(b)   Physical indicators would provide quantitative indication of project&#13;
implementation by component and subcomponent as identified in&#13;
Appendixes 3 and 4.&#13;
(c)   Financial performance. This section would provide a summary of funds&#13;
released by each financier, including government, during the quarter by&#13;
project component and disbursement category (Appendix 1). Procurement&#13;
methods and status by disbursement category, estimated future&#13;
disbursement, status of accounts and audits would also be provided in&#13;
section (a) above.&#13;
(d)   Status of legal covenants. This section would represent a summary of&#13;
compliance with the project's legal covenants with cross-reference to the&#13;
legal documents and the SAR. The information would be presented as&#13;
shown in Appendix 2.&#13;
8.    The format of quarterly and annual reports would be agreed upon with the Bank at&#13;
Project start-up. A draft outline of quarterly reports follows:&#13;

Attachment 3. Tables of Financial Indicators&#13;
Attachment 4. Table showing status of legal covenants.&#13;
9.    In addition to the above sections, annual reports would include an analysis of&#13;
changes between the AOPs and the activities executed during the period under review.&#13;
The annual review would have more elements of measuring project impact (evaluation)&#13;
and would include such elements as the status of:&#13;
* Community participation and role of the project and executing agencies in&#13;
promoting it;&#13;
* Technical assistance and training programs for the communities and particiapting&#13;
agencies;&#13;
* Functioning of all aspects of the subproject cycle;&#13;
* Participation of buffer zone communities in the management of protected areas&#13;
through the joint community/INRENARE management committees;&#13;
* Participation of women in project activities;&#13;
* Acceptance of indigenous groups of project activities and the methodologies used&#13;
to include their participation.&#13;
10.   A list of monitoring and impact indicators is presented in Appendixes 3 and 4&#13;
respectively from which the following ten have been condensed as prime indicators of&#13;
projectprogress in meeting its objective and ensuring satisfactory implementation.&#13;

PANAMA&#13;
RURAL POVERTY AND NATURAL RESOURCES PROJECT&#13;
Economic Analysis of the Community Subvrooects and Protected Areas&#13;
1.    The Sustainable Devepment Component is demand-driven, thus it is impossible to&#13;
accurately determine the allocation of project funds and thus carry out economic analysis&#13;
for the full project. However, indicative economic analysis was carried out on specific&#13;
subproject models identified by communities as being of interest to them during project&#13;
preparation. In addition, the analysis of selected protected areas was also carried out.&#13;
Environmental analysis is further detailed in document 13 of Annex H.&#13;
2.    The analysis results showed the economic feasibility of specific subprojects. Real&#13;
market prices were used for purchased inputs, as well as conservative levels of plant&#13;
capacity use; a conservative 12 percent discount rate; labor costs at official prices'&#13;
assuming that opportunity cost is the same as the official minimum wage. The models&#13;
(except forest plantations and agro-industries) were designed for a five-year period,&#13;
corresponding to the Project period; however, the working life of these models is&#13;
generally longer. The models' analyses are summarized in Table 1.&#13;
Forestry Subprojects&#13;
3.     Timber Seed Enterprises. A plant to process 100 kg. of seeds during a four&#13;
months/year period at real sale prices of $130/kg was designed. A 20 percent initial&#13;
capacity (considering staff inexperience) and a 70 percent final capacity yields an IRR of&#13;
22.2 percent and a $2716 net present value of that investment at a 12 percent discount&#13;
rate. The enterprise could bear a 25 percent price reduction, and an increase to 100&#13;
percent of its productive capacity and still yield an IRR of 15.6 percent, a benefit/cost&#13;
ratio of 1.14, and generate more than 400 workdays per year.&#13;
4.    Commercial nurseries. Nurseries having a capacity to produce up to 250,000&#13;
seedlings/year (200,000 timber-yielding and 50,000 fruit trees) would be established. Data&#13;
are based on the increase of the real demand under the incentives provided by the&#13;
Reforestation Law No. 24 of November 23, 1992. The initial fixed investment is&#13;
estimated at US$7,063, and the working capital for the first year would be financed.&#13;
Production would start at a 30 percent capacity and reach full production by the third&#13;
year; sales have been estimated at $0.15 per forest seedling and $0.50 per fruit seedling&#13;
(prices are below commercial prices2), in order to better access the market. At these&#13;
prices, the enterprise would yield a robust 24.3 percent IRR, and a $15,823 net present&#13;
Minimum wages are frequently not paid in the region.&#13;
2 The commercial price of the seedlings is $0.20 for timber-yielding seedlings and $0.60 for fruit tree&#13;
seedlings.&#13;

IRR is obtained, and a benefit/cost ratio of 1.77.&#13;

5.     Reforestation Subprojects. The econormic feasibility of one hectare plantation of&#13;
pine trees (exotic species already introduced in the region two decades ago) and one of&#13;
cedar (cedro - a native species) was analyzed, as well as a 4,000 ha. plantation which&#13;
approximates total demand for establishing community forests (these are areas that already&#13;
have mature forests being harvested). First revenues would be obtained as of year 12&#13;
(pine) and 15 (cedar). This is not economically sustainable for the average project&#13;
beneficiary, if they are not supported with alternatives which generate short and medium&#13;
term revenues or associated activities (for example, agro-forestry). Reforestation is the&#13;
only activity considered in the model, and combinations with other short-term models has&#13;
not been carried out.&#13;
6.      Sales prices per square meter of wood are market prices3, as well as the cost of the&#13;
seedlings ($0.20). In a one ha. pine plantation, retums would be obtained at year 12&#13;
through thinning of thin and medium-sized trees which can be used in construction. The&#13;
zone's vegetation is herbaceous with degraded soils, and therefore there are lower clearing&#13;
costs than those associated with other types of soils and vegetation. A 20 year felling&#13;
period is estimated, obtaining a 17% internal rate of return (IRR) and a benefit/cost ratio&#13;
of 6.57. In a one ha. cedar plantation, although gross revenues are larger because the&#13;
3 US$10 per square foot of thin wood, US$60 per square foot of medium-sized wood and USS80 per&#13;
square foot of thick wood.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX G&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
wood volume increases and is quoted at a higher price, the economic return is lower (14&#13;
percent IRR) because the period to harvest is longer (years 15 and 22) as well as the&#13;
felling age (30 years). Greater incentives to develop these projects will be provided by&#13;
combining reforestation with shorter-term production models (para 5).&#13;
7.    In the 4.000 ha. plantation model, regular interval planting of 1,000 ha./year is&#13;
considered. Initial investment includes only basic tools (hoe, machete, pruner) assuming&#13;
that all tasks will be manual; labor represents more than 90 percent of operational costs.&#13;
Re-planting costs will be US$2.7 million and maintenance costs (thinning, wood joint,&#13;
pruning and felling) represent US$2.2 million. At year 13, the first thinnings are obtained,&#13;
with increasing revenues as of that year. At year 23, revenues would amount to US$62.0&#13;
million, which represents a 19 percent IRR and a net present value of US$25,040 at a 12&#13;
percent discount rate.&#13;
Agroindustries&#13;
8.    Agro-industry models were costed at market values and reasonable estimates of&#13;
productive capacity in the region; operating costs correspond to real prices (raw materials&#13;
and inputs, transport, etc.) for the three plant models:&#13;
9.    Rural Cheese Production. Macaracas and Sona are dairy districts; most of&#13;
production is sold as fresh milk. The cheese plant was designed with a capacity to process&#13;
up to 156,000 Its. of milk/year, starting with a 50 percent capacity, and reaching 96&#13;
percent in five years. The equipment is simple, and may be adapted to manufacture other&#13;
products (yogurt, ricotta, etc.). When estimating wholesale prices at market prices&#13;
($0.85/12 ounce cheese) a 20 percent IRR is obtained, with a net present value of $7,091&#13;
at 12 percent. The activity is quite sensitive to price modifications: a five percent price&#13;
reduction brings about a 90 percent reduction in the IRR (0.92) and a negative NPV (-&#13;
8.000), with a benefit/cost ratio less than one. Its positive effect is significant in terms of&#13;
employment, since each plant could generate more than 1,200 workdays per year;&#13;
furthermore, it would reduce fresh milk losses reported in the region.&#13;
10.   Coffee Processing Plant. This enterprise is feasible in the highlands of Veraguas&#13;
and Los Santos, where coffee is produced but not processed. Considering a 55 percent&#13;
initial plant capacity which reaches 75 percent by year five, a fixed investment of $26,604,&#13;
in a 10-year production period, the plant yields a 30 percent IRR, selling husked coffee at&#13;
US$70/qq, which is lower than the market price (US$75/qq). In the sensitivity analysis,&#13;
estimating a 5 percent reduction on a US$70/qq price, the enterprise would continue to be&#13;
profitable (a 12.6 percent IRR with a net present value of $2,178 at 12 percent and a&#13;
benefit/cost ratio of 1.03).&#13;
11.   Fruit Processing Plant. The region produces local and export fruits (cantaloupes,&#13;
watermelons, pineapples). This activity generates a considerable quantity of rejected fruits&#13;
which could be used as raw material for ice-cream manufacture, restaurants, refreshment&#13;
stores, pastry shops, etc. A plant with a 1,420 metric ton capacity of fruit per year was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX G&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
designed, with a US$110,900 investment, including a refrigerated truck to transport the&#13;
processed product (excluding the truck, the investment would amount to US$85,900).&#13;
3120 workdays per year would be created, which increases as the plant use does (starts at&#13;
25 percent and reaches 60 percent). This yields a 16.1% IRR and a present value of&#13;
$27,140 at a 12 percent discount rate. The sensitivity analysis showed high susceptibility&#13;
to price variations of the final product. A five percent reduction in the final product price,&#13;
not increasing the production capacity, would reduce the IRR to 11.0 percent.&#13;
12.   Wood Industry. There are 7,500 state-owned ha. of pine trees in the region,&#13;
which were planted in the 1970's and are only just beginning to be industrialized (by a&#13;
local cooperative); furthermore, the country annually imports around US$2.0 million of&#13;
pine wood, thus demand seems secure. The mobile sawmill would require a fixed capital&#13;
investment of US$53,456. Using market prices for the raw material (US$118 per square&#13;
meter of wood at the sawmill) and a real market price (US$200/sq. meter) a 18.9 percent&#13;
IRR is obtained, with a net present value of US$11,686. At present, INRENARE (the&#13;
only owner of pine plantations of felling age) is selling the wood to the cooperative at a&#13;
symbolic price of US$21 per sq. meter (which only represents 17 percent of the market&#13;
price).&#13;
Agricultural Subprojects&#13;
13.   Productive Projects: three models were developed: one with a low technological&#13;
level and two with medium technological levels in order to evaluate the technical and&#13;
economic feasibility of options which promote a self-sustainable productive system, with&#13;
minimum changes to existing agronomic cultural practices.&#13;
(a)   Low Technology Model. Production in crop succession&#13;
(rice/corn/beans/cassava) for marginal subsistence producers (PR1).&#13;
Contour lines and organic fertilizers are introduced; prices of inputs, labor&#13;
and final product are market levels. Improved auto-consumption is an&#13;
objective (especially in indigenous communities) as well as the generation&#13;
of small surpluses for sale. Between 50 and 75 percent of operating costs&#13;
are labor (family) costs. A five-year period is estimated to incorporate&#13;
productivity increases generated by the technology. The average annual&#13;
operating costs are US$746, obtaining a 49 percent IRR and the creation&#13;
of more than 100 workdays per year, with small, realistic increases in&#13;
productivity. At the end of the period, a US$1,290 net present value is&#13;
obtained.&#13;
(b)   Medium Technology Models. Options for PR2/PR3 and/or PRI with&#13;
better soils, commercial orientation, and some chemical inputs are&#13;
incorporated. In these cases, labor represents between 35 and 55 percent&#13;
of the total cost: a) Squash production (1 ha.): for the export market.&#13;
Approximate costs per ha/year is US$619 with yields of 200 qq which&#13;
generate a 61 percent IM; b) Otoe production (1 ha.): has good market&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

demand both in the local and export markets. Annual costs would amount&#13;
to US$581, obtaining a present value of US$374 at 12 percent and a 72&#13;
percent IRR.&#13;

            Panama - Rural Poverty and Natural
            Resources Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The principal objectives of the Rural
            Poverty and Natural Resources Project are to: (1) apply, on
            a pilot basis, methodologies that will channel financial
            resources to rural communities to help them promote
            sustainable productive systems, and thereby reduce rural
            poverty, the degradation of natural resources, and
            migration; and (2) promote the sustainable use and
            conservation of selected priority biodiversity areas.
            Special emphasis will be placed on gender and indigenous
            aspects. Specific operational goals include: creating
            capacity at the local level to organize, self-diagnose
            problems, plan activities, seek out and negotiate
            assistance, and act to resolve priority quality of life
            issues; (2) establishing a demand-driven financing mechanism
            operating in high poverty areas and providing matching
            grants to communities; and (3) promoting long-term
            conservation and sustainable use of Panama's
            biodiversity resources. To meet these objectives, the
            project will finance three components: (a) sustainable rural
            development, promoting community training, organization,
            planning, and investment; (b) biodiversity conservation,
            financing research and planning and environmental impact
            assessment and monitoring, capacity building for
            participants and institutional strengthening in
            environmental impact assessment processes; and (c)
            activities contributing to biodiversity conservation and
            sustainable use; and (c) coordination of the two components
            by a unit also financed to provide technical assistance and
            studies related to rural development and natural resources management.
