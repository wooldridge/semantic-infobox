COASTAL FOREST RECONSTRUCTION AND PROTECTION PROJECT&#13;
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
BORROWER:              Republic of Croatia&#13;
BENEnCLuRIES:          Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Hrvatske Sume (Croatian Forests),&#13;
and Ministry of Interior&#13;
AMOuNT:                US$42 million&#13;
TERMs:                  17 years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable&#13;
interest rate.&#13;
PROJECT OBJECTIVES:   The main objective of the project is to restore and protect forest land in the&#13;
coastal zone of Croatia in order to enhance landscape and recreation values&#13;
of the region and thereby contribute to restore tourism to its pre-war level.&#13;
Other objectives related to the project's main objective are to (i) restore the&#13;
environmental role of coastal forests destroyed by the war, in protecting soils&#13;
and waters, and initiate the restoration of the natural vegetation; (ii) address&#13;
the problem of forest fire that is a crucial threat to coastal areas; and (iii)&#13;
develop the knowledge base for improved management and protection of&#13;
coastal forests.&#13;
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  The project, to be implemented over 5 years, would include the following 3&#13;
components: (i) reconstruction of coastal forests destroyed by war activities&#13;
including the rehabilitation of about 5,800 ha of forests, and the&#13;
reconstruction of one nursery and one arboretum; (ii) forest fire management&#13;
in coastal areas including a comprehensive package of prevention, pre-&#13;
suppression, and suppression measures including the purchase of a new&#13;
seaplane air-tanker; and (iii) support services including the development of a&#13;
GIS for forest fire management, research in coastal forestry, institutional&#13;
support to Hrvatske Sume (HS) and the Ministry of Interior (Mol), and&#13;
project management and monitoring.&#13;
PROJECT BENEFITS&#13;
AND RISKS:             Benefits. Most of the benefits expected from the project would be improved&#13;
landscape and environmental conditions of coastal forests, resulting from the&#13;
reconstruction of forests destroyed by the war and from the reduction in areas&#13;
of coastal forests burnt by fires. These major benefits are expected, in turn,&#13;
to contribute to increased economic benefits from the rehabilitation of tourism&#13;
in coastal areas. Other commercial, social, and institutional and scientific&#13;
benefits would also be generated either by forest reconstruction and protection&#13;
activities or by project activities related to support services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ii -&#13;
Risks. The main project risks are associated with the possibility of hostility&#13;
resumption, and the delay in tourism recovery. The risk of hostilities within&#13;
Croatia has been significantly reduced as a result of the re-establishment of&#13;
Government control, in early August 1995, over most of Croatia's territory,&#13;
and of the Peace Agreement reached in November 1995 in neighboring&#13;
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Although there may continue to be regional tensions,&#13;
the risk of conflict-related damage to project investments is small. The&#13;
potential risk of reduced benefits of the project due to delay in the recovery&#13;
of the tourist industry has been mitigated by adopting conservative values in&#13;
the assumptions used in the economic analysis of the project. The sensitivity&#13;
analysis shows that reforestation remains profitable even if tourism recovers&#13;
to only two-thirds of prewar levels within a six-year period.&#13;

COASTAL FOREST RECONSTRUCTION AND PROTECTION PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1    Croatia has a large and well managed forest resource base, of just over 2.4 million ha or 43.5 %&#13;
of the total land area, that is a strong asset for both economic development and environmental protection.&#13;
The soil and climatic conditions, specially in the inland part of the country, are extremely favorable for&#13;
productive forestry. Coastal forests, which belong to the Mediterranean type, are far less productive than&#13;
the continental forests; however, they have high environmental, amenity, and landscape values, in&#13;
particular for tourism which is the main economic activity in coastal areas (tourist income generated on&#13;
the coast reached some US$2 billion in 1990). About 80% of Croatian forests are public owned and&#13;
managed by the Hrvatske Sume ("Croatian Forests") public enterprise, under the control of the Ministry&#13;
of Agriculture and Forestry. The latter has recently developed a comprehensive National Forest Policy&#13;
that aims at sustainable development of all the different types of forest, environment protection, and&#13;
conservation of forest biodiversity, and which has been adopted by the Parliament. Croatia has a broad&#13;
range of wood industries with significant development potential; however, technology and equipment are&#13;
in many cases outdated and the industry faces structural problems in the ongoing transition. The average&#13;
contribution of forestry and the wood industry to GNP, about 4%, has been rather constant over the last&#13;
years. Croatia is a net exporter of industrial wood products, which represent about 12% of total Croatian&#13;
exports during the pre-war period.&#13;
1.2    Croatia's forestry sector has been seriously affected by the recent war. About 30% of the forest&#13;
land has been in occupied territories for four years, thus reducing the annual national wood production.&#13;
Outside these territories where the impact of the war is being assessed, about 100,000 ha of forests have&#13;
been affected by minefields, shelling, fires, and other destruction which have resulted in severe impact&#13;
on forest resources (including wildlife), and forest management infrastructures. About 15,000 ha of&#13;
forests have been completely destroyed, mainly in the coastal areas where the war has deeply affected&#13;
the economy, mostly based on tourism, and local employment.&#13;
1.3    While the problems of inland forests are being solved by the Government, coastal forests of&#13;
Croatia deserve immediate attention and assistance.  Indeed, Croatian coastal forests, like most&#13;
Mediterranean forests, have large areas of degraded stands resulting from intense and long lasting human&#13;
pressure for timber, fuel, and grazing. In addition to being the most affected by recent war activities,&#13;
they have been neglected in the past, in comparison with inland forests, in terms of protection and&#13;
management. They are also most sensitive to fire, mostly of human origin, that ravage a significant area&#13;
every year because of growing human pressure, and also inefficient fire control systems due to&#13;
insufficient Government financial resources.&#13;
1.4    Against this background, the Government of the Republic of Croatia has requested assistance to&#13;
help finance this project which was prepared between September 1994 and April 1995 by a Croatian&#13;
preparation team, with the assistance of the Bank and FAO/CP, using a PHRD Japanese Grant and other&#13;
cooperation funds from donor governments. Pre-appraisal of the project was completed in October 1995,&#13;
and the project was appraised in February 1996; the environmental review was carried out in summer&#13;
and fall 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
CHAPTER II. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. The Forestry Sector&#13;
2.1    Forestry in the Economy. In the national accounting system, the forestry sector in Croatia is&#13;
subdivided in 4 sub-sectors: forest activities, lumber and panels industries, final wood products industries&#13;
and pulp and paper industries. The average contribution of the forest and wood industries to GNP has&#13;
been rather constant over the period 1988-1993 (minimum value: 3.72 % in 1990, maximum value: 3.97%&#13;
in 1988). On average, forest activities account for 30% of gross production in the sector (1.15% of&#13;
GNP), lumber and panels 20% (0.75% of GNP), finished wood products 35% (1.29%) and pulp and&#13;
paper 15% (0.53% of GNP). In absolute terms the sector's gross production increased in 1993 but, in&#13;
the forest and pulp and paper sub-sectors, it is still far below the pre-war period. The forest and wood&#13;
industry sector represents an important source of employment for Croatia: a stable 4.5% of the labor&#13;
force (46,300 people) is employed in forest activities and in related wood industries; however in absolute&#13;
terms employment in the sector has dramatically decreased in the last 5 years (-35.6% of the total 71,900&#13;
employed in 1990); considerable reductions in relative and absolute terms have occurred in the final wood&#13;
products sub-sector.&#13;
2.2    Croatia is a net exporter of wood products and, despite the serious problems arising from the need&#13;
to restructure its industry and adapting it to Western markets, Croatia has gradually increased exports not&#13;
only of semi-finished products but also of finished wood products in the post-war period. As a&#13;
percentage of total Croatian exports, export of wood products in 1993 (US$ 460 million) reached the&#13;
same level as during the pre-war period (11.8% in 1988). Italy is the first export market for wood&#13;
products from Croatia, mainly for sawnwood and logs; Germany comes second, mainly for final wood&#13;
products. Imports of wood products (US$ 124 million in 1993) are mainly represented by final wood&#13;
products and pulp and paper; on average imports of wood products represent less than 2% of total&#13;
Croatian imports.&#13;
2.3   In addition, the forest fulfills numerous public functions, that are not included in the GNP&#13;
calculations. Forests play an important role in protecting the environment; they protect soils from erosion&#13;
in mountainous areas, and they contribute significantly in regulating water regimes. As mentioned below,&#13;
they entail an important part of Croatia's biodiversity. Forests have also high amenity and landscape&#13;
values; they are an important part of Croatia's touristic assets in the mountains as well as on the&#13;
Mediterranean coast and on the islands.&#13;
2.4    Forest Biodiversity. Croatia has a high diversity of forest ecosystems which belong to three&#13;
broad forest types: (i) lowlandforests on alluvial deposits along the rivers of central and eastern Croatia&#13;
at elevations from 80m to 200 m; (ii) mountain forests ranging from 200 m to 1,200 m, from Slovenia&#13;
in the east to the border of Slavonia in the west and to the southern reaches of the Dinaric Mountains;&#13;
the latter, a World Heritage Site, and adjoining coastal hills support unique forest communities on karstic&#13;
soils; and (iii) coastal forests on the coast and in the islands that are evenly distributed among&#13;
Mediterranean and sub-Mediterranean belts; these forests have been long impacted by human use and&#13;
abuse. The native flora of Croatia includes about 3,600 species; 260 of the estimated 312 endemic plant&#13;
species occur in forests. The latter also support abundant wildlife populations, the most conspicuous of&#13;
which are the red and roe deer, wild boar, and rare species such as lynx, brown bear, and otter. The&#13;
recent red list of Croatian flora and fauna contains 124 plant species, mostly herbaceous and woody shrub&#13;
species, and 28 mammals species, many of which occur in forest habitats.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3 -&#13;
2.5    Conservation of biodiversity is an important concern of Croatia's Government; the Convention&#13;
on Biological Diversity was the first international agreement it has signed. Croatian legislation on nature&#13;
protection and the sustainable use of biodiversity is comparable to the legislation of other European&#13;
countries, and includes: the Law on Nature Conservation (updated in 1994), a new Law on Hunting&#13;
(adopted in 1994), the Law on Environmental Protection (updated in 1994), and the Law on Freshwater&#13;
Fishing of 1986. Some 446,000 ha are classified as protected areas, or close to 8% of the country, and&#13;
are managed under the authority of the State Agency for the Conservation of Cultural and Natural&#13;
Heritage. The most important are 7 National Parks (69,000 ha), 2 Strict Reserves (2,500 ha); and 6&#13;
Nature Parks (318,000 ha).&#13;
2.6    Forest Resources and Uses. Croatia is endowed with important forest resources. As much as&#13;
43.5% of the Croatian territory is covered by forest land (2.5 million ha), which is amongst the highest&#13;
rates of forest cover in Central Europe. About 84% of forest land are closed forests. As mentioned&#13;
above, the Croatian forests are rich in biodiversity with some 260 forest autochthonous woody plants of&#13;
which 60 are economically important. In total, 84% of the standing stock of the Croatian forests are&#13;
broadleaves. Beech (Fagus silvatica, 35%) and different oaks (Quercus robur, Q. petraea, Q. cerris,&#13;
Q. pubescens, 28%) are the dominating broadleaves and among the conifers it is the fir (Abies alba, 10%)&#13;
which has the largest share. In very general terms the high quality forests are located in the inland and&#13;
are dominated by high value broadleaved trees like beech and oak, while the coast and islands are&#13;
dominated by relatively low quality pines and Mediterranean broadleaves. The average standing volume&#13;
is 121 m3s ob/ha, which is about the same as Bulgaria (122), slightly less than the European average&#13;
(129) but considerably less than Romania (&gt;200). It is principally the coastal forests which reduce the&#13;
national average standing stock, otherwise the inland forests are quite well stocked. The State forests,&#13;
constituting 81% (2 million ha) of the forest land, are managed by Hrvatske Sume (HS) since 1991. The&#13;
remaining forest land is owned by some 350,000 private forest owners, with an average holding of 1.3&#13;
ha, and by some public institutions.&#13;
2.7    The Croatian forests have traditionally been an important source of raw material for the&#13;
prosperous wood processing industry which was part of the former Yugoslavian economy. The annual&#13;
allowable cut for the forests managed by HS is estimated at 5.2 million m3s ob, but considerably less has&#13;
been utilized during the 1990s, mostly because of war activities. In average, during the period HS has&#13;
been operating (1991-95), some 3.2 million m3s ob were harvested annually generating some US$110&#13;
million a year on average. In 1993 about half the harvested volume was used for sawing, 20% for&#13;
pulping and 30% for fuelwood. The low proportion of pulpwood is partly due to the fact that most of&#13;
the pulpmills in former Yugoslavia were situated in what at present is Bosnia, so it has been difficult to&#13;
market pulpwood during this period.&#13;
2.8    Forest products other than wood are very important. Thanks to varied ecological conditions,&#13;
wildlife is rich and abundant. Forests, from plains to high mountains, are the natural habitat of many&#13;
game species (e.g., red deer, roe deer, fallow deer, chamois, mouflon, bear, wild boar, brown hare,&#13;
pheasant). Hunting activities are already generating significant income in HS and, according to the FAO,&#13;
have a very high growth potential. Forest lands include an important hydrographic network which is rich&#13;
in fish resources.  Croatian forests also offer a wide range of forest fruits, berries, and edible&#13;
mushrooms.&#13;
2.9    Forest Management.  Croatian forests are managed for multi-purposes, i.e., sustainable&#13;
production of wood and non-wood products, for conservation and protection of the environment, for&#13;
recreational purposes, and for amenity. The last two purposes are specifically important in the coastal&#13;
area where tourism is the predominant source of income. The main goals of forest management in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
Croatia are to increase the area of forests devoted to protection, to improve the ecological standards of&#13;
silvicultural treatments, and to enhance the production capacity of the forests. Forests are categorized&#13;
into commercial forests (95 percent) that have the main function to produce wood and other forest&#13;
products, and unexploitable forests (2 percent) and protective forests (3 percent) where silvicultural and&#13;
harvesting activities have strong limitations or are forbidden. Some 300,000 ha of forests in protected&#13;
areas are managed under particular limitations specific to each area.&#13;
2.10   Silvicultural management of Croatian forests is predominantly based on natural regeneration&#13;
including (i) successive and selective felling systems, with cleaning, thinning, intermediate cutting and&#13;
sanitary felling in the 1.084 million ha of highforests; and (ii) improvement of degraded forest or&#13;
conversion of coppices to highforests in an area of 883,000 ha. In addition, some 94,000 ha have been&#13;
planted over the years, including about 40,000 ha of fast growing broadleaved species. Nursery activities&#13;
are organized over some 450 ha by HS and the Forest Research Institute (FRI) in Jastrebarsko.&#13;
2.11   Since 1769, when Empress Maria Theresia of Austria issued the first forest law, Croatian inland&#13;
forests have been managed on a sustainable basis. At present all inland forests are subject to a Forest&#13;
Management Plan (FMP) valid for a 10-year period. These FMPs have become increasingly sophisticated&#13;
over the years and are now being made available for district managers on desk top computers in order&#13;
to facilitate operational planning. This system has been implemented in seven out of a total of 15 regions.&#13;
The annual allowable cut (AAC) set in these management plans is lower than the potential biological&#13;
increment because of increasing protective functions assigned to forests and of rather long rotations for&#13;
most of forest species.&#13;
2.12   However, coastal forests have been neglected until now in comparison with inland forests. In&#13;
spite of their advanced degradation in many areas, coastal forests have been given little attention when&#13;
sustainable forest management principles were adopted in Croatia; minimal investment resource have been&#13;
devoted until recently to restore the most degraded areas; research in coastal forest management is still&#13;
under-developed when compared with the remarkable development of research on inland forests; and the&#13;
development of FMPs is beginning under a program that has started with the creation of HS only, and&#13;
is supposed to be completed by 2000.&#13;
2.13   Marketing and Pricing of Forest Products. About 95%  of the wood is marketed by HS&#13;
according to a system of roundwood pricing that includes a mixture of auctions and fixed pricing, but&#13;
does not distort wood prices significantly. The modalities of the pricing system are defined by a special&#13;
committee including representatives of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry,&#13;
the Chamber of Commerce, HS, and Croatiadrvo (the association of Croatian wood industries). The&#13;
system operates according to the following three methods: (i) price list defined and adjusted twice a year&#13;
for each assortment and species according to price movements on European markets, with particular&#13;
reference to those in the two principal importer countries (Germany and Italy); the price list method is&#13;
used as basis for supplying large- and medium-size wood industries; some 65% of the sales, for 80% of&#13;
the volume, were made in the recent years under contracts based on the price list method: average price&#13;
per rn3 at mill gate were US$88 in 1994 and US$93 in 1995; (ii) domestic auctions for Croatian operators&#13;
only under which about 25% of the sales, for 15% of the volume, were made: average price per m3 at&#13;
mill gate were US$93 in 1994 and US$90 in 1995; and (iii) international auctions, for high quality export&#13;
logs, under which about 10% of the sales, for 5% of the volume, were made: average border price per&#13;
m3 were US$259 in 1994 and US$161 in 1995. The price list method, which is supposed to be the less&#13;
favorable for HS, may affect the income of the latter in the long run. The Government intends to phase&#13;
it out, however only progressively in order to ease the difficult ongoing transition of the wood industry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
2.14   Wood Industry. The wood industry -- which is located all over the country, with the exception&#13;
of the costal region -- has been largely developed during the 1960s into heavy and large wood processing&#13;
conglomerates dealing with all the sectors of the industry, from sawmilling to furniture and panel&#13;
production. Since the 1980s, the wood industry is suffering from stagnating investments resulting in&#13;
decreasing efficiency. Since the end of 1993, the whole wood industry is under the privatization process.&#13;
So far, the average percentage of State ownership, through the Croatian State Fund, is around 55% of&#13;
the enterprises, the rest has been shared between workers (35%), and other shareholders (15%).&#13;
Recently, new small size sawmills with generally old equipment have been created as a consequence of&#13;
the liberalization of the sector, but there are also a few newly created modern furniture enterprises. The&#13;
wood industry has been deeply affected by the war and by the subsequent problems: (i) the collapse of&#13;
the traditional pre-war markets; (ii) the collapse of the wood industry in the former occupied territories,&#13;
although destruction seems to have affected heavily only one factory, out of 12 in this area; (iii) the low&#13;
demand of the domestic market; (iv) the disorganization of the commercial flows of wood (lack of wood&#13;
supplies from the former occupied territories, and the loss of the market in that zone); and (v) the general&#13;
difficulties faced by the Croatian economy. This situation results in increased overcapacity -- the present&#13;
rate of actual utilization of existing production capacity is 42% for the sawmill, veneer and board&#13;
industry, and 47% for the furniture industry -- and to financial losses of the wood industry.&#13;
2.15   The key elements of a strategy to address the problems of the wood industry in Croatia would&#13;
be: (i) developing the ongoing promotion of exports, with a focus on more efficient marketing and&#13;
improved quality of products; (ii) supporting the restructuring of the conglomerates by providing&#13;
assistance to designing, evaluating and implementing their fragmentation into small, coherent and&#13;
independent industrial units based on one core business, with access to leasing or renting schemes for the&#13;
workers -- one good example of such a restructuring is the RADIN Company (saw mill and furniture&#13;
factory) in Ravna Gora; (iii) easing the access to credit, which is indeed dramatically missing in the whole&#13;
wood industry; (iv) speeding-up the privatization process; (v) addressing the problem of unpaid&#13;
receivables due to Hrvatske Sume by the wood industries (HS and the MAF are working on possible&#13;
solutions); and (vi) develop a roundwood sale system supporting the wood industry but more suitable to&#13;
a liberalized market.&#13;
2.16   National Forest Policy. A National Forest Policy (NFP) has been recently developed and&#13;
adopted in Croatia, which is presented in the following two documents (i) "Condition and Organization&#13;
of Forestry in Croatia and Public Enterprise Hrvatske kume, with Measures for their Improvement",&#13;
adopted by the Parliament in 1994; and (ii) "Development Program of Hrvatske Sume (1991 - 2025)"&#13;
adopted in the wake of the creation of HS in 1991. The general objectives of the NFP, i.e. sustainable&#13;
development, environment protection, and biodiversity conservation, are in line with the accepted&#13;
resolutions of different international Agreements signed by Croatia. Some more specific objectives of&#13;
the NFP are the following:&#13;
* enhancement of the multipurpose and economically sustainable use of the forests, mainly based&#13;
on natural regeneration of mixed even-aged or uneven-aged highforests;&#13;
* protection of the forest resources from different sources of degradation: mostly fires in coastal&#13;
forests, but also pests and diseases, and illegal fellings (mainly concentrated in private forests);&#13;
* rehabilitation of degraded forest resources in the Mediterranean areas, reconstruction of forests&#13;
destroyed by the war, and afforestation of marginal agricultural land; the aims of these policies&#13;
are nature conservation, environment protection, countryside improvement in the coastal tourist&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -&#13;
areas, and production of timber with fast growing species (poplars and willows) in the lowlands&#13;
of the Eastern part of the country;&#13;
* ensuring a steady supply of high quality rough material to the domestic wood working industry,&#13;
increasing added value and export revenues from a restructured and modernized wood working&#13;
industry, thus maintaining the current level of 40,000 people employed in the forestry and wood&#13;
working sector.&#13;
2.17   The main strategic options adopted under the NFP are the following:&#13;
* developing centralized management of State forests which were once managed by independent&#13;
units with resulting disparities, in management quality and level of investments, between the&#13;
productive inland forests and the degraded and less productive Mediterranean forests. With the&#13;
creation of HS, and the development of its General Management Plan, financial resources can be&#13;
transferred to achieve a better balance of funds, personnel and investments between different&#13;
areas of the country;&#13;
* improving the management of private forests through mandatory FMPs, and the technical&#13;
(extension and technical advice) and financial (provision of seedlings and forest protection works)&#13;
assistance of HS;&#13;
* privatizing 70 % of commercial activities currently carried out by HS, such as forest silvicultural&#13;
works (cleaning, early thinnings, pruning), harvesting (fuelwood collection, timber felling and&#13;
skidding), log transport, and various other non-core activities of HS;&#13;
* developing a more efficient relationship between forestry and the wood industry by concentrating&#13;
policy making in one Ministry (i.e. the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry), opening the wood&#13;
market to domestic and international competition, and devising incentives to support war-affected&#13;
enterprises and to export more wood products.&#13;
2.18   There are three fundamental instruments to implement the NFP:&#13;
* the Forest Law 52/90, approved in 1990 and amended in 1993, which defines the general&#13;
objectives and organization of public intervention in the sector and establishes new financial&#13;
mechanisms including: (i) the obligation for all forest owners in Croatia to invest 15% to 20%&#13;
of the income from wood sales into "Simple Biological Reproduction" (i.e. regeneration and&#13;
maintenance of existing forests), and an additional 3 % into "Extended Biological Reproduction"&#13;
(i.e. investments in extended forests); and (ii) the obligation for all Croatian commercial and&#13;
industrial companies to pay a 0.07% tax on their turnover, which is transferred to HS, to finance&#13;
investments in forest improvement for environmental purposes, including restoration of degraded&#13;
forests in the karst areas and forest research.&#13;
* the General Management Plan of HS approved in 1993 which combines all the various FMPs&#13;
compiled at local level and defines, for the country and for the different HS management units,&#13;
optimal growing stock and AAC, removals, area to be afforested or ameliorated, infrastructures,&#13;
investments needed, etc.;&#13;
* the HS annual budget approved by Parliament which defines short term objectives, public&#13;
financing and the pricing system for roundwood sold by the State enterprise.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
2.19   Public Institutions. The highest administrative authority in the forestry sector is the Ministry&#13;
of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF); the Ministry operates through the Forestry and Wildlife Department&#13;
which is organized in two Divisions: the Forestry and Wildlife Division and a Division with inspection&#13;
duties carried out at the level of the 22 administrative districts ("Zupanija").&#13;
2.20   The State enterprise Hrvatske Sume (HS) was created in 1991, according to the Forest Law. For&#13;
the first time in Croatia's history, HS is responsible for managing all State and other public forest land&#13;
(about 2 million ha) under the control of the MAF. HS is a financially autonomous enterprise, managed&#13;
by a Director General who reports to a 9-member Executive Board -- 6 members are appointed by the&#13;
Government and 3 members are elected by HS's employees -- which has ultimate authority in&#13;
management and financial matters. HS is organized in 15 forest districts ("Uprava Suma") and 168 local&#13;
offices (Sumarija). HS is responsible for all works related to forest management, from regeneration to&#13;
selling roundwood at road side and, in some cases, transportation to the firms. Wood production is not&#13;
the only objective of HS activities: 0.5 million ha of forests and other forest land are managed for game&#13;
and, in some National Parks, HS is responsible for managing the forest area by applying strict criteria&#13;
of environmental protection. The HS's mandate also includes (i) supervision and general enforcement&#13;
of forest laws and regulations in non-State forests, although its employees do not operate as a police&#13;
corps; and (ii) training and extension to private and public organization outside the State enterprise;&#13;
however, this still represents a limited part in the HS's activities. Forest activities are carried out partly&#13;
by H§'s own work-force, which has decreased since 1991 to about 10,000 employees. As a result of H§&#13;
strategy to privatize non-core activities progressively, an increasing share of forest works is carried out&#13;
by private contractors (in 1994, they carried out 50% of silvicultural and road construction works, 40%&#13;
of felling, 53% of skidding, and 45% of log transport).&#13;
2.21   Other Ministries also have responsibilities in forestry at the national level:&#13;
* the Ministry of Science and Technology which controls and partly finances the two public&#13;
institutions dealing with R &amp; D in the sector: the Faculty of Forestry in Zagreb and the Forest&#13;
Research Institute in Jastrebarsko;&#13;
* the Ministry of Interior which has overall responsibility of forest fire control and collaborates&#13;
with the State enterprise HS in forest fire prevention and combat;&#13;
* the State Agency for the Conservation of Cultural and Natural Heritage (SACCNH) which is&#13;
responsible for nature protection in protected areas and has, in particular, authority over Croatia's&#13;
7 National Parks.&#13;
2.22   The Private sector. The private sector plays a modest role in forest management since private&#13;
forest land ownership is limited to some 458,000 ha. Production and self consumption of firewood are&#13;
the main objectives of the forestry activities carried out by private owners. The extremely large number&#13;
of private small landowners and the degraded structure of many private forests reduce the private sector's&#13;
political importance. The involvement of private enterprises in felling, harvesting and transport of logs&#13;
is steadily increasing. Enviromnental non-governmental organizations are emerging in a large number,&#13;
both at the national and local levels, but their lobbying power is still limited.&#13;
2.23   Fiscal and Financial Aspects of the Forestry Sector. It is very difficult to assess the fiscal&#13;
situation of the forestry sector during the recent years, because of disruptions caused by the war and&#13;
because of a changing tax system. Under current tax system, and taking into account the consequences&#13;
of the recent war, the situation appeared to be roughly balanced in 1994. Indeed, fiscal expenditure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
amounted to about Kunal2O million, including Kuna9O million corresponding to the fiscal transfer to HS&#13;
of the "0.07% tax on turnover" of Croatian companies, and an estimated Kuna3O million budgetary&#13;
contribution to forest administration (MAF), training and research (Ministry of Science and Technology),&#13;
and forest protection (SACCNH and protected areas). Fiscal income amounted also to about Kunal20&#13;
million, including direct fiscal transfers from the forest sector estimated at Kuna7O million (i.e., KunalO&#13;
million from profit taxes, Kuna3O million from service taxes, and Kuna 30 million from custom tariffs),&#13;
and an estimated KunaSO million contribution by HS (i.e., a KunalO million dividend returned to the&#13;
budget, and Kuna4O million for the salaries of HS staff serving in the Army). This situation is likely to&#13;
change dramatically into a positive balance in the near future with peace and with the introduction of the&#13;
VAT in 1997 which is expected to generate about Kuna200 million from the forestry sector.&#13;
2.24   The financial aspects of the forestry sector are mostly determined by those of Hrvatske Sume&#13;
(HS). The financial analysis of HS, presented in Annex E, shows that the enterprise has had a positive,&#13;
although decreasing, net income over the recent years. In 1995, revenues from wood production were&#13;
Kuna974 million (of which 99% were sales of forest products); revenue "generated" by the "0.07% tax&#13;
on industry turnover" were KunalOl million; the total cost of commercial and non-commercial activities&#13;
of HS was Kuna997 million, including Kuna418 million for salaries; the net income, after depreciation&#13;
and debt service, was Kunal8 million. It is not clear whether HS makes a significant profit out of&#13;
productive activities since its cost accounting system does not allow for a clear separation of commercial&#13;
from non-commercial activities. The financial analysis of HS also concludes that HS's financial structure&#13;
is sound. In June 1995, fixed assets represented 74% of total assets, and equity represented 88% of total&#13;
liabilities.&#13;
2.25    HS has maintained this positive financial situation in spite of serious difficulties caused by the&#13;
war (see para. 2.28), dividend contributions to the budget, difficult access to bank credit, and the&#13;
receivables from the wood industry which have decreased recently but are still important. This force-&#13;
majeure events, associated with increases in salary (mainly due to inflation) and overheads affected HS's&#13;
profitability and investment capabilities. The net income decreased from Kuna67 million in 1993 to the&#13;
above-mentioned Kunal8 million in 1995, and the operating cash flow decreased from 32% of sales in&#13;
1993 to 13 % at mid-1995. However, this trend is expected to reverse in the near future, since wood sales&#13;
should grow thanks to the recent recovery of the productive forests of formerly occupied territories and&#13;
sale prices should increase with the overall improvement in the domestic economy. Moreover, the&#13;
management of Hg has identified several actions to restore the enterprise's profitability: (i) speeding-up&#13;
the privatization program for non-core activities; (ii) reducing the number of Hg administrative staff; (iii)&#13;
improving the wood selling system; (iv) improving the accounting system of HS; and (v) addressing the&#13;
problem of receivables. The project would provide Hg with technical assistance for the implementation&#13;
of some of these initiatives.&#13;
2.26   Policy Issues. Most of the main policy issues facing the forestry sector in Croatia are being&#13;
addressed progressively by the Government. The problem of restitution of non-State forest land, which&#13;
used to be managed by the State, to their owners has been solved in most of the cases; the only pending&#13;
problem relates to land formerly owned by the Roman Catholic Church, which is being solved.&#13;
Privatization of forest works in State forests is a clear objective of the National Forest Policy (NFP)&#13;
which HS is implementing progressively; the proposed project would help HS speed-up and better&#13;
organize this process. Privatization of the wood industry is a far more difficult problem and is moving&#13;
slowly; the process is expected to benefit from the overall framework set up under the Financial Sector&#13;
Adjustment Loan (EFSAL). Improving the pricing system of roundwood is also an objective of the NFP;&#13;
the present system is affecting wood prices to a limited extent only, and the cautious approach taken by&#13;
the Government to further improve it should be considered as acceptable in the ongoing transition of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
wood industry. Most of the institutional issues in the forestry sector have been addressed with the&#13;
creation of HS, for which only limited organizational improvements would be supported by the project.&#13;
B. Impacts of the War&#13;
2.27   Croatia's forestry sector in general, and Hrvatske Sume (HS) in particular, have been seriously&#13;
affected by the recent war. Damage caused to forests has been assessed outside the territories that have&#13;
been occupied for four years; in the latter -- about 30% of the forest land -- war damage is still being&#13;
assessed. An estimated 100,000 ha of forests are affected by mine fields; in forest areas affected by&#13;
shelling and other war activities, about 15,000 ha have been completely destroyed, of which 11,000 ha&#13;
in coastal areas. The war has also severely impacted on wildlife, either because of minefields or&#13;
increasing and uncontrolled poaching; red deer, roe deer, and chamois populations are reported to be&#13;
strongly affected in general, while bear populations have declined as much as 50% in some areas. The&#13;
wood industry has also suffered significantly from the war, mostly because of the disruption of wood&#13;
supply from and the loss of markets in the occupied territories.&#13;
2.28   The war took a heavy toll on HS: 60 of its employees have been killed and 75 have been&#13;
seriously wounded and are invalid; about 40% of HS's workers were drafted in the Army while still paid&#13;
by HS; HS had also to contribute in equipment to the Army; and H§ lost significant revenues from&#13;
productive forests in occupied territories. The total losses of Ht because of the war are an estimated&#13;
US$75 million of which 15% are destroyed infrastructures (i.e. buildings, nurseries, roads, bridges, and&#13;
other field facilities), 70% are lost or destroyed equipment (i.e. cars, trucks, harvesting equipment, office&#13;
and other equipment), and 15% are other financial losses. Since 1993, H§ has started a reconstruction&#13;
effort with its own financial resources and, at the end of 1995 recovered 25% of the total losses; this&#13;
effort deals with infrastructures and equipment mainly; less than 5% of the forest area affected by&#13;
minefields has been cleaned; no reconstruction of destroyed forests has yet started.&#13;
C. The Project Area&#13;
2.29   The project would concentrate on the coastal and island forests of Croatia, with a focus on&#13;
Dalmatia, where urgent action is needed. Indeed, coastal forests are key assets for the restoration of&#13;
tourism in Croatia which is much wanted by the Government; they need immediate attention further to&#13;
recent war activities and efficient protection from fire; investment in coastal forest reconstruction and&#13;
protection would be well received by the local population and economic operators.&#13;
2.30   Economic and Social Features. The population of Dalmatia was estimated to be 1.4 million&#13;
before the war, with important population centers such as Zadar, Split, and Dubrovnik. The local&#13;
economy of Dalmatia is based primarily on tourism. Prior to 1991, tourism was Croatia's most important&#13;
source of foreign exchange. In 1989 and 1990, tourism accounted for about 7 percent of GDP with about&#13;
60 million tourist overnights a year. An estimated 92 percent of tourism income was generated on the&#13;
Adriatic coast. About 95 percent of all hotel beds are found on the coast; 34 percent are in Dalmatia.&#13;
Tourists on the coast spend an average of about 7 days in the country, while tourists in other areas spend&#13;
an average of less than two days.&#13;
2.31   The war situation has resulted in a drastic drop in income from tourism. In 1991, income from&#13;
tourism was less than 14 percent of that in the previous years, accounting for less than 2 percent of a&#13;
substantially reduced GDP. By 1994, income from tourism was still at only about 35 percent of pre-war&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
levels. Even this limited recovery has been very uneven, however. Of the roughly 20 million tourist&#13;
overnights in 1994, over half were in Istria, where the tourist presence was about half its pre-war&#13;
average. In Dalmatia, on the other hand, the number of tourist overnights was less than 10 percent of&#13;
its pre-war levels.&#13;
2.32   In terms of agriculture, the Mediterranean agro-ecological zone has never been considered very&#13;
important due to its topography and relatively poor soils. Outside of specific wine-growing regions, which&#13;
continue to thrive, agriculture and livestock have become less important to the Dalmatian economy over&#13;
the past years as more local inhabitants have become involved in tourism activities due to growth in this&#13;
sector. This trend appears to be continuing, despite the recent collapse of the tourism sector, and there&#13;
is general optimism that the economy will recover. Nevertheless, livestock grazing still exists in most&#13;
areas, albeit to a limited extent. Fishing is relatively important to the economy of the coastal zone of&#13;
Croatia, given the extensive coastline (5,790 km including the islands). Employment from fishing in 1993&#13;
was officially estimated at 1,600 for the entire coast, but other estimates place the number at 2,500&#13;
full-time fishermen, with a further 10,000 people fishing part-time, both for recreation and supplementary&#13;
income.&#13;
2.33   Coastal Forests. Coastal and island forests cover 580,000 ha, including 60,000 ha of high forest,&#13;
190,000 ha of coppice, and 330,000 ha of scrub and maquis. Coastal forests (Istria peninsula and&#13;
Dalmatia) include the following two main types: (i) Mediterranean forests, closest to the sea, that consist&#13;
mainly of holm oak (Quercus ilex) and Aleppo pine (Q. halepensis), with also cluster pine (P. pinaster),&#13;
Italian stone pine (P. pinea), and Italian cypress (Cupressus sempervirens); and (ii) sub-Mediterranean&#13;
forests that consist mainly of pubescent oak (Q. pubescens) and black pine (P. nigra). Since the Roman&#13;
time, these forests have been under intense human pressure for timber, fuel, and grazing, resulting in&#13;
large areas dominated by coppices, maquis, garrigue, stony pastures or bare karst. Compared with the&#13;
inland, the coastal forests are considerably less stocked; only about 50 m3s ob/ha which is 42 percent of&#13;
the average for all forest land in Croatia. The average annual growth is only 1.5 m3s ob/ha, compared&#13;
with 4.4 for all HS managed forests.&#13;
2.34   Coastal forests of Croatia, the Mediterranean type in particular, deserve immediate attention and&#13;
assistance. Indeed, in addition to being the most affected by recent war activities, they have been&#13;
neglected in the past, in comparison with inland forests, in terms of protection and management. They&#13;
are also most sensitive to fire, mostly of human origin, that ravage a significant area every year. At the&#13;
same time the coastal forests are a vital asset for the restoration of the tourist industry, which is by far&#13;
the dominating source of income in this part of the country.&#13;
2.35   Forest Fires. Forest fires represent the greatest danger for coastal and island forests of Croatia.&#13;
They have a very high probability of occurrence, they cause considerable damage, and they are very&#13;
difficult to control with the present fire-fighting organization and equipment. Available records on coastal&#13;
forest fires in Croatia from 1973 to 1994 show that, in spite of a fairly stable number of fires over the&#13;
years, the area burned has increased tremendously. During that period, 4,600 fires have occurred in&#13;
which 190,000 ha of forests and forest land were burned, and the annual average area destroyed by fire&#13;
was 8,600 ha. The number of fires was about 200 fires per year, but the total area burned annually has&#13;
doubled over the past 15 years (i.e., from 5,500 to 12,000 ha) and reached an annual area burnt of 21&#13;
ha per 1,000 ha of forest; the area burned per fire has increased from 26 to 62 ha. These figures are&#13;
among the highest when compared with similar data from countries with Mediterranean forests facing&#13;
similar problems such as Spain, France, Italy, and Greece: the annual area burnt per 1,000 ha ranges&#13;
from 7 ha in France to 20 ha in Italy; the area burnt per fire ranges from 8 ha in France to 36 ha in&#13;
Greece.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
2.36   As regards forest types, statistics show that coppices burn 2.5 times less than the average, other&#13;
forests (garrigue and maquis) twice more than the average, and high forests roughly as much as the&#13;
average. As regards species, broadleaves appear to be about 3 times more fire resistant than conifers.&#13;
A high amount of wood mass makes it more difficult to combat fires. The average area burned increases&#13;
with crown cover or density: from about 30 ha/fire for stands with less than 50% cover, to 140 ha/fire&#13;
for stands with 100% cover.&#13;
2.37   The main results from various studies on the causes of forest fires show that: more than 95% of&#13;
fires are caused by human action, most of which is negligence on the part of farmers, tourists, and&#13;
facilities managers; about 40% of the total number of fires are caused by agriculture operations, while&#13;
other important causes include cigarette butts, at roadside in particular, municipal dumps, railways, and&#13;
power lines. However, during the 1991-1993 period, the most frequent cause of forest fires was enemy&#13;
shells in the hinterland of the Dalmatian towns of Dubrovnik, Sibenik, Split, and Zadar, which in 1992&#13;
alone caused 57 fires in this region.&#13;
2.38   Available statistics show that there are clear high risk periods for forest fires, which gives good&#13;
indications on when to concentrate specific actions for increased fire control effectiveness and cost&#13;
efficiency. In terms of number of fires, there is a great difference between the northern coast (in Istria&#13;
and Primorje, 70% of fires start in February, March or April) and the southern coast (in Dalmatia, 70%&#13;
of fires start in July or August). In terms of areas burned, the period of peak fire-risk is also July and&#13;
August for the whole coast, which corresponds to the two hottest and driest months of the year (with&#13;
more than 90% of fire damage). In 1994, three quarters of all fires started in the middle of the day,&#13;
between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., and two thirds between 12 p.m. and 5 p.m., during the hottest hours of the&#13;
day. As regards weather, the two primary parameters which influence forest fires are dryness (in&#13;
particular the moisture content of dead fine fuels) and wind speed: flammability (relating to the number&#13;
of fires) is conditioned by dryness, while fire intensity (relating to the area burned) increases with wind&#13;
speed. After several months of drought in the summnertime, the fire danger depends primarily on the&#13;
wind. Thus, windy days deserve particular attention during the peak fire-risk period (e.g., in 1994, 60%&#13;
of the total area burned was burned within only one windy week).&#13;
2.39   There are also high risk areas for forest fires. It is clear that the coastal region is by far the most&#13;
fire sensitive part of Croatia (about 95 % of the total burned area in the country in average). Risks of&#13;
forest fire on the coast go with the following two gradients: (i) a "South to North" gradient, which means&#13;
that fires are more numerous in the southern than in the northern part of the Adriatic coast (about 75 %&#13;
of the total area burned annually is in Dalmatia); and (ii) a "Sea to Inland" gradient, which means that&#13;
the majority of forest fires and most areas burned (90%) occur in a thin strip along the coast at an altitude&#13;
of less than 400 m.&#13;
2.40   Prior to independence, forestfire control was far from adequate which was partly the reason for&#13;
the high number of forest fires and the high amount of burned areas. Prevention was very weak;&#13;
measures to raise public awareness of forest fire problems were minimal; and silvicultural measures&#13;
designed to reduce the likelihood and incidence of fires were inadequately implemented. Pre-suppression&#13;
was also weak: firebreaks were rare and often poorly maintained, and none incorporated access roads for&#13;
fire-fighters; the network of observation posts for fire detection was inadequate; and the communication&#13;
system was poor and based on mostly outdated equipment. Fire-fighting forces were not coordinated&#13;
properly: aerial fire-fighting, with 4 seaplane air-tankers (CL 215), was under the control of the&#13;
ex-Yugoslavian Army while professional fire brigades were under the authority of local municipalities.&#13;
Fire-fighting became an impossible task during the recent war period because of disruption in the pre-war&#13;
period (in 1990), large fires caused by incendiary bombs (in 1991), lack of equipment (the 4 seaplane air-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
tankers were withdrawn from Croatia by the ex-Yugoslavian Army), and the impossibility to fight fires&#13;
in areas with mine fields.&#13;
2.41   Since the establishment of the Republic of Croatia in 1990, there has been a substantial&#13;
improvement in the organization of forest fire management. Protective measures have been incorporated&#13;
into forest management plans and fire-fighting forces coordinated under the Ministry of the Interior&#13;
(Mol). The latter has developed, and is beginning to implement, a comprehensive strategy -- similar to&#13;
strategies for Mediterranean forest fire management adopted in Spain, France, and Italy -- that combines&#13;
measures to (i) reduce the number of fires through better prevention, (ii) increase the efficiency of fire&#13;
control under high risk conditions with a better evaluation of fire risks and improved detection, and (iii)&#13;
reduce initial attack time and improve fire-fighting with better coordination and increased efficiency of&#13;
terrestrial and aerial fire-fighting. The latter is a strong element of MoI's strategy which aims at&#13;
restoring a meaningful fleet of seaplane air-tankers. Indeed, given Croatia's long coastline (close to 6,000&#13;
km including the islands) and the narrowness of the area vulnerable to forest fires (5-10 km on average),&#13;
the use of seaplane air-tankers with the capability of refilling their tanks by scooping up seawater provides&#13;
the most viable option for aerial fire-fighting. Only two types of aircraft which satisfy this requirement&#13;
are available on the market at this stage: the Canadair CL 415 and its predecessor, the Canadair CL 215;&#13;
however, another seaplane air-tanker, which would compete with the CL 415, is currently under&#13;
development. As a first step in implementing its strategy, the Mol has hired and subsequently purchased&#13;
2 second hand air-tankers (CL 215). Because of limited resources and the war situation, however, much&#13;
remains to be done to make Mol's strategy fully operational.&#13;
2.42   Participation of Populations in Forest Reconstruction and Protection. In general the response&#13;
to planned project activities is very favorable. The University of Zagreb has carried out a sociological&#13;
analysis of opinions of the inhabitants in the project area based on interviews during September 1995.&#13;
A total of 280 people were interviewed from Senj, Zadar, Sibenik/Split and Dubrovnik. The respondents&#13;
were taken from a stratified sample in four groups; landowners, tourist workers, livestock owners and&#13;
other citizens. All sexes, ages and schooling levels were represented in the study. The results are&#13;
presented in a separate study, but some of the highlights are interesting: 25 percent were not interested&#13;
in utilizing the wood from the forests; 92 percent felt that reforesting is the right thing to do when a&#13;
forest has been burned; cluster pine (Pinus pinaster) is the most popular species to be planted (20&#13;
percent), twice as many favored this pine as any other species; poplars is the most unpopular tree species&#13;
(16 percent); environmental protection and erosion protection are the absolutely dominating purposes of&#13;
forests according to the respondents; 91 percent considered planting seedlings being the best way to&#13;
reforest; only 6 percent stated that they would not participate in forest fire protection; 77 percent were&#13;
willing to join volunteer fire brigades; 83 percent declared themselves willing to build a fire break over&#13;
their own land without compensation; and 89 percent wanted to have qualified personnel if they would&#13;
plant on their own land, while only 0.7 percent considered doing it themselves.&#13;
D. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
2.43   The World Bank would support the proposed project, as a priority reconstruction activity, which&#13;
should facilitate the restarting of tourism along the Dalmatian coast, restoring economic activity in a&#13;
larger sense. Reconstructing coastal forests destroyed by the war and protecting existing coastal forests&#13;
from fire are key elements to restore and maintain an attractive landscape in touristic areas. Unless the&#13;
visible consequences of the war on coastal landscape is removed, the income potential from tourism will&#13;
not be utilized to its full potential. Within the sector, coastal forests also have high priority since (i) the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
overall policy framework for the sector, in the ongoing transition, is satisfactory; and (ii) the problems&#13;
of inland forestry are adequately being addressed by the Government with its own resources.&#13;
2.44   The Government needs the assistance of the World Bank to reach the above goals since the&#13;
financial and institutional resources of HS are not sufficient to maintain the high standards of inland forest&#13;
management while coping with the backlog of investments and the aftermath of serious war damages&#13;
alongside the Dalmatian coast. Moreover, due to the effects of the war, the budgetary allocation to the&#13;
Ministry of Interior for fire control in coastal areas is insufficient to establish an essential fire control&#13;
system, unless additional financial resources are provided. Assistance from international sources has not&#13;
been forthcoming to the extent required. World Bank intervention in the project would (a) provide&#13;
investment capital that is directly needed; (b) extend the ongoing Bank support to the reconstruction of&#13;
Croatia under the Emergency Reconstruction Project; and (c) result in increased confidence by other&#13;
donors in assisting Croatia.&#13;
2.45   The project would be consistent with the World Bank forest policy paper, since it is clearly&#13;
environmentally protective in a country where the Government is also committed to sustainable and&#13;
conservation-oriented forestry. The project is part of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS).&#13;
Indeed, the project is identified as one element of the CAS policy objective to rebuild and upgrade war-&#13;
damaged infrastructure. The project is also consistent with the special Bank emphasis on the environment&#13;
highlighted by the CAS, namely it "would be part of a longer-term program to restore and maintain&#13;
favorable ecological conditions in coastal areas in support of tourism. "&#13;
&#13;

CHAPTER III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives and Summary Description&#13;
3.1    Project Objectives. The main objective of the project is to restore and protect forest land in the&#13;
coastal zone of Croatia in order to enhance landscape and recreation values of the region and thereby&#13;
contribute to restore tourism to its pre-war level. Other objectives related to the project's main objective&#13;
are to (i) restore the environmental role of coastal forests destroyed by the war, by protecting soils and&#13;
waters, and initiate the restoration of the natural vegetation; (ii) address the problem of forest fire that&#13;
is a crucial threat to coastal areas; and (iii) develop the knowledge base for improved management and&#13;
protection of coastal forests.&#13;
3.2    Summary Description.  The project, to be implemented over 5 years, would include the&#13;
following 3 components: (i) reconstruction of coastal forests destroyed by war activities including the&#13;
rehabilitation of about 5,800 ha of forests, and the reconstruction of one nursery and one arboretum; (ii)&#13;
forest fire management in coastal areas including a comprehensive package of prevention, pre-&#13;
suppression, and suppression measures; and (iii) support services including the development of a GIS for&#13;
forest fire management, research in coastal forestry, institutional support to Hrvatske Sume (HS) and the&#13;
Ministry of Interior (Mol), and project management and monitoring.&#13;
B. Detailed Features&#13;
Coastal Forest Reconstruction (US$11.9 million')&#13;
3.3    Rehabilitation of Coastal Forests (US$9.5 million). The project would support the rehabilitation&#13;
of forests affected by war activities along the coast of Croatia, from Senj (Primorje) to Dubrovnik&#13;
(Southern Dalmatia). Rehabilitation activities include, first, the reconstruction of 5,000 ha from the&#13;
11,000 ha of forests destroyed, in 1991 and 1992, by fires caused mostly directly by incendiary bombs&#13;
and rocket attacks or indirectly by other war activities. Forest reconstruction would start with clearing&#13;
destroyed stands of burned trees, over about 80% of the area, and would continue with reforestation with&#13;
mostly indigenous species. Rehabilitation would also include silvicultural interventions in 800 ha of&#13;
young stands in areas affected by war destruction: cleaning of young stands that have regenerated&#13;
naturally after the fire, or thinning of young stands that have survived the fire.&#13;
3.4    Rehabilitation activities would be carried out in areas selected for their strong touristic and&#13;
environmental significance, sometimes combined with wood production potential. Reforestation would&#13;
be carried out mostly on State land (4,500 ha), but also on private land (500 ha), since the latter represent&#13;
about 10%  of forest land in the project area.  Among the 20 sites initially proposed by HS for&#13;
rehabilitation of forests on State land, 10 sites (or 1,250 ha for forest reconstruction and 700 ha for&#13;
silvicultural interventions) with proven benefits have been selected for initial project implementation,&#13;
based on the economic analysis of the component (see Annex J). Rehabilitation works have been planned&#13;
in detail by HS for these sites. During the first year of the project, together with local authorities and&#13;
representatives of the Ministry of Tourism, HS would select additional sites for reforestation on State land&#13;
and identify the areas where private owners would be eligible to project support. Selection criteria are&#13;
IJ  Component costs shown include physical and price contingencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
derived from the economic analysis of the project (see Annex J); they are based on landscape value --&#13;
measured by the size of the landscape affected by forest fires and the number of tourists -- and the&#13;
economic cost of forest reconstruction.&#13;
3.5    Project supported reforestation is designed to allow for the return of the native climacic forest&#13;
communities after one rotation, on the basis of past research efforts to reintroduce trees in the karst&#13;
region. In each site, a mixture of mostly indigenous Mediterranean coniferous species would be selected&#13;
on the basis of their adaptability to local harsh and sometime degraded conditions, their capacity to serve&#13;
as cover crops for indigenous oaks to regenerate, their value as shade and landscaping trees in the vicinity&#13;
of tourism facilities, and their potential resistance to fire. Selected indigenous species would be pines (P.&#13;
halepensis, pinea, pinaster, and nigra) and cypress (C. sempervirens); few exotic species, such as Cedrus&#13;
atlantica. would be used in a small amount mostly for their landscape value.  Based on the&#13;
recommendations of the environmental review of the project, selected indigenous broadleaf species (e.g.,&#13;
Fraxinus ornus and Ostrya carpinigolia) would also be planted, in mixture with coniferous species, in&#13;
sites where this is technically feasible (e.g., in the Dubrovnik area); broadleaves plantation would be&#13;
extended to other sites, based on the results of relevant research activities funded under the project.&#13;
3.6    The best planting stock would be used in reforestation. Seeds would be collected only from&#13;
known and registered sources, and containerized seedlings would be used in order to maximize survival&#13;
and initial growth under the dry conditions of project area. Soil preparation before planting would be&#13;
done either mechanically by ripping (2,000 ha on State land) or manually (2,500 ha on State land, and&#13;
500 ha on private land), depending on the site conditions. The standard planting density would be 3 m&#13;
by 3 m or 1,111 seedlings per ha; planting would take place in late fall or early winter, after the first&#13;
rains; tending of plantations would start in spring and last over 3 years. The average unit costs per ha&#13;
for reforestation activities would be US$340 for clearing sites of burned trees, US$1,270 for planting with&#13;
ripping, and US$1,110 for planting with manual soil preparation.&#13;
3.7    HS would be responsible for rehabilitation of forests on State land. Reforestation on private land&#13;
would be done by the private owner, with the technical assistance of HS and under the control of the&#13;
Zupanija Forestry Inspector, under a contract between the owner and HS. The model for this contract&#13;
(see Annex F) has been agreed upon by HS, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) and the&#13;
Bank. Reforestation works would be funded with a State capital grant which would be channeled to the&#13;
beneficiary through the "Fund for Biological Reproduction in Private Forest" currently administered by&#13;
HS. It was agreed that the capital grant would be US$1,400 per ha, which corresponds to the total cost&#13;
of manual planting of Italian stone pine (Pinus pinea). The private owner would have the option to plant&#13;
more expensive fruit crops but the capital grant would remain the same as such crops will give earlier&#13;
returns.&#13;
3.8    Reconstruction of a Nursery in Zadar (US$2.2 million). The project would support the&#13;
construction of a new nursery to replace the nursery of Crno, in the vicinity of Zadar, that has been&#13;
completely destroyed during the fighting around that city in 1991. The site of Piket, close to the airport&#13;
of Zadar, has been selected by HS with the agreement of the MAF; the latter undertook to transfer to the&#13;
former the State-owned agriculture land that is necessary to establish the nursery. The nursery would&#13;
be established as a modern production unit, with an annual capacity of 1 million containerized seedlings;&#13;
the nursery would only grow seedlings of species utilized in reforestation programs in the coastal areas.&#13;
The project would fund (i) the construction of the access roads, the building of the nursery, and the water&#13;
supply system; (ii) the establishment of the area to grow containerized seedlings; and (iii) the modern&#13;
equipment and machinery needed for the new nursery.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
3.9    Reconstruction of the Arboretum in Trsteno (US$0.2 million). The project would also support&#13;
the reconstruction of the arboretum in Trsteno, close to Dubrovnik. This arboretum is one of the most&#13;
ancient in the world, since it has been established in the 15th century, and contains a wealth of indigenous&#13;
and exotic species; it was badly damaged by fire during the war activities around Dubrovnik in late 1991&#13;
and early 1992. The project would fund the replacement of the main water supply line, the reopening&#13;
of the firebreaks around the garden, the replacement of some critical machinery, and green house&#13;
rehabilitation.&#13;
Forest Fire Management (US$47.9 million)&#13;
3.10   The project would provide major improvement to the existing system of fire management for&#13;
coastal forests of Croatia, by enhancing the capability for fire-fighting as well as fire prevention, and&#13;
thereby reduce the area of forests burned each year. The project would support the comprehensive forest&#13;
fire management strategy developed by the Government which aims at (i) increasing the resistance of&#13;
forest stands to fire; (ii) reducing the number of fires; (iii) reducing initial attack time, and improving&#13;
fire-fighting capacity; and (iv) increasing the efficiency of fire-fighting under high risk conditions. The&#13;
proposed strategy includes a comprehensive package of prevention, pre-suppression, and suppression&#13;
activities that are presented in the Table 3.1 below.&#13;

Terrestrial Fire-Fighting&#13;
3.11   The proposed blend of prevention, pre-suppression, and suppression activities is designed to&#13;
complement the existing forest fire management capacity into a system with the highest cost-effectiveness.&#13;
It is also designed to fit local conditions in terms of (i) physical environment (i.e. Mediterranean forests&#13;
located on a long coast and in many islands); (ii) fire-fighting methods (i.e. strong reliance on aerial fire-&#13;
fighting with seaplane air-tankers capable of scooping-up seawater, in combination with terrestrial fire-&#13;
fighting); and (iii) current fire detection and fire-fighting arrangements involving local services of the MoI&#13;
and of H§, the Municipalities, and professional and volunteer fire-brigades. The proposed sharing of&#13;
project funding for prevention, pre-suppression, and suppression is similar to current distribution of&#13;
funding for forest fire management in other countries with Mediterranean forests facing the same problem&#13;
as Croatia. However, the relative share of prevention under the project is higher than usual given the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
fact that the project would fund exceptional reconstruction investments for pre-suppression and&#13;
suppression.&#13;
3.12   Prevention (US$3.3 million). Forest fire prevention is essential in the proposed forest fire&#13;
management strategy, since suppression activities alone could not address the problem of forest fires in&#13;
coastal Croatia. Proposed prevention activities aim at reducing the number of fires and increasing the&#13;
resistance of forests to fires, once they have started. The project would assist in the following:&#13;
(i)    Action towards Populations. Since most of the fires are caused by the rural population during&#13;
agricultural and forest operations, and tourists during the summer period, the project would&#13;
support specific actions to alert these two groups to the damage of forest fires.  Indeed,&#13;
experience in other Mediterranean countries has shown that action towards populations needs to&#13;
be clearly targeted to be efficient. Each of these groups would be approached in a specific way&#13;
in order to raise their level of attention to the problem of fires, develop a stronger sense of&#13;
personal responsibility, and a better information on legal limitations and appropriate ways of&#13;
using and controlling fire. The approach would be informative, educational, and one which&#13;
appeals. However, the funding of this activity has been dimensioned (i.e., about one third of&#13;
prevention costs) knowing that actions towards populations become less successful when the risk&#13;
of fire increases. The project would fund the development and distribution of the following: (i)&#13;
targeted letters, video material, and radio messages for farmers; and (ii) brochures, video&#13;
material, posters, and radio messages in foreign languages for tourists in the summer;&#13;
(ii)    Roadside Forests Cleaning. Since many accidental fires start on roadside, the project would&#13;
support increased vegetation cleaning (removal of the flammable undergrowth and pruning of the&#13;
lower branches of trees on a 25m-wide strip) in forests bordering roads with significant traffic.&#13;
This would contribute to reducing the number of fires and increasing the resistance of roadside&#13;
forests to fires. The project would fund cleaning over 560 ha of roadside forests identified by&#13;
HS, corresponding to about 150 km of roads; this would be additional to a minimum program&#13;
which HS would carry out anyway without the project;&#13;
(iii)   Thinning. The project would contribute to reducing the amount of flammable material in pine&#13;
stands in high risk locations, in order to increase their resistance to fire. The project would fund&#13;
thinning and pruning of lower branches over 1,200 ha in sensitive areas identified by HS; this&#13;
would also be additional to a minimum program which Hs would carry out anyway without the&#13;
project.&#13;
3.13   Pre-Suppression (US$6.2 million). Pre-suppression activities supported by the project would&#13;
considerably improve the capacity to forecast the occurrence of forest fires, to detect forest fires as soon&#13;
as they have started, and to access burning areas for further terrestrial fire-fighting. The project would&#13;
assist in the following:&#13;
(i)    Weather Forecast System. The project would support the reconstruction of an efficient "fire&#13;
weather forecast system" that would allow for advanced and accurate forecast of dryness and&#13;
wind mainly, and would be essential to develop a special strategy for forest fire management&#13;
during the high risk period. The project would help establish a network linking meteorological&#13;
stations on the coast and on the islands, by funding meteorological, telecommunication, computer&#13;
equipment, and relevant training;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
(ii)   Improved Detection. The project would fund a package of measures to ensure early detection&#13;
of and reaction to forest fires (i.e., a maximum of 10 minutes in average after it has started).&#13;
Four new lookout towers would be established to complement the existing network of 16 towers;&#13;
lookout equipment would be provided for these 4 additional towers and for 20 additional lookout&#13;
points that would be operated during the high risk period. The project would also fund, from&#13;
the Government contribution, the observers operating the lookout towers and points, and the&#13;
additional patrols needed during the high risk period;&#13;
(iv)   Fire-Fighting Roads. The project would complement the network of existing roads utilized for&#13;
forest fire-fighting in coastal areas: 500 km of fire-fighting roads would be established including&#13;
400 km within forest areas and 100 km outside forest areas. Fire-fighting roads would be sited&#13;
according to the following criteria: (a) altitude below 400 m, where the risks of fires are the&#13;
highest; (b) priority to areas with interface between open lands and forests, where most of the&#13;
fires start and where the chances to control them are the highest; (c) terrain slope below 40%,&#13;
where terrestrial fire-fighting is the most efficient; and (d) compliance with stream protection&#13;
requirements, as highlighted under the environmental review of the project. Fire-fighting roads&#13;
would be constructed according to standards -- addressing erosion and drainage concerns --&#13;
approved by the Bank.&#13;
3.14   Suppression (US$38.4 million). The project would support a major increase in the capacity to&#13;
combat forest fires -- when they have started -- in coastal Croatia, by funding the equipment necessary&#13;
for an efficient integration of terrestrial and aerial fire-fighting. The project would assist in the following:&#13;
(i)    Telecommunication System. The project would provide the minimum equipment necessary to&#13;
establish a comprehensive telecommunication system, in order to both reduce the initial attack&#13;
time and increase the efficiency of available fire-fighting forces. The system would be adapted&#13;
to local conditions and present fire detection and fire-fighting arrangements. The equipment&#13;
funded by the project would include diverse stationary (e.g. radio equipment for the Mol and HS&#13;
services in the 7 coastal Zupanija; "repeaters" for pagers) and mobile (e.g. radio equipment for&#13;
aircraft and vehicles, pagers) telecommunication equipment;&#13;
(ii)    Aerial Fire-Fighting. The project would support improved aerial fighting of forest fires in two&#13;
ways with:&#13;
(a)    the purchase of a new and modern seaplane air-tanker (indicative technical requirements&#13;
are presented in Appendix 1 to the Project Implementation Plan in Annex B) to&#13;
complement the existing 2 second hand seaplane air-tankers (CL 215). This would be&#13;
the central element of the forest fire management component (about 50 % of the total cost&#13;
of the latter) in order to increase fire-fighting capacity, and the essential step to provide&#13;
Croatia with a minimal, but meaningful, fleet of seaplane air-tankers;&#13;
(b)    the reconstruction of aircraft facilities (including one hangar for air-tankers, and the pilot&#13;
building) destroyed by the war in the airbase of Zemunik, near Zadar, which is central&#13;
to aerial fire-fighting; and the establishment of stand-by facilities in the airbases of Pula,&#13;
Split and Dubrovnik in order to facilitate aircraft operation and reduce initial attack time;&#13;
(iii)   Terrestrial Fire-Fighting. Twenty four fire brigades in the 7 coastal Zupanija would be provided&#13;
with the equipment necessary to bring their fire-fighting capacity up to acceptable standards. This&#13;
equipment would include 30 fire-fighting trucks adapted to forest fire conditions, and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
equipment and training necessary to establish 15 specialized teams of "smoke jumpers", that&#13;
would complement existing fire-fighting forces in inaccessible areas.&#13;
Support Services (US$7.5 million)&#13;
3.15   GIS for Fire-Fighting Operational Centers (US$1.8 million). A Geographic Information&#13;
System (GIS) -- including computer hardware, software, databases, and relevant training -- would be&#13;
developed and funded under the project in order to make the Operational Centers, established by the Mol,&#13;
more efficient for the overall and permanent operational control of forest fire management in Croatia.&#13;
The Operational Centers are supposed to collect and process current data about forest fires and the status&#13;
of fire-fighting capacities, and make immediate decisions to organize and coordinate forest fire-fighting&#13;
activities. They are organized into one "State Operational Center", in Zagreb, that coordinates 6 local&#13;
Operational Centers, the above-mentioned Weather Forecast System, and a forest fire Operational Center&#13;
located in HS. A workplan was agreed upon with the Mol, in which a dispatching system for fire-&#13;
fighting forces, necessary data on forest conditions, and models of fire hazards and fire development&#13;
would be developed in parallel, with the aim that a system would begin deployment to an initial group&#13;
of Operational Centers after two years, after a year of development and a year-long pilot test involving&#13;
a single Operational Center.&#13;
3.16   Research (US$4.4 million). The project would support research activities and testing of new&#13;
methods in order to improve the efficiency and technical quality of reforestation efforts and forest fire&#13;
management in the project area. These activities would focus on three main aspects. First, a forestry&#13;
research program would address key issues in coastal forestry that have been neglected so far. The&#13;
Forestry Research Institute (FRI) would be directly responsible for sub-programs on: breeding of the&#13;
Aleppo pine (P. halepensis), which is indeed a very important species for coastal forestry due to its&#13;
pioneering capability; establishing non-tree cover crops for site amelioration; nursery techniques; and fire&#13;
resistant species. The FRI would sub-contract the Forest Faculty at Zagreb University to carry out sub-&#13;
programs on: broadleaf and conifer silviculture; utilization of Aleppo pine; utilization of chipping debris;&#13;
and costing standards for plantation establishment. Second, the Mol would be responsible for carrying&#13;
out a specific research program for the development of the above GIS, including the assessment of the&#13;
risks for forest fires under the specific conditions of coastal Croatia, and the development of models of&#13;
fire hazards. Third, new methods of aerial fire-fighting would be tested by the Mol in order to further&#13;
reduce the initial attack time; a test with rented land-based initial attack air-planes would be conducted&#13;
over 3 years. The project would also fund the experimental utilization of foam and retardant in order&#13;
to improve the efficiency of fire-fighting with air-tankers.&#13;
3.17   Institutional Strengthening (US$0.5 million).  The project would help Hg restore its&#13;
profitability by funding technical assistance to (i) develop and adopt, by project mid-term review, an&#13;
efficient cost accounting system -- which would clearly separate commercial from non-commercial&#13;
activities -- together with the adoption of international accounting standards; (ii) develop a plan to&#13;
complete the ongoing privatization of non-core assets with a focus on assessing priority sectors for further&#13;
privatization, and suitable privatization timetable; and (iii) address human resources issues in relation with&#13;
the implementation of the privatization plan, and the necessary reduction in administrative staff. The&#13;
focus would be on supporting progressive transfer of employees from the public to the private sectors,&#13;
and on management training programs for former Hg employees who would establish themselves as new&#13;
entrepreneurs. Training and technical assistance would also be provided to Mol to (i) improve the&#13;
organization of field activities of forest fire pre-suppression and suppression in coastal zones of Croatia;&#13;
and (ii) help the Mol prepare technical specifications and bidding documents for the purchase of&#13;
specialized equipment (i.e., aircraft, meteorological and GIS equipment). This would include study tours&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
to countries and organizations facing problems similar to those in Croatia, and assistance from&#13;
international experts.&#13;
3.18   Project Management and Monitoring (US$0.7 million). The project would fund (i) the Project&#13;
Management Unit (PMU), that would be responsible for coordinating project implementation (see para.&#13;
4.5); and (ii) the project monitoring and evaluation system (see para. 4.11).&#13;
C. Project Costs and Financing&#13;
3.19   Project Costs.  The total project costs including contingencies are estimated at Kuna356.5&#13;
million (US$67.3 million). Project cost summary is presented in Table 3.2. Detailed project costs are&#13;
given in Annex A. The foreign exchange component is estimated at US$43.3 million, or about 64&#13;
percent of total project costs. Physical contingencies of 10 percent have been applied to all investment&#13;
and recurrent costs. Price contingencies have been estimated at 5 percent of the base costs2. Taxes and&#13;
duties amount to 13 percent of total project costs (US$8.7 million equivalent).&#13;

Note: Figures may not total exactly due to rounding.&#13;
3.20   Project Financing. Project financing would involve:&#13;
* the Government. A budgetary contribution of US$11 million, or 16 percent of total project&#13;
costs, is necessary to fund (i) reforestation on private land; (ii) local costs (including taxes) of&#13;
the reconstruction of the Trsteno arboretum and of project investments under the responsibility&#13;
of the Mol and MAF; and (iii) recurrent costs of project activities under the responsibility of the&#13;
Mol and MAF;&#13;
* the World Bank. The World Bank would be ready to consider a Multiple Currency Pool Loan&#13;
amounting to US$42 million equivalent, or 62 percent of total project costs. The World Bank&#13;
loan would fund all direct and indirect foreign costs of project investments net of taxes and&#13;
duties. A portion of the loan amount (US$7.5 million) would be passed through the Ministry of&#13;
Finance to HS to finance foreign costs of project activities under its financial responsibility. This&#13;
2/The price contingency calculation is based on projection of the Manufacturer's Unit Value Index for foreign costs (2.6% in&#13;
1996/97, 2.8% in 1997/98 and 1998/99, 2.9% in 1999/00 and 2000101), and projection of local inflation for local costs&#13;
(3.5% annual increase).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
portion of the loan would be repaid by Hs to the Ministry of Finance under a Subsidiary&#13;
Agreement that would be entered into between the Borrower and HS, on terms and conditions&#13;
satisfactory to the Borrower and the Bank; the signature of the Subsidiary Agreement would&#13;
condition the effectiveness of the loan;&#13;
* Hrvatske gume. HS's own resources, in the amount of US$14.3 million, would fund local costs&#13;
(including taxes) of investments, and recurrent costs for project activities for which HS is&#13;
financially responsible (i.e., the activities listed in Table 4.1, except for the reforestation on&#13;
private land and the reconstruction of the Trsteno arboretum that would be financed by the&#13;
budget). The participation of HS in project financing and repayment of the loan would be funded&#13;
out of the fiscal transfers made to HS (see paras. 2.18 and 2.24).&#13;
3.21   The respective share of the Government, the World Bank, and HS for each component is given&#13;
in Table 3.3 below.&#13;

D. Fiscal and Financial Sustainability&#13;
3.22   The present financial support from the State to coastal forests -- including budgetary allocation&#13;
to Mol, tax transfers channeled through HS and the Mol, and some transfer of HS's own commercial&#13;
resources from continental forests -- is constrained and permits only to finance the surveillance and&#13;
maintenance of existing forests and rudimentary forest fire control; it is not sufficient to invest in the&#13;
reconstruction of key forest areas destroyed by the war, and in the establishment of an efficient system&#13;
to protect coastal forests from fire hazards. The project would make it possible to overcome the financial&#13;
constraints of the present transition period, and finance necessary reconstruction and development&#13;
investments now. The project would also help develop sustained State financing of the protection of the&#13;
coastal forests in the future by (i) contributing to the generation of increased fiscal resources; and (ii)&#13;
helping HS address its current and temporary decrease in profitability.&#13;
3.23   Increased Fiscal Resources. The reconstruction of war ravaged touristic forest landscape and&#13;
the development of reassuring protection of coastal environment from fire hazards would participate in&#13;
restoring Croatia's tourism industry. It is difficult to predict the fiscal impact of the recovery of the&#13;
tourist sector, since the tax system is undergoing profound transformations. Indeed, tourism was largely&#13;
exempt from turnover taxes in the past, so that its contribution to fiscal income has been primarily&#13;
indirect, through income taxes paid by people employed in the sector. Beginning in 1997, tourism will&#13;
be subject to the VAT which is replacing turnover taxes. However, the tourism tax, which is levied on&#13;
hotel nights, gives an indication of the likely fiscal impact of the recovery of the tourist sector. At its&#13;
current average level of about 1.5DEM per night, the tax is generating about US$21 million. Once&#13;
tourism recovers to pre-war levels of about 60 million overnights, the tax will generate about US$64&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
million annually, an increase of over US$40 million from this tax alone. Such an increase would be&#13;
about 15 time the amount of incremental recurrent costs from project financed activities together with the&#13;
repayment of the Bank loan.&#13;
3.24  Improved Financial Situation of HI. The analysis of the financial situation of HS (see Annex&#13;
E) shows that the profitability of HS, which was significant in 1993, has decreased in 1994 and 1995,&#13;
and that the capacity of HS to invest is likely to be affected. However, this trend is temporary since the&#13;
financial situation of HS will improve with (i) peace (HS's participation in the military effort of the&#13;
country as well as the burden of the reconstruction effort will decrease rapidly); and (ii) the recuperation&#13;
of occupied territories (production from productive forests there will resume). In addition, the project&#13;
will help Hg address potential financial problems by providing technical assistance to improve its financial&#13;
management, and to plan the privatization of non-core activities.&#13;
E. Project Procurement Arrangements&#13;
3.25   Procurement under the project would be carried out in accordance with World Bank guidelines&#13;
(Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, January 1995). A Procurement Plan indicating the&#13;
main procurement packages financed under the project is in Annex B. Project procurement arrangements&#13;
are summarized in the Table 3.4 below and will be undertaken in the following manner.&#13;
3.26   Procurement of Works. The manual forest works on State land including reforestation of coastal&#13;
forests, thinning, and roadside forests cleaning -- aggregate financing amounting to US$1.4 million or&#13;
25 percent of loan-financed works -- would be done on Force Account (FA) by Hrvatske Sume (HS).&#13;
There are no contractors currently available to carry out this type of activity and HS has been judged to&#13;
be fully capable of carrying out these tasks by FA. Certification of the works done by HS would be&#13;
carried out by the State Forest Inspectorate in the MAF. The quality and performance of the work will&#13;
be monitored by the Forestry Research Institute (FRI) which is independent from H§. Cost and&#13;
production standards for the various work involved have been agreed upon and Bank disbursements will&#13;
be linked to the production of predetermined physical units, such as hectares of forest planted, thinned&#13;
or cleaned. The first year's average unit costs have been agreed upon during appraisal and will be&#13;
revised annually based on actual costs as determined by the new accounting system which will be&#13;
introduced as part of the technical assistance to HS.&#13;
3.27   Contracts for works other than manual forest works estimated at less than US$500,000 and more&#13;
than US$50,000 each -- aggregate financing amounting to US$3.0 million or 55 percent of loan-financed&#13;
works -- would be awarded on the basis of National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures satisfactory&#13;
to the Bank. NCB procedures would be utilized for the following works: large contracts for ripping in&#13;
reforestation works, establishment of fire-fighting roads, reconstruction of infrastructures in the nursery&#13;
in Piket, and establishment of stand-by facilities for airplanes.&#13;
3.28   The remaining 20 percent of Loan funded works would be procured according to the following&#13;
procedures:&#13;
* ICB for the reconstruction of aircraft facilities in Zemunik (financing amounting to US$0.72&#13;
million). The Bank's standard bidding documents would be used;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
* Minor Works (MW) estimated to cost less than US$50,000 per contract -- aggregate financing&#13;
amounting to US$0.4 million -- including ripping in reforestation works, reconstruction of&#13;
infrastructures in the arboretum of Trsteno, and construction of lookout towers. MW would also&#13;
be utilized for reforestation works on private land, for which the project would give a capital&#13;
grant through the "Fund for Biological Reproduction in Private Forest": land owners contracting&#13;
reforestation would use MW, and land owners carrying out these works with their own labor&#13;
would also use MW to procure small implements, seedlings, and other materials required. These&#13;
minor works will be procured under lump sum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of&#13;
quotations obtained from three qualified contractors in response to a written invitation. A basic&#13;
form of agreement acceptable to the Bank and the invitation shall include a detailed description&#13;
of works, including the required completion period, basic specifications, and relevant drawings,&#13;
where applicable. The award shall be made to the contractor who offers the lowest price&#13;
quotation for the required work, and who has the experience and resources to successfully&#13;
complete the contract.&#13;
3.29   Procurement of Goods. The purchase of a new seaplane air-tanker and spare parts (financing&#13;
amounting to US$24.1 million or about 57% of the loan and 70% of the loan-financed goods) will be&#13;
carried out through Limited International Bidding (LIB). At this stage, only two manufacturers are&#13;
expected to be able to meet the technical requirements of the fire-fighting air-tanker considered by the&#13;
project.   The purchase of equipment for the Forest Fire Management component -- i.e., the&#13;
telecommunication system,-fire-fighting trucks, field vehicles, and computer hardware and software for&#13;
the GIS sub-component -- would be carried out through International Competitive Bidding (ICB)&#13;
procedures (aggregate financing amounting to US$8.4 million or about 23% of loan-financed goods).&#13;
Contracts for goods estimated to cost US$300,000 or above would be procured through ICB. In the&#13;
evaluation and comparison of bids for equipment to be procured through ICB, Croatian manufacturers&#13;
would receive a domestic preference in bid in accordance with World Bank guidelines.&#13;
3.30   The remaining 7 percent of loan-financed goods would be in minor packages suitable for&#13;
procurement methods other than ICB as follows:&#13;
* International Shopping (IS) for goods estimated to cost less than US$300,000 per contract --&#13;
aggregate financing amounting to US$1.9 million -- such as specialized equipment including&#13;
nursery, meteorological, and scientific equipment, and foam and retardant for testing new&#13;
methods of aerial fire-fighting for the Coastal Forest Reconstruction, Forest Fire Management,&#13;
and Support Services components respectively. The IS method is based on comparison of at least&#13;
three quotations from suppliers in at least two eligible countries;&#13;
* National Shopping (NS) for goods estimated to cost less than US$50,000 per contract --&#13;
aggregate financing amounting to US$0.65 million -- including, PMU office furniture and&#13;
equipment, fertilizers, forest cleaning and thinning material and field equipment for the Forest&#13;
Research Institute. This method is based on comparison of at least three quotations from local&#13;
suppliers.&#13;
3.31   Procurement of Services. Contracts for services procured on a sole source basis --- aggregate&#13;
financing amounting to US$0.7 million -- would include: (i) forest research activities carried out by the&#13;
Forest Research Institute (FRI); and (ii) monitoring and evaluation of the project activities undertaken by&#13;
the FRI, the Croatia Ecological Society, and the Institute of Tourism. Contracts for other services&#13;
procured on a competitive basis -- aggregate financing amounting to US$1.5 million -- would include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
(i) renting land-based initial attack airplanes for testing new methods of aerial fire-fighting, under LIB&#13;
procedures; (ii) training and technical assistance provided to HS and Mol by qualified firms selected in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (August 1981); and (iii) consultant&#13;
services for the action towards populations sub-component and for GIS research activities provided by&#13;
local or international experts selected on the basis of a short list.&#13;
3.32   Retroactive Financing. Construction works for the aircraft facilities in Zemunik -- which are&#13;
needed prior to aircraft purchasing -- would be procured under ICB and would be financed retroactively&#13;
up to US$0.72 million, in accordance with the Bank's guidelines on retroactive financing.&#13;
3.33   Responsibilities. Procurement would be the responsibility of the Project Management Unit&#13;
(PMU), which would be established in the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (see para. 4.5), with&#13;
inputs from both MoI and HS for their respective areas of implementation. A positive assessment of the&#13;
capability of the borrower to carry out procurement procedures has been made. Their capabilities have&#13;
been strengthened through in-country training work shops, ongoing training and will be further&#13;
strengthened through support in Bank procurement during the implementation of the project and through&#13;
the use of standard bidding documents. A one-week project start-up seminar, focusing on project&#13;
implementation arrangements including procurement, will take place at the time of loan effectiveness,&#13;
tentatively planned for October 1996. A General Procurement Notice was published in the Development&#13;
Business in July 1996.&#13;
3.34   Procurement Review. The Bank would conduct a prior review of all ICB and LIB procurement&#13;
packages and the first two NCB, IS and NS packages. In addition, Bank's prior review will be required&#13;
for all Terms of Reference, sole-sourcing, specialized services and hiring procedures of consultants firms&#13;
above US$100,000 and individuals above US$50,000. Other contracts, including force account activities&#13;
under para. 3.26, would be subject to post reviews in accordance with Bank procedures. The Bank's&#13;
standard bidding documents will be used for ICB and NCB packages and for the recruitment of&#13;
consultants. Assurances on all procurement procedures have been obtained during negotiations.&#13;

3.37   Disbursements for reconstruction of coastal forests on private land would be made against&#13;
statements by the MAF certifying that reforestation work supported by the "Fund for Biological&#13;
Reproduction in Private Forest" is eligible to project funding. Evidence of expenditures made by land&#13;
owners for reforestation on private land would be retained by the MAF (State Forest Inspectorate) and&#13;
would be subject to World Bank review and approval.&#13;
3.38   A Special Account denominated in US Dollars would be established in a bank acceptable to the&#13;
World Bank under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. During the early stage of the project,&#13;
the initial allocation of the Special Account would be limited to a proposed US$1 million. However,&#13;
when the aggregate disbursement under the Loan would have reached the level of US$6 million, the&#13;
initial allocation would be increased up to a proposed US$2 million. The authorized allocations have&#13;
been agreed upon during the negotiations of the Loan. The Special Accounts would be administered and&#13;
replenished in accordance with Bank guidelines.&#13;
G. Environment Impact&#13;
3.39   Since the project has strong environmental focus and components, it has been given the&#13;
Environmental Category "B" designation: "Projects/Components Which May Have Specific&#13;
Environmental Impacts - More Limited Environmental Analysis Appropriate". The World Bank and the&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) agreed on the Terms of Reference for an Environmental&#13;
Review (ER) during the first Bank mission following project preparation. After reviewing a list of&#13;
possible institutions which would be capable of carrying out the ER, it was jointly decided by the MAF&#13;
and the World Bank mission that the Croatia Ecological Society (CES), an NGO group, was the most&#13;
appropriate institution to carry out the ER. The CES has carried out the ER during summer and early&#13;
fall 1995; the preliminary conclusions of the CES were discussed by the MAF, selected environimental&#13;
NGOs, and the Bank during project pre-appraisal in October 1995; and the CES sent a draft report to the&#13;
Bank in December 1995. The Bank has approved the conclusions made by CES, and has made particular&#13;
comments regarding the mitigation of some potentially negative effects of particular project activities.&#13;
During project appraisal, the conclusions of the ER and the comments by the Bank have been discussed&#13;
by the latter with the MAF, the Ministry of Interior, the State Agency for the Conservation of Cultural&#13;
and Natural Heritage, and the CES, and have been integrated in project design. Only the conclusions&#13;
made by CES are presented in Annex K.&#13;
3.40   CES concludes that the project would have an overall important and positive effect on the coastal&#13;
environment, in comparison of which the potentially negative impacts identified during the review would&#13;
be very small. As regards the latter, the main concerns raised by CES, together with the corresponding&#13;
mitigation measures now integrated in the project, are the following:&#13;
* the species composition in reforestation activities should include more broadleaves in order to&#13;
speed-up the re-establishment of the climacic vegetation; under the project, selected indigenous&#13;
broadleaf species (e.g., Fraxinus ornus and Ostrya carpinigolia)) would be planted, in mixture&#13;
with coniferous species, in sites where this is technically feasible (e.g., in the Dubrovnik area);&#13;
broadleaves plantation would be extended to other sites based on the results of relevant research&#13;
activities funded under the project;&#13;
* the use of fertilizers in reforestation activities may have negative impacts on the environment;&#13;
under the project, no fertilization will be done without a previous foliar analysis to determine the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
composition of the fertilizer that would be needed. Foliar analysis would be carried out if&#13;
plantations had an unhealthy aspect only, normally not before two years of age;&#13;
project activities may have adverse effects on coastal fresh water ecosystems; under the project,&#13;
no mechanical soil preparation or road building is to take place within 50 meters distance from&#13;
water-courses. Special attention would be given to spawning areas, based on a map detailing&#13;
sensitive spawning areas annexed to the ER.&#13;
3.41   The standards for the establishment of fire-fighting roads, which was a Bank concern before&#13;
appraisal, are considered acceptable by the latter and the CES, now that they include more detailed&#13;
indications on technical parameters for various site conditions (see Appendix 1 in Annex H). CES has&#13;
not identified the utiization of sea water to suppress forest fires as a serious environmental problem.&#13;
Indeed, forest soil will not be affected permanently since rains -- of which there is an adequate supply&#13;
during fall, winter and early spring -- will easily leach the salt from the soil. The probability that fire&#13;
suppression will be necessary again in the same forest is very small (if it does happen at least 10 years&#13;
will have elapsed). In addition, most Mediterranean species have adapted to the effect of salt in their&#13;
habitats. CES has also proposed a monitoring program on floral and faunal indicators, with a strong&#13;
emphasis on the latter, which is integrated in the overall project monitoring and evaluation system (see&#13;
para. 4.10).&#13;

CHAPTER IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Responsibilities and Management&#13;
4.1    The responsibilities for implementing project activities would be shared between (i) the Ministry&#13;
of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF), which would have overall responsibility over the project; (ii)&#13;
Hrvatske Sume (HS), as specified in the Project Agreement; and (iii) the Ministry of Interior (Mol),&#13;
which would be responsible for coordinating most of the Forest Fire Management component. Particular&#13;
project activities, mostly under the Support Services component, would be contracted either by HS or the&#13;
Mol to other Government agencies and to an NGO. Project management would be the responsibility of&#13;
MAF, with the support of a Project Steering Committee and a Project Management Unit.&#13;
4.2    Responsibilities. The responsibilities for implementing project activities would be shared between&#13;
HS and Mol according to Table 4.1 below.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
4.3    Project activities under the Forest Fire Management component would be implemented under&#13;
the overall organization of fire-fighting in Croatia for which the Mol has ultimate responsibility. Under&#13;
the aegis of the "National Committee for Fire Prevention and Control", the Mol is responsible for (i)&#13;
raising public awareness, in cooperation with municipalities and the Ministry of Education; (ii) forecasting&#13;
and detecting forest fires in cooperation, respectively, with the Meteorological and Hydrological Service&#13;
and with HS; and (iii) suppressing forest fires including aerial fire-fighting in cooperation with the Army,&#13;
and terrestrial fire-fighting (MoI professional fire brigades) in cooperation with municipalities (volunteer&#13;
fire brigades). The organization of fire-fighting under the Mol includes a command center in Zagreb with&#13;
a Chief Fire-Fighting Commander assisted with a "State Operational Center", and 7 regional centers, one&#13;
for each of the 7 coastal Zupanija, with a regional Fire-Fighting Commander assisted (in 6 Zupanija) with&#13;
a regional Operational Center.&#13;
4.4    Particular project activities would be carried out under particular agreements entered into, either&#13;
by HS or the Mol, with the following Government agencies and NGOs:&#13;
* the Academy of Sciences and Arts and HS would enter into an agreement for the reconstruction&#13;
of the arboretum in Trsteno;&#13;
* the Meteorological and Hydrological Service would enter into an agreement with the Mol to&#13;
operate the weather forecast system;&#13;
* the Forestry Research Institute (FRI) would enter into an agreement with Hg to carry out the&#13;
forestry research programs, and the FRI would enter into a sub-agreement with the University&#13;
of Zagreb for the research activities to be carried out by the latter; these agreements would&#13;
include provisions regarding the purchase and utilization of equipment and contracts for the&#13;
provision of services;&#13;
* the FRI, the Croatia Ecological Society, and the Institute of Tourism would be contracted by the&#13;
MAF to carry out the project monitoring and evaluation program.&#13;
At negotiations, it was agreed that agreements and terms of reference for the above activities would be&#13;
acceptable to the World Bank.&#13;
4.5    Project Management. Project management would be the overall responsibility of the MAF with&#13;
the support of:&#13;
* a Project Steering Committee, chaired by the MAF, that would be composed of four members:&#13;
the Vice-Minister of International Relations (MAF), the Vice-Minister of Forestry (MAF), the&#13;
Director General of HS, and the Director of the Fire and Explosives Prevention Department&#13;
(Mol). The Steering Committee would be responsible for the approval of the annual project&#13;
work program and budget prepared by the PMU, quarterly reviews of implementation and&#13;
approval of budget adjustments proposed by the PMU, overall monitoring of project execution,&#13;
and assistance in resolving evolving problems. Project effectiveness would be contingent upon&#13;
actual appointment of the members of the Project Steering Committee;&#13;
* a Project Management Unit (PMU), reporting directly to the Steering Committee, that would be&#13;
established in the MAF. The PMU would be staffed with 2 full-time professionals (one from&#13;
the MAF and one from the Mol; one of them would be the Project Coordinator), one&#13;
procurement specialist who would also supervise disbursement procedures, and one&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
administrative assistant. The accounting of project activities and disbursement operations would&#13;
be the responsibility of the accounting service of the MAF. The PMU would be responsible for&#13;
coordinating project implementation by the various institutions involved both at central and&#13;
regional level, and project monitoring and evaluation. The PMU would also be responsible in&#13;
particular for managing the project Special Account, coordinating Bank financing of project&#13;
activities, and submitting progress reports according to World Bank rules. Project effectiveness&#13;
would be contingent upon actual establishment of the PMU with full staff and office facility.&#13;
B. Financial Mechanisms&#13;
4.6    The sources of project funding are (i) the Ministry of Finance as borrower of the World Bank&#13;
loan and provider of the Government's own contribution through budgetary allocation to the Mol; and&#13;
(ii) HS with its own resources. Standard financial mechanisms of the Government and HS would apply&#13;
to all project activities, except for coastal forest reconstruction on private land.  These standard&#13;
mechanisms would be based (i) for Bank financed activities, on contracts by HS and the Mol with&#13;
providers of goods, works, and services, and on the particular arrangements mentioned above for works&#13;
carried out under force account (see para. 3.27); and (ii) for recurrent costs not financed by the Bank,&#13;
on current MoI and HS procedures for such expenditures.&#13;
4.7    Coastal forest reconstruction on private land (see para. 3.7), which represents only 1 percent of&#13;
total project costs, would be financed under existing mechanisms established for private forestry. These&#13;
activities would be subject to a specific contract between HS and the owner (see Annex F) financed by&#13;
a State capital grant that would be channeled to the eligible private land owner through the "Fund for&#13;
Biological Reproduction in Private Forest" currently administered by HS.&#13;
C. Technical Assistance and Training&#13;
4.8    Technical assistance (TA) would be funded for financial and organizational issues only.&#13;
Technical assistance would help HS improve its financial management and privatize non-core activities.&#13;
This would include support to developing an improved cost accounting system, a plan to complete&#13;
ongoing privatization of non-core activities, and a human resource development plan. Training and&#13;
technical assistance would also be provided to MoI to improve the organization of field activities of forest&#13;
fire suppression in coastal zones of Croatia (see para. 3.17). TA to HS and the Mol would be&#13;
implemented according to terms of reference (see Annex B, Appendices 2 and 3) on which the Borrower&#13;
and the Bank have agreed. Training of the PMU staff in procurement matters and in English language&#13;
would be financed under the PHRD Japanese Grant for project preparation.&#13;
D. Project Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
4.9    The project monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) system (see Annex B) would be organized in&#13;
order, first, to monitor project implementation, on the basis of input (i.e., disbursement of project funds,&#13;
and purchase of project equipment) and output (i.e., amount and quality of forest works, and improved&#13;
efficiency in forest fire management) indicators. The M&amp;E system would, second, make it possible to&#13;
evaluate the overall development impact of the project, on the basis of outcome (i.e., improved landscape)&#13;
indicators, on one hand, and economic (i.e., recovery of the tourism industry) and environmental (fauna&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
and flora) impact indicators, on the other hand. The results of project monitoring activities would be an&#13;
integral part of the annual project report and would form the basis for the project completion report.&#13;
4.10   Project M&amp;E would be the overall responsibility of the PMU which would have, in particular,&#13;
the responsibility to coordinate the different operators involved in the M&amp;E system. PMU would be&#13;
directly responsible to monitor input indicators. The monitoring of output and outcome indicators for&#13;
the Coastal Forest Reconstruction component would be the responsibility of the Forest Research Institute,&#13;
under a contract between the latter and the MAF. The monitoring of output and outcome indicators for&#13;
the Forest Fire Management component would be the responsibility of the Mol who would contract the&#13;
appropriate operators. The monitoring of the economic and environmental impact of the project would&#13;
be the responsibility of, respectively, the Institute of Tourism and the Croatia Ecological Society, under&#13;
particular contracts between the latter and the MAF.&#13;
4.11   The Project Steering Committee and the Bank would carry out a Mid-Term Project Review&#13;
before June 30, 1999, that will assess project implementation progress to that date and adjust&#13;
implementation schedule accordingly. At project mid-term in particular, HS is expected to have&#13;
developed and adopted a new cost accounting system consistent with international accounting standards.&#13;
In order to ensure better consultation with the public on project issues, the Government has decided to&#13;
hold briefing sessions annually for interested NGOs on the progress of the project. The basic&#13;
documentation to be discussed would be the annual progress report which is to be prepared for the World&#13;
Bank.&#13;
E. Auditing and Reporting Requirements&#13;
4.12   A separate and auditable project account would be established in the Ministry of Agriculture and&#13;
Forestry (MAF) and project expenditures would be kept separate and identifiable. The project account&#13;
would be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. Separate audit statements&#13;
would be prepared for the Special Account and for Statements of Expenditure. As agreed by the MAF&#13;
and HS, the accounts of the latter would also be reviewed annually by the World Bank.&#13;
4.13   The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will prepare and furnish to the Bank, by December&#13;
1 of each year during the disbursement period, a forward-looking technical and financial report in a&#13;
format acceptable to the Bank, including the proposed forthcoming annual budget for the project and any&#13;
measures that need to be taken during the following year to ensure proper execution of the project. A&#13;
semestrial report on project progress and statements on project expenditures would be submitted to the&#13;
World Bank by the Project Management Unit (PMU). Based on these semestrial reports and on the&#13;
forward-looking report mentioned above, a comprehensive annual report would be compiled which would&#13;
include the results of project monitoring and evaluation activities. A project completion report would be&#13;
prepared by the PMU and FRI upon the completion of the project. Assurances on these auditing and&#13;
reporting requirements have been obtained during negotiations.&#13;
F. Implementation and Supervision Plans&#13;
4.14   Implementation. The main aspects of project implementation -- including implementation&#13;
arrangements, physical targets over the project period, and procurement schedules -- are presented in the&#13;
Project Implementation Plan (see Annex B). Details on the implementation of the different components&#13;
of the project are given in the Annexes F to I in the Implementation Volume of the SAR.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
4.15    Supervison. Careful project supervision would be undertaken by the World Bank. In order&#13;
to ensure that the PMU and the MoI and Ht staff involved in the project are fully aware of project&#13;
implementation arrangements, including procurement, the Bank will organize a one-week project start-up&#13;
seminar when the project becomes effective. The project would be subsequently supervised by the World&#13;
Bank on average twice a year for an estimated total cost of 108 staff-weeks. In the first year, with the&#13;
proposed start-up seminar, the cost is expected to be 24 staff-weeks, falling to 18 staff-weeks in the&#13;
second year. A detailed supervision plan is given also in Annex B.&#13;

CHAPTER V. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Project Benefits&#13;
5.1    In the Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy, this project is envisaged as part of a long-term&#13;
program to restore and maintain favorable ecological conditions in coastal areas in support of tourism.&#13;
Most of the benefits expected from the project would be improved landscape and environmental&#13;
conditions of coastal forests, resulting from the reconstruction of forests destroyed by the war and from&#13;
the reduction in areas of coastal forests burnt by fires. These major benefits are expected, in turn, to&#13;
contribute to increased economic benefits from the rehabilitation of tourism. The environment plays a&#13;
particularly important role in Croatia's coastal areas because of its close links to the performance of the&#13;
tourism sector. Other commercial, social, and institutional, and scientific benefits would also be&#13;
generated, either by forest reconstruction and protection activities or by project activities related to&#13;
support services. The project components would achieve significant increase or preservation of a mix&#13;
of the following benefits.&#13;
5.2     Landscape Value.  Forested landscapes are an important aspect of the Dalmatian coast's&#13;
attractiveness. Evidence shows that forested landscapes significantly increase the attractiveness of resort&#13;
areas. Tourists are less likely to come to areas without such landscapes, or will only come if prices are&#13;
lower. Two surveys of tourist willingness to pay for forest landscapes were conducted, one in Croatia&#13;
and one in competing tourist destinations in Italy. Both showed that tourists have a strong preference for&#13;
forested landscapes, and are willing to pay about 2-3 US$/tourist/day more. An analysis of hotel room&#13;
prices shows that double rooms in hotels in areas with attractive forest landscapes tended to cost about&#13;
3-6 US$/day more than rooms in hotels in areas with little forest landscape. Rehabilitation of forest areas&#13;
in tourist areas is also crucial to the recovery of the tourist industry because the persistence of devastated&#13;
areas close to tourist resorts undermines the country's ability to assure tourists that the threat of hostilities&#13;
is no longer a factor.&#13;
5.3     Hunting. Forests also provide recreational opportunities for foreign tourists in the form of&#13;
hunting activities. Areas near tourist destinations provide particularly attractive hunting venues because&#13;
of their accessibility and the possibility of combining hunting with other activities in a single vacation.&#13;
On good hunting lands, these leases generally cost about 20 US$/ha, with a range of 33 US$/ha on very&#13;
good hunting land to 7 US$/ha on marginal hunting land.&#13;
5.4     Wood Production. Although the coastal areas are not as important for wood production as&#13;
inland areas, some local wood is used for pulp and for sawlogs. Pulp production is currently suspended,&#13;
since the factory in Bosnia-Herzegovina is inaccessible, but is likely to resume soon as the peace process&#13;
progresses. In any case, likely future wood shortages in Europe will make the wood from Croatia's&#13;
coastal forests increasingly valuable.&#13;
5.5     Other Benefits. In addition to the main benefits mentioned above, the project would also have&#13;
a positive impact on the following:&#13;
* Recreational Value. Forest areas provide recreational benefits to local populations, especially&#13;
where they are in close proximity to population concentrations. No information is available on&#13;
the magnitude of these benefits, however;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
* Watershed Protection and Micro-climatic Effects. In general, the coastal area of Croatia is not&#13;
very susceptible to erosion. In some instances, however, even low levels of erosion can cause&#13;
significant damage. Erosion on slopes denuded by fire can cause damage to adjacent urban areas&#13;
by clogging drainage channels, causing flooding, obstructing roads, and increasing cleaning&#13;
costs. Several hydroelectric plants are also vulnerable to sedimentation. In coastal areas,&#13;
fisheries can be affected--particularly oyster beds. Forest cover in watersheds is also important&#13;
to hydrological cycles. Reforestation will also help improve local microclimates by providing&#13;
shade and windbreaks;&#13;
* Employment in Coastal Areas. Although the provision of employment opportunities is not one&#13;
of the project's principal aims, several components would require significant amounts of labor.&#13;
In particular, the investments that are to be made in forest reconstruction, and in cleaning and&#13;
thinning roadside forests are labor intensive. These components would provide significant&#13;
employment opportunities in coastal areas over the project implementation period. The project&#13;
would contribute to maintaining economic activity in areas facing difficulties during Croatia's&#13;
period of reconstruction and economic transition;&#13;
* Improved Management of Coastal Forests.  The project would contribute to improved&#13;
management of coastal forests in the future by contributing to a better knowledge on silviculture,&#13;
breeding, and utilization of these forest resources, and also by helping improve overall efficiency&#13;
of HS.&#13;
B. Markets and Prices&#13;
5.6    No major obstacles are foreseen in terms of marketing the incremental wood production or&#13;
hunting activities, either on the domestic or on the European market, since the foreseen incremental&#13;
marketable output would be modest.&#13;
C. Economic Analysis&#13;
5.7    Economic analysis was an integral part of project preparation. Numerous alternatives were fully&#13;
evaluated before the final project design was arrived at. Even prior to this stage, however, economic&#13;
principles were taken into consideration in project design. Reforestation activities, for example, are&#13;
undertaken primarily in areas where there has been little or no natural regeneration, while cheaper&#13;
silvicultural interventions are carried out where natural regeneration has been strong. Measures designed&#13;
to help prevent forest fires are targeted in areas most at risk and where the damage from fires would be&#13;
greatest.&#13;
5.8    The economic analysis attempted to quantify, to the degree allowed by the available data, the&#13;
range of benefits that reconstruction and protection of Croatian coastal forests would bring. The main&#13;
benefits for which monetary estimates could be made are the value of visible landscapes, the existence&#13;
value of regional forests, wood production, hunting, and erosion control. Since the exact benefits&#13;
obtained from forest areas differ from site to site, site-specific information was used. The methodology&#13;
by which the different benefits were estimated and used to derive the value of forests for use in the&#13;
economic analysis is described in detail in Annex J.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
5.9      Reforestation. HS prepared reforestation plans for 14 proposed sites, covering 4,100 ha to be&#13;
replanted and an additional 787 ha to receive silvicultural treatments. Estimates of the benefits of&#13;
reforestation were made separately for each proposed site, taking into account site-specific characteristics.&#13;
Not all areas provide erosion control benefits, for example, either because erosion rates are low even in&#13;
the absence of forest cover or because there is little of value downstream that is vulnerable to damage.&#13;
Wood production benefits vary depending on the species involved and their mean yields (which in turn&#13;
depend on local agro-climatic conditions). The magnitude of benefits provided by landscape depends on&#13;
whether forests are in fact visible from tourist resorts and by the number of tourists at that resort. The&#13;
without-project case depends on the extent of natural regeneration. Many of the sites where planting is&#13;
planned have little or no natural regeneration because repeated fires have destroyed seed sources. Under&#13;
such conditions, the benefits provided by forests will recover very slowly, if at all. On areas to be&#13;
thinned, on the other hand, natural regeneration is often exuberant. Without silvicultural interventions,&#13;
however, growth would remain stunted because of competition between plants. Based on the estimated&#13;
costs and benefits at each site, 7 sites were selected, covering 1,069 ha to be planted and 411 ha to&#13;
undergo silvicultural treatment. Table 5.1 shows the estimated benefits from reforestation at the selected&#13;
reforestation sites. An additional 3 sites in the Krka National Park, covering 169 ha to be planted and&#13;
286 ha to undergo silvicultural treatment, were also selected using cost-effectiveness criteria. Based on&#13;
the results of the analysis, criteria were developed for the selection of additional sites to complete the&#13;
planned reforestation program.&#13;

5.10    Fire management. In order to evaluate the value of forests protected from forest fires, separate&#13;
estimates were made of the average value of forests in different areas. These were then combined in a&#13;
weighted average, using the relative probability of different areas burning as weights. Since forests that&#13;
provide important landscape benefits tend to be in areas that are very vulnerable to fires (48 % of fires&#13;
take place within 5km of the coast), protection of forests providing landscape benefits is a major source&#13;
of benefits from the forest fire management component. Conversely, protection of wood production plays&#13;
a minor role, since the areas which provide the highest wood production benefits are the least likely to&#13;
burn. Table 5.2 shows the estimated values of the benefits that would be lost when a hectare of forest&#13;
is destroyed by fire, and the relative contribution made by various kinds of benefits to this value. These&#13;
estimates were then combined with estimates of the reductions in areas burnt -- an estimated 1,600 ha of&#13;
forests annually -- that would be achieved following implementation of the proposed fire management&#13;
measures.&#13;

5.11    As can be seen in tables 5.1 and 5.2, the contribution they make to the landscape of tourist areas&#13;
is the most important single benefit provided by Croatia's coastal forests. Since this benefit is a public&#13;
good, however, private agents have no incentives to provide it.&#13;
5.12    Results. The project is considered to be economically viable. The results of the economic&#13;
analysis are given in Table 5.3 below. Since only about a fifth of the area to be reforested has been&#13;
selected, a range of likely returns from the additional sites is projected, based on the lowest and highest&#13;
returns found at sites already selected. Benefits from reforestation undertaken later will tend to be higher,&#13;
since landscape benefits will be magnified by the larger tourist populations, giving a range of 20-27&#13;
percent for additional sites. The overall project economic return is estimated at around 15 percent based&#13;
on the aggregation of the net benefits of the individual components. This estimated rate of return is&#13;
conservative because many benefits remain unquantified for lack of data; in particular benefits to local&#13;
populations (such as recreational benefits and harvest of non-timber products) are not quantified.&#13;
Moreover, the assumptions made in estimating the quantified benefits were conservative (see para 5.14).&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
5.13    The estimated economic returns of about 15 percent are above the OCC benchmark of 10&#13;
percent. The rate of return on the reforestation component (24.2 percent on already selected sites, 20-27&#13;
percent on future sites) is higher than for forest fire management (about 13 percent), since it is easier to&#13;
target investments where the returns are high. Although fire management activities are targeted to the&#13;
extent possible (for example, silvicultural interventions designed to reduce the probability and intensity&#13;
of fires are concentrated in areas most at risk and where damages would be greatest), some activities can&#13;
only be provided as a public good to the entire region. Some of the areas that will be protected by fire-&#13;
fighting forces would not by themselves have justified the proposed fire management investments.&#13;
5.14    Sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken on the most important assumptions.&#13;
In general, conservative values were used throughout. The data on tourist willingness to pay for forest&#13;
landscapes, for example, could have justified estimates as high as 3-4US$/tourist/day, yet a value of&#13;
1.5US$/tourist/day is used. Even so, the proposed forest fire management investments would remain&#13;
profitable even if tourist willingness to pay was reduced further by about 15-20 %. The proposed&#13;
reforestation activities are even more robust; reforestation would remain economically viable on&#13;
practically all sites even if tourist willingness to pay were reduced by two-thirds. Similarly, both&#13;
components can withstand significant reductions in the assumed recovery of tourism. Reforestation would&#13;
remain profitable at all the selected sites even if tourism recovered to only 40 million overnights (instead&#13;
of the assumed pre-war level of 60 million), and fire management investments would remain profitable&#13;
even if tourism recovered to only 50 million overnights. The results are also robust to changes in the&#13;
other assumptions. All reforestation sites would remain viable, for example, even if all benefits other&#13;
than visible landscape were reduced to zero. It should also be borne in mind that the estimated benefits&#13;
omit, for lack of data, several important categories of benefits. Although these omitted benefits are&#13;
probably small relative to the benefits which were measured, their omission does mean the estimated&#13;
returns to the project are conservative.&#13;
5.15    Distribution of benefits. The distribution of benefits from both components is closely tied to&#13;
the category of benefits. In the reconstruction component, landscape benefits accrue to the tourism&#13;
sector, through greater tourist attendance and higher prices; wood production benefits accrue to Hrvatske&#13;
Sume; hunting benefits accrue to Hrvatske Sume through income from hunting leases, and indirectly to&#13;
the tourism sector through increased attractiveness of destinations; erosion prevention benefits accrue to&#13;
municipalities who no longer have to repair damages caused by sedimentation. In the forest fire&#13;
management component, the same is true except that benefits take the form of averted losses rather than&#13;
increases in benefits. The tourist sector and municipalities on the coast will also gain additional,&#13;
unquantified benefits in the form of improved local micro-climates. It is also worth stressing that local&#13;
populations also value coastal forests, both in and of themselves and for their recreational, hunting,&#13;
woodfuel, and non-timber benefits (unfortunately, data were not available to quantify these benefits).&#13;
5.16    Alternatives. Numerous alternatives were analyzed, in various degrees of detail, during project&#13;
preparation before the final design was arrived at.&#13;
* During preparation of the reconstruction component, full economic analyses were carried out&#13;
of the benefits of reforestation on 14 sites, totalling 4,419 ha, as detailed in Annex J. From this&#13;
initial list, the 7 sites listed in Table 5.1 (totalling 1,069 ha) were selected for the initial&#13;
reforestation plan, while the others were discarded as providing insufficient benefits or held over&#13;
until additional information could be obtained.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
* Several less ambitious packages of activities were considered and evaluated during preparation&#13;
of the fire management component, before deciding to adopt a comprehensive package of&#13;
measures. For example, measures aimed at improving the timeliness of fire detection and in&#13;
reducing the response time could have substantially increased the effectiveness of current fire-&#13;
fighting forces at modest cost. While the rate of return on such measures would have been&#13;
relatively high, however, their total impact would have been small and the improvement would&#13;
have limited to a small fraction of the area at risk. The impact of a comprehensive package of&#13;
measures is likely to be greater than the sum of its parts: the reduction in area burnt resulting&#13;
from implementing the package of activities are greater than the cumulative reduction in area&#13;
burnt resulting from each element of the package.&#13;
* The alternative of acquiring second-hand, piston-engined aircraft to fulfill the water tanker&#13;
requirement was analyzed in great detail. Used aircraft would have a lower initial price but a&#13;
higher operational cost and a shorter useful life; their capabilities would be lower, but more&#13;
could be acquired for the same cost. Although the analysis found that used aircraft would have&#13;
a slightly higher rate of return, the Croatian government felt the difference was too small the&#13;
additional problems involved with the use of used equipment, including lower reliability and the&#13;
difficulty of obtaining spare parts. Obtaining fuel for piston-engined aircraft is also becoming&#13;
increasingly difficult. Morover additional installations are required at all airports from which&#13;
the aircraft are to be operated. Turbine-engined aircraft can use the same fuel as commercial&#13;
airliners, which is cheaper and widely available.&#13;
D. Risks&#13;
5.17    The main project risks are associated with the possibility of hostility resumption, and the delay&#13;
in tourism recovery. The risk of hostilities within Croatia in general, and in its coastal zone in particular,&#13;
has been significantly reduced as a result of the re-establishment of Government control, in early August&#13;
1995, over most of Croatia's internationally recognized territory, and of the Peace Agreement that was&#13;
signed in November 1995 in neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina. Although there may continue to be&#13;
regional tensions, the risk of conflict-related damage to project investments is small.&#13;
5.18    The potential risk of reduced benefits of the project due to delay in the recovery of the tourist&#13;
industry has been mitigated by adopting conservative values in the assumptions used in the economic&#13;
analysis of the project. The sensitivity analysis shows that reforestation remains profitable even if tourism&#13;
recovers to only two-thirds of prewar levels within a six-year period (i.e., 30% less than the basic&#13;
assumption).&#13;
5.19    An other potential risk could be associated with poor operation and maintenance of the fire-&#13;
fighting equipment. This risk is minimal given the previous experience of the Ministry of Interior with&#13;
the proposed technology and the availability of training and maintenance services under the equipment&#13;
purchase contract.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF CROATIA&#13;
COASTAL FOREST RECONSTRUCTION AND PROTECTION PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX B.&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (PIP)&#13;
A. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
Responsibilities&#13;
i.         The Borrower is the Government of the Republic of Croatia, represented by the Ministry&#13;
of Finance. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) will have overall responsibility over the&#13;
project; Hrvatske Sume (HS) - i.e., the Forestry Department of the MAF -- and the Ministry of Interior&#13;
(Mol) will share the responsibility for the implementation of the project. Day-to-day coordination of&#13;
project activities will be the responsibility of the Project Management Unit (PMU) established within the&#13;
MAF. The PMU will report directly to a Project Steering Committee composed by representatives of&#13;
MAF, HS and Mol. Particular project activities, mostly under the Support Services component, will be&#13;
contracted either by Ht or the MoI to other Government agencies and to an NGO.&#13;
Organization of Project Implementation&#13;
2.         Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF). The MAF is highest administrative authority&#13;
in the forestry sector; it operates through the Forestry and Wildlife Department which is organized in two&#13;
Divisions: the Forestry and Wildlife Division and a Division with inspection duties carried out at the level&#13;
of the 22 administrative districts ("Zupanije"). The MAF will be directly responsible for project&#13;
management and monitoring of all project activities, through the PMU and the Project Steering&#13;
Committee established within the Ministry (see para. 8)&#13;
3.         Hrvatske gume (H9). HS is an autonomous public enterrise responsible for managing all&#13;
State and other public forest land under the authority of the MAF. H is organized in 15 forest districts&#13;
("Uprava guma") and 168 local offices (kumarija) and is directed by a Management Board of 9 members,&#13;
6 appointed by the Ministry and 3 elected by employees. HS is responsible for all works related to forest&#13;
management, from regeneration to selling roundwood at road side and, in some cases, transportation to&#13;
the firms. HS manages 0.5 million ha of forests and other forest land for game and in some National&#13;
Parks HS manages the forest area by applying strict criteria of environmental protection. The HS's&#13;
mandate also includes (i) supervision and general enforcement of forest laws and regulations in non-State&#13;
forests; however, its employees do not operate as a police corps; and (ii) training and extension to private&#13;
and public organization outside the State enterprise, but this still represents a limited part in the HA's&#13;
activities. Forest activities are carried out partly by HS's own work force and partly by private&#13;
contractors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX B&#13;
Page 2 of 13&#13;
4.          HS will be responsible for the implementation of the coastal forest reconstruction&#13;
component, which includes forest rehabilitation and reconstruction of the Piket nursery and the Tresteno&#13;
arboretum. HS will also be responsible for forestry works under the forest fire management component&#13;
(fire prevention and pre-suppression) and for forestry and GIS research under the support service&#13;
component. HS would provide staff for planning, carrying out and supervising project activities. A&#13;
portion of works will be carried out through contracting to local entrepreneurs according to bidding&#13;
procedures. HS will be responsible for the rehabilitation of forests on State land, and will supervise&#13;
planting on private land supported by the project. Together with the local authorities and the Ministry of&#13;
Tourism, HS will be responsible for selecting sites for reforestation on State land and for identifying&#13;
private land eligible for project support. HS will provide technical assistance to private owners&#13;
undertaking reforestation works on their land and will be responsible for administering the Fund for&#13;
Biological Reproduction in Private Forest. HS -- through the Forestry Research Institute -- will be&#13;
responsible also for the research program in coastal forestry and the GIS research program. Procurement&#13;
arrangements for activities under HS's direct responsibility (preparation of technical specifications, draft&#13;
bidding documents and evaluation reports for goods and works, and terms of reference for consultant&#13;
services) will be handled by HS, at central or local level depending on the nature of the project activity,&#13;
with the support and under the supervision of the PMU.&#13;
5.          Ministry of Interior (MoI). The MoI has overall responsibility for forest fire control and&#13;
collaborates with HS in forest fire prevention and combat. The organization of fire-fighting under the Mol&#13;
includes a command center in Zagreb -- "State Operational Center" -- and 7 regional Operational&#13;
Centers, one for each of the 7 coastal Zupanija. Under the project, the Mol will be responsible for&#13;
implementing the forest fire management component and part of the support service component. In&#13;
particular, the Mol will be directly responsible for: (i) raising public awareness of forest fire damage,&#13;
in cooperation with municipalities and the Ministry of Education; (ii) improving the ability to forecast&#13;
and detect forest fires and access burning areas, in cooperation with the Meteorological and Hydrological&#13;
Service and with HS; and (iii) increasing the capacity to suppress forest fires including the use of aerial&#13;
fire-fighting in cooperation with the Army, and terrestrial fire-fighting (MoI professional fire brigades)&#13;
in cooperation with municipalities (volunteer fire brigades); (iv) equipping the operational centers with&#13;
GIS facilities; and (vi) testing new methods of aerial fire fighting. Mol would be responsible for handling&#13;
most of the procurement arrangements related to the activities under its direct responsibility (preparation&#13;
of technical specifications, draft bidding documents and evaluation reports for goods and works, and&#13;
terms of reference for consultant services) in close cooperation and under the supervision of the PMU.&#13;
Special Agreements&#13;
6.          Particular project activities would be carried out by Government agencies and NGOs with&#13;
highly specialized and unique experience in their technical/scientific field. HS will enter into agreements&#13;
with:&#13;
the Academy of Sciences and Arts (ASA) for the reconstruction of the arboretum in Trsteno;&#13;
the arboretum belongs to the ASA and was severely damaged by fire during the recent war.&#13;
HS will be responsible for the supervision of the rehabilitation works and purchase of&#13;
equipment.&#13;
the Forestry Research Institute (FRI) to carry out forestry research and GIS research&#13;
programs; the FRI will enter into sub-agreements with the Zagreb University for some of&#13;
the research activities; FRI will be responsible for developing a work plan for each research&#13;
project which will be reviewed and approved by HS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX B&#13;
Page 3 of 13&#13;
7.         The MoI will enter into agreement with the Meteorological and Hydrological Service to&#13;
operate the weather forecast system. The MAF will contract the FRI, the Croatia Ecological Society&#13;
(CRE), and the Institute of Tourism (Io7) to carry out the project monitoring and evaluation program (see&#13;
para. 12). The FRI will be responsible for monitoring the output of the forest reconstruction component&#13;
and will issue guidelines for soil preparation, fertilizer application and species selection. The CRE will&#13;
be responsible for monitoring the environmental impact of the project and the loT for monitoring the&#13;
economic impact of the project. Draft agreements and terms of reference for the above activities would&#13;
be submitted for review and approval to the Bank during the negotiations of the Loan.&#13;
Project Management&#13;
8.         Project management would be the overall responsibility of the MAF with the support of:&#13;
*     a Project Steering Committee, chaired by the MAF and composed of four members: the&#13;
Vice-Minister of International Relations (MAF), the Vice-Minister of Forestry (MAF), the&#13;
Director General of HS, and the Director of the Fire and Explosives Prevention Department&#13;
(Mol). The Steering Committee would be responsible for the approval of the annual project&#13;
work program and budget prepared by the PMU, quarterly reviews of implementation and&#13;
approval of budget adjustments proposed by the PMU, overall monitoring of project&#13;
execution, and assistance in resolving evolving problems;&#13;
&#149;     a Project Management Unit (PMU), reporting directly to the Steering Committee and&#13;
established within the MAF. The PMU would be staffed with 2 full-time professionals (one&#13;
from the MAF and one from the Mol; one of which would have responsibilities as Project&#13;
Coordinator), one procurement specialist who would also supervise disbursement operations,&#13;
and one staff assistant. The accounting service of the MAF will be responsible for handling&#13;
the accounting of project activities and disbursement operations, under the supervision of&#13;
the PMU. The PMU would be responsible for: (i) coordinating project implementation by&#13;
the various institutions involved both at central and regional level; (ii) managing the project&#13;
Special Account and ensuring that financial resources for project activities are made&#13;
available to the implementers in a timely manner; (iii) ensuring that procurement procedures&#13;
handled by the implementers are in compliance with Bank procurement guidelines; (iv)&#13;
monitoring project activities, setting annual plans for physical implementation, expenditures&#13;
and costs and preparing quarterly project progress reports for the approval of the Steering&#13;
Committee; ensuring the timely preparation and submission of annual project financial audit&#13;
reports. The establishment of a fully staffed and equipped PMU will be condition for World&#13;
Bank's approval of the loan.&#13;

D. PROJECT MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
12.            The project monitoring and evaluation system would be organized in order to (i) monitor&#13;
project implementation, on the basis of input and output indicators; and (ii) evaluate the overall&#13;
development impact of the project, on the basis of outcome indicators, on one hand, and economic and&#13;
environmental impacts, on the other hand.&#13;
Indicators&#13;
13.            Input, Output, and Outcome. The proposed input, output, and outcome indicators that&#13;
would be monitored, together with the proposed responsibilities for monitoring, would be the following.&#13;

14.          Impact. The economic impact of the project would be monitored in terms of recovery&#13;
of the tourism industry in the coastal areas of Croatia. Proposed indicators would include (i) the number&#13;
of tourists; and (ii) the price of overnights in project areas. The Institute of Tourism is developing a&#13;
scheme allowing to determine the impact of project activities (e.g. comparison of 10 "couples" of hotels&#13;
with and without burned forest environment). As regards the environmental impact of the project, the&#13;
Croatian Ecological Society has proposed indicators on (i) vegetation; (ii) invertebrates; and (iii)&#13;
vertebrates. These indicators would be monitored in 2 sites (in Trogir and in Dubrovnik) before project&#13;
intervention, and after 2 and 5 years.&#13;
Responsibilities&#13;
15.          Project monitoring and evaluation would be the overall responsibility of the Project&#13;
Management Unit (PMU) which will have, in particular, the responsibility to coordinate the different&#13;
operators involved in the monitoring and evaluation system. PMU would be directly responsible to&#13;
monitor input indicators. The monitoring of output and outcome indicators for the Coastal Forest&#13;
Reconstruction component would be the responsibility of the Forest Research Institute, under a contract&#13;
between the latter and the MAF. The monitoring of output and outcome indicators for the Forest Fire&#13;
Management component would be the responsibility of Mol who would contract the appropriate&#13;
operator(s). As mentioned earlier, the monitoring of the economic and environmental impact of the&#13;
project would be the responsibility of, respectively, the Institute of Tourism and the Croatia Ecological&#13;
Society, under particular contracts between the latter and the MAF.&#13;
Implementation and Cost&#13;
16.          A detailed proposal for the implementation of this system, including costs and&#13;
organizational arrangements, would be presented by the MAF before the negotiations of the Loan. At&#13;
this stage, the cost of the implementation of the proposed system is an estimated US$250,00, according&#13;
to the following tentative breakdown:&#13;
*        monitoring of output and outcome indicators for&#13;
the Coastal Forest Reconstruction component&#13;
by the Forest Research Institute, and for&#13;
the Forest Fire Management component by the Mol      US$150,000&#13;
*        monitoring of the economic impact of the project&#13;
by the Institute of Tourism, and of the environmental&#13;
impact of the project by the Croatia Ecological Society  US$100,000&#13;
E. ROLE OF THE BANK&#13;
17.          Careful project supervision would be undertaken by the World Bank. In order to ensure&#13;
that the PMU and the Mol and HS services involved in the project are fully aware of project&#13;
implementation arrangements, including procurement, the Bank will organize a one-week project start-up&#13;
seminar when the project becomes effective, tentatively in October 1996. The project would be&#13;
subsequently supervised by the World Bank on average twice a year according to the supervision plan&#13;
presented in the table below. The proposed budget for this supervision work is 108 staff weeks. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
FOR THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO HRVATSKE 9UME&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Hrvatske Sume (HS) is a state-owned Enterprise created on January 1, 1991 under the Forestry Law. HS&#13;
is responsible for managing about 2 million ha of state and other public forest land. HS is a financially autonomous&#13;
enterprise under the control of the MAF. It is managed by a Director General who reports to a 9-member Executive&#13;
Board. HS is organized in 16 forest districts ('Uprava Suma' ) and 173 local offices ( " Sumarijas"). Forest activities&#13;
are partly carried out by H(,'s own work-force (10,000 employees) and partly by private contractors (about 40%&#13;
of forest activities). HS staff also carries out non-direct forestry activities such as road constructions, transportation&#13;
of logs, nurseries, fisheries, housing and resort management.&#13;
2.    Ht organizational structure and management is considered satisfactory and since its creation the company&#13;
has always been profitable. However, HS's operations and performance have been affected by the war and HS'&#13;
is still recovering from its aftermath: disorganization within the forests, war damages, forest workers drafted by&#13;
the Army but still on HS's payroll, requisitions of equipment and material for the Army. HS's overheads are&#13;
increasing (from an estimate 30% of total costs in 1993 to 37% in June 1995) mainly because of the overstaffing&#13;
of administrative employees (13 % of total employees in 1995 compared to 11 % in 1993). About 1,400 employees&#13;
are occupied in non-core forestry activities with a high value of fixed assets (housing, resorts, machines and&#13;
equipment). Finally, HS is obliged to be controlled by external auditors; but HS's financial accounts are not&#13;
required to meet international standards.&#13;
3.    As part of the institutional strengthening component, the project will provide technical assistance to&#13;
Hrvatske tume (HS) in three critical areas: (i) accounting and financial control; (ii) privatization of non-core&#13;
activities; and (iii) human resource development.&#13;
Accounting and Financial Control&#13;
4.    The project will assist HS in improving the accounting system, the financial control and the reporting of&#13;
financial management information in the context of the existing decentralized system. The objectives would be to&#13;
obtain accounts approaching international standards and consolidated information controlled by auditors. Such an&#13;
improvement would be reached by introducing a double accounting system for profit-oriented and non profit-&#13;
oriented activities (e.g., within protective forests); this new system would clarify HS's relationship with the State&#13;
and increase the transparency of Forest Districts and Upravas' operations in the productive forests.&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
5.    The technical assistance would:&#13;
a.    carry out a general review and assessment of the cost accounting system and audit procedures currently&#13;
being used by Ht with regards to, among other things, (i) differences with international accounting standards; (ii)&#13;
adequacy of financial control; and (iii) method of reporting detailed and consolidated accounts to senior&#13;
management and the government;&#13;
b.    recommend in which form base financial information should be recorded and compiled;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX B&#13;
Page 12 of 13&#13;
c.     assist in designing and implementing an improved data recording system for actual revenues and costs as&#13;
they are accrued, based on the separate accounting of profit-oriented activities and non-commercial activities, and&#13;
recommend the degree of data compilation and the reporting categories required for control purposes and the&#13;
production of management accounts;&#13;
d.    assist in designing and implementing an appropriate reporting format to record actual revenue and cost data&#13;
in such a way that performance can be measured monthly against budgeted figures;&#13;
e.    assist in developing and implementing a financial monitoring system whereby actual results are measured&#13;
against budgeted results on a regular basis and at intervals of not more than one month;&#13;
f.    develop appropriate internal audit procedures.&#13;
6.    Moreover, the technical assistance would help HD assess the financial consequences of the recovery of&#13;
previously occupied forests , particularly as concerns the financial sustainability of HS.&#13;
Privatization of Non-core Activities&#13;
7.    Hg has developed and started to implement a program for privatizing non-core forestry activities; however,&#13;
the scope of the privatization process is limited to a few operations (a small trading activity in Vincovci, a fish-&#13;
packaging plant in Lanisce, a tooth-pick plant in Vrbovsko, a fish nursery in Lipovljani, and a hunting resort in&#13;
Delnice). The privatization process should include all non-core forestry activities, such as fisheries, nurseries,&#13;
housing and resorts, and also transportation and road construction (those two activities are making heavy losses&#13;
according to the cost analysis). Around 1,400 employees are occupied in those activities.&#13;
8.    The technical assistance would:&#13;
a.     help design a complete privatization program concerning all non-core forestry activities taking into&#13;
consideration all possible options (leasing, selling with installment contracts, renting formulas...);&#13;
b.    help evaluate assets, identify priorities and design financing plans;&#13;
c.    help design and implement training schemes for former Hg's employees affected by the privatization&#13;
process, particularly oriented at strengthening their capabilities as entrepreneurs;&#13;
d.    advise and help implement the phasing-out of administrative staff, according to the privatization program&#13;
and overheads cut plan.&#13;
Human Resource Development&#13;
9.    Ht's Development Program for 1991-2025 aims at improving the efficiency of the enterprise's activities,&#13;
partly through a reorganization of H§'s staff within the existing structure. The objective would be to significantly&#13;
decrease the overheads by lower the number of administrative staff to European standards. This policy would be&#13;
implemented in parallel with the privatization program and the pre-retirement program implemented since 1993.&#13;
The technical assistance would help (a) design a reorganization plan which would reduce the staff ratio to four&#13;
technical staff for one administrative staff (instead of the actual ratio of two out of one;) and (b) implement the&#13;
program over the next five years.&#13;

TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
FOR TRAING AND TECENCAL ASSISTANCE TO THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The threat of forest fires represent the greatest danger to the coastal forests of Croatia. Due to both natural&#13;
and human caused conditions, the occurrence of forest fires has become a regular feature of the Croatia coastal&#13;
region. The outbreak of war in 1991 also contributed to the destruction of forest land by incendiary bombing.&#13;
The Ministry of Interior (Mol) has developed and is beginning to implement a comprehensive strategy that&#13;
combines measures to improve its fire prevention, fire detection and fire -fighting capabilities by establishing an&#13;
improved system of fire control. Prevention and pre-suppression activities are joint responsibility of the Mol and&#13;
the Ministry of Agriculture through Hrvatske Sume (HS). The Mol has the main responsibility for fire&#13;
suppression, and through its command center in Zagreb and seven regional operational centers coordinates the&#13;
activates of various fire brigades located in municipalities throughout the country.&#13;
2.    As part of the fire-management component, the project will provide technical assistance to MoI to improve&#13;
the organization in the field of forest fire pre-suppression and suppression in the coastal zones of Croatia. This&#13;
would include the assistance from international experts and study tours to countries and organizations facing&#13;
problems similar to those in Croatia.&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
3.     The technical assistance program designed under the Project would include:&#13;
Training at operational centers located in France (Marseille, Valabre, Marignane, Toulon, Avignon, and Nice)&#13;
4.     The training program would be organized in two modules: one-week course targeted to the Chiefs and&#13;
Deputy Chiefs of the Croatian Operational Centers (14 participants) and two-week course for two higher level staff&#13;
from each centers (14 participants). The training program would focus on:&#13;
i)     coordination of air and land fire-fighting forces and communication methods;&#13;
ii)    short-term planning of fire-fighting activities (one to two days)&#13;
iii)   long-term planning of fire-fighting activities&#13;
iv)    economic analysis of different uses of aerial fire-fighting&#13;
v)     data collection and recording at the Operational Centers&#13;
Technical assistance for the purchase of highly specialized eguipment under the project&#13;
5.     Consultant services will be provided under the project to advise and assist the Moi in the selection and&#13;
purchase of fire-fighting equipment, GIS, telecommunication and weather forecast systems. The consultant(s) will&#13;
assist in the preparation of technical specifications, bidding documents and selection of firms under LIB or IS&#13;
procedures&#13;
Study tours on forest fire management in Mediterranean countries&#13;
6.     Selected staff of the operational centers will visit operational centers in France, Portugal and Italy to&#13;
exchange views and learn from the experience on fire fighting protection system in the Mediterranean coastal area.&#13;

            Croatia - Coastal Forest Reconstruction and
            Protection Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The main objective of the Coastal Forest
            Reconstruction and Protection Project is to restore and
            protect forest land in the coastal zone of Croatia in order
            to enhance the landscape and recreation values of the region
            and thereby contribute to restore tourism to its pre-war
            level.  Other objectives are to: a) restore the
            environmental role of coastal forests destroyed by the war,
            by protecting soil and water, and initiate the restoration
            of the natural vegetation; b) address the forest fire
            problem; and c) develop the knowledge base for improved
            management and protection of coastal forests.  The project,
            to be implemented over 5 years, will include the following 3
            components: a) reconstruction of coastal forests, a nursery
            and an arboretum destroyed by war activities; b) forest fire
            management in coastal areas including a comprehensive
            package of prevention, presuppression, and suppression
            measures; and c) support services including the development
            of a geographic information system (GIS) for forest fire
            management, coastal forestry research, institutional support
            and project management and monitoring.
