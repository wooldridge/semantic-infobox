economic recovery. In an extreme case of major&#13;
deterioration of economic conditions driven by&#13;
these risks, SEE6 output growth in 2014 could&#13;
more than halve (to 0.6 percent) compared to&#13;

growth would be slashed by a third (1.7 percent)&#13;

sustained effort by the SEE6 countries for&#13;

  Box 1: Global Economic Developments&#13;
&#13;
  Global growth recovery remained on track in the first quarter of 2014, due mainly to a strong pick&#13;
  up in high income countries. In the US, after a moderate deceleration in the first two months of&#13;
  the year, incoming data suggest that the economy is accelerating again after the deep winter freeze.&#13;
  Along with stronger job growthâ&#128;&#148;2.4 million new jobs have been added since the start of 2014â&#128;&#148;&#13;
  rising stock and housing prices are boosting household income and wealth, and consumer confidence&#13;
  and spending are strengthening. In the Euro Area, Purchasing Managers Index data for January&#13;
  and February show resurgent activity in Germany and expansion everywhere else save France where&#13;
  confidence is nevertheless improving. The Euro Area manufacturing index also rose in March close&#13;
  to its highest levels in nearly three years. Significant spare capacity and persistently low Euro Area-&#13;
  wide inflation, however, are generating real concerns about deflation. In Japan, the domestically-&#13;
  driven recovery has seen a surge in industrial output growth to 12 percent (3m/3m saar) in February,&#13;
  the strongest since the rebound after the 2011 earth-quake and tsunami disaster. Rising private&#13;
  consumption in anticipation of a consumption tax hike in April should boost growth in Q1 2014&#13;
  but the drag from the tax increase, without offsetting further fiscal and monetary stimulus, is set to&#13;
  decelerate the pace of recovery. In developing countries, industrial output growth weakened despite&#13;
  surging exports, mainly reflecting weaknesses in Brazil, China, and India. The lackluster industrial&#13;
  performance contrasts with exports from developing countries such as China, which surged in&#13;
  Q4 2013 and continued at 8 percent annualized pace in the three months to January. The softness in&#13;
  industrial production partly reflects capacity constraints among the large middle-income countries,&#13;
  but financial headwinds, monetary policy tightening, and lower commodity prices also contributed&#13;
  to slowing domestic activities.&#13;
&#13;
  The Federal Reserve began tapering its Quantitative Easing (QE) program in January, prompted&#13;
  by the improving growth prospects of the U.S. economy. The reaction of financial markets was&#13;
  initially muted, with long-term U.S. Treasury yields remaining stable and volatility in currency&#13;
  markets remaining low, suggesting that a large part of the tapering impact had already been priced&#13;
  in. The calm was broken at the end of January when the Argentinian peso was suddenly devalued,&#13;
  worries about the Chinese economy grew; and other country-specific economic and political factors&#13;
  intruded. Gross capital flows to developing and emerging countries reached a new record low in&#13;
  February. Stock markets and currencies in a number of emerging economies came under pressure,&#13;
  and several large middle-income economies embarked on aggressive policy tightening to relieve the&#13;
  stress on their currencies and domestic inflation, notably Argentina, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Turkey,&#13;
  and South Africa. While capital flows to developing and emerging economies rebounded in March,&#13;
  they continue to remain sensitive to global developments. Foreign direct investment (which account&#13;
  for about 60 percent of overall flows) remains the most sizeable and the least volatile form of capital&#13;
  flow, stabilizing overall financial flows to developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
  Growing tension in Ukraine and Russia since late February has so far caused relatively limited&#13;
  disruption in global financial markets except in grain markets. The VIX index, a gauge of global risk&#13;
  aversion, jumped 14 percent in early March while gold prices, a gauge of the geopolitical risk, were&#13;
  up by 15 percent by mid-March but both have subsequently come down. Wheat and maize prices&#13;
  have risen by 17 and 12 percent, respectively, since February, in part reflecting market concerns&#13;
  surrounding Ukraine and Russia, as well as dry weather in North and South America and to a lesser&#13;
  extent in South East Asia.&#13;

&#13;
in 2013. Other countries also saw rebounds&#13;
in their agricultural sectors, though at more&#13;
modest levels.&#13;
&#13;
In contrast to 2012, industrial output grew&#13;
in 2013 in all SEE6 &amp;#3;    (Figure 2). Industrial&#13;
growth in Montenegro was driven by a rebound&#13;
of its hydro-power electricity, and in Serbia by&#13;
FIATâ&#128;&#153;s new production facility. Elsewhere in&#13;
SEE6, industrial activity also grew, but at a&#13;
slower pace.&#13;
&#13;
Data from the first two months of 2014&#13;
indicate that industry continued to grow&#13;
across the region, albeit at uneven rates.&#13;
Available data for four countries show&#13;
that industrial output grew on average by&#13;
4.7 percent over the first two months 2014&#13;
(y-o-y). As expected, after the initial jump in&#13;
car exports, Serbiaâ&#128;&#153;s industrial output growth&#13;
tapered off to 1.2 percent. At the opposite end,&#13;
Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina had&#13;
the highest growth of industrial output among&#13;
SEE6 (driven mostly by manufacturing) with&#13;
6.5 and 6.7 percent growth, respectively.&#13;

   Box 2: Trade Potential for SEE&#13;
&#13;
   Trade theory predicts that the introduction of a free trade area should contribute to economic&#13;
   development and improved regional cooperation. For SEE countries, the CEFTA (Central European&#13;
   Free Trade Agreement) may also be an important part of achieving a smoother transition and&#13;
   accession to the EU. An empirical estimation based on gravity models4 suggests that participating&#13;
   in the CEFTA between 2006 and 2012 had a significant positive effect on trade flows for SEE,&#13;
   increasing exports from SEE countries to CEFTA members by around 72 percent in the observed&#13;
   time period. Overall, the results suggest that SEE exporters are exploiting the opportunities provided&#13;
   by the free trade agreement.&#13;
&#13;
   However, despite the benefits provided by the CEFTA, trade between SEE countries and the EU still&#13;
   appears to be below potential.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Imports from the EU are estimated to be below potential by between 18 and 33 percent,&#13;
      depending upon the country. Lower than potential imports may mean that firms and consumers&#13;
      are paying more for domestically produced goods than they would for imports, harming firm&#13;
      competitiveness and reducing consumer purchasing power.&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢	 Exports are also considerably below potential. Albanian exports to the EU are estimated at&#13;
      40 percent below potential, the highest in the SEE. FYR Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina&#13;
      are around 33 percent less than their potential while Montenegro, Serbia and Kosovo export&#13;
      around 27 percent less to the EU than their estimated potential.&#13;
&#13;
4	 Gravity models estimate trade potential between countries or regions based on their GDPs, proximity and shared characteristics such as language&#13;
   or legal systems.&#13;

&#13;
  Increasing trade with the EU could help to boost employment and growth as well as helping countries&#13;
  to address macroeconomic imbalances.&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 On average, exports are estimated to be further below potential than imports. Redressing both&#13;
     would therefore help to address the large current account deficits most countries in the region&#13;
     have.&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Increasing export opportunities would boost domestic production and increase economic growth&#13;
     through the net export channel.&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Higher exports could lead to more job opportunities in exporting firms.&#13;
&#13;
  What can be done to help SEE countries catch up with their export potential? Weak business&#13;
  environments in many SEE countries hamper firm growth and exports. For example, more&#13;
  streamlined trade rules and regulations are needed. The Doing Business Survey finds that significant&#13;
  time is needed to export in all SEE countries. It takes 12 days to export in FYR Macedonia and&#13;
  Serbia; in Montenegro 14; Kosovo 15; Bosnia&#13;
  and Herzegovina 16 and Albania 19 days.&#13;
  Ensuring that EU safety standards for certified Figure B2.1: Import and Export Gaps in&#13;

external debt remained high. Total external&#13;
debt in SEE6 declined by almost 3 percentage&#13;
points to 63.5 percent of GDP in 2013, mainly&#13;
because of Serbiaâ&#128;&#153;s large (8.3 percentage point)&#13;
decline (Figure 11 and Figure 12). Private&#13;
sector deleveraging drove the regional external&#13;
debt decline in 2013. External debt grew&#13;
slightly in Albania due to an increase in debt&#13;
held by the private sector and low GDP growth&#13;

crisis levels. Youth unemployment rates rose&#13;
by twice as much. Household survey data&#13;
shows that youth unemployment rates are&#13;
generally higher for the poorer segments of&#13;
the income distribution (Figure 18) since&#13;
the young depend more heavily on labor&#13;
earnings for their income. The longer this&#13;
unemployment persists, the more it reinforces&#13;
income disparities and impedes improvements&#13;
in shared prosperity. In addition, tough labor&#13;
market conditions have translated into declined&#13;
labor force participation rates and an increased&#13;
detachment of youth from the labor market.&#13;
Increases in the number of NEETâ&#128;&#148;not in&#13;

of the year and a similar first quarter outturn in                      fiscal deficit in 2014 would be lower. Further&#13;
2013 led to an increase in the deficit. In Kosovo,                      expenditure consolidation measures, tackling&#13;

Further easing should be pursued with&#13;
caution in SEE6. Given deflationary pressures,&#13;
still large output gaps, and the fact that money&#13;
supply only recently started growing faster than&#13;
nominal income, there appears to be room for&#13;
further easing in the countries with monetary&#13;
flexibility. However, if pursued, monetary&#13;
easing should be gradual. Moreover, pressure&#13;
on exchange rates in the countries with flexible&#13;
exchange rates may limit the room for policy&#13;
easing. In the four countries with pegged&#13;
currencies there are limited monetary policy&#13;
tools to overcome deflationary pressures. This&#13;
may impact their public debt through lower&#13;
nominal GDP and potentially lower revenues.&#13;
In addition, in a deflationary environment,&#13;
households and firms may see their debts&#13;
increase as a share of their income, potentially&#13;
exacerbating the problem of non-performing&#13;
loans.&#13;

    despite the decline in the liquidity in many                              Credit growth slowed in Albania, Bosnia&#13;

Against this backdrop, two key challenges&amp;#3;                                    sheets.&#13;
need immediate action by the authorities:&#13;
resuming credit growth in a sustainable manner,                               Second, NPLs increased to historically high&#13;
especially corporate lending; and reversing the                               levels by end-2013. NPLs increased more than&#13;
growth curve of non-performing loans (NPLs).                                  three-fold from an average of 5 percent in the&#13;

First, across the region, despite the recovery                                at end-2013. Albania and Serbia registered&#13;
signs, corporate credit growth declined                                       the highest level of NPLs at end-2013, either&#13;

in 2013.16 Bosnia and Herzegovina also saw&#13;
an increase in NPLs to an historic high of&#13;
15 percent (despite the â&#128;&#156;bulk saleâ&#128;&#157; of bad&#13;
loans in 2011 and 2012), while NPLs in FYR&#13;
Macedonia peaked at 12 percent in Q2 2013&#13;
before declining slightly in the second half of&#13;
the year. NPLs in Kosovo were also at peak&#13;
levels, albeit far below the regional average.&#13;
If they are not reduced, NPLs will continue&#13;
burdening banksâ&#128;&#153; balance sheets, result in high&#13;
collection costs and slowdown the recovery&#13;
process as banks have less lending capacity&#13;
and become more risk-averse(for expended&#13;
discussion on NPLs, see Spotlight 2).&#13;
&#13;
The time for the authorities to deal decisively&#13;
with the challenge of rising NPLs is now&#13;
(see Spotlight 2). Even though the high levels&#13;
&amp;#3;&#13;
of NPLs have not caused serious instability of&#13;
the financial sector as these loans appear to be&#13;
well provisioned and backed by adequate bank&#13;
capital, not tackling this risk head-on may&#13;
further destabilize the fragile banking sector&#13;
and threaten the recovery process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
16	 The decline came largely as a result of â&#128;&#156;bulk salesâ&#128;&#157; of bad loans in&#13;
    2011 and 2012.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Box 3: Global Outlook and Risks&#13;
&#13;
 The world economy is projected to accelerate this year, with high-income economies appearing to&#13;
 finally turn the corner five years after the global financial crisis. Global GDP growth is projected&#13;
 to expand by 2.9 percent in 2014 (versus 2.4 percent in 2013) and 3.4 percent and 3.4 percent in&#13;
 2015 and 2016. Most of the acceleration is expected to come from high income countries, as the&#13;
 drag on growth from fiscal consolidation and policy uncertainty eases and private sector recoveries&#13;
 gain a firmer footing. High-income country growth is projected to strengthen from 1.3 percent in&#13;
 2013 to 2.0 percent this year and 2.4 percent in each of 2015 and 2016. Growth in developing&#13;
 countries is projected to pick up modestly remaining flat at 4.9 percent. With most regions operating&#13;
 at close to capacity, however, growth accelerations in developing countries are expected to be muted&#13;
 going forward, barring substantial supply-side reforms that alleviate structural bottlenecks and&#13;
 raise productivity growth. Stronger high-income growth and import demand will be an important&#13;
 tailwind for developing countriesâ&#128;&#153; exports, which should help compensate for tighter global financial&#13;
 conditions.&#13;
&#13;
 Downside risks for developing countries remain closely tied to headwinds from international financial&#13;
 markets, set against a backdrop of domestic weaknesses. Tightening global financial conditions over&#13;
 the next five years as monetary policy is normalized in high income economies imply weaker financial&#13;
 flows and rising costs of capital. If interest rates rise too rapidly or there are sharp pullbacks in capital&#13;
 flows, economies with large external financing needs or rapid expansions in domestic credit in recent&#13;
 years could come under considerable stress. The relatively smooth progress of the US taper so far and&#13;
 the fact that two bouts of financial turmoil since mid-2013 have not yet triggered severe adjustments&#13;
 in developing countries is a positive, suggesting that tapering-related risks have diminished compared&#13;
 to last year. Nevertheless, the adjustment to tighter global financial conditions is still unfolding,&#13;
 and market sentiment could become unsettled around key decision points related to the taper, for&#13;
 instance the timing of the first policy rate hikes in the US. Risks of currency mismatch from high&#13;
 levels of external debt (the â&#128;&#156;original sinâ&#128;&#157; that felled them in past crises) are not relevant for most&#13;
 developing countries barring developing Europe and Central Asia. Nevertheless, high levels of&#13;
 foreign ownership in domestic bond markets in some economies expose them to shifts in sentiment.&#13;
 Institutional investors, who hold large stocks of local currency debt, have so far maintained their&#13;
 exposures during in the last two episodes of financial market volatility. Still, a further bout of global&#13;
 risk aversion in an environment where the credit ratings of several developing countries are still on a&#13;
 negative outlook could eventually lead to pullbacks from these markets, with severe implications for&#13;
 access to and costs of capital.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    the resolution of NPLs, and public sector                   heightened social tensions, as seen most&#13;

        especially likely to be hit and mining as well&#13;
        as infrastructure may also be harmed. On&#13;
        the other hand, reconstruction efforts may&#13;
        partly counteract the negative effect of the&#13;
        floods. In addition, the increased rainfall&#13;
        will ensure full reservoirs, benefitting&#13;
        hydro-power generation (which suffered&#13;
        during droughts in 2012).&#13;
&#13;
These external and domestic risks, if&#13;
they materialize, will affect negatively&#13;
the prospects for growth in the SEE6&#13;
countries and slow the nascent economic&#13;

&amp;#3;&#13;
deterioration of economic conditions driven&#13;
by the materialization of above risks, SEE6&#13;
output growth in 2014 would less than halve&#13;
(to 0.6 percent) of the baseline projection (of&#13;
1.9 percent). In 2015, growth would drop&#13;
by a third (to 1.7 percent) from the baseline&#13;

the double-dip recession slowed the progress                         year (Figure 44). This performance contrasts&#13;

purchasing power terms, average incomes in                           incomes rose from 30 to close to 40 percent&#13;

  Box 4: Demographic Challenges to Income Convergence in SEE6&#13;
&#13;
  Reform and convergence in SEE6 will be made harder by an aging population. Over time, fewer&#13;
  workers will be able to support an increased retired population. Faster economic growth is required&#13;
  to attract a greater share of the working-age population into the labor market. Creating a business&#13;
  environment that encourages firms to hire and a social environment that encourages working-age&#13;
  people to seek employment will be important. At the same time, governments will need to invest&#13;
  sufficient resources in education to ensure a skilled and productive labor force is available when&#13;
  private sector demand strengthens.&#13;
&#13;
  The issues associated with these demographic developments are aggravated because SEE6 countries&#13;
  do a poor job of attracting migrants. Instead, the SEE6 are champions in Europe in exporting people.&#13;
  The equivalent of a quarter of the current population (25.44 percent in 2013) of SEE6 countries&#13;
  currently lives outside their home countries. In 1990, the shares of emigrants from SEE6 countries&#13;
  was half of what it is today. Over the last two decades, SEE-6 countries experience a sharp increase in&#13;
  emigration and currently roughly 4.9 million people originating in an SEE6 are counted as a migrant&#13;
  in another country. To the extent that SEE6 economies evolve toward innovation and technologically&#13;
  advanced products, a shortage of skills could constrain economic growth in the region. Creating&#13;
  incentives to bring skilled individuals back may soon become a priority for SEE6 economies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
terms of logistics, institutions and regulations        to take advantage of these opportunities are&#13;
will be important to take advantage of the              essential to increase the income generation&#13;
EU market. In addition, governments need                capacity of the entire population.20&#13;
to provide reliable and streamlined processes&#13;
that guarantee EU safety standards are met for&#13;
exporting firms, particularly for agricultural&#13;
exporters. Improvements in governance&#13;
standardsâ&#128;&#148;including the rule of lawâ&#128;&#148;will be&#13;
closely linked to the EU integration process.&#13;
But reforms required by the EU will also help&#13;
to boost economic growth in SEE countries.&#13;
&#13;
Such reforms are essential to boost labor&#13;
demand, reduce unemployment, address the&#13;
challenges driven by demographic changes&#13;
(Box 4) and improve prosperity for all in&#13;
SEE6. Increasing employment is essential&#13;
to reduce poverty and to bring about shared&#13;
prosperity in SEE6. Since the major source of&#13;

Combatting youth unemployment is perhaps                             future earnings and job prospects, and delay or&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This report covers economic
            developments, prospects, and policies in six South Eastern
            European countries (SEE6): Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
            Kosovo, FYR Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia. South East
            Europe (SEE6)'s economy recovered from the 2012
            recession, growing by 2.2 percent on average in 2013. Each
            of the SEE6 countries marked positive growth rates in 2013,
            with growth at or exceeding 3 percent in Kosovo, FYR
            Macedonia and Montenegro. External demand for SEE6 exports,
            especially by the European Union (EU), was the key driver of
            the recovery. On the production side, SEE6 drivers of growth
            were mixed, but in all countries a good agricultural year
            supported economic activity. An export-led recovery combined
            with depressed domestic demand resulted in a significant
            narrowing of current account imbalances in all SEE6
            countries. Foreign direct investment (FDI) and portfolio
            investment financed most of the current account deficits in
            SEE6. Overall, SEE6 countries are having limited success in
            translating the economic recovery into job creation. SEE6
            countries reduced their fiscal deficits to 3.8 percent of
            GDP in 2013 from 4.3 percent of GDP in 2012. The pace of
            fiscal adjustment and still nascent economic growth were
            insufficient to reverse public debt dynamics in SEE6. In a
            low-inflation environment, SEE6 central banks moderately
            loosened monetary policy. The financial sector remained
            broadly stable, albeit fragile, in the course of 2013. The
            SEE region is projected to grow at 1.9 percent in 2014 and
            2.6 percent in 2015 on the back of external demand. The
            positive growth since mid-2013 and the still accommodative
            monetary conditions of the Euro Area are likely to continue
            help SEE6 exports to grow, despite notable risks related to
            the outlook for the Euro Area (related to the slow reform
            implementation and prolonged period of low inflation or risk
            of deflation).
