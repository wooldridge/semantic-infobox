            Regulating water services: sending the
            right signals to utilities in Chile
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            During the 1980s and 1990s the Chilean
            water and sanitation sector underwent deep reforms so that
            private capital could finance the huge investments needed to
            achieve universal service. The regulatory framework put into
            place cleared the way for massive private equity. But users
            have also paid the price of transforming the heavily
            subsidized sector into a self-sustaining industry able to
            provide universal coverage. This Note examines key features
            of the new regulatory scheme that have contributed to the
            sustainability of the reforms: a phased approach, an
            efficient pricing policy and methodology, and expert panels
            to deal with conflict resolution.
