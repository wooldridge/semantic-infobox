BIELSKO-BIALA WATER AND WASTEWATER PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
PART I. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. COUNTRY CONTEXT&#13;
1.1      Poland's economy continues to perform well. According to preliminary estimates, GDP grew&#13;
by some 5.5 percent in 1994 (following a 3.8 percent increase in 1993), and is expected to expand by 5&#13;
percent this year. The growth was largely driven by strong export performance (24 percent on a BOP&#13;
basis) and by sustained investment growth (6 percent increase in fixed capital formation). Due to the&#13;
excellent external performance, the trade deficit was less than US$840 million (an improvement of about&#13;
US$1.5 billion from 1993), resulting in a current account deficit of about 0.8 percent of GDP in 1994.&#13;
Consequently, net international reserves of the banking system remained at comfortable levels (about&#13;
seven months of imports) even after the completion of the debt and debt service reduction operation in&#13;
late 1994. The budget deficit was kept under control in 1994 at about 2.8 percent of GDP. Inflation has&#13;
continued to decline slowly; the year-end inflation rate at slightly below 30 percent remained well above&#13;
the govermment's originally planned target of 24 percent. Unemployment remains high in comparison&#13;
with other countries of Central Europe; it stood at about 16 percent at the end of 1994.&#13;
1.2      Continued economic improvement, with control over inflation and a stable or appreciating&#13;
currency, will have important consequences for the Municipal Water and Wastewater project. Better&#13;
economic conditions and improved incomes will help the utility's customers, both households and&#13;
industrial users, cover the costs of water and wastewater services.&#13;
B. SECTORAL CONTEXT&#13;
Existing Situation&#13;
1.3      Almost all of the Polish population living in urban areas receives public water and sewerage&#13;
services. In many places, however, the quality and reliability of service is deficient and facilities are in&#13;
need of rehabilitation and improvement. Particularly pressing is the need to improve and expand&#13;
wastewater treatment to clean up Poland's heavily polluted water resources. At present Polish water and&#13;
wastewater enterprises are generally weak insdtutions with large potential for efficiency gains in&#13;
management and operation.&#13;
The Challenge Ahead&#13;
1.4      Over the foreseeable future, Poland's water and wastewater enterprises must mobilize large&#13;
financial resources to:&#13;
conserve the achievements of the past by rehabilitating and replacing aging water and&#13;
wastewater infrastructure;&#13;
expand and improve present service levels and the quality of the water offered to the&#13;
public;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
* upgrade and expand wastewater treatment to clean up the country's water resources; and&#13;
modernize and improve the efficiency of utility management and operation.&#13;
1.5       Mobilizing resources to satisfy all investment needs in the sector will be a difficult task and&#13;
require a sustained effort for a long time to come. Optimizing resource mobilization and making the best&#13;
possible use of these resources requires efficient administration and operation of water and wastewater&#13;
enterprises; improved resource mobilization from all sources, particularly from service beneficiaries; and&#13;
prudent investment decisions to reserve scarce resources for least cost and high priority investments.&#13;
1.6       The Local Self Government Act of March 1990 transferred responsibility for water and&#13;
wastewater services to municipal (gmina) governments. With the transfer of assets and the freedom to&#13;
reorganize institutional structures, local governments and their water and wastewater enterprises also have&#13;
acquired the responsibility for improving and expanding services and, as traditional central government&#13;
subsidies have been eliminated, raising resources for funding capital investments as well as maintenance&#13;
and operating costs. The decentralization reforms are providing a unique opportunity to introduce new,&#13;
more efficient institutional structures and policies on the local level for the provision of water and&#13;
wastewater services. Many progressive local governments and enterprise managers have launched&#13;
important initiatives in the right direction-corporatization of water and wastewater enterprises and tariff&#13;
adjustments towards full cost recovery.&#13;
Main Areas of Reform Toward Sector Strengthening&#13;
1.7       The Bank's water and wastewater sector study proposes a comprehensive program of sector&#13;
reform. The following reform measures identified in the sector study are considered key to creating&#13;
strong water and wastewater institutions capable of providing good services at an affordable cost.&#13;
1.8       Transfer municipal water and wastewater enterprises into autonomous commercially rum&#13;
utilities under the regulatory control of local government. Following decentralization of municipal&#13;
services, a number of local governments such as the Bielsko-Biala municipality, have made significant&#13;
advances in giving their enterprises the status of limited liability or even joint stock companies; yet many&#13;
others still withhold the autonomous and commercial status their enterprises need to function effectively.&#13;
One important task to tackle by enterprise management and local government is to define more clearly&#13;
the local government-utility relationship in mutually agreed multi-year performance contracts and business&#13;
plans which formalize the obligations and responsibilities of both parties and provide utilities with the&#13;
freedom to act like commercial enterprises. One of the major goals of the proposed project is to enhance&#13;
utility autonomy.&#13;
1.9      Improve performance and effciency of municipal water and wastewater enterprises&#13;
through well focused technical assistance programs. Large changes in the attitude and knowledge of&#13;
management and staff will be necessary to convert present enterprises into effective utilities. These&#13;
changes, beginning with redefinition and clarification of the local government-utility relationship and&#13;
assumption of a utility business attitude requires determined and sustained efforts to strengthen utility&#13;
management, administration, operation and financial performance through: organizational restructuring;&#13;
adoption of modern utility management practices and systems; increased focus on maintenance and&#13;
operational efficiency, including demand management and leak reduction; adoption of corporate planning&#13;
principles based on multi-year business and investment plans; strengthening financial performance by&#13;
introducing appropriate tariff levels and structures; and increased consumer orientation and services. To&#13;
bring about utility reorganization and strengthening, assistance from qualified Western utilities and&#13;
consulting firms will be essential, at least initially. 'Twinning' arrangements on a commercial, success&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
dependent basis between Polish and foreign successful utilities might be a good vehicle for transfer of&#13;
know-how, management and operational systems. These foreign led assistance programs should eventually&#13;
lead to the development of a strong domestic technical assistance capacity.&#13;
1.10      Promote private sector participation (PSP).  Growing awareness of the often poor&#13;
performance of state-run utilities and the realization that public funds alone cannot meet the large&#13;
investment needs of the sector has led to great interest in involving the private sector in enterprise&#13;
management and investment financing. Over the last four years, PSP schemes have been pursued&#13;
vigorously by foreign and local interests. Several preliminary agreements have been concluded, but only&#13;
one, the joint venture SAUR-local government contract in Gdansk, has come to fruition. All others have&#13;
not materialized for a number of reasons, including the perception of being too expensive, mistrust on&#13;
both sides, and sole-source negotiations leading to suspicions of impropriety. After an initial push, the&#13;
climate for PSP in Poland's water and wastewater sector has cooled, as even the more entrepreneurial&#13;
utility managers and local governments are reluctant to enter into new deals. Despite this temporary lull,&#13;
Poland's water and wastewater sector offers favorable conditions for large-scale PSP in the future.&#13;
Conclusion of more PSP arrangements will depend, however, on an environment of trust developing&#13;
between private sector operators/investors, local governments and enterprises, with government&#13;
encouragement. Above all, local governments need to better understand and become more comfortable&#13;
with the many ways that private sector entry could accelerate improvement of services and bring&#13;
efficiency gains. Expert independent advice is needed to structure arrangements that are perceived as&#13;
being fair and advantageous to both parties. Competition in acquiring PSP and transparency of the&#13;
negotiating process may be a way to counteract negative public opinion. The spread of PSP would be&#13;
accelerated with the development of a local capacity to offer such services. The govermnent and the&#13;
international cooperation community can play an important role in encouraging private sector entry by&#13;
providing advice and encouragement to the sector community and should support specific PSP pilot&#13;
opportunities. The proposed project, and other "first batch" lending operations in the sector, are expected&#13;
to serve as demonstration projects that will help foster an enabling environment for future private sector&#13;
participation.&#13;
1.11      Create a suitable facility for financing utility investments. The speed with which Polish&#13;
water and wastewater utilities can begin to tackle the large investrnents needed depends on their capacity&#13;
to mobilize financial resources from their own cash flow, environmental grants, private equity and&#13;
borrowing. In countries with established financial markets, utilities without any initial debt like those in&#13;
Poland would be able to obtain long-term loans at competitive rates from commercial banks, or be able&#13;
to tap securities markets by issuing equity or bonds. In the short term, however, Poland's incipient&#13;
financial markets are not geared to respond to the sector's long term financing needs and other municipal&#13;
borrowing requirements and direct lending will be required. To overcome the lack of appropriate credit&#13;
facilities, the government with the support of the Bank and other bilateral cooperation institudons is&#13;
working on the creation of a Municipal Credit Program'. The purpose of the MCP will be to help utilides&#13;
and local governments access long-term finance and establish their credit record until the domestic&#13;
financial sector is capable of providing credit for municipal infrastructure. However, it will take several&#13;
years for the program to become fully operational and able to meet the needs of large cides.&#13;
1.12      Introduce appropriate cost recovery and pricing policies. Full recovery of costs, including&#13;
operation, maintenance, depreciadon, finance charges, and opportunity cost on invested equity from user&#13;
charges should become the norm. Over the past few years many Polish water and wastewater enterprises&#13;
have already instituted major tariff increases for water and wastewater, and thereby raised their financial&#13;
1/ See PID dated September 1994 on the proposed Poland Municipal Development Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
capacity close to full cost recovery levels. The city of Bielsko-Biala and others are setting impressive&#13;
examples. Many Polish cities have the potential to reach full cost recovery rates through gradual and&#13;
sustained increases without surpassing people's willingness and capacity to pay.&#13;
1.13      Improve investment planning, evaluation and selection.   Investment planning and&#13;
implementation in the past has been dominated by technical imperatives, often without sufficient concern&#13;
for cost-effectiveness and economic considerations. Better investment selection and evaluation policies&#13;
and processes must be introduced to ensure that the resources available are spent in the most cost-effective&#13;
manner. Making better use of existing systems, setting priorities among investment choices, least-cost&#13;
staging and life cycle costing and affordability considerations must become the guiding principles in&#13;
selecting investments. Before contemplating investments in new capacity, utilities may derive savings by&#13;
considering instead investments in such areas as the reduction of system leakage and water consumption&#13;
combined with operational improvement programs aimed at reducing energy and other input costs. The&#13;
present practice of looking at single component investments such as wastewater treatment plants separate&#13;
from of a utility's other investment needs and overall financial considerations should be replaced with an&#13;
approach that takes a more comprehensive and longer term view of a utility's development objectives,&#13;
investment needs and financial capacity. Master plans and feasibility studies which combine technical,&#13;
financial, institutional and economic considerations should become the basis for defining least-cost and&#13;
affordable multi-year investment plans.&#13;
1.14      Introduce more cost-effective water management policies.  Present effluent quality&#13;
standards from municipal wastewater treatment plants are unnecessarily strict and, in many cases, exceed&#13;
EU standards. Polish standards for wastewater treatment require biological treatment today and plan to&#13;
introduce nutrient removal by the year 2000. For most Polish utilities, providing simple biological&#13;
treatment to all wastewater is technically and financially a difficult task. Adding nutrient removal by the&#13;
year 2000 is unaffordable for most utilities, as tariffs would have to increase to levels which utility&#13;
customers in all likelihood would be unable to pay. The costs associated with advanced treatment far&#13;
exceed the benefits from improved river water quality, especially when considering the opportunity cost&#13;
of other higher priority investments-improving the quality of water supply services, for example-that&#13;
may have to be curtailed.&#13;
1.15      A more rational solution to raising water quality and effluent standards would be to adopt EU&#13;
or similar standards and allow water and wastewater utilities to comply in a phased manner with&#13;
affordability and economic return as decision variables. This principle of phasing and setting clear&#13;
priorities would be in agreement with the recommendation of European governments taken at their&#13;
meeting in Luceme, Switzerland in 1993. Another consideration for optimizing the use of scarce&#13;
resources would be to base resource allocation decisions on a river basin view that identifies priority&#13;
investment opportunities to optimize resource use in terms of ambient water quality improvements. This&#13;
should be reflected in the resource allocation policies of national, regional and municipal environmental&#13;
funds which by providing significant amounts of concessional funds (over US$500 million in 1993 for all&#13;
environmental investments) are an important driving force for investments in wastewater treatnient.&#13;
1.16      In the original design of the country's Water Law, first proposed in 1992, but not yet passed,&#13;
regional water resources authorities modeled after the French Agence du Basin arrangement, were to&#13;
assume an important role in allocating resources in accordance with priority.  Recent political&#13;
developments appear to have stalled this initiative, as control over the allocation of resources has been&#13;
increasingly devolved to the country's 48 regional administrations (Voivodships) and municipalities. The&#13;
dilution of resource allocation authority may lead to investment decisions with insufficient consideration&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
of river basin strategy and priority. While this remains an unresolved issue, it does not affect any&#13;
investment decisions for the proposed project.&#13;
1.17      Strengthen utility business support. In the past, goods and services required by water and&#13;
wastewater utilities have been provided by state-owned engineering and design offices, equipment&#13;
manufacturers and civil works contractors. Not directly accountable to utilities, the performance of these&#13;
enterprises often was deficient in terms of product quality offered. To assist in the development of an&#13;
efficient utility support industry capable of providing quality services and goods at a competitive price,&#13;
many of these entities are in the process of privatization. This process can be sped up if water and&#13;
wastewater utilities procure goods and services on the basis of competition, require internationally&#13;
acceptable technical and performance specifications and conclude contracts that provide effective remedies&#13;
for poor performance.&#13;
Bank's Sector Assistance Strategy&#13;
.18      Assistance to Poland's municipal water and wastewater sector is part of the Bank's Country&#13;
Assistance Strategy. The proposed program for Bank involvement in the sector aims at supporting&#13;
reforms outlined above. It proposes four different specific activities planned for the next three years:&#13;
direct lending operations with the municipal water and wastewater utilities in Bielsko-&#13;
Biala, Wroclaw, Krakow and Bydgoszcz. This first batch of projects is aimed at&#13;
assisting local governments and water and wastewater enterprises in these cities to&#13;
introduce many of the reforms outlined above and to provide benchmark examples for the&#13;
sector in Poland.&#13;
a direct lending operation for water and wastewater in Warsaw. Consultants financed&#13;
under a US$1.5 million grant from EU (PHARE) have been engaged to prepare the&#13;
project and Board presentation in FY98 is possible. A key element of project preparation&#13;
is defining the Warsaw water and wastewater utility's future institutional status, with&#13;
private sector participation in the management of the company being an option&#13;
considered. Anticipating the large investment needs for Warsaw, cofinancing by private&#13;
investors and use of the Bank's guarantee instrument would be pursued.&#13;
smaller scale municipal water and wastewater projects included under the Municipal&#13;
Development Project which is under preparation; wastewater investments for the project&#13;
is under way.&#13;
operations in support of innovative private sector participation; contacts are being&#13;
established with several interested municipal govermnents.&#13;
1.19      These projects are designed to support, on the sector level, many of the elements of the&#13;
Bank's Country Assistance Strategy: decentralization, public sector strengthening, fiscal responsibility,&#13;
environmental protection and private sector participation. The projects are expected to have an important&#13;
demonstration effect for the future development of the water and wastewater utilities in Poland and in&#13;
other countries of Central and Eastern Europe.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
PART II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
2.1       The proposed project would provide support for the water and wastewater enterprise in&#13;
Bielsko-Biala (AQUA), a city of about 190,000 people in the south of the country. It is the first such&#13;
project proposed under the Bank's sector assistance strategy. The project addresses AQUA's key&#13;
development and investment needs: rehabilitating and upgrading the quality and efficiency of water and&#13;
wastewater services, expanding wastewater treatment and improving management and operational&#13;
efficiency. AQUA is a joint stock company, majority owned by the municipal government. A major&#13;
goal of the project is to define more clearly the relationship between AQUA and the municipal&#13;
government in order to enhance the autonomy of utility management. The company has adjusted tariffs&#13;
significantly over the past four years and thereby has acquired the financial capacity to support major&#13;
investments. The attached Project Information and Implementation Document (PIID) provides in Annex&#13;
A a detailed description of Bielsko-Biala's present water and wastewater services, investment needs, and&#13;
an institutional and financial analysis.&#13;
2.2       The project has been prepared by the prospective borrower with the assistance of international&#13;
consultants financed by a bilateral grant. It was identified in late 1992 with feasibility studies initiated&#13;
in late 1993 and completed in September 1994. The project was preappraised in September/October 1994&#13;
and appraised in March/April 1995.&#13;
B. OBJEcrlvEs&#13;
2.3       The overall objective of the project is to strengthen the management and operations of AQUA,&#13;
upgrade water supply and wastewater collection services to improve the living standard and protect the&#13;
health of the people of Bielsko-Biala and expand wastewater treatment to contribute to the clean up of the&#13;
regions's water resources. Specific objectives include:&#13;
Regarding water supply&#13;
* improve the safety, reliability and quality of water supply services to the people of&#13;
Bielsko-Biala by upgrading the functioning of water treatment plants and the water&#13;
transmission and distribution network;&#13;
* improve the efficiency of water production, transmission and distribution systems, thereby&#13;
lowering operating costs through programs of plant and facility rehabilitation and repair,&#13;
operational improvements, unaccounted-for water control (present unaccounted -for water&#13;
is an unacceptably high 37 percent) and reduction of leakage from pipe networks and&#13;
demand management;&#13;
Regarding wastewater coHlection and treatnent&#13;
* improve the safety, reliability and efficiency of the sewer system (pipe networks and&#13;
pumping stations) by initiating programs of system rehabilitation and replacement and&#13;
inflow/infiltration reduction;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
* reduce pollution of local surface water by initiating a program of combined sewer&#13;
overflow reduction;&#13;
* reduce pollutant emissions into the Biala River by providing full biological treatment to&#13;
all wastewater generated in the AQUA service area&#13;
Regarding utility management and operation&#13;
*  assist AQUA to improve its management and operations and strengthen its fiancial&#13;
capacity and commnercial orientation through a program of technical assistance and&#13;
training&#13;
2.4       The project and its objectives are consistent with the proposed sector strategy (para. 1.18) and&#13;
the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board on October 21, 1994. A municipal&#13;
water and wastewater project was specifically mentioned in the CAS. The project would support the CAS&#13;
objectives of financing investments in economic infrastructure at the local level and bring the benefits of&#13;
Bank-financed investments closer to local communities. It also would meet the CAS objective of&#13;
environmental improvement as the project would be instrumental in achieving improved quality of water&#13;
supply provided to the people of Bielsko-Biala and would reduce the amount of pollutants introduced into&#13;
the rivers downstream of the city. The project would foster the CAS objective of enviromnental&#13;
collaboration across municipal boundaries via the involvement of the National Fund for Environmental&#13;
Protection and Water Management (NFEP) as cofmancier and the regional voivodship authority for&#13;
environmental protection, both of whom have participated in the formulation of the project.&#13;

estimated foreign exchange component is US$11.2 million or about 32 percent of total project cost.&#13;
Estimated taxes and duties are US$5.2 million, about 15 percent of total project cost. More detailed cost&#13;
information, including a schedule of annual investments is presented in Annex D of the PID.&#13;
E. FINANCING&#13;
2.7       Flnandng Plan. The summary financing plan for the project is presented in Table 2.2. An&#13;
IBRD LIBOR-based single currency loan in two tranches, US$12 million and DEM 13.2 million, is&#13;
proposed (about US$21.1 million equivalent, or 60 percent of total financing required). The Borrower&#13;
would be AQUA with the sovereign guarantee of the Government of Poland. The loan would finance 100&#13;
percent of the foreign exchange component of the investmnents and about 52 percent of the local&#13;
component excluding taxes and duties. The National Fund for Enviromnental Protection and Water&#13;
Management (NFEP) would cofinance US$7.0 million equivalent in local currency. AQUA would&#13;
contribute US$7.3 million equivalent, about 21 percent of total project cost from its cash generation.&#13;
Components A. 1 and B. 1 of the project, US$4.5 million or 13 percent of total project cost, would not&#13;
be financed by the Bank, as AQUA prefers to execute them under reserved procurement.&#13;

2.8       Cofinandng. The NFEP has agreed to provide US$7.0 million equivalent to cofinance&#13;
investments for the Komorowice and Wapienica wastewater treatment plants. The terms of the loans are:&#13;
17 years maturity, 5.5 years grace and 8 percent fixed interest. These funds will be disbursed pari passu&#13;
with Bank funds for the cofmanced wastewater treatment plants. Effectiveness of the AQUA-NFEP&#13;
agreement would be a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan. Annex E presents information about&#13;
NFEP.&#13;
2.9       Single Currency Loan. AQUA meets the SCL eligibility criteria and the proposed loan falls&#13;
within the 50 percent volume guideline for Poland under the expanded SCL program. AQUA has&#13;
indicated it chose a two-tranche (DEM and US$) SCL to facilitate loan management and servicing. The&#13;
ability to readily determine loan balances during disbursement and repayment was cited by AQUA as an&#13;
advantage of the chosen SCL, and the borrower anticipates better cash flow planning and management&#13;
of the investment process as a result. AQUA expects the two currencies selected would decrease its&#13;
foreign exchange risk and that the DEM and USS will strongly influence the value of its Polish zloty&#13;
revenue. AQUA also believes easy access to DEM and USS in the local market would facilitate loan&#13;
repayment. AQUA selected a LIBOR-based interest rate to retain standard country terms (seventeen years&#13;
repayment with five years grace). To limit exposure to increases in LIBOR, AQUA is considering&#13;
obtaining an interest rate hedge.&#13;
PART m. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. IMLEMENTATION SCHEDULE&#13;
3.1      The project would be implemented during the seven year span 1996-2002. As the Bank is&#13;
just beginning to finance water and wastewater projects in the Region, no comparators exist to judge&#13;
implementation periods. Although the proposed seven year implementation period is below the Bankwide&#13;
average of eight years for water and wastewater projects, the accelerated schedule is considered feasible&#13;
given the technical competence, commitment and financial soundness of the Borrower.&#13;
B. IMPLEMENTATION MANAGEMENT&#13;
3.2       Project Implementation Manager/Unit.  AQUA has appointed a full-time Project&#13;
Implementation Manager (PIM) with overall responsibility for all aspects of project implementation and&#13;
reporting directly to the General Manager. The PIM would lead a Project Implementation Unit (PIU)&#13;
made up of individuals (engineers, accountants, support staff) drawn from the existing company structure.&#13;
The PIU would be assisted by expert consultants to carry out final designs and bidding documents and&#13;
supervise construction. One of the project objectives is the reorganization of the utility's institutional&#13;
structure. Placement of the PIU in AQUA's future organizational structure would be considered carefully&#13;
to ensure the effectiveness of this office, but also to integrate project management into the company's&#13;
routine operation and command stream. AQUA agreed that the PIU headed by a full time qualified&#13;
Project Implementation Manager (PIM) satisfactory to the Bank would be maintained throughout the&#13;
project.&#13;
3.3       Flnal Design, Procurement and Supervision of Construction. Designs exist for all project&#13;
components, but revisions are needed to reflect changes in planning parameters and bring technical&#13;
specifications to international quality standards. Bidding documents satisfactory to the Bank need to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- I1 -&#13;
prepared. AQUA has agreed to adhere to appropriate international standards regarding the preparation&#13;
of final designs and bidding documents and supervision of construction and, assisted by qualified&#13;
consultants satisfactory to the Bank, will design project components other than the initial investments (see&#13;
para. 3.4), prepare bidding documents and supervise construction. AQUA has agreed that the consultants&#13;
would be appointed by June 30, 1996.&#13;
3.4       Preparation of Designs and Bidding Documents for Initial (1996) Investment&#13;
Components. Investments are to start in the second half of 1996. With the approval of the Bank,&#13;
consultants have been engaged to prepare final designs and bidding documents for initial project&#13;
components--the Komorowice and Wapienica wastewater treatment plants and the protection dam at the&#13;
Wapienica water treatment plant. This contract (about US$600,000) would be eligible for retroactive&#13;
Bank financing. Designs and bidding documents for the Komorowice and Wapienica wastewater&#13;
treatment plants and the protection dam at Wapienica are expected to be completed by mid-May 1996.&#13;
3.5       Operational Improvement and Technical Assistance Consultants. The project includes&#13;
consultancies for: (a) institutional reorganization and strengthening (Component C); and (b) the design&#13;
of a program for water and wastewater network rehabilitation and efficiency improvements (Component&#13;
D. 1). To ensure AQUA's ownership of and commitment to the recommendations developed by external&#13;
consultants, the terms of reference emphasize the need for close integration of the consultants with the&#13;
relevant departments and individuals of AQUA. The main task of the consultants will be providing&#13;
expertise currently not available in Poland and guiding and facilitating work carried out largely by AQUA&#13;
staff and the consultant team's Polish experts. An explicit objective of the consultant is to transfer know-&#13;
how to utility personnel through on-the-job training and participation in decision making. Outline terms&#13;
of reference for the technical assistance components are presented in Annex F of the PUD. AQUA has&#13;
agreed to engage qualified consultants satisfactory to the Bank for the operational improvement program&#13;
(Component D. 1) by July 31, 1996, and for the technical assistance program (Component C) by&#13;
December 31, 1996.&#13;
3.6       Budget based investments. Specific investments under the water and wastewater systems&#13;
rehabilitation and operations improvement programs (Components A.3 and B.3) would be determined and&#13;
designed during project execution with the assistance of consultants under Component D. 1 of the project.&#13;
Annually (by June 30 of each year) AQUA would present to the Bank a plan that includes: a description,&#13;
justification, estimated costs and procurement arrangements for investments to be undertaken in the next&#13;
year. AQUA has agreed to adhere to this requirement.&#13;
C. PERFoRMANcE AGREEmENT&#13;
3.7       While AQUA has a legally autonomous status as a joint stock company, ultimnate power is&#13;
held by local government by virtue of majority ownership. A key condition to the success of the project&#13;
is therefore full agreement between the borrower and the municipal government regarding project&#13;
objectives, investments, institutional reforms and financial matters, particularly the authorization of tariff&#13;
increases required to maintain the financial viability of the borrower and the project. AQUA and the&#13;
municipal government have concluded an agreement in which the municipal council authorizes AQUA&#13;
to proceed with the project. In addition to this agreement, AQUA and the municipal government have&#13;
entered into a performance agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, that includes for 1996-2000 annual targets&#13;
for AQUA's management, operations and financial performance. A key element of the performance&#13;
agreement is a tariff adjustment clause that reflects the tariff increases projected to be needed over the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
duration of the project. A binding performance agreement , satisfactory to the Bank, between AQUA&#13;
and the municipal government has been concluded. (Annex F of the PIID).&#13;
D. PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.8       The project elements, their estimated cost and procurement arrangements are summarized in&#13;
Table 3.1. A procurement plan is presented in Annex G of the PID. AQUA will finance the expansion&#13;
of the Zloty Lany water system and the completion of wastewater collectors - costing approximately&#13;
US$4.5 million, about 13 percent of total project cost - from its own sources. These works will be&#13;
procured by AQUA in accordance with applicable Polish procurement regulations. Procurement of the&#13;
remaining project components will be in accordance with Bank guidelines. To the extent practical, items&#13;
to be procured will be grouped into major packages to encourage competitive bidding and to ensure&#13;
standardization. Procurement will be undertaken in the manner described below:&#13;

c - Cofinanced with NFEP&#13;
d - Procured according to "Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and the World&#13;
Bank as Executing Agency' (Washington, DC, August 1981).&#13;
Supply/Install Contracts for the Komorowice and Wapienica Wastewater Treatment Plants&#13;
3.9       The Komorowice and Wapienica wastewater treatment plants - costing approximately US$13.2&#13;
million, (about 37 percent of project cost) - will be constructed under two separate supply and install&#13;
contracts procured under International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance with the&#13;
Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" (January 1995). Due to the&#13;
complexity and large cost there will be a prequalification for the Komorwice Plant. No prequalification&#13;
will be required for the Wapienica Plant. In the evaluation and comparison of bids for equipment&#13;
procured under the supply/installation contract, domestic manufacturers will be granted a 15 percent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
margin of preference or the relevant duty - whichever is lower - in accordance with the industrial formula&#13;
of the Bank guidelines.&#13;
Rehabilitation/Operational Improvement Programs&#13;
3.10      Project components other than the wastewater treatment plants, technical assistance, and&#13;
engineering services - costing approximately US$11.8 million (roughly 33 percent of the total system&#13;
cost) - involve programs for the rehabilitation and operations improvements of the water and sewer&#13;
system. Specific investment interventions under these programs will be identified during project&#13;
implementation with the assistance of expert consultants. Equipment needs and associated works will&#13;
involve a multitude of smaller, diverse investments. This will include equipment for water and&#13;
wastewater treatment plants, water and wastewater pipes and related accessories, pumps and electrical&#13;
equipment, spare parts and tools, water meters and so on. These items will be procured on an as-needed&#13;
basis over several years. In general, procurement will be separate for goods and civil works, although&#13;
in some cases smaller supply/install contracts may be employed. To the extent practical these purchases&#13;
will be grouped into sizable bid packages, enhancing competition and encouraging economy of scale&#13;
savings. AQUA will propose to the Bank by September of each year an investment plan and various&#13;
procurement 'packages' and methods (para. 3.6) for approval prior to implementation. None of the&#13;
contracts under the rehabilitation and operational improvement program require prequalification.&#13;
3.11      Equipment and Materials - US$7.1 million total cost - will be procured through&#13;
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement&#13;
Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" (january 1995). In the evaluation and comparison of bids for&#13;
equipment and materials, domestic manufacturers will be granted a 15 percent margin of preference or&#13;
the relevant duty -whichever is lower - in accordance with Bank guidelines. The exceptions for ICB&#13;
procurement will be as follows:&#13;
*  International Shopping (IS): contracts for equipment and materials estimated to cost less&#13;
than US$300,000 equivalent per package, not to exceed an aggregate amount of US$1.0&#13;
million equivalent, will be awarded under International Shopping procedures, based on&#13;
comparing price quotations obtained from at least three eligible suppliers from at least&#13;
two different countries.&#13;
*  National Shopping (NS): sundry items in smnall quantities not exceeding US$50,000&#13;
equivalent per package up to an aggregate amount of US$1.0 million equivalent will be&#13;
procured through prudent local shopping according to procedures acceptable to the Bank&#13;
by comparing prices obtained from three different potential suppliers.&#13;
3.12      Civil Works - approximately US$4.7 mnillion total cost - will not attract international&#13;
contractors, because of the contracts' small size and the presence of a competitive domestic construction&#13;
industry. They will be procured as follows:&#13;
*  National Competitive Bidding (NCB): Contracts for the rehabilitation and improvement&#13;
of plants and pipelines, estimated to cost less than US$1 million, not to exceed an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$3 million equivalent, will be procured under contracts awarded&#13;
in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 3.3 and 3.4 of Bank Guidelines.&#13;
* Small Works (SW): Works estimated to cost US$200,000 equivalent or less per contract,&#13;
and not to exceed US$2.0 million in the aggregate would be procured under lump sum,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from three qualified&#13;
domestic contractors in response to a written invitation. The invitation shall include a&#13;
detailed description of the works, including basic specifications, the required completion&#13;
date, a basic form of agreement acceptable to the Bank, and relevant drawings, where&#13;
applicable. The award shall be made to the contractor who offers the lowest price&#13;
quotation for the required work, and who has the experience and resources to&#13;
successfully complete the contract.&#13;
Technical Assistance/Training/Engineering Services&#13;
3.13      The Project would include contracts for institutional strengthening and assistance in the&#13;
rehabilitation and operations improvement of the water and wastewater system. Qualified short-listed&#13;
firms would be invited to submit proposals for these consultant services in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
"Guidelines for the Use of Consultants". Engineering services for final design and bidding documents&#13;
for initial investments have already been contracted and will be eligible for retroactive Bank financing&#13;
(see para. 3.4). Engineering services for final designs, procurement and construction supervision of&#13;
remaining project investments would be provided by consultants with qualifications, experience and terms&#13;
of reference satisfactory to the Bank.  These consultants would be contracted according to Bank&#13;
guidelines. Expenditures for external training (travel and per diem expenses, course fees, etc...) for&#13;
AQUA personnel would be financed after Bank approval of an application stating the nature, purpose and&#13;
beneficiary of such training.&#13;
Procurement Management&#13;
3.14      No problems are foreseen in AQUA's ability to implement Bank procurement procedures,&#13;
since international consultants experienced with Bank procurement would assist AQUA throughout the&#13;
procurement process and in the supervision of construction for all project components. AQUA would&#13;
use Bank standard bidding documents for all ICB procurement and supply and install contracts, and other&#13;
relevant documents.  The Government has issued public procurement regulations emphasizing a&#13;
requirement for competitive procedures. Currently the Bank is preparing a Country Procurement Review.&#13;
Procurement Review&#13;
3.15      Bank will conduct a prior review of procurement packages for: (a) each contract for goods&#13;
estimated to cost the equivalent of US$300,000 or more, (b) the first two contracts for works estimated&#13;
to cost the equivalent of US$300,000 or more, and (c) each contract for works estimated to cost the&#13;
equivalent of US$500,000 or more, in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 of Appendix 1 of Bank&#13;
Guidelines. Regarding the employment of consultants, the Bank will conduct a prior review of budgets,&#13;
short lists, selection procedures, letters of invitation, proposals, evaluation reports and contracts for&#13;
contracts with consulting firms to cost more than US$100,000 and for individual consultants to cost more&#13;
than US$50,000. Terms of reference will be reviewed for all consulting assignments as well as&#13;
amendments to existing contracts exceeding US$100,000 for the employment of consulting firms and&#13;
US$50,000 for the employment of individual consultants.&#13;
E. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
3.16      For goods, the Bank loan would finance 100 percent of foreign and local expenditures (ex-&#13;
factory cost) and 85 percent of local expenditures for other items procured locally. For civil works, the&#13;
loan would finance 70 percent of expenditures under Components A.2, A.3 and B.3, and 30 percent of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
expenditures under Component B.2. For eligible consulting/engineering services, the loan would finance&#13;
90 percent of expenditures. A loan disbursement and allocation schedule is presented in Annex H of the&#13;
PIID.&#13;
3.17     To facilitate timely project implementation, AQUA would establish, maintain and operate,&#13;
under conditions acceptable to the Bank, two Special Accounts, one denominated in US$, the other in&#13;
DEM. Initially the allocations would be limited to US$500,000 for the US$ Special Account and DEM&#13;
800,000 for the DEM Special Account. When aggregate disbursements under the Loan equal or exceed&#13;
US$5.0 million equivalent, the allocations may be increased to US$1.0 million for the US$ Special&#13;
Account and DEM 1.5 million for the DEM Special Account by submitting the relevant Application for&#13;
Withdrawal. Replenishment applications would be submitted at least every three months and include&#13;
reconciled bank statements as well as other appropriate supporting documents.&#13;
3.18      Reimbursement of expenditures for contracts below US$500,000 equivalent for civil works&#13;
and US$300,000 equivalent for goods, would be made on the basis of statements of expenditure (SOEs).&#13;
The documentation to support these expenditures would be retained by the PIM. The documentation&#13;
would be audited by independent auditors and made available for review by the Bank upon request.&#13;
Applications for withdrawals against contracts valued at more than the above thresholds would be fully&#13;
documented.&#13;
3.19     The loan would provide retroactive financing, not to exceed US$1.0 million equivalent for&#13;
engineering services (preparation of designs and bidding documents for initial investments, para. 3.4)&#13;
and works for the strengthening of the flood protection dam for the Wapienica water treatment plant&#13;
(Component A.2 of the project), for eligible payments made after August 1, 1995.&#13;
3.20     The project is expected to disburse fully over six years. The expected completion date of the&#13;
project is December 31, 2002. The closing date of the project would be June 30, 2003.&#13;
3.21     AQUA has agreed to adhere to the above disbursement and document review arrangements.&#13;

F. ENvEoNmENTAL IMPACr&#13;
3.22     The Project is classified in Environnental Screening Category "B" requiring sub-project&#13;
environmental analysis, consistent with the Bank's guideline OD4.01. The analysis reveals the project&#13;
would generate significant environmental benefits with no negative impacts anticipated. Because all&#13;
construction would proceed on sites already in use, there are no resettlement issues. The proposed&#13;
investments in wastewater treatment are based on a phased plan of implementation with secondary&#13;
biological treatment provided under the project and nutrient removal requiring advanced treatment in a&#13;
next phase to be initiated after completion of this project. The Voivodship Environmental Department&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
in charge of issuing permits for the proposed wastewater treatment investments and AQUA have signed&#13;
an agreement on the phased approach, committing the Environmental Department to issue operating&#13;
permits for the Komorowice and Wapienica wastewater treatment plants, once they are in operation.&#13;
Annex I presents a copy of the agreement. AQUA has not received and does not anticipate to receive&#13;
any adverse public reaction to the proposed investments.&#13;
3.23      Bielsko-Biala is located in southern Poland in the Biala river valley. The main objective of&#13;
the project is to rehabilitate, expand and improve the functioning of Bielsko-Biala's water and wastewater&#13;
systemns. The project would not have any harmful effect on downstream riparians; on the contrary it&#13;
would reduce water use and the pollution load discharged. The project is unaffected by any riparian's&#13;
water use. The project therefore presents no issue in terns of Bank guideline OP/BP7.50.&#13;
G. ACCOUNTS AND AuDnTs&#13;
3.24      Accounting and financial management practices in AQUA are evolving. Financial statements&#13;
are prepared according to national standards and independently audited. Financial reports prepared by&#13;
AQUA do not allow identification of itemized costs by activity and a system of cost accounting to&#13;
facilitate business management is required. Improved financial performance reporting and more effective&#13;
management of funds would be provided by investments planned under the institutional strengthening&#13;
component (Component C).&#13;
3.25      The utility would establish and maintain its accounting system in accordance with sound and&#13;
internationally recognized accounting principles and practices acceptable to the Bank to provide interim&#13;
financial reports and annual financial statements that reflect the financial performance and position of the&#13;
project and the utility, from the commencement of project execution. The periodic financial reports&#13;
would include a comparison of actual and projected costs for the current period and for the total project&#13;
to date. An auditor's opinion and reports satisfactory to the Bank on the annual financial statements&#13;
would be provided within six months of the close of the fiscal year. The auditor's report would include&#13;
a statement on the adequacy or otherwise of the accounting system and internal controls, the reliability&#13;
of statements of expenditures as a basis for loan disbursements, and compliance with financial covenants.&#13;
The foregoing accounting, financial reporting, and auditing arrangements would provide adequate and&#13;
timely information to the Bank for supervision of the project. AQUA has agreed to adhere to the above&#13;
stipulations regarding accounting and auditing.&#13;
H. SUPERVISION AND MONrrORING&#13;
3.26      Intensive supervision by the Bank would be required initially. The supervision effort is&#13;
expected to reduce as the borrower gains experience. On average, about twelve staff-weeks would be&#13;
sufficient to supervise the project, but more would be required in the early years (Table 3.3).&#13;
Supervision economies would be sought by relying on the Bank Resident Mission in Warsaw for in-field&#13;
consultations.&#13;

3.27       By March 31 and September 30 of each year, the borrower would submit to the Bank semi-&#13;
annual reports on implementation progress during the preceding semester, including a summary of&#13;
implementation status as measured against the project implementation schedule, pro-forma financial&#13;
statements for the utility, project and the special accounts, progress in the implementation of investment&#13;
and technical assistance components, status of compliance with loan conditions and technical, institutional&#13;
and financial monitoring indicators. Monitoring indicators, presented in Annex J of the PIID, are targets&#13;
reflected in the performance agreement between the borrower and local government. Progress would be&#13;
evaluated by the Bank during its regular project supervision. By December 31, 1998, the borrower and&#13;
the Bank jointly would undertake a formal mid-term review of implementation progress and compliance&#13;
with loan conditions. Within six months of the loan closing date, the borrower would submit an&#13;
implementation completion report that includes a plan for future operation of the project. AQUA has&#13;
agreed to adhere to these reporting and review requirements.&#13;
PART IV. FINANCIAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
4.1        AQUA's sound financial position reflects competent management, responsible tariff policies&#13;
pursued by its municipal regulator, and a debt-free initial balance sheet. In the absence of debt service&#13;
charges, AQUA is able to generate substantial net cash, but would need continued tariff adjustments to&#13;
buttress its investment and borrowing capacity, while keeping control of recurrent costs. A 10-year&#13;
financial projection (see Annex K of the PlID) shows that with such tariff adjustments, AQUA could build&#13;
upon its present financial position with the proposed project and loan.&#13;
4.2        Positive factors in AQUA's financial outlook are the scope for labor productivity gains (a 7.5&#13;
percent reduction of staff through attrition is projected for the period 1996-2001) and savings in water&#13;
losses and energy use pursued under the project. Factors expected to burden the utility's costs include&#13;
likely increases in electricity rates and the incremental costs of improving wastewater treatment and sludge&#13;
management.&#13;
4.3       In preparation for investments to be made under the project, AQUA has begun to raise tariffs&#13;
substantially. Average tariffs for 1991-1995 are:&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
In January 1995 average real water tariffs increased almost 13 percent, while average real wastewater&#13;
tariffs increased 20 percent, with real residential tariffs for water and wastewater increasing about 25&#13;
percent in real terms. Tariffs would continue to increase in real terms during the project at an average&#13;
annual rate of 6 percent, and at inflation thereafter.  Because industrial users have borne a&#13;
disproportionate share of costs, residential tariffs would rise more than the average, increasing 10 percent&#13;
annually in real terms throughout the implementation period. Despite these increases, residential tariffs&#13;
would pass affordability tests at 2 percent of household income through 2005. Tariffs for industrial users&#13;
would increase 5 percent annually during implementation, and thereafter decrease in real terms. The&#13;
decrease would grow from -3.9 percent in 2001 to -7.5 percent in 2005. With these changes, the&#13;
industrial:residential water tariff ratio would improve from 4.6 in 1995 (16,900/3700) to 1.7&#13;
(36,000/21,100) in 2005. Tariffs for government users would increase during project implementation,&#13;
with a 10 percent real increase in 1996 tapering to 6.5 percent in 2000. Thereafter government tariffs&#13;
would be kept at inflation. Tariffs for other customers (wholesale accounts) would be 5 percent above&#13;
inflation during implementation, and at inflation thereafter.&#13;
4.4        These adjustments would improve returns on assets (from 3.5 percent in 1995 to 7.2 percent&#13;
in 2000), send clearer price signals encouraging water conservation and help phase down cross-subsidies&#13;
from industrial users. AQUA would be able to finance its operations and maintenance cost and provide&#13;
timely debt service and counterpart funding throughout the period of the project, and after the project is&#13;
completed, generate sufficient net cash to self-finance a significant level of investment-or, more likely,&#13;
continue borrowing prudently and invest at a faster pace.&#13;
4.5       A sensitivity analysis performed to assess the potential impact of foreign exchange and interest&#13;
rate risks on AQUA shows that debt service coverage would remain viable in the event of a 30 percent&#13;
increase in these factors, with the debt service coverage ratio falling to 2.7 in 2002 (compared to a low&#13;
of 3.6 in the base case). AQUA also would remain solvent, though its investment capacity would be&#13;
substantially affected, in the event of revenues 15 percent lower than the base case projection.&#13;
4.6        To ensure that the parameters of this assessment hold true, AQUA has agreed that it would:&#13;
(a) would maintain working ratios not higher than 0.65 in any financial year throughout the&#13;
project and&#13;
(b) would obtain Bank consent before committing any major investmnent (US$5 million) other&#13;
than the project; and&#13;
(c) would refrain from any new borrowing that would bring its projected debt service&#13;
coverage ratio below 1.50 in any financial year.&#13;
PART V. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. BENEFrrS&#13;
5.1       As a result of the project, consumers would receive more reliable, safer and better quality&#13;
water and wastewater services. The institutional strengthening, network rehabilitation and operational&#13;
improvements would result in higher system efficiency and improved productivity, thereby helping to&#13;
contain the cost to the consumer for services. Of equal, if not greater value, is the significant positive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
environmental benefit that would be obtained. The project would support an investment program to&#13;
provide biological treatment for all wastewater generated in Bielsko-Biala and thereby reduce pollution&#13;
discharged into the Biala and Vistula rivers. The project would include other smaller, but still important&#13;
environmental improvements, such as the initiation of combined sewer overflow control programs to&#13;
reduce pollution discharges, the introduction of a more effective monitoring program for industrial&#13;
wastewater discharges to help reduce toxic emissions and the connection of several thousand people to&#13;
the sewer system. Another important positive impact is the demonstration effect in a number of areas&#13;
identified as crucial for the sector reform, including creation of an autonomous utility, introduction of&#13;
modern utility management and administration, adoption of full cost recovery principles, and multi-year&#13;
least cost business planning and investment program identification.&#13;
5.2       These economic benefits can be put into perspective by examining the situation in Bielsko-&#13;
Biala without the project. Without the project's rehabilitation work--a significant share of both water and&#13;
wastewater components-operations and maintenance costs for these systems would escalate. In an&#13;
extreme case, conditions could so severely deteriorate that water and wastewater service to residential and&#13;
industrial customers would be jeopardized, with serious consequences for public health and production&#13;
losses by industry. Failure to support project investments in wastewater treatment would result in&#13;
continued degradation of the immediate receiving waters.&#13;
B. NET PRESENT VALUE&#13;
5.3       The nature of project investments-rehabilitation and operational improvement of existing&#13;
systems-and related environmental benefits does not allow calculation of a complete economic rate of&#13;
return. Detailed information quantifying the environmental impact of existing pollution from wastewater,&#13;
and consequent benefits from improved wastewater treatment, are not available. As proxy the net present&#13;
value of the project's financial flows has been used to provide indication of minimum economic value.&#13;
With conservative assumptions and discounting at 10 percent, a base case analysis suggests a US$31.5&#13;
million net present value. In a more adverse enviromnent, with capital and operating and maintenance&#13;
costs up 20 percent throughout the projection period, net present value still would remain positive. With&#13;
an independent increase of these variables, positive net value would be preserved with capital costs&#13;
increasing 50 percent or operating and maintenance costs increasing 30 percent. These results, together&#13;
with a return on revalued fixed assets exceeding 6 percent, the solid financial performance projected for&#13;
the company and substantial non-quantified benefits all support the project's real economic worth.&#13;
Assumptions and calculations for the net present value analysis are shown in Annex L of the PID.&#13;
C. AFFoRDABILITY&#13;
5.4       Despite recent and projected increases in residential tariffs, water and wastewater services&#13;
would remain affordable in Bielsko-Biala. The 1995 water tariff for residential use is PLN 0.3700/m3&#13;
(US$0.16) and PLN 0.3100 (US$0.13) for wastewater service. The affordability of increased tariffs has&#13;
been assessed by categorizing households as either "working" (category I) or "retired" (category II). On&#13;
average Category I households have more persons, more workers and fewer pensioners than those in&#13;
Category II. Using national averages for the composition of category I and II households, average net&#13;
monthly salary and pension data specific to Bielsko-Biala, IBRD projections of real growth in average&#13;
incomes, and consumption and tariff projections for the project, the affordability analysis indicates the&#13;
combined charge for water and wastewater services as a percentage of household income would be:&#13;

II             1.0%       1.3%      1.7%&#13;
Throughout the period of projection, water and wastewater expenditure would not exceed 1.7 percent of&#13;
average net household income, for both working and retired households. By way of comparison, for the&#13;
average Polish household, 2.7 percent of expenditure is for alcohol and tobacco.'&#13;
5.5      In order to assess the impact of projected tariffs on lower income groups, the affordability&#13;
analysis was modified using minimum wage and minimum pension data. In this case the results are:&#13;
Household Category    1996       2000       2005&#13;
I             2.6 %      3.3 %     4.4 %&#13;
11            2.0 %      2.5 %      3.4 %&#13;
or very roughly about three times the average 'worker" household and twice the average 'pension'&#13;
household. Throughout the projection period water and wastewater expenditure for this low income group&#13;
would remain below 5 percent of net disposable income, a general Bank threshold affordability for the&#13;
sector.&#13;
5.6       Above calculations for average and low income households incorporate an average rate of&#13;
water consumption. It is likely, however, that low income households consume less water than average,&#13;
particularly if these households have fewer water-intensive appliances and facilities. If the consumption&#13;
of low income households for example is two-thirds that of an average household, then the affordability&#13;
profile becomnes:&#13;

H             1.3 %       1.7 %     2.3 %&#13;
giving further evidence of the affordability of proposed tariff increases. Assumptions and calculations&#13;
underlying the affordability analysis are contained in Annex M of the PHD.&#13;
D. RIsKS&#13;
5.7       Overall the project has moderate risks. AQUA is fully committed to project institutional,&#13;
financial and physical objectives, and local government is similarly supportive. The company enjoys a&#13;
strong financial capacity, good management and staff who supported by consultants should be able to&#13;
carry out the project as planned. While there is always risk that local govermnent may compromise utility&#13;
autonomy for political gain, the good will of the municipality demonstrated by a performance agreement&#13;
between the AQUA and local government minimizes this risk. Because of borrower competence and&#13;

commitment, other significant risks are not foreseeable, and close project monitoring is planned to detect&#13;
and address any problems early on.&#13;

ANNEX A&#13;
ASSESSMENT OF PRESENT SITUATION,&#13;
ISSUES AND CONSTRAINTS, NEED FOR ACTION&#13;
A. WATER SERVICES&#13;
1.   The City of Bielsko-Biala, situated in southern Poland and capital of the Bielsko-Biala voivodship,&#13;
has a present population of about 190,000. Bielsko-Biala's water and wastewater enterprise, AQUA, is&#13;
responsible for providing water supply and wastewater services in the area. AQUA would be the&#13;
borrower and executing agency for the project. This document reflects developments through project&#13;
negotiation (November 1995) and incorporates analyses and recommendations in feasibility studies&#13;
prepared by international consultants (available in the project files).&#13;
Service Coverage, Consumption, Metering, Losses&#13;
2.   AQUA provides water supply by house connection to nearly 100 percent of its service population,&#13;
approximately 95 percent of whom live within the city limits. The great majority of the population&#13;
receives uninterrupted supply save for some pockets where transmission and distribution is deficient (Zlote&#13;
Lany) area. AQUA also delivers water to industry and bulk supplies to some communities in the area;&#13;
Czechowice-Dziedzce with about 18,000 m3/day is the biggest. Although reliable production metering&#13;
is lacking and information on domestic consumption is inconsistent, a fairly accurate picture of&#13;
consumption and losses for 1994 is presented in Table Al.&#13;
Table Al: Water Production and Use&#13;

3.     Water consumption has decreased in recent years and total production has fallen from about&#13;
164,000 m3/day in 1992, to 157,000 m3/day in 1993, to about 155,000 m3/day in 1994. Most of the&#13;
decrease is attributable to the decline and restructuring of industry and accompanying water use&#13;
reductions. According to AQUA, the high rate of unaccounted-for-water is caused mostly by leakage&#13;
from the pipe network, as all consumers, including municipal agencies responsible for park lawn irrigation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
and street cleaning trucks, are equipped with water meters. Bringing down unaccounted-for-water is a&#13;
big challenge for AQUA in the future and therefore an important project objective. The project includes&#13;
the planning and implementation of an unaccounted-for-water control program. Part of this program will&#13;
be a more reliable analysis of water production, use and losses, which may lead to revision of the figures&#13;
presented in Table Al.&#13;
4.      AQUA reports over 21,000 consumption meters (1993), of which 18,600 are for domestic&#13;
supply. With about one meter per ten people, this coverage is remarkable for Eastern Europe. Data for&#13;
each water meter are stored in a computerized system. Meters are recertified every six years for domestic&#13;
and four years for industrial consumers. Annually about 800 meters are replaced and 4,000 repaired.&#13;
Demand Forecast&#13;
5.      Demographic studies forecast that the city's population will stay stable for the foreseeable future.&#13;
An annual growth rate of 0.7 percent per year is projected. Further industrial restructuring and&#13;
diversification induced by recent economic and political reforms is expected, but future industrial&#13;
development should not generate significantly more water demand, and industrial consumption is projected&#13;
to remain constant. Current domestic consumption rates of about 180 I/c/d approximate those in most&#13;
of Western Europe', but further declines are expected as increases in tariffs and demand management&#13;
measures take place. Sales to government and wholesale accounts are projected to increase in line with&#13;
the growth in general population. Programs for reducing unaccounted-for-water are expected to reduce&#13;
production requirements. A sunimary of projected production and demand is presented in Table A2.&#13;

Water Production/Treatment&#13;
6.      Water Sources. AQUA receives about 85 percent of its water from the Sola River, and the rest&#13;
from other smaller rivers coming out of the mountainous areas south of Bielsko-Biala. In general the raw&#13;
water available to AQUA is of fairly good quality, although there is some concern about upstream&#13;
discharges creating bacteriological contamination of the Sola River and the watershed for the Czaniec&#13;
Reservoir, the water source for the entire Sola River water treatment complex. The river water is&#13;
moderately hard, turbid and colored, with large seasonal variations. It contains appreciable concentrations&#13;
of iron and manganese, but there is no contamination by organic compounds, solvents or metals. In&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
summary, AQUA's raw water supply is acceptable in terms of both quantity and quality, but careful&#13;
monitoring must be continued to detect any problems early.&#13;
7.     Water Treatment Plants. AQUA operates three main water treatment plants, Kobiernice (also&#13;
known as "Sola"), Wapienica and Szczyrk. Together they have a nominal capacity of about 200,000&#13;
m3/day, with Kobiernice the largest at a capacity of about 130,000 m3/day. All plants use rapid sand&#13;
filtration with chlorination; part of the Kobiernice plant depends on pretreatment through infiltration&#13;
lagoons adjacent to the Sola River. All plants are manually operated with essentially no automation,&#13;
maintenance is deficient, and perhaps the most important drawback and source of inefficiency is the lack&#13;
of adequate process control.&#13;
Water Pumping/Transmission/Distribution System&#13;
8.     The principal trunk main network comprises approximately 180 km of pipe between 300 mm and&#13;
1,200 mm diameter, including unlined cast iron pipes laid between 1900 and 1993 (85 percent), unlined&#13;
steel pipes laid between 1900 and 1993 (12 percent) and asbestos cement pipes laid between 1945 and&#13;
1965 (3 percent). There are 1,070 km of distribution mains of generally less than 300 mm diameter,&#13;
predominately unlined cast iron pipes laid between 1900 and 1993 (90 percent). The pipe network is&#13;
reported to be in serviceable condition, particularly larger diameter mains, but a comprehensive physical&#13;
survey of the system is needed to obtain more reliable information on the state of the network. There are&#13;
indications that tuberculation and corrosion is widespread, particularly in the smaller pipes. Because&#13;
damage to the network is frequent and the present pipe setup makes zone isolation difficult, repairing&#13;
bursts on major mains requires sending water by alternate routes with rapid changes in flow velocity and&#13;
direction. As a result, consumers frequently experience "red water" problems, as products of internal&#13;
corrosion and the carry-over of matter from inefficient treatment processes contaminate water in the&#13;
system. AQUA receives some 700 complaints a year about discoloration of water and sediment.&#13;
Investment Priorities&#13;
9.     AQUA has identified the following priority investments needs:&#13;
Water Treatment: Existing plant capacity is sufficient for present and future demand;&#13;
capacity expansions are not needed. The main task ahead is to improve plant operations and&#13;
efficiency. The project will include financing for plant rehabilitation and operational&#13;
improvements.&#13;
Service Expansion: Resources need to be allocated to extend water service to areas currently&#13;
unconnected or poorly served, particularly the Zlote Lany district.&#13;
*Pumping/transmission/distribution system improvements: Investments are needed to make&#13;
water supply more secure, improve water quality, reduce leakage and increase the overall&#13;
hydraulic efficiency of the system. The project therefore would support the initiation of&#13;
sustained programs of pipe rehabilitation and replacement, leak detection and repair and&#13;
hydraulic network efficiency improvements to reduce pipe failures, water quality problems&#13;
and operating costs. To ensure cost effectiveness, investments would be selected on the basis&#13;
of a detailed system survey, energy audits at pumping stations and system evaluation and&#13;
optimization using computerized modeling.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

B. WASTEWATER SERVICES&#13;
Service Area and Population Served&#13;
10.   Wastewater collection is provided to the most densely populated areas of Bielsko-Biala. Of the&#13;
total 187,000 people served with water (1994), about 157,000 have a sewer connection. Those not served&#13;
have on-site solutions or use local and individual small systems collecting water into holding tanks that&#13;
should be emptied regularly and brought to a wastewater treatment plant, but in practice often pollute&#13;
small local streams. Programs are under way to connect unserved households to the sewer system as main&#13;
collectors are extended.&#13;
Wastewater CoUection&#13;
11.    Bielsko-Biala is situated in the valley of the Biala River with the general slope of the area&#13;
converging to the river which bisects the town. All sewers flow by gravity to two main collectors, on&#13;
each side of the river. Eventually these collectors combine into one 1,200 mm collector which directs&#13;
the flow to the Komorowice wastewater treatment plant.&#13;
12.    Most of the sewers are constructed from concrete, cast iron and clay and are reported to be in&#13;
fair condition. Operations and maintenance consists of reactive measures and sewer cleaning. There are&#13;
about 330 km of sewers and collectors in the area served by AQUA. The central portion of the Bielsko-&#13;
Biala system is primarily composed of combined sewers, while outlying areas and all sewers constructed&#13;
since 1968 are separate systems. AQUA has responsibility for the combined and separate wastewater&#13;
sewers and, under contract with the municipality, also operates and maintains the separate storm sewers.&#13;
Combined sewer overflows reportedly are not a current concern, but will have to be reduced in the&#13;
medium and long term future. Low BOD concentration in the inflow to wastewater treatment plants,&#13;
large dry weather flows and other evidence suggests infiltration and inflow (I/I) is a major problem. I/I&#13;
is estimated to be on the order of 50 percent of the total dry weather flow. I/I reduction is an important&#13;
objective for AQUA, particularly to reduce capacity requirements and reduce operating costs for&#13;
wastewater treatment.&#13;
13.   Investment Priorities/Strategy. Investments for sewer system improvement and I/I reductions&#13;
clearly are priority investment needs. To ensure that these investments are made in a cost effective and&#13;
prioritized way, a better understanding of the physical state of the system and its hydraulic performance&#13;
are required. Toward this end, AQUA will carry out under the project:&#13;
a comprehensive physical survey of the sewer system&#13;
a program of flow measurement throughout the system and&#13;
development of a computerized hydraulic simulation model2 based on the sewer survey and&#13;
flow measurements.&#13;
14.   This information will be used to prepare and begin the implementation of a phased program of&#13;
sewer cleaning, repair and rehabilitation, and pumping station refurbishment to increase hydraulic&#13;
performance of the system, reduce infiltration and inflow and decrease combined sewer overflows.&#13;
7/ A calibrated computer model is an essential tool to understand the system's functioning and to determine additional cost&#13;
effective improvements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
Wastewater Treatment&#13;
15.   Komorowice, originally designed in 1964, is Bielsko-Biala's main wastewater treatment plant with&#13;
a nominal capacity of about 120,000 m3/day; however, due to hydraulic limitations, the biological&#13;
treatment capacity is 40,000 m3/day. Komorowice should meet current effluent standards of 30 mg/l&#13;
BOD, 30 mg/l total suspended solids and 5 mg/l phosphorous, but the plant, heavily overloaded with an&#13;
average dry weather flow of 105,000 m3/day, is not meeting these standards. The Ministry of&#13;
Environmental Protection has refused to provide a permit for the plant and AQUA is obliged to pay heavy&#13;
fines. Recently, AQUA has begun the construction of the first phase of a new treatment plant at&#13;
Wapienica to provide 8,000 m3/day of primary and biological treatment.&#13;
16.   Investment Priorities/Strategy. AQUA plans to bring full wastewater treatment to Bielsko-Biala&#13;
in three phases:&#13;
Phase 1 (by the year 2000):&#13;
double the biological treatment capacity of the Komorowice plant and complete the Wapienica&#13;
plant to provide primary treatment and biological treatment for about 80 percent of&#13;
wastewater generated in Bielsko-Biala&#13;
Phase 2 (by the year 2005):&#13;
provide primary and secondary biological treatment for all wastewater generated in Bielsko-&#13;
Biala&#13;
Phase 3 (by the year 2010):&#13;
provide primary and secondary treatment, and nutrient removal for all Bielsko-Biala's&#13;
wastewater&#13;
C. INSTiTUTIONAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
Corporate Governance&#13;
17.   AQUA is registered as a joint stock company. In this position it enjoys wide autonomy, although&#13;
local government, as owner of the company, retains ultimate power over important decisions relating to&#13;
tariff levels and major investments.  AQUA management and local government have a good&#13;
understanding, work together responsibly and respect each other's prerogatives. Yet more clearly spelled&#13;
out obligations and responsibilities of both parties would help preserve this harmony. Therefore the&#13;
project would require a performance agreement between the partners, including monitorable indicators&#13;
defining AQUA's commitment to improve management, administration, finances and operations.&#13;
Instiutonal Strengthening&#13;
18.   By Polish standards, AQUA is a well run and efficient company.  Nevertheless, many&#13;
improvements are possible. Based on an in-depth assessment of AQUA's management and administration,&#13;
consultants have proposed a number of actions designed to turn AQUA into a utility meeting management&#13;
and operations standards on par with the better Western European utilities. Actions recommended by&#13;
consultants entail:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
a clearer mission statement with aims and targets for definition of company autonomy,&#13;
accountability, quality of service, pricing of service and cost recovery, efficiency of&#13;
operations (demand management, leak detection, least-cost planning and appropriate&#13;
technology) and customer satisfaction;&#13;
a more effective organizational structure with definition of responsibilities, job profiles and&#13;
descriptions, staffing and internal interaction among company units;&#13;
* improved leadership skills and competencies for all levels of management and staff to&#13;
introduce a "corporate culture" aimed at improving efficiency in the company's management&#13;
and operations;&#13;
* a public relations capability, including proactive strategy and plan to improve the public image&#13;
of the company;&#13;
* better human resources development, including contracts for directors, job descriptions,&#13;
performance standards, recruitment and training programs and processes;&#13;
* improved asset management, with asset titling, registration, valuation, maps/plans, and&#13;
insurance;&#13;
increased staff productivity by upgrading management and staff competence and gradually&#13;
reducing overstaffing through attrition; the present indicator of about 3.5 employees per 1000&#13;
people served is significantly higher than found at efficient utilities in the Western Europe;&#13;
multi-year comprehensive business planning to improve AQUA performance with short,&#13;
medium and long term monitorable management and operational targets;&#13;
upgraded computer-based management and administrative systems, including systems for&#13;
management information and control, budgeting, cost accounting, customer service and&#13;
commercial operations, stocks, implemented in accordance with an integrated computerization&#13;
study; and&#13;
a new tariff structure to assure sufficient revenue generation and promotion of water&#13;
conservation.&#13;
Human Resources/Staffing&#13;
19.    AQUA management is confident, energetic, highly motivated, enthusiastic and in control.&#13;
Managers are well aware of the institutional weaknesses of the company. Management desires to turn&#13;
AQUA into a modem utility with private sector involvement-a view shared by the political leadership&#13;
of the city. AQUA's staff is well trained in technical matters, but knowledge in many areas of modem&#13;
utility management and operation can be improved, particularly in financial control and management,&#13;
corporate planning, business skills and commercial practices. AQUA greatest asset is its people;&#13;
management eager to introduce a new commercial attitude and staff willing to follow, but requiring proper&#13;
instruction, and administrative and operational tools.&#13;
20.   At present AQUA employs about 650 people or about 3.5 people per 1000 population. Of the&#13;
total employees, about 110 work in AQUA's construction department which is run as a separate profitable&#13;
business. AQUA asserts that its construction department is today the most efficient and experienced&#13;
construction unit in the Bielsko-Biala area. AQUA would like to spin off its construction arm, but is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
reluctant to do so because AQUA can avoid VAT taxes by doing construction in house. Subtracting the&#13;
construction department employees, the employees per 1000 population declines to about 2.8. This ratio&#13;
is still high compared to the more automated and efficient utilities in Westem Europe and North America.&#13;
AQUA management is aware of the fact that it is overstaffed and intends to bring down its number of&#13;
staff through attrition.&#13;
Direction for the Future&#13;
21.   AQUA management realizes that company performance can be substantially improved. It seeks,&#13;
therefore technical assistance by an experienced group of foreign utility practitioners to help the company&#13;
elaborate and implement identified institutional strengthening measures.&#13;
22.   In the long run, local government and AQUA are interested in bringing in private capital. The&#13;
proposed project would allow AQUA to demonstrate to the private sector that it can perform as a&#13;
successful business. Preparing the company for the private sector by strengthening corporate autonomy,&#13;
commercial discipline and asset improvement in a fast but controllable pace fits with a general strategy&#13;
supported by many in Poland to bring in gradually private management and financing of public services.&#13;

ANNEX C&#13;
OUTLINES OF TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
A. MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION STRENGTHENING&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The Water and Wastewater Company of Bielsko-Biala (AQUA) is undertaking a Bank supported&#13;
program of investments to improve and expand its water and wastewater services. An equally important&#13;
part of the project is an institutional strengthening component aimed at helping AQUA to improve its&#13;
management and administration. For this purpose, AQUA wishes to retain expert foreign assistance to&#13;
assist in the planning and imnplementation of a program of reorganization and institutional strengthening.&#13;
In support of this effort, the Bank loan includes funding for consulting services, the acquisition of&#13;
equipment and external training of management and staff.&#13;
2.    In preparation of the Bank project, other consultants have already undertaken an in-depth&#13;
assessment of AQUA's present institutional performance and have developed a number of specific&#13;
recommnendations which have been endorsed in principle by the company. This information should&#13;
therefore be taken as a starting point of this consulting program.&#13;
3.    In parallel, the company is undertaking, with the assistance of other consultants, programs for the&#13;
rehabilitation and operational improvement of its water and wastewater systems. As there are overlapping&#13;
interests between these efforts and the institutional strengthening program, consultants in charge of these&#13;
programs are to coordinate their efforts.&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
4.    The main objective of this consulting assignment is thus to assist AQUA in the planning, design&#13;
and implementation of a comprehensive program for institutional restructuring, introducing more efficient&#13;
organization and management systems accompanied by training of AQUA management and staff. The&#13;
responsibility of the consultant is to assist AQUA management develop, design and implement:&#13;
a mission statement defining more clearly AQUA's corporate objectives;&#13;
a more effective organizational structure with definition of intra organizational relationships,&#13;
job profiles and descriptions, staff number and efficiency;&#13;
a program to enhance the skills and competencies and code of conduct for all levels of&#13;
management and staff to introduce a "corporate culture" with commercial outlook, efficiency&#13;
and customer service;&#13;
a public relations capability, including proactive public relations strategy and plan of action&#13;
to improve the public image of the company;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
* effective customer service, including a customer charter and customer service providing a&#13;
functional link to consumers;&#13;
* programs and processes to ensure internal communication among all members of the company&#13;
facilitating effective downward, upward and lateral flow of information;&#13;
* human resource development, including programs for recruitment and training, advancement,&#13;
remuneration;&#13;
* asset management: titling, registration, valuation, maps/plans, insurance;&#13;
* appropriate computer based management and administrative systems, including management&#13;
information and control, budgeting, cost accounting, commercial, purchasing and stocks,&#13;
implemented in accordance with an integrated computerization strategy;&#13;
* new tariff structure based on customer ability and willingness to pay ained at providing&#13;
sufficient revenue generation for AQUA, promotion of water conservation and closing the gap&#13;
between industrial and domestic tariffs;&#13;
*  administrative programs and processes to ensure sustainable implementadon of water and&#13;
wastewater system rehabilitation and operational improvement efforts developed&#13;
simultaneously;&#13;
* programs to strengthen consumption metering, including metering policy for large apartment&#13;
buildings;&#13;
* integrated planning capacity to ensure that investments are cost effective, priority, affordable&#13;
and fit into AQUA's business plan.&#13;
5.    The above list of tasks is indicative of the nature of the work expected. Inclusion of additional&#13;
tasks not listed may be needed. Also many of the tasks are interrelated and therefore have to be taclded&#13;
in a strategic and coordinated fashion.&#13;
Implnetto&#13;
6.    To ensure that proposed solutions to a certain task/issue are supported by AQUA and where&#13;
applicable by stakeholders-unicipality, Voivodship, consumers, industry, for example-and can be&#13;
implemented, the work should proceed in a phased manner as outlined below:&#13;
* wide discussions with AQUA management and staff and stakeholders concerned leading to&#13;
strategic proposals agreed to by all; agreements should be documented in a strategy paper;&#13;
*  based on the agreed strategic solution, development of a specific plan of action which defmes&#13;
in detail how the envisioned goal would be achieved, including an imnplementation schedule,&#13;
assignation of responsibilities, procurement of any needed equipment (cost estimates,&#13;
specifications, acquisition), technical assistance and training needs;&#13;
* inplementation of the task in accordance with the plan of action;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
certification of task completion, i.e. new systems or processes are fully internalized and&#13;
consulting assistance is no longer required.&#13;
7.    The phased structure of the consulting assignment has been designed to facilitate intensive&#13;
cooperation between the consultants, AQUA and stakeholders. Proceeding with a phased approach is&#13;
expected to avoid spending resources on initiatives that do not have full local ownership. This approach&#13;
should, however, be employed flexibly. It should not delay action on tasks where there is obvious&#13;
agreement on how to proceed.&#13;
8.    Consultants are expected to work closely with AQUA management and staff. Their role will be&#13;
one of providing know how, guidance and facilitation of the institutional development process. As much&#13;
as possible, the work should be done by AQUA staff.&#13;
9.    The Bank loan includes funds for acquiring equipment (computer software and hardware, for&#13;
example) which might be needed for the implementation of some tasks. This equipment will be acquired&#13;
by the consultant on behalf of AQUA in accordance with relevant Bank procurement guidelines as defined&#13;
in the loan agreement. Any equipment will stay with AQUA after the consultant has completed his&#13;
assignment.&#13;
10.   An essential element of the consultant's work is training of AQUA staff. While most of this&#13;
should be done on the job in direct daily contact with the consultants, the Bank loan includes funds for&#13;
specific training for key personnel outside of Poland. Defining training needs and arranging for training&#13;
opportunities will be a cooperative task between consultants and AQUA.&#13;
Time Frame&#13;
11.   The consulting assignment is to be completed within a period of two years after the mobilization&#13;
of the consultant.&#13;
B. ENGUNEFRG SRVCES FOR WATR AND&#13;
WASTEWATER SYSEM REHABLITATION AND OPERATIONAL IMPROVMENT&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The Water and Wastewater Company of Bielsko-Biala (AQUA), the agency responsible for&#13;
providing water and wastewater services in the city of Bieliko-Biala, Poland has contracted a loan from&#13;
the World Bank to undertake the expansion, rehabilitation and operational improvement of its water and&#13;
wastewater facilities. As part of this project AQUA wishes to engage consulting services for:&#13;
preparation and implementation of a comprehensive program for rehabilitating and improving&#13;
the efficiency of AQUA's water system; and&#13;
preparation and implementation of a comprehensive program for rehabilitating and improving&#13;
the efficiency of AQUA's wastewater system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
Water Supply Network Rehabilitaton and Effidency Inprovement Progm&#13;
Objective&#13;
2.    The objective of this part of the consulting assignment is to assist AQUA design and initiate a&#13;
cost-effective, priority and sustainable program to:&#13;
* reduce physical water loss from the pipe network;&#13;
* reduce incidence of pipe failure and "red" water contamination;&#13;
* improve the hydraulic efficiency of the pipe/storage/pumping system to obtain energy savings;&#13;
* introduce appropriate methods and standards for the future maintenance and operation of&#13;
AQUA's water system.&#13;
3.    The project provides a budget of about US$1.5 million for the 1996-2002 period. The program&#13;
may receive additional support from AQUA's own funding.&#13;
Methodology and Approach&#13;
4.    To reach the above goals requires investing in pipe rehabilitation or replacement, improving the&#13;
efficiency of pumping stations and providing adequate treated water storage. The issue is to define&#13;
through appropriate analysis a strategic plan which can guide investments such that they yield the highest&#13;
possible benefits. This requires the definition of a prioritized sequence of investment so as to make the&#13;
best use of the resources available. The approach adopted to arrive at these investments should follow&#13;
the sequence of steps outlined below.&#13;
Step 1:   Assessment of Existng Situation&#13;
5.    As a basis for any decision making, a good understanding of the present condition of the pipe&#13;
network and the hydraulic behavior of the pipe, pumping and storage system are essential. Therefore the&#13;
program should begin with:&#13;
an examination of the existing system mapping records system and a check for their&#13;
completeness and accuracy;&#13;
an in depth physical inspection of the pipe system to obtain reliable information on its state&#13;
of repair; to that effect the consultant should assist AQUA in carrying out a comprehensive&#13;
survey (physical inspections, analysis of breakage pipe failure records) of the present status&#13;
of the pipe network and documenting it;&#13;
a detailed leak assessment and identification (flow balance, metering, night flow analysis,&#13;
physical detection) to understand the extent, causes and main location of leakage; and&#13;
the preparation and calibration of a mathematical simulation model which can accurately&#13;
represent flows and pressures throughout the water system.&#13;
6.    In carrying out these assessments, a thorough analysis of the information already available to&#13;
AQUA should be made. Further field investigation, and analysis, collation and presentation of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
information would be carried out in accordance with a plan of action agreed to by AQUA. This plan of&#13;
action would spell out clearly the level of effort proposed in terms of number and location of field&#13;
inspections, equipment needs, costs involved and assignment of manpower from AQUA and the&#13;
consultant. Regarding the hydraulic modelling of the system, a mathematical model appropriate for the&#13;
characteristics should be used.&#13;
Step 2:   Elaboration of a Prioritized Strategic Plan&#13;
7.    Information gained during the first step is used to identify and analyze investment interventions&#13;
needed to reach the objectives of the program. This will involve a combination of a number of actions,&#13;
including pipe rehabilitation or replacement, closing of bottlenecks, replacement of existing pumps with&#13;
more energy efficient ones and adjusting storage arrangements. Special emphasis should be given to the&#13;
identification of win-win solutions: for example, the rehabilitation/replacement of old heavily corroded&#13;
and tuberculated pipe may reduce water contamination, leakage and friction losses. The result of these&#13;
analyses would be a plan of specific investment proposals ranked in accordance with a definition of&#13;
priorities. Any proposed investments should be justified by cost-benefit analysis to the extent practical&#13;
and ranked in relation to the highest rate of retum.&#13;
Step 3:   Preparation of Detailed Annual Inveshnent Plans&#13;
8.    Based on the prioritized strategic investment plans identified in Step 2, specific annual investment&#13;
plans should be developed within the budget available from the Bank loan and AQUA funds.&#13;
Step 4:   Implementation Assistance&#13;
9.    The consultant should assist AQUA in the implementation of the annual investment plans&#13;
developed under Step 3. This involves specifically the preparation of bidding packages for the acquisition&#13;
of materials and civil works and assistance in contracting.&#13;
Step 5:   Preparation of Maintenance and Operation Plan&#13;
10.   The consultant should provide assistance to AQUA in organizing plans and a capacity to assure&#13;
sustained maintenance and operation of the water supply system.&#13;
Wastewater Network Rehabilitation/Efficiency Improvement Program&#13;
Objecdve&#13;
11.   The objective of this part of the consulting assignment is to assist AQUA design and initiate a cost&#13;
effective, priority and sustainable program to:&#13;
reduce infiltration/inflow into the pipe network and thereby reduce the hydraulic load on&#13;
wastewater treatment plants;&#13;
improve the efficiency of flow through the pipe/pumping system to obtain energy savings;&#13;
reduce the incidence of combined sewer overflows;&#13;
better control industrial wastewater discharges.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
12.   The project provides a budget of about US$3.3 million for the 1996-2002 period. The program&#13;
may receive additional support from AQUA's own funding.&#13;
Approach&#13;
13.   Bielsko-Biala possesses a largely combined sewer system whose construction was begun in the&#13;
1800's. Replacing and rehabilitating its sewer system, and reducing infiltration and inflow are becoming&#13;
an ever more urgent necessity and AQUA will have to begin a systematic program of sewer renovation&#13;
and replacement. Although not of priority concern today, combined sewer overflows will have to be&#13;
reduced in the medium and long term future.&#13;
14.   The approach for the wastewater system improvement program would be similar to that adopted&#13;
for the dealing with the water network. Again, the issue is to define through appropriate analysis a&#13;
strategic plan which can guide investments such that they yield the highest possible benefits. This requires&#13;
the definition of a prioritized sequence of investment so as to make the best use of the resources available.&#13;
The approach adopted to arrive at these investments should follow the sequence of steps outlined below.&#13;
Step 1:   Assessment of Existing Situation&#13;
15.   As a basis for any decision making, a good understanding of the present condition of the pipe&#13;
network, pumping stations and composition of the wastewater are essential. Therefore the program should&#13;
begin with:&#13;
an in depth physical inspection of the pipe system to obtain reliable information on its state&#13;
of repair; to that effect the consultant should assist AQUA in carrying out a comprehensive&#13;
survey (physical inspections, CCTV, analysis of breakage pipe failure records) of the present&#13;
status of the pipe network and documenting it;&#13;
a detailed assessment and identification of main sources and magnitude of infiltration and&#13;
inflow, including water entering the sewer system as a result of water wastage by industrial&#13;
and domestic users;&#13;
a survey of all industrial polluters to obtain a better understanding of the industrial flow rates&#13;
and composition of their wastes, comparison of the commercial register with industrial&#13;
permits;&#13;
inventory and survey of combined sewer overflows, including magnitude and frequency of&#13;
overflows, water quality data and assessment of impact of combined sewer overflows on the&#13;
receiving water;&#13;
survey of the state of repair of wastewater pumping stations, including an energy audit; and&#13;
preparation and calibration of an appropriate mathematical simulation model (unsteady flow,&#13;
backwater and storage effects) for both dry weather and storm weather flow to better&#13;
understand the hydraulic performance of the sewer system.&#13;
16.   In carrying out these assessments, a thorough analysis of the information already available to&#13;
AQUA should be made. Further field investigation, and analysis, collation and presentation of&#13;
information would be carried out in accordance with a plan of action agreed to AQUA. This plan of&#13;
action would spell out clearly the level of effort proposed in terms of number and location of field&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
inspections, equipment needs, costs involved and assignment of manpower from AQUA and the&#13;
consultant.&#13;
Step 2:   Elaboration of a Prioritized Strategic Plan&#13;
17.   Information gained during the first step and the sewer simulation model are used to identify and&#13;
analyze investment interventions needed to reach the objectives of the program. This will involve a&#13;
combination of a number of actions, including pipe rehabilitation or replacement, measures to reduce&#13;
infiltration and inflow, replacement of existing pumps with more energy efficient ones, better opeating&#13;
procedures to reduce combined sewer overflows. Again special emphasis should be given to the&#13;
identification of win-win solutions: for example, the rehabilitation/replacement of old pipes may reduce&#13;
the need for repairs and would reduce infiltration. The result of these analyses would be a plan of&#13;
specific investment proposals, ranked in accordance with a definition of priorities. Any proposed&#13;
investments should be justified by cost-benefit analysis to the extent practical and ranked in relalion to the&#13;
highest rate of return.&#13;
Step 3:   Preparation of Detailed Annual Investment Plans&#13;
18.   Based on the prioritized strategic investment plans identified in Step 2, specific annual investment&#13;
plans should be developed within the budget available from the Bank loan and AQUA funds.&#13;
Step 4:   Implementation Assistance&#13;
19.   The consultants should assist AQUA in the implementation of the annual investment plans&#13;
developed under Step 3. This involves specifically the preparation of bidding packages for the acquisition&#13;
of materials and civil works and assistance in contracting.&#13;
Step 5:   Preparation of Maintenance and Operation Plan&#13;
20.   The consultant should provide assistance to AQUA in organizing plans and a capacity to assure&#13;
sustained maintenance and operation of the water supply system.&#13;
Role of Consultants&#13;
21.    The main role of the consultants will be to provide organization, know how, guidance and&#13;
general facilitation of the work. As much as possible, the work should be done by AQUA staff thereby&#13;
providing on the job training.&#13;
22.   The Bank loan includes funds for acquiring equipment and civil works needed to initiate&#13;
investments. Also funds are provided for equipment (TV equipment, flow meters, leak detection,&#13;
computer software and hardware, for example) which might be needed for the implementation of some&#13;
tasks. This equipment will be acquired by the consultant on behalf of AQUA in accordance with relevant&#13;
Bank procurement guidelines as defined in the loan agreement. Any equipment will stay with AQUA&#13;
after the consultant has completed his assignment.&#13;
23.   An most essential element of the consultant's work is training AQUA's staff. While most of this&#13;
should be done on the job in direct daily contact with the consultants, the Bank loan includes funds for&#13;
specific training for key personnel outside of Poland. Defining training needs and arranging for training&#13;
opportunities will be a cooperative task between the consultant and AQUA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
Time Frame&#13;
24.   The consulting assignment is to be completed within a period of three years after the mobilization&#13;
of the consultant.&#13;

ANNEX E&#13;
POLISH NATIONAL FUND FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION&#13;
AND WATER MANAGEMENT&#13;
Background and Objectives&#13;
1.    The National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management (NFEP) is an&#13;
independent state institution with the mission of financing environmental protection projects. The National&#13;
Fund collects money from charges for the economic use of the environment as well as penalties for non-&#13;
compliance with environmental protection regulations.&#13;
2.    The National Fund was established through an amalgamation of two previously separate&#13;
institutions-the Environmental Protection Fund and the Water Management Fund and commenced&#13;
activities July 1989. The National Fund was later accompanied by the establishment of local and&#13;
provincial funds for environmental protection and water management. These local and provincial funds,&#13;
like the National Fund, receive revenues from various pollution charges and natural resource use fees.&#13;
In general, 10 percent of the charges go to the local funds, with 60 percent of the remaining money to&#13;
the provincial funds and 30 percent to the National Fund. The environmental funds all collect and&#13;
disburse money for projects involving environmental protection.&#13;
3.    Poland's environmental protection related expenditures rose from US$437 million in 1990 to&#13;
US$889 million in 1993. Total annual environmental expenditures and NFEP's share of those&#13;
expenditures are shown in Table El. Table E2 shows the sources used to fund environmental&#13;
expenditures in 1993.&#13;

Total                $889.0      100%&#13;
Source of Revenue&#13;
4.    Revenues of the National Fund have systematically increased. During 1990-1993 revenues rose&#13;
from US$12.9 million to US$284.0 million. The National Fund's revenue comes primarily from air&#13;
emission charges, wastewater charges, water use charges, waste disposal charges and various fees for non-&#13;
compliance with environmental protection regulations.&#13;
Disbueent Mechanims&#13;
5.    The National Fund provides its financial assistance in the form of:&#13;
soft loans&#13;
grants and subsidies&#13;
interest subsidies to loans originated by the Environmental Protection Bank and&#13;
partial forgiveness of loan repayment&#13;
and recently has initiated guarantees against loans extended for environmental protection projects.&#13;
6.    Soft loans are the dominant form of financing extended by the National Fund and may be used&#13;
to cover 50 percent of a project's cost. Award of a loan is conditional upon presentation of full financial&#13;
coverage (inclusive of financing from NFEP) of the investment project. The National Fund also requires&#13;
submission of an economic analysis of the project based on its business plan and financial projections.&#13;
For projects where the amount requested for financing by the National Fund exceeds about US$225,000,&#13;
project suppliers and contractors must be selected through competitive tendering.&#13;
7.    Interest subsidies against loans originated by the Environmental Protection Bank are provided on&#13;
the same terms as the soft loans offered by the National Fund-equivalent to the difference between the&#13;
conmercial interest rate applied by the Environmental Protection Bank and the preferential rate applied&#13;
by the National Fund.&#13;
8.    Loan forgiveness is provided to investors who fulfill their contractual commitments vis a vis the&#13;
National Fund and meet particular criteria. Not more that 50 percent of loan principal may be written&#13;
off in this manner. Loan forgiveness is awarded to borrowers who meet National Fund requirements in&#13;
terms of environmental benefits and loan repayment. Forgiveness decisions are issued with a clause&#13;
requiring the beneficiary to apply the funds thus saved towards fuirther environmental protection.&#13;

to 250 incidents in 1996, 200 incidents in 1997, 150 incidents in 1998, 100 incidents in&#13;
1999, 50 incidents in 2000.&#13;
Demand Management&#13;
§ 8. AQUA commits itself to continue the use of individual household water meters in all new&#13;
buildings, individual metering of all industrial and large commercial consumers, gradual introduction of&#13;
individual household meters where compatible with existing building structures,. meter testing and&#13;
replacement programs, education and/or supervision of plumbing contractors, advice to industrial users&#13;
on opportunities for water-saving process changes or water recycling, etc. in order to encourage resource&#13;
conservation and bring down average water use to an efficient level in line with European comparators.&#13;
Specific targets are:&#13;
(i)   100 % of large-customer (1000 m3/mth) meters tested every 4 years according to Polish&#13;
standards;&#13;
(ii)   8 % of domestic meters changed per year;&#13;
(iii)  10 % of domestic meters tested per year.&#13;
Internal Efflciency and Productivity Improvemnts&#13;
§ 9. AQUA will undertake comprehensive programs to raise the efficiency and productivity of its&#13;
operations, in order to alleviate the upward trend of costs and service prices. Specifics of this program&#13;
are to be defined, with the assistance of consultants to be engaged under the World Bank funded project,&#13;
following studies to be completed by December 31, 1997. The following targets are prelimninary and will&#13;
be updated as a result of the studies:&#13;
(i)   reduction of annual ratio of non-revenue water (water produced minus water billed, divided&#13;
by water produced), from the current 45 % level to 35 % in 2000;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
(ii)  reduction of energy consumption for water production and distribution from a present 0.65&#13;
KWh used per m3 of water produced to 0.64 KWh in 1997, 0.63 KWh in 1998 and 0.60&#13;
KWh in 2000;&#13;
(iii)  reduction of energy consumption of wastewater collection and treatment from a present 0.15&#13;
KWh used per m3 of wastewater collected and treated to 0.14 KWh in 1997, 0.14 KWh in&#13;
1998 and 0.12 KWh in 2000.&#13;
§ 10. AQUA will continue to improve the productivity of its staff through training programs and&#13;
performance incentives accompanied by programs of staff efficiency gains which will reduce the number&#13;
of employees per thousand population served divided by the length in kilometers of the water and&#13;
wastewater network served by one employee from a present 0.97 to 0.87 in 2000.&#13;
§ 11. AQUA will continue to manage its construction department in a self financing manner, i.e.,&#13;
charging prices at or below prevailing construction costs in the regional market. If the construction can&#13;
no longer match price levels offered by private contractors, the department may find it necessary to reduce&#13;
the size of or, if necessary dissolve the department.&#13;
Finandal Performance&#13;
§ 12. To maintain its financial viability and be able to carry the envisioned investments, AQUA&#13;
commits itself to maintaining a satisfactory financial position at all times. Attachments 1 (Balance Sheet)&#13;
and 2 (Income Statement) present financial projections for the 1996-2000 period which would allow that.&#13;
The table shown below presents annual financial performance indicators which AQUA must attain to&#13;
maintain a satisfactory financial position. AQUA commits itself to ensuring the maintenance of these&#13;
indicators through a combination of revenue increases and expenditure decreases. Annually, AQUA will&#13;
update financial projections with a special view if any tariff or other adjustments are necessary to maintain&#13;
compliance with the financial indicators listed below (define according to the 'Handbook for Financial&#13;
Projections and Analysis for Corporation Utilities in Water Supply" - UNDP/World Bank, RAS/86/160,&#13;
December 1992):&#13;

Tariff Settng and Collection&#13;
§ 13. To be able to achieve the financial performance indicators shown above AQUA will need&#13;
increased tariff income which in turn will require tariff increases in real terms. AQUA and the&#13;
municipality of Bielsko-Biala agree to annual tariff increases for the core services connected with water&#13;
supply and wastewater collection in the area of the Municipality in accordance with the following indexing&#13;
formula which distinguishes between increases in real terms and those necessitated by inflationary cost&#13;
increases:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
k = T4X [0.4w  +0.2Et+O.4C' ]x(1+k,)U&#13;
where:&#13;
T,, is the tariff for a cubic meter of water or wastewater/rainwater or a monthly rate for&#13;
maintenance of a water meter as of January 1 of year t for customer category/water-meter&#13;
type i; and Ti,O the tariff as of 1 February 1995 for the same customer category/water-meter&#13;
type, where in case of cancelling separate payments for entering of rainwater into the sewer&#13;
system, Ti,, is a tariff for wastewater as on 1 February 1995 increased by an amount equal&#13;
to a quotient of income from payments for getting rainwater into the sewer system planned&#13;
in 1995 and the volume of wastewater planned for entering the sewer system in 1995 (in&#13;
cubic meters);&#13;
W, and W. are the latest published indexes of average wages and their forecasts in a sector&#13;
of companies, respectively on 1 January of year t and 1 February 1995 (on the basis of an&#13;
announcement of the President of the Main Office of Statistics as published in "Monitor&#13;
Polski" regarding average monthly wages in the sector of companies and forecasted as an&#13;
average from the last three months);&#13;
Et, E.; C,/C.; similarly defined indexes representative of applicable energy costs and index&#13;
of construction prices (acc. to Biuletyn Statystyczny/Statistical Bulletin of the Main Office&#13;
of Statistics monthly indexes of growth of the following, respectively: "prices of sold&#13;
output in the sphere of energy, gas, steam and hot water supply' and also 'prices of&#13;
construction and assembly production" which are forecasted as an average from the last&#13;
three months);&#13;
for each category of customer/water-meter type i, k;1 is a real-term adjustment factor and&#13;
reflects (a) the need to gradually raise tariffs in real terms to meet the incremental cost of&#13;
new quality/environmental requirements, net of the effect of expected efficiency gains; (b)&#13;
the need to rebalance the tariff structure in order to reduce existing cross-subsidization&#13;
between classes of users over given time5&#13;
n = t - is the subsequent year number after 1995 (from 1 to 5)&#13;
./  The fnancial projections postulate that the following K factors need to be applied to ensure AQUA's satisfactory financial&#13;
performance and gradually reduce the gap between domestic and industrial tariffs:&#13;

§ 14. The tariffs for water and wastewater/rainwater and water meters will be adjusted once a&#13;
year in time for the January billings in accordance with the above formula. AQUA's Management Board&#13;
shall have full authority to make these adjustments as long as required tariff adjustments do not exceed&#13;
the level resulting from formula specified in § 13. Only when AQUA considers necessary price increases&#13;
exceeding the level provided by the formula, as mentioned in § 2, § 3 of the Agreement mentioned in §&#13;
2 is applicable.&#13;
§ 15. The Municipality confinns its full support for effective collection of tariffs by AQUA. In&#13;
particular, it will uphold AQUa's right to discontinue service after appropriate notice in accordance with&#13;
the Civil Code provisions for delinquent customers. In the event that for social reasons the Municipality&#13;
requests that AQUA continue service delivery for a customer or group of customers in arrears, the&#13;
Municipality will reimburse AQUA for the sums due by these customers before the normal date of the&#13;
service cut.&#13;
§ 16. Likewise, any request by the Municipality to AQUA to provide free or discounted services&#13;
to any persons, associations or enterprises for social or other reasons will be acted upon by AQUA only&#13;
after it receives from the Municipality full financial compensation for the lost revenues arising from this&#13;
request.&#13;
§ 17. In order to enable AQUA to meet its service and financial targets, the Municipality of&#13;
Bielsko-Biala agrees that for the period of this Agreement AQUA shall not pay dividends to shareholders,&#13;
but retain its eamnings for reinvestment in its core water and wastewater business and the structure if this&#13;
reinvestment will be agreed by AQUA and the Municipality of Bielsko-Biala.&#13;

NET PRESENT VALUE&#13;
1.    Revenues and costs with and without the project calculated over an assumed 30 year life yield a&#13;
US$31.5 million net present value at a ten percent discount rate (equivalent to a 23 percent internal rate&#13;
of return). Revenue and cost streams are calculated with the following assumptions, and shown on the&#13;
subsequent page.&#13;
Revenue&#13;
2.    "with project" is total operating revenue as projected in the financial model for 1996-2005 in 1996&#13;
prices, and constant thereafter.&#13;
3.    "without project" is 1996 total operating revenue, held constant throughout the period.&#13;
Capital cost&#13;
4.    "with project" is total capital expenditure as projected in the financial model for 1996-2005 less&#13;
the portion due to taxes, both in 1996 prices, and constant thereafter.&#13;
5.    "without project" is non-project capital expenditure as projected in the financial model for 1996-&#13;
2005 in 1996 prices, and constant thereafter.&#13;
Operating and maintenance cost&#13;
6.    "with project" is total operating expense, as projected in the financial model for 1996-2005 in&#13;
1996 prices, and constant thereafter.&#13;
7.    "without project" is 1996 total operating expense projected to increase at one percent annually&#13;
