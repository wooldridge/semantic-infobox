        <abstracts>
            Sydney Water, a statutory corporation
            responsible for capturing, storing, treating, and
            reticulating Sydney's water, has contracted for
            privately built, owned, and operated (BOO) treatment plants.
            By the end of the century, these plants will treat almost
            all the drinking water consumed in Sydney. The authors
            review the BOO bidding process, the risk-sharing
            arrangements between Sydney Water and the treatment
            companies, and the new regulatory process for setting water prices.
