Firm-Level Surveys to Aid Private Sector&#13;
Development Strategies&#13;
Andrew Stone&#13;
Firm-level surveys are a systematic way  ence and priorities of entrepreneurs&#13;
of including the views and experiences  and managers.' For example, while&#13;
of individual private firms in the design   entrepreneurs may not be in a position&#13;
of policy programs to remove con-  to judge the optimal level of invest-&#13;

Ranking costs &#13;
Surveys help evaluate the burden imposed on busi-&#13;
nesses by such constraints as excessive regulation&#13;
and inadequate public infrastructure. One important   attention to discontinuities in costs imposed by the&#13;
method the survey can apply is to focus on relative    enabling environment or support systems. This type&#13;

observed) incremental costs associated with the con-   constrain entry, and threshold costs encountered by&#13;
straints. For example, firms are often asked to rank    firms growing beyond a certain size. In Mexico,&#13;

            Firm-level surveys are a systematic way
            of including the views and experiences of individual private
            firms in the design of policy programs to remove constraints
            to private sector growth.  The surveys often are a part of
            the World Bank Group's Private Sector Assessment--a
            wide-ranging study of the role of the private sector in an
            economy, the constraints to private sector development, and
            the implications of both for the country and for the Bank
            Group's work.  Some surveys have not been able to
            correctly identify costs, ensure systematic implementation,
            and manage the risk of survey errors.  This Note outlines
            various approaches to address these problems.  It also uses
            previous lessons learned to alert survey designers of survey risks.
