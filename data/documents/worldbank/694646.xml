STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1.  ISSUES IN THIE EDUCATION SECTOR&#13;
A.    PUBLIC SECTOR RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ISSUES&#13;
1.1    Overall educational effort. The share of the overall government budget devoted to education&#13;
(14-15 percent) remains reasonable compared to other countries in the region and to OECD countries.&#13;
However, education spending as a share of GDP hias fallen from nearly 8 percent in 1991 to below 6&#13;
percent in 1997; this has coincided with a period of sharp GDP decline. The result has been a sharp&#13;
decline in both nominal and real budget allocations for education. Per student spending per annum at the&#13;
primary level has declined steadily in real terms (constant 1992 prices) from just under $400 in 1991 to&#13;
about $230 in 1997. The education sector has coped with this serious reduction in funding through a&#13;
salary freeze at nominal 1994 levels and by reducing its budgets for everything but salaries (over 80&#13;
percent of budgeted funds) and utilities, such as rising heating and utility costs. To make matters worse,&#13;
lower than expected revenues have caused actual expenditures to be 10- 15 percent less than what is&#13;
budgeted. Because salaries are paid in full, capital investments, discretionary non-salary spending on&#13;
educational inputs, and maintenance of facilities go largely unfunded. As would be expected in this&#13;
situation, physical infrastructure -- old to begin with -- is deteriorating rapidly and the quality of&#13;
education is at serious risk of decline. Given the importance of human resource development in&#13;
stimulating a successful long term economic transition, the current share of GDP devoted to education&#13;
should be protected, at a minimum, and should probably increase. Steps should also be, in conjunction&#13;
with reducing staff numbers in the sector, to give non-salary educational expenditure priority when&#13;
revenue shortfalls occur.&#13;
1.2    Needfor budget re-allocations. The formter Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's share of&#13;
personnel expenditure in its public education budget (80 percent) is by far the highest in the region, and&#13;
its budget allocation for capital expenditure (3 percent) is by far the lowest in the region, and only about&#13;
half this amount is actually spent. Per student spending for capital renewal is below $6 per annum.&#13;
Increasing spending for capital expenditure can best be accomplished through international aid, and is&#13;
thus the major investment focus of this project. Increasing education spending on non-salary inputs&#13;
within the current budgetary constraints can only be carried out through a combination of reducing&#13;
teaching staff (see below) and shifting these resources to non-salary inputs such as teacher in-service&#13;
training, educational materials and other expenditures which allow teaching and technical staff to do&#13;
their jobs better. Given the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's economic status, spending on&#13;
student welfare (about 7 percent of the budget) cannot be expected to decline significantly in the medium&#13;
term; instead the focus should be put on better targeting these resources, particularly in higher education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2 -&#13;
1.3    Controlling spending on personnel. In view of budget constraints, the Ministry of Education and&#13;
Physical Culture (MOE) has no choice but to reduce the number of personnel working in the sector. The&#13;
development of a plan to reduce teaching and non-teaching staff has been made a central focus of SSAC&#13;
conditionality. This process is complicated by the well-justified constitutional obligation to provide&#13;
education in multiple languages (Macedonian, Albanian, Serbian, Turkish, Romany and Vlachs), which&#13;
necessarily results in inefficient student/teacher ratios given small groupings of various language groups.&#13;
Pupil:teacher ratios are currently about 19:1 in primary and 16:1 in secondary, well below OECD&#13;
averages. Due to political necessity, the MOE is expected to deal with the need for reducing teacher&#13;
numbers through attrition followed by selective replacement. Thus, efforts to reduce the teaching force&#13;
will likely not reflect a perfectly rational mix of needed teaching skills. Staff reductions for primary&#13;
education are expected to be on the order of about 2 percent per year for at least the next three years.&#13;
Reducing the numbers of highily specialized vocational teachers through means other than attrition --&#13;
mainly lay-offs and re-training -- may have to be addressed in the context of an overall restructuring of&#13;
that sector.&#13;
B.    LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL ISSUES&#13;
1.4    Several key pieces of legislation -- including the laws on pre-school, social care of children, and&#13;
higher education -- are not yet in place, leaving important issues unresolved. Among them are (a) the&#13;
control of the pre-school budget, and the separation between social and educational services to pre-&#13;
school children; and (b) the "degree" structure within secondary and higher education, which is still&#13;
governed by the structure set out in a 1985 law of the former Yugoslavia.&#13;
1.5    Other issues, not currently under active legal consideration but of concern in educational circles,&#13;
are the possible extension of compulsory education from 8 to 9 years, with the entrance age lowered&#13;
from 7 to 6; the implementation of the Matura examination at the end of full secondary; the status of&#13;
external qualifications, such as the International Baccalaureate (IB), in university admissions; and the&#13;
implementation of a teacher appraisal system and its implications for the respective roles of inspectors&#13;
and advisers.&#13;
1.6   Institutionally, the most pressing issues are: (a) the need for more effective communications&#13;
between the MOE and its Pedagogical Institute (PIM), partly due to the geographical distance between&#13;
the Ministry and the unsatisfactory housing for PIM which is located in temporary barracks far removed&#13;
from the MOE; (b) the fact that the PIM Directorship has been vacant for two years; (c) the large and&#13;
ever-increasing workload of the PIM due to recent changes in legislation that give it responsibility for&#13;
curriculum development, textbook approval, in-service teacher training, inspections and evaluating&#13;
student performance; (d) the internal structure of the PIM, which is organized by sector (pre-school and&#13;
Grades 1-4, subject teaching Grades 5-8, secondary, vocational) rather than functions (curriculum,&#13;
assessment, teacher training), leading to duplication of effort and inefficient use of expertise within the&#13;
PIM; (e) the lack of a focus for the coherent implementation of education reforms, either in the MOE&#13;
(there is, for example, no Planning Department in the MOE yet, although one is being proposed) or in the&#13;
PIM (there is, for example, no cadre of testing/assessment specialists, and examinations are prepared by&#13;
various people in each section).&#13;
1.7    With respect to quality assurance, the MOE-based Inspectorate mainly focuses on the&#13;
organization and administration of schools, while the PIM concerns itself with matters of content and&#13;
delivery. There is little contact between inspectors and advisers, and little mutual understanding and&#13;
trust. For example, now that the law requires that all teachers must be appraised every two years, no&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
thought has yet been given as to how the two agencies might work together to design a quality&#13;
monitoring system for schools with clearly specified, complementary roles for inspection and advice, and&#13;
clearly specified ways in which a struggling or failing teacher might be helped rather than penalized. A&#13;
second, but related, issue is that of adequate coverage for the country. With 30 Inspectors and&#13;
approximately 150 PIM advisers the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia appears to be reasonably&#13;
well provided for, but in practice school visits are irregular and follow-up is haphazard, partly because of&#13;
the lack of communication between the Inspectorate and the PIM but also because of (a) inadequate&#13;
travel funds; (b) lack of experienced advisers in some subjects or minority languages; and (c) lack of&#13;
well-defined roles and co-ordinated plans.&#13;
C.    EQuITY AND ACCESS-RELATED ISSUES&#13;
1 .8    Traditionally, countries in the region have been able to reach near-universal access to basic&#13;
education, with enrollment ratios in the upper 90s. However, the poorer countries now find it difficult to&#13;
maintain access to basic education, with a marked decline in countries such as the former Yugoslav&#13;
Republic of Macedonia (93.2% in 1990 to 87.2% in 1994), Albania (100.6% in 1990 to 95.3% in 1994),&#13;
Bulgaria (97.8% in 1990 to 91.9% in 1994), and Romania (98.3% in 1990 to 94.6% in 1994). At the&#13;
same time, the more affluent countries in the region have been able to maintain their enrollment rates&#13;
(the Czech Republic, Hungary). In secondary education, access is also deteriorating in the less affluent&#13;
countries, with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's gross enrollment rates declining from&#13;
56.8% in 1990 to 52.3% in 1994. Access to higher education has traditionally been more restricted in the&#13;
region, but is now rising rapidly in such countries as Hungary, Romania, Poland and Slovenia; in the&#13;
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, it has remained stable at about 12-14% of the age group since&#13;
1990.1&#13;
1.9    Provision. The Ministry and the PIM  make strong, positive, and commendable efforts to ensure&#13;
that all children in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, regardless of gender, color, national,&#13;
ethnic or social origin, political or religious beliefs, property, and social status have equal access to, and&#13;
opportunities in, education. Inevitably, however, there are differences of provision in rural and urban&#13;
areas, and participation rates of some ethnic minorities (especially Roma) are less than those of others.&#13;
There are certain inefficiencies in providing every curriculum, textbook, test, etc. in as many as four or&#13;
even five languages, but in order to protect children's rights and to address minority inequities, these&#13;
must be accommodated.&#13;
1.10   Sector inequities. Judging from the allocation of funds to the various levels within the system,&#13;
there is some evidence that higher education and pre-school education are relatively over-funded&#13;
compared to the compulsory (basic, 8-year) level. Pre-school in particular is heavily subsidized by the&#13;
state. Since pre-school (and higher education) are non-compulsory and accessible almost exclusively to&#13;
urban and more well-off families, there is a case to be made for re-allocating funding to the compulsory&#13;
sector which is often the only schooling available to rural and poor children.&#13;
1.11   Gender. There appears to be no significant difference in the overall participation rates for girls&#13;
and boys, although at secondary level (especially in vocational education) there are more boys than girls,&#13;
"Social Challenges of Transition: Education Sector". The World Bank, Human Resources Sector Operations&#13;
Division, Central and Southem Europe Departments, Europe and Central Asia Region. Washington, November&#13;
1995, p. 18. These are gross enrollment rates based on the World Bank's own demographic data which may&#13;
differ from those available in the countries themselves.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
and there is a clear segregation between subjects that are traditionally "male" (mechanics, mining,&#13;
carpentry) and those that are traditionally "female" (medical subjects, hairdressing, secretarial, catering).&#13;
1.12   Urban-rural. At the time of independence in 1993, there was a significant "urban drift" from&#13;
rural areas into towns, often by families in search of work or better living conditions. During that period,&#13;
the MOE closed a number of rural schools, especially those that were in poor condition or in areas where&#13;
de-population was severe. Recently, families have begun to move back to the villages, putting pressure&#13;
on the MOE to rehabilitate and re-open sclhools. Due to lack of resources and the almost complete&#13;
absence of any capital investment budget for the MOE, about half of all rural schools are dilapidated,&#13;
overcrowded and insufficiently furnished and heated. Such conditions are not conducive to improving&#13;
equity between rural and urban communities, poor and more affluent children, and among nationalities.&#13;
A further source of inequity is the lack, in some cases, of qualified teachers in some subjects or&#13;
languages of instruction, but the MOE is making every effort to address this problem.&#13;
1.13   Family income. Several factors, especially the dramatic rise in unemployment (about 28%&#13;
overall of the population between 18-57), lay-offs, arrears in payment of salaries, and a rise in living&#13;
costs have increased the proportion of the population that lives at or below the poverty line. At the same&#13;
time, the costs of schooling have gone up; parents pay for textbooks (at Grade 1, this can be as high as&#13;
$50 per child; a set of Co-Ordinated Science textbooks for upper elementary (Oxford University Press,&#13;
published in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia by Prosvetno Delo) costs about $17.50).&#13;
Parents also pay for food (this can be as high as $30/per month) and for incidental expenses such as&#13;
exercise books, supplementary readers, art materials etc. The average monthly wage in the former&#13;
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is about US$ 175 equivalent.&#13;
D.    CURRICULUM-RELATED ISSUES&#13;
1.14. Current status. At independence in 1993, a "standing committee" was established to draft&#13;
proposals for curriculum reform. Little real progress has been made until recently. "Concept"&#13;
documents have now been prepared -- one for elementary education and one for secondary education --as&#13;
well as a well-intentioned, but insufficient re-grouping of vocational subjects. All three of these&#13;
documents were accepted by the Minister of Education in October 1996. Currently, however, 25 subject&#13;
working groups have been set up under the PIM, each with a co-ordinator, to produce one new curricula.&#13;
1.15   Proposals have been made to reduce the prescribed, common core of the curriculum to 70%, with&#13;
30% available for schools and teachers to use more flexibly. Experience with this type of arrangement in&#13;
other countries in the region, however, shows that teachers find it difficult to determine which "30% " of&#13;
the curriculum is open to local variation; some interpret it to mean "30% of the timetable" while others&#13;
try to introduce up to 30% "local content" into some, but not all, curricula. Through lack of training in&#13;
local curriculum development, and lack of good supporting materials, most teachers simply continue to&#13;
teach 100% of the prescribed curriculum. Effective use of curriculum flexibility will require training and&#13;
resources. In addition, there is an obvious need to phase and co-ordinate the introduction of new&#13;
curricula so that they will benefit the majority of pupils during their school careers, and to synchronize&#13;
this with the introduction of new-style assessment types, teaching methods, and textbooks.&#13;
1.16   With regard to the elementary curriculum, the PIM staff state that they attempted, but did not&#13;
succeed in including two innovations: (1) differentiation of the curriculum "by level of ability and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5 -&#13;
interest"2, and (2) a change in elementary education from 8 to 9 years, with pupils starting at age 6 rather&#13;
than age 7. Clearly, these issues have important pedagogical and financial implications and would need&#13;
thorough debate before they are considered again.&#13;
1.17   At secondary level, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia shows the same -- although&#13;
much more moderate -- shift of pupils away from vocational and into general education as other&#13;
countries in the region (general education showed an increase from 22.9% in 1992 to 28.8% in 1995).&#13;
This means that general secondary programs (gininazia) will increasingly need to cater to pupils of a&#13;
wide range of academic ability. Curricula will need to be adapted accordingly.&#13;
1.18   Curriculum reform is particularly urgent iin secondary professional (vocational) education, which&#13;
despite recent efforts is still far too specialized. The newly re-grouped system of 15 clusters and 111&#13;
separate "occupations" does not represent a significant reform of content or orientation and should be&#13;
fundamentally reviewed on the basis of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's economic needs.&#13;
In preparing the latest revision (October 1996), no research was done to determine whether these 111&#13;
occupations actually reflect what the labor market demands and can absorb; in any case, it appears&#13;
unnecessary to have 4-year programs for the training of "pyrotecnists", or to make fine distinctions&#13;
between "locksmith-welders", "mechanical locksmiths", and "metalsmiths" (each a 3-year course), or to&#13;
offer a course for "green surfaces arrangers" (2 years, in the "forestry" cluster). A shift to broader,&#13;
competency-based (rather than occupational) curricula is needed.&#13;
1.19   The development of an overall strategy to provide a better balance between general and&#13;
vocational/technical education is of prime importance, especially since (a) the majority of secondary&#13;
school pupils are still enrolled in vocational programs; (b) the majority of graduates become unemployed&#13;
or fail to find employment in the occupation for which they were trained; and (c) highly specialized&#13;
vocational secondary education is expensive, in terms of low student/teacher ratios and training&#13;
equipment, as well as externally inefficient in tenns of the flexible skills demanded by the rapidly&#13;
changing labor market.&#13;
E.     ASSESSMENT-RELATED ISSUES&#13;
1.20   Current status. There is at present no mechanism to permit the MOE to monitor standards in&#13;
learner achievement across schools or over time, and no systematic data on the quality of the former&#13;
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's education is collected or analyzed for feedback into MOE policy&#13;
formulation. Assessment in schools is continuous and tests are teacher-made. Only the grading system&#13;
is laid down by law (5-1 with 5=highest, and l=fail). Marks are aggregated by subject, and promotion to&#13;
the next grade is determined by the number of passing grades at the end of the year. In general,&#13;
repetition and drop-out rates are low in compulsory schools, and if they are high (as they were in upper&#13;
secondary), measures are taken to help failing pupils and to ensure that they leave school with some&#13;
qualification. There is no external test between (Grade 4 and Grade 5 (the transition from class-teaching&#13;
to subject-teaching). Written tests at the end of Grade 8 are set by the PIM (Macedonian language and&#13;
literature, and Mathematics). The 1995 Law on Secondary Education requires the introduction, by 2002,&#13;
of an external secondary school-leaving examination ("Matura") in five subjects. The following further&#13;
issues have been identified:&#13;
2   This means "streaming" or "tracking" pupils within classes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -&#13;
* The MOE does not, at present, earmark any funds for evaluation or assessment of learner&#13;
achievement. With an annual education budget of $223 million, this reflects a worrying lack of&#13;
commitment to quality assurance in the education system of the former Yugoslav Republic of&#13;
Macedonia. In a diversifying system, where the emphasis should shift away from rigid control of&#13;
inputs (curricula, textbooks, teaching methods), there will be an increasing need for monitoring the&#13;
quality of "output": what learners actually learn and achieve as a result of their schooling. There is,&#13;
however, no identifiable unit, or a cadre of trained experts, for assessment either in the MOE or in&#13;
the PIM. No staff member has specialist training in educational measurement.&#13;
*  Assessment instruments are of low technical quality: they lack validity, reliability, and comparability&#13;
in terms of difficulty levels and over time. Few resources or examples of good practice are available.&#13;
*  Teacher-made tests, test questions at the end of textbook sections, and PIM-set Grade-8 tests are&#13;
heavily knowledge- and content-based, and ask for "factography" rather than application or higher-&#13;
level skills such as problem solving or critical thinking. As long as the test requires the recall of&#13;
facts, that is what teachers will continue to teach and pupils will continue to learn, regardless of any&#13;
new curricula or teaching methods. Such tests have therefore a "negative backwash" effect on&#13;
teaching and learning, and must be changed.&#13;
*  There is no attempt to equate the marks given by individual teachers: no guidance is given as to what&#13;
level of performance a "5" or a "3" represents, and therefore the same level of achievement can&#13;
receive quite different marks from different teachers, and different schools also apply different&#13;
"standards" so that no conclusions about learner achievement can be drawn either across schools or&#13;
over time.&#13;
*  There is an awareness both within the MOE and the PIM of the need to formulate "national&#13;
standards", on the basis of which curricula and assessment instruments can be designed. However,&#13;
there is no agreement as to what such "national standards" should look like, who should establish&#13;
them, or how they could be made to link with European or international "standards".&#13;
*  The new legal requirement for the introduction of a "Matura" examination at the end of full (4-year)&#13;
secondary education will be a useful focus for the development of such standards, and for the&#13;
improvement of assessment-related expertise in the PIM and among teachers.&#13;
*  As competition for university places increases, there will be pressure on faculties to select students&#13;
on more rigorous and "objective" criteria; thus the need for a more comprehensive and more&#13;
professional system of assessment will grow. The PIM is well aware of this, and also acknowledges&#13;
that there is a lack of expertise in modem assessment theory and practice; moreover, the PIM is&#13;
aware that, ideally, the development of assessment objectives and models should be done in parallel&#13;
with (and not after) the development of new curricula.&#13;
F.     TEXTBOOK-RELATED ISSUES&#13;
1.21   The main issues here are competition, fairness, quality, and price. There is wide support for&#13;
liberalizing textbook provision in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and for ensuring that the&#13;
new status of the state publisher, Prosvetno Delo, as a "social enterprise" is, in fact, no longer that of a&#13;
state monopoly. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is fortunate in that (a) it already possesses&#13;
a relatively flourishing private (general) publishing sector; (b) parents are becoming gradually used to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7 -&#13;
paying for textbooks, and have shown themselves willing to buy high-quality supplementary materials if&#13;
they are available at a reasonable price; and (c) some of the general book publishers have their own&#13;
bookshops and marketing/distribution networks through which they could reach most schools in the&#13;
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The stage seems set for a fairly rapid and successful opening-&#13;
up of the school textbook market.&#13;
1.22   At present, however, this market is not attractive to publishers, primarily because of the stringent&#13;
legal requirements to produce textbooks not only in Macedonian but in all minority languages. While this&#13;
is in itself commendable and clearly in accordance with the Constitution and the law, there is a danger&#13;
that smaller, private publishers would not be interested in producing (or finanicially unable to produce)&#13;
unprofitable small runs of textbooks - such as those in Turkish or Serbian - unless the MOE arranges&#13;
subsidies for such books. The following further issues have been identified:&#13;
*   A major issue is Prosvetno Delo's present representation at various levels in the textbook&#13;
approval procedure. If all textbook publishers in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&#13;
are "equal", then they either should all be represented (e.g., through the Association of&#13;
Publishers) or there should be no publisher representation on approval committees at all.&#13;
*   The transparency and fairness of the evaluation procedure should be investigated and improved.&#13;
At present, the public perception is that the current procedure is far from being fair and open,&#13;
with most important decisions made between the PIM (where many professionals are authors of&#13;
textbooks) and Prosvetno Delo, which employs PIM members on its editorial boards.&#13;
*   As for content, Prosvetno Delo staff rightly point out that an overloaded curriculum leads to&#13;
overloaded, fact-crammed books to ensure full coverage of the curriculum. Textbook reform&#13;
must obviously go hand in hand with curriculum reform efforts, already underway.&#13;
* The physical quality of the books will also need to be improved so that they last longer. Better-&#13;
quality, sewn, hard-back textbooks are a better investment for families with more than one child,&#13;
and indeed schools could attempt to formLalize the existing second- or third-hand market and/or&#13;
adopt a rental scheme whereby books are recycled and made available to the next cohort at lower&#13;
cost.&#13;
G.    TEACHER TRAINING-RELATED ISSUES&#13;
1.23   Pre-Service: Now that the new Education Laws of 1995 are in place, and curriculum revisions&#13;
are underway, it is important that pedagogical faculties carefully review and revise their pre-service&#13;
teacher training programs to reflect changes in pedagogy and teaching methods. For example, the&#13;
introduction of an interactive learning approach in elementary schools will mean an entirely new role for&#13;
teachers. Instead of being the source of all knowledge and instruction, they must become facilitators,&#13;
helping children to be active in their own learning and allowing them to work in flexible groupings on&#13;
varying tasks using a wide variety of books and rnaterials. In particular, pre-service teacher training&#13;
should place far greater emphasis on the assessment of pupil leaming and progress, and less emphasis on&#13;
teaching as if it were an end in itself. The following issues have been identified:&#13;
* Institutions: There has been a clear breakdown in relations between teaching faculties and&#13;
schools. There is a need to involve schools more fully in the development of training programs,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
and to make sure that teacher trainees spend more time in schools doing student teaching before&#13;
they are certified.&#13;
* Content: There is a need to change the teacher training curriculum guidelines to give more focus&#13;
to teaching methodologies and to practice teaching. Teacher trainees also need more exposure to&#13;
new and innovative uses of learning aids. At the same time, a mechanism needs to be&#13;
established to define and monitor standard competencies which students must achieve prior to&#13;
certification. There is also a clear need to provide more opportunities for teacher training faculty&#13;
staff to update their skills.&#13;
1.24   In-service: The introduction of educational reforms always relies heavily on in-service teacher&#13;
training, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's reforms will require innovations in this field&#13;
given the lack of resources to undertake traditional in-service training workshops for all teachers in the&#13;
medium term. At present, however, the PIM is severely over-stretched and will not be able to deliver&#13;
such a campaign without developing new strategies for providing this training. Outside support will be&#13;
essential, particularly in areas where the PIM's own expertise is lacking. The following issues have been&#13;
identified:&#13;
*  Budget: Funding for in-service teacher training in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is&#13;
woefully inadequate by any measure. Of the $60,000 equivalent budgeted for in-service training&#13;
in 1995-96 (out of the $223 million public budget for education), only 25 percent was actually&#13;
executed. Financing for this essential educational input needs to be increased and executed.&#13;
*  Strategy and Planning: A new strategy for carrying out in-service teacher training needs to be&#13;
developed which focuses on a "cascade approach" in which "mentor teachers" or "mentor&#13;
schools" are used to deliver training at the school level. Once a new strategy has been identified,&#13;
mechanisms will need to be developed for planning and prioritizing training needs. In addition,&#13;
a mechanism should be found for providing schools with up-to-date information about new&#13;
developments in education. The eventual goal should be to expand the range of training&#13;
providers, as it is unlikely that the PIM will ever have adequate capacity to provide all required&#13;
in-service training.&#13;
*   Content: Recent in-service training initiatives have been overly short and superficial -- partly due&#13;
to the severely limited funding for these activities. Focus needs to be given to increasing and&#13;
monitoring the quality of training that is delivered and to making sure that training addresses&#13;
teaching methods as much, if not more than, subject content.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

2. THE RECOVERY OBJECTIVES FOR EDUCATION AND THE&#13;
BANK'S RESPONSE&#13;
2.1    Given the institutional weakness of the MOE, it will not be possible to address the broad range of&#13;
issues identified above all at once and in a well-coordinated and effective manner. Nor is it possible at&#13;
the present time for the MOE to develop a detailed, coherent and realistic strategy for addressing these&#13;
issues in the medium term. In fact, the development of such a strategy -- best carried out by the people&#13;
of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia themselves as opposed to relying on drafting by external&#13;
consultants -- will entail a participatory process that will require several years and significant external&#13;
support. In the mean time, there are a number of initiatives that can be undertaken in the near term (a) to&#13;
help the MOE prepare its education strategy and related policy reforms, (b) to help the MOE improve its&#13;
capacity to manage public resources more efficienitly, and (c) to have an immediate impact on improving&#13;
the quality of education delivered in the system.&#13;
2.2    Development of a medium term strategy: The MOE is currently negotiating with&#13;
UNESCO/UNDP to fund a participatory process aimed at defining long range education goals and a&#13;
medium term strategy for achieving these goals. UNESCO staff have drafted an agenda and terms of&#13;
reference, aimed at dissemination of information and consensus building, and UNDP funding is currently&#13;
being considered for the undertaking. If this fundling does not materialize, alternative sources of finance&#13;
for this initiative will become a priority for the MOE and other interested donors.3 In addition to this&#13;
initiative, Japanese Trust Fund resources have been used by the Bank to finance background papers and&#13;
recommendations, as well as project proposals, in the areas of education finance, assessments and&#13;
curriculum, teacher training, textbooks and school mapping. These documents, which are currently&#13;
available, will provide a foundation for policy discussions and help expedite the development of detailed&#13;
sub-sector goals and strategies. The development of a long term strategy for education by December&#13;
1998 may be a formal conditionality under the Social Sectors Adjustment Credit (SSAC).&#13;
2.3   Improving management capacity and reforming institutions: Like development of a medium&#13;
term strategy for education, improving management capacity and reforming institutions in the former&#13;
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's education sector is a medium to long term undertaking. But, a good&#13;
start can be made to achieving these goals over thie next two years. The initiative aimed at developing a&#13;
medium term strategy is itself a tool for improving planning, analysis and management skills within the&#13;
MOE. The initiative calls for creation of an Education Planning office in the MOE which will serve as&#13;
the institutional focal point for ensuring a more rigorous approach to public resource management. The&#13;
development of a school mapping data base and aL three year school rehabilitation program as preparation&#13;
for this project is an important indicator of the MOE's commitment to improving its management&#13;
capacity. In addition, donor investment activities in the field of curriculum development and teaching&#13;
methodology, reform of secondary technical and vocational education, student assessment, teacher&#13;
IDA financing for this initiative was rejected by the MOE based on UNDP/UNESCO's expressed intention to&#13;
provide financing and the Government's general desire to reduce to an absolute minimum the borrowing of&#13;
IDA funds to finance technical assistance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
training and textbook reform (the latter three to be supported by this project) all include significant&#13;
capacity building and institutional reform goals.&#13;
2.4   Improving the quality of education in the classroom now: Taking steps to begin improving the&#13;
quality of education delivered in the classroom in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia need not&#13;
be delayed until the MOE has developed an agreed medium term strategy and made significant strides in&#13;
improving its management capacity and reforming its institutions. The first priority in terms of having&#13;
an immediate impact in the classroom in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is to mobilize&#13;
investment resources to improve the learning environment in schools of the former Yugoslav Republic of&#13;
Macedonia, particularly in high poverty areas where schools tend to be in the worst physical condition.&#13;
Improving the learning environment in schools of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is the&#13;
main short term goal of this project. A second immediate priority is to continue and even accelerate the&#13;
process of improving the quality of educational inputs. The Pedagogical Institute of the former Yugoslav&#13;
Republic of Macedonia, working closely with UNICEF, has already made significant progress in&#13;
updating primary school curricula grades 1-4 and introducing an interactive teaching methodology in&#13;
pilot primary schools. This success will need to be expanded, both in terms of reaching other grade&#13;
levels and in terms of making sure that other educational inputs such as teacher training, textbooks and&#13;
materials are updated to respond to the curricular and methodological reforms. Each of the capacity&#13;
building activities included in this project is also aimed at having a direct short term impact on&#13;
improving educational inputs in the schools.&#13;
2.5    The Bank's response to the above objectives is to respond quickly by devoting the largest portion&#13;
of its available investment resources to primary school rehabilitation, which is the MOE's highest&#13;
investment priority, and to devote a smaller share of resources to leveraging the support of other donors&#13;
aimed at capacity building, institutional development and improving the quality of educational inputs.&#13;
At the same time, through preparation and eventual supervision of the SSAC, the Bank will have a major&#13;
input into the development of the MOE's long term strategy. In addition to focusing on an overall&#13;
strategy, the following issues are currently being considered for conditionality in the context of the&#13;
SSAC: (a) reducing teaching and non-teaching staff in selected areas using the school mapping data base;&#13;
(b) reducing the university admissions quotas for non-fee paying teacher training candidates; (c)&#13;
increasing non-salary recurrent budgets for key areas such as in-service teacher training, curriculum&#13;
development and evaluating student performance; (d) re-organizing and reforming the Pedagogical&#13;
Institute of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia which is responsible for developing key&#13;
educational inputs; and (e) developing a three-year school rehabilitation investment program. The&#13;
Bank's approach puts a premium on close, continuous aid-coordination in order to co-ordinate policy and&#13;
strategy advice, as well as to utilize the comparative advantage of various donors in terms of field-based&#13;
staff, technical advice, training and funding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.1    The project has three objectives: (a) to imlprove the learning environment in high poverty and&#13;
predominately rural areas through rehabilitating 50-56 primary schools; (b) to improve the quality of&#13;
educational inputs by facilitating teacher training reform and textbook reform; and (c) to strengthen the&#13;
MOE's capacity to carry out teacher training, student assessment and curriculum development.&#13;
A.    SCHOOL REHABILITATION&#13;
3.2    The project will finance the rehabilitation of 50-56 primary schools (US$ 10.6 million) located&#13;
exclusively in high poverty areas throughout the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; no new&#13;
construction will be financed under the project. Approximately 15,000 primary school pupils, or about 8&#13;
percent of total primary enrollment, is expected to benefit from the school rehabilitation component.&#13;
3.3    These 50-56 primary schools represent the first two year phase of a three-year school&#13;
rehabilitation program. The investment program has been developed on the basis of information&#13;
compiled in a newly developed school mapping data base. The data base includes information on the&#13;
physical status of schools, basic indicators such as student and teacher numbers and their specialty areas,&#13;
and demographic information.4 This information has allowed the MOE to assign a priority rehabilitation&#13;
status to each of its school facilities. The information shows that of the approximately 1,050 primary&#13;
school facilities in the system, about one quarter are in need of significant rehabilitation, and most of&#13;
those are in rural and high poverty areas. The standard of about 25 major primary school rehabilitation&#13;
projects per year is driven by both funding limitations -- a financing gap still exists for this component --&#13;
and the MOE's untested implementation capacity. The amount of funding for school rehabilitation under&#13;
the project is based on this realistic standard. If cofinancing is not forthcoming, the MOE will simply&#13;
not implement the second year of planned school rehabilitation, reducing project coverage to about 20&#13;
schools. Given the serious needs in terms of capital renewal, major capital investments should continue&#13;
in primary education well into the next century. Additional sources of external funding will be required&#13;
following this project for both primary and secondary education.&#13;
3.4    Schools to be financed under the project will be selected from the MOE's priority investment&#13;
program using the MOE's internal ranking system for physical status to establish priority. In addition,&#13;
the Bank has requested that the following general criteria be applied: (a) selection should be limited to&#13;
primary schools; (b) the schools must be in a state of serious physical deterioration which poses a threat&#13;
to effective learning as well as to the safety of children; (c) the schools must be in high poverty areas&#13;
(using school mapping criteria for poverty designation) and preferably in rural areas; (d) the schools&#13;
must not have declining enrollment over the past five years, and must be used at full capacity or be&#13;
overcrowded; and (e) no school should be located closer than four kilometers to another primary school&#13;
unless the potential for consolidation has been explicitly explored and communicated to the Bank. With&#13;
4   In addition to providing informnation with which to define physical rehabilitation priorities, the school mapping&#13;
data base is expected to be used to help the MOE plan and monitor its program to reduce teacher numbers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
regard to (e) above, the Bank will only approve schools which are located within four kilometers from&#13;
another primary schools on the basis of written justification. In the case of overcrowding, limited&#13;
extensions of classroom facilities will be accepted. A description of the methodology used in the MOE's&#13;
investment programming and for school selection under the project is attached in Appendix 3.&#13;
3.5    Rehabilitation costs are estimated at about $200 per square meter. The project will also finance&#13;
local works supervision services estimated to cost between 1-2 percent of the value of each civil works&#13;
contract. Damage assessments and, where needed, architectural designs have been financed by localities&#13;
and/or the MOE and will be financed under the proposed project only in exceptional cases. A&#13;
"Statement of Commitment for School Maintenance", signed by the head of the local Council of Parents&#13;
and witnessed by a representative from the MOE, will be required prior to final approval of each&#13;
individual school to benefit from project financing. The "Statement of Commitment for School&#13;
Maintenance" will make the local Council of Parents responsible for routine maintenance of facilities,&#13;
through monetary contributions or in kind support.&#13;
B.    TEXTBOOK PILOT&#13;
3.6    The project will finance a textbook production and financing pilot (US$ 0.7 million) aimed at, in&#13;
the short term, stimulating private sector publisher involvement in textbook market of the former&#13;
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and, in the medium term, improving the pedagogic and physical&#13;
quality of books and controlling their costs.&#13;
3.7    The demand for new and better textbooks in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is at a&#13;
watershed. A new curriculum for elementary grade I was approved for introduction in schools&#13;
beginning in September 1996. This curriculum is more "child-centered" and focused on interactive&#13;
teaching techniques than was the previous one, but there are as yet no textbooks available to complement&#13;
this new approach to learning. New curricula for grades 2-4 have been drafted and it is expected that&#13;
these will be approved for use beginning in September 1997; new curricula for grades 5-8 are under&#13;
preparation and should be presented for approval during the 1997-98 school year.&#13;
3.8   It is clearly impractical to attempt to produce new textbooks for all primary levels and subjects&#13;
all at once, or even in the short term. Education authorities accept that the best strategy for meeting the&#13;
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's textbook needs in the medium term is to invite competition&#13;
among publishers. There are quite a number of private sector publishers in the former Yugoslav&#13;
Republic of Macedonia which possess good basic publishing skills, but will require some training to help&#13;
them respond to the specialized needs of textbook publishing. Moreover, private sector publishers do&#13;
not have the capacity, at present, to develop a broad range of textbooks all at once -- and financial&#13;
resources are, in any case, not available to stimulate such a response among private publishers.&#13;
3.9    Given this situation, the MOE has decided to proceed as follows: the current "socially-owned"&#13;
publisher, Prosvetno Delo, a de-facto if not a legal monopoly enterprise, will attempt to produce new&#13;
textbooks which correspond to the new curricula for grades 1-2 during 1997. At the same time, the MOE&#13;
will launch a pilot designed to produce new textbooks for grade 3 for the 1998/99 school year. In&#13;
addition to stimulating private sector involvement in the textbook market, lessons are expected to be&#13;
learned from the pilot and applied to provision of further new textbooks for primary levels in subsequent&#13;
years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
3.10   Under the pilot, an independent Textbook Approval Board, appointed by the Minister of&#13;
Education, will be established to evaluate tenders for the production of two alternative language and two&#13;
alternative mathematics textbooks for grade three to be published in four languages of instruction used at&#13;
the primary level. Establishment of the Textbook Approval Board will be a condition of disbursement&#13;
for this component. Private publishers will receive small grants which will allow them to produce&#13;
textbook samples for evaluation and for eventual distribution and marketing to schools. Schools would&#13;
be given a choice between the alternative books, which would be distributed to students for a rental fee&#13;
established by the Textbook Approval Board. Receipts would be used to begin building a revolving fund&#13;
for the purchase of textbooks in subsequent years. Publishers would deliver books directly to schools on&#13;
the basis of contracts signed with the MOE. It is expected that, pending lessons learned during the pilot,&#13;
this system would be expanded and schools would begin to use their revolving funds to contract directly&#13;
with publishers for books.&#13;
3.1 1   Resources needed to carry out this pilot include, (a) the cost of the actual textbooks to be&#13;
procured (about $400,000 equivalent) and a small sum (about $20,000) with which to provide seed grants&#13;
to private publishers; (b) technical assistance to facilitate establishing the Textbook Approval Board,&#13;
organizing and evaluating the tender, establishing the revolving funds and rental schemes, and training&#13;
private sector publishers; and (c) study tours to neighboring countries to allow senior education officials&#13;
to examine ongoing textbook provision schemes. The IDA credit would finance only the actual cost of&#13;
the textbooks procured, and additional funding; in the amount of about $300,000 is expected to be&#13;
provided by the local Soros Foundation to provide technical assistance, training, seed grants and study&#13;
tours. A detailed description of this project component is available in the project files.&#13;
C.    TEACHIER TRAINING INITIATIVE&#13;
3.12   The project will support a teacher training initiative (US$0.7 million) aimed at helping the MOE&#13;
to begin introducing modern interactive teaching techniques in both pre-service and in-service teacher&#13;
training, as well as helping the MOE to reconsider the approaches and institutional arrangements&#13;
currently in use for both pre-service and in-service teacher training.&#13;
3.13   Authorities responsible for teacher training in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are&#13;
faced with much the same daunting challenge as described above for the textbook sector. New curricula&#13;
based on modern teaching methodology are rapidly being introduced, and the great majority of the&#13;
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's over 13,000 primary school teachers have little or no&#13;
exposure to these new curriculum objectives and methods. Because teacher numbers will be declining&#13;
(although some new teachers will be hired), the obvious priority has been given to in-service training.&#13;
The Pedagogical Institute of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (PIM), which is responsible for&#13;
in-service training, cannot hope to begin to address current needs using its traditional approach of&#13;
organizing short-course seminars in which PIM and occasional education faculty staff (working as&#13;
consultants) deliver training directly to teachers. The PIM is, therefore, committed to expanding new&#13;
approaches that it has recently piloted with the help of UNICEF. These include a reliance on mentor&#13;
teachers, training of trainers and a systematic effort to decentralize teacher in-service training&#13;
responsibility.&#13;
3.14   The MOE has selected the development of a Teacher Resource Center, to be used jointly by a&#13;
Teaching Faculty and a district level PIM office, as the most appropriate vehicle for beginning to&#13;
implement a new strategy for delivering in-service teacher training in the former Yugoslav Republic of&#13;
Macedonia. The project will finance developmnent of the Center to be located, tentatively, at the teaching&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
faculty in Bitola. The Center would be developed to facilitate the following goals: (a) to help&#13;
decentralize responsibility for in-service training and move it closer to schools and teachers; (b) to help&#13;
engender closer cooperation between the district PIM office and the Bitola Faculty of Education, which&#13;
would jointly use the facility; (c) to provide a facility for ongoing in-service training initiatives which&#13;
will be used on a full time basis to improve teacher skills; (d) to provide facilities for teacher trainers and&#13;
trainees from the Bitola teaching faculty to develop their skills; and (e) to provide existing teachers with&#13;
a facility for self-help. The IDA credit would be used to finance equipment, small works and&#13;
educational materials for the center.&#13;
3.15   In terms of institutional support and strategy development, the project will also support training&#13;
for a newly created Teacher Training Council. Training support will assist the Council to (a) identify&#13;
and prioritize training issues; (b) expose teacher training authorities in the former Yugoslav Republic of&#13;
Macedonia to the range of training mechanisms and styles available; (c) establish a career structure for&#13;
teachers; (d) formulate the roles, responsibilities and employment terms of school directors; (e) establish&#13;
criteria for teacher evaluation; and (f) establish a framework for monitoring and evaluating teacher&#13;
training projects. The establishment of the Teacher Training Council would be a condition of credit&#13;
effectiveness. Technical assistance and both in-country and external training is expected to be financed&#13;
on a grant basis by the Government of Swizterland for both the teacher resource center and the Teacher&#13;
Training Council components. Detailed descriptions of these project components are available in the&#13;
project files.&#13;
D.    ASSESSMENT INITIATIVE&#13;
3.16   The project will support development of a capacity in the MOE to develop new education&#13;
standards and assess pupil learning at both the primary and secondary levels (US$ 0.5 million). The&#13;
medium term goal of this initiative is to ensure that, within 4-5 years, every eligible pupil in secondary&#13;
schools of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia can be given a new Matura examination at the&#13;
end of four year secondary schooling which is (a) carefully designed and constructed, (b) linked with&#13;
national standards and new curriculum objectives, and (c) composed of questions which ask for more&#13;
than recall of factual knowledge and which can demonstrate what pupils know, understand and can do.&#13;
In the process of achieving this goal, all methods and instruments for assessing pupil learning in schools&#13;
will be reviewed and improved, and a cadre of trained professionals will be formed to establish and&#13;
maintain the system. These professionals would be assigned to an Assessment Unit, located in the PIM,&#13;
the establishment of which -- in terms of staffing and budget allocation -- would be a condition of credit&#13;
effectiveness. The Assessment Unit would work closely with district level PIM offices to develop and&#13;
implement their exams.&#13;
3.17   IDA funding for this initiative will be used to equip the Assessment Unit as well as participating&#13;
local PIM offices. Technical assistance and both in-country and external training support is expected to&#13;
be funded by the Government of the Netherlands in cooperation with a Dutch assessment agency, CITO,&#13;
and the National Examinations Centre in Ljubljana, Slovenia, where a new Matura examination was&#13;
successfully introduced in 1995. A detailed description of this project component is available in the&#13;
project files.&#13;
E.     PROJECT MANAGEMENT UNIT&#13;
3.18   The project would provide financing in the amount of (US$ 0.1) to cover the incremental&#13;
recurrent costs of a Project Management Unit (PMU), which would primarily take responsibility for civil&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
works and equipment procurement and works supervision, as well as accounting and disbursement of&#13;
project funds. Funds would be used to cover staff salaries (for non-civil servants), a vehicle and minor&#13;
project operating costs. A number of capable engineering, management and support staff have already&#13;
been assigned to this unit. The PMU has been established in the new Investments Unit in the MOE and&#13;
the Head of Investments will act as PMU Director. The PMU may also manage funding from the&#13;
European Union in support of secondary education reform.&#13;
F.    PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING PLAN&#13;
3.19   Project Costs. Total project costs are estimated at US$12.6 million. No physical contingencies&#13;
or price contingencies have been included, given the expected short disbursement period of this project&#13;
and the fact that the project finances a slice oifthe MOE's ongoing school rehabilitation investment&#13;
program. The proposed IDA credit of US$5.0 million equivalent will finance 40 percent of total project&#13;
costs. Government financing of US$0.6 million will cover 6 percent of the school rehabilitation&#13;
component, including all taxes on IDA-financed contracts. Dutch, Swiss and Soros Foundation parallel&#13;
financing is expected to contribute to the capacity building components. The project is expected to&#13;
disburse over a 24 month implementation period, although most disbursements are expected to occur in&#13;
the first project year. Project costs are presented in Appendix 1.&#13;
3.20   Financing Plan. The project would be financed through a proposed IDA Credit of US$5.0&#13;
million equivalent and parallel financing from various donors, as shown in Table 3.1.&#13;

4. PROJECT RATIONALE&#13;
4.1    This section provides the overall economic justification and rationale for the project.&#13;
4.2    Linkage to Economic and Sector Work. There is consensus in economic literature, generally&#13;
accepted in the Bank, that investment in humaLn capital generates a positive economic return to both an&#13;
individual and to the society at large. A variety of research has shown what is intuitively evident: in a&#13;
country at the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's stage of development and transition,&#13;
investnent in improving the quality of learning inputs such as curriculum, textbooks and teachers has a&#13;
powerful impact on improving student achievement and earning potential. A growing number of studies&#13;
suggest that investment in school infrastructure also has a significant impact on student learning,&#13;
particularly if it is done in conjunction with qualitative improvements in other inputs to the education&#13;
system. Investment in severely damaged and unsafe schools, such as those found in the former Yugoslav&#13;
Republic of Macedonia, has additional benefits in terms of targeting public resources on the poor and&#13;
averting a potential loss of life (the formerYugoslav Republic of Macedonia is located in an earthquake&#13;
zone).&#13;
4.3    The calculation of social and individual rates of return to education for the former Yugoslav&#13;
Republic of Macedonia has not been deemed necessary for justification of this project for several&#13;
reasons: (a) comparable rate of return analysis exists for other countries at the former Yugoslav Republic&#13;
of Macedonia's stage of development and transition; (b) such an analysis in the former Yugoslav&#13;
Republic of Macedonia, at this time, would likely be highly unreliable given data constraints and&#13;
distorted incentives due to labor market distortions, the current quality problems in education and high&#13;
unemployment; and (c) the project is small, simple and, because it is focused on targeting high poverty&#13;
areas, well-justified on equity grounds. The social rate of return to education in the former Yugoslav&#13;
Republic of Macedonia -- particularly for primary and secondary education -- is likely to be significant&#13;
given its focus on broad societal values and other externalities, as well as labor productivity/income. It&#13;
is likely that a proper calculation of the individual returns to investing in primary and secondary&#13;
education is somewhat low due to the limited dispersion of wages in the country and high&#13;
unemployment. The limited wage dispersion can be attributed in large part to the public sector&#13;
dominated labor market that does not accord a significant wage premium to more skilled workers.&#13;
Improvements to the quality and relevance of education -- which are the objectives of this project -- and&#13;
the private sector led economic growth which is occurring, should jointly create an environment that will&#13;
increase the individual rates of return to education in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as&#13;
well as the social and economic benefit to society at large.&#13;
4.4    Linkage to CAS. The Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy, (Report No. 14739-MK, dated&#13;
April 19, 1995), which was presented to the Board on May 16, 1995, includes the following strategies for&#13;
investment lending: (i) assuring adequate infrastructure for economic growth; (ii) supporting critical&#13;
adjustment and development efforts; and (iii) helping to mobilize resources from both official and&#13;
private sources. The Education Rehabilitation Project responds directly to these strategies. Adequate&#13;
primary schools -- particularly in high poverty areas -- are essential infrastructure for long term&#13;
economic growth and transition. Through a focus on educational quality, the project is also aimed at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18-&#13;
making the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's education system more responsive to the needs of&#13;
an emerging market economy. Finally, a high priority has been given in this project to mobilizing other&#13;
resources for education development and to aid coordination in general. The next CAS is likely to give&#13;
particular priority to the need for investing in human resource development in the former Yugoslav&#13;
Republic of Macedonia.&#13;
4.5    Public/Private Justification. In the future, as with most developed market economies, education&#13;
in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is likely to be financed and provided by a mix of public&#13;
and private institutions. Private schooling will eventually be needed to serve the diverse educational&#13;
needs of the population (particularly in secondary and higher education), to reduce public spending on&#13;
higher income students most likely to opt for private schools, and, potentially, for providing competition&#13;
for the services of the public school system. But, as in most developed market economies, a modern&#13;
public education system is likely to remain the main provider and financier of education in the former&#13;
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. An efficient and responsive public education system in the former&#13;
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will continue to be necessary in the long term given the negative&#13;
impact that a fully private education system would entail because of: (a) financial market imperfections&#13;
(inability of individuals to borrow against human capital); and (b) the inability of private providers to&#13;
capture the externalities (more civil society, greater social responsibility, and a more uniform and highly&#13;
educated population, higher labor productivity) generated by an educated work force for the country as a&#13;
whole. The private contribution to public education in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is&#13;
steadily increasing at pre-university levels, where parents pay for books and educational materials and&#13;
contribute to school maintenance and operations, and at higher education, where significant fees have&#13;
recently been established and where student contributions to boarding and educational inputs are&#13;
increasing.&#13;
4.6    Policy Environment. A description of the Government's policy reform efforts and the Bank's&#13;
strategy for supporting those efforts -- mainly through the SSAC -- were included in Section B. It should&#13;
be re-iterated that the Government is committed to the following medium term policy goals: (a) to&#13;
manage public resources for education more efficiently; (b) to improve the quality of education inputs,&#13;
including teachers; (c) to reform the overly specialized secondary education system and make it more&#13;
responsive to the emerging market economy; and (d) to involve private sector publishers in textbook&#13;
production.&#13;
4.7    Analysis of Alternatives. Several alternative project designs were considered: the first alternative&#13;
was no Bank support at all; Alternative 2 was to focus IDA funding for the project more heavily on&#13;
capacity building objectives; Alternative 3 was to increase the amount of Bank funding for the project;&#13;
Alternative 4 was to provide financing in support of secondary or higher education rehabilitation and&#13;
reform; and Alternative 5 was to focus IDA funding on capital investment and work closely with other&#13;
donors to build capacity in the sector:&#13;
Project Not Financed. Without the project, conditions in schools of the former Yugoslav Republic&#13;
of Macedonia would continue to deteriorate at an accelerated pace and cohorts of students --&#13;
particularly those in rural and high poverty areas -- would continue their education in pedagogically&#13;
inappropriate and unsafe physical environments. It is unlikely that the former Yugoslav Republic of&#13;
Macedonia's serious problem of a depleting capital stock would be addressed appropriately in the&#13;
medium term. On the fiscal side, without the project, the Government or beneficiaries would be&#13;
expected to incur higher recurrent costs over the continued life of the school and a higher capital cost&#13;
of rehabilitating an even more damaged school building in the future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19 -&#13;
*  Focus IDA Funding on Capacity Build'ing and Education Reform. Under this alternative, IDA&#13;
funds would be used to finance technical assistance and training in support of capacity building and&#13;
education reform objectives aimed at improving educational quality. This approach was rejected in&#13;
favor of identifying bilateral and NGO funding for capacity building for the following reasons: (i) a&#13;
number of bilaterals and NGOs, which have experience in capacity building projects in education,&#13;
expressed their desire to provide support; (ii) these bilaterals and NGOs can more easily establish&#13;
twinning arrangements with other institutions in their countries which can deliver capacity building&#13;
support -- technical assistance and training -- faster, more effectively and at less cost then would be&#13;
realized through Bank-funded technical assistance procurement; and (iii) the Government of&#13;
Macedonia is highly reluctant to borrow, even on IDA terms, for technical assistance when its capital&#13;
investment needs are largely unmet. The highest priority education reform issues are being&#13;
addressed in the context of the Social Sectors Adjustment Credit. Analysis and recommendations are&#13;
being provided through Japan Grant resources, and will continue as part of project supervision.&#13;
*  Increase the Amount of Bank Fundingfor the Project. Ideally, given capital replenishment needs,&#13;
the priority given to human resource development and the MOE's capacity to implement school&#13;
rehabilitation works, the Bank contribution to this operation should be on the order of $30 million&#13;
over five years. However, only $5 million in IDA funding is currently available for education over&#13;
the next three years, and the Government has decided not to borrow on IBRD terms, at the current&#13;
time, to support school reconstruction.&#13;
*  Provide Financing to Support Secondary and/or Highier Education. Although major investments&#13;
will eventually be needed in secondary and higher education, investment funding for these areas in&#13;
the current project was rejected because (a) the social and economic returns to primary education in a&#13;
country of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's development status are generally accepted&#13;
to be higher than those at secondary and higher education; (b) needed reforms in primary education -&#13;
- modern curriculum development, teacher training innovations, textbook reform -- are already well&#13;
underway, while changes to the structure and content of secondary and higher education will take&#13;
longer to develop a consensus and to implement; (c) the European Union has expressed interest in&#13;
leading the policy dialogue for secondary reforms and providing funding for investments in&#13;
secondary education; and (d) primary e(lucation, which provides the foundation of the education&#13;
system, is a logical place to begin a relationship with educational development in the former&#13;
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, given that both implementation capacity and IDA funding is&#13;
limited. Policy advice, and conditionality, will be forthcoming for secondary and higher education in&#13;
the context of the Social Sectors Adjustment Credit and Japan Grant financing.&#13;
* Fund Primarily Capital Investment and Work Closely with other Donors on Capacity Building.&#13;
The benefits of this adopted approach are given elsewhere in this document (see Benefits section)&#13;
and will not be repeated here. Given the alternatives considered, the adopted approach is the best&#13;
way for the Bank to support the education system of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&#13;
over the next two years. Follow-up operations are likely, however, to be necessary, depending on the&#13;
outcomes and results of the current operation and the support the education sector in the former&#13;
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia receives from other donors.&#13;
4.8    Cost-Benefits/Cost-Effectiveness. Specific cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness analysis has not&#13;
been carried out for this project for the following reasons: (a) the benefits to improving the quality of&#13;
education in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- while intuitively obvious -- are difficult to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
quantify in a best case scenario, and, in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, data are unreliable&#13;
or unavailable; (b) the cost of the resources and time needed to carry out such analysis is not deemed to&#13;
be worth the benefit of such an analysis, at this time, in terms ofjustifying the current project or&#13;
facilitating the Government's own decisions on resource allocation; and (c) the project is simple, low-&#13;
risk and unlikely to lead to major distortions or mistakes in resource allocation.&#13;
4.9    Fiscal Impact. The project would yield benefits in fiscal savings through (a) reduced recurrent&#13;
and investment costs as a result of rehabilitating schools now as opposed to later when schools are more&#13;
depreciated or collapsed, and (b) reduced recurrent costs from consolidating under-utilized schools as a&#13;
result of a reduction in the number of staff, equipment and maintenance expenditure. Fiscal savings from&#13;
the improvement in the learning environment (lower drop out and repetition rates) and improved access&#13;
to schools in under-served areas (future reduction in social assistance and other poverty related benefits),&#13;
which are difficult to quantify as a result of data limitations, have not been estimated. It should be noted,&#13;
however, that savings in recurrent cost deriving from the proposed project, may need to be used to&#13;
maintain or increase the overall Government capital and recurrent budget for school infrastructure, since&#13;
the current budget allocation for capital expenditure is inadequate.&#13;
4.10   Poverty Analysis. Initial results of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia poverty&#13;
assessment work finds -- intuitively -- that households headed by less educated individuals are more&#13;
likely to be poor relative to more educated household heads. Unless addressed, this aspect of poverty is&#13;
likely to persist in the future. Children of households with less educated parents are also less likely to be&#13;
enrolled in school. Rural household heads have completed far fewer years of education, and rural&#13;
children are less likely to be enrolled in school. By rehabilitating mainly rural schools in high poverty&#13;
areas and ensuring that all rehabilitated schools have adequate facilities, this project, in the context of the&#13;
overall education program, will improve the quality and, in some cases, the coverage of education in the&#13;
poorest communities in the country. In doing so, it will contribute to raising low education status in rural&#13;
areas and alleviate one of the fundamental causes of poverty in the former Yugoslav Republic of&#13;
Macedonia.&#13;
4.11   Institutional Capacity and Regulatory Framework. The commitment of the MOE to implement&#13;
the project is high as indicated by the assignment of a number of highly qualified managers and technical&#13;
staff from the MOE to the Project Management Unit. Technical staff have significant experience with&#13;
tendering and works supervision. The construction sector, extremely strong in the former Yugoslavia,&#13;
undoubtedly has sufficient capacity to undertake the volume of work envisioned under the project. The&#13;
regulatory capacity of the MOE's Investment Directorate is adequate and is being strengthened by the&#13;
availability of information produced by the school mapping data base.&#13;
4.12   Environmental Analysis. This project is in Category C. No asbestos or asbestos containing&#13;
materials would be purchased for use in the rehabilitation program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
5. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.    PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
5.1    As mentioned above, a small Project Management Unit (PMU) to support implementation of the&#13;
project has been established in the new Investment Unit with the Head of Investments as its Director. In&#13;
addition to the Director, it comprises three engineers and a bilingual accountant/secretary. It is likely&#13;
that the staff of the unit will be expanded somewhat when European Union financing for secondary&#13;
education becomes available. The staff of the PMU has benefited from training provided during project&#13;
preparation in the areas of procurement, project management, accounting and disbursements. This&#13;
support, provided by a project implementation specialist financed under the SSAC Japan Grant, will&#13;
continue during the first few crucial months of project implementation.&#13;
5.2   Primary School Rehabilitation. The primary responsibility of the PMU will be to organize the&#13;
tendering of civil works contracts and oversee implementation through contracting for works supervision&#13;
services. The PMU Director will work closely with a school rehabilitation working group, already&#13;
established in the MOE to undertake the school mapping data base and prepare the three year school&#13;
rehabilitation investment program. The school rehabilitation working group is charged with identifying&#13;
the approximately 20-25 school rehabilitation contracts that will be submitted for tendering in fall 1997;&#13;
with the remaining 25-30 rehabilitation contracts to be tendered in spring 1998. The 50-56 schools to be&#13;
financed under the project have already been tentatively identified, but a further prioritizing may have to&#13;
take place depending on the availability of co-financing for the investment program. Detailed damage&#13;
assessments and/or architectural designs have already been made available by municipalities and/or the&#13;
MOE for most schools to benefit from project financing. These designs have been assessed favorably by&#13;
an implementation consultant for the Bank, and will be reconfirmed through site visits to each school.&#13;
Additional designs will only be financed by the project if the existing documents are found to be of&#13;
insufficient quality. Procurement of supervision services by district will be carried out in tandem with&#13;
civil works procurement. A detailed implementation schedule for civil works procurement and&#13;
supervision is available in the project files.&#13;
5.3    Capacity Building Initiatives. Because IDA funding will be used to support various capital&#13;
costs of other donor technical assistance andi training initiatives, the PMU implementation responsibility&#13;
for these components is limited to procurement of various educational and office equipment, educational&#13;
materials, vehicles and small works. Similar equipment, materials and vehicles will be packaged&#13;
together in single tenders where possible. Detailed implementation arrangements for consultant support&#13;
and training provided by bilaterals and NGC)s can be found in the various project proposals for&#13;
textbooks, teacher training and assessments, which are available in the project files.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
B.    PROCUREMENT&#13;
5.4   Procurement arrangements are summarized in the Table 5.1 and a procurement plan is attached&#13;
in Appendix 3. Project procurement will be carried out mainly through National Competitive Bidding&#13;
(NCB) for works and National Shopping for (NS) for small equipment and vehicle contracts.&#13;
5.5    Advertising. A General Procurement Notice (GPN) will be published in Development Business.&#13;
The notice will include information about the nature of the goods, works and services to be procured&#13;
under the proposed project and invite interested and eligible suppliers, contractors and consultants to&#13;
send their expression of interest to the MOE PMU. The GPN will also be re-published in the local press.&#13;
The GPN will be followed by specific advertisements in the local press for individual contracts where&#13;
necessary. Bidding documents will be sent to qualified suppliers who respond to the GPN and the&#13;
specific advertisements.&#13;
5.6    Works. All works contracts to be financed by IDA estimated not to exceed $800,000 equivalent&#13;
will be let using National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures, in accordance with the Region's&#13;
NCB documents for works dated July 1995. No single works contract is expected to exceed $800,000,&#13;
and the average contract is expected to be about $200,000. However, it is possible that 1-2 contracts for&#13;
large schools may approach the threshold of $800,000. The contracting industry was well established&#13;
throughout the former Yugoslavia, and this capacity remains in the former Yugoslav Republic of&#13;
Macedonia. However, bidders from outside the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will not be&#13;
excluded from tendering for civil works contracts.&#13;
5.7    Goods. Contracts for equipment, materials and vehicles expected to be less than $200,000&#13;
equivalent but more than $50,000 equivalent, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed $300,000&#13;
equivalent, will be let using International Shopping procedures, in accordance with Bank guidelines.&#13;
National Shopping procedures, in accordance with Bank guidelines, will be used for equipment,&#13;
materials and vehicle contracts expected to be less than $50,000 equivalent, up to an aggregate amount&#13;
not to exceed $300,000 equivalent. No single contract for office equipment, materials or vehicles will&#13;
exceed $200,000, and most should be considerably less. All contracts for the procurement of published&#13;
textbooks under the project will be let using National Competitive Bidding procedures, in accordance&#13;
with documents acceptable to the Bank. The average contract for published textbooks is expected to be&#13;
about $100,000. Direct Contracting (DC) may be used for proprietary items, for reasons of&#13;
compatibility and standardization, and in any other justified case, up to an aggregate amount not to&#13;
exceed $50,000. Any direct contracting to be financed by the IDA credit will need prior Bank approval.&#13;
5.8   Services. Services under the project -- mainly for the supervision of works -- will be procured&#13;
through a request for proposals from a short list of qualified firms/individuals under the provisions of&#13;
paragraph 3.7 (selection based on consultants' qualifications) of the consultants guidelines. The first&#13;
three consultant contracts will require prior review by the Bank. To keep the evaluation process&#13;
manageable, no more than six (but at least three) proposals will be invited to submit statements of&#13;
qualifications and experience. No works supervision contract is expected to be more than $10,000&#13;
equivalent. In the event that donor financing for capacity building technical assistance is not&#13;
forthcoming and IDA funding is used for these purposes, qualified firms will be invited to submit&#13;
proposals for comprehensive packages of consultant services and management of fellowships and&#13;
training in accordance with the "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank&#13;
Borrows" (January 1997).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
5.9    Prior and Post Bank Review of Procurement Documents. Prior review will be required for the&#13;
first three works contracts awarded through National Competitive Bidding (NCB) and for all works&#13;
contracts estimated to exceed $400,000. Prior review will be required for all contracts awarded through&#13;
NCB for textbooks. Due to the necessity to ensure coordination with other donors for the goods and&#13;
services to be procured under this project, prior review will be required for the first three contracts&#13;
awarded through NCB for textbooks and for International (IS) and National Shopping (NS) for goods, as&#13;
well as for the first three contracts for consultant contracts for works supervision. All contracts&#13;
procured through Direct Contracting (DC) will require prior review.&#13;

C.    DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
5.10   Disbursement categories and projected disbursements under the Credit are shown in Table 5.2.&#13;
The Project is expected to be disbursed over a period of 24 months from the date of effectiveness,&#13;
scheduled for October 1997. In order to allow the MOE to take advantage of the summer construction&#13;
season in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, retroactive financing will be permitted up to the&#13;
limit of 1 0 percent of eligible project expenses incurred after May 31, 1997. Twenty percent of Credit&#13;
funds have been included in the unallocated category to afford the Government flexibility should other&#13;
donor financing not be forthcoming. However, most of these funds are expected to be used for civil&#13;
works. The closing date will be December 31, 1999.&#13;

TOTAL                5.00&#13;
5.11   Special Account. To facilitate timely project implementation, payments for agreed project&#13;
actions are to be made from a Special Account in US dollars in a Bank acceptable to IDA. The PMU&#13;
will be responsible for making payments from the Special Account The authorized allocation of the&#13;
Special Account will be US$ 1.0 million, representing about four months of estimated average&#13;
expenditures expected to be paid from the Special Account. The relatively high amount of the authorized&#13;
allocation is based on the Bank's recent experience with school rehabilitation in Bosnia and Herzegovina&#13;
and Albania where civil works contracting for school reconstruction was impeded by inadequate liquidity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
in the Special Account. Replenishment applications would be forwarded to the Bank monthly and will&#13;
include reconciled bank statements as well as other appropriate documents. For large contracts, the Bank&#13;
would make direct payments to suppliers.&#13;
5.12   Statement of Expenditures. Disbursements would be made against Statements of Expenditures&#13;
(SOEs) for goods and civil works contracts of up to US$ 0.4 million. Detailed documents evidencing&#13;
expenditures would be maintained in a central location by the PMU for review by the required audit as&#13;
well as Bank supervision missions. Disbursement for contracts requiring the Bank's prior review would&#13;
be made against presentation to the Bank of full contract documentation.&#13;
D.    PROJECT AUDITS, ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING&#13;
5.13   Accounts. Auditable accounts would be established and maintained by the PMU for the project.&#13;
These accounts would include: (i) a record of withdrawals with copies of all disbursement requests and&#13;
underlying documentation; and (ii) a record of transactions under the Special Account and copies of the&#13;
bank statements pertaining to the account.&#13;
5.14   Audits. The project accounts would be audited annually by independent auditors under terms of&#13;
reference acceptable to the Bank. Audit statements would be prepared for the Special Account and for&#13;
Statements of Expenditures. All audit reports would be made available to the Bank within six months&#13;
after the end of each fiscal year. Project accounts would be maintained for one year after they have been&#13;
audited.&#13;
5.15   Reporting. The project PMU will prepare and furnish to the Bank quarterly: a) progress reports&#13;
showing the status of implementation of the project, and b) financial reports in a format acceptable to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
E.    SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
5.16   Project implementation is expected to proceed rapidly. The Bank will provide intensive support&#13;
in the form of monthly missions to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia by the Task Manager,&#13;
located in Budapest, and a qualified implementation consultant during the crucial time period just prior&#13;
to and after project effectiveness. Following this initial intensive period of about three months,&#13;
supervision resources are expected to focus primarily on facilitating the capacity building components&#13;
and aid-coordination. The location of the Task Manager in the Budapest Human Resources Hub will&#13;
ensure intensive supervision of initial project implementation, and prompt feedback on matters requiring&#13;
a decision by the Bank. Given the straightforward nature of the project and the short implementation&#13;
period, no midterm review will be required.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

6. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
6.1    Benefits. Through improving the environment for leanling, the proposed project will have a&#13;
direct positive impact on the quality of education for about 15,000 children (about 6 percent of primary&#13;
enrollment) in high poverty areas of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. In addition,&#13;
enrollment ratios for primary education are expected to increase in high poverty areas as school facilities&#13;
are improved. The project will also have a positive medium term impact on learning for all primary age&#13;
children in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia through improving teaching skills and teaching&#13;
methodology, improving the quality of textbooks and improving the quality of examinations, which&#13;
provide a standard toward which children and teachers work. In addition to the project's direct impact&#13;
on the quality of education delivered in the classroom, the project will help improve the capacity of the&#13;
MOE to improve the quality of education inputs, to develop and implement programs and to manage&#13;
public resources more efficiently. This latter benefit has already been partially achieved during project&#13;
preparation through development of a school mapping data base, In the long term, improving the quality&#13;
of education will stimulate economic growth through increasing the productivity and flexibility of the&#13;
work force. Lastly, the project will help the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia leverage additional&#13;
grant funding for education, and permit Worldc Bank staff to provide technical advice to the former&#13;
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia during supervision.&#13;
6.2    Risks. The risks attached to this investment are low. Dilapidated primary schools will be&#13;
rehabilitated in high poverty areas. The risk that these schools might not be adequately maintained will&#13;
be addressed by requiring that a contract is signed between the community and the central ministry in&#13;
which the community undertakes maintenance responsibility. There is a risk that the textbook pilot&#13;
financed by the project will fail to prove sustainable. However, if it does fail, a number of books will&#13;
have been delivered into the hands of students, and the MOE will have attained valuable information --&#13;
for a small price -- on how they wish to structure their textbook sector. Finally, there is a risk that&#13;
institutional changes and capacity development in the fields of teacher training, curriculum development&#13;
and students assessments will be slow in forthcoming. This risk has been partially addressed by&#13;
requiring a commitment, in terms of recurrent expenditure, to these activities under the SSAC, and by&#13;
making certain institutional changes conditions of effectiveness and/or disbursement under the Credit.&#13;
The focus on tight aid-coordination under the project also serves to reduce risk in terms of the&#13;
consistency of approach among the donor community. If progress is slow, the donor community will&#13;
have no alternative but to re-evaluate its approach and continue providing technical assistance and&#13;
training at the working level in the medium term.&#13;

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AN RECOMMENDATION&#13;
7.1    Agreements Reached. The following agreements and understandings were reached at project&#13;
negotiations: (a) a "Statement of Commitment for School Maintenance", giving local parent councils&#13;
responsibility for routine maintenance of facilities, through monetary contributions or in kind support,&#13;
will be signed by the local Council of Parents and witnessed by a representative for the MOE prior to&#13;
final approval of each individual school to benelFit from project financing (see para. 3.5); (b) as&#13;
conditions of effectiveness, the MOE will formally establish, through a Ministerial decree, the following&#13;
entities: an assessment unit, including a head and professional staff, and a Teacher Training Council,&#13;
comprised of representatives of teacher training institutions, the MOE and the Pedagogical Institute (see&#13;
paras. 3.15 and 3.16); (c) the establishment of a Textbook Approval Committee will be a condition of&#13;
disbursement for funds allocated to procuring published textbooks (see para. 3.10); and (d) the&#13;
Government agreed that if grant funding from other donors is not made available by March 31, 1998,&#13;
MOE and IDA will meet formally to discuss alternatives and agree on a course of action. Unallocated&#13;
IDA funds (20 percent of the overall credit) could be made available at that time to finance technical&#13;
assistance and training for the teacher training, textbooks and assessments components.&#13;
7.2    Recommendation. Subject to the above agreements and understandings, the proposed project&#13;
provides a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of SDR 3.6 million (US$5.0 million equivalent) to the&#13;
Government of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.&#13;

School Rehabilitation Overview&#13;
Introduction&#13;
I.           During the 1996-97 school year, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia supported&#13;
1,046 public primary school facilities for its approximately 260,000 primary pupils. About 640 of these&#13;
facilities are comprehensive schools, meaning they cover grades 1-8, as well as increasingly, in urban&#13;
areas, kindergarten. Slightly less than half of these comprehensive schools are considered to be located,&#13;
by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia population density standards, in rural areas. The&#13;
remaining schools cover grades 1-4, and are predominantly located in rural areas. Nearly all rural areas&#13;
in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are considered high poverty areas for the purposes of this&#13;
project. Pupils are organized into 10,220 classes ('grades 1-4 are teacher specific and grades 5-8 are&#13;
subject specific). Nearly all schools in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are double shifted,&#13;
and some triple shifting exists both in rural and urban areas.&#13;
2.            Current Ministry of Education and Physical Culture (MOE) estimates are that&#13;
approximately 250 primary school facilities, of wlhich about 200 are in rural areas, currently suffer from&#13;
serious physical problems and/or structural faults which render them unsafe (the former Yugoslav&#13;
Republic of Macedonia is in an earthquake zone) and serve to distract and demotivate students and&#13;
teachers. More than half of primary school facilities in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&#13;
were built before 1960, and nearly all of the 250 schools identified as having serious physical problems&#13;
fall in that category. In addition to structural faults which could cause schools to collapse in an&#13;
earthquake, most of these schools suffer from a range of physical problems including: inadequate&#13;
roofing, progressive foundation erosion, non-functioning sanitary facilities, lack of water and sanitary&#13;
facilities, inefficient and/or inadequate heating, inadequate lighting, and lack of adequate classroom&#13;
space.&#13;
Investment Program Ranking&#13;
3.           In order to begin to manage public school facilities more efficiently, a working group of&#13;
engineers in the MOE began preparation of a school mapping data base in early 1997 with support from&#13;
the SSAC Japan Grant. This data base is the first step in the MOE's efforts to develop a comprehensive&#13;
management information system. The short term objective of this project is, however, two fold: (a) to&#13;
prepare a three-year school rehabilitation investment program; and (b) to begin the process of&#13;
rationalizing school facilities in terms of the potential for consolidation.&#13;
4.            Significant progress was made during the first half of 1997 in terms of collecting&#13;
information on the physical status of schools, as well as on basic educational and demographic&#13;
information. This information has allowed the MOE to begin the process of ranking schools by a five&#13;
step level of priority for rehabilitation. The MOE's first level priority is given to schools with serious&#13;
structural faults which pose a threat to the safety of children. Within this category, enrollment numbers&#13;
and the degree of overcrowding is used to give further priority to schools. All schools to be financed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-38 -&#13;
APPENDIX 3&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
under the proposed project fall into this first priority category. A second level of priority is given to&#13;
those schools which suffer from serious physical, but non-structural problems which hinder the learning&#13;
environment (see examples above). Schools in this category are also further prioritized by enrollment&#13;
numbers and the degree of overcrowding. A third level of priority has been given to schools with&#13;
physical problems which are not currently urgent but where these is a risk that physical quality could&#13;
begin to deteriorate. Levels four and five are allocated, respectively, to older schools (more than 20&#13;
years) which are relatively well-maintained and to schools that will not need significant investment for at&#13;
least ten years. A similar exercise has been carried out for schools at the secondary and pre-school&#13;
levels.&#13;
5.            As mentioned above, approximately 250 primary schools, or one quarter of primary&#13;
school facilities, currently fall into priority levels one and two in the MOE's ranking system. Although&#13;
the information is or will soon be available in the data base, the MOE does not currently use rural-urban&#13;
or poverty indicators as criteria for prioritizing schools for rehabilitation for its own purposes. However,&#13;
the data base does make two further important distinctions that have an impact on school ranking. One is&#13;
the case of low-capacity utilization, and the other is the case of schools located witlhin four kilometers of&#13;
another school (numbers for both these categories will be provided by negotiations). Schools which fall&#13;
into this category are being earmarked, and the MOE is committed to undertaking a serious analysis, as&#13;
part of the overall school mapping exercise, to consider the potential for consolidation and/or adoption of&#13;
multi-grade teaching techniques (which are already used in many rural schools). Because there are more&#13;
than enough level one and two schools, which do not fall into these low utilization and proximity&#13;
categories, to construct a realistic three-year primary school investment program, the rationalization of&#13;
the primary school network on these grounds is not an urgent issue, at this time, for defining investment&#13;
priorities. However, the MOE is aware that such efficiency issues are a high priority for the&#13;
Government, and will need to be addressed in order to justify both external and Government resources&#13;
for capital investments for education in the future. It should also be noted that the need to deliver&#13;
primary education in multiple languages and ethnic sensibilities in terms of community school facilities&#13;
are legitimate constraints to be addressed in the process of rationalizing Macedonia's school&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
World Bank Selection Criteria&#13;
6.            Schools to be financed under the Education Rehabilitation Project will be selected from the&#13;
MOE's priority investment program using the MOE's internal ranking system to establish priority. In&#13;
addition, the Bank has requested that the following general criteria be applied: (a) selection should be&#13;
limited to primary schools in keeping with the overall project rationale; (b) the schools must be in a state of&#13;
serious physical deterioration which poses a threat to effective learning as well as to the safety of children&#13;
(levels I and 2 of the MOE ranking exercise); (c) the schools must be in high poverty areas and preferably&#13;
in rural areas; (d) the schools must not have declining enrollment over the past five years, and must be used&#13;
at full capacity or be overcrowded; and (e) no school should be located closer than four kilometers to&#13;
another primary school unless the potential for consolidation has been explicitly explored and&#13;
communicated to the Bank. The following points provide more detail on specific criteria:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
APPENDIX 3&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
*  With regard to (c) above, the Bank has worked withi the MOE and the Statistical Office of the former&#13;
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which has recently participated in a World Bank-financed Poverty&#13;
Assessment, to define high poverty areas in the context of education. For purposes of this project, high&#13;
poverty areas are defined as all rural communities with populations of less than 10,000, and those&#13;
suburban or semi-urban communities in which more than 30 percent of adult residents are receiving&#13;
some form of social assistance payments.&#13;
*  With regard to (d) above, high priority has been given to addressing overcrowding problems --&#13;
including triple shifting -- which serve to reduce learning time and distract teachers and pupils from&#13;
learning. The need for double shifting in most schools and the MOE's standard for maximum class size&#13;
-- 30-35 students per class -- will be used as standards for rehabilitation designs. In the case of severe&#13;
and consistent overcrowding, limited extensions of classroom facilities will be accepted.&#13;
*  With regard to (e) above, the Bank will only finance schools which are located within four kilometers&#13;
from another primary schools on the basis of written justification which demonstrates the lack of&#13;
potential for consolidation.&#13;
7.            Applying the above criteria to its own ranking system, the MOE will identify 50-56 priority&#13;
schools to benefit from financing under the project. The Bank will verify the selection process and visit&#13;
schools on a sampling basis prior to final approval for financing.&#13;
Construction Standards&#13;
8.            Many older schools in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia do not comply with&#13;
Government building regulations concerning structural safety (particularly seismic protection). Most of&#13;
these schools also do not provide the appropriate physical environment for learning that are prescribed in&#13;
the current MOE standards for pre-university building facilities. The design and scope of rehabilitation&#13;
interventions in schools to be financed under the project would, therefore, incorporate the minimum&#13;
standards summarized below.&#13;
*  Structural Safety: All buildings to be rehabilitated will be structurally reinforced in order to comply&#13;
strictly with the latest provisions of the National Building Code, in particular, those that pertain to&#13;
the seismic resistance of the building structures.&#13;
*  Materials and Construction Methods: No asbestos materials will be used in the construction or&#13;
rehabilitation of the schools. In the process of rehabilitation, appropriate measures will be&#13;
introduced in the construction contracts concerning the safe removal and disposal, by the works&#13;
contractors, of any asbestos materials found in the buildings to be rehabilitated.&#13;
* Student Capacity: School facilities will be rehabilitated or, in limited cases, extended in such a&#13;
manner that the total school enrollment can be accommodated into two shifts. As a rule, classrooms&#13;
will be designed to seat 30-35 students. Kinclergarten classrooms should normally accommodate 20-&#13;
25 students. The average dimensions of these classrooms (i.e. square meters of floor area per&#13;
student) will be in accordance with the MOE's established norms of at least one and a half square&#13;
meters of space per child. A limited number of schools located in isolated/remote rural areas, where&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
APPENDIX 3&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
students have to commute long distances in order to attend classes, may be rehabilitated to&#13;
accommodate only one shift. It is unlikely that small schools where multi-grade teaching is required,&#13;
will be justified under the program due to the Government's desire to reach the maximum number of&#13;
pupils with scarce investment resources. However, in such instances, rehabilitation designs would&#13;
take into account the size and number of classrooms needed for multi-grade teaching to occur.&#13;
Amenities: The amenities to be provided (if not available) and upgraded in the affected schools are&#13;
the following:&#13;
(i) Academic facilities:&#13;
- appropriate number of classrooms and general purpose common rooms&#13;
- faculty room and administrative space&#13;
- library with a small reading area&#13;
- some limited school furniture&#13;
(ii) Utilities/Other Features:&#13;
- sanitary facilities for students and teachers&#13;
- appropriate waste/sewage disposal&#13;
- drinking water&#13;
- heating: central heating units for larger schools; room/space heating units for smaller facilities&#13;
- electricity (also in remote rural areas if available)&#13;
- fire protection and emergency escapes&#13;
- access facilitated for disabled students&#13;
- security measures (as appropriate to protect loss of property)&#13;
Exclusions from Project Financing:&#13;
9.     The following types of interventions will not be included for financing under the project:&#13;
- rehabilitation of student boarding areas&#13;
- rehabilitation of school auditoriums for large congregations/cultural activities&#13;
- rehabilitation of vocational/industrial workshops&#13;
- provision of pedagogical equipment (e.g. laboratory/office equipment)&#13;
- installation/rehabilitation of air-conditioning systems&#13;
- installation of telephone/telecommunication systems&#13;
Rehabilitation Costs:&#13;
10.    Rehabilitation costs were based on a unit cost of US$200 per square meter of building area to be&#13;
repaired. Thus the total rehabilitation cost of a damaged school is equal to the gross existing floor area&#13;
of the school (aggregate areas of all floor levels), multiplied by the unit rehabilitation cost. Extensions of&#13;
facilities were based on a unit construction cost of about $350 per square meter. No new construction&#13;
will be financed under the project.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Education Rehabilitation Project for
            Macedonia has three objectives: 1) to improve the learning
            environment in high poverty and predominantly rural areas;
            2) to improve the quality of educational inputs; and 3) to
            strengthen the Education and Physical Culture
            Ministry's capacity to carry out teacher training,
            student assessment and curriculum development. The
            components to achieve these aims include: 1) rehabilitating
            and furnishing 50-56 dilapidated and dangerous primary
            schools in poverty areas; 2) facilitating teacher training
            reform and developing a new system for producing and
            financing piloted textbooks; 3) piloting a new
            teacher-in-service training strategy, developing capacity
            for student assessment covering core primary subjects, and
            establishing a school mapping database.
