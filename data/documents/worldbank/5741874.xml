            The future of aid 1 : the rise of the undergrowth
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This note considers the future of aid
            from the perspective of the 2005-2030 time frame.  It offers
            a possible scenario for the future, with booming private
            remittances and nongovernmental aid flows put to innovative
            uses, eclipsing a less agile, more politically driven
            official aid industry.  A companion note (report 32125)
            offers a second scenario. The notes were written in the
            spirit of plausible stories abougt the future to encourage
            thinking about possible responses.
