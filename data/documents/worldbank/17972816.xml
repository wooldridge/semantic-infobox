&#13;
              OLIVER: I think a good place for us to start, if we may, is to review        was really hired by Bob Garner, because it was Bob who wanted to leaven&#13;
&#13;
              your experience in the Bank.     It is listed chronologically in your fine   this highly academic combination of Rist and Rosenstein-Roden with&#13;
&#13;
              interview with Bob Asher, but there are two or three points I would          somebody that, at least he thought, would be a little more practical or&#13;
&#13;
              like to ask about in passing.                                                down to earth in doing the type of economic analysis he wanted in the&#13;
&#13;
                      In your first incarnation of the Bank, you arrived as Assistant      Bank.     I became the number three man in that team.   It was my mission&#13;
&#13;
              Director in the Economics Department.     TWo or three questions come to     to try to introduce a more critical attitude in appraising country&#13;
&#13;
              mind about that.    Was this the time when Leonard Rist was in charge of     creditworthiness and to do the same with respect to project analysis.&#13;
&#13;
              the research or economics work1     Do you remember Paul Rosenstein-Roden?   OLIVER:    Was the reorganization of 1952, which put a number of&#13;
&#13;
              Even though you served less than a year in that capacity before you          economists into various ares departments and separated the so called&#13;
&#13;
              went off on a couple of special commissions, you were in at the very         central economics work into a rather small department, an attempt to&#13;
&#13;
              beginning of some of the discussions of the economics work in the Bank       deal with this problem of directing more economic analysis toward&#13;
&#13;
              and its distinction from loan work.     Perhaps you would make some          operations E!! se?&#13;
&#13;
              general comments about economics in those days and, if you will, the         KNAPP:    Yes, I think that would be a good description of it.       As a&#13;
&#13;
              evolution of economics work in the Bank after that.                          matter of fact, it was in that reorganization that I left the economics&#13;
&#13;
              KNAPP:    Leonard Rist, the son of Charles Rist, the famous French           work and became the first director of the Bank's work in what we then&#13;
&#13;
              economist, was the first head of the Economics Department in the World       called the Western Hemisphere -- Latin America and the Caribbean.           You&#13;
&#13;
              Bank.    He was the head of the department when I arrived there.      Paul   are right that, on the one hand, the Bank management in the form of&#13;
&#13;
              Rosenstein-Rodan, who was of Eastern European origin, had come down to       Black and Garner were trying to get economists to be more hard-headed.&#13;
&#13;
              become a deputy to Rist.    But the two of them together, frankly, were      but, on the other hand, they saw the great importance of economics work.&#13;

                                                                      3                                                                                4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       They felt that many of the people who had been hired by the Bank to do          that were going to be significant for the work of the Bank.         It was by&#13;
&#13;
       actual loan operations were a bit out of their depth too.     They were         no means an ivory tower.&#13;
&#13;
       accustomed, you might say, to the normal commercial-banking approach to                     You said something about how it became a research&#13;
&#13;
       things and needed more economic content.     As you say, a lot of the           organization doing something like academic research.     There were some&#13;
&#13;
       operational jobs were filled by people who came up ss economists.               criticisms at the time that it was becoming somewhat too academic, but&#13;
&#13;
       OLIVER:    I want to ask a question about the general economics                 I don't think this was ever a serious danger.     The economic obstacles&#13;
&#13;
       work in the Bank -- the sort of work that later became associated with          to development always did require analysis, and, in a sense, the World&#13;
&#13;
       Andy Kamarck and then Hollis Chenery and now Anne Krueger.     It seems to      Bank had a critical mass of people that could do such work making it,&#13;
&#13;
       me that the Bank has always had some trouble knowing exactly what to do         as I think it generally has been, the real center not only in the&#13;
&#13;
       with theoretical economics work -- work that might be done at a                 United States but in the world of Development Economics.     This retreat&#13;
&#13;
       university.   Maybe I could ask a question that relates to this.         When   of the Economics Department from being closely absorbed in Bank&#13;
&#13;
       you became Vice President for Operations in 1956 and Head of the Loan           operations did not reduce its contribution: it rather meant that there&#13;
&#13;
       Committee, if I understand the history correctly, the chief economist           was so much economics work to do that specific country analysis and&#13;
&#13;
       in the Bank was not invited to serve on the Loan Committee.       This          project analysis were more efficiently done in the economics divisions&#13;
&#13;
       implies to me that the general economics work of the Bank, at least             of the area departments, while the broad, long-range, global analysis&#13;
&#13;
       after 1952, was kept separate in some sense.                                    could still be carried on in the Economics Department.&#13;
&#13;
       KNAPP:    I'm just thinking about that.   The reorganization in 1952            OLIVER:    I think that, in your very interesting interview with Bob&#13;
&#13;
       created these new area departments, as we then called them, and staffed         Asher in 1981, you made the point that the 1960s might be thought of as&#13;
&#13;
       them with economists with the idea of having economists that were               the economic phase of the Bank after the Bank had moved out of the&#13;
&#13;
       specialized in Latin American affairs or in Asian affairs or what not.          project infrastructure period and before it got into the being-&#13;
&#13;
       From that time on, the Economics Department, which always maintained            concerned-with-poverty period in the Bank's history.     Would you say a&#13;
&#13;
       its own identity (it was a very important part of the Bank, but, as far         bit about this?&#13;
&#13;
       as operations were concerned, was a support department), was a center           KNAPP:    Well, yes.   There wa15 an evolution from a mere banking attitude&#13;
&#13;
       for research and analysis.    It was a center for the analysis of the           to one that brought investment analysil5 to bear on individual projects,&#13;
&#13;
       world economy in which we operated and the trends in the world economy          especially infrastructure projects.     A new dimension came to be added&#13;

        obscure the fact that the area departments themselves became endowed            administrative budgets of the Bank, but I think he in no sense&#13;
&#13;
        with economic staffs who did the operations analysis; and they came to          initiated it, except that he became convinced of its importance.&#13;

        pay much more attention, for example, to the division of labor among            OLIVER:    It was during his tenure as President of the Bank that the&#13;

        the nations in international trade, which is a very important                   economics staff in the Eronomics Department increased significantly.&#13;

        underlying consideration in financing projects in countries.        They came   He hired from outside the Bank Irving Friedman, who was then in the&#13;
&#13;
        to a much more sophisticated analysis of the economic rates of returns          International Monetary Fund, to come to the Bank, to become what was&#13;
&#13;
        on projects, which was, of course, something they shared with the               then called "The Economic Advisor to the President,"     Would you comment&#13;
&#13;
        project a people.                                                               in general about that event and about the relationship between the&#13;
&#13;
        OLIVER:     At any rate, when you talk about the economic phase in the          growth of the general economics staff and the economics work being&#13;
&#13;
        Bank's history, you're talking much more broadly than about the work            carried out in the area departments?&#13;
&#13;
        being conducted in the Economics Department.      The operations people         KNAPP:    Well, I think George did make an important contribution to the&#13;

        themselves were becoming more interested in economic issues.                    economics work in hiring Irving Friedman, because Irving was an&#13;
&#13;
        KNAPP:     The operations people were more interested, and they had their       activist and a builder and brought a new degree of intellectual&#13;
&#13;
        own economic staffs in the area departments to conduct that kind of             leadership based upon his experience in the Fund,      As I said before,&#13;
&#13;
        analysis.                                                                       George did give budgetary support in terms of personnel.     Irving&#13;

&#13;
        the '60s       from January '63 to April '68.   Was there some connection       together in the Bank to analyze long-range development trends and&#13;
&#13;
        between his presidency and this increase in economics work in the               developments in the world economy.     He came out of the Monetary Fund&#13;

        operations end of the Bank, or do you think this economics evolution            with ita basic interest in the world economy and international trade&#13;
&#13;
        would have occurred regardless of who was president'/                           and the international monetary structure.    He already had, through the&#13;
&#13;
        KNAPP:     I would have to say the latter. I think it was a very natural        Monetary Fund, a good deal of experience with developing countries, so&#13;
&#13;
        organic development for the Bank and, indeed, for the thinking about            when he came over to the Bank he brought that sort of broad-gauge&#13;
&#13;
        development in what we might call more broadly the development                  background.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           OLIVER:     Let me ask you, before I ask a bit more about economics, if     anticipation, if the country doing the borrowing would promise the Bank&#13;
&#13;
           you would say a word about a development institution as distinct from a     that it would carry out certain policies of a monetary and fiscal&#13;
           development finance organization. I think you make the point that the       policy nature.     I think it was discussed in the Bank in the '60s and&#13;
&#13;
           Bank began as a bank and a finance institution, but, by something like      was never agreed to. The reason I ask the question is that it is very&#13;
&#13;
           1970, it had become a development institution.    Is this more than         similar to the idea behind Structural Adjustment Loans which are much&#13;
&#13;
           giving economic advice to member governments?                               more highly regarded nowadays than they might have been in the Bank in&#13;
&#13;
           KNAPP:    Well, of course, first of all, it's designing our own long-       the '60s.&#13;
&#13;
           range loan strategy, globally but particularly in countries.    We          KNAPP;    Well, to be honest with you I don't remember much about that.&#13;
&#13;
           already in those days began to think about country-lending programs and     OLIVER:     I'm basically still trying to get at the issue of the&#13;
&#13;
           the interrelation of the different sectors and the different projects       relations between the general economics work, on the one hand, and the&#13;
&#13;
           that we were financing in a country.    Our country-lending strategies as   operations or loan work, on the other hand.     I think there was a time&#13;
&#13;
           plans of action came to be related to country-development programs, and     in the '60s when Irving Friedman sought to have the economic advisors&#13;
&#13;
       our financial operations and our advisory functions were related to             and indeed even the country economists in the various area departments&#13;
&#13;
       these country-development programs.        The advisory functions came to be    report in some sense to him as The Economic Advisor to the President,&#13;
&#13;
       more and more important, and the country economic reports of the Bank           and this was resisted by most of the economists in the area departments&#13;
&#13;
       came to contain more and more, you might say, commentary and                    of the Bank.     This was happening at the same time that the work in the&#13;
&#13;
       recommendations as distinct from descriptive materials.        Country          Economics Committee was being expanded somewhat.    Was there to your&#13;
&#13;
       economic reports became, and the dialogue on those economic reports             recollection a conflict of sorts going on in the Bank about the kind of&#13;
&#13;
       which we held with member countries before they were eventually issued          economics work that should be done or about how it should be managed or&#13;
&#13;
       came to be, a very important part of the Bank's total relationship with         whether it should be expanded so as to become more concerned with&#13;
&#13;
       its borrowers.                                                                  macroeconomic issues?&#13;
&#13;
       OLIVER:        Do you recall a Supplementary Finance Scheme which was born      KNAPP:    I don't remember the details of this very well, but I think&#13;
&#13;
       first in UNCTAD and then was studied within the Bank by the        economics    that the issues that arose at that time were not issues about the kind&#13;
&#13;
       staff?        This was a proposal to have the Bank guarantee to finance a       of economics work to be done but rather, let's just say, about&#13;
&#13;
       country's imports, even if its export earnings might fall short of              bureaucratic arrangements.     The country economics work had been&#13;
&amp;#12;...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                      9                                                                                  10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      decentralized to the regional departments when they were set up.        I          this respect quite a contrast with his predecessor.     Perhaps that is&#13;
&#13;
      think there was a feeling that the work of the Economics Department and            why one thinks of him as having sharper edges.     His predecessor, Gene&#13;
&#13;
      the role of the Economic Advisor was best discharged by general                    Black, was kind of a country gentleman.     His whole personality had very&#13;
&#13;
      discussions in the Economic Committee and in the framing of general                elegant, rounded features, so that the much more jagged, powerful mind&#13;
&#13;
      policy papers, leaving to the regional departments their own autonomy              that came forth from George Woods stood in some ways in very marked&#13;
&#13;
      in conducting country economic work.                                               contrast, which is interesting, because the two of them had been very&#13;
&#13;
      OLIVER:    Do you remember yourself attending meetings of the Economic             long associated and were great friends.&#13;
&#13;
      Committee in the '60s1    You don't mention it in your interview with Bob                 George could be severe with people to the point of being rough,&#13;
&#13;
      Asher, so that I get the impression that this was not a major operation            I would say.    Then again maybe it is all relative because of the&#13;
&#13;
      as least as far as loans were concerned.                                           contrasts.     Certainly when George first came in a lot of people around&#13;
&#13;
      KNAPP:    No, not as far as loans were concerned.    I don't think I               the place, including myself, had to make some adjustments to establish&#13;
&#13;
  attended any formal meetings of the Economic Committee.          All the               a good working relationship with him.     I never had any real trouble&#13;
&#13;
  members of the Economic Committee were well known to me.          As a matter          about that.     I can tell you that over the years that George was there,&#13;
&#13;
  of fact, most of the members of the Economic Committee were officers of                and after he left, people would come up to me and say, "Gee Burke, you&#13;
&#13;
  the regional departments under my supervision.          In a sense, I was their        must have had a pretty rough time working under George in those years.&#13;
&#13;
  line commander with Irving Friedman and his Economic Committee in a                    How was it1"    Well, I never felt it was that tough.&#13;
&#13;
  staff capacity.                                                                              We knew each other from before the time that George became&#13;
&#13;
  OLIVER:        I, myself, have never had the opportunity of meeting George             President, mostly in connection with those things which he was involved&#13;
&#13;
  Woods, so I am getting to know about him only through others.            I would       in that involved the Bank, such as the Suez Canal crisis snd the&#13;
&#13;
  appreciate your saying what you care to about George Woods as a person                 building of development finance companies in India snd elsewhere.&#13;
&#13;
  and also his manner of managing the Bank.                                              remember working with George on the Kaiser venture in an aluminum&#13;
&#13;
  KNAPP:        Well, George was a pretty extraordinary person.   He was very            smelter in Ghana.     Anyway, I knew George before he came in, and that&#13;
&#13;
  intelligent and very clear in his mind about his objectives.            His opinions   was a great help to our relationship.     George immediately made clear to&#13;
&#13;
  were held very strongly-- he wasn't the kind of fellow to be put                       me thst he wanted to see me continue in my work.     We would set up&#13;
&#13;
  off by arguments that didn't coincide with his own views.          He was in           patterns of consultation.     I carne to know pretty soon how much he&#13;
&amp;#12;'Â·.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                  11                                                                          12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  wanted to be brought into things, and how much he would expect me to         likely to be a very congenial one.     The members of the Board are there&#13;
&#13;
  carry out on my own authority.                                               to establish the policies of the institution and all that, but they&#13;
&#13;
             We had our differences from time to time, and he didn't always    also have their own axes to grind, and it is the very business of the&#13;
&#13;
  accept my recommendations to him on actions to be taken, but I always        President to resist these self-serving interests of the Board and to&#13;
&#13;
  thought I got a fair hearing on those things.     I would say our            keep his eye on the overall good of the membership.     The President is&#13;
  relationships were never as easy as they had been with Gene Black, but       likely to be chivvied, if I may use that expression, by the Executive&#13;
&#13;
  I always remained very happy in my work feeling that I had a boss who        Directors from time to time to suit their own national interests,&#13;
&#13;
  understood what we were trying to do together.     Still it is very          George's reaction to that generally was, "God damn it, I'm not going to&#13;
&#13;
  interesting how many people have said, "Oh gosh what a terrible time         be chivvied around by these Directors."     He wasn't accustomed to that&#13;
&#13;
  you must have gone through,"     Of course that reflects the fact that the   in his private-sector experience, and he wasn't going to accept it&#13;
&#13;
  other's relations with George had not been as satisfactory or                from the Board of Directors, for many of whom he didn't have that much&#13;
&#13;
  satisfying.                                                                  respect in terms of their intellectual capabilities.     So it's probably&#13;
&#13;
  OLIVER:    I have been told that in the second half of the Woods years,      true that things deteriorated,&#13;
&#13;
  '66 and '67, his relations with the Board became somewhat more               OLIVER:     I believe you mentioned in passing a project in Ghana&#13;
&#13;
  difficult.    I don't know if that is true because of the IDA                involving Kaiser Aluminum.     Since I've not heard about this, would you&#13;
&#13;
  replenishment problema, or whether the amount of loans being submitted       briefly tell me about it1&#13;
&#13;
  to the Board was larger, or whether there were genuine personality           KNAPP:     Well, this was one of the great African projects of the day --&#13;
&#13;
  differences between W~ods and some of the Board members. Let me just         to build a damn on the Volta River in Ghana to supply electric power&#13;
&#13;
  ask you if you think it was in general true7                                 not only to Ghana but to neighboring countries,     It was too massive,&#13;
&#13;
  KNAPP:    I can't really say.   I mean when you ask me the difference        too large scale a project, to find its economic justification unless&#13;
&#13;
  between the earlier years and the later years and whether there was a        some very large consumer of electricity could be brought in to consume&#13;
&#13;
  deterioration, I'm not sure.     I would guess that that would be true.      an important part of the production.     Jack Kennedy got into the act&#13;
&#13;
 There is always a kind of honeymoon period when the new president comes       himself.    He talked to various aluminum companies.   It ended up with&#13;
&#13;
  in and the Board wants to get to know him better, but the relationship       the Kaisers, who were persuaded to locate an aluminum plant in Ghana to&#13;
&#13;
  in the World Bank between the Board and the President is not ever            make this project feasible.     I personally handled the negotiations for&#13;
&amp;#12;â&#128;¢'â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                      13                                                                          14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      this project.     Edgar Kaiser was the president of   the whole range of     creation of what we called at the time the Development Finance&#13;
&#13;
      Ksiser industries, and handled a lot of the discussions on that side.        Companies. The classic case was the creation and fostering     of the&#13;
      George Woods was there as the financial advisor to Edgar Kaiser.             ICICI in India, which was a private company assisted by some government&#13;
&#13;
      OLIVER:    This would have been what year?   It was before George Woods      money on very generous terms but left to operate autonomously in using&#13;
      was President.                                                               both their rupee resources, which they got mainly from the government&#13;
      KNAPP      Yes, that's right.   Just in the year or two before he was        and their own private shareholders, and foreign-exchange resources,&#13;
      President.    The World Bank was asked to finance the dam and the power      which were provided as loans from the World Bank, deploying these&#13;
&#13;
      plant, and we wanted to see a satisfactory contract signed between the       resources in financing industrial development in India.     George spent a&#13;
      Ghana government and the Kaiser aluminum interests to produce revenues       lot of time in helping to set up this institution, helping to recruit&#13;
  which would be adequate to repay the loan.         There was a three-way         the board of directors and the management in India and guiding its&#13;
&#13;
      negotiation between the Ghana government, the World Bank, and the            early years.&#13;
  Kaiser Company.                                                                  OLIVER:   Did you have a feeling that, when he became President of the&#13;
&#13;
      OLIVER:    I wonder if you would also say a word about any of the other      Bank, he was particularly interested in India as a member country?&#13;
&#13;
  Woods' involvements with the Bank before he became President?                    KNAPP:    I can't recall any particular support for that, but he always&#13;
&#13;
  KNAPP:        Well, the things that I remember in particular I think             retained very close contact with Indian friends, and India was one of&#13;
&#13;
  mentioned earlier.         One was the involvement in the Suez Canal             the very large members of the Bank, so I'm sure he gave it a lot of&#13;
&#13;
  negotiations, with which I was not personally associated,         He was along   attention.&#13;
&#13;
  with General Wheeler.         I guess the two of them in particular, with Sir    OLIVER:   One of the major events of the Woods years in the Bank was the&#13;
&#13;
  William Iliff, who was another Vice President of the Bank, guided the            Bell Mission to India, headed by Bernie Bell, which produced a 14&#13;
&#13;
  discussions.         They were concerned with the negotiation of a payment of    volume report.    I have two questions to ask about that.   Was this Bell&#13;
&#13;
  compensation by Egypt to the previous private owners of the Suez Canal           Mission sort of a beginning of what later became country evaluation&#13;
&#13;
  in order to clear the path for the restoration of Egypt's credit in the          studies and were particularly important in the McNamara years'/     Was it&#13;
&#13;
  World Bank,                                                                      a precursor of that sort of thing?    That's the first question.    The&#13;
&#13;
              The thing that I am more familiar with, because it touched me        other:    would you comment about the fuss that was raised in India, which&#13;
&#13;
  more personally, was the work that George did in connection with the             rubbed off to some extent on George Woods as a person, as a consequence&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                               15                                                                             16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
of the Bell Report?                                                            particularly objectionable initially to the Indian government or the&#13;
&#13;
KNAPP:    Yes, I think it was a precursor of the more analytical and far-      Reserve Hank or the monetary authorities. They probably had their own&#13;
reaching studies which the Bank came to do of its member countries.       In   sensitivities about it, but it was seized on by some of the press.        The&#13;
&#13;
the early years of the Bank, of course, we did a lot of country studies        Indian press is a very free press, and some of the press began to seize&#13;
&#13;
-- in fact some of the them were published as books in the early days.         upon this as an infringement on national sovereignty.     I remember there&#13;
OLIVER:    Many of which I have,                                               were some pretty big words used about what a serious insult this was to&#13;
&#13;
KNAPP:    But they were very largely descriptive,   They were designed         the dignity of a nation.     You must remember that India is a pretty&#13;
&#13;
first of all to inform the Bank, but also to inform the private banking        massive nation and has its own traditions and ways of thinking.&#13;
&#13;
and industrial and commercial fraternity and the world at large about                    Yes, there was some trouble aver the report, and Bell himself&#13;
&#13;
the economic character, resources and management of many countries             was criticized roundly by some of what we might call the nationalist&#13;
&#13;
which at that time were pretty far out on the periphery of the vision          press-- the ultra nationalists press, and once this had happened and&#13;
&#13;
of the people in the western world.     These early books, as I say, were      pressure was brought on to the government, they got a little stiff&#13;
&#13;
very largely descriptive.    The Bell Mission report was of a far more         necked about it too.     But, as I look back upon it, I rather feel: Yes,&#13;
&#13;
analytical character and ventured far more in the way of judgments and         this kind of report was a precursor for other reports for other&#13;
&#13;
recommendations than the earlier country studies.     In that sense, it        countries that were subsequently done by the Bank, and that experience&#13;
&#13;
was a precursor of the economic work that came later.                             a debate or controversy between the Bank and the country concerned&#13;
&#13;
      On the question of the controversy that this report brought out             was also a precursor for that kind of thing elsewhere: it was,&#13;
&#13;
in India, WÂ¥ recollection is that the controversy was over some of the         perhaps, an example where the Bank's frankness in expressing views got&#13;
&#13;
recommendations, either implicit or explicit in the report, that dealt         a test.    Yes, this aroused a controversy, but it also meant that&#13;
&#13;
with sensitive matters of Indian policy, the most sensitive of which           countries got to be a little more used to that kind of thing.        It was,&#13;
&#13;
was the value of the currency.     The report, as I recall it, did not         after all, rather a storm in a teacup, and it did not discourage the&#13;
&#13;
recommend devaluation, but I think it clearly hinted that a downward           Bank from being frank in its exposition of problems or even in&#13;
&#13;
adjustment in the value of the currency was one of the solutions to the        suggesting solutions.     I think we had to go through that phase of&#13;
&#13;
problems that had developed in India.     It is my recollection (I'm           it, a testing time.     We had to learn, perhaps, how to get these&#13;
&#13;
not sure how far this can be relied upon) that this was not                    messages across in a way that would not raise such opposition as to&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 17                                                                               18&#13;

&#13;
while there were a lot of assets for them in the Bank, they had to            policy that leads to inflation while trying to maintain anything&#13;
&#13;
accept some obligations too.                                                 approaching fixed-exchange rates presents very substantial macro-&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Was this part and parcel of the Bank's evolving into a           economic problems.     I don't see how the Bank can talk about development&#13;
&#13;
development institution1                                                     without dealing with these issues, and yet it sounds to me like it's&#13;
&#13;
KNAPP:     Yes, exactly.                                                     more a Fund analysis kind of thing than a Bank analysis kind of thing,&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     By the time there were country review committee discussions      Let me ask my question in another way.       It appears to me that the&#13;
&#13;
about the economics of individual countries, was it relatively common        project approach of the Bank from the beginning implied that the Bank&#13;
&#13;
for the Bank to talk about things like exchange rates1                       is more concerned with what we now talk about as micro-economic&#13;
&#13;
KNAPP:     No, not publicly. I might have commented on that before.    The   analysis than macro-economic analysis.       On the other hand, it is&#13;
&#13;
exchange rate was a particularly sensitive matter in two senses. First       natural that the Fund would be more concerned with macro-economics than&#13;
&#13;
of all, just to deal with a bureaucratic one, it was very much the           with micro economics.    Am I pushing things a bit1&#13;
&#13;
province of the Monetary Fund to make judgments about exchange rates.        KNAPP:    Well, no, I think that is true.     The   ~und   has its own    micro&#13;
&#13;
Even today, after all the expansion of the economic and financial work       interests in, let's say, the administration of exchange controls,&#13;
&#13;
and analysis both in the Fund and the Bank, even today the Bank accords      multiple exchange rates, or what not.       There are techniques that are&#13;
&#13;
to the Fund the prime voice in making judgments about exchange rates.        very particularly in the Fund's bailiwick.      The Bank, of course, in irs&#13;
&#13;
So   the Bank would be reaching a little beyond its proper jurisdiction,     role as a bank for projects is doing a lot of micro analysis.             But it&#13;
&#13;
perhaps, to address such a subject.                                          got into macro analysis from the beginning in studying and appraising&#13;
&#13;
         The second respect in which this was a very sensitive issue is      and making judgments on country creditworthiness.          l'here couldn't be&#13;
&#13;
that fortunes are made in the markets on changes in exchange rates, and      anything more macro than that -- looking at a country in the round and&#13;
&#13;
speculation in the exchange markets can do grave damage to underlying        at its capacity to service its debt.&#13;
&#13;
economic activities.       So there is no doubt that devaluation was a far   OLIVER:    I want to ask a final series of questions if you have time.&#13;
&#13;
more sensitive issue than almost any other that you could have picked.       KNAPP:    Sure.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     I would have thought that that would have implied that the       OLIVER:   We were talking about country review work and also about&#13;

      in that job?                                                                 important part of country reviews.    As you know, the Bank contribution&#13;
&#13;
      KNAPP:     Hollis Chenery certainly became a very important part of          to finance a project is always some fraction of the total cost.&#13;
                                                                                                                              I&#13;
      the country review procedures.      The procedures were instituted under     Without making too much of it, the cut-off point for the Bank normally&#13;
&#13;
      the McNamara regime, and Irving Friedman, as the chief economist in the      would be the foreign-exchange cost, and it would be expected, especially&#13;
&#13;
      first years of that regime, must have participated in the country            from the countries borrowing from the Bank as distinct from IDA, that&#13;
&#13;
      reviews.     Over the long span of years, I certainly think of Hollis        the country concerned would mobilize its own local-current resources.           So,&#13;
&#13;
      as taking a very prominent part in the country reviews.      The country     yes, countries' monetary and fiscal policies procedures and results were&#13;
&#13;
      reviews were conducted by McNamara with respect to major countries, so       very important to country reviews.&#13;
&#13;
      to speak, and under my chairmanship with respect to the minor                OLIVER:    Asking you to look into your crystal ball if you will for a&#13;
&#13;
      countries.     This was simply because we conducted these reviews in the     moment, would you guess that the apparent new emphasis on debt&#13;
&#13;
  later years for 80 to 90 countries, and it was a little too much to put          restructuring and on Sector and Structural Adjustment Loans will move&#13;
&#13;
      on the plate of the President personally to participate in every one of      the Bank in the future somewhat farther away from strictly project&#13;
&#13;
      them.                                                                        lending as distinct from program lending?&#13;
&#13;
  OLIVER:         I asked the question about the presence of the chief economist   KNAPP:    Well, I am a conservative in this area.    Over time. the Bank&#13;
&#13;
      on these review committees partly again to ask the question about macro      has been urged to move more and mOTe into the area of program lending,&#13;
&#13;
      economics.     Did questions about monetary policy and fiscal policy not     macro-economic lending, or sector lending with quick disbursements and&#13;
&#13;
      only relate to creditworthiness but also to advice the Bank might give       without much in the way of conditions as to how the money is spent, the&#13;
&#13;
      these countries as a result of the country reviews becoming                  conditionality being more of a macro-economic or sector     kind~   That's an&#13;
&#13;
      increasingly prominent in the '70s?                                          instrument which can indeed be used effectively in certain situations.&#13;
&#13;
      KNAPP:     Oh yes, very much so.   Bear in mind that one of the very         There is a temptation -- I think a dangerous temptation        to say that&#13;
&#13;
      important issues in a country lending program is how much can be             the quick disbursement feature of such loans is what is needed in these&#13;
&#13;
      mobilized in domestic resources in the country concerned -- which takes      days of balance-of-payments difficulties in many developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
  you straight into fiscal policy.         Where budgets are being financed by     Countries that are heavily ridden by debt welcome quick disbursement as&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                              21                                                                               22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
a way of obtaining funds to service their external debts.     I think the   terms of the expansion of production and exports.         It is also clearly&#13;
&#13;
instrument is important and useful, but there are dangers about it.         true that project financing alone within a macro-economic policy&#13;
&#13;
      There is a danger of the Bank being manipulated into a position       framework that is distorted and misdirected won't do the job.            You have&#13;
&#13;
where it disburses funds against promises of macro-economic                 to do both.       Therefore. I like to see the Bank have both instruments,&#13;
&#13;
performance which are easy to give but hard to live up to.    Borrowing     but      am under the impression that some    people are pushing the Bank&#13;
&#13;
countries may over promise in order to get the very attractive feature      too far to minimize the project approach and to cast too much of its&#13;
&#13;
of a quick disbursement loan.    Another way of putting it is that I        support in this other direction.&#13;
&#13;
don't want to see the Bank get into a position of trying to bribe           OLIVER:    Long run growÂ·h requires sound micro and macro policy&#13;
&#13;
people through quick disbursment loans to moderate and adjust their         simultaneously -- something that we need to realize in the United&#13;
&#13;
macro-economic policies.   Not only would that be wrong in principle,       States.    In commenting on the country studies in your interview with&#13;
&#13;
but it wouldn't have lasting effects.   Unless countries are really         Bob Asher. I believe you suggested that the financial requirements of&#13;
&#13;
convinced through their dialogue with the Bank and the Monetary Fund of     the institutions over a period of years will be defined by the&#13;
&#13;
the need for a basic revision in their underlying macro-economic            aggregate of the country programs.&#13;
&#13;
policies, the effect will only be transitory, and it will not in            KNAPP:    The financial requirements for financing the Bank'l&#13;
&#13;
particular produce the means of repayment for these loans.    My own        OLIVER:    Yes,    And it is my understanding that this is the way the&#13;
&#13;
experience in the Bank gives me an institutional bias toward what I         Bank's suggestion for the Second I!JA     Rep~enishment   came about,     'rhe&#13;
&#13;
know to have been the principal metier of the Bank, which is project        question was asked how much each country could usefully use per year&#13;
&#13;
financing.                                                                  for the foreseeable future, and that number provided a basis for I!JA.&#13;
&#13;
      The second major problem about overexpanding in the area of           think the number turned out to be $4 billion, half of which it was&#13;
&#13;
program and adjustment loans is that the importance of the basic            thought would come from bilateral aid and half of the rest would&#13;
&#13;
project financing comes to be under appreciated,   The fact is that, in     conceivably come from IDA.       I'm wondering if this is your recollection&#13;
&#13;
the long run, developing countries, especially those that are heavily       as to how the billion dollar per year number first got on the plate to&#13;
&#13;
indebted, can find their salvation only in expanding production,            be talked about in the case of the Second IDA Replenishment.            That is a&#13;
&#13;
in finding ways to invest money productively in whatever type of            general lead-in to invite you to say what you care to about the Second&#13;
&#13;
project is required for producing real growth, yielding real fruits in      IDA Replenishment, which I think was a difticult one.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  23                                                                            '1.4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KNAPP:     You're certainly right, it was a difficult one.     I remember        equitably and productively distributed among country lending programs'/&#13;
&#13;
this because I was the chairman of the meeting for that particular               Of course there were questions of country creditworthiness, which i.s&#13;
&#13;
replenishment and had first of all to carry through the argument for             the limiting factor.   When it comes to overall estimates of needs, I&#13;
&#13;
the scale of the replenishment and, secondly, had to work out some               always felt that a lot of these figures were rationalizations that&#13;
&#13;
solution for the position taken by the United States, which was that             people felt might be politically acceptable or practicable.     In fact&#13;
&#13;
they were at that time in such serious balance-of-payments difficulties          what you did, just to be cynical about it, you rationalized a figure&#13;
&#13;
that any contribution that they made should be tied to the procurement           which was double what you thought you could get and came down from&#13;
&#13;
of US exports.                                                                   there.&#13;
&#13;
          On the matter of the scale of the contribution, I really don't                  What I have more usefully to say is that we had a very&#13;
&#13;
think I can help you very much,       Perhaps it is because I, myself, have      interesting problem in the Second IDA Replenishment of how to give the&#13;
&#13;
always had a skeptical attitude about the numbers which people came up           US assurance that, at least in the early years, their money would only&#13;
&#13;
with -- especially with numbers with respect&amp; to "needs" in heavy                be used to pay for US exports.   We persuaded the other contributors, or&#13;
&#13;
quotation marks.     One could indeed estimate what might be    forthcoming      whom there were perhaps at that time something like fifteen, to permit&#13;
&#13;
from bilateral or other sources, but, when it came to the aggregates,            calls on their contributions to be accelerated.     If procurement in the&#13;
&#13;
much of the numerology of these estimates of "needs" escaped me,        So   I   US was insufficient to use up the US share in the early years, the&#13;
&#13;
can't help you much there,                                                       other partners agreed that they would put up their money on an&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    May I interrupt to ask:    We were talking earlier about the          accelerated basis and to let the burden fall on the US only in the&#13;
&#13;
country requirements that developed from the five-year planning in the           later years of the disbursement of the funds.     Bear in mind that&#13;
&#13;
McNamara years.    May I infer that you put a good deal more credence in         the commitment period for an IDA replenishment is three years -- until&#13;
&#13;
those numbers?                                                                   the next replenishment, but the disbursement period runs out for 8,&#13;
&#13;
KNAPP:    No, wait a minute now.     I'm expressing general skepticism with      10, 12 years.   It was a bargain for the US to say, "We'll put up x&#13;
&#13;
respect to the feasibility of estimating over-all external capital               percent of the money (I guess it was 40 percent of the money at that&#13;
&#13;
needs.    A much more meaningful and useful discussion which was                 time), but if the actual US procurement is only 20 or 25 percent during&#13;
&#13;
conducted during these country review procedures was, given the                  the initial years, we'll put up only 20 or 25 percent of the actual&#13;
&#13;
resources available to the Bank and to IDA, how could they be most               funds required during that period, making up the balance at the end of&#13;
&amp;#12;;;Â·-.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                     25                                                                               26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   the line.     This meant that the US, although purportedly putting up 40       criteria, we would conceive some ideal distribution of global&#13;
&#13;
   percent of the contributions, was actually putting up, in terms of the         assistance to a particular country, look at what the bilateral sources&#13;
&#13;
   present value of the sums, not much more than, say, 30 percent of the          were doing them, and then fill in the balance.      1~at   is   ~   an&#13;
&#13;
   effective contributions.                                                       alternative to the other calculation.      It would start with the other&#13;
&#13;
   OLIVER:     Unless the value of the dollar was rising.                         calculation and adjust our IDA contribution to that of the bilateral&#13;
&#13;
   KNAPP:     Yes, that's right.                                                  lenders.     That was never a starter.   One of the first reasons it was&#13;
&#13;
  OLIVER:      Well, one last question about IDA replenishments.    You talk in   never a starter is that the bilateral lenders (the French wanted to&#13;
&#13;
   your conversation with Bob Asher about the various factors that were           help the French countries, the British wanted to help the British&#13;
&#13;
   taken into account in determining how IDA funds might be divided               Commonwealth countries, the U. S. wanted to help whoever was their&#13;
&#13;
   amongst the possible recipients.     I believe size of the population,         favorite country at the time) didn't want to see their efforts, so to&#13;
&#13;
   per-capita income, the degree of poverty, the performance of the               speak, frustrated by having IDA adjust its program to what they were&#13;
&#13;
   country, some favoring of smaller as opposed to larger countries, and,         doing.     We finally said we'll have to set the bilateral program aside&#13;
&#13;
  finally, filling the gaps that might be left after bilateral aid had            and tailor our IDA allocations on the merits of the recipient&#13;
&#13;
   been given.     In that listing, I think you don't attempt any                 countries,     We'll deal with them the way we think would be the most&#13;
&#13;
  quantification, so I can't tell which of these are terribly important           rational way, the most fair and equitable way, bearing in mind the&#13;
&#13;
  and which are of lesser importance.      Can you add anything to that list1     factors such as those that you've listed,&#13;
&#13;
  KNAPP:     Well, I would add, certainly, to that list the availability of       OLIVER;     I take it that it would be very hard to find in the Bank an&#13;
&#13;
  opportunities to invest money productively.      Some countries were never      equation which one could use as a program for a computer out of which&#13;
&#13;
  able, so to speak, to utilize the help they might have been eligible to         would come the exact amount that each country should receive for its&#13;
&#13;
   receive from IDA because they couldn't present effective projects or           IDA assistance.&#13;
&#13;
   programs to utilize those sums.                                                KNAPP:     That's right.   We always had theoreticians who would come up&#13;
&#13;
            I wouldn't try to rank the' others in importance but would say        giving weights to these different considerations and then grinding           out&#13;
&#13;
   that, in a sense, the idea of filling in the gaps in bilateral programs        (it wouldn't take a computer to do it, you could do it on an average&#13;
&#13;
   is an alternative to all the rest, and we abandoned that.        I think we    calculator) formulae which would give you the IDA allocations.           But we&#13;
&#13;
   had to abandon that.     It rested on the theory that, on the other            usually ended up with something more judgmental and more, I would say,&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                               27                                                                             28&#13;

&#13;
adjusted to the real world, and giving a little consideration in the            pitifully inadequate management tools in those areas, he just couldn't&#13;
end to haw much the country was benefiting from other sources.                  get over it.   He very promptly instituted a series of statistical&#13;
OLIVER:    There is in the George Woods collection in the Columbia              procedures -- first statistical data and then statistical&#13;
University Library under lock and key so that it can only be seen with          manipulations of those data -- which came in the end   almost to appall me.&#13;
the approval of the Archivist of the World Bank a long series of tables         He was a statistical genius, of course, but numbers would take on a&#13;
from about 1967, a table for each member country showing at least two           life of their own in his mind, numbers which were often of very doubtful&#13;
pages of statistics starting with gross national product and going              accuracy; they were numbers that were sometimes produced for an&#13;
through many, many other statistical facts, some of which eventually            occasion in the absence of any other numbers, and nobody could&#13;
appeared in the   ~     Tables that the World Bank began to publish             effectively challenge them.   But I must say that&#13;
shortly after that.    With each one of these there is an appraisal by a        the statistical data that were available during the Woods regime&#13;
country economist which simply says, "Yes, I think that this country is         and came to be regarded in McNamara's day as incredibly primitive.&#13;
a good bet for IDA funding," or "No, I think the creditworthiness of            OLIVER:   Well, I've kept you a very long time this .afternoon. I think&#13;
this country is in doubt," or "the political situation is difficult."           it's time to call a halt to this discussion.   I surely want to thank&#13;
I'm wondering whether these papers, which seem to be quite confidential,        you for this marvelous opportunity.&#13;
(at least in the eyes of the Columbia University Librarian) are the&#13;
&#13;
beginning of the sort of thing that we're now talking about.        Would you&#13;
&#13;
r;uess?&#13;
&#13;
KNAPP:    Well, probably.   I don't know exactly what these papers are,&#13;
&#13;
but probably.    But that does prompt me to make the comment that when&#13;
&#13;
McNamara came into the Bank, he was appalled-- I couldn't overstate it&#13;
&#13;
-- he was appalled at the lack of statistical data available to the&#13;
&#13;
Bank with respect to its countries, with respect to its own operations&#13;
&#13;
in these countries, and with respect to the activities of other donors&#13;
&#13;
in these countries.    When I in my early days of association with&#13;
&#13;
McNamara showed him what, in retrospect, can only be regarded as&#13;
