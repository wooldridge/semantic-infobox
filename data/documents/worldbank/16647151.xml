Peru has benefitted from macroeconomic stability and growth&#13;
in the last few years. At the same time, it also presents&#13;
important contradictions in terms of unresolved access to                    â&#128;¢	 Public infrastructure investments in water&#13;
basic sanitation. This is characterized by a) an on-going                       and sanitation need complementary&#13;
gap that reflects the high levels of inequity between rural                     strategies for assuring families access to&#13;
and urban coverage, b) unused services and low levels                           affordable products and services, healthy&#13;
of customer satisfaction with current sanitation solutions,                     behaviors, and adequate maintenance&#13;
and c) unsustainable and inefficient public investments.                        of new sanitary infrastructure. The link of&#13;
                                                                                infrastructure programs with sanitation&#13;
During the 1990s, the Peruvian Government allocated                             markets has the potential to contribute to&#13;
US$ 833 million to the water and sanitation sector, representing                improved policies aimed at achieving real&#13;
an important increase over previous decades. Only 15 percent                    impacts on poor peopleâ&#128;&#153;s lives.&#13;

Likewise, in the last four years (2006 to 2010) the&#13;

  segment also requires significant investments in training,              sanitation demand that requires activation of behavior&#13;
  regarding how to operate those financial mechanisms. The                drivers to be transformed into real demand. Some of the key&#13;

  to prove the viability of market-based subsidies by offering            sanitation facilities; the possibility to fit the selected facility&#13;
  households opportunities to choose the toilet or bathroom they          to their preferences; the right to appeal against goods and&#13;

  lending model has a cross-guarantee system that allows                  in all its aspects. This is not necessarily about income&#13;
  households to improve sanitation access through the purchase            capacity; it is more about citizenship-building. An inclusive&#13;

            Domestic private sector participation in
            Peru : sanitation markets at the bottom of the pyramid - a
            win-win scenario for government, the private sector, and communities
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Peru has benefitted from macroeconomic
            stability and growth in the last few years. At the same
            time, it also presents important contradictions in terms of
            unresolved access to basic sanitation. This is characterized
            by: a) an on-going gap that reflects the high levels of
            inequity between rural and urban coverage, b) unused
            services and low levels of customer satisfaction with
            current sanitation solutions, and c) unsustainable and
            inefficient public investments.  Despite of the important
            infrastructure investments of the last 20 years, significant
            gaps remain, as well as the need to address quality and
            sustainable sanitation service. Moreover, it has not
            impacted the improvement of health and environment-related
            indicators. According to the National Statistics Institute,
            while national sanitation coverage has increased by 20
            percent (1993-2007), in the same period the percentage of
            prevalence of chronic malnutrition in children under five
            years old has decreased by 9 percent and that of diarrhea by
            only 5 percent.
