            Institutional investors, facing lower
            rates of return on investments in the mature power and
            telecommunications sectors of industrial countries, have
            been scouring emerging markets for higher returns.  To
            attract these institutional investors, a growing number of
            equity funds are giving them the opportunity to mitigate
            risk by investing in a portfolio of infrastructure entities
            in developing countries.  These funds will help to attract
            additional equity and debt capital flows to developing
            countries and may contribute to the development of local
            capital markets.  This Note discusses new methods for
            tapping international and local capital markets for
            long-term infrastructure funding, and it focuses in
            particular on the key characteristics of the equity
            funds--pooling risk and providing long-term capital to
            private entities.
