  AN EXAMPLE OF SUCCESSFUL SUPPORT TO THE RURAL PRIVATE SECTOR&#13;
&#13;
  An example of a successful intervention in stimulating private sector supply comes from Bangladesh, where a US-based NGO&#13;
  called International Development Enterprises (IDE) has supported private sector involvement in the supply of manual pumps&#13;
  for irrigation and domestic water supply. First, IDE carried out research and development to create new versions of three&#13;
  common pumps, making them cheaper, more robust and better suited to local needs. IDE then worked with manufacturers to&#13;
  improve quality, expand the production base and foster competition. The NGO helped to create demand among users by&#13;
  developing marketing tools for retailers and showcasing the improved pumps in various locations in the country. IDE created&#13;
  a network among dealers (mostly small hardware shops selling a range of products), provided training and helped ensure&#13;
  quality control. When the pumps came to the market, all of them were distributed through private sector retailers, without any&#13;
  direct subsidy to buyers.&#13;
  The result is that there are now sustained private sales of the pumps through a large number of small, independent enter-&#13;
  prises. In the case of one of the three pumps, a manual irrigation pump, 1.3 million have now been installed nationwide.&#13;
  Interestingly, IDEs experience is that its involvement has led to steady sales of higher quality versions of the irrigation pump,&#13;
  suggesting that improved quality is being provided at an acceptable price, and that product promotion is increasing aware-&#13;
  ness among buyers of the benefits of higher quality pumps.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
In developing countries, the formal              start-up, expansion and product diver-&#13;
banking sector is often of little use to         sification (though actual provision of&#13;
small enterprises as it charges high             financial services should be left to spe-&#13;

            The Supply Chains Initiative is a global
            initiative led by the Water and Sanitation Program.
            Collaborating partners include government departments, NGOs,
            and bilateral and multilateral agencies. The aim of this
            initiative is to develop practical tools that enable and
            encourage the private sector to provide goods and services
            related to rural water supply and sanitation. The
            initiative's first phase focused on increasing the
            understanding of the dynamics of the private sector supply
            chains for handpumps, spare parts, and sanitation equipment.
