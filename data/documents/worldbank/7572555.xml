Background&#13;
1. This memorandum summarizes the progress made under the Governance Structural&#13;
   Adjustment Credit (GSAC) to the Kyrgyz Republic. IDA approved the SDR 14.7 million&#13;
   (US$20 million equivalent) Credit on 15 May 2003. The credit agreement was signed on 28&#13;
   May 2003 and became effective on 30 July 2003. The credit was to be disbursed in three&#13;
   tranches o f SDR 3.675, 3.675 and 7.350 millions respectively.          The first tranche was&#13;
   disbursed on effectiveness o f the Credit on 30 July 2003. The second tranche was to be&#13;
   disbursed on completion o f a series of governance reforms described below. Although the&#13;
   second tranche was originally planned for disbursement in mid 2004, there were delays in&#13;
   meeting some o f the critical conditions, which were increased by unstable political conditions&#13;
   inthe Kyrgyz Republic following the fall o f the previous government inMarch2005.&#13;
&#13;
2. The GSAC supports the Government's program to strengthen the effectiveness o f the State&#13;
   and improve governance.          Its main objectives are: to improve the transparency and&#13;
   responsiveness o f the public sector and enhance the ability o f external stakeholders to hold it&#13;
   accountable and at the same time increase efficiency, effectiveness o f the public sector. To&#13;
   achieve these objectives, the GSAC is supporting reforms aimed at (i)improving personal&#13;
   accountability o f political officials and civil servants and enhancing the effectiveness of the&#13;
   civil service; (ii)improving service delivery in the health and education sectors; (iii)&#13;
   streamlining the structure o f Government ministries and agencies. (iv) strengthening voice&#13;
   and participation by improving public access to official information; (iv) improving the&#13;
   interaction between regulatory agencies and business enterprises; (v) strengthening public&#13;
   expenditure management (vi) improving transparency, value for money and accountability in&#13;
   public procurement.&#13;
&#13;
3. The reform program supported by the GSAC i s intended to increase the ability o f citizens,&#13;
   civil society and the private sector to demand improvements in State performance, and at the&#13;
   same time to strengthen core competencies, including particularly public expenditure&#13;
   management, within the public sector.        The reforms also provide a basis for gradually&#13;
   increasing the professionalism and capacity o f the civil service, and more widely to improve&#13;
   governance and reduce corruption in the Kyrgyz Republic, so as to enhance the ability o f the&#13;
   State to pursue the development and growth objectives o f the Country Development Strategy&#13;
   (CDS).&#13;
&#13;
4. The importance o f improved governance for economic development is a central theme of the&#13;
  draft CDS for 2007-2010 (the country's PRSP). The CDS identifies pervasive corruption, as&#13;
   one o f the key constraints to development in the past and a major cause o f the revolution o f&#13;
  March 2005. It recognizes that corruption and weak governance stem from state capture by&#13;
   interest groups, the absence o f effective checks and balances on executive power, and lack o f&#13;
  clearly defined responsibilities at the center o f government. It notes that corruption and weak&#13;
  governance hamper the business climate, particularly through excessive regulation, arbitrary&#13;
  and intrusive inspections, and a corrupt and inefficientjudiciary. Lastly, the CDS recognizes&#13;
  that improving governance requires a merit-based professional civil service as a stepping&#13;
  stone to forging transparency and efficiency in public administration. In this respect some&#13;
  solid advances have been made by the authorities in the last year, supported by the GSAC&#13;
  program, as discussed below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                  1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5. While reducing corruption in the Kyrgyz public sector will continue to require sustained,&#13;
   long-term efforts on many fronts, the reforms supported by GSAC are contributing to this&#13;
   objective in several ways. Some o f the reforms supported, such as publication o f declarations&#13;
   of incomes and assets and the introduction o f competitive appointments to the civil service,&#13;
   have a direct anti-corruption objective.       Others address the problem indirectly through&#13;
   systemic institutional reforms that increase transparency and accountability. For instance,&#13;
   increased awareness o f State activities and relevant rules and regulations enables external&#13;
   stakeholders to demand higherstandards of integrity from public officials. Similarly, reduced&#13;
   discretion and informality in budget execution resulting from modernization o f treasury&#13;
   operations; strengthening of internal control and external audit functions; and increased&#13;
   transparency inthe procurement process diminishes opportunities for fraud and corruption in&#13;
   public expenditure management. Finally, the elimination o f financing mechanisms (Special&#13;
   Means Accounts) that create perverse incentives for regulatory agencies to harass businesses&#13;
   in order to increase their funding, will both improve the business environment and the&#13;
   transparency and efficiency o f public resource management.&#13;
&#13;
6. Waivers are being requested on two conditions which were met partially. The first i s on&#13;
   condition 2, relating to the passage o f a new Civil Service Law satisfactory to IDA. As&#13;
   explained below a draft law satisfactory to IDA was submitted to the Jogorku Kenesh&#13;
   (parliament) in May 2004. The new law was a big improvement on the previous law as it&#13;
   clearly differentiated between political appointments and permanent administrative&#13;
   appointments, increased the competitiveness in recruitment and promotion o f civil servants,&#13;
   improved incentives for performance and integrity, improved institutional arrangements for&#13;
   the management o f the civil service through the creation o f the Civil Service Agency to&#13;
   manage personnel processes, required declaration o f income and assets o f civil servants and&#13;
   allowed for these to be made public on request, as required under the conditions for the&#13;
   release o f the second tranche o f the credit.&#13;
&#13;
7. The law was approved inJune 2004 but with amendments that weakened the independence of&#13;
   the Civil Service Agency and strengthened the relative powers o f ministers. These&#13;
   amendments to the original draft potentially reduced the independence o f the Civil Service&#13;
   Agency by specifying one year terms for the members o f the Civil Service Council&#13;
   overseeing the operation o f the Agency and deleted a provision in the functions o f the&#13;
   Agency which clearly ensured that it was to give its consent to personnel changes at the&#13;
   highest level o f the Civil Service. For these reasons the law was initially deemed&#13;
   unsatisfactory to IDA and changes were requested. Given these concerns on the amendments&#13;
   to the agreed draft o f the law, there was an extensive dialogue with the authorities that&#13;
   resulted in significant progress in implementing the law (particularly as regards merit based&#13;
   appointments, the responsibility o f the Civil Service Agency rather than Ministers for&#13;
  personnel matters). In the light o f the progress made in implementing the law it was&#13;
   recognized that changes by parliament to the law would be both difficult to achieve and add&#13;
   little value to its impact at this stage, given that the law as approved by parliament did&#13;
   comply substantively with that envisaged under the second tranche conditions.&#13;
&#13;
8. The second waiver is being requested on condition 8 regarding the development o f capitation&#13;
  based formulae for the allocation o f funds for health and education.       In both cases the&#13;
  formulae were developed. However, in the case o f education it was recognized by the Bank&#13;
  team that in the absence o f other reforms in the education sector the purpose o f achieving&#13;
  equity and efficiency would not be feasible, and so it has been agreed to delay this action&#13;
  until further progress has been made. The preconditions for the effectiveness of the&#13;
  categorical grants to fund education were that they should be assigned to levels o f authority&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    with the power to determine staff teacher ratios and numbers o f schools and that the grant&#13;
    finances inputs beyond salaries. Thus prior to the introduction of capitation based formulae&#13;
    for grants in education a clear re-definition of the responsibilities for the delivery o f&#13;
    education services will be required, together with the implementation o f decentralization of&#13;
    local finances, which is planned to take place with the approval of the 2007 budget. In the&#13;
&#13;
    transparent and objective geographic allocation of resources throughout the country - which&#13;
    case of health, the transfer o f health financing to the republican budget has facilitated a more&#13;
&#13;
    was the purpose of the capitation formula - and inthat sense can be taken as compliance with&#13;
    the spirit ofthe original conditionality.&#13;
&#13;
Macroeconomic framework&#13;
9. Macroeconomic policy implementation in recent years has been adequate and the authorities&#13;
    have establisheda good record o f implementation o f successive PRGF-supported programs&#13;
    since 2001. InFebruary 2005, the IMF approved a new 3-year PRGF arrangement to support&#13;
    the Kyrgyz Republic's economic program. The Board completed the third review under the&#13;
    arrangement in November 2006. Under the program, growth has been modest although&#13;
    volatile (averaging 4 percent annually over the last five years) as a result of fluctuations in&#13;
    gold production and political turbulence. A prudent fiscal policy has been maintained with&#13;
    the fiscal deficit gradually reduced to 3.1 percent of GDP in 2006. Inflation has also been&#13;
    contained and wasjust above five percent last year. While the Kyrgyz Republic was eligible&#13;
    for debt reduction under the HIPC program, the authorities chose not to participate, and the&#13;
    indications are that risingrevenues implythat the Kyrgyz Republic will not longer be eligible&#13;
    for debt reduction under the HIPC initiative. While the current account deficit has increased&#13;
    to 23.6 percent o f GDP, this is essentially due to difficulties in recording a substantial&#13;
    proportion o f remittances and re-exports o f shuttle traders and businesses in the informal&#13;
    economy (particularly in the textile sector where the tax regime was simplified in 2006).&#13;
    These incomes are reflected in errors and omissions in the balance o f payments which&#13;
    reached 20.8 percent o f GDP in 2006. Much o f the increase in imports i s the counterpart o f&#13;
    these flows, and thus the current account deficit does not represent a significant external&#13;
    financing problem.&#13;

Recent Developments in governance reforms&#13;
10. When the GSAC reform program began in 2003, it was initiated by a government which had&#13;
    officially recognized in its National Poverty Reduction Strategy that good governance and&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    reducingcorruptionwere keyto development and poverty reduction. In2003 and 2004 three&#13;
    institutions were established in the area of good governance' but these institutions suffered&#13;
    from overlapping and unclear mandates. Finally in 2005 the authorities established anti-&#13;
    corruptioncommissionwith a mandateto formulate policy inthe area of anti-corruption.&#13;
&#13;
11, Inmany areas reforms to the legal framework were adopted with the purpose of improving&#13;
    governance. For example, new laws and regulations to simplify licenses and reduce&#13;
    inspections were adopted. In2003, a law to decentralizefinancing to local governments was&#13;
    approved. In2004, laws to reform the Civil Service and to requirethe declarationof incomes&#13;
    and assets of high state officials were approved (see discussion below). Many technical&#13;
    reforms to the budget process to improve the transparency and efficiency o f the budget were&#13;
    also adopted.&#13;
&#13;
12. During this period a clear pattern emerged. Technical reform's (particularly in the area of&#13;
    public finance, and the health sector), although slow, were gradually adopted. On the other&#13;
    hand, wider governance reforms would often only be introduced into the legal framework or&#13;
    by the creation of a new institution with an unclear mandate. Capacity and willingness to&#13;
    follow through and ensure implementation of those wider reforms was low. Survey data&#13;
    indicated that governance was deteriorating and corruption intensifying. According to the&#13;
    2005 Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS), 59 percent of&#13;
    businesses cited corruption as a significant obstacle to doing business.*       This figure is the&#13;
    highest inthe regionand indicatesa worsening compared to the 2002 survey.&#13;
&#13;
13. The proliferation of new laws and institutions gave the impression of institutional&#13;
    development. However, behind the common failure to implement many laws and reforms,&#13;
    state institutions and the rule of law was weakening and endemic corruption was growing,&#13;
    particularly among the close associates of the Presidentandhisfamily. This ledto increasing&#13;
    popular discontentwith the regime for the failure of the state to deliver many basic services&#13;
    and at the clearly observable corruption which accompanied any interaction with state&#13;
    officials.&#13;
&#13;
14. The fraudulent parliamentary elections of February and March 2005 provided a catalyst for&#13;
    this discontent. As a result a non-violent "Tulip Revolution" occurred in March 2005 in&#13;
    which the previous President and Government were overthrown. These changes opened up&#13;
    possibilities for significant reforms, and the new authorities indicated their commitment to&#13;
    transparency and good governance. These intentions have been supported by some reform&#13;
    constituencieswithin the authorities on the one side, and pushed, from the other side, by a&#13;
    civil societythat has become muchmore active and demanding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1 The NationalCouncilonGoodGovernancewas createdby presidentialdecreeto be a "consultative-&#13;
advisory body to designand implementnew mechanismsthat ensure good, open andresponsible&#13;
governance aimedat implementinga nationalanti-corruptionpolicy". A subsequent decree createda&#13;
secretariat for the NCGG, althoughinpracticethe secretariat consistedof one unpaidofficial.Finallyin&#13;

Kyrgyzcitizens and 5 representativesofthe Internationalcommunity inKyrgyzstan, with the Presidentof&#13;

transferredto the CCGG.&#13;

&#13;
                                                                                                    4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15. The origins of the revolution meant that the rhetoric of the fight against corruption became&#13;
    one of the principal priorities of the new government. However the effect of the revolution&#13;
   was initially to fragment state power further. Since the revolution, continued political&#13;
   tensions within the government, and between the government and parliament have slowed&#13;
    progress, and at times threatenedto paralyzedecision-making. This sparkedanationaldebate&#13;
    on constitutionalarrangements and the relativepowers of the government, parliamentand the&#13;
   president, which resulted in mass demonstrations calling for redistributionof constitutional&#13;
   powers. As a result, the constitution underwent two major revisions during November and&#13;
   December 2006. While the original attempt of the revisionswas to reduce the powers of the&#13;
   president and introducemore checks and balances within executive, the final version of the&#13;
   Constitutionhas restored some of the president's powers. Neverthelessthe result has been&#13;
   that there are now more checks and balances within the state than existed prior to the&#13;
   revolution.&#13;
&#13;
16. Inearly February, 2007, following the resignationofthe first post revolutionary government,&#13;
   a new prime minister was appointed and accepted by Parliament, and a new government was&#13;
   formed. Nevertheless, the Government has repeated the commitments of the first post-&#13;
   revolutionarygovernment to improvinggovernance.&#13;
&#13;
ProgressinImplementingthe Reform Agenda&#13;
&#13;
17 As can be seen from the overview of recent developments progress in governance reforms&#13;
   was uneven and difficult. The governance reform agenda supported by GSAC covered a&#13;
   large number of areas which included: civil service reforms, transparency in income and&#13;
   assets of senior officials, reformof external audit and the chamber of accounts, public finance&#13;
   reformsto ensure a comprehensiveand transparent budgetaryprocess, and the eliminationof&#13;
   the funding of institutions through special means accounts, reforms to public procurement&#13;
   and reforms to the financing of health and education, so as to ensure an efficient use of&#13;
   resourcesand improve servicedelivery.&#13;
&#13;
18. Three of the reform areas (Civil Service, Declarationof Income and Assets, and Chamber of&#13;
   Accounts) required the development of significant legislation and implementation&#13;
   regulations. Itbecameclear that ownershipand understandingofthe reforms in each of these&#13;
   areas was weak. In the case of the civil service reform the principal idea was to remove the&#13;
   patronage of ministersand their appointees in designating civil servants, introducemerit and&#13;
   rule basedappointmentand promotion, ensure that professionalcivil servants have securityof&#13;
   tenure, and are not subject to dismissal following political changes. With respect to the&#13;
   Chamber of Accounts, the main idea was to reform the COA from being an organization&#13;
   concerned with exercising a control function and punishingviolations (and wide scope for&#13;
   rentseeking) to establisha modernexternalauditand accountabilityfunction.&#13;
&#13;
19. Progressindevelopingthe legalframework, for all three major legal initiatives(Law on Civil&#13;
   Service, Law on Declarationof Incomeand Assets, Law on the Chamber of Accounts) was&#13;
   therefore slow, and required constant debate during the first year following the approval of&#13;
   GSAC, as the applicationof the principlesenshrined inthe GSAC programinthese areas was&#13;
   hadnot beeninternalizedat the time that the GSAC programwas agreed.&#13;
&#13;
20. At the same time, the government made considerable progress in a number of reforms in&#13;
   public expenditure management under the GSAC. Budgetary functions were consolidated&#13;
   under the Economic Policy Council in 2004, an actionplanto bring all extra-budgetaryfunds&#13;
   under the Treasury was developed and implementedduring 2004, and regulations requiring&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   the replacement of special means funding for agencies that had regulatory responsibilities&#13;
   with direct budget finding were implementedfrom January 2005. Finally at the end of 2006,&#13;
   the Ministry of Finance developed and approved a new budget classificationbased on GFS&#13;
   2001standards, which provides a solidbasis for transparent and coherent budget formulation&#13;
   and execution.&#13;
&#13;
21. In addition, the government has made steady progress in improving other areas of Public&#13;
   Financial Management, including the introduction of the basic elements of the Medium&#13;
   Terms Budget Framework, improvement of comprehensiveness of the budget and its&#13;
   presentation (again all measures supported under the GSAC program). The Ministry of&#13;
   Finance elaborated and approved, on the basis of a PEFA assessment, a Public Finance&#13;
   ReformactionplanofJanuary 2006.&#13;
&#13;
22. In the area of healthfinancing reforms a Single Payer Law was enacted in 2003 which took&#13;
   away responsibility for healthfinancingfrom Rayon and Oblast financial departments to the&#13;
   Republic budget in 2005. The effect (together with other reforms in the health sector) has&#13;
   been to increase the proportion of resources dedicated to primary health care as well shift&#13;
   resources within the health sector from hospital financing to direct patient care from so that&#13;
   the latter increased as aproportionof total health spending from 16.4 percent in2000 to 36.6&#13;
   percent in2004.&#13;
&#13;
23. Thus progress, though slower than originally envisaged, was steady and visible. By May&#13;
   2004 the Governmenthad drafted acceptable versions of the Law on Chamber of Accounts,&#13;
   which in fact went further than the narrow conditionality of GSAC, the Law on Civil Service&#13;
   and the Law on the Declarationof Income and Assets. The three laws were approved by&#13;
   Parliament in June 2004. However, in the case of the Law on Civil Service, amendments&#13;
   were introducedwhich potentially weakened the independence of the Civil Service Agency.&#13;
   The Bank raised formal concerns that these amendments put at risk the independence of the&#13;
   new institutionsfor management ofthe Civil Service.&#13;
&#13;
24, At the same time the Governmentmoved ahead in establishingthe Civil Service Agency to&#13;
   manage and develop the required procedures for a rule based system of appointments and&#13;
   dismissals, a separation of politicalappointees from career civil servants, and inparticular the&#13;
   establishment of the position of State Secretaries to head the permanent civil service in all&#13;
   ministries.Thus substantialprogressat a technical and institutionallevel was beingmade.&#13;
&#13;
25. Shortly after the establishment of the Civil Service Agency, however, a close relative of&#13;
   President Akaev was appointed as State Secretary of the Civil Service Agency. The Bank&#13;
   team argued that this action demonstrated a lack of commitment and understandingof the&#13;
   reforms and was a clear breach of the overall program. This situation was only rectified&#13;
   followingthe Revolutionin March2005.&#13;
&#13;
26. Then, in the immediate aftermath of the revolutionthere was considerableturnover of posts&#13;
   and appointments outsidedue process. The Civil Service Agency did attemptto oppose these&#13;
   appointments, sometimes successfully, but both in the parliament and much of the&#13;
   Presidentialadministrationthere was active hostility to the Civil Service Reform, precisely&#13;
   because it had made it more difficult to make arbitrary appointments. Conflicts broke out&#13;
   between State Secretaries and ministers, as some State Secretaries tried to safeguard the&#13;
   institutionalintegrity oftheir ministries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27. The Bank emphasized the need for the highestauthoritiesto show full public support for the&#13;
   reform process and the insti tutions and leadership in stopping appointments outside due&#13;
   process in the civil service. To increase compliance with the Civil Service Law on the&#13;
   recommendation of the Bank team monitoring mechanism were put in place. When&#13;
   monitoring began at the end of 2005, at least half of appointmentswere being made outside&#13;
   o f due process. By the end of 2006, virtually all appointments were beingmadethrough due&#13;
   process. It was also clear that a culture was developing in which the new institutional&#13;
   arrangements were accepted by the authorities, and in which the Civil Service Agency was&#13;
   now able to exercise its authority to ensure due process inappointments and dismissals.&#13;
&#13;
28. Recognizingthat work supported by the GSAC credit is only the beginningof a process that&#13;
   will take decades to fully benefit the Kyrgyz Republic, it is the judgment of the team that&#13;
   despitethe imperfect legalframework, actual implementationof the reforms has been taking&#13;
   place, that there has been substantive compliance with the program and that although&#13;
   progresshadbeenslow, it is now sustainable.&#13;
&#13;
29. Significant progress was also made inthe implementationof the Law on the Declarationof&#13;
   Incomeand Assets ofHigh State officials (see below).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Progress Against Second TrancheReleaseCriteria&#13;
    Condition 1. A new law, satisfactory to the Association, on declaration and&#13;
    publicationof income and assets of highstate officials in the executive,judicial and&#13;
    legislative branches of the State, includingthe President, the Prime Minister, Vice&#13;
    Prime Ministers, ministers, deputy ministers, judges and members of the&#13;
    Parliament, and their close family members (spouse and dependent children,&#13;
    parents, brothersand sisters).&#13;
&#13;
30. The condition has been met. The law was adopted in August 2004. The law provides a&#13;
   comprehensive definition of close family members and the income and assets to be declared.&#13;
   Although approved 2004, it was not effectively implementeduntil early 2006. There was&#13;
   great reluctance to publish the declarations of parliamentary deputies and ministers. After&#13;
   severalmonths of dialogue, the principleof publicationwas accepted and since March2006,&#13;
   the declarations have been publishedin the mass media and the internet, and compliance in&#13;
   submittingdeclarationshas reachedat least 90 percentof eligibly officials. Since the law was&#13;
   approved, the Civil Service Agency, as the body responsible for its implementation, has&#13;
   successfullyconductedthree declarationcampaigns.&#13;
&#13;
    Condition2. Amendments, satisfactory to the Association, have been introducedto&#13;
    the Civil Service Law to: (i) differentiate political appointees and career civil&#13;
    servants, (ii)increasecompetitivenessin recruitmentand promotionof civilservants&#13;
    and reduce politicalinterferencein personnel management decisions, (iii)improve&#13;
    incentives for performance and integrity; (iv) improve institutionalarrangements&#13;
    for management of the civil service, (v) require declarationof income and assets of&#13;
    civil servants and their close family members (spouse and dependent children,&#13;
    parents, brothers and sisters), and (vi) make declarations of income and assets of&#13;
    civil servants available to the public on request, and declarations of income and&#13;
    assets of their closefamilymembersavailableto specifiedstate bodies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                             7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31. The condition has been partially (and substantively) met. A draft law satisfactoryto&#13;
    IDA was submitted to the Jogorku Kenesh (parliament) in May 2004. The agreed draft&#13;
    law was approved by parliament, but with amendmentswhich formal weakened the relative&#13;
    power of the Civil Service Agency, which was established under the new law, and&#13;
    strengtheningthe relative powers of ministers, For these reasons, the IDA team initially&#13;
    objectedto the changes. The new Law however, even with the amendments introducedby&#13;
    parliament,represented enormous progress compared with the previous situation. The law&#13;
    clearly distinguishes between political appointees and career civil servants, and improved&#13;
    incentives for performance and integrity. It improved institutional arrangements for the&#13;
    management of the Civil Service through the creation of a Civil Service Agency and&#13;
    empoweringit to manage the appointmentsprocess and to develop competitiveprocedures&#13;
    for appointments and promotions. It therefore ensures that civil service appointments are&#13;
    not simply the result of ministerialpatronage. It establishes the role of the State Secretary&#13;
    as the senior (permanent) civil servant in each ministry. The law also provides for civil&#13;
    servants to declare their income and assets and for these to be available to state bodies.In&#13;
    this respect the law compliedwith all of the criteria specifiedunder this condition, except,&#13;
    potentially, giving more scope than was desirable for political interference in personnel&#13;
    management.&#13;
&#13;
32. However, after the revolution, it was recognized that there was insufficient support for&#13;
    reversingthe amendments to the Law on the Civil Service, in the Jogorku Kenesh, partly&#13;
    due to a lack of full understandingof the reforms and partly because there was a widely&#13;
    held view that the creation of the Civil Service Agency was tarnished by their association&#13;
    with the previous regime. Thus the Bank team recognized that while reversing the&#13;
    amendments to the Civil Service Law continue to be desirable it was more importantthat&#13;
    there should beprogress in actually implementingthe mainprovisionsof the law.&#13;
&#13;
33. The Civil Service Law, as approved, embodies all the main principles described in the in&#13;
    the second tranche conditions and all the main provisions of the Civil Service Law are&#13;
    being implemented.Under the new institutionalarrangements the Civil Service Agency is&#13;
    responsible for ensuring the separationof political and administrative appointments. The&#13;
    Civil Service Agency has developed and implemented procedures for the competitive&#13;
    selection of Civil Servants up to the highest administrative level (State Secretary). It has&#13;
    also introducedproceduresto ensure transparent promotionon the basis of merit. Finally it&#13;
    has introduced and implemented procedures for the declaration of income and assets of&#13;
    civil servants. As of the end of 2006, compliancewith due process in the appointment of&#13;
    civil servants has improved significantly, and in December of 2006 there were no&#13;
    appointments made outside due process (compared with 30-40 percent hired outside due&#13;
    processat the beginningofthe year).&#13;
&#13;
34. The Civil Service Agency has managedto establishits institutionalcredibility, and even in&#13;
    turbulent political circumstances has been able to assert its roleas guardianof a merit based&#13;
    civil service. Taking into account that the new Civil Service Law did embody all the main&#13;
    principles in the second tranche conditions, and represented enormous progress compared&#13;
    with the previous law, it was agreed that given the difficulties of reversingthe previous&#13;
    amendments to the agreed draft Civil Service Law, satisfactory implementationof the law&#13;
    andthe real progress in carryingout the civil service reformwarrantedrequestinga waiver,&#13;
    given the fact that the Bank team had initially objected to certain provisions of the law&#13;
   when it was approved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                               8&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      Condition3. Amendments, satisfactory to the Association, have been introduced to&#13;
      the Chamber of Accounts Law to: (i)ensure that the Budget Committee of the&#13;
     Parliament has an opportunity to review jointly with the Ministry of Finance the&#13;
      draft budgetofthe ChamberofAccounts prior to its submissionto the Government;&#13;
      (ii)eliminatetheprovisionentitlingtheChamberofAccountsto retain10percentof&#13;
      the amounts recovered to the budget as a result of its activity, and provide&#13;
      compensatoryfunding through the State budget; and (iii)adopt internationalaudit&#13;
      standards acceptableto theAssociation.&#13;
&#13;
35. The conditionhas beenmet. A new law onthe Chamber ofAccounts was adopted in2004.&#13;
   The law establishes new audit standards, meetinginternationalrequirements, and changes the&#13;
   ways of budget formation for the Chamber of Accounts. Since 2005, the only source of the&#13;
    Chamber of Accounts' funding is general budget, and the size of allocations for the Chamber&#13;
    i s determinedjointly with the Ministry o f Finance and Budget Committee o f the parliament.&#13;
   The elimination of the 10 percent recovery charge has had a positive impact in terms of&#13;
   reducingrent seekingbythe COA.&#13;
&#13;
    Condition 4. Actions, satisfactory to the Association, have been taken by the Borrower&#13;
    for integration of the budget related functions of the Budget Commission and&#13;
   Goskominvestwithin the EconomicPolicyCouncil.&#13;
&#13;
36. The condition has been met.            In May 2004, a Government Decree transferred&#13;
   Goskominvest budget functions to EPC and amendments to budget law replaced reference to&#13;
   Budget Commission with EPC. This decision has significantly decreased fragmentation&#13;
   existing previously in budget decisionmakingprocess, with the Budget Commission, which&#13;
   reviewed and approved the recurrent budget and the Goskominvest Committee, responsible&#13;
   for the Public Investment Program (PIP) and the Development Budget (annual investment&#13;
   plan). That practicehad ledto incoherent decisions with regardto macro and fiscal discipline,&#13;
   sector policies and resource allocation. Currently, the Economic Policy Council is the only&#13;
   body considering the whole budget, which provides assurance that overall macroeconomic&#13;
   and fiscal policy decisions occur at a point in the policy-making process that allows the&#13;
   Government to impose fiscally sound, realistic and binding budget constraints and make&#13;
   policytrade-offs.&#13;
&#13;
     Condition 5. An Action Plan, satisfactory to the Association, for transferring all&#13;
     extra-budgetaryaccounts, with the exception of the Social Fund, into the Treasury&#13;
     General Ledger has been adopted by the Borrower's Government and is under&#13;
     successfulimplementation.&#13;
&#13;
37. The condition has been met. The government has been successful in consolidating its&#13;
   resources under the umbrella of the Treasury system. An inventory of all special means&#13;
   accounts (comprised of fees collected by state bodies for specific services rendering) was&#13;
   conducted, and all special means accounts found operating outside the Treasury were&#13;
   transferredinto the Treasury General Ledger. Besides that, the sources of all special means&#13;
   were analyzed and all regulatory fees, as well as fees and fines from inspectionshave been&#13;
   transferredto the Republicanbudget. While closingspecialmeans accounts for the regulatory&#13;
   agencies, the Ministry of Financewas tasked to ensure the provisionof adequate replacement&#13;
   fundingto the agencies concerned.&#13;
&#13;
38. As a result of inventoryof all extra-budgetary funds, the Governmentprepared an actionplan&#13;
   on transferring those funds into the Treasury system, which has been successfully&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                              9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   implemented. The extra-budgetary funds o f the following public entities have been included&#13;
   into the Treasury system: State Committee on State Property Management, State Fund of&#13;
   Economic Development, State Commission on Public Procurement and Material Reserves,&#13;
   Special Funds under the Prime Minister's Office and Presidential Administration, and Fund&#13;
   for Ecologyunder Ministryof Emergency Situations.&#13;
&#13;
    Condition6. The Borrowerhasachieved satisfactoryprogressin the implementation&#13;
    ofthe CPARActionPlan.&#13;
&#13;
39. The condition has been met. In 1997, a Public Procurement Law based on UNCITRAL&#13;
   Model law was enacted. This law established a decentralized procurement system under&#13;
   which procurement is carried out by individual public entities; created State Procurement&#13;
   Agency (an independent oversight body) with authority to issue regulations; and established&#13;
   modern procurement processes.         However, the 2002 Country Procurement Assessment&#13;
   Report (CPAR) indicated a range o f deficiencies in the implementation of the law. Based on&#13;
   the CPAR recommendations, the Government prepared and approved the Action Plan on&#13;
   Public Procurement System improvement (July 2003), which includes separation of&#13;
   procurement function from the functions o f the State Material Reserve; strengthening the&#13;
   legal, monitoring and evaluation and procurement capacity building functions o f the SPA;&#13;
   and strengthening the capacity o f procurement agencies. In general, the implementation o f&#13;
   the plan has been satisfactory, although more needs to be done to build up the capacity of&#13;
   procuring entities at all levels of government to conduct their procurement without the direct&#13;
   involvement o f the SPA. The Government with help o f donors, including the World Bank,&#13;
   has been undertaking certain steps to fill this gap including through training for the involved&#13;
   agencies.&#13;
&#13;
    Condition 7. A Law, satisfactory to the Association, introducing a single-payer&#13;
    systemintheHealthSectorhasbeenenactedbythe Borrower.&#13;
&#13;
40. The conditionhas been met. A single payer law was enacted in 2003, Bishkek Territorial&#13;
   Health Insurance Fundestablished, and legislation amended to establish the responsibility o f&#13;
   the Republican Budget for financing allocations for health care insurance o f pensioners and&#13;
   unemployed. Functional reviews have been conducted o f both the central and local units o f&#13;
   the Ministry.With the introduction o f the Single Payer Law, the Oblast and Rayon financial&#13;
   departments are no longer responsible for health financing.&#13;
&#13;
    Condition8. A capitation-basedformula for calculatingcategorical grants in health&#13;
    and education sectors, satisfactory to the Association, has been developed and&#13;
    introducedbyan appropriatelegalinstrument.&#13;
&#13;
41. The condition has been partially met. The condition was aimed at creating a basis for&#13;
   more transparent and equitable allocation o f budget resources from the central level to health&#13;
   and education institutions, and improving quality o f their services. A Government working&#13;
   group assisted by a local consultancy developed the methodology for the calculation o f the&#13;
   costs o f minimumbasic packages inthe health and education sectors, as well as the formulae&#13;
   for categorical grants inearly 2005.&#13;
&#13;
42. However the education sector did not meet the minimum pre-conditions for the grants to be&#13;
   both equitable and offer incentives to greater efficiency. Thus, prior to the introduction o f&#13;
   categorical grants in education a clear re-definition o f the responsibilities for the delivery o f&#13;
   education services i s required, together with the removal o f nationally mandated staffing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                  10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   norms. It was therefore agreed that there should be no decree on the formula for categorical&#13;
   grants in education until the necessary preconditions had been met.                However, the&#13;
   methodologyfor the calculationof minimumstandards ineducationwas approved and was to&#13;
   be used as benchmark against which the Government would report on actual allocations&#13;
   made. A new system of decentralized financing for local governments is being introduced&#13;
   with the 2007 budget, which will eventually permit the introduction of revised financing&#13;
   arrangements includingper capitafinancingas partof a wider educationreform.&#13;
&#13;
43. At the sametime, in2005 as part ofthe healthreforms,the Governmenttransferredall health&#13;
   institutionsunder the Republicanbudgetjurisdiction, andcategoricalgrants as one element of&#13;
   healthsector financingwas no longerrelevant.&#13;
&#13;
Overall conclusion&#13;
44. The GSAC programwas probably overambitiousin the political and institutionalconditions&#13;
   prevailing in the Kyrgyz Republic. Thus progress was much slower than originally&#13;
   envisaged. Neverthelessthere is little doubt that substantial progress has been made on the&#13;
   governance reform agenda, and continues to be made. In effect, many of the conditions&#13;
   relatingto the release of the third tranche of the credit have also been fulfilled, and it is to be&#13;
   hopethat within arelativelyshortperiodthese will have beencompleted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   11&#13;

            Kyrgyz Republic - Governance Structural
            Adjustment Credit : release of second tranche waiver of two conditions
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This memorandum summarizes the progress
            made under the Governance Structural Adjustment Credit
            (GSAC) to the Kyrgyz Republic. Although the second tranche
            was originally planned for disbursement in mid 2004, there
            were delays in meeting some of the critical conditions,
            which were increased by unstable political conditions in the
            Kyrgyz Republic following the fall of the previous
            government in March 2005. The Kyrgyz Republic has made
            overall satisfactory progress in implementing the Program
            supported by the Governance Structural Adjustment Credit
            (Credit No. 3756-KG) and has met all conditions for release
            of the second tranche of the Credit except for two, for
            which waivers are sought.
