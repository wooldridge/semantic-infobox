of many of our member country&#13;
governments, and the full range of               Given the immense need for private sector&#13;

efforts target small businesses and&#13;
female entrepreneurs throughout sub-saharan africa. We also invest&#13;
in projects across the region in cooperation with other bilateral and&#13;
multilateral institutions. They include the European Investment Bank and&#13;
the private sector development entities of individual countries, such as&#13;
proparco of France.&#13;
     For larger, more complex investment transactions, we take a&#13;
structured approach to coordinating with other institutions, such as&#13;
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. For many&#13;
projects, we actively compete with other financial institutions.&#13;
     We also work with foundations and charitable&#13;
organizations on a variety of initiatives, focusing&#13;
on partnerships related to environmental&#13;
sustainability, health and education, rural&#13;
development, and social entrepreneurship. We are&#13;
developing opportunities for foundations to use&#13;
our extensive network of on-the-ground technical&#13;
assistance providers to help implement and&#13;
monitor projects.&#13;
     The collaboration of our donor partners is&#13;
integral to our success, and we are grateful for&#13;
their support. Donor funds supported programs in&#13;
more than 80 countries this fiscal year, making it&#13;

      IFC in the 1990s: Investing in Mozambique&#13;
&#13;
       IFC often serves as a catalyst, mobilizing new private capital&#13;
       for countries that investors would otherwise consider too&#13;
       risky, as our early investment in mozal, an aluminum smelter&#13;
       in mozambique, illustrates. IFC support of $110 million in&#13;
       financing for the first phase in 1997 was crucial to the&#13;
       $1.3 billion project, the first major foreign investment in&#13;
       mozambique. The resulting business has created well-paying&#13;
       jobs and encouraged others to invest in a poor country still&#13;
       recovering from a devastating civil war.&#13;
            mozal, which was IFC's largest single investment up&#13;
       to that time, has had a positive impact on mozambique's&#13;
       economy. By 2001, it generated 55 percent of the country's&#13;
       exports and accounted for about 8 percent of its GDp. During&#13;
       a second phase of the project in 2001, IFC provided an&#13;
       additional $25 million. We also supported mozal's hIv/aIDs&#13;
       programs and helped the company expand its sourcing from&#13;
       small local businesses.&#13;
            We continue to invest in difficult environments today, in&#13;
       places such as afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo,&#13;
       and Iraq, where the need for private sector development is&#13;
       greatest but financing is scarcest.                                                                                           EssoRBalEllECRuoCEnIoTna&#13;

 demonstrating the sector's profit potential. in addition&#13;
 to investments in nonbank finance companies, lok&#13;
 plans to invest in service companies--independent,&#13;
 private limited companies that originate loans and&#13;
 manage cash flows between microfinance clients&#13;
 and partner banks in exchange for a set fee.&#13;

 microfinance has been successful in test cases by&#13;

 by lok investments will result in microfinance loans&#13;

 products into value-added plastic products. our assistance is expected&#13;
 to produce dual benefits. For suzano, it will create additional demand&#13;
 and potentially higher margins. For Brazil, which is still principally an&#13;
 exporter of primary products, this is a chance to move up the value&#13;
 chain, create new investment opportunities and jobs, and retain more&#13;
 of the value-added within the country. this initiative is expected to&#13;
 support the development of a cluster of 20 to 30 small and medium&#13;

            International Finance Corporation (IFC)
            annual report 2006 : increasing impact - the year in review
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The International Finance Corporation
            (IFC) set a record in fiscal 2006 for new investment
            commitments. This report explores IFC's increasing
            development impact and provides information on its
            investments and other activities for the fiscal year. In its
            50th year, the IFC is the largest provider of multilateral
            financing for private sector projects in the developing
            world. It committed $6.7 billion in funds from its own
            account and mobilized an additional $1.6 billion through
            syndications and $1.3 billion through structured finance.
            Based on the total costs of the private sector projects it
            helped finance this year, each $1 in IFC commitments for its
            own account resulted in an additional $2.88 in funding from
            other sources. Altogether, IFC supported 284 investment
            projects in 66 countries. This year nearly a quarter of IFC
            commitments were in low-income or high-risk countries,
            demonstrating the viability of private enterprise even in
            difficult environments. IFC's investment commitments to
            firms operating in the Middle East and North Africa more
            than doubled in fiscal 2006, and commitments for private
            sector projects in Sub-Saharan Africa increased nearly 60
            percent. IFC introduced a new development outcome tracking
            system for investment operations to measure and track
            results throughout the life of a project; a similar system
            was implemented to monitor the development impact of all
            active technical assistance and advisory projects.
