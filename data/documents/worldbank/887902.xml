HEALTH ISSUES AND POLICIES IN THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES&#13;
A Background Study for World Development Report, 1980&#13;
After two decades of neglect, health has reappeared as a significant concern&#13;
among development authorities and financing institutions. This paper focuses&#13;
on the principal health policy issues that are expected to confront national&#13;
authorities in developing countries over the next two decades. It also&#13;
examines problems in the organization and operation of basic health services,&#13;
and the financing of health care.&#13;
Recent studies have shown that modern medical technology has been a major&#13;
factor influencing health in the developing countries. These studies also&#13;
suggest that improvements in housing, sanitation, and hygiene have contributed&#13;
more modestly to improvements in health in developing countries than they did&#13;
in the economies now advanced. The immediate sector priority therefore is to&#13;
broaden access to the most cost-effective elements of modern health care.&#13;
The most promising solution to the problem of geographic access is primary&#13;
health care, defined as essential health care provided in the community by&#13;
relying upon-community resources. Although the idea has strong political&#13;
support, strategies for its large-scale implementation have not yet been devised.&#13;
This paper explores the organizational and institutional problems that must be&#13;
overcome and examines mechanisms for financing primary health care.&#13;

INTRODUCTION&#13;
This paper was prepared as background for the third World Develop-&#13;
ment Report. It focuses on the major health policy issues that are expected&#13;
to confront national authorities in developing countries over the next two&#13;
decades. It is written primarily for an audience of political leaders,&#13;
development technicians, and health bureaucrats. The paper does not pursue&#13;
medical-technical issues but rather addresses problems in the organization&#13;
and operation of basic health services, and the financing of health care.&#13;
After two decades of neglect, health has reappeared as a significant&#13;
concern among development authorities and financing institutions. From the mid&#13;
1950s through the early 1970s, efforts to improve human health were treated,&#13;
at best, as adding consumption and, more typically, as contributing in a nega-&#13;
tive way to excessive population growth and consequent economic impoverishment.&#13;
This line of thought limited technical and financial assistance to the sector&#13;
and discouraged critical assessment of broad policies and operational pro-&#13;
grams in health. In the early 1970s a number of new discoveries and shifts&#13;
of emphasis in development thinking restored interest in the health sector.&#13;
The following changes were of critical importance:&#13;
First, the view that better health necessaril results in acceler-&#13;
ated population growth was challenged.  The alternative hypothhih&#13;
rates of infant mortality motivate high birth rates--received empirical sup-&#13;
port and gained widespread political acceptance. A majority of countries&#13;
attending the Bucharest Conference on Population in 1974 strongly endorsed&#13;
the notion that economic development and health improvements are prerequi-&#13;
sites for fertility decline.&#13;
Second, attention focused on development of human resources as&#13;
development  oc                                        he dfetwrdibUtn foef  b&#13;
fits from economic growth. High levels of disease among the very poor clearly&#13;
lower their capacity to learn and to adapt, thus reducing the effective labor&#13;
supply. Improvements in health would promote learning, reduce absenteeism,&#13;
improve stamina, and increase energy output. Therefore, better health, espe-&#13;
cially among adults, would contribute to improving the economic status of the&#13;
poor and to expanding total output.&#13;
Third, the international concern in the mid 1970s for achieving&#13;
human rights and meeting basic human needs reoriented development programs&#13;
to alleviate further the symptoms of poverty. High rates of illness and pre-&#13;
mature death in developing countries stood out as examples of the failure of&#13;
development to meet human needs.&#13;
Fourth, evidence appeared indicating that a number of low income&#13;
countries had succeeded in significantly reducing disease, using simple low-&#13;
cost methods of health care.  The fact that these methods were within the&#13;
economic resources of even the poorest countries gave improving health care&#13;
additional urgency, and thus confirmed the feasibility of health care for all.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ii -&#13;
Fifth, broad international political support for increasing access&#13;
to basic health services emerged. In 1978 the International Conference on&#13;
Primary Health Care gave political and professional legitia&#13;
consensus on health priorities.&#13;
Improving access to essential health care services for the poor&#13;
is now the major policy issue in the sector. Recent studies have demonstrated&#13;
that modern medical technology has been a major factor influencing health in&#13;
the developing countries. These studies also suggest that improvements in&#13;
housing, sanitation and hygiene have contributed more modestly to improve-&#13;
ments in health in developing countries than they did in the now advanced&#13;
The immediate sector priority is tn hrandn  'roc tn the mnst&#13;
cost-effective elements of modern health care.&#13;
The concept of primary health care has been advanced as the most&#13;
promising solution to the problem of geographic access. Primary health care&#13;
is defined as essential health care provided in the community by relying&#13;
upon community resources. It must be technically appropriate and acceptable&#13;
to beneficiaries. It includes maternal and child health care, immunization,&#13;
care of iniuries and promotion of nutrition and sanitation.  Although the&#13;
concept has strong political support, a strategy for its large-scale imple-&#13;
mentation has not yet been devised.  In order to achieve the goal of access&#13;
to health care, organizational and institutional problems must be overcome&#13;
and suitable financing mechanisms must be developed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Health Conditions and Resources in 1980&#13;
For the developing countries as a group, life expectancy at birth&#13;
is about 54 years. There are, however, major regional differences: life&#13;
expectancy in Africa is now about 46 years; in South Asia it is about 51&#13;
years, and in Latin America, about 63 years. In contrast, life expectancy&#13;
in the more developed countries is Just over 70 years. 1/&#13;
The low life expectancy in developing countries is due largely to v 4f&amp; &gt;&#13;
very high death rates among children. In the poorest districts of very low-i&#13;
income countries half of all children die during the first year of life.&#13;
However, major regional differences in child mortality rates (like life&#13;
expectancy) exist. In Africa, for example, the infant mortality rate is&#13;
more than 120 deaths per 1,000 live births, compared with 53 in Latin America&#13;
and 15 in Europe and North America. 2/&#13;
For those in developing countries who reach the age of five, life&#13;
expectancy is only eight to nine years less than in developed countries.&#13;
These survivors suffer frequently, however, from nonfatal diseases. Detailed&#13;
data on health conditions, including morbidity, are available for only a few&#13;
countries and even then are of doubtful accuracy. The few detailed studies&#13;
available suggest that illness disrupts normal activities for roughly one-&#13;
tenth of people's time in most developing countries. In contrast, residents&#13;
of more developed countries report that illnesses interferes with normal&#13;
activities about 5 percent of the time. The definition of "incapacitating&#13;
illness" appears to differ with wealthier people being more willing to halt&#13;
work or to escape usual responsibilities. Many nonfatal illnesses are inter-&#13;
mittent with recurrent acute episodes; these illnesses disrupt economic&#13;
activity, often at critical times, such as the planting and harvesting seasons&#13;
in the case of malaria. Chronic and debilitating diseases impair mental con-&#13;
centration, learning ability and economic productivity. Degenerative chronic&#13;
diseases such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer, are less preva-&#13;
lent in developing than in developed countries, primarily because a small&#13;
proportion of the total population has survived to late adulthood. These&#13;
diseases are becoming serious problems in the developing countries, however,&#13;
especially among affluent, middle-aged, urbanized persons. Accidental injuries&#13;
are also emerging as a major cause of death and disability in many countries.&#13;
Intercountry Variations in Health&#13;
Health conditions vary more among the less developed countries than between&#13;
more and less developed ones. Life expectancy varies from about 40 years (Mali,&#13;
Angola, and Upper Volta) to about 70 years (Sri Lanka, Singapore, and Argentina).&#13;
Life expectancy generally rises with per capita incomes, thus lending credence&#13;

2/ United Nations, Demographic Estimates and Projections.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
to the old notion that economic development is good medicine. But the high&#13;
levels of health in a few very poor areas (Sri Lanka and the Indian state of&#13;
Kerala, for example) and the low life expectancy in a smaller number of&#13;
relatively wealthy areas (Brazil and Nigeria) demonstrate that the relation-&#13;
ship is neither simple nor inescapable. Moreover, the pattern of disease&#13;
and the scale of morbidity both vary widely across geographic areas. The&#13;
differences reflect not only variations in income levels, environmental&#13;
sanitation, access to health care, levels of education, etc., but also such&#13;
uncontrollable factors as climate. The following paragraphs attempt to&#13;
highlight the conditions prevailing in selected regions of the world.&#13;
The highest rates of infant and early childhood mortality and the&#13;
lowest life expectancies are reported by the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa.&#13;
Life expectancy ranges from 39 years to 54 years (lower than the average for&#13;
India). It is estimated that at least a million African children die each&#13;
year without reaching the age of five. In much of Africa, half of all&#13;
deaths occur among children under five.&#13;

The countries of Southeast Asia and the South Pacific face the&#13;
second most grave health problems. The region is characterized by popula-&#13;
tion pressures, borderline nutritional status, and difficult water supply&#13;
and waste management problems. On the other hand, it is relatively literate,&#13;
its communities are often highly organized, and its public administration&#13;
is generally fairly well developed. Wide intercountry variations are found&#13;
not only in health but in income, education, and climate. Life expectancy&#13;
for the region, excluding China, is about 51 years--somewhat below the&#13;
average for all developing countries.  Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and&#13;
Korea are industrializing rapidly and have life expectancies at birth between&#13;
63-72 years, whereas Laos People's Democratic Republic has a very low life&#13;
expectancy at birth (42 years) and very high crude death rates ( 2 ier 1', fl).&#13;

In South Asia, Sri Lanka and the State of Kerala in India differ&#13;
significantly from the remaining areas of the region. Life expectancy is 69&#13;
years in Sri Lanka as compared to only 43 years in Nepal. More accessible&#13;
health services, higher literacy, good transportation and communications, and&#13;
more equitable distribution of food seem to account for these two exceptional&#13;
areas. 3/  Kerala reports especially high health status, even though incomes&#13;
are significantly lower than Indian national averages. &#13;

The goal of the ten-year health plan (1970-1980) for the Americas&#13;
was to increase life expectancy at birth by five years in those countries&#13;
where it was below 65 years in 1970. More than one-third of all Latin American&#13;
countries had surpassed this goal by 1977, and all are expected to gain at&#13;
least three years by 1980. Temperate South America is expected to reach 70&#13;
years of life expectancy by 1980; tropical South America, with the exception&#13;
of Bolivia, should reach 65 years; Caribbean countries, excluding Dominican&#13;
Republic and Haiti have surpassed 70 years of life expectancy.&#13;
Deaths per 1,000 population in Latin America decreased from around&#13;
11 in 1960 to around 8 in the early 1970s. Although there were 18 Latin&#13;
American countries with crude death rates greater than 10 per 1,000 in 1960,&#13;
only 6 countries continued to experience this rate by 1975. The ratio of&#13;
percent decreases of deaths under 1 year of age to present decreases of&#13;
deaths 1-4 years of age between 1968 and 1974 was approximately 1:1 in North&#13;
America, 1:4 in Central America, and 1:2 in South America. Thus, greater&#13;
achievement has been attained in reducing deaths of 1-4 year olds in Latin&#13;
America during this period. 4/&#13;

Health Resources&#13;
Problems of health infrastructure development and health personnel&#13;
availability in developing countries vary among regions and between rural and&#13;
urban areas within countries. The following describes, by region, the current&#13;
status of physical resources in the health sector in terms of both quantity&#13;
and distribution.&#13;
Africa: Access to health facilities in rural areas of African&#13;
countries is inadequate. On the average, ratios of population to hospital&#13;
beds are 15 to 20 times those in developed countries.5/ Moreover, these few&#13;
facilities often must cover wide geographic expanses and large numbers ot&#13;
people. Inadequate transportation systems and the cost of transport and&#13;
lodging further limit actual rural coverage. In Kenya, for example, 40 per-&#13;
cent of the outpatients coming to rural health centers lived within 8 km;&#13;
30 percent lived 8 to 16 km away; and 30 percent lived more than 16 km away. 6/&#13;
The distribution of facilities favors urban areas. In Borno State,&#13;
Nigeria, for example, where 80 percent of the population lives in villages,&#13;
5/ World Health Organization, WHO Quarterly Reports, Geneva, 1979, p. 696.&#13;
6/ Ministry of Health, Kenya, Rural Health Strategy, 1973.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
only 50 percent of health clinics are in rural areas. 7/ There are only 233&#13;
persons per dispensary in the semiurban areas surrounding Lagos, whereas in&#13;
outlying, rural states there are between 25,000 and 60,000 persons per&#13;
dispensary. 8/&#13;
Africa has a severe shortage of medical personnel, with between&#13;
20,000 and 40,000 persons per physician. Moreover, medical personnel are&#13;
poorly distributed. The overwhelming majority of physicians practice in&#13;
urban areas where 10 percent to 20 percent of the population lives, while&#13;
rural areas are left virtually unserved. In Senegal, for example, 76 percent&#13;
of the nation's physicians are concentrated in the capital (Dakar) area,&#13;
where only 17 percent of the population lives. 9/  Yet expanding the supply&#13;
of physicians is prohibitively expensive for most African nations; medical&#13;
training alone costs more than $25,000 per physician exclusive of the capital&#13;
costs of medical schools and teaching hospitals. 10/  Health personnel other&#13;
than physicians are also in short supply. On the average, Africa has only 4&#13;
to 6 nurses/midwives per 10,000 persons, compared to 63 in North America.ll/&#13;
Such shortages impede expansion of health care systems to currently under-&#13;
served populations.&#13;
The following table presents data on health facilities and personnel&#13;
for selected African nations:&#13;

South Asia: South Asia has more abundant health manpower than&#13;
Africa but a similar lack of facilities. The major exception is Sri Lanka,&#13;
where a determined program of development of infrastructure and personnel&#13;
has resulted in ratios of population to resources that are among the lowest&#13;
in the developing world.&#13;
South Asia averages 3,000 to 4,000 persons per hospital bed, but&#13;
only about 30 percent of these beds are located in rural areas. A fairly&#13;
widespread system of private medical facilities compensates to some degree&#13;
for public sector maldistribution. Health centers and clinics,or subcenters&#13;
in rural areas,are often understaffed and so do not adequately serve their&#13;
catchment areas, which often exceed 100,000 persons each. In India, for&#13;
example, only 58 percent of rural health centers operate with full staff&#13;
complemer.t. 13/&#13;
Although the supply of physicians is greater in South Asian coun-&#13;
tries such as India than in other developing regions, population/physician&#13;
ratios are about 2,000:1 in urban areas and 12,000:1 in rural regions. 14/&#13;
Ratios of population to nursing personnel average 455:1 with Bangladesh and&#13;
Nepal having the greatest shortages. 15/  The following table presents com-&#13;

Southeast Asia and Pacific: The health facilities in South Asia&#13;
and the Pacific are relatively well developed, particularly at the hospital&#13;
level. Ratios of population per hospital bed for Thailand, the Philippines,&#13;
and Papua New Guinea are among the lowest in the developing world outside of&#13;
Latin America. Major programs of expansion of rural health centers have been&#13;
undertaken recently by countries in this region. In Indonesia, for example,&#13;
the major goal of the health plans from 1969 to 1979 was to ensure one health&#13;
center per rural administrative unit; by 1977 this goal had been exceeded.&#13;
However, underutilization of public health facilities is a serious problem&#13;
throughout this region, due either to poor staffing and management as in&#13;
Thailand, or due to competition with highly complex systems of traditional&#13;
medicine as in Indonesia. 16/&#13;
Countries in the Southeast Asia and Pacific region have pursued&#13;
vigorous programs of training for health personnel. Thailand, for example,&#13;
nearly doubled the number of nurses between 1968 and 1975. 17/  In Indonesia,&#13;
the second national plan (1974-1979) sought to double the number of nurses&#13;
and nearly to double the number of health assistants.&#13;
Except in Indonesia, physicians are in relatively plentiful supply&#13;
in the region. However, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand face&#13;
major problems of physician emigration due to greater opportunities abroad&#13;
for specialization and economic advancement. However, the distribution of&#13;
physicians remains a problem for most countries.  In Indones a A t fnr-A&#13;
cent of phys;c; nn  n   oncetrated in urban areas.  In Thailand there are&#13;
three times as ma-y physicians in Bangkok as in the remainder of the cuty&#13;
In Korea there is eight times as much physician time available per capita&#13;
in Seoul as in the rural provinces. 18/&#13;
Thus, the region faces problems of poor access and underutiliza-&#13;
tion of health facilities, and of maldistribution and emigration of health&#13;
personnel. Table 7 presents comparative physical resources data for selected&#13;
countries in the region.&#13;

Latin America: Latin America has the most developed and best dis-&#13;
tributed health infrastructure of any region of the developing world. Ratios&#13;
of population to infrastructure often compare favorably to those of developed&#13;
countries. Argentina, for example, has a lower population per hospital ratio&#13;
than does Spain. Exceptions to this relatively bright picture, however, are&#13;
found in Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador.&#13;
The population per health worker fell from 500 to about 360 from&#13;
1970 to 1976. The population per physician decreased from 1,800 in 1964 to&#13;
1,300 in 1976. 19/  Wide variations are found throughout the regions.  In&#13;
1976, Central America had 1,400 people per physician, whereas tropical South&#13;
America had 1,600 and temperate South America had 600--a ratio similar to&#13;
that of the United States. 20/  But the urban-rural distribution of physicians&#13;
remains skewed, with two-thirds of physicians located in large cities, where&#13;
only one-third of the population resides. 21/  In North America there were&#13;
248 nurses and 411 nursing auxiliaries for every 100 physicians in 1976; in&#13;
South America there were 32 nurses and 134 nursing auxiliaries per 100 physi-&#13;
cians. In Central America there were 80 nurses and 132 nursing auxiliaries&#13;
per 100 physicians. The relative scarcity of nurses is largely a function&#13;
of their lower social status in Latin America but also reflects the emigra-&#13;
tion of some 20 percent of nurses to North America.&#13;
Problems of structure, distribution, and emigration characterize&#13;
health personnel in Latin America. Rather than a pyramid with a broad base&#13;
of auxiliary personnel, a body of technicians and an apex of professionals,&#13;

Middle East: The level of development of health infrastructure and&#13;
personnel in the Middle East varies widely due primarily to vast income and&#13;
environmental differences. The oil exporting nations of the Arabian Peninsula&#13;
have per capita incomes among the highest in the world. Some of their prob-&#13;
lems of infrastructure and personnel development are serious, especially as&#13;
regards access to services by nomadic populations. Nonetheless, they have&#13;
made very significant progress in recent years.&#13;
Health infrastructure in the Middle East generally is poorly dis-&#13;
tributed.  In Syria, for example, 45 percent of the health clinics are&#13;
located in Damascus and Aleppo.  The population per hospital bed in Damascus&#13;
is one-tenth that in the rural provinces of Al Hasakeh or Al Rakka.23/  In&#13;
Jordan 71 percent of the hospital beds are located in Amman, which has 57&#13;
percent of the population. 24/&#13;
In Afghanistan, on the other hand, basic health centers outside of&#13;
urban areas are well distributed, but fall far short of the needed numbers.&#13;

Similarly, in the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) 95 percent of&#13;
health clinics and centers are located outside of Aden, but total numbers are&#13;
inadequate, resulting in insufficient rural access. 25/  Egypt has developed&#13;
a well-distributed rural system with sufficient numbers of rural health units&#13;
to ensure that there is a health care facility within three kilometers of&#13;
every village. However, problems of management and supplies limit utilization. 26/&#13;
Shortages and maldistribution of some categories of health person-&#13;
nel characterize Middle Eastern countries. Nursing, laboratory and technician&#13;
staff are generally in short supply. Cultural and religious traditions require&#13;
that women be attended only by females, yet all countries in the region have&#13;
a critical shortage of female personnel. Since this problem is in part a&#13;
result of the lack of women with the prerequisite educational levels, many of&#13;
the countries in the region have turned to training traditional midwives to&#13;
ensure access to services for women and children. These and other shortages&#13;
are often characteristic of national personnel. In the Yemen Arab Republic, for&#13;
example, 47 percent of physicians and 20 percent of nurses are expatriates. 27/&#13;
Maldistribution also characterizes health manpower in the region.&#13;
In Syria, 65 percent of the midwives practice in Damascus, leaving only 300&#13;
midwives to serve the rest of the country. In PDRY, 73 percent of physicians&#13;
practice in Aden, and in Jordan, 76 percent practice in Amman. 28/&#13;
Table 9 indicates the variations in the region in the availability&#13;
of health facilities and personnel.&#13;

National Health Care Expenditures&#13;
Although expenditures for health care in developing countries are&#13;
modest, they are much greater than is generally acknowledged. In Africa,&#13;
governments report spending from $1 to $55 per capita a year; in Latin America&#13;
and the Caribbean, governments report outlays of up to $68. However, the&#13;
figures fail to account for many health-related expenditures.&#13;
Officially reported health expenditures are obtained by the World&#13;
Health Organization from national health ministries. The definition of health&#13;
and the completeness of reports varies widely. For purposes of reporting,&#13;
the health sector is generally defined to include delivery of medical care to&#13;
individuals, mass immunization, and control of vector-borne diseases. Activ-&#13;
ities such as monitoring outbreaks of disease and monitoring of air quality,&#13;
food processing, water supply, and waste disposal are sometimes included if&#13;
these functions are under the direct control of the national ministry of&#13;
health. Activities in health and hygiene education, environmental sanitation,&#13;
family planning, food fortification, solid waste disposal, rodent control,&#13;
etc., that are typically overseen by other ministries but are nonetheless&#13;
undertaken primarily to promote health, are rarely included.&#13;
Operating and capital budgets are also poorly distinguished. Many&#13;
ministries of health do not separate budgets for operating units into recur-&#13;
rent and development expenditures. In addition, frequently development activ-&#13;
ities--training, construction, well drilling, etc.--are undertaken by other&#13;
agencies and the capital costs are not accounted for at all by the ministry&#13;
of health. The value of the services of these capital goods is frequently&#13;
omitted from reports of health expenditures, thus understating the current&#13;
efforts in health.&#13;
A number of countries--India, Brazil, and Nigeria, for example-&#13;
delegate responsibility for health care to local governments or states. In&#13;
addition, most Latin American and a growing number of Asian countries have&#13;
established social security programs or health insurance schemes that finance&#13;
health care. The completeness of reports of spending on health by agencies&#13;
other than national ministries of health varies widely from country to country,&#13;
further undermining the validity and comparability of the published data.&#13;
Thus, intercountry comparisons are hazardous.&#13;
Conversion of Health Expenditures into US Dollars: Expenditures in&#13;
local currency are usually converted into US dollars, using official exchange&#13;
rates. In order to provide a somewhat more realistic picture of health bud-&#13;
gets, they are also presented here in terms of purchasing power parity with&#13;
US dollars. This further adjustment seeks to recognize major differences&#13;
among countries in the cost of labor. 29/  Ideally the labor component of&#13;
29/ The present calculations are based upon the method devised by Isenman.&#13;
Paul Isenman, "Intercountry Comparison of 'Real' (PPP) Incomes: Revised&#13;
Estimates and Unresolved Questions." World Bank Staff Working Paper&#13;
No. 358, Washington, DC, September 1979.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
the budget would be adjusted to reflect the relative rates of compensation&#13;
for health workers in a particular country contrasted with, say, the United&#13;
States; however, this has not been feasible. The cost of materials and&#13;
supplies that enter into international commerce should be reckoned at inter-&#13;
national dollar prices. The method used here adjusts for these phenomena&#13;
on an economywide basis, understating the importance of the labor component&#13;
of health care (which forms a greater fraction of total health expenditure&#13;
than does labor in the total economy) but also overstating the adjustment&#13;
applicable to internationally mobile, highly-trained health manpower, espe-&#13;
cially physicians. The use of purchasing power parities rather than official&#13;
exchange rates more than doubles reported health expenditures in most develop-&#13;
ing countries. In countries rich in human resources--such as India, Sri&#13;
Lanka, and the Philippines--the conversion more than trebles the reported&#13;
amounts. In purchasing power parities, budgets for health in developing&#13;
countries range from $1.46 to more than $100.00 per capita.&#13;

Private Sector Expenditures for Health: Amounts spent by individ-&#13;
uals and private voluntary organizations are not documented except in a&#13;
handful of countries. Private sector expenditures include fees required by&#13;
public facilities, illegal payments to obtain drugs or preferential treatment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
from government officials, costs of private care, and outlays for herbs,&#13;
drugs, and appliances obtained from private suppliers. In many developing&#13;
countries, payments to pharmacists and to traditional health workers repre-&#13;
sent a prominent part of total health expenditures. In addition to direct&#13;
payments for goods and services, substantial expenditures are made for&#13;
transportation to health facilities and for food and lodging while at the&#13;
facility. Often a second person must accompany the person seeking care,&#13;
thereby doubling these indirect costs. A study of Makerere University Hos-&#13;
pital in Uganda revealed that the costs of travel exceeded half the direct&#13;
cost of care, even though this is a sophisticated referral hospital. 30/&#13;
In rural areas, where distances are greater and the level of care (and hence&#13;
direct operating costs) more modest, travel costs probably represent a&#13;
larger share of the total costs of health care.&#13;
Several attempts have been made to estimate private expenditures&#13;
for health care in developing countries. These studies have been based on&#13;
both household expenditures surveys and studies of the receipts of providers;&#13;
a few investigations have sought to reconcile these two sources of data in&#13;
order to obtain more precise values. The major difficulty in estimating pri-&#13;
vate expenditures has been the reluctance of individuals to report spending&#13;
for traditional and indigenous forms of health care, and for illegal payments&#13;
to government officials for drugs or preferential treatment.&#13;
Expenditures by private voluntary organizations are also difficult&#13;
to measure. Those operated from developed countries often obtain supplies&#13;
and staff either free or at concessionary prices. Thus, the documented&#13;
receipts and expenditures of missions and philantrophic groups tend to under-&#13;
state the value of their efforts. However, the inputs supplied to such&#13;
organizations often are not well adapted to local needs and thus should not&#13;
be valued at full market price. Private voluntary organizations are espe-&#13;
cially important in Africa and South Asia.&#13;
Table 11 presents a detailed accounting of health expenditures for&#13;
three countries. It reveals that reported public spending for health may&#13;
represent as little as a third of total spending, exclusive of the cost of&#13;
travel and maintenance necessary to obtain care. This information suggests&#13;
that the quantity of resources being committed to health is much greater than&#13;
is generally acknowledged, implying that the financial constraints to pro-&#13;
viding basic health services are much less severe than is commonly asserted.&#13;
Reallocation of private resources, however, is not likely to be easy unless&#13;
considerable attention is paid to the acceptability to clients of new forms&#13;
of health care. A recent ILO study of household spending for health in two&#13;
countries indicates that private spending can be redirected. 31/  The ILO&#13;
found that modern basic health care was substituted for traditional care when&#13;
it was made readily available. Whether this finding is generally applicable&#13;
is uncertain.&#13;

Recent Trends in Health Conditions in Developing Countries&#13;
Life Expectancy&#13;
Between 1940 and 1970 life expectancy in the developing countries&#13;
increased by about 70 percent. In the decade following World War II, such&#13;
diverse countries as Jamaica, Malaysia, Mauritius, Mexico, Sri Lanka, and&#13;
Taiwan recorded gains in life expectancy each year of more than a year; in&#13;
Sri Lanka and Mauritius gains exceeded two years annually between 1946 and&#13;
1953, when antimalaria programs were being implemented. 1/ However, these&#13;
advances have slowed significantly in recent years. Table 12 shows that&#13;
annual increases in life expectancy were about two-thirds as great in the&#13;
late 1960s and early 1970s as in the mid 1950s. Observers now believe that&#13;
this loss of momentum compounded in the late 1970s. The nearly three-fold&#13;
increase in cases of malaria between 1972 and 1976 and the more modest but&#13;
nonetheless significant growth in the incidence of the several other major&#13;
parasitic diseases have been especially alarming. Renewed efforts to con-&#13;
trol malaria since 1978 appear to have reversed the trend. 2/&#13;
Attempts to understand why developing countries are not maintain-&#13;
ing their earlier pace in controlling disease have revealed four important&#13;
facts. First, a large part of the postwar gains in health were obtained&#13;
through control of the carriers of parasitic diseases using insecticides.&#13;
These successes were reversed when these programs fell into disrepair. The&#13;
resurgence of malaria and African sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis), are&#13;
the most notable examples. With success, control programs lost much of&#13;
their political priority; staffing and budgets were cut. In addition they&#13;
grew much more costly as disease vectors acquired resistence to common pesti-&#13;
cides and pesticide prices escalated. The parasites themselves also became&#13;
tolerant of available drugs because of massive, indiscriminate use. Second,&#13;
economic developments and urbanization compounded the threat of disease.&#13;

For example, irrigated agriculture greatly expanded the habitat of the snails&#13;
that transmit schistosomiasis. Irrigation also compounded problems of drain-&#13;
age and wastewater management, thereby encouraging the breeding of mosquitos.&#13;
Industrialization and income growth introduced occupational hazards and&#13;
increased the risk of motor vehicle accidents.  Rapid urban growth compounded&#13;
problems of environmental sanitation--especially water supply and excreta&#13;
disposal.  urbanization also contributed to social dislocation and thereby&#13;
contributed to increases in soci lly transmftteddisese and mental health&#13;
problems. Third, modern health care has failed recently to continue to&#13;
expand coverage and thereby to improve average health conditions. This&#13;
failure is reflected most vividly in the differences in life expectancy&#13;
between highly urbanized and rural areas of developing countries. For example,&#13;
life expectancy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, was 56 years in 1973, whereas in&#13;
the poorest region of the country (Kigoma) where health activities were least&#13;
developed it was 37. 3/  Life expectancy in the developed, urbanized, south-&#13;
east of Brazil was 31 percent greater than the rural northeast in 1970. 4/&#13;
Still more dramatic comparisons appear when smaller areas are considered.&#13;
Finally, poor utilization of health services and noncompliance with new&#13;
approaches to health promotion are becoming major obstacles to further gains&#13;

in health. The role of general education--especially education of mothers-&#13;
as a factor determining willingness to seek care and to improve health and&#13;
hygiene practices has been documented in several studies.5/  They show that&#13;
the chief effect of education is to weaken traditional authority structures&#13;
rather than to change people's understanding of disease. Research in West&#13;
Africa suggests that the social status of women obtained by having a higher&#13;
educational attainment than husbands or mothers-in-law may be the most&#13;
important variable influencing willingness to seek modern health care and to&#13;
comply with recommendations from the modern health care system. 6/  Since&#13;
mothers play a major role in child care this willingness has strongly&#13;
impacted both maternal and child health.&#13;
Morbidity and Mortality&#13;
The rapid improvement in health status in developing countries&#13;
between 1940 and 1970 resulted principally from reductions in mortality due&#13;
to infectious and parasitic diseases. This was accomplished through improve-&#13;
ments in nutrition, immunization, use of antibiotics, and better control of&#13;
the carriers of disease. The gains were most notable in the communicable&#13;
diseases of childhood and respiratory infections. Unlike the advanced econ-&#13;
omies at similar levels of health development, few developing countries made&#13;
significant progress in dealing with the diarrheal diseases. Improvements&#13;
in hygiene were uncommon despite significant investments in water supply&#13;
and sanitation.                                                                 AX      &#13;
The man-made, largely urban hatkroblems--accidents, occupa-&#13;
tional hazards, and stress-related diseases--have afflicted low-income coun-&#13;
tries much as they have advanced economies. In some instances economic con&#13;
str-aintsh e even compoundedthesie problems.  The drive to achieve competi-&#13;
tive costs has led industries in developing countries to adopt lower stand-&#13;
ards of job safety than prevail in advanced countries. Although this policy&#13;
may be justified even in terms oT health, sice it contributes indirectly to&#13;
better nutrition, housing, sanitation, etc., it nonetheless results in high&#13;
accident rates. The joint use of roadways by pedestrians, bicycles, and&#13;
motor vehicles is a major reason for the high toll of highway accidents.&#13;
The number of deaths per automobile is ten time as great in Brazil as in the&#13;
United States, and is eight times as great per passenger mile. 7/ The very&#13;

high risks of injury reflect modest investments in traffic signaling devices,&#13;
road design, and enforcement of traffic safety laws.                             J&#13;
As noted above, the recent collapse of programs to control endemic&#13;
diseases--especially malaria--has permitted several important diseases to&#13;
reemerge as serious public health problems. Cholera and food-borne bacterial&#13;
diseases have also reappeared as serious problems. In addition, disruption&#13;
of traditional forms of village social organization and the growth of tourism&#13;
have increased psycho-social stress, especially in urban areas. As a result,&#13;
mental health has declined and sexually-transmitted diseases have grown&#13;
dramatically in importance. 8/&#13;
Role of Urbanization&#13;
Urbanization is a major factor affecting the pattern of disease.&#13;
Urbanization is associated with new occupational hazards, greater contact&#13;
with motor vehicles, and crowding. On the other hand, urban areas character-&#13;
istically offer higher incomes, better access to health care, more diverse&#13;
diets, and greater educational opportunities. Those who emigrate to urban&#13;
areas are generally younger, better educated, and more adaptive than those&#13;
who remain in villages. In addition, provision of services in urban settings&#13;
is less costly, since logistics, transportation, communications, supervision, C&#13;
administration, and recruitment of staff are all easier.  There are often&#13;
social barriers, however, to utilization of health services that derive from&#13;
migrants' distrust of the bureaucracy and government.&#13;
Over the next two decades urbanization is expected to increase&#13;
dramatically. The World Bank estimates that in the developing countries as&#13;
a group, the urban population will increase from 31 percent to 45 percent&#13;
of the total between 1975 and 2000. Furthermore, per capita incomes are&#13;
expected to increase by more than half. 9/  Thesa two sets of developments&#13;
by themselves will profoundly affect the health problems that confront low-&#13;
income countries as well as the opportunities for dealing with them. Life&#13;
expectancy in the cities of middle-income countries should approach that in&#13;
advanced economies by the end of the century. The major challenges to health '1&#13;
care then will be accidents, occupational hazards, degenerative diseases, and l-&#13;
the diseases of social dislocation.                                              .4&#13;
Socioeconomic Development and Health&#13;
On the basis of data for Norway, England, and Wales in the late&#13;
19th century, it has been argued by public health experts that general socio-&#13;
economic development is the major factor determining health. Analyses of the&#13;
experiences of these countries have revealed that the greatest improvements&#13;

in health were achieved prior to the discovery of the major tools of modern&#13;
medicine through improvements in housing, water supply, waste disposal, nutri-&#13;
tion, and education. Moreover, it has been easy to construct causal links&#13;
between these chan8s and health status, giving greater force to the argument&#13;
that socioeconomic development is the most important determinant of health.&#13;
Since the 1930s medical sciences have advanced dramatically, espe-&#13;
cially in the area of infectious disease. Moreover, there have been major&#13;
developments in pest control. In part as a consequence of these developments,&#13;
the link between incomes and health has been greatly weakened. For example,&#13;
life expectancy in Africa in 1980 is roughly similar to life expectancy for&#13;
American blacks in the early 1930s, even though incomes for the latter were&#13;
more than four times as great in 1930 as for Africans in 1980. Similarly,&#13;
life expectancy in India now exceeds life expectancy in France in the 1920s,&#13;
even though incomes, nutritional status, and educational levels in India now&#13;
are substantially inferior to those in France at that time.&#13;
A recent study of trends in mortality by cause substantiates the&#13;
view that the relationship between deaths and socioeconomic conditions has&#13;
shifted markedly over the last half century. 10/  Using information on death&#13;
by cause for 165 populations in 43 countries, the study concluded that incomes&#13;
in the 1930s were 2.6 times as large as in the 1960s at the same level of&#13;
life expectancy. About a third of the decline in death rates underlying this&#13;
change was due to control of infectious disease and about a quarter to control&#13;
of respiratory diseases. 11/ One of the classical sources of improvements in&#13;
mortality and life expectancy--control of diarrheal disease-actually decreased&#13;
in importance, clearly implying that the major causal factor--improved hygiene-&#13;
was not operating. The remaining roughly 40 percent of improvement was attrib-&#13;
utable to a wide range of causes, with little country-to-country similarity; the&#13;
largest reduction has occurred in the category of cardiovascular disease.&#13;
Using information for the 1930s and 1960s separately, the study&#13;
analyzed the relationships between incomes and the life expectancy. The&#13;
relationship prevailing in the 1930s together with income levels in 1960 were&#13;
used to estimate life expectance in the 1960s in the absence of any change in&#13;
the relationship between income and health. This exercise predicted a gain&#13;
in life expectancy of 2.5 years between 1938 and 1963 for the world, compared&#13;
with the actual gain of 12.2 years, suggesting that other factors contributed&#13;
9.7 years. The study also examined the gain under the assumption that the&#13;
1960s' relationship prevailed in 1938. This alternative formulation of the&#13;
question suggested that improvements in incomes over the 25 years would have&#13;
increased life expectancy by only 1.3 years. Thus these two analyses yield&#13;
the consistent conclusion that income growth explains only about 16 percent of&#13;
the improvement in life expectancy over the quarter century under study. 12/&#13;

The methods employed in the study leave untouched questions of how&#13;
changes in income distribution, prices of health-affecting goods, and educa-&#13;
tional attainments might have influenced its conclusions. In particular,&#13;
since the study was carried out with national rather than individual data,&#13;
the regression analysis does not recognize the possibility that improvements&#13;
in income distribution might explain in part the extraordinary growth in life&#13;
expectancy.  However, for the period under examination-1938 to 1963-it is&#13;
doubtful that significant improvements in income distribution were recorded.&#13;
A decrease in the cost of health-enhancing goods and services might also&#13;
explain a deterioration of the relationship between health and income, but&#13;
the goods that influence health most profoundly did not generally decrease&#13;
in relative unit price, with perhaps the exception of food in some countries.&#13;
Expansion of educational opportunities and improvements in the status of women&#13;
were modest during the period under study. One concludes, therefore, that&#13;
the significant gains in health status were indeed largely due to advances in&#13;
health care.&#13;
A fairly stable cross-sectional relationship between health and&#13;
income has remained in effect over the period of analysis. Only at the lowest&#13;
levels of income has there been a shift in the relationship, and that has&#13;
been for the worse. The very poor continue to suffer a significantly greater&#13;
burden of disease than higher income groups. Again, this conclusion is drawn&#13;
from national rather than individual data and may reflect the fact that the&#13;
poorest countries have not mounted significant health programs. This inter-&#13;
pretation is at once consistent with the discovery of a very large shift in&#13;
the curve relating income and life expectancy, and the observation that the&#13;
poorest countries have not participated fully in these gains.&#13;
Influence of Various Diseases on Life Expectancy&#13;
The role of various diseases in determining life expectancy was&#13;
also investigated in the study. Table 13 presents the expected gains in life&#13;
expectancy attributable to control of particular diseases for persons at&#13;
various initial life expectancies. The statistical analysis confirms the&#13;
judgment of health workers that medically treatable diseases form a major&#13;
part of the excess mortality in low-income countries. For example, at African&#13;
levels of life expectancy, about 11 years of the loss in life expectancy is&#13;
due to infectious and parasitic diseases and problems related to childbirth.&#13;
Most of this loss could be avoided with proper medical care. About 2.5 years&#13;
of loss of life is due to diarrheal diseases. At an Asian standard of life&#13;
expectancy, the group of treatable diseases accounts for about 9.7 years of&#13;
premature death, whereas diarrheal disease is responsible for about 2.2 years.&#13;
Table 14 presents estimates of the gain in productive life expec-&#13;
tancy that might be obtained by eliminating various causes of death. These&#13;
values represent increases in the expected length of life between the ages&#13;
of 15 and 65. The table reveals that for populations at the initial life&#13;
expectancy of Africa, a gain of about 4.6 years could be achieved by control-&#13;
ing the medically manageable diseases--respiratory tuberculosis, other&#13;

infectious and parasitic diseases, respiratory infections, and maternal mor-&#13;
tality. It is realistic to assume that half of this potential gain might be&#13;
achieved through an effective health care program. At Asian and Latin&#13;
American initial levels of life expectancy, maximum gains are three to four&#13;
years. In the adult population, chronic and degenerative diseases-e.g.,&#13;
cancer, cardiovascular disease, diseases of the digestive system, and meta-&#13;
bolic diseases--account for loss of about 1.8 years of productive life in&#13;
Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Diarrheal diseases produce a loss of about&#13;
0.2 year in Africa and 0.1 year in the remainder of the developing world.&#13;
It should be recalled that these findings reflect international conditions&#13;
and do some violence to reality in specific countries, especially those in&#13;
extreme climates such as the very dry Sahelian region and the very wet areas&#13;
of South and Southeast Asia.&#13;
Implications of Trends in Health Conditions for National Policy&#13;
It now seems likely that most developing countries will succeed in&#13;
reducing the still very heavy burden of disease only by launching a broad&#13;
program of activities calculated to improve access to essential health care.&#13;
Although the improvements in nutrition, sanitation, and education that accom-&#13;
pany increases in income will reduce morbidity and mortality, these contribu-&#13;
tions by themselves are likely to be modest, at least over the medium term.&#13;
The significant and growing capacities of medical technology to control spe-&#13;
cific disease should be made widely accessible. Immunization, essential drugs,&#13;
maternal and child health care, and management of diarrheal disease, could&#13;
considerably reduce the mortality in developing countries. The fact that these&#13;
technologies can be applied without radical changes in beliefs or culture&#13;
greatly increases the likelihood that they will succeed.&#13;
The diarrheal diseases continue to be a major menace, and have not&#13;
responded readily to public policies. There is no sound, simple preventive&#13;
technology that does not require substantial changes in behavior and, often,&#13;
customs. Improvements in water supplies and waste disposal, although essen-&#13;
tial to reduction of disease, must be accompanied by better hygiene.&#13;
The major challenge to health policy over the next two decades will&#13;
be to improve health in rural areas. As already noted, the early leveling&#13;
off of improvements in health in developing countries is in significant part&#13;
a consequence of failure to provide access to basic health services for rural&#13;
populations. Care should be provided for infectious and parasitic diseases,&#13;
injuries, and maternal and child health; gradual improvements in hygiene,&#13;
nutrition, and health behavior are likely to accompany expanding educatior,&#13;
and rising incomes. Thus, a broad strategy of simple, low-cost health care&#13;
accompanied by gradual improvement of education, nutrition, and sanitation&#13;
appears best adapted to the needs of rural areas. Continued improvement of&#13;
health in urban areas will require expansion of relatively sophisticated care,&#13;
especially for adults.&#13;

The Politics of Improving Access to Health Care&#13;
Efforts to improve access to health care in developing countries&#13;
have encountered resistance from organized medicine and from political elites.&#13;
Organized medicine generally has sought to develop health care programs sim-&#13;
ilar to those in wealthy countries. The rationale for these efforts has been&#13;
that developing countries should strive to achieve international standards&#13;
of care and moreover, that the people of the developing world are entitled&#13;
to services as good as those available anywhere in the world. Political&#13;
elites, on the other hand, have sought to strengthen a sense of nationhood&#13;
and to reduce ethnic and tribal conflicts by offering modern health care first&#13;
to groups of leaders, especially those residing in cities.&#13;
Over the past decade the assumptions of health policy have been&#13;
scrutinized and new approaches to meeting needs for services have been&#13;
advanced. This section considers recent achievements in mobilizing support&#13;
for these innovations. It introduces the concept of primary health care&#13;
(which has become the terminological focus for reference) and examines the&#13;
major issues in health services reform. The section following considers the&#13;
problems in implementing the concept.&#13;
The Concept of Primary Health Care&#13;
Primary health care has emerged as the leading strategy for meeting&#13;
needs in developing countries. It offers the possibility of good access to&#13;
the most cost-effective forms of intervention, even in the poorest countries.&#13;
The term "primary health care" in part replaces the earlier term&#13;
"basic health services" Iut is a much wider concePt. 1/ The ideas for much&#13;
of the new model of care are derived from an assessment of community health&#13;
needs. The approach places emphasis on several activities that are not&#13;
physician-centered, such as health education, preventive activities, family&#13;
health care (including family planning), and use of indigenous health workers.&#13;
Primary health care includes the following elements: (1) commnity partici-&#13;
pation, (2) universal coverage and accessibility, (3) appropriate health&#13;
technologv, and (4) care by community health workers or by traditional health&#13;
workers.  Primary health care is seen as part of a broader system of compre-&#13;
hensive health care including referral and support facilities. 2/&#13;
Primary health care activities consist of immunization against com-&#13;
mon infectious diseases, prenatal care, qualified birth attendance, care of&#13;
newborn and infant children, control of endemic, vector-borne diseases,&#13;
treatment of injuries, and health education. In addition, primary health&#13;
1/ In the vocabulary of WHO the term "primary health care" replaces the&#13;
terms "local health services" and "basic health services" which were&#13;
used by it in the 1960s.&#13;

care includes nonmedical activities such as nutrition education, food forti-&#13;
fication, improvement of storage and distribution of foods, safety education,&#13;
and development of safe water supplies and sanitation. A fully successful&#13;
program of primary health care might be expected to increase life expectancy&#13;
at birth by about 24 years in the poorest regions of Africa and by about 11&#13;
years in the average Asian or Latin American community. Moreover, it would&#13;
prolong productive life, for those in the developing world who survive to&#13;
age 15, by 4 to 9 years.&#13;
A Brief History of Primary Health Care&#13;
The present interest in primary health care follows nearly three&#13;
decades of emphasis on scientific aspects of health care and only marginal&#13;
activity in developing means to increase access to health services. The&#13;
orientation of services to the rural poor in developing countries, however,&#13;
is not new.&#13;
Until the early 1970s development of health care was interpreted&#13;
to mean construction of the medical and paramedical schools, hospitals, and&#13;
health centers that might serve as the settings for delivery of services and&#13;
for training, research, and administration of a national health care system.&#13;
A number of countries sought to stamp out both traditional medicine and&#13;
those forms of modern medicine devised by colonial powers to serve "native"&#13;
populations. Thus, indigenous practitioners, tribal dressers, dispensers,&#13;
and in some countries, medical assistants were outlawed. This broad approach&#13;
to the development of health care paralleled efforts in other sectors char-&#13;
acterized by the now unfashionable "trickledown" strategy of development.&#13;
The emphasis on creation of centers for training and administration was&#13;
partially legitimized by WHO, which promulgated international standards for&#13;
curricula and for staffing in the sector. These standards were widely agreed&#13;
to promise in the long term to meet needs while accommodating the economic&#13;
and technical constraints on health care that had lead earlier to the use of&#13;
dressers, dispensers, and medical assistants.&#13;
The frustration with the trickledown approach to development that&#13;
infected the major productive sectors in the late 1960s reached the health&#13;
field in the early 1970s. Following the lead of rural development, health&#13;
experts and policymakers began to argue that the strategy of building from&#13;
centers of excellence was flawed by its inability to keep pace with popula-&#13;
tion growth and by its unacceptable cost.&#13;
In 1971, WHO and UNICEF established the Joint Committee on Alterna-&#13;
tive Approaches to Meeting Basic Health Needs of Populations in Developing&#13;
Countries. This committee examined the obstacles to providing broad access&#13;
to health care in the developing world and analyzed the experiences of 11&#13;
successful attempts to adapt health care to the needs and resources of low-&#13;
income countries. The report of the committee was submitted to the World&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
Health Assembly in May 1975. 3/ The Assembly directed WHO to seek ways of&#13;
promoting the adoption of new approaches to health care in the member coun-&#13;
tries and proposed an International Conference on Primary Health Care to&#13;
share national experience and to highlight major issues. 4/&#13;
Since 1975 WHO and UNICEF have actively promoted the notion of&#13;
primary health care (PHC) and the reassessment of health priorities and&#13;
policies. National and regional meetings on PHC were scheduled by WHO and&#13;
by other groups interested in health policy in order to develop background&#13;
materials and to scrutinize ideas prior to the International Conference on&#13;
Primary Health Care in 1978. These meetings expanded interest and discussion&#13;
on alternative approaches to meeting health needs and developed the base of&#13;
professional and political support necessary to effect a major shift in&#13;
national health policies. The conference was the largest and most authori-&#13;
tive international meeting on health care ever convened. It was attended by&#13;
representatives of the ministries of health and of finance or planning from&#13;
134 countries. Delegates from 64 United Nations organizations, specialized&#13;
agencies and nongovernmental organizations also participated. The conference&#13;
unanimously adopted the Declaration of Alma Ata, which asserted that health&#13;
is a universal human right and that governments should pursue policies to&#13;
provide accessible, affordable, socially relevant health care to all. 5/&#13;
The Declaration's definition of primary health care stressed the need to&#13;
adopt simple technologies, to promote broad public participation in the&#13;
planning and operation of health care, and to expand the concept of health&#13;
care to include not only personal health services and mass disease control&#13;
but also nutrition, sanitation, water supply, family planning, and health&#13;
and hygiene education.&#13;
Primary health care is founded on the following six political asser-&#13;
tions: first, health is a human right. It is a major goal of development&#13;
as well as an instrument for improving worker productivity and thereby eco-&#13;
nomic growth.&#13;

Second, reduction of morbidity and mortality is at the center of&#13;
development. Health is the major goal of development rather than an instru-&#13;
ment through which productivity may be increased or population growth may&#13;
be retarded. This perspective encourages the holistic approach to health&#13;
embedded in primary health care by underscoring the role of other sectors&#13;
in promoting health and implies the need for multisectoral coordination.&#13;
Third, it is the right and duty of people to participate, indi-&#13;
vidually and collectively, in the planning and implementation of health care.&#13;
This emphasis flows from the conclusion of the UNICEF/WHO Joint Committee&#13;
that broad community participation is a common characteristic of successful&#13;
low-cost health programs.&#13;
Fourth, all activities known to contribute significantly to&#13;
improvements in health are to be examined jointly in formulating health&#13;
plans and policies in order to maximize their cost-effectiveness in terms&#13;
of health.&#13;
Fifth, the major health interventions act synergistically. (These&#13;
synergisms are documented for nutrition and infectious diseases but not yet&#13;
for other combinations of health-determining activities.)&#13;
Sixth, primary health care is affordable and socially acceptable.&#13;
It discourages reliance on advanced western technologies and on highly trained&#13;
professional staff. Instead, it introduces "deprofessionalized" care pro-&#13;
vided by auxiliary workers.&#13;
Organization of Primary Health Care at Village Level&#13;
Primary-health care is targeted nrimarily on the rural and Der&#13;
urban poor. As such, it represents only a modest threat to the economic and&#13;
professional interests of the health professions; demand for their services&#13;
in relatively wealthy, urban areas is likely to continue to outstrip supply&#13;
for some time.  Primary health care may even reduce pressures on organized&#13;
medicine to accept further dictates on their location of practice and fees&#13;
by expanding effective supply in the under-served areas.&#13;
However, the absence of well-developed political mechanisms at the&#13;
village level is also the major obstacle to implementation of primary health&#13;
care. Much of the area to be served has no effective representation from or&#13;
to government.  Thus the administrative machinery for supervising staff and&#13;
monitoring the distribution of materials and supplies does not exist.  Supply&#13;
depots, maintenance facilities, and transport are also lacking. The most&#13;
serious deficiency, however, is the lac  of-a-responsive roca  constituency&#13;
for health care. Because poor communities have received little attention&#13;
from government in the past, they have not yet evolved leadership and organi-&#13;
zations through which to express their priorities or dissatisfaction to&#13;
public officials. Thus programs may not be responsive to needs recognized&#13;
by the community. Moreover, a program may not be accepted as a legitimate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
solution to acknowledged problems, and/or accountability may not be maintained.&#13;
It seems clear that sustained oversight of programs must come from the com-&#13;
munity, since over-the-shoulder formal supervision by the bureaucracy often&#13;
is not practical.&#13;
Implications&#13;
The primary health care movement has developed a broad profes-&#13;
sional and bureaucratic constituency for accessible, low-cost health care.&#13;
The resistance to simplifying health care technology seen earlier among&#13;
the health professions and health bureaucracies has been neutralized, and&#13;
in some instances reversed. Moreover, the very vigorous support of WHO&#13;
and UNICEF has given the movement professional legitimacy.&#13;
The major accomplishment to date has been to influence the politics&#13;
of health in the direction of greater social justice, rather than merely to&#13;
produce a call for greater budget allocations or additional external assis-&#13;
tance to the sector. However, the task of translating the principles of&#13;
primary health care into workable programs of training and service delivery&#13;
has only begun. Almost no effort has been spent in developing strategic&#13;
programs for implementing desirable changes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Operational Issues in Improving Access to Health Care&#13;
Although the technology of simplified medical care has been exten-&#13;
sively tested, the development of institutional arrangements and mechanisms&#13;
to control the quality of services and use of resources is in its infancy. 1/&#13;
The proponents of primary health care have not devised means for coordinat-&#13;
ing the activities of ministries and bureaucracies controlling nutrition,&#13;
education, water supply, sanitation, and occupational safety, nor have they&#13;
succeeded in convincing those outside the health field that the activities&#13;
of these other sectors ought to be evaluated largely (or even solely) in&#13;
terms of their contributions to health. Exploration of the problem of devis-&#13;
ing a suitable mechanism for meeting the recurrent costs of health care is&#13;
only beginning. This section critically examines the operational issues&#13;
associated with some of the core elements of primary health care, and&#13;
reports World Bank experience in dealing with them.&#13;
Integration&#13;
A central tenet of primary health care is that improvements in&#13;
health are produced by such causal factors as nutrition, education, sanita-&#13;
tion, water, occupational safety, personal health care, control of disease&#13;
vectors, and mass immunization. Moreover, the contributions made to health&#13;
by, for example, nutrition education, improvements in the environment, and&#13;
socioeconomic development are asserted to depend upon interventions that are&#13;
simultaneously undertaken; interventions are alleged to have synergistic&#13;
effects. This assertion, if correct, implies that health programming ought&#13;
to be conducted in an integrated manner.&#13;
Health certainly is affected by a wide range of factors. Thus&#13;
synergistic activities undertaken concurrently by several ministries might&#13;
yield greater benefits to health. However, it does not follow that inte-&#13;
gration of field activities is necessary. Those inputs that are separable&#13;
from one another in determining health may be distinguished from those that&#13;
yield significantly greater benefits when jointly employed. In the first&#13;
instance, vector-borne parasitic diseases such as malaria and schistosomia-&#13;
sis can be controlled by destroying the habitat of the vector, applying&#13;
pesticides, or administering drugs to victims or potential victims. Clearly,&#13;
the choice of method to be employed should reflect systematic analysis of&#13;
the costs, benefits, and risks attached to each approach or to combinations&#13;
of approaches, but one approach can be substituted for the other. In the&#13;
second instance, it is argued that interventions produce additional benefits&#13;
if undertaken jointly. For example, bacterial and viral infections increase&#13;
nutritional requirements and in some instances impair absorption of nutrients.&#13;
Moreover, the severity of infectious disease and the efficiency of body&#13;
defenses against an invading parasite are influenced by nutritional status.&#13;
Thus joint efforts to improve nutrition and to prevent and/or treat infectious&#13;
diseases yield significantly greater benefits than these interventions&#13;
introduced individually.&#13;

In practice, however, "integrated" development projects have&#13;
stressed coordination of parallel activities. For example, integrated&#13;
rural development projects have often been characterized by only indirect&#13;
contributions of education, health, family planning, and the like&#13;
to the agricultural component of the project. It seems clear that these&#13;
activities could be undertaken independently without compromising their&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
Intersectoral Coordination&#13;
Following the model of integrated rural development, proponents&#13;
of primary health care advocate an integrated approach to health.2/ More-&#13;
over, the coordination of inputs from other sectors and ministries, it is&#13;
argued, is the responsibility of the ministry of health, given a health-&#13;
centered view of development.&#13;
The presumed need for intersectoral coordination in health arises&#13;
because many of the programs influencing health are controlled by bureau-&#13;
cracies whose primary mandate is not to improve health, but rather to in-&#13;
crease agricultural exports, reduce transportation bottlenecks, produce&#13;
technical manpower, etc. Although, in principle, a comprehensive national&#13;
plan and budget could be formulated that explicitly considers the various&#13;
dimensions of human welfare and national development, as a practical&#13;
matter, plans are devised by agencies with restricted mandates and by tech-&#13;
nical staff of narrow competence. The success of health programs rarely&#13;
hinges on parallel developments in other sectors, except for education&#13;
(training of health manpower) and construction.&#13;
Multisectoral coordination also poses the question of whether&#13;
the lead agency has the capacity and authority to act in such a role.&#13;
Although rooted in the notion that holistic planning is desirable, inte-&#13;
grated development projects typically have been formed from a central core&#13;
project and a number of auxiliary components. The process of coordination&#13;
is orchestrated by the agency responsible for the core, and appraisal of&#13;
the scheme is largely in terms of this agency's primary objectives. The&#13;
ability to achieve coordination and to implement a plan depends critically&#13;
on the overall national priority attached to the agency's mandate.&#13;
Agricultural development has been a political and economic priority in most&#13;
countries, and so ministries of agriculture have been able to secure support&#13;
and to enforce coordination on weaker agencies. In contrast, low-income&#13;
housing has not had such a strong national political constituency, and so&#13;
ministries of housing have generally not had the authority needed to&#13;
coordinate efforts of the ministries of works, education, health, etc.,&#13;
and the social service agencies that were to contribute to integrated low-&#13;
income housing projects.&#13;
2/ For a discussion of the integrated projects approach, see Rural&#13;
Development: Sector Policy Paper, World Bank, February 1975.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
In most countries, ministries of health have a highly fragmented&#13;
constituency, and only modest political support for activities directed toward&#13;
the rural poor. Moreover, they tend to be highly specialized, with little&#13;
or no capacity to assess issues and opportunities outside medicine and&#13;
public health. Thus, the ministry of health is generally ill-suited to act&#13;
as the coordinator in projects.&#13;
Furthermore, although health goals are influenced by the activi-&#13;
ties of other sectors, the effects are modest relative to the primary&#13;
thrust of these activities. Thus, health considerations are likely to&#13;
continue to play a minor role in the design of development projects. The&#13;
most constructive contribution of the health sector, therefore, is not to&#13;
coordinate but to utilize and actively support opportunities created by&#13;
development in other sectors.&#13;
Role of Health Components of Projects in Other Sectors&#13;
The World Bank's experience with health components illustrates&#13;
the above. The Bank has not financed health projects as such, but rather&#13;
has included health components in agriculture, rural development, and urban&#13;
projects. Thus, it has not been involved in coordinating and integrating&#13;
the activities of other sectors through ministries of health.&#13;
Bank experiences show that the technical need for integration has&#13;
been only one consideration in determining whether to include health&#13;
components in projects. Since 1971, only about five percent of all Bank&#13;
projects have contained health components. About 40 percent of components&#13;
have been introduced to prevent negative health effects of development&#13;
projects, in particular to contain the spread or assist the control of&#13;
endemic or epidemic diseases. Another 15 percent of components have pro-&#13;
vided basic health services in resettlement projects or projects with&#13;
migration elements. Health manpower components of education projects have&#13;
served more direct needs. Only 30 percent of components were designed to&#13;
integrate health into regional development, rural development, agriculture,&#13;
and urban projects.&#13;
Health components of rural development projects have commonly&#13;
been designed to provide better access to and better quality of health&#13;
services as a contribution to integrated rural development. Although&#13;
ministries of health have often been enthusiastic about participating in&#13;
these projects (and in the attached financing), minor problems of coordina-&#13;
tion have often occurred. These problems, however, have normally reflected&#13;
the lack of familiarity of health agencies with the procedures and concepts&#13;
of the other cooperating agencies, and the absence of regular, organized&#13;
communication between agencies. These coordination problems have been less&#13;
serious on district levels than on provincial or national levels and&#13;
gradually are being overcome. Serious coordination problems also have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
occurred between departments within ministries of health. Sometimes&#13;
planning units have claimed responsibility not only for preparing a compo-&#13;
nent but also for executing it, although this is not their normal, insti-&#13;
tutional mandate. Intraministerial competition for different elements of&#13;
a component has also occurred, particularly where responsibility for&#13;
preventive and curative services is split. In summary, Bank experience&#13;
shows that health institutions are interested and quite successful in&#13;
participating in development projects, but often have limited capacity&#13;
initially to coordinate activities and to respond to other institutions.&#13;
Community Participation&#13;
The joint UNICEF/WHO study of alternative approaches to meeting&#13;
basic health care needs noted that successful, simplified health care&#13;
programs were characterized by extensive community participation.4/&#13;
Community participation may assume a variety of forms. Some communities&#13;
have contributed a significant share of the cost of a vehicle or building&#13;
for the new health facilities. Others have organized themselves to demand&#13;
a health facility from government and have established goals and standards&#13;
for programs. A few communities have set up oversight committees to review&#13;
and control performance of the local health worker and to account for&#13;
supplies and fees. Other villages have developed either local insurance&#13;
plans or cooperative arrangements for staff and/or for financing recurrent&#13;
costs. Finally, some villages have organized parallel activities, includ-&#13;
ing well-digging, drug distribution, latrine construction, and gardening.5/&#13;
Community participation is significant in several ways. From the&#13;
point of view of the ministry of health, local participation is a device for&#13;
mobilizing additional economic resources. Locally, self-reliant health&#13;
care is also attractive because it reduces the dependency of rural areas&#13;
on periodic budget allocations from central or regional government. Commu-&#13;
nity construction of a facility and housing presumably has the additional&#13;
benefit of encouraging the use of local materials, thus limiting costs.&#13;
Local participation in the design and oversight of a health care program&#13;
may be expected to increase acceptability and thus utilization; perceived&#13;
needs are more likely to be stressed, and the style of operation is more&#13;
likely to be in harmony with local customs.&#13;

Basic Health Needs in Developing Countries, World Health Organization,&#13;

5/ Health components financed by the Bank have included elements of&#13;
community participation. In twenty-two components, fourteen of which&#13;
were in Latin America, beneficiaries provided labor; in nine projects,&#13;
material or land was contributed in addition. Six projects used local&#13;
insurance mechanisms, and seven introduced fee-for-service systems of&#13;
local finance. From OEHA Activities in Health, 1971-79 (World Bank&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
Perhaps most important, local participation signifies that the&#13;
community places a high priority on the program. Wherever communities have&#13;
spontaneously organized themselves, gathered resources, and initiated&#13;
activities, one may be assured of considerable interest and commitment.&#13;
Thus, it may be argued that community participation is more a political&#13;
than an economic asset. It generally means there is a consensus on the&#13;
importance of health activities; it legitimizes the approach to be taken,&#13;
and leads to a demand for accountability both from higher levels of govern-&#13;
ment and from local health workers.&#13;
The critical issue is how to promote community participation&#13;
where it has not yet appeared spontaneously. Although one can easily&#13;
demand that a village health committee be formed or that the community&#13;
contribute labor and materials for a construction project, it is difficult&#13;
to achieve a genuine sense of local proprietorship. Thinking on community&#13;
participation is still primitive. Little attention has been given to the&#13;
relationship between traditional ways of dealing with health problems, local.&#13;
resources, culture, beliefs, competing priorities, and the manner in which&#13;
participation is developed. Furthermore, community participation is often&#13;
subverted by elites who demand contributions of labor and materials from&#13;
the weak and poor; the benefits of local self-help schemes are often seized&#13;
by the more powerful members of the community. The spokespersons for the&#13;
community may be self-appointed, or chosen for their superior education or&#13;
capacity for dealing with outsiders; such people may, however, lack ability&#13;
to identify local needs and aspirations, or to legitimize new approaches to&#13;
problems.&#13;
World Bank experience suggests that the broad, genuine community&#13;
participation needed to ensure successful implementation of the concept of&#13;
primary health care cannot be easily or quickly created. Where local&#13;
organizations or traditions of cooperative village activity already exist,&#13;
community participation in health programs may be established more readily.&#13;
The central issue is not local involvement in decision-making or local&#13;
contributions of inputs, but rather, development of a commitment to and&#13;
acceptance of the new scheme. This implies that primary attention should be&#13;
paid to strengthening the credibility of and support for local organizations.&#13;
They should be encouraged to gain experience and authority by dealing with&#13;
issues of high priority to the community in order to establish their ability&#13;
to meet community needs. Specific health care activities and programs&#13;
should be selected initially for their contribution to strengthening these&#13;
local institutions.&#13;
Community Health Workers-/&#13;
For many developing countries, the most realistic solution for&#13;
attaining total coverage with essential health care is to employ community&#13;
health workers who can be trained in a short time to perform basic tasks.&#13;
6/ This discussion draws on Bank findings noted in: Health Sector&#13;
Policy Paper, World Bank, February 1980, Chapter 5.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
These are people with limited education, often selected by the communities&#13;
they serve, and trained briefly, nearby. Community health workers are also&#13;
known as barefoot doctors, village health workers, dispensers, or medical&#13;
assistants.&#13;
Experience shows that village health workers can be adequately&#13;
trained at low cost. Over the past few years, considerable advances have&#13;
been made by national ministries and academic institutions in simplifying&#13;
procedures for the diagnosis and treatment of common diseases; the use of&#13;
oral rehydration for the treatment of diarrhea is a striking example.&#13;
Training programs of four to six weeks' duration have been provided success-&#13;
fully in Niger, Colombia, Indonesia, and several other countries. Candi-&#13;
dates have been selected from community members in the 16-30 age brackets&#13;
with basic literacy skills. In several instances, traditional health&#13;
workers have been given additional training in midwifery.&#13;
It has proved useful to recruit community health workers from the&#13;
areas they are expected to serve. Cultural differences among racial and&#13;
ethnic groups and variations in beliefs regarding disease argue strongly&#13;
against assigning workers to unfamiliar settings. Furthermore, health&#13;
workers are likely to be retained longer if they are recruited locally.&#13;
Distortion of the selection process should be guarded against.&#13;
The selection committee sometimes is unrepresentative or is motivated by&#13;
political considerations. Recruiting workers who are sensitive to the&#13;
needs of the poorest and most deprived is especially difficult. Community&#13;
selection is least likely to succeed if the position of village health&#13;
worker is remunerative or provides valuable in-kind benefits such as travel.&#13;
Individuals applying for the job may be more highly motivated and capable&#13;
than village nominees, but often lack the confidence and support of the&#13;
village.&#13;
In conventional, physician-dominated health institutions, continu-&#13;
ing education, review of performance, and reinforcement are provided through&#13;
frequent, informal contacts with other health workers. The isolated village-&#13;
level worker does not, of course, have these contacts, and, thus, explicit&#13;
mechanisms for supervision and technical support must be established.&#13;
Experience has shown the need for continuing education and on-the-job train-&#13;
ing of village health workers through informal contacts with other health&#13;
workers. These requirements appear to be fulfilled most successfully&#13;
through integration of village health care into a network of health care&#13;
facilities, and through routine referral of patients. Full-time supervisors&#13;
who are well-trained but who have had no field experience have tended to be&#13;
ineffective. Persons with recent experience in dealing with similar problems,&#13;
because of their greater credibility and empathy, have been more successful&#13;
as educators, motivators, and supervisors than those trained as supervisors&#13;
and managers.&#13;

The role of part-time or volunteer community health workers has&#13;
been a controversial issue. Some countries, such as Indonesia, have in&#13;
limited experiments achieved favorable results with volunteer workers;&#13;
however, these models do not seem to be replicable on a large scale.&#13;
Furthermore, the long-term feasibility of such an approach seems doubtful;&#13;
no other sector has succeeded in employing volunteer workers on a large&#13;
scale who must work together with civil servants.&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
In summary, international experience in the primary health care&#13;
movement, as well as the experience with health components in World Bank-&#13;
financed development projects, clearly demonstrates the technical feasibility&#13;
of highly simplified health care systems. It is possible to generate&#13;
community participation. It is also possible to identify suitable candidates&#13;
for the role of community health workers, and to train them to manage common&#13;
health problems and to provide education in health, nutrition, and sanita-&#13;
tion. Assessment of the clinical and interpersonal skill of these trainees&#13;
suggests that community health workers are as well prepared to respond to&#13;
common health care needs as are professional health workers.&#13;
Though the technical feasibility of low-cost, community-based&#13;
health care is well established, there have not been successful large-scale&#13;
programs for rural or low-income urban populations. Those schemes that&#13;
have succeeded have often been small in scale and closely supervised by&#13;
their developers. The problems that must be anticipated in large-scale&#13;
programs result primarily from breakdowns in management and logistics. This&#13;
may be due to inadequate financing, transport failures, or lack of personnel&#13;
and inventory management. Problems may also result from lack of continuing&#13;
education and inadequately executed administrative and technical supervi-&#13;
sion. Supporting activities such as logistics of supplies, appropriate&#13;
management, and the quality of supervision are critically important. The&#13;
discrepancy between the promises and achievements of low-cost rural health&#13;
care result primarily from inadequate management, and this is a consequence&#13;
of underdeveloped administrative machinery and lack of organization among&#13;
client populations.&#13;

Institutionalization and Management of Primary Health Care&#13;
Institutional Resources for Rural Health Care&#13;
Health care activities must be conceived, organized, and operated&#13;
by institutions with sufficient competence and authority to identify needs&#13;
and to guide the use of resources. Although this view is readily accepted&#13;
by health experts, it has not seized their attention. The incongruence&#13;
between the capacities of institutions that now exist in developing countries,&#13;
and the administrative requirements of low-cost, simple technologies, have&#13;
not been widely recognized.&#13;
Health care activities are supported and guided by both informal&#13;
and formal organizations. Informal organizations are those groups of clients&#13;
who organize themselves to articulate the priorities of the community, to&#13;
express discontent with the availability or quality of services, and to&#13;
mobilize local resources. Village organizations are sometimes created in&#13;
response to specific problems and remain in existence only until the issue&#13;
has been resolved. The village committee that dissolves after the local&#13;
health post has been constructed is an example. Frequently, the local&#13;
organization of health care is carried out by groups established to pursue&#13;
other objectives. Examples include agricultural marketing or processing&#13;
cooperatives, women's clubs, labor unions, or local units of the political&#13;
party. Religious organizations, in part because of their authority and&#13;
concern for suffering and life, have been particularly effective as informal&#13;
local health organizations. Marketing cooperatives -- perhaps because they&#13;
are organized to promote local interests against those of the modern,&#13;
external sector and have achieved acceptance -- have been especially&#13;
successful. In most instances, however, community organizations to promote&#13;
rural health do not exist or are too weak to contribute significantly to&#13;
the development, management, and financing of health programs. Village&#13;
health committees have also been created by primary health care projects.&#13;
To be effective, these local groups of clients must be able to identify&#13;
issues and to express positions forcefully to responsible authorities. Most&#13;
have lacked broad community support and, hence, have not achieved legitimacy&#13;
as local organizations.&#13;
The formal organization guiding and supporting rural health care&#13;
is normally the ministry of health and its component agencies. Organized&#13;
professional medicine sometimes is also a major force. In Latin America,&#13;
particularly, social insurance schemes assume major responsibility for&#13;
providing curative services.l/ There are also specialized agencies created&#13;
to provide health care to sub-groups such as the military or senior civil&#13;
servants.2/&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

Practically all of these organizations are governmental or para-&#13;
governmental bureaucracies. They are generally weak. Ministries of health&#13;
in developing countries typically are staffed by health care professionals&#13;
rather than professional administrators. This pattern of staffing, although&#13;
partially justified by the needs of a highly technical bureaucracy, cannot&#13;
adequately operate systems of health care that rely heavily on paraprofes-&#13;
sionals functioning in isolated communities. In addition, few ministries of&#13;
health employ financial analysts or economists. Generalists and management&#13;
experts in the civil service rarely perceive ministries of health as offer-&#13;
ing attractive career opportunities.    Furthermore, the unit responsible&#13;
for rural health programs is often among the weakest in the health ministry.&#13;
It is least able to attract competent staff or to achieve continuity in its&#13;
operations, because the work is regarded as unglamorous, and because of the&#13;
hardships of being posted in rural areas.&#13;
The greatest dPfJcrPncies in the administrative structure are at&#13;
the local level. Health bureaucracies seldom have well-established, func-&#13;
tioning institutions at the county or district level that might provide&#13;
guidance, technical supervision, and control. Rural district hospitals are&#13;
generally the lowest level at which the health bureaucracy functions effec-&#13;
tively, and then only in providing clinical services rather than offering&#13;
administrative support to field staff. Moreover, the general government&#13;
administration is typically underdeveloped in low-income, rural areas, and&#13;
thus cannot easily supplement resources of the ministry of health.&#13;
In some countries, administrative responsibility for local or&#13;
district services does not reside with the ministry of health, but rather&#13;
with the ministry of local government or the territorial administration.&#13;
This often further weakens local health administration.&#13;
The capacity of ministries of health to provide fresh leadership&#13;
for new programs is constrained by rigid civil service rules established by&#13;
a public service commission. These procedures often permit very little&#13;
flexibility in rewarding performance, effecting transfers, or modifying&#13;
incentives; instead, they stress such factors as formal qualifications,&#13;
credentials, and longevity in determining the use and compensation of staff.&#13;
Civil service rules generally apply uniformly to all sectors and are&#13;
difficult to tailor to the specific needs of a particular sector, especially&#13;
highly technical sectors such as health.&#13;
Management Tasks&#13;
Implementation of low-cost rural primary health care confronts&#13;
bureaucracies with new administrative challenges -- tasks that, applied to&#13;
a system of scattered, deprofessionalized care, are not only different in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
scale but also in character. The health bureaucracy must carry out six&#13;
major functions. Four of these have been classically identified --&#13;
personnel administration, logistics of supply, quality assurance, and&#13;
finance. The fifth arises from efforts to reach previously unserved&#13;
groups: building community organizations with capacity for recognizing&#13;
and responding to the needs of inarticulate clients, and establishing&#13;
highly adaptive institutions.&#13;
Personnel Administration. Primary health care requires that at least one&#13;
new health cadre be established, and perhaps integrated into the civil&#13;
service. The community health worker is an auxiliary with little profes-&#13;
sional autonomy and no immediate peer review to regulate his performance&#13;
and conduct. Thus, selection procedures should be based on potential&#13;
performance, community acceptance, and aptitude for training; formal skills&#13;
and credentials generally are not relevant. The selection process must be&#13;
protected against manipulation by local elites, political considerations,&#13;
and nepotism, common problems in many rural health schemes. Training must&#13;
be continuous and, hence, is an essential part of supervision. Training&#13;
materials must be adapted to the education and beliefs of the trainees.&#13;
Community health workers must be motivated to continue in the&#13;
role. A number of countries have attempted to place the community health&#13;
worker outside the formalities of the civil service 3/ or even to use&#13;
voluntary workers -- but these measures have sometimes been frustrated&#13;
by unrest and poor morale. On the other hand, if the community health&#13;
worker is integrated into the civil service, his or her credentials and&#13;
qualifications must be formalized and embedded in civil service regulations.&#13;
Tenure, opportunities for advancement, and entitlement to benefits must be&#13;
established; these are especially thorny issues in relation to locally&#13;
recruited, part-time health workers whose efforts necessarily vary widely&#13;
from community to community.&#13;
Logistics of Supply. The second major challenge is to procure and distrib-&#13;
ute drugs and medical supplies in a timely and efficient manner. This task&#13;
is especially crucial because the credibility of the community health worker&#13;
often hinges on his ability to meet the expectations of clients. Ministries&#13;
of health generally do not have the network of stores, vehicles, or mainten-&#13;
ance facilities needed to serve scattered communities. Many health bureau-&#13;
cracies have not yet developed procurement procedures and inventory manage-&#13;
ment systems to ensure the continuous availability of drugs and supplies.&#13;
3/ India is an example. The community health worker is supposed to be&#13;
supported by the community, with only logistic links to the health&#13;
care system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
Cooperatives and commercial distributors of drugs and supplies, such as&#13;
the village pharmacies of some West African countries, may be enlisted to&#13;
exploit the administrative capacities of non-governmental institutions.&#13;
But promotion of these responsibilities will generally require considerable&#13;
initial effort by government officials.&#13;
Quality Assurance. Deprofessionalization of health care escalates the&#13;
importance of supervising technical performance and monitoring utilization&#13;
of health care. Health workers who have not been extensively conditioned&#13;
into the role and sensitized to peer pressures are particularly likely to&#13;
perform inadequately. Traditional beliefs about disease and health care,&#13;
which are typical of rural areas, further complicate the task of health&#13;
workers.&#13;
Mobilization of Financial Resources. Although the new health care technolo-&#13;
gies have much lower unit costs than conventional approaches, the total&#13;
budgetary commitment to health must, nonetheless, be substantially increased.&#13;
Existing health care programs, no matter how inappropriate, rarely can be&#13;
discontinued, so additional resources must be found. This requires that&#13;
the health bureaucracy prepare convincing budget presentations stressing&#13;
low-cost technologies and improved access to care -- subjects about which&#13;
the existing bureaucracies frequently know little, and to which they may&#13;
have only modest commitment. Moreover, the political authorities to whom&#13;
the presentations are addressed often have conservative views about health&#13;
care.&#13;
A number of observers have urged that local self-help be used to&#13;
finance rural primary health care. However, this requires that government&#13;
health authorities develop the necessary local organizations. Furthermore,&#13;
local financing raises problems of accountability for substantial sums of&#13;
money by large numbers of dispersed organizations over which governments&#13;
rarely have effective control. Local self-help also works systematically&#13;
against the poorest communities.&#13;
Building Community Organizations. Because rural health services must&#13;
necessarily be provided through highly dispersed facilities and by auxiliary&#13;
staff, continuous supervision is both essential and difficult. Organized&#13;
(formal or informal) consumer groups, so-called "informed publics", can&#13;
provide oversight, especially of timely performance of duties and accounta-&#13;
bility for resources.&#13;
To be effective, local interest groups must be sufficiently&#13;
organized and articulate to influence government officials. This requires&#13;
building an informed public and effective leadership -- an entirely new task&#13;
for most health bureaucracies. In addition, strengthening local organiza-&#13;
tions often requires delegation of responsibilities and provision of funds&#13;
to carry out prescribed tasks; yet government agencies are frequently&#13;
prohibited by law or regulations from offering such assistance. Where local&#13;
organizations have been installed by ministries of health, long-term viabil-&#13;
ity has emerged as a problem. Frequently, these entities have collapsed&#13;
because the community has seen them to be ineffective.&#13;
&#13;

The Village Family Planning Program in Indonesia illustrates the&#13;
development of a local constituency for health activities.4/ The Village&#13;
Family Planning Program began in late 1974, as a small pilot project in West&#13;
Java to test the feasibility of using local communities as contraceptive&#13;
resupply points. The project proved the feasibility of village resupply,&#13;
and from fifty such depots in late 1974, the program expanded rapidly in&#13;
three years to include 20,000 village depots and 60,000 family planning&#13;
groups. Contraceptives are sent from the clinic to the village depot. The&#13;
depot is either in a villager's home or a village administrative office,&#13;
and is run by a village volunteer who is usually a satisfied client of the&#13;
family planning program, or a member of the village administration staff.&#13;
A family planning fieldworker plays an important role in linking the clinic&#13;
with the village, and in making supplies available to ensure that contra-&#13;
ceptives are on hand for eligible couples. Each family planning group is&#13;
led by a woman who is responsible for ensuring that her members are&#13;
resupplied with pills and condoms. She also acts as a reference point for&#13;
women with questions or complaints, and may refer women to the clinic.&#13;
The family planning fieldworkers, who are temporary government&#13;
employees, have been effective in providing limited and specific services.&#13;
The consistency and regularity of contact with village groups and committees&#13;
have been the most important factors in developing and maintaining a well-&#13;
organized, motivated community organization. As the program has become&#13;
established, interest in other health-related services has increased, for&#13;
example, in nutrition and emergency health care.&#13;
The most significant outcome of this program is that it has&#13;
tended to make family planning a village-oriented, rather than a clinic-&#13;
oriented, activity, thus transferring some of the responsibility for&#13;
managing and implementing services from the government to the community.&#13;
Although there are a number of ways to build a local constituency,&#13;
perhaps the most important approach is to ensure that new health programs&#13;
are responsive to locally perceived needs. Health programs may be classi-&#13;
fied into popular and unpopular programs. Although water supply, maternal&#13;
and child care, and curative services are commonly perceived to be valuable,&#13;
sanitation, health education, and preventive programs are not particularly&#13;
popular and are rarely considered important by the beneficiaries. Thus,&#13;
these latter activities are unsuitable for strengthening local response.&#13;
Priority should be placed on strengthening those community&#13;
organizations which support local initiatives. For example, governments&#13;
may offer grants-in-aid to groups that organize efforts to construct facili-&#13;
ties or mobilize local labor. To be effective, these grants must be&#13;
matched with enthusiasm from an organized interest group. It is important&#13;
to develop capacity within such groups both for identifying local priori-&#13;
ties, and for expressing their importance to political authorities and the&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
formal bureaucracy. Another option is to encourage existing community&#13;
organizations with effective and articulate leadership to assume oversight&#13;
responsibility for local health activities.&#13;
Community organizations are not likely to develop rapidly or to&#13;
be entirely effective. But without local institutions or an informed&#13;
public capable of demanding a minimum level of performance from the rural&#13;
health care system, there is little hope for its long-term success.&#13;
Strengthening Institutional Capacity&#13;
Low-cost rural health activities require a complex and sophisticated&#13;
administrative superstructure, and new procedures for delivery of supplies,&#13;
personnel management, utilization and quality control, institution-building,&#13;
marketing, and monitoring. They require an administration-intensive approach&#13;
different from present admiinistrative patterns.&#13;
Strengthening the Formal Bureaucracy&#13;
Efforts to increase the capacity of the formal bureaucracy can be&#13;
introduced at several stages in the development of a program. At the design&#13;
stage, the management capacity of the ministry of health should be assessed.&#13;
Particular attention should be paid to the past performance of its rural&#13;
health unit, especially in very remote areas of the country. Insights into&#13;
the capacities of the unit can often be obtained from an analysis of training&#13;
programs, personnel management, and budgeting. These three activities most&#13;
clearly reveal the priorities of the unit and its ability to initiate and&#13;
operate new programs. Such an analysis also provides a sense for the level&#13;
of bureaucratic development, the weaknesses in staffing, the extent to which&#13;
standard procedures have been established, and the ability of the unit to&#13;
effect changes. From this assessment, one can identify needs for training&#13;
staff, strengthening communications between center and periphery, formalizing&#13;
procedures, and improving communications with field staff.&#13;
During tAie implementation phase, the ministry must mobilize new&#13;
resources, issue tenders and evaluate bids, award contracts, supervise&#13;
construction activities, devise curricula, recruit personnel, initiate&#13;
training, and establish operating and personnel policies. Commonly, a&#13;
special project management unit (PHU) is established to expedite these&#13;
activities. It is allowed to recruit staff outside civil service regula-&#13;
tions and often is granted exceptional authority to make contracts. The&#13;
PMU, however, frequently attracts the best administrative talent from the&#13;
ministry of health, thereby impoverishing the ministry. Later attempts to&#13;
reintegrate the staff of a PHU into the formal bureaucracy are often&#13;
unsuccessful. Thus, the PTMU concept should be used sparingly and only for&#13;
programs of limited duration.&#13;
If, instead, a new program is implemented through the regular line&#13;
departments in the health institutions, considerable opportunity emerges&#13;
for introducing new techniques or strengthening existing standard operating&#13;
procedures. This is particularly important for health bureaucracies, since&#13;
they are often not familiar with procedures used in other institutions in&#13;
dealing, for example, with construction, logistics, procurement, and&#13;
personnel management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
During the operational phase, machinery should be created to&#13;
monitor continuously not only field operations but also the performance of&#13;
management. The usefulness of activity reports, clinical records, and&#13;
supervision activities should be carefully scrutinized. These functions&#13;
absorb considerable staff time, and are likely to engender cynicism toward&#13;
the management system if they do not contribute directly to the performance&#13;
of clinical activities.&#13;
Although these concepts are commonly applied in business enter-&#13;
prises,5/ they are not often used by public managers, whose decisions are&#13;
constrained in peculiar ways by civil service rules and other considera-&#13;
tions. Nonetheless, within these constraints, possibilities of introducing&#13;
problem-oriented management are available. For example, it is possible to&#13;
shift the focus of supervision of local health workers from administrative&#13;
control to training and facilitating.&#13;
More radical changes necessary to introduce problem-oriented&#13;
management or to increase organizational flexibility and learning capacity&#13;
would require major administrative reforms. However, these reforms are&#13;
often not feasible or even advisable, since they have a destabilizing&#13;
effect. But there are options for marginal changes, particularly in the&#13;
areas of supervision and logistics. Exploiting these might lead, as the&#13;
case of Indonesia shows, to increased community response.&#13;
Project Concepts&#13;
Projects should conserve administrative capacity. Wholesale intro-&#13;
duction of innovations not only overwhelms the implementation capabilities&#13;
of the ministry of health but also frequently exceeds the ability of villag-&#13;
ers to accommodate change. Thus, a strategy for change should be devised&#13;
that gradually develops operating capacities. Relatively simple activities,&#13;
sometimes only of modest public health importance, should be introduced&#13;
first, with gradual expansion of the range of services. In addition,&#13;
flexibility is needed during project implementation. The weakness of plan-&#13;
ning tools, uncertainty about problems, social structure, unpredictability&#13;
of administrative capacity, and political change will often require devia-&#13;
tions from a prescribed plan. Thus, the plan should provide for these&#13;
contingencies.&#13;
The complexity of a project has major implications for administra-&#13;
tive capacity. In general, projects should be as simple as possible. How-&#13;
ever, it appears that each individual project should represent a balanced&#13;
portfolio of technical risk, financial commitments, and political conse-&#13;
quences. In the health sector, the controversy over the desirability of&#13;
integration has focused on the issue of whether to develop vertical&#13;
(single-disease) programs or horizontal programs dealing simultaneously&#13;

with a number of health problems.6/ Although relatively simple single-&#13;
disease intervention programs have proved to be effective, at the field&#13;
level they have also demonstrated the problems of centralized line opera-&#13;
tions in terms of rigidity, and the excessive costs of coordination&#13;
attached to them. On the other hand, highly integrated approaches have&#13;
led to the complex coordination problems outlined earlier.&#13;

Financing Health Care&#13;
As noted earlier, substantial amounts are being spent by govern-&#13;
ments, voluntary organizations, and individuals to promote health. Our&#13;
analyses suggest that, in most countries, a basic program of health care&#13;
could be provided to everyone with no additional expenditure. There are&#13;
serious obstacles, however, to such a reallocation of funds. Even so, the&#13;
growth in aggregate incomes in the developing countries and the high-income&#13;
elasticity of demand for health may be expected to yield very significant&#13;
additions to expenditures for health care. Much of this spending could be&#13;
allocated to achieve broad access to care with little sacrifice of the&#13;
interests of those segments of the population that are now better served.&#13;
Financial Requirements&#13;
The experiences of the World Bank suggest that development cost&#13;
of providing basic health care to those not now served is US$10-12 billion.&#13;
This investment would provide prenatal care, trained midwifery, childhood&#13;
immunization, treatment of injuries, control of endemic disease (e.g.,&#13;
vector control, suppressive drug treatment, radical curative treatment,&#13;
and/or immunization), and health education. Population growth between 1980&#13;
and the year 2000 will add 1.4 to 1.6 billion people to the ranks of the&#13;
underserved, and will thus require an additional investment of approximately&#13;
US$10 billion (in 1980 dollars), beginning with annual outlays of US$400&#13;
million in the early 1980s and increasing to about US$1 billion a year by&#13;
2000. In addition, annual operating costs must increase by about US$6&#13;
billion a year in the early 1980s, rising to perhaps US$18 billion a year&#13;
over 1980 levels by the year 2000. The development budget for health&#13;
(including health manpower training) is now on the order of US$2 billion a&#13;
year for the developing countries, excluding China. Their operating budgets&#13;
for health are about US$17.5 billion a year in total.l/ Total spending --&#13;
for development and operation of public systems and for direct and indirect&#13;
private expenditures -- is about US$70 billion a year.&#13;
Over the next two decades, total expenditures for health care in&#13;
developing countries may be expected to more than quadruple. Thus, one may&#13;
realistically expect that an additional US$200 billion will be spent annually&#13;
for health care in the now-developing countries at the end of the century.&#13;
Hence, even assuming that the sector will not reallocate resources away&#13;
from existing programs, there are substantial opportunities to modify health&#13;
programs.&#13;
Present Methods of Health Care Finance&#13;
Two approaches to financing health care are employed by developing&#13;
countries. In the overwhelming majority of developing countries, govern-&#13;
ments produce and distribute modern, western-type health care. Those&#13;
1/ WHO, World Health Statistics - Resources, 1978&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
countries that attained political independence during the 1960s have been&#13;
almost unanimous in adopting policies of public provision of care as a&#13;
human right. A second group of countries -- especially the middle-income&#13;
nations of Latin America and Asia -- have until recently operated only&#13;
modest publicly financed health care programs; most services are produced&#13;
by physician-entrepreneurs. These countries are now creating social insur-&#13;
ance programs in order to reduce economic barriers to health care, as well&#13;
as to provide disability and retirement benefits. In Latin America,&#13;
coverage under social insurance programs has increased substantially over&#13;
the past decade. Such expansion has been motivated by mounting awareness&#13;
of the political need to build constituencies among the poor, and by adop-&#13;
tion of European notions of a welfare state. The social insurance approach&#13;
to health care finance has been most attractive to countries with well-&#13;
established, private health sectors. The goal of social insurance is not&#13;
so much to develop the health sector as to improve access to existing&#13;
services reflecting the political significance of established health care&#13;
institutions. Social insurance programs often have been devised for&#13;
limited clienteles such as industrial workers, migrant farm workers, and&#13;
civil service employees. Programs also have been created to promote nutri-&#13;
tion, personal health services, disability benefits, etc., so that over-&#13;
lapping and conflicting programs have emerged in many countries.&#13;
Despite the growth of public financing, a substantial private&#13;
sector coexists with publicly financed programs in all countries. This&#13;
reflects the fact that access to government-sponsored or government-&#13;
financed health care facilities remains unsatisfactory, even in countries&#13;
with strong political commitment to public provision of health care. Espe-&#13;
cially in rural areas, traditional indigenous practitioners provide a large&#13;
proportion of care. In some countries -- especially in Africa and South&#13;
Asia -- private voluntary organizations are prominent sources of care.&#13;
Psychosocial disorders often are presented to indigenous health workers&#13;
whose superior effectiveness has been demonstrated, even where western&#13;
services are readily available.&#13;
Alternative Devices for Financing Health Care&#13;
The manner in which health care is financed determines both how&#13;
much it will cost and who has access to services. Moreover, some financing&#13;
mechanisms provide more reliable revenues, thereby facilitating long-run&#13;
planning and assuring continuity of programs.&#13;
The use of prices and markets to allocate health care is gener-&#13;
ally not desirable.  First, incomes are not distributed in the same ways as&#13;
the need for health care. Women and children, who frequently have little&#13;
control over family budgets, are usually most in need of care. However,&#13;
their lack of economic power limits their ability to purchase basic&#13;
services. Furthermore, the very poor, because of their lack of adequate&#13;
shelter, nutrition and sanitation, often need health care most. Second,&#13;
even where income distribution is not a problem, most consumers are not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
well qualified to select health services. Thus, prices are not a reasonable&#13;
basoaine.   The inability of consumers to make sound choices reflects&#13;
the compleanrLrhejr lnr-k  f experiec  in sele&#13;
evaluating such services. Third, much health care is chosen by adults for&#13;
chiren opsonstoo ill to make their own determinations of need.  Thus,&#13;
market-type choices are suspect unless the interests of the beneficiary and&#13;
decision-maker are harmonious. Fourth, health care activities often benefit&#13;
entire cmmimun,ti;R  irather than only the individual who seeks care.  Most&#13;
obviously, control of highly communicable diseases reduces the threat to&#13;
others of infection; the eradication of smallpox is the most dramatic&#13;
example of the external benefits of disease control activities. However,&#13;
health care activities also confer benefits on the community by simply&#13;
being available to deal with an accident or outbreak of disease. This&#13;
general community benefit is not adequately measured by purchases of services&#13;
or the amount paid by clients of the health care system. Fifth, the health&#13;
crises that stimulate use of health services are random and often cata-&#13;
strophic.  Thus, in lvi uause olds generally are unable to budget&#13;
adequately for health care and some form of insurance or risk-sharing is&#13;
needed.&#13;
Two broad approaches to the problems of risk-sharing and financing&#13;
are available. In countries with developed private health care systems,&#13;
insurance schemes have emerged that pool the financial risks of illness.&#13;
These sc emes purchase services from private providers of care, usually on&#13;
a fee-for-service basis. The health insurance scheme may be organized by a&#13;
national or local government or may be developed by private associations or&#13;
employers, labor unions, or insurance companies. In a number of countries,&#13;
broad social insurance programs covering long-term disability, retirement,&#13;
and unemployment have been introduced. This indirect approach to financing&#13;
health care -- relying on private providers of care and financed by public&#13;
or semi-public mechanisms -- is in large part a reflection of an existing&#13;
large private system of health care.&#13;
The purpose of health insurance is to reduce economic barriers to&#13;
care by spreading costs among the members of the insurance group.  The most&#13;
primitive insurance scheme is the sickness club popul            stern Europe&#13;
at the turn of the century. The sickness club is organized locally, often&#13;
around an existing organization such as a religious community or farmers'&#13;
union. It collects annual dues, and supplements, if funds are inadequate,&#13;
from all members. Members are then entitled to assistance in paying for&#13;
medical care. A more complex version of the sickness club is often found&#13;
in industry, where the labor union or employer provides coverage for all the&#13;
workers in a factory, firm, or industry. Insurance contributions are&#13;
collected periodically, on ar actuarial basis to ensure adequate reserves.&#13;
Management of such a plan is often assumed by a private insurance firm.&#13;
These schemes often are compulsory for all eligible persons. Voluntary&#13;
insurance programs preclude significant risk-sharing. Since persons who&#13;
are in higher risk of serious disease benefit more than others, there is a&#13;
systematic, destabilizing effect in voluntary enrollment. Those who are at&#13;
relatively low risi  Haveincentives to withdraw from--the scheme and/or to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
form another group. For example, early attempts by Korea to establish&#13;
private health insurance schemes were frustrated by the withdrawal of low-&#13;
risk persons and selective enrollment by persons in poor health.&#13;
The alternative to voluntary health insurance is the compulsory --&#13;
usually public -- social insurance scheme. Under compulsory insurance, the&#13;
problem of selective   mlmetisTe Finated, and costs are shared by all&#13;
participants, regardless of their initial health status and their likelihood&#13;
of collecting benefits. Thus, the financial viability of the scheme is&#13;
assured, and premiums are set at levels that make it possible for those who&#13;
suffer high risks of illness to participate. Clearly, those who achieve low&#13;
risks through good hygiene, life style, preventive care, or good nutrition&#13;
share in the cost of the prodigal habits of their fellow group members.&#13;
The coverage of compulsory social insurance schemes is tradi-&#13;
tionally limited to those who are employed in the formal wage sector,&#13;
often in firms with a significant number of employees, in order to simplify&#13;
administration of premiums and benefits. Thus, those who are poorest or&#13;
least adequately served are most likely to be excluded-from coverage.  The&#13;
major virtue of a social insurance scheme is that it provides a regular and&#13;
assured source of funding for health activities, which in turn encourages&#13;
private suppliers to develop capacity to produce services. In middle-i-ncome&#13;
developing countries, enrollment under social insurance has expanded rapidly.&#13;
In Brazil, taxes have been imposed on agricultural commodities in order to&#13;
pay the social insurance premiums of farm workers, whose contributions to&#13;
the social insurance funds would otherwise be difficult to administer.&#13;
The second approach to financing health care has been direct&#13;
provision of services by public health facilities. This has been the case&#13;
most  requent y in  eveloping countries where an extensive health care&#13;
industry did not initially exist, and thus the immediate task was to expand&#13;
the production of services. Such an approach permits extensive government&#13;
control over the range and quality of care offered, and, perhaps more impor-&#13;
tant, allows public officials to direct resources to specific geographic&#13;
areas or population groups. It also places health workers on a government&#13;
salary, thereby eliminating the widespread problem of uncontrolled costs&#13;
that often accompanies private care on a fee-for-service basis. However,&#13;
the efficiency and effectiveness of the public health care svstem depend&#13;
critically on~ t-he qu t  of public administration.&#13;
With public provision of care, governments construct facilities,&#13;
train staff, purchase supplies, and compensate health workers directly.&#13;
This arrangement gives public officials control over the operations of the&#13;
health care system and removes the need to compensate providers for their&#13;
services.  But it also eliminates the discipline inherent in production of&#13;
services for private gain.  Consequently, financial disciplne ov&#13;
drugs, supplies, and sta f time is also lost. At the same time, private&#13;
financial incentives to compromise the quality of care are also reduced.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
Where governments have elected to produce, rather than only to&#13;
finance health care, a wide range of methods to generate funds have been&#13;
used. Most publicly produced health care is financed from general govern-&#13;
ment revnual.  In economically advanced countries, government revenues are&#13;
obtained primarily from taxes on personal and business income and on sales&#13;
of goods. The structure of taxation has often been carefully maintained to&#13;
encourage socially desirable activities (job creation, home ownership, etc.),&#13;
achieve fairly stable incomes, and improve the equity of income distribution.&#13;
Governments have also imposed a number of specific taxes earmarked for&#13;
social services. Levies on manufactured goods purchased by the relatively&#13;
' )affluent, such as al                                         , are often&#13;
employed, since they tend to redistribute income away from the rich and are&#13;
relatively easy to apply. Similar taxes are also imposed on luxury services,&#13;
such as hotel accommodations, restaurant meals, and admission to sports&#13;
events and movies. When a portion of these taxes is earmarked for health&#13;
care, the insecurities that accompany periodic budget decisions by politi-&#13;
cal authorities are reduced to some extent, thereby permitting longer-term&#13;
planning and encouraging career commitments to the health sector. Because&#13;
many disease control programs depend critically on continuity in their&#13;
application, such assurance of sustained financial support is important.           ,&#13;
Direct charges for services (user charges) are imposed by many&#13;
government-owned health schemes. These charges are typically only nominal,&#13;
and are intended to encourage more rational use of health resources rather&#13;
than to produce- signiicant revenues.  The most common charge 1S a small -&#13;
registration fee required of persons when they first come in with an ill-&#13;
ness. This charge is expected to discourage presentation of frivolous&#13;
complaints. Those who require additional care are generally not charged&#13;
for subsequent visits.&#13;
Direct charges for drugs provide another source of revenue.&#13;
Because patients in many countries demand drug treatment, it is important&#13;
both to discourage over-prescription and to generate revenues to cover the&#13;
cost of dru.  In a few countries (notably in West Africa), cooperative&#13;
local pharmacies have been established to purchase and distribute drugs.&#13;
This removes responsibility for drug logistics and control of inventories&#13;
from the ministry of health.. Such a system has generally improved supplies&#13;
and reduced problems of misappropriation.  Where drugs ari dist-ribltd frne&#13;
of charge by governments, control over diversion to private markets has&#13;
proved very difficult. In a few instances, local health workers have&#13;
developed extra-legal drug funds by demanding a small fee from all patients.&#13;
These sums have then been used to purchase drugs from private sources in&#13;
order to supplement the inadequate supplies provided by government.&#13;
NatinnPl-lotteries are employed by a handful of countries to&#13;
raise money to support health care activities and other social services.&#13;
The net proceeds of the lottery are usually earmarked for specific programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
Community Participation&#13;
Publicly operated health care programs in developing countries&#13;
now frequently require local participation in their financing. The most&#13;
common requirement is that the community organize itself to construct a&#13;
small clinic and/or a house for health workers. The community is expected&#13;
to contribute labor and local materials such as sand, gravel, and timber.&#13;
Government provides architectural drawings, construction supervision, and&#13;
materials not available locally. A few countries have developed standard&#13;
construction kits that include cement, steel reinforcing rods, doors,&#13;
windows, roofing material, and hardware. Local participation in construc-&#13;
tion both promotes the community's interest in the program and reduces the&#13;
initial capital cost to government.&#13;
Some programs require communities to provide labor from local&#13;
resources to operate the health facility, either in part or in whole. The&#13;
schemes have often been frustrated by problems of recruitment of local&#13;
health workers, equitable worker compensation by villagers, and/or failure&#13;
to sustain local participation. For example, in Papua New Guinea,&#13;
communities recently refused to construct staff housing for health workers.&#13;
External Assistance&#13;
Many governments rely heavily on external assistance. Voluntary&#13;
organizations (mostly missions) provide large sums to the poorest develop-&#13;
ing countries. These funds are typically spent under the joint administra-&#13;
tion of the ministry of health and the voluntary organizations. Often a&#13;
mission hospital or dispensary is designated to be the government-sponsored&#13;
health facility for an area, and is given subventions by the ministry of&#13;
health in return for providing care within the guidelines of official&#13;
government health policies. A number of bilateral assistance agencies also&#13;
provide grants to low-income developing countries to train staff, construct&#13;
facilities, and/or strengthen programs of health care. Historically, these&#13;
funds have been provided for time-limited programs rather than for support&#13;
of operating budgets. In 1979, an estimated US$880 million was provided&#13;
by external grants and loans. In addition, domestic and international&#13;
borrowing are occasionally used to finance capital expenditures. Most&#13;
governments have been reluctant to borrow to improve health programs,&#13;
preferring instead to use hard sources of finance for directly productive&#13;
investments. The resurgence of interest in health and social development&#13;
appears to be altering this order of priorities.&#13;
Selecting a Financing Mechanism&#13;
The means chosen to finance health care influence the efficiency&#13;
with which care is produced and consumed, and the equity with which it is&#13;
made available. A central political issue in health care finance is how to&#13;
remove unreasonable economic barriers. As noted above, the distribution of&#13;
health services is poorly regulated by prices and incomes.  A financing&#13;
mechanism should at minimum not introduce further inefficiencies, and if&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
possible ought to encourage better use of resources. Moreover, because the&#13;
cost of disease -- health care, custodial care and income loss -- may be&#13;
large relative to incomes, some method of financing health care at the&#13;
individual level is necessary. Private lenders often are not available,&#13;
and where available are prohibitively expensive; thus, a collective method&#13;
for financing health care is needed.&#13;
Private production of health services with reimbursement for&#13;
charge§ though insurnce has t            e of ensurin  concern amon   ro        s&#13;
fo ~ntiernal economic efficiency of programs, because the provider receives&#13;
the difference hetween revenues  rom insurance and his cost  of rendering&#13;
care.  However, he is also rewarded f_or lowering the quality of care and&#13;
for promoting the use of highly remunerated services. In Europe and North&#13;
America, reimbursement of private providers for services has resulted in&#13;
skyrocketing costs. The consumer is relieved of concern for the cost of&#13;
care, and, at the same time, providers are assured of payment of their fees&#13;
and charges. Countries that have national health insurance programs have&#13;
attempted to impose regulations to control costs of care by setting up&#13;
official fee schedules. Providers, however, have evaded these controls by&#13;
modifying the classifications under which they bill the insurance program,&#13;
charging for several rather than a single procedure. Follow-up treatment&#13;
has also been recommended by providers to increase revenues.&#13;
Two approaches have been developed to attack this problem. First,&#13;
attempts have been made to reimburse providers for the complete management&#13;
of a specific condition. For example, prenatal care, delivery, post-partum&#13;
care, and treatment of complications of childbirth may be reimbursed at a&#13;
set fee. This approach reduces the opportunities for over-billing for&#13;
services, and shifts responsibility for management of the problem to the&#13;
most qualified decision-maker -- the provider of health care. The second&#13;
approach is to compensate the provider for providing the patient with&#13;
comprehensive care for a period of time. Under this approach, the provider&#13;
receives a fixed sum -- perhaps determined by the age, sex, and other&#13;
objective attributes of the patient -- and in return must provide all health&#13;
care required by the person. This so-called "health maintenance" approach&#13;
shifts still greater responsibility onto the provider to select services&#13;
that will achieve health objectives at minimum cost.&#13;
A further option for improving the efficiency of insurance schemes&#13;
is to shift part of the financial burden of care to the consumer. This&#13;
burden should be reasonable and generally affordable, but should be large&#13;
enough to discourage excessive use of health care and to increase concern&#13;
for the efficiency with which care is rendered. The patient's contribution&#13;
to the cost of care may be either a fixed charge for care of a particular&#13;
illness or a percentage of charges, perhaps up to a specified maximum. The&#13;
purpose of the fixed initial charge is to discourage overuse of health care.&#13;
This charge is usually described as the "deductible" (e.g., the amount&#13;
deducted from a bill before reimbursement by the insurer) in affluent&#13;
countries, and is set at about half a day's pay for a skilled worker.  In&#13;
developing countries, this charge is described as the "registration" fee and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
is a much smaller percentage of incomes. Additional services are not&#13;
billed to the consumers. In some areas of the world, notably West Africa,&#13;
payments appear to increase the beneficiaries' esteem for a service.            7  y&#13;
Direct operation of health facilities by government eliminates&#13;
the perverse economic incentives of private production of health care but,&#13;
at the same time, introduces new problems. In all countries, access to&#13;
health care is, to some extent, inequitable, but in low-income countries,&#13;
the scarcity of resources and the absence of modern amenities in rural areas&#13;
produces very sharp differences in access between urban and rural areas.&#13;
A more serious defect of publicly provided health programs is&#13;
that they do not possess any internal, automatic mechanisms for financial,&#13;
economic, and technical control. With private provision of care, the&#13;
profit motive ensures some concern for costs and, with a properly designed&#13;
insurance scheme, costs are articulated to consumers, thus producing some&#13;
measure of accountability for these costs, and for the level, range and&#13;
quality of services. Health care workers who are salaried government&#13;
employees do not have the same incentives to achieve efficiency. However,&#13;
where local interest groups are well-organized and politically significant,&#13;
accountability may approach the levels of private systems. More frequently,&#13;
local accountability is weak, with consequent inefficiency.&#13;
The manner in which resources (especially drugs) are allocated to&#13;
communities is especially important. Where local health workers are allowed&#13;
to draw against central stores, there is a tendency to overuse drugs,&#13;
recognizing that, if one doesn't overprescribe, others will, so that,&#13;
regardless, supplies will be depleted prematurely. In many instances,&#13;
health workers have supplemented their meager incomes by requisitioning&#13;
drugs that they sell to patients, to retailers, or in some instances export&#13;
to neighboring countries. Because of the very rudimentary inventory&#13;
controls and lack of local accountability, these practices are difficult&#13;
to document.&#13;

            developing countries
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            After two decades of neglect, health has
            reappeared as a significant concern among development
            authorities and financing institutions. Recent studies have
            shown that modern medical technology has been a major factor
            influencing health in the developing countries. These
            studies also suggest that improvements in housing,
            sanitation, and hygiene have contributed more modestly to
            improvements in health in developing countries than they did
            in the economies now advanced. The immediate sector priority
            therefore is to broaden access to the most cost-effective
            elements of modern health care. The most promising solution
            to the problem of geographic access is primary health care,
            defined as essential health care provided in the community
            by relying upon community resources. Although the idea has
            strong political support, strategies for its large-scale
            implementation have not yet been devised. This paper
            explores the organizational and institutional problems that
            must be overcome and examines mechanisms for financing
            primary health care.
