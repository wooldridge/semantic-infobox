1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   The Organisation pour la Mise en Valeur du Fleuve Senegal (OMVS ) was created in 1972 by&#13;
Mali, Mauritania, and Senegal to promote the economic development of the Senegal River Basin for&#13;
purposes of irrigation, power supply and navigation. A member of the initially called Organisation des&#13;
Etats Riverains du Senegal (OERS), Guinea has now a status of observer in OMVS. The Senegal River,&#13;
1,800 km long, is one of the largest rivers in Africa. It begins in Guinea, flows north across the western&#13;
part of Mali, then turns north east, marking the border between Senegal and Mauritania until it reaches&#13;
the Atlantic Ocean at St. Louis (Map 28332). The total surface of the Senegal River Basin is about&#13;
290,000 km and supports a population of about two million people, or about 10% of the population of&#13;
the three countries. It consists of three main regions: the upper basin, the valley and the delta. It is the&#13;
heavy rainfall in the upper basin that provides almost the whole of the flow of the Senegal River which&#13;
brings water and life downstream to a vast stretch of land in desert and dry regions of Mauritania and&#13;
Senegal. These rains fall from April to October, causing an annual flood in the river for about two&#13;
months every year. Agriculture in the valley has traditionally depended on the annual flood. The flood&#13;
also allows the raising of livestock, the recharging of shallow acquifers that are tapped for village water&#13;
supply, the regeneration of vegetation cover and the reproduction of fish. In the past few decades,&#13;
however, all these activities were severely hampered due to drought, and malnutrition forced people to&#13;
migrate out of the valley.&#13;
1.2   It is partly in response to the severe drought and famine of the early 1970s that creation of&#13;
OMVS was accelerated. The original plans for OMVS called for the development of controlled&#13;
irrigation to permit double cropping of about 375.000 ha. The integrated development plan also&#13;
envisaged (a) barge traffic from Saint-Louis to Kayes; and (b) power supply to centers that could be&#13;
economically and technically served from hydropower sites. In 1981, with financing of about US$620&#13;
million from 12 donors, construction began on two dams - one at Diama, on the river delta, to prevent&#13;
intrusion of salt water into the lower valley and a second at Manantali in western Mali, for water storage,&#13;
river flow regulation and power generation. Both dams have been in operation since 1988. The barrier&#13;
dam at Diama has made irrigated agriculture possible throughout the year and allowed the supply of&#13;
water for populations and cattle upstream from Diama and for the city of Dakar. Storage of the annual&#13;
flood by the Manantali dam has allowed OMVS to maintain the Diama reservoir at full and stable level,&#13;
and to raise levels of two lakes (Guiers and Rkiz) considerably reducing costs for pumped irrigation&#13;
systems around these water bodies. Because of these improvements, irrigated agriculture has become a&#13;
major economic force in the valley. As of 1996, about 100,000 ha of controlled irrigation have been&#13;
developed. In addition, OMVS has tried to maintain an artificial flood for the population dependent on&#13;
flood recession agriculture with a target area of 50,000 ha, that can be cultivated in all but the driest&#13;
years.&#13;
1.3    While the navigation components of the integrated development plan for the valley show little&#13;
prospect of being justified in the medium-term and may have to be deferred, there is significant demand&#13;
for power in the capital cities of Bamako, Nouakchott, and Dakar and in the Senegal Valley itself, to&#13;
justify the development of power generation facilities at Manantali. The power facilities would help&#13;
minimizing the long-term cost of electricity supply to the three countries and improve the financial&#13;
situation of local utilities. Without the power component, no significant revenues would be generated&#13;
from the dams, revenues that could be used to reduce outstanding debt incurred in constructing the two&#13;
dams. Development of the power facilities fits well with the country assistance strategies of the three&#13;
countries which seek to lower domestic factor costs, including energy costs, the development of&#13;
agriculture and infrastructure and the promotion of private sectors. The power project will also help&#13;
mitigate the environmental and health problems that were caused by the building of the two dams.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
2. THE ENERGY SECTORS&#13;
2&#13;
2.1    Together, Mali, Mauritania and Senegal have a large surface area of about 2.5 million km , but&#13;
the countries have limited natural resources. As a result, the combined population of 20 million are&#13;
among the world's poorest. The economies are largely dependent on agriculture and fisheries which are&#13;
the primary source of income for most their population and account for the largest share of product&#13;
exports. Energy consumption in Mali, Mauritania and Senegal is dominated by fuelwood which&#13;
accounts for between 60% and 90% of the energy used. All three countries rely almost entirely on&#13;
imports to meet all their petroleum needs, with the exception of limited gas and oil production in&#13;
Senegal. Power generation is mainly thermal-based, with the exception of small hydroelectric plants in&#13;
Mali. The Manantali dam, also located in Mali, on the Senegal River is the first major attempt to use the&#13;
region's domestic resources to meet the demand for commercial energy in the three countries.&#13;
2.2   Some of the major issues in the energy sector in Mali are the high cost of energy (petroleum and&#13;
power), the limited access to power supply (especially in Mali and Mauritania), the unreliability and poor&#13;
quality of power supply (load shedding in Mali and Senegal), excessive Government involvement in the&#13;
power sector, the sector's adverse impact on public finances due to poor financial performance of&#13;
Government-owned utilities and large investment needs and the lack of private investment in the power&#13;
sector. In the household energy sector, the uncontrolled "mining" of wood has led to deforestation&#13;
around major cities and to an increase in CO2 emissions.&#13;
Mali&#13;
2&#13;
2.3    Background: Of the three countries, Mali is the largest, with an area of 1.24 million km . The&#13;
population was estimated at 10 million in 1995, with 80% living in rural areas. Its per capita income was&#13;
estimated at US$250 in 1995. Of the eight main cities in Mali, only Bamako, the capital, with a&#13;
population of about 800,000 inhabitants, is a major urban center. During the last six years, the&#13;
Government of Mali has undertaken major economic reforms, with the underlying objective of&#13;
improving the competitiveness of the economy and laying the foundation for sustained long-term growth&#13;
needed to help raise the standard of living and alleviate poverty. These reforms have removed&#13;
bottlenecks to private sector participation, allowing market forces to play a more important role in the&#13;
determination of economic outcomes. The impact of these reforms, including the change in parity of the&#13;
CFA Franc in January, 1994, is shown by the improvement in economic performance over the&#13;
adjustment period. Real GDP grew at a rate of 6% in 1995 compared to 2.4% in 1994. Inflation was&#13;
contained at about 12.5% compared to 24.8% in 1994. Budgetary revenues increased by 27.5% and&#13;
export revenues by 27%.&#13;
2.4    Energy Resources and Consumption: Mali's domestic energy resources consist of biomass&#13;
(fuelwood, charcoal, agricultural and agro-industrial residues), hydropower, and solar energy. Presently,&#13;
only biomass for household energy and hydropower are exploited on a significant scale. The country's&#13;
hydropower potential, based on the Senegal and Niger river systems, is estimated at about 1,000 MW&#13;
capable of producing 5,000 GWh in an average year. Of this potential, only about 50 MW (220 GWh)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
have been developed so far, at the Selingue and Sotuba plants on the Niger River and the Felou plant on&#13;
the Senegal river. Mali has no significant known fossil fuels and petroleum product consumption is&#13;
entirely dependent on imports (about 200,000 tons annually). Final energy consumption is low and was&#13;
estimated in 1992 at 1.83 million tons of oil equivalent (toe) which corresponds to a consumption of 200&#13;
kg of oil equivalent per capita per year. Fuelwood and charcoal represent more than 88% of the&#13;
consumption.&#13;
2.5    Energy Issues and Government Strategy: Major issues in the sector include the high cost of&#13;
power and petroleum, the limited access to and poor quality of power supply and accelerated&#13;
deforestation in areas supplying woodfuels to urban centers. To address these issues, the Government of&#13;
Mali has contracted the management of the power/water utility (EDM) to a private operator for a period&#13;
of four years, is making efforts to reduce the fragmented responsibility for investment planning and&#13;
system operation, and is investing in repairs of its hydropower facilities and expansion of thermal power&#13;
plants. Further private involvement is being contemplated, possibly under a concession contract or&#13;
through privatization of EDM, and/or independent power producers schemes (IPPs) to increase&#13;
productivity of the utility. In the petroleum sector, the Government has: (a) negotiated with the&#13;
refineries in Senegal (SAR) and C6te d'Ivoire (SIR) a lower price for their petroleum products, which&#13;
has saved the economy over US$10 million a year; (b) fully liberalized the procurement and distribution&#13;
of petroleum products; and (c) adopted a simplified system of tax collection at customs, incorporating&#13;
into a single tax all of the previous many taxation components. These measures have resulted in&#13;
increased competition and lower prices for petroleum products. Actions are being taken by the&#13;
Government to tackle the problem in the household energy sector, both on the supply and demand sides,&#13;
including the transfer of responsibility for the control and management of the natural forests from the&#13;
State to the local rural communities, the revision of the woodfuel tax system, and the promotion of inter-&#13;
fuel substitution and improved cooking stoves.&#13;
Mauritania&#13;
2.6    Background: Mauritania is also a vast country with 1.1 million kM2, but with a population of&#13;
only about 2 million people. The rate of urbanization is high, however, with over 60% living in towns.&#13;
The capital city of Nouakchott, established only three decades ago, now has about 730,000 inhabitants,&#13;
or nearly a third of the country's population. This is partly because of the impact of desertification,&#13;
which has been complicated by Mauritania's economic management performance which has seen a&#13;
checkered history. A foreign-led boom of investment and growth in the 1960s was followed by&#13;
stagnation and economic crisis in the 70s. Concerted efforts to focus on economic reform essentially&#13;
date from 1985, when the economic adjustment program now underway was launched. Efforts were&#13;
interrupted in 1989 by social turbulence. Since 1992, however, Mauritania's implementation of&#13;
structural policies have generally been satisfactory and hopes for a better future for this poorly endowed&#13;
country rest on mining and fisheries, which if well managed, offer good development potential. Major&#13;
infrastructure investments in the Senegal Valley have been made or are envisaged, including power,&#13;
which now offers a much richer potential for agricultural development. Mauritania has also made&#13;
important strides in human resource development, while the existence of a dynamic private sector offers&#13;
the potential of significant economic growth.&#13;
2.7    Energy Resources and Consumption: Mauritania's known energy resource base is small and&#13;
essentially consists of a fragile forest cover and potentially wind and solar energy. Energy consumption&#13;
is relatively low and is estimated at 0.55 million tons of oil equivalent (toe) in 1995. It is entirely&#13;
dependent on the importation of petroleum products to meet its commercial energy needs. Petroleum&#13;
products are supplied by a Government-owned refinery with a capacity of one million tons per year,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
located in the north of the country at Nouadhibou. The refinery imports crude oil from Algeria as well as&#13;
refined products at international prices. The annual consumption of petroleum products total some&#13;
315,000 tons/year. Household energy needs are met from domestic woodfuel resources, which are&#13;
rapidly dwindling. It is estimated that the production potential of forest resources in Mauritania is&#13;
100,000 tons a year, while consumption is estimated at 500,000 tons or five times the estimated rate of&#13;
regeneration. Electric power is supplied by isolated systems based on diesel generators. Less than half&#13;
of the generation capacity is publicly owned and managed by the local utility, SONELEC, and the rest by&#13;
the refinery and mining industry (SNIM mainly).&#13;
2.8    Energy Issues and Government Strategy: The energy sector in Mauritania suffers a number of&#13;
problems: (a) petroleum imports continue to be a burden on the balance of payments; (b) the&#13;
infrastructure facilities at both Nouakchott and Nouadhibou are inadequate to handle unloading and&#13;
storage of petroleum products, increasing costs and, in the case of Nouakchott could lead to a sudden&#13;
rupture in supplies; (c) until recently the reliability and efficiency of power supply was low; (d) the cost&#13;
of power generation remains relatively high, particularly for the population in the interior of the country&#13;
and the Senegal River valley; and (e) the adverse climatic conditions and the growth in the demand for&#13;
household fuels have put an enormous pressure on the natural vegetation cover and has led to severe&#13;
depletion in the country's meager forest resources.&#13;
2.9    Beginning in 1987, the Government of Mauritania pursued a well designed strategy that sought&#13;
to (a) attract private oil companies to explore for petroleum in the country; (b) liberalize the procurement&#13;
and distribution of petroleum products; (c) promote the conservation of woodfuel resources by&#13;
promoting improved wood and charcoal stoves and interfuel substitution; and (d) allow SONELEC more&#13;
autonomy to manage and operate the power sector. As a result, several oil companies signed contracts to&#13;
explore for petroleum off-shore where the prospects were the brightest. Secondly, there was a large&#13;
increase in the consumption of LPG by households and some experimentation with solar and wind&#13;
energy, which reduced the pressures on the local remaining woodfuel resources. Thirdly, SONELEC&#13;
was able to reliably supply power to an increasing number of consumers without being a burden on the&#13;
public budget.&#13;
Senegal&#13;
2&#13;
2.10   Background: Senegal is the smallest of the three countries with an area of 197,000 km .&#13;
Senegal's GNP of US$608 per capita in 1995 places it among the lower-middle income economies, with&#13;
a population of 9.2 million growing at a high but declining rate of about 2.7% a year. This is greater than&#13;
the rate of growth of GDP which was 1.9% from 1985 through 1995. The level of urbanization is 42%&#13;
and growing, placing it well above the sub-Saharan Africa average of 28%. The country's social&#13;
indicators are low and stagnant. The adult literacy rate is about 33%; primary school enrollment is at&#13;
56%. Modern sector activities are concentrated around the capital city of Dakar which has a population&#13;
of about 2.5 million and along the coast. Foreign exchange reserves are earned principally from&#13;
groundnut, phosphate, chemical and fish exports and from tourism. Agriculture accounts for about 20%&#13;
of GDP but employs 60% of the population. Groundnuts are the most important crop, accounting for&#13;
75% of farm cash income. Since the beginning of the 1990s, the economy experienced a serious decline,&#13;
with a contraction of output in key sectors, including food and fish processing, phosphates and textiles.&#13;
In an attempt to reverse this economic deterioration the Government adopted a series of adjustment&#13;
measures in 1993, including cuts in public sector wages. After the devaluation of the currency in 1994,&#13;
the Government started to implement a medium-term strategy for the development of the private sector.&#13;
As a result, GDP is estimated to have grown by 4.8% in 1995, with substantial growth in exports of fish,&#13;
groundnut products, phosphates and tourism. Senegal's privileged geographic location and good&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
communication infrastructure give it the potential to become a gateway service center in the region and&#13;
to benefit from its proximity to European markets.&#13;
2.11   Energy Resources and Consumption: Senegal has diversified energy resources, but under&#13;
present conditions their use is associated with either environmental risks (forest-based fuels) or&#13;
substantial investment outlays for research (hydrocarbons) and mobilization (hydroelectricity, solar and&#13;
wind power). Energy consumption is dominated by woodfuels, which account for 53% of energy used.&#13;
Available forest stock information indicates that Senegal could reasonably expect to meet much of its&#13;
demand for household fuels, provided the forest stock is properly managed. In reality, however, supply&#13;
of wood to the urban and peri-urban areas is based on geographically concentrated and non-sustainable&#13;
forest management practices that have led to a gradual loss of forest cover and degradation of the rural&#13;
environment. The country's hydroelectric potential, based on the Senegal and Gambia rivers is estimated&#13;
at 1,000 MW which has still to be tapped. Fossil fuels in the form of heavy petroleum was discovered in&#13;
the 1950s offshore at Dome Flore (100 million tons), but it has yet to be produced. Small amounts of&#13;
natural gas and light petroleum, however, were discovered and produced onshore near Dakar (Diam&#13;
Nadio). Between 1987 and 1992, these fields produced 61,000 barrels of crude oil and 31 million cubic&#13;
meters of natural gas which was used to produce electricity. Additional gas reserves were discovered&#13;
recently in the same area (amount estimated at 10 billion m3). Most of Senegal's commercial energy&#13;
needs are met, however, by imported petroleum products which totaled 900,000 tons in 1994 and&#13;
claimed 16% of export earnings.&#13;
2.12   Energy Issues and Government Strategy:  Senegal's energy sector is dominated by public&#13;
sector agencies, the performance of which has been hampered inter alia by a lack of real management&#13;
autonomy, lack of transparency and competition, and lack of incentives to run efficiently the sector. The&#13;
cost of petroleum products are high to the economy because the local refinery (Societe Africaine de&#13;
Raffinage - SAR) has the monopoly to procure all products and refines crude at an uneconomic cost, and&#13;
has been granted a supplement of US$ 2.30/barrel that has not led to improvements in operational&#13;
efficiency. Similarly, the local utility, SENELEC, has the monopoly for the production and distribution&#13;
of electricity, but has been mismanaged, resulting in poor service, deteriorating generating facilities and&#13;
low level of connections, despite improvements resulting from the action plan implemented as of 1993&#13;
(see para. 3.44). In the context of its structural adjustment program, the Government has been taking&#13;
some important measures in most sectors, except energy. Beginning this year, however, it is determined&#13;
to implement reforms in the energy sector that are expected to increase the availability of energy, reduce&#13;
costs and minimize environmental problems. The Government has articulated its policy to deal with&#13;
household fuels without the loss of forest cover by devolving responsibilities for forest management to&#13;
local rural communities. In its Letter of Sector Development Policy (February 1997), the Government&#13;
has also stated its intention of abolishing the monopoly of SAR, liberalizing petroleum procurement and&#13;
pricing and privatizing the power sector. These measures should lead to lower prices for petroleum&#13;
products as well as power and better and more efficient service.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
3. POWER SECTORS&#13;
3.1    The three national utilities will be supplied with the energy to be produced at Manantali. The&#13;
largest is SENELEC (Senegal) with a peak load of 276 MW in 1995 ; Energie du Mali (Mali) has a peak&#13;
load of 50 MW and SONELEC (Mauritania) is the smallest with a peak load of 31 MW. The financial&#13;
situation of the power utilities is chronically weak despite relative high electricity tariffs, but is expected&#13;
to improve with the power supplied by Manantali.&#13;
MALI (EDM)&#13;
A.    Power Sector Organization&#13;
3.2    Established in 1960, Energie du Mali (EDM) is a mixed capital company with the Government&#13;
holding the majority (97.2%) of the shares and Electricite de France (EdF), the remainder (2.8%). EDM&#13;
is administrated by a Board with nine members, of which seven are appointed by the Government, one&#13;
by EdF and one by the staff of EDM. EDM has about 1,300 employees of which 88 are classified as&#13;
professional staff. Although the total number of staff is high for a utility company of this size, there is&#13;
still a shortage of suitable qualified staff. EDM has its own training center, the Centre de&#13;
Perfectionnement du Personnel (CPP), and also sends some staff for training at the Ecole Superieure&#13;
Interafricaine d'Electricite (ESIE) and the Centre des Metiers de l 'Electricite (CME) in C6te d'Ivoire.&#13;
3.3    Sector regulation, policy and coordination are ensured by the Ministry of Mines, Energy and&#13;
Hydraulics (MMEH). The Ministry of Finance and Commerce (MFC) also participates in tariff&#13;
approval.&#13;
B.    Existing Power Facilities&#13;
3.4    The existing supply system in Mali comprises of an interconnected power system with a capacity&#13;
of about 92 MW and 10 isolated centers totaling 13 MW. Detailed characteristics of existing facilities are&#13;
provided in Annex 1. The Selingue hydroelectric plant is Mali's largest plant and the principal source of&#13;
electric energy. It has an installed capacity of 44 MW and an average potential output of about 180 GWh.&#13;
EDM also operates two other plants in Bamako, the Sotuba hydroelectric plant with an installed capacity&#13;
of 5.4 MW and an average annual output of 39 GWh, and the Dar Salam diesel plant with an installed&#13;
capacity of 20 MW. The Balingue diesel plant has been completed in 1997 with an installed capacity of&#13;
23 MW (in units of 1 to 2.25 MW). The isolated centers are supplied by diesel units varying in capacity&#13;
from 35 kVA to 1375 kVA, except for the 500 kW Felou hydroelectric plant which meets part of the&#13;
demand of the town of Kayes. Mali's principal transmission grid interconnected system comprises 350&#13;
km of 150 kV lines (130 km from Selingu6 to Bamako, 220 km from Bamako to Segou), 127 km of 66&#13;
kV lines (Selingud to Kalano) and 75 km of 30 kV lines forming a loop around Bamako and supplying&#13;
the town of Koulikoro. The 150 kV and 66 kV systems are reasonably well maintained. The distribution&#13;
system (15 kV and low voltage lines and substations) in Bamako as well as in the isolated centers is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
being rehabilitated and expanded, so that reliability of service will be improved, high energy losses&#13;
(21%) reduced and access to power expanded.&#13;
C.    Access to Power Service and Consumption&#13;
3.5   In 1995, EDM had about 66,200 customers of which about 80% were served by the Bamako&#13;
system. About 50,000 customers were classified as domestic and about 7% of the Malian population had&#13;
access to electricity. Even in Bamako, with about 51,000 customers, the rate of electrification is only&#13;
about 40%. From 1987 to 1995 EDM's electricity sales grew from 135 GWh to 216 GWh, an average&#13;
annual increase of 6% compared to the rate of about 13% from 1981 to 1987, mainly due to supply&#13;
limitations (generation capacity and distribution network expansion). Demand studies demonstrate that&#13;
there is a considerable potential for increased electricity use. To address this supply constraint and&#13;
improve efficiency of the system, EDM has designed a least-cost development program for the Mali&#13;
power system, that includes the following: (a) completion of the Selingue Rehabilitation project (Cr.&#13;
2850-ML) and rehabilitation and extension of distribution network in Bamako and isolated centers, now&#13;
being undertaken and financed by the Power II project (Cr.1998-ML); (b) completion of the&#13;
rehabilitation program and extension of generation systems in isolated systems also underway and&#13;
funded by CFD and KfW; (c) reinforcement of the thermal capacity by construction of the Balingue&#13;
plant; and (d) in the medium/long-term (2000/2001), development of the Manantali power development&#13;
facilities and expansion of the transmission system (Manantali-Bamako; Segou-Sikasso-Koutiala-&#13;
Bougouni) and possibly the interconnection with the Cote d'Ivoire transmission system.&#13;
D.    EDM's Financial Performance&#13;
3.6   In the absence of a Malian Chart of Accounts, EDM's accounting system is based on accrual&#13;
accounting principles using the 1982 French Chart of Accounts. These principles have not been properly&#13;
followed because of EDM's technical and management weaknesses which are being addressed through a&#13;
four-year management contract that started in 1995 (para 3.9). Since 1983, EDM's accounts have been&#13;
audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. Because of the weaknesses indicated above, the&#13;
result has always been a disclaimer of opinion. One of the immediate objectives of the ongoing&#13;
management contract (see para. 3.9) is to address this problem and have the fiscal year (FY) 1996&#13;
accounts certified without significant qualification.&#13;
3.7   The key financial indicators of EDM's activity in recent years are shown in the following table:&#13;

3.8    EDM charges uniform electricity tariffs throughout the country. The average tariff level in 1995&#13;
was CFAF 72/kWh (US$ 0.14/kWh). Financial indicators show that EDM's financial performance&#13;
improved steadily until 1993. In 1994, however, in spite of a 19% electricity tariff increase which&#13;
resulted in increased revenues and operating income, EDM sustained important losses (CFAF 3.3&#13;
billion). Two combined factors explain this result: the 1994 devaluation of the CFA Franc and the&#13;
constitution by EDM of important provisions for doubtful receivables which were previously&#13;
underestimated. The January 1994 devaluation resulted in a 45% increase of fuel costs and the doubling&#13;
of the debt service (for which EDM bears the foreign exchange risk). The amount of provisions made in&#13;
1994 for doubtful receivables was CFAF 3.8 billion compared to CFAF 0.4 billion in 1993. Although&#13;
EDM's current ratio appears reasonable, its net working capital is tied up in customer receivables (CFAF&#13;
17.5 billion at the end of 1995 representing about 8 months of billing). This has been one of the main&#13;
reasons for EDM's persistent liquidity problem.&#13;
E.    Sector Reforms&#13;
3.9    Until recently, the power sector in Mali was poorly organized, with responsibilities divided&#13;
among several public sector agencies. Under reforms supported by IDA and other donors, planning and&#13;
operation of all power facilities (with the exception of regional and multi-purpose projects), as well as&#13;
the responsibility for the supply and distribution of electricity was consolidated in EDM. Despite the&#13;
persistent efforts at training and technical assistance programs funded by donors, EDM management&#13;
capacity and performance has shown little improvement in the last ten years. As a result, the Government&#13;
decided on a more drastic line of action and contracted out all of EDM's management to a private&#13;
professional partner in 1995 for a period of four years. In the medium-term, the role of the State in the&#13;
power sector will be revisited and the institutional framework and regulation system revised to promote a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
rapid and sustainable development of the sector and allow private participation and investment. Studies&#13;
will be carried out under the recently IDA-approved Selingue Power Rehabilitation Project (Cr.2850-&#13;
ML) that would serve as a basis for further reforms. The updated content and timetable of activities for&#13;
continuing the reform of Mali's power sector was agreed during credit negotiations (para. 8.1) and is&#13;
summarized in Annex 3.&#13;
3.10   To address the deteriorating financial situation, a restructuring plan was adopted in October 1995&#13;
which includes the following: (a) some of EDM's debt to the GOM was written off (US$30.0 million);&#13;
(b) EDM's investments for the 1995-1999 period were exonerated of taxes and duties; and (c) electricity&#13;
tariff levels are to be increased by 9% by January 1998. This plan also takes into account substantial&#13;
improvement in EDM's management performance under the current management contract. These&#13;
improvements include in particular a decrease in EDM's receivables from 246 days in 1994 to 70 days in&#13;
1998 and a reduction in network losses from 21% to 16% in 1998. In the water sector, in the context of&#13;
the Urban Development and Decentralization Project (IF-004) which covers most investments needed&#13;
over the next four years for the Bamako area, an agreement was reached with the Government to increase&#13;
prices, over the 1998-2002 period, in order to meet marginal development costs. Water prices would&#13;
thus increase from 195 CFAF per m3 in 1997 to 404 CFAF per m3 in 2002. As a result, EDM's financial&#13;
future position appears reasonable beyond 1998. However, in the short term (1997-1998), because of the&#13;
higher than expected electricity demand which resulted in a more costly thermal/hydro generation mix,&#13;
the Government needs to take measures to balance EDM's operating statement, in parallel with expected&#13;
cost reductions and commercial performance improvements in EDM's operations resulting from the&#13;
management contract. These measures will form an action plan (which objectives are summarized in&#13;
Annex 3) for restoring the financial viability of EDM over the period 1997-1999. The finalization of an&#13;
action plan, satisfactory to IDA, to improve the financial situation of EDM, is a condition of credit&#13;
effectiveness (para. 8.2).&#13;

3.12   The average tariff level for electricity was CFAF 71.6 per kWh in 1995 (U.S$ 0.14/kWh). The&#13;
above table shows that tariffs should increase from their current level to 82.5 CFAF/kWh in 1998 and&#13;
86.5 CFAF/kWh in 1999. It should be noted, however, that the necessary tariff adjustment will be&#13;
established in the action plan mentioned in para. 3.10, in order to reflect most recent data on EDM actual&#13;
position and perspectives and to reach financial objectives as presented in Annex 3. Beyond the year&#13;
2000, tariffs would remain constant in current terms. As for water supply, tariffs will be increased&#13;
according to the decisions referred to in para. 3.10.&#13;
3.13   For the period 1998-2005, EDM would benefit from a steady increase of revenues due to both&#13;
the tariff revisions and the rise in demand. The total revenues  would  increase by  an  average 11 % per&#13;
year for electricity and 13% for water. The operating income for energy would show a deterioration from&#13;
1997 to 1999, due to intensive use of expensive thermal generators in Bamako to meet the demand.&#13;
After that, however, the purchase of energy from Manantali (average price CFAF97 23.4/kWh) will allow&#13;
a sharp decrease in fuel expenses and raise the operating income level to more than 25%  of revenues.&#13;
Net income would rise sharply until the year 2000 and would then amount to 10% of revenues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I1&#13;
3.14   The rate of return on rate-base would remain between 1% and 3% until 2000, but would reach&#13;
6% thereafter. Assuming financing of 80 to 85 % of new investments with new loans, the debt service&#13;
coverage ratio stays always above 1.7. The debt equity ratio should grow from 0.9 in 1995 to 1.3 in&#13;
2001, as a result of the sharp increase of long term debt (due to a large investment program).&#13;
3.15   Impact of Manantali. As expected, the projections prove that the impact of Manantali energy&#13;
on EDM financial performance is very positive. The main reason for it is that Manantali will represent&#13;
around 50% of the total consumption of energy in Mali between 2001 and 2005. A second reason lies in&#13;
the high difference in the operating costs of thermal unit in Bamako and the price of Manantali energy.&#13;
Compared with Senegal or Mauritania, thermal operating costs are higher in Mali because of the&#13;
transportation costs of combustible. In addition, losses in power transportation from Manantali to Mali&#13;
are lower than for the other two countries due to the shorter distance.&#13;
3.16  In the absence of Mananta]i supply, EDM would suffer from higher operating costs and the need&#13;
for an urgent and huge investment program. In order to allow EDM to reach a similar financial&#13;
performance, the tariff would have to rise between 2002 and 2005 to reflect the full inflation rate, and an&#13;
additional 12% exceptional adjustment would have to be adopted in 2001. As a result, the tariff would&#13;
be 23% higher without Manantali.&#13;
3.17   Underlying assumptions. The projections highlight the measures and improvements required&#13;
for EDM to reach the financial objectives on which the projections are based including the following:&#13;
(a) actual adjustment of tariffs according to the revised schedule;&#13;
(b) improvements in bill collection from private and public consumers;&#13;
(c) stabilization of staff numbers; and&#13;
(d) timely implementation of scheduled investments, in particular regarding distribution.&#13;

MAURITANIA (SONELEC)&#13;
A.    Power Sector Organization&#13;
3.18   Since its creation in 1975, SONELEC, a government-owned company, has the responsibility for&#13;
the production and distribution of water and electricity for the country as a whole. It is governed by an&#13;
eight member Board of Directors and has a staff of 710 persons, of which two-thirds deal with electricity&#13;
and one-third with water-supply. SONELEC provides electricity to seven urban centers, water service to&#13;
ten and sewerage services to three centers. In addition, a program has been completed to electrify 13&#13;
additional small centers, with populations of above 10,000. Today, SONELEC has greatly improved its&#13;
service coverage, efficiency and reliability. Clarification of the respective obligations and responsibilities&#13;
of SONELEC and Government was established through the preparation of the first contrat-programme in&#13;
1989 which has been renewed twice. Sector regulation, policy and coordination are ensured by the&#13;
Ministry of Hydraulics and Energy (MHE). The Ministry of Finance also participates in tariff approval.&#13;
B.    Existing Power Facilities&#13;
3.19   Because of the large distances involved, there is no interconnected electricity system. Moreover&#13;
all of its generation is thermal based. Total generating capacity in Mauritania is about 145 MW of which&#13;
about 65 MW is owned and operated by SONELEC, including a 28 MW plant (4X7 MW) in the capital&#13;
city of Nouakchott, a 20 MW plant in the northern port city of Nouadhibou and about 15 MW in small&#13;
diesel plants in secondary urban centers. In addition, the iron ore company, SNIM is responsible for a 56&#13;
MW plant at the mining town of Zouerate and a 17 MW plant at the Nouadhibou harbor. The refinery at&#13;
Nouadhibou operates its own 6.8 MW unit.&#13;
C.    Access to Power Service and Consumption&#13;
3.20  In 1995, SONELEC had 29,000 customers, of which about two-thirds were in Nouakchott, 17%&#13;
in Nouadhibou and 5% in Rosso in the South. More than 99% of customers are classified as domestic. In&#13;
Nouakchott, the rate of electrification is about 20% and in Nouadhibou 17%. From 1984 to 1995,&#13;
SONELEC's electricity sales more than doubled from 69 GWh in 1984 to 162 GWh in 1995, an average&#13;
annual increase of nearly 9% per year. Studies indicate that demand is expected to increase at about the&#13;
same rate (10%) for the next 3 years and then to taper off to 5.5% per year.&#13;
D.    SONELEC's Financial Performance&#13;
3.21   Approximately two-thirds of SONELEC's revenues are derived from the sale of electricity, and&#13;
the remaining one-third from the sale of water. The key financial indicators of SONELEC's activities&#13;
(electricity and water) are shown in the table below. From 1991 to 1995, energy sales grew by 35% in&#13;
both Nouakchott and Nouadhibou, while sales of water remained nearly unchanged, partly because of&#13;
water production problems. Except for 1992, SONELEC made a net profit every year. Its net internal&#13;
cash generation amounted to over UM 1.1 billion in 1995, its rate of return on rate-base was around 4%&#13;
and the self-financing ratio reached 97%. Tariffs, however, have been raised regularly, partly to&#13;
compensate for the devaluation of the Ouguiya (UM), which increased the costs of imported materials.&#13;
Average electricity tariffs in 1995 were 20.8 UM/kWh or US$ 0.17/kWh and average water tariffs were&#13;
120.4 UM/m3 or nearly US$ 1.0 per cubic meter, which is very high even by West African standards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
3.22    Under the first contrat-programme signed in 1989, SONELEC enjoyed a number of tax and duty&#13;
exemptions. Some of these taxes have now been re-imposed and SONELEC costs in 1996 will increase&#13;
even further because it would begin to pay normal import duties on fuel used, which is an important&#13;
element of SONELEC's operating costs.&#13;
3.23    In 1995, SONELEC's financial structure appeared reasonable. Debt-equity ratio was under the&#13;
1.0 level. Customer receivables represented only 4.1 months of billing, which is good performance for a&#13;
utility in the region. However, the rise in operating expenses in 1995 was only partly covered by a tariff&#13;
increase, which led to a deterioration of operating income. Moreover, the company still faces serious&#13;
difficulties in its fight against fraud, which causes high operating losses. The net income reached only 60&#13;
million UM  in 1995 compared to 210 million UM  in 1994.&#13;

E.      Sector Reforms&#13;
3.24    In the early eighties, the situation at SONELEC was chaotic and bleak. Statistics on production&#13;
and distribution were non-existent and financial records not maintained. In Nouakchott, only one diesel&#13;
group out of 15 was in working order, and the availability of electricity practically nil. Beginning in&#13;
1984, SONELEC benefited from a large amount of technical assistance, supported primarily by the&#13;
French and IDA, both at the management and technical levels. This assistance has been greatly reduced&#13;
in recent years and functions taken over by qualified Mauritanians. In addition, SONELEC and the&#13;
Governments obligations and responsibilities were spelled out in a contrat-programme that went into&#13;
effect in 1989 and which allowed SONELEC a fair amount of autonomy. A second contrat-programme&#13;
was signed in 1992 and a third contrat-programme went into effect recently for the period June 1995 to&#13;
June 1998. Contracts have been strictly adhered to by both parties and have been instrumental in&#13;
substantially improving SONELEC's performance, although the deterioration noted in 1995 (para 3.23)&#13;
required short-term actions by the Government and SONELEC. Service has become much more&#13;
efficient and reliable and as the financial results show, SONELEC is no longer a burden on the public&#13;
finances. Mauritania, however, has not developed an investment program for the power sector. It is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
becoming increasingly clear that the utility has run into capacity constraints, particularly at Nouakchott&#13;
and that the power needs of the Senegal Valley have to be addressed. The two obvious options to meet&#13;
the increase in demand are add to existing thermal capacity or interconnect with the Manantali dam.&#13;
Studies have confirmed that the Manantali option is economically preferable. During credit&#13;
negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government of Mauritania on a timebound action plan for&#13;
defining and implementing the reform of Mauritania's power sector (para 8.1). Annex 3 presents a draft&#13;
of this action plan.&#13;
F.    SONELEC's Future Finances&#13;
3.25   Based on the objectives in the latest contrat-programme, the financial forecasts for SONELEC&#13;
are shown in the table below. The contract calls for further improvements in SONELEC's performance.&#13;
For example, the billing rate for electricity is expected to increase from 87% in 1994 to 90% in 1998, the&#13;
collection rate from 82% to 85% for private customers and electricity connections from 57 per employee&#13;
to 80 in 1998.&#13;
3.26   The following table presents forecasts of SONELEC's future activity and financial performance&#13;
(detailed assumptions have been placed in Project Files).&#13;

3.27   In 1995, the average tariff for electricity was 20.8 UM/kWh (US$ 0.17/kWh) and average water&#13;
tariff was 120 UM/mI3 (nearly US$ 1.0 per m3). Given the financial constraints that SONELEC will face&#13;
in the future, both tariffs will need to be revised every year upwards from 1996 to 2005 at the rate of&#13;
internal inflation.&#13;
3.28   From 1996 to 2005, SONELEC's activities would show a steady rise in revenues due to both the&#13;
increases in tariffs and the strong rise in demand, especially for electricity. Total revenues would&#13;
increase on average by 12% per year for electricity and 13% for water. Electricity operating income&#13;
would grow steadily from 2% in 1995 and 1996 to 14% in 2000 and 17 % in 2005, mostly due to the&#13;
purchase of energy from Manantali, that will allow SONELEC to limit new investments. At the same&#13;
time, water operating income would remain at a high level of around 30% from 2000 to 2005 (from 16%&#13;
in 1995). The net income would be kept between 4% and 9% of revenues throughout this period.&#13;
3.29   The rate of return on rate-base would rise from 4% in 1997 to a comfortable 8% in 2000. The&#13;
debt-service coverage ratio stays always above 1.4, even though 80 to 85% of new investments is&#13;
financed with new loans (including US$100 million for a water-supply project which involves the&#13;
construction of the Af Tout Essahly canal). The debt equity ratio would grow from 1.2 in 1996 to 2.6 in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
2001, and will then decrease to 1.5 in 2005. The current ratio would stay between 1.6 and 2.7 over the&#13;
whole period.&#13;
3.30  Impact of Manantali . The impact of Manantali energy on SONELEC's financial performance&#13;
will be limited for several reasons:&#13;
(a) Although the total purchases of Manantali energy are significant compared to total production of&#13;
SONELEC (40% in 2002), the direct costs of this source of energy are close to direct generation&#13;
costs of the Nouakchott plant. Thus, the savings for SONELEC will only come in the longer&#13;
term, from savings related to deferral of capacity investment.&#13;
(b) To face demand growth in 1999 and 2001, SONELEC has planned a 7 MW extension in&#13;
Nouakchott. With the arrival of Manantali energy in 2001 and until about 2005, SONELEC will&#13;
have unused thermal facilities that will cost the utility (fixed maintenance, debt service).&#13;
(c) Manantali will only supply the Nouakchott area, as well as Rosso and Kaedi. In Nouadhibou and&#13;
other urban centers, SONELEC will continue to use thermnal generation.&#13;
3.31   Underlying assumptions. Projections highlight the requirements and measures for SONELEC to&#13;
reach the financial objectives, including the following:&#13;
(a) revision of tariffs in accordance with inflation;&#13;
(b) timely implementation of investment schedule, especially regarding the water sector;&#13;
(c) improvements in collection of billing;&#13;
(d) stabilization of the staff numbers;&#13;
(e) reduction of miscellaneous expenses.&#13;
&#13;

SENEGAL (SENELEC)&#13;
A.    Power Sector Organization&#13;
3.32   Until December 1971, electricity supply was in the hands of private companies operating under&#13;
concessions granted by the Government. In January 1972, the Government terminated the concessions of&#13;
the most important private company and transferred its functions to the public sector. It was, however,&#13;
only in 1983 that SENELEC in its present form was created to be responsible for the generation,&#13;
transmission and distribution of electricity in all of Senegal. Unlike its counterparts in Mali and&#13;
Mauritania, SENELEC is not involved in supplying water and sewerage services. SENELEC is governed&#13;
by a Board composed mainly of public sector officials, and management is delegated to a Director&#13;
General. SENELEC has a large number of employees (2,230), of which about 12% are classified as&#13;
professionals, all Senegalese nationals.&#13;
3.33   The number of connections per employee is about 137. The total number of staff has been&#13;
slightly reduced in the past five years, but it remains high for a company of this size. Nevertheless, many&#13;
professional posts are still unfilled. Training is the responsibility of a department attached to the&#13;
Directorate of Human Resources.&#13;
3.34   Sector regulation, policy and coordination are ensured by the Ministry of Energy, Mines and&#13;
Industry (MEMI). The Ministry of Economy, Finance and Planning (MEFP) also participates in tariff&#13;
approval.&#13;
B.    Existing Power Facilities&#13;
3.35   The existing supply system in Senegal comprises of an interconnected power system with a&#13;
capacity of about 280 MW, and some 24 isolated centers totaling 50 MW, including Saint- Louis (11&#13;
MW), Kahone (14 MW), Boutoute (10 MW), and Tambacounda (5 MW). The largest plant is located in&#13;
the outskirts of the capital of Dakar (Cap des Biches) with a capacity of 188 MW. All of the plants are&#13;
thermal-based, and the annual consumption of petroleum products amount to 300,000 tons. SENELEC&#13;
also purchases excess energy (4 GWh in 1994), from independent producers of electricity who have an&#13;
installed capacity of around 90 MW. Senegal's principal transmission grid comprises of 60 km of&#13;
220 kV, 295 km of 90 kV and 2,000 km of 30 kV lines. It has in addition 650 km of 6.6 kV and 2,500 km&#13;
of low voltage lines. A BOOT contract is in under negotiation, by which the utility would purchase&#13;
300 GWh per year on a take-or-pay basis, with an additional 50 GWh purchased if needed. The 50 MW&#13;
plant is expected to begin operations in two steps: a 35 MW gas turbine in January 1998 and a 15 MW&#13;
combined cycle unit in January 1999.&#13;
C.    Access to Power Service and Consumption&#13;
3.36  In 1995, SENELEC had more than 280,000 customers, of which 3 industrial consumers (TAIBA,&#13;
SOCOCIM, ICS) accounted for 20% of the energy sold. Of this total, 170,000 customers are in the Dakar&#13;
area and the remainder (110,000) in the interior. The rate of electrification is about 25% (50% in the&#13;
urban centers and 5% in the rural areas).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
D.      SENELEC's Financial Performance&#13;
3.37    In recent years, SENELEC's accounts have been audited by independent auditors. Because of&#13;
serious and recurrent weaknesses in book-keeping practices, as well as in management practices, the&#13;
result were always a disclaimer of opinion until fiscal year 1994. After a first refusal to certify 1994&#13;
accounts, SENELEC and the auditor worked together at the beginning of 1996 in order to address&#13;
problems identified and carry out all necessary corrections. A second report published in March 1996,&#13;
concluded on the certification of the company's 1994 corrected accounts with reserves that are, however,&#13;
of a very serious nature, mainly concerning the reconciliation of customer accounts..&#13;
3.38    The key financial indicators of SENELEC's activity for the period 1991 to 1995 are shown in the&#13;
table below. In spite of an increase in energy sales, SENELEC's financial performance has been&#13;
chronically weak in the past few years. Recurrent high losses due to a low productivity and high non-&#13;
technical costs led to a contraction of the company's equity. From 1991 to 1995, energy sales grew at an&#13;
average annual rate of 5.1% and reached 900 GWh by 1995. This improvement was due to a substantial&#13;
increase in domestic consumption over the whole period and a sharp rise in industrial demand after the&#13;
1994 devaluation. As there has been no expansion of generation facilities, the increase in demand was&#13;
met by a more intense use of existing generators and improvements in operating standards: the global&#13;
efficiency of power transmission and distribution recorded a 3% increase from 1991 to 1995.&#13;
3.39    Despite this improvement, the company sustained high losses of CFAF 7.0 billion in 1994 and&#13;
CFAF 7.2 billion in 1995 (after provisions for equipment renewal), or nearly 11% of revenues. The last&#13;
tariff increase was granted in 1994, and prior to that, in 1989. The tariff level had been stable since 1986,&#13;
because the Government did not pass on to SENELEC the decrease in the cost of fuel which it enjoyed&#13;
due to the lower prices of crude and the weakness of the US dollar. The 28% increase in the tariff&#13;
allowed in 1994 compensated the impact of the CFA devaluation on operating costs (+24%) and the&#13;
increase in some taxes. The present average tariff is 70.6 CFAF/kWh or US$ 0.14/kWh which is high,&#13;
even for a system of this size. Furthermore, the tariff structure is complex and has become inadequate.&#13;
Although since 1976, SENELEC has been implementing a tariff structure based on long-term marginal&#13;
costs basis, this includes a steep degressivity for higher levels of consumption, which is not relevant any&#13;
longer as SENELEC now faces frequent capacities shortages.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
3.40   The 1994 CFA Franc devaluation had a strong impact on SENELEC's operating costs. Firstly,&#13;
SENELEC registered a CFAF 7.2 billion foreign exchange loss, both on long-term debt and short-term&#13;
suppliers credit. The repayments and interests on those foreign debts doubled. Then, there was a sharp&#13;
rise in direct generation costs (mainly gasoil and heavy fuel) in 1994, which has further increased&#13;
because of a more frequent use of expensive gas turbines to meet a higher demand. Lastly, as no&#13;
reevaluation of fixed assets has been realized, the depreciation is still calculated on a historical value&#13;
basis. On the other hand, manpower costs remained under control, with a reasonable 10% rise in 1994,&#13;
due to a stabilization of the number of employees and a strict wage control after the devaluation.&#13;
3.41   From 1991 to 1994, the gross internal cash generated amounted to an average of CFAF 11.5&#13;
billion per year and reached CFAF 17.3 billion in 1995. However, mostly due to the devaluation of the&#13;
CFAF, the net internal cash generated became negative in 1994 and 1995, at about minus CFAF 2.0&#13;
billion. For the same reason, the debt service coverage ratio has deteriorated. In 1994 and 1995, the ratio&#13;
fell under the 1.0 level, so that SENELEC's revenues were too low to meet debt service. As a result,&#13;
SENELEC's capacity to invest decreased sharply and the self-financing ratio also declined from 55% in&#13;
1993 to a negative 17% in 1994 and 1995.&#13;
3.42   Although SENELEC's current ratio appears acceptable, its net working capital is tied up in&#13;
customers receivables (CFAF 36 billion by the end of FY 1995, representing about 6.5 months of&#13;
billing). The breakdown of these figures shows rather good performance regarding private consumers&#13;
and chronically bad results for administration and public companies (especially SONEES, the water&#13;
company). If not solved, this situation will generate acute liquidity problems for SENELEC in the future.&#13;
3.43   SENELEC's accounting system includes a special principle which has a significant impact on&#13;
the company's financial statements. SENELEC is allowed to enter in its accounts a deductible provision&#13;
for replacement and maintenance of company's fixed assets. (5 % of the amount of gross fixed assets in&#13;
service at the beginning of the year, except if the annual net income is already negative without this&#13;
provision). Even though this is not really a reserve, it is normally imputed on a special reserve account&#13;
at the end of the year. As this provision is added to the common depreciation of assets, this practice&#13;
allowed SENELEC to constitute an apparently comfortable CFAF 42 billion net reserve at the end of&#13;
1995. However, in real terms, the reserve is more than balanced by the cumulated retained losses (CFAF&#13;
59 billion, at the end of 1995), and it should therefore be converted into equity.&#13;
E.    Sector Reforms&#13;
3.44   The main issues in the sector are the high cost of power, the low level of connections, falling&#13;
level of investments leading to a deteriorating of its production facilities, shortage of generation capacity,&#13;
inefficient management and deteriorating financial performance. The Government and SENELEC&#13;
initiated a number of measures to address the problems facing the company. Beginning in 1993, a Plan&#13;
d'Urgence was adopted, which resulted in a net profit (before special reserve) of 1,937 million FCFA (in&#13;
contrast to a loss of 3,218 million FCFA in 1993). Public sector cross-debts were settled, which resulted&#13;
in a single exceptional payment of 1,900 million FCFA to SENELEC in October 1995. In February 1995,&#13;
SENELEC produced a management document " Plan de redressement durable - periode 1995-1997 ",&#13;
which presents the long term objectives of the company and has been used as a basis by each department&#13;
of SENELEC to define medium- and short-term objectives and management indicators. More recently,&#13;
therefore, the Government in the context of its agreements with the Bank and the IMF has committed&#13;
itself to the privatization of SENELEC, the modification of the regulatory framework to encourage&#13;
private sector investment in generation, and reducing the petroleum costs of SENELEC through the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
liberalization of the petroleum sector (a letter of Sector Development Policy was signed in January&#13;
1997). During credit negotiations agreement was reached with the Government of Senegal on a&#13;
timebound action plan for implementing the reform of Senegal's power sector and the privatization of&#13;
SENELEC (para 8. 1). Annex 3 presents a draft of this action plan.&#13;

(a) In order to allow  a comparison between the three utilities, the net income is presented before the constitution of the special&#13;

3.46   The average tariff level for electricity was CFAF 70.6 per kWh in 1995 (US$ 0.14/kWh). Given&#13;
the financial obligations that SENELEC will face in the future, the average tariff for electricity will need&#13;
to be revised every year upwards from 1996 to 2001 at the rate of internal inflation. From 2002 onwards,&#13;
the purchase of energy to the Manantali operator will lower operating costs and reduce the need for new&#13;
investments. Nevertheless, the previous rate of increase of tariff should continue in prevision of future&#13;
investments, after 2005, when existing facilities, including Manantali will be saturated. The average&#13;
tariff will remain unchanged at about US$97 0.14/kWh, in real terms.&#13;
3.47   On the whole period, SENELEC will benefit from a steady increase of revenues due to both the&#13;
tariff revisions and the steady rise in demand. Total revenues would increase by an average 8.3% per&#13;
year. The operating income will be reinforced from 5% in 1996, to a solid 10% in 2005. The net income&#13;
(before special reserve), will show a strong progression to reach 2% in 2000 and 6% in 2005. This will&#13;
give to SENELEC a comfortable real reserve (38 billion CFAF in cash in 2005) to be used for renewal&#13;
and to self-finance future expansion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
3.48   Until 2005, the investment plan is limited to renewal and network facilities, so the rate-base&#13;
stays rather stable, and the rate of return on rate-base grows from 3% in 1996 to 8% in 2005. Assuming&#13;
the financing of 80% of new investments with new loans, the debt service coverage ratio improves from&#13;
0.9 in 1996 to 1.8 in 2000 and then stays higher than 2.0. The debt equity ratio will remain between 1.1&#13;
and 1.4 throughout the period. Finally, the current ratio will decrease from 1.0 in 1996 to 0.7 in 1999, as&#13;
SENELEC encounters liquidity shortages, and will then rise again to reach 2.3 in 2005.&#13;
3.49   The impact of Manantali: The impact of Manantali energy on SENELEC performance is&#13;
significant, especially in the medium-term. Without Manantali, SENELEC would have to begin an&#13;
expansion program three years earlier (2004 instead of 2007), and even though the total purchases of&#13;
Manantali energy would represent only 15% of SENELEC needs, deferral of generation investment&#13;
should result in important savings. In the absence of Manantali supply, the projections indicate that the&#13;
average tariff would be about 8% higher.&#13;
3.50   Underlying assumptions:  The projections highlight the requirements and measures for&#13;
SENELEC to reach the financial objectives, including the following:&#13;
(a) revision of tariffs in accordance with inflation until 2001 and at a lower rate thereafter;&#13;
(b) improvements in collection of billing and in accounting and commercial procedures (as per&#13;
recommendation of an audit of SENELEC accounts and procedures that should be conducted&#13;
with emphasis on inventory of fixed assets, detailed inventory of receivables, and&#13;
elimination of differences between customer accounting and general accounting).&#13;
(c) stabilization of the staff numbers; and&#13;
(d) reduction of fuel costs.&#13;

4. BANK GROUP STRATEGY AND RATIONALE FOR&#13;
INVOLVEMENT&#13;
4.1    One of the main CAS objectives in all three countries] is to achieve sustained broad-based&#13;
growth by among other things, the promotion of the private sector and the development of infrastructure.&#13;
Another CAS objective is addressing environmental issues. The project would contribute to achieving&#13;
these objectives by providing a reliable supply of electric power at lower cost, contributing to increasing&#13;
the access to electricity of the population in the Senegal river valley and to improving the efficiency of&#13;
the electric power sectors in the three countries, and helping tackle environmental and health issues&#13;
related to the existing dam of Manantali, and the construction of the power plant and transmission lines.&#13;
The project grid will interconnect the major production system of the three countries and make possible&#13;
exchanges of electricity between the three utilities, and will allow in the long-term interconnection of the&#13;
three countries with the regional power transmission grid in Western Africa.&#13;
4.2   The Bank's involvement in developing the Senegal River Basin dates back to the 1960's. In&#13;
1979, it disagreed with OMVS on the rationale for and potential impact of the construction of the Diama&#13;
and Manantali's dams and withdrew its support to OMVS. Ten years later in 1989, the donors and the&#13;
three Governments invited the Bank to participate in the financing of the power component and the&#13;
irrigation schemes in the Senegal valley. This was largely because the OMVS program directly affected&#13;
policies and strategies in agriculture, health, environment, power and transportation sectors which are&#13;
vital to economies of the countries concerned and in which the Bank was involved. These complex&#13;
issues required coordination between three countries under structural adjustment and the three national&#13;
utilities that already receive Bank support.&#13;
4.3   The largest contribution of the Bank (which is providing only about 9% of the financing of the&#13;
project), has been in ensuring the preparation of a viable project, with the most economic and technically&#13;
sound design (in particular, concerning the route and design of the Western transmission line), and&#13;
adequate arrangements for economic management of the Manantali reservoir (through the reservoir&#13;
management optimization study) and mitigation of environment and health impacts. The project has&#13;
been determined as the least-cost option for the expansion of the interconnected systems of Mali,&#13;
Mauritania and Senegal, through the comparison of an all-thermal scenario with a mixed hydro/thermal&#13;
scenario. Although, prospects for private financing have been reviewed and found not viable, the Bank&#13;
was instrumental in OMVS decision to subcontract project operations to a private operator under a 15-&#13;

4.4    The Bank supports a coordinated and integrated approach to issues related to the development of&#13;
the Senegal River Valley. It aims at improving water resource management, rehabilitating and&#13;
expanding irrigation facilities, improving water supply, reducing the prevalence of endemic diseases and&#13;
mitigating environment impacts of projects. To that effect, several projects are under preparation in the&#13;
three countries in coordination with other donors and development agencies, including health sector&#13;
projects in the three countries, endemic disease control in Senegal, integrated valley development in&#13;
Mauritania, and water supply development projects in Mauritania and Senegal. .&#13;
4.5    Bank's involvement in the power sectors of the three countries aims at assisting authorities&#13;
reduce the cost of electricity supply and meet reasonable growth in demand while, at the same time,&#13;
reducing the burden imposed by the sector on Government budgets. Projects are being implemented in&#13;
Mali [Power II Project (Cr.1998-ML) and the Selingue Rehabilitation Project (Cr.2850-ML)] and are&#13;
under preparation in Mauritania and Senegal. The Bank's role is consistent with the Bank policy in the&#13;
power sector (World Bank Policy Papers, the World Bank's Role in the Electric Power Sector, 1993 and&#13;
Rural Energy and Development, 1996), and is essentially catalytic. These aims would be pursued by a&#13;
strategy of:&#13;
(a) improved sector efficiency, by way of strengthening existing power entities, importation of&#13;
services, commercialization, private sector participation and transparent regulation;&#13;
(b) the development of indigenous hydro-resources;&#13;
(c) the promotion of regional interconnection of power and energy;&#13;
(d) efficiency measures, including economic pricing of electricity;&#13;
(e) the promotion of rural electrification through decentralization schemes and private involvement;&#13;
and&#13;
(f) the reduction of financial burden on public finances in the three countries.&#13;

5. THE PROJECT&#13;
A.        Background&#13;
5.1    The Manantali dam, commissioned in 1988, is located on the Bafing River, a tributary of the&#13;
Senegal river some 1,200 km upstream from the mouth of the river at Saint-Louis. Its construction was&#13;
financed by Arab donors, IDB, Italy, ADB, CFD, KfW, ACDI and the European Union for about&#13;
US$500 million. The structure consists of a 1,460 meter long rock-filled dike, flanking a central&#13;
concrete structure 493 meters long and 65 meters high . The spillway crest is at 208 meters above sea&#13;
level and the average hydrostatic head on the turbines will be 40 meters. The altitude at the top of the&#13;
concrete structure is 212 meters above sea level. The reservoir created by the dam has a shoreline of&#13;
about 150 km. The volume of water retained at elevation 208 meters is 11.3 billion m3, with a lake&#13;
2&#13;
surface of 477 km . At the minimum operating level of the lake of 187 meters, the volume of stored&#13;
water is reduced to 3.4 billion m3 with a surface of 275 km2.&#13;
B.    Project Objectives&#13;
5.2   The project's main objectives are to: (a) reduce the long-term cost of electricity supply to the&#13;
three countries; (b) contribute to meeting debt service associated with the building of the Manantali dam;&#13;
(c) contribute to increasing the efficiency and reliability of power systems in the three countries; (d)&#13;
establish an effective organization to construct and operate the project facilities and to mitigate&#13;
environment and health impacts of the project and the Manantali dam; (e) promote competitive private&#13;
sector participation in project exploitation as well as in financing of future generation projects in the&#13;
valley; and (f) support the traditional agricultural sector downstream through the rational management of&#13;
the Manantali reservoir. By tying with the national power systems of OMVS three member states, the&#13;
power supply from Manantali would also encourage cooperation and coordination between these&#13;
member countries and allow electricity exchanges between the power utilities. The project transmission&#13;
grid could also be interconnected at a later stage to the Western African System.&#13;
C.        Project Description&#13;
5.3    The Regional Hydropower project would finance the installation of 200 MW  of power&#13;
generation capacity at the Manantali dam, that would provide about 800 GWh in an average hydrology&#13;
year, to be economically dispatched to Mali, Mauritania and Senegal through transmission lines totaling&#13;
about 1,300 km. In order to provide electricity to the population living along the Senegal Valley and to&#13;
the population in eastern Mali, the project would also include a 87 km long 90 kV line from Matam to&#13;
Kaedi and several substations located at Sakal, Dagana, Rosso, Matam, Kaedi, Kayes, Kita, and&#13;
Kodialani. The general layout of both systems is shown on Map IBRD 28332, while a single-line&#13;
diagram appears in Figure I in AnnexA, which contains the detailed description of the following project&#13;
components:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
Component A: Power Station&#13;
5.4   This includes: (a) civil works for the power station and dispatching center at Manantali; (b)&#13;
electromechanical equipment (5 units of 40 MW each); (c) a step-up substation; and (d) reinforcement&#13;
works on the Manantali dam. Estimated base cost: US$130 million.&#13;
Component B: Transmission system&#13;
5.5   This includes: (a) a 225 kV single-circuit transmission line (306 km) to Bamako and three&#13;
substations at Kita, Kodialani and Sirakoro, where the line will meet the existing 150 kV transmission&#13;
system at Sirakoro; (b) a 225 kV single-circuit transmission line (820 km) to Sakal in Senegal and&#13;
substations at Kayes, Matam, Dagana and Sakal where the line will connect with the existing Tobene-&#13;
Sakal 220 kV transmission line; (c) a 225 kV transmission line from Dagana to Rosso in Mauritania; (d)&#13;
a 132 kV single-circuit transmission line to Nouakchott (225 km) with substations at Rosso and&#13;
Nouakchott and a 90 kV line from Matam at Kaedi (87 km) with a substation in Kaedi; and (e) a&#13;
dispatching center at Manantali and equipment to link it to the three national dispatching centers.&#13;
Estimated base cost: US$196 million.&#13;
Component C: Supervision&#13;
5.6   This consists of services of consultants for the supervision of construction of all components&#13;
until project completion and includes assistance for bid evaluation and staff training of the implementing&#13;
agency (SOGEM). Estimated base cost: US$15.6 million&#13;
Component D: Institutional Strengthening&#13;
5.7   This includes:&#13;
(a) support to the two implementing agencies (SOGEM and OMVS High Commission), including:&#13;
(i) assistance with the recruitment of a private operator for the management and operation of&#13;
project facilities; (ii) assistance with the implementation of the environmental mitigation and&#13;
monitoring plan; (iii) support to establishment/review of tariff principles and mechanisms and&#13;
energy purchase agreements;&#13;
(b) studies relating to the reservoir management optimization program, mitigating measures for&#13;
environment (health, traditional agriculture, etc.), promoting electrification of the Senegal valley&#13;
and development of new hydroelectric sites;&#13;
(c) training of SOGEM and OMVS High Commission staff;&#13;
(d) acquisition of related equipment, materials and vehicles; and&#13;
(e) operating costs of SOGEM and OMVS High Commission during the construction of the project&#13;
(to be entirely financed by the Governments), Estimated base cost: US$37.8 million.&#13;
Component E: PPF refinancing&#13;
5.8    Refinancing of the Project Preparation Facility Advance (PPF). Cost: US$2.6 million&#13;
D.        Project Costs&#13;
5.9   The proposed project total cost, including physical and price contingencies, but excluding&#13;
interest during construction, is estimated at US$433 million, of which the foreign exchange component is&#13;
estimated at US$341 million (79%). A detailed summary of costs is shown in the table below. Cost&#13;
estimates are based on September 1996 prices. Physical contingencies varies from 5% to 10% depending&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
on the type and degree of project preparation of each project component. Contingencies are lower for&#13;
electromechanical equipment and for those components for which bidding is well advanced. Price&#13;
contingencies have been computed assuming an implementation period of three years and a 2.3%&#13;
escalation of the UVIME index (Unit Value Index of Manufactured Exports). The local inflation rate is&#13;
based on the most recent estimates made by IMF and World Bank staff and is estimated at 2.6% per year.&#13;
Taxes and import duties are not included in the project cost, as OMVS is currently exempt from import&#13;
taxes and custom duties.&#13;

E.        Project Financing Plan&#13;
5.10      The total financing required is estimated at US$445 million equivalent, including interest&#13;
during construction (IDC). IDA has tentatively allocated US$ 38.7 million equivalent to the project.&#13;
France would provide US$ 95 million (including interest during construction), Canada US$ 27 million,&#13;
Germany US$ 66 million, African Development Bank (FAD) US$ 26 million, Islamic Development&#13;
Bank US$ 21 million, the European Community US$ 37 million, the European Investment Bank US$ 46&#13;
million, West African Development Bank US$ 20 million, The Nordic Development Fund US$8 million&#13;
and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (FADES) US$29 million. The Governments&#13;
would provide US$31 million to finance part of the local costs as well as IDC. Provision of counterpart&#13;
funds by OMVS and SOGEM, in particular regarding SOGEM expenses until project completion, was&#13;
agreed upon during credit negotiations (para 8.1). The detailed financing plan is presented in Annex 5-&#13;
As a condition of credit effectiveness, cofinancing agreements will have to be executed on behalf of&#13;
Governments and cofinanciers of the civil works contract [Lot 3] (para 8.2).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
5.11      IDA would provide a credit of US$17.1 million to Mali, US$ 1 1.0 million to Mauritania and&#13;
US$ 10.5 million to Senegal (Table 5.3). These amounts reflect agreements with IDB and BOAD on&#13;
joint financing for the civil works component (Lot 3) and the overall project cost distribution agreed&#13;
upon between the three countries (cle generale de repartition; Mali 35.3%, Mauritania 22.6% and&#13;
Senegal 42.1%). The equivalent of US$2.6 million from the Mali credit will be used to refinance the&#13;
PPF advance. Final beneficiaries of IDA financing would be OMVS High Commission (US$7.9 million&#13;
equivalent) and SOGEM (US$30.8 million equivalent). Funds to SOGEM would be onlent by the three&#13;
Governments on IBRD terms. Terms of onlending to SOGEM were agreed during credit negotiations&#13;
(para 8.1), as well as the passing on as a grant to OMVS High Commission of funds necessary to finance&#13;
the institutional component of the project. Signature of subsidiary financial agreements between the&#13;
three Member States and both SOGEM and OMVS High Commission will be a condition of credit&#13;
effectiveness (para 8.2). Ratification of the credit agreements by all three countries is a condition of&#13;
effectiveness of the three credits (para. 8.2).&#13;
F.        Project Preparation and Implementation&#13;
5.12   The project has been under preparation since the 1980s with the assistance of German, French,&#13;
Canadian, Belgian and English consultants. Alternatives that were reviewed related to technical and&#13;
financial aspects, as well as making trade-offs in water use for irrigation and flood recession agriculture,&#13;
power generation, water supply and navigation. When initially designed, the project was to serve only&#13;
the areas surrounding the Manantali dam. However, with the oil crisis of the early 80s, the objective was&#13;
changed so that power could be supplied to the capital cities, which are the largest consumers of&#13;
electricity. Several transmission routes to Dakar were evaluated from an economic point of view, which&#13;
led to many years of debate among the donors, OMVS and the three countries. The route currently&#13;
adopted is economically and technically sound. There was a similar debate with regards to the design of&#13;
the transmission line, as to whether it should be a single-circuit or double-circuit line. It was finally&#13;
agreed to opt for the single circuit design, which was confirmed to be technically feasible and reduced&#13;
project costs by more than US$80 million. Given the length of the transmission lines, it was of utmost&#13;
importance to be fully sure that the transmission system would be stable and that the designed&#13;
transmission capability could actually be achieved. For these reasons, engineering designs have been&#13;
reviewed by an internationally-known expert in this discipline and his recommendations have been&#13;
incorporated in the final engineering designs.&#13;
5.13   There were similar discussions as to when Nouakchott should be connected and the most recent&#13;
studies confirmed that the corresponding transmission line should be built at the same time as the rest of&#13;
the Western line. The project has been determined as the least-cost option for the expansion of the&#13;
interconnected systems of Mali, Mauritania and Senegal, through the comparison of an all-thermal&#13;
scenario with a mixed hydro/thermal scenario. Prospects for private financing have also been reviewed&#13;
and found not feasible. Lack of interest in the project financing by the private sector was further&#13;
evidenced through informal contacts made by the Bank with promoters of private power projects and can&#13;
be explained partly because of the complexity of the project, but largely because of the political and&#13;
sovereign risks covering three countries, two of which have been at war a few years ago and one country&#13;
that did not belong to the CFA Franc zone. However, because of increasing demand for power in the&#13;
three countries and the need under the proposed project for a rational exchange of power between the&#13;
utilities, there is likely to be increased interest by the private sector to invest in future power generation&#13;
projects, particularly in thermal generation in Senegal and possibly hydroelectric sites along the Senegal&#13;
river, and to wheel part of the energy produced to Mali and Mauritania through the project transmission&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
grid. Also, the reforms envisaged by the three governments in the power sectors would lead to increased&#13;
private participation in the future in particular in commercial operations.&#13;
5.14   Detailed engineering studies have now been completed for all proposed facilities and bids called&#13;
for have been received and already evaluated for both civil works and the electromechanical equipment&#13;
of the power station. In the case of civil works, bids were received on May 5, 1997 and are in the&#13;
process of being evaluated. Bids have been called for the eastern transmission line and bidding&#13;
documents are in an advanced preparation stage for the western line and dispatching equipment.&#13;
Acquisition of right-of-way for the transmission lines is underway as well as the task of physically&#13;
spotting towers along the corridors. Location of substations has been decided and land acquisition has&#13;
been initiated.&#13;
5.15   The complexity of the project, due to its technical features, the significant financing required and&#13;
the involvement of three countries and twelve potential donors, required extensive coordination and&#13;
cooperation. The project implies energy exchanges between utilities, sound technical scope, economic&#13;
management of water resources, an autonomous private operator, an efficient tariff system and healthy&#13;
utilities (the three customers). All these elements have been assessed through studies and from&#13;
experience in other countries and have been taken into account in project design and conditionalities.&#13;
The involvement of three countries, three utilities and an entity without previous Bank lending&#13;
experience (OMYS) has resulted in a long preparation process, in particular for aspects relating to the&#13;
environment, reservoir management, private sector involvement, tariffs and cost recovery, and project&#13;
economics and risk mitigation. Experience with regional power projects in neighboring countries (Togo,&#13;
Benin) shows that such projects can work well, but it has also shown that the issues to address can be&#13;
complex and that preparatory work can be time-consuming. Although the Diama and Manantali dams&#13;
have been in operation since 1985 and 1988 respectively, it took almost 10 years to come to closure on&#13;
the Manantali power component.&#13;
5.16   There is total ownership of the project on the part of OMVS and the three Governments. The&#13;
preparation of the project was handled exclusively by OMVS with financing from various donors and the&#13;
commitment is evidenced from the number of complex and sensitive agreements that have been reached&#13;
on routing, privatization of management, water resources management, health and environment issues,&#13;
tariffs, organization, etc. Delays in project preparation can almost exclusively be linked to project&#13;
complexity, rather than weak commitment on the part of OMVS and the Governments.&#13;
5.17   Adequate donors coordination was ensured by the Caisse Franqaise de Developpement and has&#13;
been a key element in establishing the project scope and justification and in securing financing from&#13;
twelve donors. Several donors meetings and join preparation missions have taken place during the last&#13;
three years. A workshop was organized by OMVS in November 1995 to review experiences in reservoir&#13;
management and define the detailed terms of reference for the program optimizing the management of&#13;
the reservoirs of Manantali and Diama. A workshop was organized in June 1996 with participation of&#13;
the Governments and the three utilities, to finalize the institutional framework of the project and discuss&#13;
tariff issues. Another workshop took place in March 1997 for finalizing the agreements to be reached on&#13;
tariff mechanisms and principles between the utilities, the Governments and SOGEM. Extensive&#13;
consultation of stakeholders took place during the preparation of the environment assessment and during&#13;
the finalization of the environment mitigation and monitoring plan from January to March 1997 and will&#13;
also occur during project implementation.&#13;
5.18   Contracts for the construction of the power station are expected to be awarded in July 1997.&#13;
Work is expected to start by September 1997. Construction of lines and power substations would start in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
the beginning of 1998. Construction of the Eastern system would be completed by mid-2000 and the&#13;
western system would be completed by mid-2001. The five turbines would be in place between October&#13;
2000 to October 2001. A detailed schedule of works is provided in Annex 8. OMVS has finalized a&#13;
detailed Project Implementation Plan (PIP). Agreement was reached during credit negotiations on the&#13;
final PIP (para. 8.1), taking into account changes since project appraisal in December 1996. An&#13;
independent group of engineering firms (the Engineer) has been recruited to supervise the construction of&#13;
the project. The recruitment of the private operator charged of the operation and maintenance of the&#13;
project and Manantali dam facilities should be completed at least one year before project construction&#13;
completion.&#13;
5.19   A satisfactory timetable has been submitted for the start of SOGEM's operations and the&#13;
restructuring of the OMVS High Commission before October 1997. The establishment of satisfactory&#13;
administrative, financial and accounting procedures by SOGEM and OMVS High Commission is a&#13;
condition of credit effectiveness (para. 8.2). An outline of the contract between SOGEM and the private&#13;
operator has been prepared, including provisions to induce bill collection from the SNEs and fee&#13;
payment to SOGEM. The agreement creating SOGEM was signed by the Heads of State in January 1997&#13;
and ratified by the Parliaments of the three countries. The draft Statutes of SOGEM have been discussed&#13;
and agreed upon during credit negotiations (para. 8.1); the reduction of the number of SOGEM's Board&#13;
members from nine to six will be considered by OMVS Council of Ministers, after a year of SOGEM's&#13;
operations. OMVS has selected SOGEM's Director General. During credit negotiations, an agreement&#13;
was reached on the project verifiable performance indicators for SOGEM and OMVS High Commission&#13;
(para 8.1). Technical specifications for the operation of the Manantali dam by SOGEM will be finalized&#13;
and approved by SOGEM's Board before September 1, 1997, based on an earlier draft prepared by&#13;
OMVS. The draft organization, budget and procedures of SOGEM were agreed to during credit&#13;
negotiations (para. 8.1), as well as the scope and timetable of preparatory activities necessary to enable&#13;
SOGEM to start its operations by September 1997. A satisfactory timetable for the release of SOGEM's&#13;
subscribed capital by the three Governments is a condition of credit effectiveness (para. 8.2). OMVS&#13;
restructuring has been approved by the OMVS Council of Ministers. The draft budget, organization and&#13;
procedures of the restructured OMVS High Commission were agreed upon during credit negotiations&#13;
(para. 8.1). In view of past budgetary difficulties of OMVS, a condition of credit effectiveness is the&#13;
evidence that sufficient funds have been made available to OMVS High Commission to cover its project-&#13;
related operating expenditures for 1997 and a sufficient provision for 1998 and that satisfactory&#13;
arrangements have been made for making available to SOGEM sufficient funds to cover its operating&#13;
expenditures during the project implementation period, 1997-2001 (para 8.2). The process of recruitment&#13;
of the private operator on the basis of an open international consultation would include the following&#13;
steps: prequalification of operators presenting sufficient technical references in the field of hydropower&#13;
works management and adequate financial references, pre-bid conference, finalization of bidding&#13;
documents and bidding in two phases (technical and financial). Terms of reference and detailed steps&#13;
and timetable for the recruitment of the private operator before April 2000 are presented in Annex 6 and&#13;
were agreed upon during credit negotiations (para. 8.1).&#13;
G.        Procurement&#13;
5.20  In general, the three Member States' procurement laws and regulation do not conflict with IDA&#13;
Guidelines. No special exemptions, permits, or licenses need to be specified in the Credit documents for&#13;
International Competitive Bidding (ICB), since the three Members State's procurement practices allow&#13;
IDA procedures to take precedence over any provisions in local regulations. All items financed by IDA&#13;
will be procured in accordance with IDA's Procurement Guidelines (January 1995, revised in January&#13;
and August 1996), and the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents have been and will be used. All&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
procurement following National Competitive Bidding (NCB) will be financed under the credit to Mali.&#13;
Procurement under NCB will be advertised in the three Member States, and will be carried out in&#13;
accordance with Malian procedures acceptable to IDA, provided that: (a) bidders are given sufficient&#13;
time to submit bids (three to four weeks for contracts exceeding US$25,000); (b) bid evaluation and&#13;
criteria are clearly specified in bidding documents; (c) eligible firmns are not precluded from&#13;
participation; (d) contracts provide for security in an amount sufficient to protect the borrower in case of&#13;
breach of contract (without distinction or exception); (e) prior to issuing the first call for bids, draft&#13;
standard bidding documents are submitted to IDA and found acceptable; and (f) the award will be made&#13;
to the lowest evaluated bidder.&#13;

(') One contract, estimated to cost US$63.1 million, jointly financed by IDA, BOAD and IDB using Bank Standard&#13;
Bidding Documents.&#13;
5.22   Scope of procurement. The major part (US$28.5 million) of the IDA Credits (US$38.7 million)&#13;
will be used to finance the civil works contract for the construction of the power station, the step-up&#13;
transformer and dam reinforcement, which will also be cofinanced by IDB (US$2 1.0 million) and BOAD&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
(US$12.9 million). It has already been agreed with IDB and BOAD that each donor will disburse&#13;
simultaneously the amounts according to its share of the contract financing. The remaining part of the&#13;
credit will be used to finance consultant services, equipment and to refinance the PPF advance.&#13;
Consultant services contracts financed by IDA (totaling US$5.0 million) include: (a) support to the&#13;
project's implementation agencies (SOGEM and OMVS High Commission); (b) training; (c) studies&#13;
(reservoir management plan, environmental and health mitigation plans), audits, and short-term&#13;
specialists as needed.&#13;
5.23   Civil Works. The major contract for civil works described above for the power station&#13;
(estimated at US$63.1 million) out of which IDA participation is US$28.5 million will be procured&#13;
under ICB procedures, following a prequalification process -- already completed in accordance with&#13;
bank's procedures and to the satisfaction of all donors. Donors involved in this contract have agreed to&#13;
use Bank's SBDs. Small works relating to the health mitigation plan (bunding, erosion protection, etc.)&#13;
financed by IDA (totaling US$0.6 million) would be procured under Malian NCB procedures, and&#13;
advertised in the three Member's States.&#13;
5.24   Goods. For procurement of goods (computers and vehicles), to the extent practicable, contracts&#13;
shall be grouped in bid packages estimated to cost US$100,000 equivalent or more each, and procured&#13;
through ICB. Goods (office supplies, furniture and equipment) estimated to cost less than US$100,000&#13;
equivalent per contract up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$500,000 equivalent, may be&#13;
procured under Malian National Competitive Bidding, and advertised in the three Member's States.&#13;
Goods which cannot be grouped into packages of US$50,000 or more equivalent per contract, may be&#13;
procured on the basis of International Shopping up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$ 100,000, or&#13;
on the basis of National Shopping for office supplies and equipment available at economical prices up to&#13;
an aggregate amount not to exceed $200,000 equivalent.&#13;
5.25   Consultant services contracts would be awarded in accordance with Bank's Guidelines for the&#13;
selection and employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (January 1997). Selection of&#13;
consultants will be addressed through competition among qualified short-listed firns in which the&#13;
selection will be based on Quality-Based and Cost Selection (QBCS), except for the following: (i) audits&#13;
of a standard nature estimated to cost less than US$200,000 per contract which will use the Least Cost&#13;
Selection, (ii) studies for reservoir management and for the health mitigation plan estimated to cost less&#13;
than US$100,000 which may be procured under Consultants' Qualifications Selection, and (iii) advisory&#13;
services, lectures and small studies which could be delivered by individual consultants and which will be&#13;
selected through comparison of qualifications among those expressing interest in the assignment or&#13;
approached directly. The short list of consultants for services for the strengthening of the administrative&#13;
and financial management capacities of SOGEM and the OMVS High Commission, estimated to cost&#13;
less than $200,000 equivalent per contract, may comprise entirely consulting firms from the three&#13;
Member States, provided those firms with experience required are in a sufficient number (at least three).&#13;
However, if foreign firms have expressed interest, they will not be excluded from consideration.&#13;
5.26   Review by IDA: All IDA-financed contracts for works and goods above a threshold value of&#13;
US$100,000 will be subject to IDA's prior review procedures. For contracts for works and goods&#13;
estimated to cost less than US$100,000 and more than US$50,000, the Borrower will provide to IDA: (i)&#13;
prior to the selection of any supplier, a report on the comparison and evaluation of quotations received,&#13;
and (ii) prior to the execution of any contract procured under shopping procedures, a copy of the&#13;
specifications and the draft contract. For consultant services, the Bank will review the selection process&#13;
proposed by the Borrower. Prior IDA review will not apply to contracts for the recruitment of consulting&#13;
firms and individuals estimated to cost less than US$100,000 and US$50,000 equivalent respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
However, the exception to prior IDA review will not apply to the Terms of Reference of such contracts,&#13;
regardless of value, to single-source hiring, to assignments of a critical nature as determined by IDA or&#13;
to amendments of contracts raising the contract value above the prior review threshold. For consultant&#13;
contracts estimated above US$200,000, opening the financial envelopes will not take place before&#13;
receiving the bank's no-objection to the technical evaluation. For contracts estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$200,000 and more than US$100,000 the borrower will notify IDA of the results of the technical&#13;
evaluation prior to opening the financial proposals. Documents related to procurement below the prior&#13;
review thresholds will be maintained by the borrowers for ex-post review by auditors and by IDA&#13;
supervision missions.&#13;
5.27   Procurement Readiness, Schedule and Supervision Arrangements. Advance procurement&#13;
for civil-works has been made in accordance with Bank procurement guidelines. The award of the civil&#13;
works contract by SOGEM is a condition of credit effectiveness (para. 8.2). This is consistent with bid&#13;
opening that took place on May 5, 1997 (three bids received). With the current project processing&#13;
schedule, no retroactive financing will be necessary for these works. During project implementation,&#13;
SOGEM will benefit from the assistance of a French, German and Canadian consortium of firms for&#13;
supervision of all the works. A detailed procurement schedule for works, goods, and services to be&#13;
procured under the project is provided in Annex 8. It will be updated by SOGEM on a regular basis.&#13;
During implementation, all bidding documents, bid evaluation reports, and draft contracts transmitted to&#13;
IDA for review will contain an updated copy of the procurement plan. To ensure timely project&#13;
implementation, SOGEM and OMVS High Commission will take the necessary measures to ensure that&#13;
procurement phases do not exceed the following target time periods:&#13;
Maximum Number of Weeks&#13;
Preparation of Bidding Documents                 4 (12 for large contracts)&#13;
Preparation of Bids by Bidders                   4 (12 for ICB)&#13;
Bid Evaluation                                   2 (4 for large contracts)&#13;
Signature of Contracts                           2&#13;
Payments                                         3&#13;
H.        Disbursements&#13;
5.28   The proposed project is expected to be fully disbursed by June 30, 2002 in accordance with the&#13;
estimated schedule in Annex 7. To facilitate project implementation, during credit negotiations&#13;
agreement was reached that SOGEM and OMVS High Commission will each open a Special Account in&#13;
a commercial bank which will be tied to the Mali credit since Mali is the main beneficiary of IDA&#13;
financing (para. 8.1) and since the Mauritania and Senegal credits will only finance the civil works&#13;
contract with large payments exceeding US$100,000 and paid directly by IDA. IDA would finance one&#13;
major contract under Component A of the project and several smaller contracts under Components C and&#13;
D. As a consequence, the credit to Mali would fully finance envisaged expenditures under Components&#13;
C and D (studies and equipment for SOGEM and OMVS High Commission). The two Special Accounts&#13;
will have an authorized allocation of CFAF 200 million with a first authorized increment of CFAF 100&#13;
million. Once payments through the Special Account will have totaled CFAF 300 million, the fully&#13;
authorized amount will be paid. The accounts will be used to pay for eligible expenditures financed by&#13;
IDA. They will be replenished on a monthly basis or when it is reduced by one-third, whichever comes&#13;
first. Disbursement of the IDA credit will be fully documented except for contracts valued at less than&#13;
US$100,000 (US$50,000 for individual consultant contract) which will be disbursed against statements&#13;
of expenditures (SOEs). All IDA expenditures of less than US$100,000 equivalent will be paid from the&#13;
Special Account. The proposed IDA credit will be disbursed as follows:&#13;

1.         Accounts, Auditing, and Reporting&#13;
5.29    During credit negotiations, it was agreed that SOGEM and the OMVS High Commission shall:&#13;
(a) maintain records and accounts in accordance with sound accounting practices (International&#13;
Accounting Standards); (b) have their records, accounts and financial statements audited by independent&#13;
auditors acceptable to the Association; and (c) furnish, not later than June 30 each year, certified copies&#13;
of its financial statements and the report of such audits (para. 8. 1).&#13;
5.30   In order to ensure efficient monitoring, agreement was reached during credit negotiations on&#13;
the following: (a) OMVS High Commission and SOGEM would submit semi-annual progress reports to&#13;
IDA; (b) representatives of OMVS High Commission, SOGEM, the Governments and IDA would meet&#13;
twice a year to review progress in the implementation of the project on the basis of verifiable&#13;
performance indicators previously agreed upon, (c) a mid-term review would take place approximately&#13;
two and a half years after credit effectiveness, with particular attention to the recruitment of the private&#13;
operator, the Manantali reservoir management program, the PASIE implementation, the situation of the&#13;
power sectors in the three countries and the update of the tariff agreement; and (d) the Governments&#13;
would submit to IDA a joint project Implementation Completion Report within six months after credit&#13;
closing date (para. 8. 1).&#13;
J.          Environmental, Social and Health Impacts&#13;
5.31    Two Environmental Assessment (EA) studies were conducted by OMVS in the last few years&#13;
with support of internationally renowned firms, and in close coordination with the preparation of bidding&#13;
documents for project components, in particular transmission lines and civil works. OMVS has prepared&#13;
a synthesis of the EA studies, as well as a comprehensive environmental impact mitigation and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
monitoring plan (PASIE) including detailed costs and financing plan, with the assistance of&#13;
internationally experienced environmental management consultants. The EA, the EA Summary and the&#13;
PASIE have been disclosed in the three countries. The Canadian Government executed an independent&#13;
evaluation of the environmental impacts and mitigation plan of the project. The results of this&#13;
independent evaluation are in line with the results of the EAs conducted by OMVS. The EA studies&#13;
foresee only very limited impacts of the project on the environment, caused mainly by the 30 meter&#13;
corridor to accommodate power transmission lines and maintenance roads.&#13;
5.32   The main environmental impacts are not caused by the proposed Regional Hydropower&#13;
Development Project, but rather by the Manantali and Diama dams on the Senegal River, which have&#13;
already been constructed. However, it is impossible to mitigate the impacts of the hydropower project&#13;
only, without addressing the problems created by the management of the dams themselves. Therefore,&#13;
the mitigation plan of the proposed hydropower development project will take into account the partial&#13;
mitigation of some of the most serious environmental and health impacts of the two dams.&#13;
5.33   With respect to resettlement and related issues, the major social impacts of the proposed regional&#13;
hydropower development project are the partial/permanent loss of property and land use rights.&#13;
Partial/permanent loss of agricultural land will be primarily the result of land taken in order to establish&#13;
the transmission towers and substations, access roads and construction work areas. The routing of the&#13;
transmission lines has been chosen to avoid as much as possible sensitive ecosystems and protected areas&#13;
such as forest areas, cultural sites and natural habitats for migratory species. For the major part the&#13;
transmission lines pass through open plains with scattered trees and light bushes, the typical Sahelian&#13;
landscape.&#13;
5.34   The main potential impacts of transmission lines will be in the more densely populated areas,&#13;
such as around Bamako and at the Senegal river crossing at Dagana. Impacts will be limited in the areas&#13;
outside the Senegal River floodplain and in the higher river basin.&#13;
5.35   The PASIE has been finalized by OMVS in May 1997. It includes five components to be&#13;
implemented under the supervision of OMVS High Commission and SOGEM: (i) mitigation of impacts&#13;
during construction; (ii) involuntary resettlement and compensation program; (iii) optimization of&#13;
Manantali reservoir management; (iv) health component; and (v) environment monitoring during project&#13;
operations.  The PASIE contains adequate dispositions for resettlement and land acquisition, in&#13;
accordance with OD 4.30. On the basis of the land tenure legislation of each of the three countries,&#13;
detailed land acquisition plans and compensation mechanisms for loss of property and land use rights&#13;
have been prepared for the three different transmission lines. Conditions for the implementation of the&#13;
relevant procedures are specified, including a fair compensation scheme and available means of redress.&#13;
Detailed actions and budget to carry out resettlement and land acquisition in the framework of the PASIE&#13;
were agreed during credit Negotiations (para. 8. 1).&#13;
5.36   The Manantali Reservoir will be operated as a multi-purpose reservoir in accordance with a&#13;
Reservoir Management Agreement between the three Member-States. This agreement and the related&#13;
reservoir management manual will be prepared in the framework of the Reservoir Management&#13;
Optimization Program, financed  under the project (see Annex 10 and Annex.11). Final terms of&#13;
reference for preparing the Manantali Reservoir Management Agreement were agreed during credit&#13;
negotiations (para. 8. 1), as part of the PASIE. This program is an essential part of the overall mitigation&#13;
plan. The installation and operation of the hydropower plant includes the creation of an optimized&#13;
artificial flood and will cause limited changes in the hydrological regime of the Senegal river&#13;
downstream of the dam, as compared to the existing situation without the hydropower plant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
5.37   It is expected that the artificial flood, except in the driest years, will re-establish for a&#13;
considerable part the traditional floodplain functions impacted by the Manantali Dam, which include&#13;
considerable increases in flood recession agriculture, dry season pastures and crop residues, an increase&#13;
in fish production, which is linearly related to the area covered by the flood and its duration and a&#13;
possible regeneration of forest resources, which are also strongly dependent on improved management.&#13;
There is also a possible improved recharge of nearby shallow aquifers, which are used for village water&#13;
supply systems. To monitor the impacts of the artificial flood a comprehensive monitoring system will&#13;
be put in place, including field evaluation, which will allow timely detection of negative and positive&#13;
trends.&#13;
5.38   The creation of the Manantali Reservoir has increased the incidence rates of bilharzia, including&#13;
the intestinal form of bilharzia. The project will investigate measures to reduce incidence rates to&#13;
acceptable levels. At present bilharzia snail vector and prevalence rate baseline data are being established&#13;
and a monitoring program has started. Patients will be treated and a health education program will be&#13;
initiated by the Schistosomiasis Program of the Republic of Mali.&#13;
5.39   After the creation of the Diama Reservoir, with its constant water level, there was and still is an&#13;
explosion of intestinal bilharzia. The most affected areas are Canal de Taouey and Lake Guiers and to a&#13;
lesser extent around the Diama Reservoir in Senegal. Although the proposed regional hydropower&#13;
development project does not involve the Diama dam, the project will nevertheless establish several pilot&#13;
projects to investigate practical and least-cost measures, including artificial water level fluctuations in&#13;
the Diama Reservoir, to reduce the man-snail vector contact and to reduce in this manner the&#13;
transmission and incidence rate of intestinal bilharzia on both the Senegalese and the Mauritanian side.&#13;
The EU financed ESPOIR project executes the bilharzia control and treatment activities, while the health&#13;
education component will be financed under the upcoming IDA financed Bank Senegal Endemic Disease&#13;
Control Project. Other projects which would address the remaining health impacts, such as community&#13;
based water supply around Richard Toll, the bilharzia snail vector habitat elimination in the CSS sugar&#13;
cane area are listed in Annex 11.&#13;
5.40   Local populations, key stakeholders and beneficiaries have been consulted during the preparation&#13;
of the EA and PASIE and they will participate in the implementation of the PASIE through the local&#13;
coordination committees that will be created with the financial support of the Bank. The Environmental&#13;
Management Plan includes the preliminary identification of further consultation needed at the level of&#13;
local communities, during and after construction.&#13;
5.41   The implementation of the project will be coupled with the strengthening of OMVS'&#13;
environmental management capacity. In this context, it is to be noted that the French govemment is&#13;
financing the establishment of an Environmental Monitoring Office within OMVS (Observatoire de&#13;
1'Environnement). This office will develop environmental indicators and establish an adequate and&#13;
demand driven environmental monitoring system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
5.42   Dam Safety. An inspection of the dam and electromechanical equipment conducted by a&#13;
reputable independent group of engineers in June-July 1996 revealed no major flaws and confirmed that&#13;
adequate staffing, procedures and instrumentation were in place for operating and monitoring the&#13;
existing facilities. Civil works for the power substation will include all remedial work identified during&#13;
the inspection. Additional information has been submitted by the engineer concerning possible seepage&#13;
under the dam and uplift in the pelite rock area, which shows that these problems will be addressed&#13;
satisfactorily through the above remedial work.&#13;
K.    Poverty Impact&#13;
5.43   The project will allow increasing the supply of electricity to low income rural communities and&#13;
existing and potential productive activities in the Senegal River Valley at a significantly lower cost than&#13;
the energy sources presently used (small diesel generators, kerosene lamps, candles, etc.). The supply of&#13;
electricity to the three capital cities will also be increased at least cost which will benefit in particular&#13;
low income households that are currently not connected to the distribution network.&#13;
5.44   By addressing some of the key impacts of the existing dam, the project will also improve the&#13;
situation of low income rural communities in the river valley and around the dam, with regard to health&#13;
and agricultural aspects. The reservoir management optimization program, prepared under the project,&#13;
will contribute to improve the artificial flood regime for purposes of traditional agriculture, which is vital&#13;
for low income rural households. The project includes a component to mitigate man-vector transmission&#13;
of bilharzia, the prevalence of which will be addressed in the reservoir management program (through&#13;
fluctuation of reservoir levels).&#13;
&#13;

6. INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
A.    Institutional Framework&#13;
6.1    Background. The Organization for the Development of the Senegal River (OMVS) was created&#13;
in 1992 to promote the economic development of the Senegal River Basin for purposes of irrigation,&#13;
power supply and navigation. OMVS is headed by a High Commissioner who is appointed for a period&#13;
of four years. He reports to the Council of Ministers which consists of a Minister of each country&#13;
responsible for OMVS. The headquarters of OMVS is Dakar, Senegal but it has offices in Saint-Louis,&#13;
Rosso and at the sites of the Diama and Manantali dams. It has a staff of about 245, of which 105 are in&#13;
Dakar. OMVS's budget for 1994 was 1.5 billion FCFA (US$530,000 at an exchange rate of US$1 = 280&#13;
FCFA).&#13;
6.2    OMVS main investments to date have been (a) the construction of the Diama dam at the mouth&#13;
of the Senegal River which was initiated in 1981 and completed in 1986; (b) the construction of the&#13;
Manantali dam, about 1,000 km inland, on the Bafing River, a tributary of the Senegal River, which was&#13;
initiated in 1982 and completed in 1988; it took four years, however, for the reservoir to fill up to the 208&#13;
m level; (iii) the construction of a 76 km long dike on the right bank of the Senegal River and other&#13;
works which were initiated in 1988 and completed in 1994; (iv) the rehabilitation and elevation of a 50&#13;
km dike on the left bank of the Senegal River which was completed in 1994. These four projects cost a&#13;
total of FCFA 204 billion (US$728 million at an exchange rate of FCFA 280 = US$1) as follows:&#13;

6.3    Studies for the Diama dam were financed by France and for the Manantali dam by Germany.&#13;
Other donors involved in carrying out studies were Italy, UNDP and USAID. The financing of these&#13;
projects came from 13 different donors. About 35% of the financing was outright grants (FCFA 82&#13;
billion), and the remainder was in the form of 20-35 year loans carrying an interest of between I and 2%.&#13;
The only exception were the loans from the African Development Bank which was for a period of 15&#13;
years and carried an interest rate of 8%. The debt service in 1996 was about FCFA 14 billion per year&#13;
(i.e. about US$ 28 million).&#13;
6.4    OMVS budget for the period 1994-1996 is shown in Table 6.2. In 1996, the total budget of&#13;
OMVS was of FCFA 1.6 billion.&#13;

6.5    More than two-thirds of OMVS budget is financed by the three States. Operational costs are&#13;
shared equally, while investment costs are divided on the basis of determined shares (cle generale de&#13;
repartition) which are periodically revised (currently: Mali 35.3%, Mauritania 22.6% and Senegal&#13;
42.1%).&#13;
6.6    There are serious problems with the way OMVS is currently structured, staffed and financed. It&#13;
has little autonomy, and less than a quarter of the staff are listed as professional, generally consisting of&#13;
civil servants from each of the three countries. Its budget is financed by contributions from each of the&#13;
three Member States and from donors, as well as by water-user fees. None of these sources of funding&#13;
are predictable and arrears are common. For example in 1991, revenues from water-users fees was&#13;
projected at 172 million FCFA, but actual receipts amounted to only 16 million FCFA. Moreover, about&#13;
55% of the expenditures are on personnel and not enough is spent on maintenance of the dam and other&#13;
structures. Approval and payment procedures are cumbersome for the departments in charge of dam&#13;
maintenance (particularly for unscheduled maintenance), which budget is chiefly affected by recurrent&#13;
cash flow difficulties of the organization. As currently structured, OMVS is not a financially autonomous&#13;
organization and it has a budgetary type of accounting system.&#13;
6.7    As a condition for proceeding with the proposed project, a major change in the institutional and&#13;
organizational setup has been agreed to with OMVS and the three countries. The major objectives of the&#13;
new institutional framework was (a) to clearly define responsibilities, separating the regulatory and&#13;
management functions; (b) to provide financial and managerial autonomy of the entity charged of project&#13;
construction; and (c) to allow for efficient operation and management of the facilities already built and to&#13;
be built under the proposed project Under the new arrangements, the following was agreed:&#13;
(a) that the Member-States (Mali, Mauritania, and Senegal), would keep ownership of project assets and&#13;
facilities and be responsible for debt service on the Manantali and Diama dams;&#13;
(b) that the High Commission of OMVS (Haut-Commissariat) would be restructured and its&#13;
responsibilities limited to coordination, regulation and policy matters relating to water management,&#13;
environment and health impact mitigation and monitoring, etc.;&#13;
(c) that a new asset holding company, the Societe de Gestion de l'Energie de Manantali (SOGEM),&#13;
would be created which will be delegated the right to use the power facilities and be responsible for&#13;
the renewal of the hydropower generation facilities as well as transmission lines;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
(d) that a private, professional company, the Societe d'Exploitation de Manantali (SEM), would be&#13;
recruited and be responsible for operating and managing the power facilities, under a 15-year&#13;
concession contract, renewable at the end of the period; and&#13;
(e) that a separate agency be created, under OMVS supervision, to be responsible for managing and&#13;
operating the Diama dam and related water supply facilities.&#13;
6.8   In the future, the Member-States will continue to remain undivided owners of the dams, the dikes&#13;
and facilities to be built under the proposed project. The Governments will also give in concession to&#13;
SOGEM the Manantali dam and related equipment. However, SOGEM will be responsible for only&#13;
43.8% of the debt service incurred in the construction of the Manantali damn, with the other 56.2%&#13;
attributed to other activities including irrigation and navigation. Energy generated at Manantali will&#13;
begin to be dispatched to the three national power utilities (EDM, SONELEC and SENELEC) following&#13;
the share in the project which is as follows: Mali 52%, Mauritania 15%, and Senegal 33%. However,&#13;
actual repartition and dispatching will vary on a daily basis depending on the demand and costs of each&#13;
utility.&#13;
6.9    Financial arrangements. SOGEM will be responsible for the renewal of major equipment, and&#13;
will make appropriate provisions for this. In its agreement with the private operator (SEM), SOGEM&#13;
will require SEM not only to operate and maintain the power facilities and the dam, according to&#13;
specified performance indicators, but also to carry out and finance all repairs and replacement of&#13;
equipment within the timeframe of its contract. Within this framework, the financial flows would be as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(a) SEM will bill the national utilities in accordance with the energy sold to each utility and&#13;
agreed upon tariffs;&#13;
(b) SEM passes on the revenues to SOGEM, minus its fees and any other contractual expense;&#13;
(c) with revenues received, SOGEM will:&#13;
(i) service the project debt on behalf of the Member-States and for the loans it contracts&#13;
directly;&#13;
(ii) pay its operating expenses;&#13;
(iii)constitute adequate provisions for addressing hydrology-related financial risks and for&#13;
renewal of major equipment;&#13;
(iv) pay a fee to the Member-States (as per tariff agreement) to reimburse part of the&#13;
advances made by the States for dam construction and project expenses;&#13;
(d) any funds remaining over and above those used by SEM and SOGEM will be shared equally&#13;
by the three States; and&#13;
(e) The States will continue to finance directly the operations of OMVS.&#13;
B.    SOGEM's Financial Analysis&#13;
6.10   Power tariffs to be charged under the project have already been agreed to and are based on&#13;
numerous studies and the result of difficult negotiations. The main objectives of the tariff structure are:&#13;
(a) to achieve SOGEM's financial equilibrium, after debt service and the cost of SEM's contract for&#13;
operation and maintenance; (b) to ensure that the tariff level will be acceptable to the three utilities; and&#13;
(c) to guarantee sufficient revenues to the Member States, reimbursing them for part of past investments&#13;
and advances.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
6.11   The financial equilibrium of SOGEM will be affected by three main factors: (a) the average&#13;
level of tariff, (b) the level past and future debt service on the dam borne by SOGEM (total annuities of&#13;
FCFA 89 billion paid from 1982 to 1996; and remaining capital of FCFA 124 billion at the beginning of&#13;
1997), and (c) the level of energy output from Manantali, which is dependent on hydrological factors.&#13;
Two scenarios were initially developed to evaluate the relative impact of these factors on SOGEM's&#13;
equilibrium (the detailed description of these scenarios has been placed in Project Files).&#13;
6.12   The base case scenario (Scenario A) uses the 1950-1994 hydrological series (average energy&#13;
output of 804 GWh per year), and only assumes the part of the debt service (future annuities) that OMVS&#13;
has allocated on an economic basis to the power component of the dam (43.8% of the total cost of the&#13;
dam), and also the reimbursement of past annuities (payments made by the three Member States from&#13;
1982 to 2001).&#13;
6.13   The second scenario (Scenario B) uses the same hydrological series, but assumes all of the debt&#13;
(100%) related to the dam. Under these assumptions, SOGEM would bear the complete future debt&#13;
service (FCFA 123.9 billion) as well as the global reimbursement of past annuities (FCFA 75.4 billion by&#13;
the end of 1996). Based on the results of simulations and on the potential impact of scenario B on the&#13;
tariff of the Manantali energy, OMVS has decided not to seek additional revenues from the project&#13;
beyond the share already allocated to the energy on an economic basis (43.8%) and allow irrigation&#13;
development and other users to bear the rest of the debt burden. Although this implies an unusual&#13;
accounting treatment in SOGEM's balance sheet of the assets constituted by the dam and associated&#13;
equipment, it is an acceptable solution. Scenario A is thus used in the financial analysis of SOGEM.&#13;
6.14   The impact of low hydrology occurrence on the equilibrium tariff was also assessed for the base&#13;
case (scenario A) in the following situations: (i) average energy output reduced to 565 GWh, based on&#13;
the 1970-1994 series (scenario C); (ii) occurrence of driest years from the start of operations in 2001&#13;
(based on the 1978-1991 series with an average of 450 GWh and average output of 600 GWh thereafter,&#13;
scenario D).&#13;
6.15. SOGEM's opening balance sheet: The following table summarizes the opening balance sheet of&#13;
SOGEM, as of January 1, 1997.&#13;

6.16   For the purposes of the balance sheet, only 43.8 % of the cost of the dam is included as&#13;
SOGEM's fixed assets. The present value of the dam is calculated after deduction of depreciation and&#13;
includes a reevaluation of the foreign exchange costs (80 %) of this asset to take into account the 1994&#13;
devaluation of the CFA Franc (50 % compared with FRF).&#13;
6.17   Although part of debt service on the loans contracted by Governments for Manantali dam&#13;
construction must be covered by energy sales, it is assumed that these loans will not be onlent to&#13;
SOGEM: in the future, the corresponding debt service will still be paid directly by the Member States,&#13;
as was done from 1982 to 1996. The three Governments will receive specific revenues from SOGEM&#13;
(redevance), as soon as SOGEM begins to sell energy. No counterpart for this disposition appears in&#13;
SOGEM's liabilities.&#13;
6.18   However, the 1982 to 1996 annuities, paid by the Member States, will be repaid by SOGEM.&#13;
Consequently, the total amount of these past annuities will appear as long term debt towards the Member&#13;
States in SOGEM's opening balance sheet. As a result, SOGEM only bears the part of the dam attributed&#13;
to power component, and the long term debt is limited to 43.8% of 1982 to 1996 annuities, which is&#13;
CFAF 33.0 billion. The level of equity in the liability structure of SOGEM results from the above&#13;
assumptions.&#13;
6.19   Financing plan: The financing requirements for the proposed project, staggered over the period&#13;
1997 - 2001, total CFAF 223 billion, or US$ 442 million equivalent. The Governments' contribution of&#13;
(CFAF 18.7 billion, including interest during construction) will amount to about 8.5% of total financing.&#13;
A pool of 12 donors will fund the remaining CFAF 205 billion. About two-thirds of the financing (CFAF&#13;
136 billion) will consist of direct loans to SOGEM or loans to the three Member States, who will later&#13;
onlend them  to SOGEM  on commercial terms.  The remaining one-third would be grants&#13;
(CFAF 67.3 billion), which will be treated as equity.&#13;

6.21    As SOGEM will begin to operate the facilities (together with SEM) only by the end of 2000, the&#13;
company will not be in a position to self-finance its activities, nor assume the payment of interests or&#13;
redevance, during the construction period. The operation, technical assistance and equipment budget of&#13;
SOGEM is included in the financing plan of the whole project, as well as interest during construction.&#13;
The former is taken into account as  intangible assets; the latter is added to real investments costs.&#13;
Similarly, SOGEM will not pay the redevance to the Member States between 1997 and 2000, but the&#13;
corresponding annuities of the debt service on the dam will be reflected in its long term liabilities.&#13;
Consequently, equity will be reduced each year by the amount of these transfers.&#13;

6.23   From 1997, the new facilities to be constructed under the project are reflected in SOGEM's&#13;
balance sheet as part of fixed assets. Similarly new loans are registered in SOGEM's balance sheet as&#13;
long term liabilities. The financing that will be funded in the form of grants is considered as equity. Debt&#13;
to the Member States (for the dam) amounts to about CFAF 47.4 billion in 2001, which means a&#13;
CFAF 14.7 billion increase compared to 1997. Together with the new loans contracted or onlent to&#13;
SOGEM by the Member States, the long term debt amounts to CFAF 184.6 billion in 2001 (equivalent to&#13;
US$ 352 million). SOGEM's equity amounts to CFAF 113.5 billion (US$ 216 million). The debt equity&#13;
ratio would rise from 0.6 in 1997 to an acceptable 1.6 in 2001.&#13;

6.26   The average cost of energy stays constant around 30.5 CFAF per kWh from 2002 to 2005. Then,&#13;
it shows a decrease to 25.6 CFA in 2006, and remains between 23 and 25 CFAF per kWh until 2030. The&#13;
sudden step down between 2005 and 2006 is due to the end of the depreciation of SOGEM's incorporeal&#13;
assets (budget, strengthening and equipment of SOGEM during the construction period, as well as&#13;
training), which is taken into account on a 5-year period, from 2001 to 2005. As those investments will&#13;
be financed by the three Member States through grant money, accounting practices should allow a&#13;
symmetrical reintegration of the grants into SOGEM's income statements. With such adjustments, the&#13;
2002 to 2005 surcharge would disappear and consequently, the average costs would be around 26 CFAF&#13;
per kWh.&#13;

6.28   It is assumed that repayments for the loans contracted for the proposed Manantali project will&#13;
begin in 2002, but the highest annuity will be reached only in 2007. Thus, the projections pay a particular&#13;
attention to that specific year. Until 2005, repayments remain modest, so the equilibrium cost of energy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
45&#13;
(defined as the price that will balance applications and sources of funds) stays rather low, between 20.2&#13;
and 22.5 CFAF per kWh in scenario A. Then, the rise in the debt service annuities leads to a 20%&#13;
increase in the equilibrium cost which will reach 26.8 CFAF per kWh in 2007. It will then slowly&#13;
decrease after 2007.&#13;
6.29   Scenario C shows that the impact of dry years may be serious on SOGEM's financial&#13;
equilibrium. If the average output of Manantali is 565 GWh (as in the 70-94 series), instead of 800 GWh&#13;
(50-94 series), the equilibrium cost will be about 42 % higher. In 2007, it would reach&#13;
38.0 CFAF per kWh.&#13;
6.30   Defining the adequate average tariff. The following chart shows the evolution of the average&#13;
cost and the equilibrium cost from 2001 to 2030, for scenario A.&#13;

6.31   As shown by the above chart, the price of energy produced in Manantali should be determined in&#13;
respect with both economic (equilibrium of income statements) and financial (equilibrium of funds flow&#13;
statements) constraints. From 2002 to 2005, the economic constraint is the strongest; from 2006 to 2015,&#13;
the average cost gets lower and, due to the rise in debt service, the financial constraint becomes more&#13;
important. Finally, after 2015, the equilibrium cost would fall to under the average cost, but the&#13;
financing of renewal of some facilities may limit this decrease.&#13;
6.32   The tariff structure is not based on the economic cost during the 2001 - 2005 period, because:&#13;
* the high level of the economic cost between 2001 and 2005 is mostly due to the rapid rate of&#13;
depreciation of SOGEM's intangible assets, which could be compensated through an equivalent&#13;
reintegration of the grants received by SOGEM to fund these particular expenses during the&#13;
construction period;&#13;
*  a sharp decrease would have to be implemented in 2006 and 2007: a smoother evolution of tariff&#13;
must be found.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46&#13;
6.33    The evolution of the average tariff should be such as to:&#13;
*   always meet the financial constraint; and&#13;
*   meet the economic cost in the medium- to long-term (to ensure the necessary renewal of assets).&#13;
6.34    This can be achieved through the tariff level shown on the chart:&#13;
*   the price of energy would be raised each year like inflation, which means stability in real terms,&#13;
*  the level of tariff would be calculated to satisfy the financial constraint in the most difficult year&#13;
(2007), in each scenario,&#13;
*   the tariff could be kept constant in current CFAF after 2007.&#13;
6.35    Tariffs under the 2 scenarios are presented below: based on debt and other costs, and assuming&#13;
the average gross energy output of Manantali to be 800 GWh a year, the level of tariff will have to be&#13;
20.8 FCFA1997/kWh (scenario A). In real terms, the tariff will be 23.0 CFAF per kWh in 2001, and&#13;
26.8 CFAF in 2007. If the average energy output decreases to 565 GWh a year, then the tariff will have&#13;
to go up to 29.4 FCFA,997/kWh (scenario C), in order to meet the same financial requirements as in the&#13;
base case scenario (scenario A).&#13;

6.36    In Scenario A, the cost of energy produced in Manantali for the three utilities, even after&#13;
deduction of transmission losses (which vary according to the energy actually transmitted), seems very&#13;
reasonable compared to thermal alternatives. In scenario C, in order to compensate low energy outputs,&#13;
tariffs could be lowered by postponing the reimbursement of the already occurred annuities of the debt&#13;
service on the dam, so as to permit a lower level of tariff in 2001 (about 3 CFAF less for a total&#13;
postponement). Compared to present generation costs by the three national utilities with their existing&#13;
thermal facilities, the resulting level of tariff for energy produced in Manantali is still attractive for the&#13;
three utilities.&#13;
6.37    Tariff mechanisms are built on the principle of a binomial formula, with a fixed component and a&#13;
proportional price. The fixed component will be totally payable whatever the annual output, whereas the&#13;
other part will be owed only for actual energy purchases. Both components will be calculated in the&#13;
following way:&#13;
* total revenues from energy sales must equal SOGEM's incompressible applications in dry years&#13;
when the energy output would be as low as 600 GWh,&#13;
* total revenues must also cover all other applications, including sufficient endowment of the&#13;
hydrology fund, in an average hydrology year,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47&#13;
during the driest years (energy output of less than 600 GWh), as simulated in scenario D, the&#13;
resources of the hydrology fund will be used thus limiting the increase of the tariff to a maximum&#13;
of about CFAF40/kWh in current terms, during the first years of project operations which are the&#13;
most financially constrained.&#13;
6.38   Sharing agreements will be signed between the utilities and SOGEM. These contracts will&#13;
specify each utility's share of Manantali energy. They will also describe the technical and financial&#13;
conditions under which a utility may sell part of its allocated energy to another utility, or how they could&#13;
exchange thernal energy through SOGEM's transmission system.&#13;
6.39   A detailed Tariff Agreement, including SOGEM's financial projections, the tariff formula, an&#13;
interconnection agreement and a draft Power Purchase Agreement between the SNEs and the private&#13;
operator was agreed upon during credit negotiations (para 8.1), and is expected to be signed shortly.&#13;
The tariff agrrement has been placed in the Project Files.&#13;
6.40   Addressing the main financial risks. The main financial risks borne by the project result&#13;
from: (a) the evolution of the revenues required from SOGEM; (b) the uncertainty of Manantali energy&#13;
output, resulting from hydrology; (c) the currency convertibility risk ; and (d) the risk of non-payment of&#13;
electricity bills by the national power utilities.&#13;
6.41   Flexibility of revenues. In Scenario A, SOGEM can easily honor both the debt service of the&#13;
proposed project as well as the part of the debt service on the dam that refers to the energy component.&#13;
The redevance (which represents the debt service on the dam) decreases throughout the period, as well as&#13;
the debt service of the proposed project after 2007. Furthermore, the amount of SOGEM's total&#13;
applications varies significantly from one specific year to another, as a result of the normal evolution of&#13;
the debt service on the many different loans involved in the project. Thus, at the beginning of project&#13;
operations, it will be necessary to postpone in part the provision of the renewal fund and the payment of&#13;
the dam debt service, so as to allow a smoother evolution of the average level of tariff.  The&#13;
reimbursement of the Member States advances (the part of 1982 to 2001 annuities of the debt service on&#13;
the dam, that will be transferred to SOGEM), as well as the redevance if necessary, would be partially or&#13;
completely postponed in case of low energy output.&#13;
6.42   Allocating hydrology risk. As the annual output of Manantali may vary significantly with&#13;
hydrological parameters, there is a need for regulation mechanisms to reduce the impact of the hydrology&#13;
risk and to optimize the allocation of the remaining part of the risk. Indeed, a stable tariff level, whatever&#13;
the output, would lead in bad hydrology years to sharp cash shortfalls for SOGEM, whereas giving the&#13;
priority to SOGEM cash flows will result in an erratic evolution of the tariff level. In order to avoid&#13;
either problems, the hydrology risk can be greatly reduced by creating a special hydrology fund, which&#13;
would be provisioned during the best years and used as complementary resource in the driest years. The&#13;
provisions for fund is considered as a priority as soon as operations begin. In fact, as debt service on the&#13;
project remains at a low level until 2005, an acceptable level of tariff will generate cash surpluses that&#13;
could be easily transferred to the hydrology fund.&#13;
6.43   But the proposed fund will not fully address the hydrology risk. Therefore, it is necessary to&#13;
envisage allocating the remaining risk between the project participants. It seems difficult to allocate the&#13;
risks to the private operator (SEM), which will be mostly concerned with operations and maintenance&#13;
expenditures for which there is no possible postponement. Secondly, SOGEM can only bear the risk&#13;
through the hydrology fund. Consequently, the remaining risk can only be borne by the national utilities&#13;
and the Member States. The forner would assume part of the risk through a tariff formula that allows&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48&#13;
for increases if hydrology is insufficient. The members States will have to bear the remaining part&#13;
through the variable rate of payment of both redevance and past debt service on the dam.&#13;
6.44   Currency convertibility and exchange rate risk. During credit negotiations, it was agreed&#13;
that the exchange rate risk will be borne by SOGEM (para 8.1). The company assumes the debt service,&#13;
and most loans are contracted in hard currencies. Though operation and maintenance costs are SEM's&#13;
responsibility, the management contract should include a revision formula based on SEM real costs&#13;
structure, which will finally transfer the risk to SOGEM. However, a significant and durable depreciation&#13;
of the CFAF is not likely, as inflation is already low in all three countries. Moreover, if this depreciation&#13;
should occur, it would be perceptible on thermal generation costs as well, and an eventual adjustment of&#13;
the tariff level would not compromise the sale of Manantali energy. Currency convertibility issues are&#13;
only related to payments to be made to SEM in Ougiyas, which however would concern a very limited&#13;
part of sales (less than 10%) and would be repaid in part by SOGEM to the government of Mauritania for&#13;
debt service. During credit negotiations, it was agreed that payment of electricity purchased by the&#13;
utilities will be made in the currency of their respective country, with satisfactory dispositions to be&#13;
established concerning the conversion of Ougiyas and the bearing of corresponding transaction costs by&#13;
SOGEM (para 8. 1).&#13;
6.45   Mitigating the risk of non-payment. Because of the chronically weak financial situation of all&#13;
three utilities, it is necessary to address the risk of non-payment of Manantali's electricity bills. Even&#13;
though sector reforms have recently been implemented or are planned during the period of construction,&#13;
the risk that one (or more) utility would face sharp cash shortfalls cannot be ruled out. The following&#13;
options have been reviewed and are to be considered in the final dispositions that will be implemented&#13;
before the start of project operations (2001):&#13;
*  offsetting by SOGEM of its debt service to the respective governments against unpaid bills: such&#13;
a disposition tends to involve government into the management of the sector, which is precisely&#13;
contrary to the general objectives of the project. This option would be used only if the utility&#13;
faces difficulties due to unpaid public sector bills.&#13;
*  ensuring that national budgets reflect adequate provisions for Government electricity/water&#13;
consumption bills.&#13;
*  paying directly part of Government bills for electricity/water consumption into an escrow account&#13;
managed by SOGEM, rather than to the utility itself, if the utility accumulates unpaid bills&#13;
towards SEM.&#13;
*  direct billing and collection by SEM with large industrial customers of the three utilities: this&#13;
option would necessitate an adaptation of the national power institutional and legal framework to&#13;
address the problem of distribution monopoly of the utilities.&#13;
6.46   It must be noted, however, that the average price of Manantali energy will be attractive to the&#13;
utilities in comparison with other generation alternatives, which will strongly mitigate the non-payment&#13;
risk. In case of non-payment, as included in the provisions of the concession contract, SEM would&#13;
interrupt or reduce energy supply to non-paying utilities, and/or sell the corresponding surplus to another&#13;
utility.&#13;
6.47   The principles and procedures for establishing special funds and the corresponding bank&#13;
accounts, to be opened by SOGEM, in order to constitute adequate provisions (starting in 2001) for&#13;
hydrology risk and plant renewal and for project debt service were agreed upon during credit&#13;
negotiations (para 8.1). A special account (compte domiciliataire) for payment of debt service could be&#13;
directly provisioned by SEM from the proceeds of energy sales.&#13;

6.49    SOGEM's revenues increase until 2007, as tariffs are adjusted to reflect inflation and then&#13;
remain constant. The operating income stays between 10 and 13 billion CFAF throughout the period,&#13;
except in 2001 because the project is not fully operational. From 2001 to 2005, the net income remains&#13;
negative mostly because of the fast rate of depreciation of incorporeal investments (SOGEM's budget&#13;
during construction and training expenditures). If the subsidies received to finance these investments&#13;
were reintegrated into SOGEM's income statement (CFAF 3,5 billion per year during the 5 years), the&#13;
net income would be nearly balanced as early as 2004. From 2006 onwards, the net income rises steadily&#13;
from 2% of revenues in 2006 to 12 % in 2010 and reaches 14 % in 2015.&#13;
6.50    Due to the increasing debt service, the net internal cash generated shows an erratic evolution&#13;
until 2010, but is satisfactory. The rate base does not decrease much at the end of the period because&#13;
provisions for asset renewal are considered. The rate of return on rate base remains between 0 and 1%,&#13;
which is consistent with SOGEM's break-even financial objective (and project covenant), as part of the&#13;
Tariff Agreement. The debt service coverage ratio performs well and falls to a low of just 1.0 from&#13;
2006 to 2008 when the debt service is at its highest point. Finally, the debt equity ratio indicates the&#13;
constant strengthening of SOGEM's equity.&#13;

C.    SEM's Future Financial Performance.&#13;
6.51   The project operations will start in October 2000, with the reception of the first generating unit&#13;
group. As the SEM  will operate under a contract including all necessary rules of revision of its&#13;
remuneration, it is assumed in the projections below that this remuneration will increase, in current&#13;
terms, with the inflation rate.&#13;

7. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
A.       Project Justification&#13;
7.1   The electricity supply systems of the three OMVS states are predominantly thermal; only Mali&#13;
has about 50 MW of hydro generation capacity, while the other two countries have none. Mali also&#13;
suffers from the handicap of its landlocked location and the poor transport infrastructure to bring fuel&#13;
from the Atlantic ports of its neighboring countries, which adds over US$100/ton to the cost of fuel. All&#13;
three power systems are small in size, with a total combined installed capacity of less than 400 MW and&#13;
do not benefit from economies of scale in power generation. Hence electricity is a high-cost product in&#13;
the three countries, even at current (low) world oil prices.&#13;
7.2    Yet the regulation of the Senegal River in the 1980s, by the construction of two dams, Diama&#13;
near the mouth of the river, and Manantali, about 1,200 km upstream, has given rise to an opportunity to&#13;
tap the river's hydroelectric potential. The creation of a reservoir at Manantali with a storage capacity of&#13;
11.3 billion cu. m offers the potential of generating 200 MW of power, equivalent to about half of the&#13;
present combined generating capacity in the three OMVS countries. In economic terms, the existence of&#13;
the dam and reservoir are unused physical assets which give a hydroelectric generation project an&#13;
overwhelming advantage over any thermal alternative.&#13;
7.3    However, Manantali is in a remote location far from the main electricity markets of Dakar (1,100&#13;
km) and Bamako (300 km), and its development for power requires lengthy transmission lines in&#13;
addition to the power plant. Sluggish economic growth over the 1980s, with a consequent impact on&#13;
power demand, falling real oil prices and difficulties in reaching agreement on the scope and phasing of&#13;
the energy project all contributed to the delay in proceeding with it.&#13;
B.        Demand Forecast&#13;
7.4    Demand for electricity is growing in all three countries, but at differing rates. Over the past five&#13;
years, it has increased at an annual average rate of 7.2% in Mali, 7.8% in Mauritania, and 5.1% in&#13;
Senegal. Details of the demand forecasts are contained in Annex 1 (Table 1.3). These are considered to&#13;
be realistic in the light of historical trends and projected GDP growth. Mali already suffers from acute&#13;
power shortages in the dry season and urgently requires new generation capacity. Load shedding&#13;
amounting to almost 50% of peak demand took place during the two months preceding the 1996 rainy&#13;
season. Due to the delay in proceeding with the proposed project, Mali is investing in about 20 MW of&#13;
high-cost, new thermal plant to meet dry season demand during the Manantali construction period.&#13;
Existing capacity is sufficient to meet peak demand in the other two states (Senegal and Mauritania) till&#13;
the end of the decade, but they too will face shortages if new plants are not brought on stream within the&#13;
next five years. However, much of the hydro output from Manantali will meet base-load demand,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
52&#13;
enabling a significant reduction in the use of high-cost thermal plants. This renders the proposed project&#13;
largely immune from fluctuations in the level of total demand.&#13;
C.        Least-cost analysis for system expansion&#13;
7.5    The alternative supply solution for each country would have been to proceed independently with&#13;
increments to their thermal plants. Integrated system planning studies have demonstrated that the least-&#13;
cost solution is to develop Manantali to meet their combined power needs as estimated by the load&#13;
forecasts for the three states. OMVS' consultants compared an all-thermal, system expansion scenario&#13;
with a mixed hydro/thermal scenario in which the three power systems would be interconnected. Details&#13;
are given in Annex 9. The equalizing discount rate was about 22%, demonstrating the significant cost&#13;
savings arising from the development of Manantali. These savings arise from (a) deferral of thermal&#13;
investments, (b) economies in fuel consumption and maintenance costs, and (c) opportunities for&#13;
exchanges of power between the three utilities to minimize overall system costs, by maximizing use of&#13;
the lowest cost generation plant, regardless of its location.&#13;
D.        Benefits&#13;
7.6    The main project benefits consist of the production of electricity, which has been estimated at an&#13;
annual average of 804 GWh, based on 1950-94 hydrological data. Given the high variability in rainfall,&#13;
the annual output from the project is subject to a considerable degree of uncertainty. The use of a shorter&#13;
hydrological time series (1970-94), has a very significant impact on the estimated energy output from&#13;
Manantali, which drops to 547 GWh, because of the succession of very dry years in the late 1970s/early&#13;
1980s. The base case economic analysis of the project has been based on the average output of the 1950-&#13;
94 hydrological series, but this has been subjected to a full risk analysis (Annex 9), in the light of the&#13;
high variability of rainfall.&#13;
7.7    The average net electricity output of the project has been conservatively valued at the current&#13;
weighted average high voltage tariff of the three companies (CFAF 63/US$0.12 per kWh). This is&#13;
considered to be the minimum economic value of the plant output. Present, low voltage tariffs are&#13;
significantly higher (CFAF 82/US$0.16 per kWh), and consumer willingness-to-pay for reliable power&#13;
supply is deemed to be significantly higher than the value used to estimate the benefits of the project.&#13;
7.8    Simulations carried out by OMVS' consultants show that the transmission lines to be built to&#13;
bring power from Manantali to the three capital cities will also be used to reverse the direction of power&#13;
flows when justified by fuel savings. For example, the heavy fuel oil units in Nouakchott produce&#13;
electricity at a lower cost than some of the units in Dakar and thus power from Nouakchott would flow to&#13;
Senegal at certain times. Similarly, there are expected to be periods when power would flow eastwards&#13;
from Dakar to Mali. The interconnection will thus allow system-wide fuel savings by optimizing the use&#13;
of generation plant. Such benefits have not been included in the estimate of the project's internal rate of&#13;
return.&#13;
E.    Allocation of water between irrigation, artificial flooding and energy&#13;
7.9    Both of the estimates of energy output from Manantali (para 7.6) take into account the&#13;
requirement to release sufficient water from the reservoir to produce an artificial flood of about 5.5&#13;
billion m3 in all but driest years. A flood of this size would permit the cultivation of sorghum on at least&#13;
50,000 ha. of flood plain by traditional methods, as well as a number of environment benefits which are&#13;
outlined in Annex 10. However, such a support to the natural flood is not possible during the driest years&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
53&#13;
(I out of 7 in average). Under the 1950-94 hydrological series, the average energy output from&#13;
Manantali would be about 7% higher without the constraint to provide an artificial flood, but there would&#13;
then be an unacceptable reduction in the frequency of occurrence of the flood. The proposed reservoir&#13;
management strategy is thus a compromise that strikes a good balance between these competing uses for&#13;
the water. Providing a larger flood than 5.5 billion cu. m would further reduce the electricity output&#13;
while only marginally increasing the area actually cultivated. On the other hand, reducing or eliminating&#13;
the flood entirely to maximize electricity output would be too costly for a multitude of economic, social,&#13;
political and environmental reasons, as explained in Annex IO.&#13;
7.10   The agreed reservoir management strategy for the proposed project is thus a compromise&#13;
between energy and flood-recession agriculture. At present, the water requirements for pumped&#13;
irrigation are not a constraint for energy production. An artificial flood can also be produced in years of&#13;
average rainfall while still holding back sufficient water in the reservoir to meet irrigation needs and&#13;
generate about 800 GWh of electricity. As the area of irrigated land increases, the higher dry season&#13;
flow needed for agriculture can still be passed through the turbines to first generate power. Nevertheless,&#13;
there is a risk that in the long term, once the area under irrigation largely exceeds 100,000 ha., the release&#13;
of water for an artificial flood may come into conflict with both irrigation and power in dry years.&#13;
However, this may take another 20 years as the current pace of development is only about 2000 ha. per&#13;
year in gross terms. In addition, improved returns to irrigated agriculture would help to reduce&#13;
dependence on flood-recession cultivation and thus diminish the need for an artificial flood. In the past,&#13;
prior to the construction of the dams, rural populations were adapted to the risk of occasional dry years&#13;
when no flood-recession cultivation was possible. The construction of the dans allows improved timing&#13;
of flood water releases and interannual water storage, thereby enabling more frequent 'artificial' floods&#13;
than would occur if the river had remained unregulated. However, in the driest years it would be&#13;
impossible to create a flood because releases from Manantali only represent about half the flows needed&#13;
for the Senegal to overflow its banks.&#13;
F.        Economic Rate of Return&#13;
7.11   The base case internal rate of return (IRR) on the project was estimated to be 16%. Details of&#13;
the calculations are contained in Annex 9. The investment already made in the dam was excluded from&#13;
the analysis. However, the loss in agricultural output arising from a reduction in the average area of&#13;
flood-recession cultivation was considered as a cost and included in the analysis. Additional benefits to&#13;
the energy sector from interconnection, such as fuel savings from bilateral energy trading were excluded.&#13;
G.        Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
7.12   The IRR falls to 11% if the annual average gross energy output over the 1970-94 period is used&#13;
(547 GWh). The impact of a 10% cost over-run is to lower the base-case IRR to 14%. However the&#13;
risks of such an overrun are low, as bids have already been received for project components that account&#13;
for about half of project costs. The effect of a one-year delay in completing the project is a reduction in&#13;
the base case IRR to 15%. The risk of such an occurrence is considered low because the construction of&#13;
a transmission line over flat terrain does not present any particular technical difficulties and the process&#13;
of land and rights-of-way acquisition has already begun.&#13;
7.13   The IRR is not sensitive to changes in the final demand for electricity because the plant would&#13;
mainly serve for base load, thereby allowing the national power companies to reduce the operations of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54&#13;
higher-cost thermal plant. The impact of lower than expected demand growth would therefore only be&#13;
felt in the utilization rate of thermal plant.&#13;
H.        Probabilistic risk analysis&#13;
7.14   A risk analysis was carried out to assess the impact on the project's IRR of the uncertainty in key&#13;
variables, particularly hydrology and energy output, project costs, construction time and the loss of&#13;
traditional agricultural output from reduced flood-plain cultivation. A spreadsheet based software&#13;
(Crystal Ball) was used to that effect. The risk analysis showed that the base case IRR varies from&#13;
11.6% to 17.2% with an 90% probability of being more than 13.1%. In the low-hydrology variant, the&#13;
IRR ranges between 6.3% and 12.4% and has a 90% probability of being above 8.2%. Details are&#13;
contained in Annex 9.&#13;
I.        Other Risks&#13;
7.15   In addition to the quantified economic risks used to test the robustness of the IRR estimate, the&#13;
project also faces financial and commercial risks which are more difficult to evaluate quantitatively.&#13;
(paras 6.40 to 6.50) They are summarized in Table 7.1, along with the proposed mitigation measures.&#13;

REGIONAL HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
PROJECT INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
Rationale for selected options&#13;
The project institutional framework aims at:&#13;
(a) identifying clearly the scope of the Project. It consists of the already built Manantali dam and&#13;
of the hydropower plant to be build (the hydropower station, the dispatching center, the lines&#13;
and the transformer stations). The irrigation facilities and the Diama dam, downstream&#13;
Manantali, are not in the scope of the project.&#13;
(b) providing the financial autonomy of the Project in order to cover the operating costs and&#13;
guarantee the debt service. It implies the constitution of a new company entrusted in&#13;
managing the facilities of the Project.&#13;
(c) obtaining an efficient operation of the facilities that will allow the best quality of service and&#13;
maximize the duration of the plants. This necessitates the involvement of a professional&#13;
private firm.&#13;
Entities and responsibilities&#13;
2.    The following entities are involved in the institutional framework of the project:&#13;
(a)    The Member-States: they are undivided owners of the works and are responsible for the&#13;
debt service of the works already built.&#13;
(b)    The Haut-Commissariat: as before, its role is to be a development agency for the River&#13;
Senegal. Regarding the Energy project, it will essentially work as a coordinator and a&#13;
regulation agent between the different customers.&#13;
(c)    An assets management company: the Societt de Gestion de 1 'Energie de Manantali,&#13;
named SOGEM. It will be granted of the right of use of the facilities of the Energy&#13;
project. It finances, realizes and takes possession of the works. It subcontracts the&#13;
operation to a professional private firm. It is in charge of the renewal of the hydropower&#13;
generation facilities as well as the lines and the part of the dam attributed to the Energy&#13;
project.&#13;
(d)    An operation company: the Societe d 'Exploitation de Manantali, named SEM. It runs the&#13;
Energy project facilities. It has the widest responsibility regarding operation and&#13;
maintenance (inclusive regular upkeep and (&lt; important repairs )&gt;), under 15 year&#13;
renewable operating contract and cahier des charges.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
65&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
(e)    A specific entity in charge of managing the irrigation facilities and operating the Diama&#13;
dam. It should be designed to provide a real autonomy to the water sector, and especially&#13;
it should get its revenues from the sale of water.&#13;
(f)    Coordination should be established between the entities in charge of the Energy project&#13;
and the one involved in the water project.&#13;
Financial flows&#13;
(a)    SEM  invoices the National Power utilities, in respect of the sales contracts. It is in&#13;
charge of collecting the bills.&#13;
(b)    The remuneration of SEM consists in an invariable part to cover operating costs, an&#13;
invariable part for regular maintenance, a variable part for maintenance linked to the&#13;
production level and a conditional part dependent on the achieving of specific objectives.&#13;
(c)    SEM pays to SOGEM  the difference between the billing of the National utilities and its&#13;
own remuneration. SOGEM can also raise loans (directly contracted or onlent by the&#13;
Member-States). With these revenues, SOGEM pays the debt service on directly&#13;
contracted loans, covers its operating costs and credits a special reserve dedicated to the&#13;
renewal of the facilities. The remaining amounts are given up to the Member-States.&#13;
(d)    The Member-States assure the debt service for the loans related to the existing facilities&#13;
and for the Energy project directly contracted new loans.&#13;
Recruitment of the professional private firm:&#13;
(a)    The recruitment will consist of three stages: (i) an open international consultation, (ii)&#13;
the constitution of a short-list of the candidates presenting sufficient technical references&#13;
in the field of hydropower works management and adequate financial references, and&#13;
(iii) a call for bids from prequalified firms.&#13;
(b)    The private company is due to be recruited in 2000.&#13;
Operating Contract&#13;
A detailed overview of the proposed operating contract between SOGEM and SEM, as well as technical&#13;
specifications for operations of the project facilities, has been placed in the Project Files.&#13;

REGIONAL HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
REFORM OF THE POWER SECTORS IN MALI, MAURITANIA AND SENEGAL&#13;
Action Plan - Mali&#13;
A. Long-term Institutional Framework of the Electricity Sector&#13;
Objectives and Justification&#13;
The objective is to set up a new institutional framework conducive to the rapid and sustainable&#13;
development of the power sector in Mali. The GOM has set up a steering committee (CEDISE) in charge&#13;
of: (a) organizing a wide consultation among all the stakeholders during 1997; (b) analyzing questions,&#13;
needs, and propositions raised during this first phase; and (c) proposing, during the first half of 1998,&#13;
decisions to be taken by the Government.&#13;
Duration&#13;
The total duration for this process is estimated at two years, starting with the nomination of the manager&#13;
of a small steering committee in charge of coordinating the process.&#13;
Organization and Management&#13;
The steering committee has the responsibility to investigate, organize debates and/or launch studies to&#13;
formulate a comprehensive strategic proposal for the development of the sector mainly from the&#13;
institutional, financial, and human resource perspectives.&#13;
This structure is managed by a leader with extensive experience within the sector, and who will have the&#13;
capacity to work with the current or potential stakeholders: managerial staff of the involved ministries&#13;
(Energy, Finance, Territorial Administration, etc.), and also communities, consumers, the banking sector,&#13;
operators involved in the electricity industry, autoproducers, trade unions, etc. This list is not exhaustive&#13;
and other people/resources should be consulted for specific contribution.&#13;
The Ministry of Mining, Energy and Hydraulics is in charge of the follow-up and the implementation of&#13;
the proposed options.&#13;
Implementation Schedule&#13;
March 1997 - November 1997&#13;
* Nomination of the steering committee;&#13;
* Consultation/debates with the current or potential stakeholders of the sector;&#13;
* Formulation of a report on the existing situation from the perspective of different actors and&#13;
identification of main topics to be analyzed for the long-term development of the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
68&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
September 1997 - February 1998&#13;
*  Implementation of working groups (sector specialists or not), in charge of preparing policy elements&#13;
for the different identified topics/issues/domains;&#13;
*  Organization of a five-day seminar where proposals for concrete actions to be submitted to the&#13;
authorities (Government, Economic, Social and Cultural Council, National Assembly, etc.) will be&#13;
collected. As a result, a "Draft Sector Policy Note" will be prepared.&#13;
March 1998 - June 1998:&#13;
*  Options discussed and decisions made by the authorities;&#13;
*  Preparation of draft legal and regulatory documents.&#13;
April 1998 - December 1998:&#13;
*  Adoption and enactment of the new institutional and regulatory framework.&#13;
B.    Restoring the financial viability of EDM&#13;
The following objectives were established by the Government immediately following credit negotiations,&#13;
in order to restore the financial viability of EDM in 1998: (i) deficit of less than CFAF 1 billion in 1997;&#13;
(ii) balanced operating statement in 1998 and beyond (without further Government support as of 1999);&#13;
and (iii) satisfactory cash flow position.&#13;
An action plan will be prepared by the Government before September 1997 to reach these objectives and&#13;
to take into account most recent data on EDM position/perspectives. The implementation of the action&#13;
plan will be monitored thereafter in the framework of this project and other IDA financed projects in the&#13;
power sector in Mali.&#13;
The Bank has indicated that a satisfactory cash flow position would imply that EDM: (i) maintains in&#13;
permanence its suppliers' credit to less than three months, as of January 1, 1998; (ii) is current with&#13;
payment of its debt service, as of January 1, 1998; (iii) maintains its cash flow situation to not less than 2&#13;
months of working capital needs, as of July 1, 1998. A satisfactory action plan will also be based on&#13;
adequate asset depreciation and provisions for asset renewal.&#13;

Action Plan - Senegal&#13;
1.    The power sector in Senegal faces many difficulties such as an insufficient access of populations&#13;
to electricity, both in urban and rural areas, a continuing deterioration of SENELEC's performances and&#13;
an insufficient competition in the petroleum sector. In 1996, in order to address this situation, the&#13;
Government of Senegal prepared a Letter of Sector Development Policy which was signed in February&#13;
1997. In this letter, the Government presents the decisions made regarding the evolution of the sector.&#13;
These decisions are fully in compliance with macroeconomic orientations discussed between the&#13;
Government of Senegal and the Bank, whose conclusions are contained in the country's Policy&#13;
Framework Paper.&#13;
2.    Regarding the power sector, the main decision was to privatize and restructure SENELEC in the&#13;
short run and to create the conditions for allowing competition. In order to reach these objectives a&#13;
profound modification of the legal and regulatory framework is necessary. The Government of Senegal&#13;
will recruit a specialized consulting firm to prepare this framework and to assist the Government in&#13;
preparing and conducting SENELEC privatization process. The following schedule has been adopted:&#13;
- Recruitment of the consulting firm to be completed before August 1, 1997;&#13;
* First draft on the future institutional framework (Power Sector Law) by November 15, 1997;&#13;
-  Proposition of the new Power Sector Law by November 30, 1997;&#13;
* Adoption of the new Law by December 31, 1997;&#13;
* Evaluation of SENELEC assets by February, 28 1998;&#13;
* Selection of a private strategic partner by June, 30 1998;&#13;
*  Transfer of the majority of SENELEC's shares to the strategic partner, the Senegalese private sector&#13;
and SENELEC's personnel, as well as transfer of full control of SENELEC's management and&#13;
operations to the strategic partner, by September 1998.&#13;
3.    In addition, the Government will take the necessary actions to initiate the audit of SENELEC's&#13;
1996 accounts before September 1, 1997, and to obtain a final audit report before December 31, 1997.&#13;

1.    The reform of the power/water and other public utilities has been discussed by the Government,&#13;
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in the framework of the preparation of the&#13;
Government's Policy Framework Plan (PFP)for 1997-1999.&#13;
Issues and actions&#13;
2.    The government recognizes the importance of the energy and water sectors for contributing to&#13;
economic and private sector development and intends to take actions to improve the coverage and quality&#13;
of services delivered, at affordable prices.&#13;
3.    To that effect, in the short term, the Government will take measures to restore the financial&#13;
health and viability of SONELEC and the transparency of its operations (including evaluation of assets;&#13;
cleaning of customer files and arrears; update of investment plan; timely payment of Government&#13;
consumption; tariff adjustment to allow full cost-recovery; revision of performance indicators; and&#13;
separation of accounts for water and electricity as well as for secondary urban sectors).&#13;
4.    The Government will also organize a high-level workshop to examine reform/restructuring&#13;
options and measures to increase the efficiency of public services (power, water and&#13;
telecommunications).&#13;
5     The Government will prepare Letters of Sector Development Policy to establish the strategy,&#13;
measures and timeframe of its program in the water and energy sectors.&#13;

REGIONAL HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Detailed Project Description&#13;
1.    The Regional Hydropower Project would develop an extensive power system which would reach&#13;
the urban areas of Mali, Mauritania and Senegal, fed with electric energy generated at a power station to&#13;
be established within the Project scope at the toe of the Manantali Dam. The Manantali Dam was&#13;
constructed in 1980s by OMVS across the Bafing River, a tributary of the Senegal River. Its reservoir&#13;
capacity is 11,300 million m3. The proposed power station would a have 200 MW installed capacity in&#13;
five 40 MW units. Average energy output is estimated at 804 GWh (based on hydrology data for the&#13;
period 1950-1994).&#13;
A. Investment Component&#13;

A-2. Transmission and Load Dispatching System&#13;
4.    The transmission system from Manantali would consist of an East System towards Bamako and a&#13;
West System towards Dakar. The general location of both systems is shown in Figure 1. attached, while&#13;
a single-line diagram appears in figure 2. The East System comprises a 306 Km long single-circuit 225&#13;
kW transmission line from Manantali to Kodialani (Bamako) with an en-route supply at Kita. A 150 kV&#13;
line 20 km long would be built between Kodialani and Sirakoro where the East System would&#13;
interconnect with Electricite du Mali (EDM) system. The West System comprises a 945 km long single-&#13;
circuit 225 kV transmission line from Manantali to Tobene. At Sakal it interconnects with the Dakar&#13;
system of SENELEC. The Sakal to Tobene 225 kV transmission line already exists. En route, supplies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 4&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
would be established at Kayes, Matam, Dagana and Sakal. From Dagana a 30 km long single-circuit 225&#13;
kV transmission line would feed at Rosso a 132 kV transmission link 195 km long with SONELEC's&#13;
system at Nouakchott. At Matam it would feed also into a 90 kV 86 km long transmission line to Kaedi.&#13;
A real-time load dispatch system would be implemented manage the power scheme operation. On the&#13;
East System it is proposed to install 2x75 MVA. 225/132 kV auto transformers at Kodialani and one 20&#13;

Kaedi:          One 10 MVA 90/15 kV.&#13;
(Transformers at Sakal and Tobene would be installed by SENELEC).  Concerning reactive&#13;
compensation the Project involves the installation of series capacitors and shunt reactances, as follows:&#13;
Series Capacitors on the 225 kV West System:&#13;
- One 30 ohms capacitor bank at Kayes on the Manantali line direction;&#13;
- Two 30 ohms capacitor banks at Matam on both the Kayes and the Dagana lines directions;&#13;
- Two 30 ohms capacitor banks at Dagana on both the Matam and the Sakal lines direction.&#13;
Shunt Reactors:&#13;
- Kodialani: One 25 MVAR reactor, at the 225 kV line arrival from Manantali;&#13;
- Manantali: Two 25 MVAR reactors connected to the 225 kV buss bars;&#13;
- Kayes, Matam and Dagana:&#13;
In each substation:&#13;
(i) One 25 MVAR reactor connected to east arrival of the 225 kV line;&#13;
(ii) One 20 MVAR reactor connected to the 225 kV buss bars; and Sakal and Tobene:&#13;
In each substation:&#13;
- One 20 MVAR reactor connected to the 225 kV buss bars. All shunt reactors would be connected&#13;
through 225 kV circuit breakers.&#13;
A-3 Supervision&#13;
5.    A consortium of three experienced consultants (Coyne &amp; Bellier/Fichtner/Tecsult) has been&#13;
recruited by OMVS to: (a) support bid evaluation and contract award for project components; (b)&#13;
supervise, on behalf of SOGEM, the construction of all project components and monitor contract&#13;
execution; (c) deliver the corresponding training for staff.&#13;

B. Institutional Strengthening&#13;
6.     The institutional strengthening component would include support to the two implementing&#13;
agencies, regarding the following:&#13;
0  assistance with the recruitment of a private operator for the management and operation of project&#13;
facilities (see draft terms of reference in Annex 6);&#13;
0  support to the implementation of the environmental mitigation and monitoring plan (Annex  11);&#13;
0  support to establishment/review  of tariff principles and mechanisms and energy purchase&#13;
agreements;&#13;
0  studies relating to the reservoir management optimization program, mitigating measures for&#13;
environment (health, traditional agriculture, etc.), promoting electrification of the Senegal valley and&#13;
development of new hydroelectric sites;&#13;
0  training of SOGEM and OMVS staff;&#13;
0  acquisition of related equipment and materials and vehicles; and&#13;
0  operation costs of SOGEM and OMVS during the construction of the project.&#13;
Technical Assessment&#13;
7.     A Technical Assessment of the project physical components (transmission lines and power&#13;
station), has been prepared and placed in the project files.&#13;
8.    Technical assessment of the dam. Inspections of the electromechanical equipment and civil&#13;
works of the dam were carried out in June/July 1996 by respectively Groupement&#13;
Manantali/Verbundplan and Groupement Manantali. Overall, the inspection reports show that the dam&#13;
is generally in fair condition and shows no signs of distress. However, seepage under the dam and uplift&#13;
in the pelite rock area should be addressed by careful grouting. The electromechanical equipment of the&#13;
dam is in fair condition, although the lack of spares and less than optimal maintenance should be&#13;
addressed urgently.&#13;

DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
RECRUITMENT OF THE PRIVATE OPERATOR&#13;
UNDER A CONCESSION CONTRACT&#13;
I.    INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND (To be completed)&#13;
Description of the new institutional framework, the various players, and their respective functions.&#13;
Justification for hiring a private operator: project sustainability, efficient operation (best service at&#13;
lowest cost), assumption of investments in maintenance and renewals during the period of the concession,&#13;
etc. Adequate incentives required. Objectives to be achieved. Risk sharing. Payment procedures.&#13;
Description of the principal technical characteristics of the project.&#13;
Mention of all of the studies and legal documents prepared within the project framework, and of the&#13;
results of the published announcement seeking expressions of interest from prospective bidders.&#13;
Purpose of the consultants' assignment: to assist the client (SOGEM and the technical committee,&#13;
see below) in the process of selection of a competitive private operator offering the necessary transparency&#13;
to avoid any investigations at a later date, with a view to identifying sufficiently qualified bidders and&#13;
ensuring that bids received are as advantageous as possible from the Government's point of view.&#13;
II.    TASKS TO BE PERFORMED BY THE CONSULTANTS&#13;
1.    Document review&#13;
The consultants will be required to review, and suggest any necessary changes to, the documents&#13;
that have been prepared, in particular the model operating contract between SOGEM and the private&#13;
operator (SEM) and the relevant specifications.&#13;
2.     Expressions of interest&#13;
In the event of a sparse response to the request for expressions of interest, the consultants may then&#13;
have to identify other prospective bidders likely to be interested and organize information meetings at&#13;
which to describe the project to them and obtain any additional statements of interest.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
79&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
3.     Prequalification&#13;
The consultants will have to prepare a prequalification package containing:&#13;
* relatively succinct information on sector reforms undertaken, the institutional framework, the technical&#13;
characteristics of the project, and the functions to be performed by the operator (Note: some of the&#13;
principal studies or legal documents prepared within the context of the reforms may be included in the&#13;
package);&#13;
* all of the relevant prequalification criteria, such as experience of technically and geographically similar&#13;
projects, minimum size of the prospective bidder's company (capitalization, number of hydroelectric&#13;
kWh produced, and/or number of employees, etc.), credit standing, financial results, etc.;&#13;
* the method of bid evaluation at the prequalification stage: for example, the award of a maximum&#13;
number of points for each criterion and the setting of a minimum number of points to be obtained by&#13;
each bidder. The establishment of a minimum threshold for individual key criteria may also be&#13;
considered;&#13;
* bid submission forms;&#13;
* the sum to be paid by prospective bidders to obtain the prequalification package.&#13;
* The consultants will be responsible for transmitting the prequalification packages to prospective&#13;
bidders.&#13;
They will send a written report to the technical committee on evaluation of the bids received at the&#13;
prequalification stage, and will assist the committee in identifying those bidders that prequalify.&#13;
4.     Preparation of the bidding documents&#13;
The consultants will prepare the bidding documents. These will comprise a package of information&#13;
for the bidders' use. The consultants will be required to prepare a document providing detailed information&#13;
on the project. This will include information on reforms undertaken in the sector, on the existing&#13;
institutional framework, on the sector's finances (SOGEM, OMVS), on the technical, hydrological and&#13;
environmental characteristics of the project, on the procedures for transferring SOGEM staff to the private&#13;
operator, on pricing mechanisms, on the obligations of the private operator, on the procedures for energy&#13;
exchanges among the different national electricity companies (SNEs), on the financial and technical&#13;
situation of the different SNEs, etc. The consultants will be responsible for listing, and if necessary&#13;
finalizing, all of the pertinent studies and other documentation, which they will attach to the bidding&#13;
documents. These will include: (i) the agreements establishing SOGEM and SOGED; (ii) SOGEM's&#13;
statutes; (iii) the draft SOGEM-SEM operating contract (including conditions of payment,&#13;
penalties/incentives, and supervision mechanisms) and attached specifications (nature of the installations,&#13;
operating conditions, characteristics of the service, performance indicators, etc.); (iv) the water use charter;&#13;
(v) the pricing protocol; (vi) hydrological and reservoir management studies; (vii) draft contracts between&#13;
the SNEs and SEM for the purchase of electricity; (viii) financial guarantee mechanisms established by the&#13;
SNEs; (ix) mechanisms for addressing water-related risks. etc.&#13;

80&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
The bidding documents should also contain a set of instructions to bidders, specifically including: (i) a&#13;
detailed description of the procedure for evaluating technical and financial bids and of the negotiation&#13;
process (these points are described in sections 7 and 8 below); (ii) information concerning the possibility of&#13;
visits to the site; (iii) procedures whereby bidders may request clarification or propose amendments to the&#13;
bidding documents; the bidding documents should specifically include instructions on the procedures&#13;
enabling bidders to have access to any useful information not included in those documents and also a&#13;
description of the organization meeting to be held for prequalified bidders (see Section 5 below); (iv) the&#13;
official formats and language in which bids are to be submitted; (v) the required minimum period of bid&#13;
validity; (vi) conditions under which bidders may propose any changes to the terms of the bid solicitation;&#13;
(vii) rules for extension of the bid submission deadline; (viii) conditions under which bids may be amended&#13;
or withdrawn; (ix) rules of confidentiality; (x) rules for the correction of any egregious errors contained in a&#13;
bid, etc.&#13;
The bidding documents should also include information on the guarantee mechanisms to be set up.&#13;
These will specifically include: (i) any sureties required of the parties (SOGEM and/or SEM) to guarantee&#13;
their respective obligations; (ii) any necessary mechanisms for the exercise of rights of expropriation or&#13;
rights of use of the public domain; (iii) insurance obligations, etc.&#13;
Lastly, the bidding documents will contain a set of standard documents to be completed by bidders.&#13;
These may include, for example: (i) form of letter of confirmation of a financial quotation; (ii) form of bid&#13;
security (to be provided by a bank); (iii) form of performance bond (if required); (iv) a document in which&#13;
bidders are to describe the methodology used in preparing their financial quotation; (v) a document in which&#13;
bidders provide information on their trade name, capitalization and capital structure, their audit reports, the&#13;
authority vested in their managers, etc.; (vi) a document listing the points on which an alternative to the&#13;
stipulations of the bidding documents would be acceptable (as an option, an alternative to the basic bid),&#13;
allowing bidders the freedom to draw up a list of the alternatives contained in their bid, etc. Once the draft&#13;
bidding documents have been approved by the client, subject to the donors' approval, the consultants will be&#13;
required to send copies of those documents to prequalified bidders.&#13;
5.     Communication with Candidates&#13;
In the bidding documents, the consultants will indicate the procedures to be followed by&#13;
candidates requiring further information on the documents or any other aspect of the project. They must&#13;
also gather all other items of information that are not included in the bidding documents but which could&#13;
be of interest to prequalified bidders, particularly information relating to the existing legal framework:&#13;
i.e. tax legislation, provisions governing convertibility and transfers of local currency and repatriation of&#13;
profits and dividends, and legislation governing employment, property, and the electric power sector in&#13;
the countries concerned, etc. The consultants should also gather supplementary technical information,&#13;
such as -- for example -- the topographical, seismological, and geological studies prepared prior to&#13;
construction of the Manantali dam, the civil engineering studies carried out for the construction of the&#13;
dam and the power facilities, a description of the various works contracts signed with the enterprises&#13;
responsible for the hydroelectric installations, studies on other project-related works (such as access&#13;
roads and transmission lines), etc. The consultants will also prepare a complete body of documentation&#13;
on the studies relating to the project's environmental and social impacts. All this information will be&#13;
presented to the candidates in a place, on a date, and in a manner to be specified in the bidding&#13;
documents.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
81&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
In addition, the consultants will prepare an information session for the prequalified candidates,&#13;
where the latter can ask questions on the content of the bidding documents and propose possible&#13;
amendments. The consultants will provide the selection committee with a written report on how this&#13;
session is to be organized (particularly the rules of procedure to be followed). During the meeting, they&#13;
will assist the authorities in their dialogue with the prequalified candidates. Afterwards, they will send a&#13;
written report to the technical committee, and this will include the questions and proposals raised by the&#13;
candidates, and the answers that may already have been provided at the meeting. The report will also&#13;
include the consultants' recommendations, with justifications, regarding those changes that they believe&#13;
should be made to the bidding documents. The consultants will then assist the committee in reaching its&#13;
decision.&#13;
6.     Finalization of the Bidding Documents&#13;
Based on the decisions taken as a result of the information session, the consultants and SOGEM&#13;
will finalize the bidding documents, and SOGEM will forward copies to the candidates.&#13;
7.     Evaluation of Bids&#13;
The consultants will assist the technical committee in evaluating bids. Candidates will be&#13;
required to submit bids in accordance with a two-envelope system, one envelope containing the technical&#13;
terms and the other the financial terms. The technical terms will be evaluated first, and assigned to one&#13;
of the following three categories: (i) acceptable; (ii) rejected; (iii) possibly acceptable, subject to&#13;
subsequent clarification. The only envelopes of financial terms to be opened will be those of candidates&#13;
submitting technical terms that are deemed acceptable, either immediately or after satisfactory&#13;
clarifications have been properly provided. The successful candidate will be the one offering the lowest&#13;
financial terms. This process will minimize the need for negotiations once the successful bidder has&#13;
been selected (since the latter will already have submitted acceptable technical terms and will have been&#13;
selected on the basis of the financial terms, and thus neither of these elements should require further&#13;
negotiation).&#13;
First, the consultants will examine the bids in order to ascertain whether any should be&#13;
automatically rejected as failing to meet the basic terms specified in the bidding documents. If they&#13;
consider this to be the case, they will send a written report to the technical committee explaining their&#13;
views, and will assist it in reaching a decision on the matter.&#13;
The consultants will then evaluate the technical terms of the bids, on the basis of criteria&#13;
identified in the bidding documents. They will forward a written report to the technical committee&#13;
presenting their reasons for placing each of the various bids in one of the above three categories. The&#13;
report will also specify what clarifications the consultants believe should be called for in the case of&#13;
those bids that may be judged acceptable once further details have been provided. They will assist the&#13;
committee in its decision-making on these various points.&#13;
The consultants will examine the additional information provided and determine whether it is&#13;
acceptable or not. They will then send a written report to the technical committee explaining their views&#13;
and will assist the committee in its decision-making on this point.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
82&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 5 of 7&#13;
The consultants will then examine the financial terms relating to the bids found acceptable in the&#13;
first stage of the process, and will forward their written conclusions to the committee, together with the&#13;
name of their choice of successful bidder. The bidding documents should give precise indications as to&#13;
how the financial terms are to be presented and how they will be compared. A combination of various&#13;
weighted criteria can be used, relating to factors such as the following: the levels of fixed income and&#13;
variable prices, margins (whether positive or negative) that would prove more favorable to SOGEM than&#13;
those quoted in the bidding documents, etc.&#13;
8.    Negotiations&#13;
As indicated in (7), one main purpose of the bid evaluation process described above is to limit&#13;
the extent of any negotiations; in practice, however, some changes to the technical terms of the bid and&#13;
the operating contract will be necessary once a successful candidate has been selected. There will also&#13;
be a need to finalize the guarantee or bond mechanisms.&#13;
The consultants will advise the committee during the negotiations, and endeavor to ensure that&#13;
the terms agreed are acceptable to all parties, so that a contract can be signed with the successful&#13;
candidate as soon as possible.&#13;
9.     Preparation for Contract Performance and Monitoring&#13;
The consultants will be responsible for preparing and implementing a training program for the&#13;
staff of SOGEM, to enable it to play a full role in contract implementation.&#13;
In particular, the consultants will be responsible for organizing and providing support for a&#13;
workshop and a series of working meetings for SEM and SOGEM. These activities will precede&#13;
implementation of the terms of the contract and enable the parties to understand and perform their&#13;
respective roles more fully.&#13;
It is calculated that the above services will require about 10-15 staff-months.&#13;
III. DOCUMENTATION TO BE PROVIDED&#13;
In performing their activities, the consultants should provide the following written documents:&#13;
*  any proposals for changes to the documents prepared before the consultants were hired;&#13;
*  reports identifying any action the consultants intend to take in order to elicit additional expressions&#13;
of interest;&#13;
*  prequalification documents;&#13;
*  a report on the evaluation of applications for prequalification;&#13;
*  bidding documents;&#13;
*  a list of all documents not included in the bidding documents, but which are to be forwarded to&#13;
candidates;&#13;
*  a report on the questions and proposals raised by candidates during the information session,&#13;
indicating the responses provided during the session and offering the consultants' recommendations -&#13;
- with justifications -- for amendments to the bidding documents;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
83&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
*  finalized bidding documents;&#13;
* a report containing the consultants' recommendations regarding whether certain bids should be&#13;
immediately rejected;&#13;
* a report containing the consultants' recommendations regarding whether further details of certain&#13;
bids should be called for;&#13;
* a report containing the consultants' recommendations regarding whether the bids for which further&#13;
details have been provided are acceptable;&#13;
* a report by consultants on the financial terms of the candidates' bids;&#13;
* a wrap-up report on the workshop and working sessions organized by the consultants to facilitate the&#13;
implementation and monitoring of contract activities;&#13;
* a training program, possibly prepared by the consultants.&#13;
IV.   SCHEDULE&#13;
The following proposed schedule takes account of the need for a private operator to be appointed&#13;
at least six months before the first unit is brought into operation in October 2000. If possible, the dates&#13;
given below should be brought forward, so as to provide room for maneuver if delays arise in hiring the&#13;
private operator. Moreover, the six months allowed for the operator to become familiarized with the&#13;
installations, participate in acceptance of the facilities, and train staff before the first unit is brought into&#13;
operation is definitely the minimum period possible.&#13;
* Process of hiring consultants: February-June 1998;&#13;
* appointment of consultants: beginning of July 1998;&#13;
* review of documents and possible request for additional expressions of interest: July-September&#13;
1998;&#13;

V.    ORGANIZATION&#13;
SOGEM will be the agency responsible for signing the contract with the consultants, and&#13;
reviewing and approving the various documents prepared by the consultants. SOGEM will conduct bid&#13;
evaluation and select the operator.&#13;
A technical committee could be established by SOGEM for the preparation of bidding&#13;
documents. The committee should be small and could consist of SOGEM staff and representatives of the&#13;
SNEs, OMVS High Commission, and the three countries involved.&#13;

REGIONAL HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Economic Analysis of the project&#13;
A. Least-cost solution for system expansion&#13;
1.    The alternative supply solution for each country would have been to proceed independently with&#13;
increments to their existing thermal plants. Integrated system planning studies have examined this&#13;
alternative and demonstrated that the least-cost solution is to develop Manantali to meet the combined&#13;
power needs of the three countries as projected by the load forecasts summarized in Annex 1, Table 1-3.&#13;
2.    Demand for electricity is growing in all three countries, but at differing rates. Over the past five&#13;
years, it has increased at an annual average rate of 7.8% in Mauritania, 7.2% in Mali and 5.1% in Senegal.&#13;
The load forecast shown above is considered to be realistic in the light of historical trends and projected&#13;
annual GDP growth of 5.6% in Senegal, 6.8% in Mauritania and 9.1% in Mali.&#13;
3.    OMVS's consultants (TRACTEBEL), compared an all-thermal, system expansion scenario with a&#13;
mixed hydro/thermal scenario in which the three power systems would be interconnected. The necessary&#13;
investments in generation capacity to meet demand over the next 20 years both with and without the&#13;
Manantali project are shown in Annex 1, Tables 1-6 and 1-7&#13;
4.    The key parameters used in the study to estimate the cost of the thermal alternative were:&#13;

5.     The equalizing discount rate was about 22%2, demonstrating the significant cost savings arising&#13;
from the development of Manantali. These savings arise from: (a) deferral of thermal investments, (b)&#13;
economies in fuel consumption and maintenance costs, and (c) opportunities for exchanges of power&#13;
between the three utilities to minimize overall system costs, by maximizing use of the lowest cost&#13;
generation plant, regardless of its location.&#13;
6.     A large number of variants were examined to confirm the robustness of the conclusions. These&#13;
include the use of the 1970-94 hydrological series instead of the 1950-94 series, the construction of the&#13;
transmission line only to Bamako, the deferral of one or two generating units in the power plant, the non-&#13;
utilization of the interconnection for thermal energy trading and the dropping of the branch line to&#13;
Nouakchott. Sensitivity analysis was also carried out to test the effects of lower oil prices, higher capital&#13;
costs, lower demand growth and delayed project commissioning. The key results are presented&#13;
below:&#13;

Interconnection to Nouakchott&#13;
7.     In order to assess the economic benefits of interconnecting Nouakchott to the main OMVS&#13;
transmission system, a scenario of investments and fuel costs for Nouakchott as an isolated system was&#13;
compared with the full project. The interconnection permits Mauritania to avoid the investment in 35 MW&#13;
of gas turbine between 1997 and 2010. Under both scenarios Mauritania is obliged to replace/add 35 MW&#13;
of diesel plant during the same period. The analysis shows that there is very little difference in total&#13;
investment cost between the 2 scenarios; - the discounted cost of the line is equivalent to that of the gas&#13;
turbine capacity. However, the net present worth of savings in fuel costs over the life of the project is CFAF&#13;
3 billion (US$ 6 million).&#13;
8.     The most significant variable influencing the project is its energy output. Table 10-3 shows the&#13;
range over which the average energy output can vary, depending on rainfall.&#13;

(Source: EdF, Etude de la Tarification de l'Energie Electrique, Septembre 1996)&#13;
9.     The estimates of output from Manantali shown in Table 10-3 take account of the need to provide an&#13;
artificial flood of about 5.5 billion cu.m, sufficient to allow the cultivation of at least 50,000 ha. by&#13;
traditional flood-recession methods. The energy output from the project would be approximately 100&#13;
GWlh/year higher on average, in the absence of this constraint. An analysis of the trade-off between electri-&#13;

city and flooding is given in Annex 10. A flood of this size strikes a reasonable balance between these two&#13;
competing uses for the water. Providing a larger flood would reduce the electricity output still further,&#13;
while eliminating the flood entirely to maximize electricity output would be too costly for a multitude of&#13;
economic, social, political and environmental reasons, as explained in Annex 10.&#13;
B. Project Benefits&#13;
10.   The average net electricity output of the project has been conservatively valued at the current&#13;
weighted average high voltage tariff of the three companies (CFAF 63/US$0.12 per kWh). This is&#13;
considered to be the minimum economic value of the plant output. Present low voltage tariffs are&#13;
significantly higher (CFAF 82/US$0.16 per kWh on average), and demonstrate that there is a consumer&#13;
willingness-to-pay considerably more than the value used to estimate the benefits of the project.&#13;
11.    Simulations carried out by OMVS' consultants show that the transmission lines to be built to bring&#13;
power from Manantali to the three capital cities will also be used to reverse the direction of power flows&#13;
when justified by fuel savings. For example, the heavy fuel oil units in Nouakchott produce electricity at a&#13;
lower cost than some of the units in Dakar and thus power from Nouakchott would flow to Senegal at&#13;
certain times. Similarly, there are expected to be periods when power would flow eastwards from Dakar to&#13;
Mali. The interconnection will thus allow system-wide fuel savings by optimizing the use of generation&#13;
plant. Such benefits have not been included in the estimate of the project's internal rate of return, although&#13;
they were part of the EDR calculation.&#13;
C. Economic Rate of Return&#13;
12.   The base case intemal rate of return (IRR) on the project was estimated to be 16%. Details of the&#13;
calculations are contained in Table 10-4 The investment already made in the dam was treated as a sunk cost&#13;
and excluded from the analysis. However, the loss in agricultural output arising from a 14,000 ha. reduction&#13;
in the average area of flood-recession cultivation was considered as a cost and included in the analysis.&#13;
Annex 10 on Reservoir management and Artificial Flooding explains the methodology used to derive these&#13;
estimates of lost agricultural benefits. Additional benefits to the energy sector from interconnection, such as&#13;
fuel savings from bilateral energy trading were excluded from the rate of return calculation.&#13;
D. Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
13.   The IRR falls to 11% (Table 10-5) if the annual average gross energy output over the 1970-94&#13;
period is used (547 GWh). The impact of a 10% cost over-run is to lower the base-case IRR to 10.6%.&#13;
However the risks of such an overrun are low, as bids have already been received for a significant portion of&#13;
the project. The effect of a one-year delay in completing the project is to reduce the base case IRR to 14%.&#13;
The risk of such an occurrence is considered low since the construction of a transmission line over flat&#13;
terrain does not present any particular technical difficulties and the process of land and rights-of-way&#13;
acquisition has already begun.&#13;
14.   The IRR is not sensitive to changes in the final demand for electricity because the plant would&#13;
mainly serve for base load, thereby allowing the national power companies to reduce the operations of&#13;
higher-cost thermal plant. The impact of lower than expected demand growth would therefore only be felt&#13;
in the utilization rate of thermal plant.&#13;
E. Probabilistic risk analysis&#13;
15.   A risk analysis was carried out to assess the impact on the project's IRR of the uncertainty in key&#13;
variables, particularly hydrology and energy output, project costs, construction time and the reduced&#13;
agricultural output from reduced flood-plain cultivation. A spreadsheet based software (Crystal Ball) was&#13;
used to that effect. In the simulations, probabilities of cost under/over runs were attached to each major&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex 9&#13;

project component. The full 1950-94 hydrological series (in the form of a truncated normal distribution&#13;
curve) was also used as a variable to model the possible energy output of the project, instead of a single&#13;
figure of average output. Finally, a range of estimated values for the lower agricultural production was also&#13;
included in the simulations.&#13;
16.   The risk analysis showed that the base-case IRR varies from 11.6% to 17.2% with an 90%&#13;
probability of being more than 13.1%. In the low-hydrology variant, the IRR ranges between 6.3% and&#13;
12.4% and has a 90% probability of being above 8.2%. Details are contained in Tables 10-7 and 10-8.&#13;

REGIONAL POWER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Reservoir Management: Artificially Augmented Flooding and Energy Production&#13;
1.      The multi-purpose nature of the Manantali project means that its maximum potential energy output&#13;
is constrained by the need to take into account other uses for the water stored in the reservoir. In the long&#13;
term, irrigation will require a constant flow in the dry season of at least 100 cubic meters per second&#13;
(cusecs) at Bakel, while the future needs of shipping3 would raise this to 200 cusecs. These flows would not&#13;
conflict with power generation, as the water would first pass through the turbines. In theory; it would&#13;
therefore be possible to operate the reservoir so as to maximize electricity production. On the other hand,&#13;
the OMVS member states have concluded that there are strong economic, social, political and&#13;
environmental reasons (paras. 2-6) to perpetuate the traditional flooding of the flat plain along the Senegal&#13;
river between Bakel and Dagana. This gives rise to an obligation to release sufficient water from the&#13;
Manantali reservoir to create an 'artificial' flood4 at the end of the rainy season. The volumes required for&#13;
the flood mean that some water may be spilled without being used for power generation, which in turn&#13;
imposes a cost in terms of foregone energy generation in the ensuing dry season.&#13;
Rationale for an artificial flood&#13;
2.      The flood has numerous beneficial features5 which justify perpetuating it artificially at least for&#13;
another twenty years, the time required for it to be progressively replaced by irrigated agriculture. The main&#13;
benefits are environmental and agricultural. The latter are easy to quantify as the flood permits the&#13;
cultivation of sorghum on the flood plain. It is a significant source of complementary income (para. 3) and&#13;
food security for over one hundred thousand households in the Senegal Valley. Flood-recession agriculture&#13;
is an economic activity that is unlikely to be abandoned voluntarily by peasants, because it requires no cash&#13;
inputs and much less labor than irrigated agriculture and is almost risk-free. Socio-anthropological research&#13;
shows that the majority of the population of the Senegal Valley relies on three sources of income: irrigated&#13;
agriculture, recession cultivation and external remittances. Elimination of flood-recession cultivation would&#13;
thus further increase the pressure to migrate to urban areas, given the generally poor performance of&#13;
irrigated agriculture, which has failed to become a source of adequate revenues for most rural households .&#13;
3    This aspect of river development is mainly of interest to Mali and is unlikely to become a serious possibility over the next 10-15 years.&#13;
4    i.e. not solely by nature, but brought about through deliberate human action to augment water flows from the unregulated tributaries of the&#13;
Senegal River.&#13;
5    See Working Paper No. 54 of the Institute for Development Anthropology, by Horowitz &amp; Salem-Murdock, Nov. 1990.&#13;
6    The high cost of inputs, problems of agricultural credit and crop marketing are some of the factors hindering irrigated rice cultivation.&#13;
&#13;

Economic benefits of the flood&#13;
3.     Average yields from flood-recession cultivation are about 600 kg. of sorghum per hectare. At&#13;
7&#13;
today's producer price , this is worth CFAF 64,000/ha. Livestock grazing on crop residues represents&#13;
another benefit from flood-recession agriculture. This has been estimated at over 50,000 CFAF/ha. . Thus,&#13;
directly quantifiable benefits are about CFAF 114,000 (US$ 228)/ha. The average reduction in the&#13;
cultivated area of about 20,000 ha. due to the electricity project would therefore result in an annual average&#13;
loss of about US$ 4.5 million of agricultural output.&#13;
4.     Researchers have also established that the existence of a flood was crucial to the reproduction of&#13;
fish. However, as the fish population of the river had been decimated by the severe droughts of the late&#13;
1970s/early 1980s, the perpetuation of the flood will require accompanying measures to reconstitute fish&#13;
stocks and revitalize river fishing as an income-generating activity. This issue will be examined as part of&#13;
the project's environmental mitigation measures.&#13;
5.     It has been found that Acacia forests depended for their survival on periodic inundation of their&#13;
roots that occurred during floods. However, due to continuing severe deforestation, (mainly for charcoal&#13;
production) in the Senegal Valley, the perpetuation of a flood will contribute little to the survival of the&#13;
remaining trees. They are much more vulnerable to charcoal producers than to lack of flood water.&#13;
6.     There is also a link between the flood and the recharge of shallow acquifers that are tapped for&#13;
village water supply in the Senegal Valley, although this has not been conclusively established. Eliminating&#13;
the flood might therefore jeopardize village water supply, and require costly deep boreholes as an alternative&#13;
water source for villages.&#13;
Size and nature of the artificial flood&#13;
7.     The area flooded varies widely from year to year, depending on rainfall in the catchment area,&#13;
hundreds of kilometers upstream. Historically, over 300,000 ha were flooded in the wettest years and as&#13;
little as 20,000 ha. in the driest ones. However, during the drought years of the 1970s and 1980s, there was&#13;
no flood at all. The construction of the Manantali dam permits OMVS to provide a flood more often than&#13;
would occur naturally if the river had remained unregulated, provided that this does not conflict with the&#13;
requirement to provide a constant dry-season flow for pumped irrigation. The proposed addition of a power&#13;
generation project puts further constraints on the size of the artificial flood.&#13;
8.     Considerable uncertainty prevails regarding the appropriate area of the artificial flood and the&#13;
volume of water that would have to be released from Manantali to achieve it. The relationships between&#13;
volume and duration of water flows in the river and the extent of the areas inundated are not well quantified.&#13;
Further uncertainty arises from the fact that only about 60 percent of the flows at Bakel are directly related&#13;
to releases from Manantali. The remainder comnes from the other, uncontrolled tributaries of the Senegal, in&#13;
particular the Fal6me and Bakoye. In wet years, the flows from these tribut-&#13;
7   The average price in 1995 was 107 CFAF/kg.&#13;
Horowitz &amp; Salem-Murdock estimated livestock benefits to be CFAF 17,500/ha. based on a liveweight price of CFAF 200/kg. The latter has&#13;
now risen to about CFAF 600/kg. in Senegal. The same increase was therefore applied to the benefits per hectare.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

aries alone would provide a good flood. An (ongoing) reservoir management study is examining these&#13;
issues with a view to putting in place a monitoring system that will allow the timing of releases from the&#13;
reservoir to be coordinated with the maximum flows from the other tributaries. This will enable&#13;
minimization of the amount of water to be spilled. Other characteristics of the flood itself, such as the&#13;
optimal rate and duration of submergence are also not well understood. They are important because the area&#13;
actually cultivated is generally much less9 than the total flooded area because land inundated for less than 15&#13;
days absorbs insufficient water to sustain a crop, while land submerged for over 45 days becomes available&#13;
too late for cultivation.&#13;
9.     After many years of debate, it has been agreed that OMVS should operate the Manantali reservoir in&#13;
such a way as to ensure that on average there is an artificial flood sufficient to enable the cultivation of&#13;
50,000 ha. as often as possible. Due to the high variability in rainfall, a flood cannot be guaranteed every&#13;
year. The requirement to produce a flood will be waived in years when the available water would be&#13;
insufficient to meet pumped irrigation requirements, but takes priority over electricity generation. A flood&#13;
of this size would strike a reasonable balance between these two mutually exclusive uses for the water.&#13;
Providing a larger flood would reduce the electricity output and render the proposed project uneconomic,&#13;
while eliminating the flood entirely to maximize electricity output would be too costly for a multitude of&#13;
economic, social, political and environmental reasons.&#13;
10.    However, the volume of water that must be released from  Manantali to achieve a minimum&#13;
cultivable flooded area of 50,000 ha. is not known with precision. This uncertainty in turn affects the&#13;
energy output of the project. Current estimates of OMVS indicate that the necessary flood would require&#13;
5.5 billion m3 of water over a period of about six weeks starting in the first half of September. However,&#13;
only 1.6 billion m3. would come from Manantali. It would peak at 2500 cusecs for a 6-7 day period and&#13;
remain above 1600 cusecs for about 12 days. Spilling from Manantali would be minimized if releases could&#13;
be timed to coincide with the maximum flows from the other tributaries of the Senegal River. This may be&#13;
possible once rainfall and water inflow data gathering is improved in the catchment area of the tributaries.&#13;
The above flood parameters limit the average net energ output from Manantali to between 547 and 804&#13;
GWh, depending on the hydrological time series used.    o&#13;
11.    A recent study  of the three alternative ways of operating the Manantali dam has quantified the&#13;
trade-offs between energy and agriculture. The option of subordinating electricity production to agricultural&#13;
needs (Scenario A in the Table below), which is closest to a 'no-electricity project' scenario, predictably&#13;
results in the highest average area cultivated and lowest average energy output. The option of maximizing&#13;
electricity production (after meeting irrigation needs) has the opposite result (Scenario B). In between these&#13;
two extremes lies the preferred strategy (C) of a controlled flood that enables some recession cultivation as&#13;
well as an adequate output of electricity.&#13;
150,000 ha. is the upper estimate of the area actually cultivated.&#13;
0 The 1950-94 hydrological series results in the higher predicted energy output compared to the 1970-94 series.&#13;

N.B. The electricity production shown in the above table differs from the earlier estimates (para 10) due to a different reservoir&#13;
operations model.&#13;
12.     Under the 1950-93 hydrological series, the average energy output from Manantali would be about&#13;
7% higher without the constraint to provide an artificial flood, but there would then be an unacceptable&#13;
reduction in the frequency of occurrence of the flood12 The proposed reservoir management strategy is thus&#13;
a compromise that strikes a reasonable balance between these competing uses for the water. Providing a&#13;
larger flood than 5.5 billion cu. m would further reduce the electricity output while only marginally&#13;
increasing the area cultivated.&#13;
13.     For the above reasons there is a consensus that the socioeconomic and environmental benefits of an&#13;
artificial flood are sufficiently important to justify it, even if this reduces the energy output from Manantali.&#13;
The lost average energy output of about 100 GWh/year (Table 1) has an average value of 70 FCFA/kWh'3,&#13;
or an annual loss of about CFAF 7 billion (US$14 million), which is significantly higher than the&#13;
agricultural benefits from the additional 20,000 ha. of cultivation (US$4.5 million). However, including the&#13;
non-quantified social and environmental benefits would swing the balance in favor of the flood. In the very&#13;
long-term, there would be competition between irrigated and flood-recession agriculture, both for land as&#13;
well as water, but the present slow pace of expansion of the areas under irrigation means that this is unlikely&#13;
for the next 20 years.&#13;
12 Priority to electricity would have meant no flood plain cultivation under the rainfall regime of the last 18 years. Instead, under the proposed&#13;
reservior operating rule, the requisite flood would have occured in 9 out of 18 years, although this would still mean four less occurrences&#13;
compared to a scenario where full priority is given to flooding at the expense of electricity production.&#13;
13 This is the present average tariff in the OMVS countries.&#13;

REGIONAL HYDROPOWER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Environmental, Social and Health Aspects&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    Two Environmental Assessment (EA) studies were conducted by OMVS in 1993-96 with&#13;
support of internationally renowned firms, in close coordination with the preparation of bidding&#13;
documents for project components, in particular transmission lines and civil works. OMVS has prepared&#13;
a synthesis of the Environmental Assessment (EA) studies, as well as a comprehensive environmental&#13;
mitigation and monitoring plan (PASIE) with detailed costs and financing plan, with the support of&#13;
internationally experienced environmental management consultants. The EA, the EA Summary and the&#13;
PASIE have been disclosed in the three countries and shared with local NGOs. The Canadian&#13;
Government executed an independent evaluation of the environmental impacts and mitigation plan of the&#13;
project. The results of this independent evaluation are in line with the results of the EAs conducted by&#13;
OMVS.&#13;
2.    The main environmental impacts are not caused by the proposed Regional Hydropower&#13;
Development Project, but rather by the existing dams of Manantali and Diama on the Senegal river.&#13;
However, it is impossible to mitigate the impacts of the hydropower project only, without addressing the&#13;
problems created by the management of the dams themselves. Therefore, the mitigation plan of the&#13;
Hydropower Project will take into account the partial mitigation of some of the most serious&#13;
environmental and health impacts of the two dams.&#13;
3.    This annex presents successively: (a) impacts due to the power plant and the electric&#13;
transmission lines and the mitigation of these impacts, (b) impacts due to the management of the dams,&#13;
(c) mitigation measures to limit the impacts due to the management of the dams; and (d) the institutional&#13;
organization to implement mitigation measures and monitor environment impacts.&#13;
DIRECT IMPACTS OF THE PROJECT AND THEIR MITIGATION&#13;
Impacts of Transmission Towers and Lines, Substations, Access Roads, Construction Camps and&#13;
Labor Force&#13;
4.    With respect to resettlement and related issues, the major social impacts of the Regional&#13;
Hydropower Development Project are the partial/permanent loss of property and land use rights.&#13;
Partialpermanent loss of agricultural land will be primarily the result of land taken in order to establish&#13;
the transmission towers and substations, access roads and construction work areas. The routing of the&#13;
transmission lines has been chosen to avoid as much as possible sensitive ecosystems and protected areas&#13;
such as forest areas, cultural sites and natural habitats for migratory species. Attention has been given to&#13;
the environmental regulatory framework requirements in the three countries. Other sensitive areas that&#13;
were avoided were the area West and Northwest of Richard Toll and the area of Richard Toll itself where&#13;
a rapid urbanization is expected. For the major part the transmission lines pass through open plains with&#13;
scattered trees and light bushes, the typical Sahelian landscape.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
104&#13;
Annex 11&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
5.    The main potential impacts of transmission lines will be in the more densely populated areas,&#13;
such as around Bamako and at the Senegal river crossing at Dagana. Impacts will be limited in the areas&#13;
outside the Senegal River floodplain and in parts of the higher river basin. Losses of land would be both&#13;
permanent and temporary in nature and variety of mitigation measures will be deployed to address these&#13;
issues, including proper routing/placement of transmission infrastructure and construction work sites to&#13;
avoid agricultural land where possible.&#13;
6.     Land expropriation will take place around Bamako. It is mainly caused by the 30-50 meters&#13;
wide corridor needed for Right of Way (ROW) for the transmission lines. Agricultural activities will be&#13;
allowed under the transmission lines, apart from a 3-meter wide strip needed for access. This reduces&#13;
considerably the loss of agricultural and agro-pastoral lands and reduces compensation costs.&#13;
7.     A Resettlement Action Plan has been prepared in accordance with OD 4.30. On the basis of the&#13;
land tenure legislation of each of the three countries, detailed land acquisition plans and compensation&#13;
mechanisms for loss of property and land use rights have been prepared for the three different&#13;
transmission lines. Conditions for the implementation of the relevant procedures are specified, including&#13;
a fair compensation scheme and available means of redress.&#13;
8.    Another important point is the crossing of protected forests, which might affect wildlife and&#13;
biodiversity. Forest specialists have proposed to protect equivalent areas in the neighborhood.&#13;
9.     The implementation of the mitigation plan will be carefully monitored. The environmental unit&#13;
in OMVS will be strengthened for this purpose. Maximization of benefits of the project will also be&#13;
achieved notably by providing local employment.&#13;
Environmental Supervision on Construction Activities&#13;
10.   Comprehensive environmental management procedures are included in the bidding documents&#13;
for the contractor, which include among other proper location an rehabilitation of construction camps,&#13;
prohibition of firewood collection and hunting, adequate sanitary facilities and proper disposal of toxic&#13;
chemicals such as engine oils, etc. Also adequate health facilities for screening and treatment of&#13;
contractor-staff will be established and an AIDS prevention mechanism e.g., the free provision of&#13;
condoms and a health education program of the staff of the contractor will be in place&#13;
11.   The team who will supervise the works will include Environmental inspectors. These inspectors&#13;
will be trained and will ensure that the environmental clauses stated in the contracts are adhered to.&#13;

IMPACTS DUE TO THE MANAGEMENT OF EXISTING MANANTALI AND DIAMA DAMS&#13;
Impacts of the Manantali Dam&#13;
12.   Originally, the main objective of the Manantali dam was to respond to the drought and famine&#13;
of the 1970s and 80s, which had devastating impacts on flood recession agriculture, floodplain fisheries,&#13;
floodplain dry season pastures, and recharge of the aquifers. The dam, which was not financed by the&#13;
World Bank, was finished in 1988 and its objectives were hydropower, irrigation development and&#13;
navigation. The major environmental and social impacts of the Manantali dam come from the&#13;
attenuation of the yearly floods and its impacts on downstrearn users. Special emphasis was placed on&#13;
the following impacts of the Manantali dam (thus not the proposed regional hydropower development&#13;
project) mainly in the middle valley of the Senegal river basin: (a) loss of flood recession agriculture; (b)&#13;
impacts on the area of dry season pastures, which are traditional grazing lands for agro-pastoralists; (c)&#13;
impacts on fisheries resources, which lead to reduced catches; (d) impacts on the Gonakie forests, which&#13;
need regular flooding (heavy human pressure has decimated these forests further); (e) possible negative&#13;
impact on the recharge of shallow aquifers in and near the floodplain (this last impact is not confirmed).&#13;
It should, however, be noted that many of these impacts were already occurring because of the drought&#13;
years. In the Manantali reservoir itself, there was an outbreak of bilharzia or schistosomiasis, especially&#13;
of Schistosoma mansoni, the cause of intestinal bilharzia which did not occur before in the Manantali&#13;
area.&#13;
Impact of the Diama Dam&#13;
13    Basically, the Manantali and Diama dams can be operated completely independently of each&#13;
other. The main objective of the Diama dam is to allow development of irrigated agriculture in the dry&#13;
season by eliminating the saline intrusion of seawater, which could reach up to more than 200 km&#13;
upstream. The Diama dam has created an invaluable freshwater body, which included Lake Guiers-Bas&#13;
Ferlo, the main drinking water source for the city of Dakar. The major health impact caused by the&#13;
constant water level of Diama reservoir and lake Guiers is the outbreak of a serious epidemic of the&#13;
intestinal form of bilharzia (Schistosoma mansoni), which has Biomphalaria pfeifferi as its snail vector.&#13;
This snail species cannot bury itself in the mud and therefore cannot survive under relatively rapid water&#13;
level fluctuations, which provide a mechanism for controlling these snail populations. Another impact of&#13;
the Diama dam is the cut-off of migratory routes for aquatic organisms such as important commercial&#13;
fish species.&#13;
MITIGATION OF THE IMPACTS OF THE MANANTALI AND DIAMA DAMS&#13;
Reservoir Management Plan and Artificial Flood&#13;
14.   The Manantali Reservoir will be operated as a multi-purpose reservoir in agreement with a&#13;
Reservoir Management Manual, which is under preparation as part of the Reservoir Management&#13;
Optimization Program. This program is an essential part of the overall mitigation plan. The installation&#13;
and operation of the hydropower plant, if the operation includes the creation of an optimized artificial&#13;
flood, will cause positive changes in the hydrological regime of the Senegal river downstream of the&#13;
dam, as compared to the existing situation without the hydropower plant (i.e. without optimization of&#13;
artificial flood in timing and volume).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
106&#13;
Annex 11&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
15.   It is expected that the optimized artificial flood will re-establish in large part, except in the driest&#13;
years, the traditional floodplain functions impacted by the Manantali Dam, including significant&#13;
increases in flood recession agriculture, dry season pastures and crop residues, and increase in fish&#13;
production. The latter is linearly related to the flooded area and flood duration. There would also be&#13;
regeneration of forest resources, although this is strongly dependent on improved management of these&#13;
resources. There is also a possible improved recharge of nearby shallow aquifers, which are used for&#13;
village water supply. To monitor the impacts of the artificial floods a comprehensive monitoring system&#13;
will be put in place, including field evaluation, which will allow timely detection of negative and positive&#13;
effects of the river flow manipulation.&#13;
16.   The minimum target area for flood recession agriculture has been taken as 50,000 ha (about two&#13;
thirds in Senegal and one third in Mauritania). This is based on a study prepared by an international team&#13;
of experts in 1987, which defined a minimal flood of 2,500 m3/h in one week (called Gibb A), to meet&#13;
recession agriculture needs. During the rest of the year the Manantali dam will release an adequate and&#13;
regulated flow to allow irrigated agriculture. OMVS has tried to maintain an artificial flood since the&#13;
construction of the Manantali dam, although there were problems with the timing of the flood, because of&#13;
the lack of adequate flood prediction equipment and flood management methods. Such equipment will&#13;
be installed under the project to optimize the artificial flood. A communication system will be installed&#13;
to warn riparian populations about flood arrival. The exact scope and timing of the artificial flood will&#13;
be defined through comprehensive studies for optimizing the management of water resources from the&#13;
Manantali reservoir, which should allow exceeding the above mentioned target area for flood recession&#13;
agriculture. The optimization program will be finalized before project completion and be formalized&#13;
through an agreement (Charte) between the three Governments, OMVS and SOGEM on a reservoir&#13;
management program and the corresponding procedures (Manuel de Gestion). The terms of reference of&#13;
these studies, which will be financed by the French Government, have been defined by international&#13;
experts (see outline in Appendix). To achieve joint decision making and operation of the reservoir&#13;
management, local communities will continuously participate in the studies through local coordination&#13;
committees. This process will be financed by the Bank and managed by OMVS High Commission, in&#13;
coordination with SOGEM.&#13;
17.   A preliminary hydrology study conducted in 1996 by ORSTOM for project preparation indicates&#13;
that there would be on average a reduction in flood recession agriculture from 45,000 to 30,000 ha (based&#13;
on the 1979-1993 series) or from 85,000 to 73,000 ha (based on the series 1950-1993), as compared to&#13;
the situation without the power plant. However, it should be noted that these results assume an optimum&#13;
management of the Manantali dam, which requires accurate forecasts of the flows. This is not possible&#13;
today without the forecast system that will be implemented during the Reservoir Management&#13;
Optimization Program that is part of the project.&#13;
Manantali Reservoir Health Aspects&#13;
18.   The creation of the Manantali Reservoir has increased the incidence rates of bilharzia, including&#13;
the intestinal form of bilharzia. The project will investigate measures to reduce these incidence rates to&#13;
acceptable levels. At present bilharzia snail vector and prevalence rate baseline data are being established&#13;
and a monitoring program has started (see Appendix). Patients will be treated and a health education&#13;
program will be initiated by the Schistosomiasis Program of the Republic of Mali.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
107&#13;
Annex 11&#13;
Page 5 of 7&#13;
Diama Reservoir and Lake Guiers Health Aspects&#13;
19.   After the creation of the Diama Reservoir in 1986, with its constant water level, there was and&#13;
still is an explosion of intestinal bilharzia. The problem is serious, specially since there is drug&#13;
resistance of the intestinal bilharzia parasite against the preferred drug. If no adequate action is taken,&#13;
infected people would suffer severe disability and death. The most affected areas are Canal de Taouey&#13;
and Lac Guiers and to a lesser extent around the Diama Reservoir in Senegal. Although this impact is not&#13;
caused by the proposed regional hydropower development project, the project will establish some pilot&#13;
projects to investigate practical and least-cost measures, including artificial water level fluctuations in&#13;
the Diama Reservoir, to reduce the man-snail vector contact and to reduce in this manner the&#13;
transmission and incidence rate of intestinal bilharzia at the Senegalese side (no intestinal bilharzia has&#13;
been observed on the Mauritania side).&#13;
20.   In several heavily bilharzia infested villages, pilot projects will be implemented. These pilot&#13;
projects will include shore improvements in the form of cemented banks with easy access, removal of&#13;
aquatic weeks (mainly Typha spec.), and a monitoring program of bilharzia snail vector population&#13;
densities and infection rates. At the same time, human populations in the area will be screened and&#13;
treated for intestinal bilharzia through the ESPOIR program (created in 1991 by the Government of&#13;
Senegal to coordinate schistosomiasis-related research and monitoring activities, with the financial and&#13;
technical support of the EU, the FAC, the Pasteur Institute and several European Universities). A similar&#13;
approach will be followed to investigate the effects of water level fluctuations in the Diama reservoir in&#13;
Senegal. The ESPOIR program would execute the bilharzia control and treatment activities, while the&#13;
health education component would be financed under the upcoming World Bank Senegal Endemic&#13;
Disease Control Project (to be launched in July 1997). It is expected that this approach will reduce the&#13;
intestinal bilharzia problem. There is no plan to introduce snail eating exotic fish species in the Diama&#13;
reservoir, since the introduction of exotic fish species might cause more problems than they solve. The&#13;
Senegal Long-term Water Sector Project also includes a study on the bilharzia snail in the light of the&#13;
resistance of the intestinal bilharzia parasite against the preferred drug, alternative control methods&#13;
should be developed, e.g., the use or competitor and predator snails to control the intestinal bilharzia&#13;
snail vector populations. These activities would be financed under health-related projects, under the&#13;
supervision of the Ministry of Health.&#13;
21.    Other projects which can address the remaining health impacts, e.g. through community based&#13;
water supply around Richard Toll, bilharzia snail vector habitat elimination in the Compagnie Sucriere&#13;
Senegalaise (CSS) sugar cane production area and experiments with biological control agents (such as&#13;
competitor and predator snail species to control bilharzia vector snails), are listed below:&#13;

Other Risks&#13;
22.   Hydrological risks. Hydrological risks, in the form of decreased rainfall, exacerbated by climatic&#13;
changes induced by global warming are unknown at present. No long-term predictions exist for West&#13;
Africa. It is unknown if the trend of the last 25 years of decreasing rainfall will persist, get worse or&#13;
improve.&#13;
22.   Dam safety. A five-year inspection of the Manantali dam and its electromechanical equipment&#13;
conducted by a reputable independent engineering group in June-July 1996 revealed no major flaws and&#13;
confirmed that adequate staffing, procedures and instrumentation were in place for monitoring and&#13;
maintenance of the existing facilities. Civil works for the power substation already include all remedial&#13;
work identified during the inspection. Additional information has been requested from the inspector&#13;
concerning possible seepage under the dam and uplift in the pelite rock area, and has been reviewed&#13;
during appraisal and found satisfactory.&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL ORGANIZATION&#13;
Participation of Key Stakeholders&#13;
23.   Local populations, key stakeholders and beneficiaries will participate through the local&#13;
coordination committees to be created (para. 27). Publications in the local press will inform the civil&#13;
society about the project and indicate places where additional information can be obtained.  In&#13;
collaboration with the Bank, OMVS is preparing a brochure with questions and answers about the project&#13;
and environment issues, which will be available in French and in the local languages in the valley in the&#13;
three countries. The EA preparation involved the identification and consultation of key stakeholders.&#13;
Public meetings were held in 16 communities with 10 to 50 persons in each community. The&#13;
Environmental Management Plan includes the preliminary identification of further consultation needed&#13;
at the level of local communities during and after construction..&#13;
Environmental Capacity Strengthening&#13;
24.   The implementation of the project will be coupled with the strengthening of OMVS's and&#13;
SOGEM's environmental management capacity. In this context, it is to be noted that the French&#13;
government is supporting the establishment of an Environmental Monitoring Office within OMVS&#13;
(Observatoire de 1 'Energie). This office will develop environmental indicators and establish an adequate&#13;
and demand driven environmental monitoring system. Such a process is part of a comprehensive&#13;
approach to sustainable water resources and energy management. SOGEM will be charged of the&#13;
implementation of the PASIE programs for impact mitigation during construction and for resettlement&#13;
and compensation, and will be assisted in this task by experts from the supervising Engineer. SOGEM's&#13;
Limnology Unit (formerly under OMVS High Commission) will receive support to execute the&#13;

hydrobiological and fisheries monitoring components downstream and upstream of the Manantali Dam,&#13;
as well as the monitoring of the Manantali reservoir, which will form part of the Manantali reservoir&#13;
optimization program.&#13;
Preparation of the Reservoir Management Program&#13;
25.   The OMVS High Commission has the overall responsibility for supervising and coordinating the&#13;
preparation of the Manantali reservoir management program and monitoring its proper application,&#13;
whereas SOGEM will be charged of implementing the program, through the private operator. All studies&#13;
will be coordinated by OMVS High Commission through an ad-hoc Committee and the Local&#13;
Coordination Committees and with technical assistance (for example under the form of a Panel of&#13;
Experts). Several workshops will be organized to review interim results of studies and re-orient the&#13;
preparation of the program and define complementary studies, as needed.&#13;
Supervising Consultants (Maitre-d'Oeuvre)&#13;
26.   The Supervising Consultant will employ an Environmental Monitoring Specialist, who will be&#13;
based in Dakar during the construction period. The Environmental Specialist will be assisted by staff&#13;
based in the field for the day-to-day environmental monitoring. The OMVS and SOGEM have already&#13;
informed potential contractors about the environmental standards and management procedures for the&#13;
construction of the transmission lines and the hydropower plant.&#13;
Local Coordination Committees&#13;
27.   The Local Coordination Committees (LCCs) will be responsible for the implementation of the&#13;
land expropriation, resettlement, compensation, the rural electrification studies and other environmental&#13;
mitigation measures. They will also participate in the preparation of the reservoir management plan. The&#13;
LCCs will include representatives of civil society, local and regional authorities, NGOs, etc. The project&#13;
will contribute to finance operational costs of the LCCs. The Supervising Consultant will participate in&#13;
the LCCs and play a critical role in the Secretariat and in the financial management of the LCCs. The&#13;
Direction of the LCCs will be chosen according to the national legislation in the three different countries.&#13;

Brief Outline of Reservoir Management Studies&#13;
1.1    The Reservoir Management Studies includes a hydrological part which will start in the rainy&#13;
season of 1997 and will be executed by ORSTOM under OMVS supervision, and financed by FAC. For&#13;
this purpose, temporary flood prediction equipment will be installed in Guinea, upstream of the&#13;
Manantali dam. The studies involve the analysis of past reservoir management (1987-1995), real time&#13;
forecast of flows, optimization of the flood hydrograph, elaboration of a mathematical model and the&#13;
preparation of a reservoir management manual (technical specifications). The hydrological part of the&#13;
studies is combined with remote sensing activities (the Bank will finance satellite images and processing&#13;
of these images) to determine the extent of the flood in a selected part of the floodplain (test zones will&#13;
be in the Podor and Matam areas) and field observations to monitor and evaluate the extent and impacts&#13;
of floods to calibrate and optimize the flood hydrograph, through an iterative process. However, the&#13;
optimization of the flood hydrograph will cover the entire flooded area in the floodplain. A groundwater&#13;
baseline survey has been finished and the results will be used in the optimization of the flood&#13;
hydrograph. Hydrobiological and fisheries monitoring activities in the upper and middle valley, based&#13;
on field surveys and analysis of satellite imagery, will be executed in 1998 and 1999, with financing&#13;
from Canada. The years 1997 and 1998 will be used to calibrate the mathematical model. It is expected&#13;
that the optimization of the flood hydrograph will be achieved after the artificial flood of 1999.&#13;
1.2    The Reservoir Management Program will be based on the simulation of multi-use reservoir&#13;
management scenarios and the cost-benefit analysis of the different scenarios and will include the&#13;
preparation of a reservoir management guidelines and procedures that will form part of bidding&#13;
documents for recruiting the private operator and will then be included in the operator's contract. A&#13;
Charter for Water Resource Management will be prepared and subscribed by the three Governments. It&#13;
will specify modalities for its revision, arrangements for driest years and dispositions for management of&#13;
possible conflicts between water users.&#13;
1.3    The status of the Reservoir Management Program will be reviewed during the project launching&#13;
workshop in October 1997 and a detailed action plan will be prepared at that time.&#13;
Brief Outline of Health Impact Mitigation in the Manantali Reservoir&#13;
1.4    Until present the health data collection was limited to the following activities:&#13;
a.    Inventory of the different bilharzia snail vector populations: Bulinus species and Biomphalaria&#13;
species;&#13;
b.    Monitoring of the presence of these snail populations on the banks of the reservoir;&#13;
c.    Microscopic analysis of the state of the snails (e.g. if they are dead or alive).&#13;
1.5    Another activity will be added to provide a clearer picture of the current situation:&#13;
d.    Based on available data from the Mali Schistosomiasis Program, a baseline will be established in&#13;
relation to the location of the human settlements and the prevalence levels of bilharzia in these&#13;
populations. A separation would be made between urinary bilharzia and intestinal bilharzia. On&#13;
the basis of these data, pilot villages will be chosen for a monthly monitoring program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

1.6    During the implementation of the artificial flood at the end of the 1997 rainy season, the water&#13;
level in the Manantali Reservoir will fall rapidly. To obtain an insight in the impacts of this rapid water&#13;
level fluctuation on the bilharzia snail vector populations a study will be undertaken during a period of&#13;
two years by the Manantali Limnology Unit, which will be strengthened for this purpose, and the Mali&#13;
Schistosomiasis Program with the following objectives:&#13;
a.     To obtain an insight in the population dynamics of the bilharzia snail vector populations, which&#13;
are actually present on the banks of the Manantali Reservoir;&#13;
b.     Evaluation of the impacts of the reservoir water level variations on these snail  vector&#13;
populations. For this purpose the speed, the magnitude, the duration and the frequency of the&#13;
reservoir level fluctuations will be monitored and specific variations will also be tested.&#13;
1.7    The study includes the following components:&#13;
a.    Identification of the contact points between the human population and the snail vectors and the&#13;
different snail habitats;&#13;
b.     Site selection for the monthly monitoring program;&#13;
c.     Establishing for each selected site the contact time man-snail vector;&#13;
d.     Laboratory analysis to investigate if snails are infected, after which snails are returned to their&#13;
original sites.&#13;
e.     Habitat changes at each site, e.g. vegetation type, quality of the substrate, water velocity, water&#13;
turbidity and water level;&#13;
f.     Evaluation of the impact of the water level fluctuations on the snail vector population, e.g.&#13;
determination of the mortality rate through for instance desiccation;&#13;
g.     Registration of climatic data: temperature, humidity and rainfall.&#13;
1.8    The staff of the Manantali Limnology Unit will be trained in bilharzia research methods by the&#13;
staff of the Mali Schistosomiasis Program. Patients will be treated through the Mali Schistosomiasis&#13;
Program, which will also identify and implement specific measures to reduce the incidence of bilharzia&#13;
around the Manantali reservoir.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Regional Hydropower Development
            Project's main objectives are to: (i) reduce the
            long-term cost of electricity supply to the 3 countries;
            (ii) contribute to meeting debt service associated with the
            building of the Manantali dam; (iii) contribute to
            increasing the efficiency and reliability of power systems;
            (iv) establish an effective organization to construct and
            operate the project facilities and to mitigate environment
            and health impacts of the projects and the Manantali dam;
            (v) promote competitive private sector participation; and
            (vi) support the traditional agricultural sector downstream
            through the rational management of the Manantali reservoir.
            The project's components are as follows: 1) power
            station including civil works, electromechanical equipment,
            step-up substation, and reinforcement works; 2) transmission
            system comprising transmission lines and a dispatching
            center; 3) construction supervision; 4) institutional
            strengthening including studies, training, procurement of
            equipment and other support; and 5) Project Preparation
            Facility Advance refinancing.
