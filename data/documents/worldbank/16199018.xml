            Attracting FDI : how much does investment
            climate matter?
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Business opportunities-as reflected in
            the size and growth potential of markets-are the most
            powerful drivers of foreign direct investment. But
            investment climate features such as strong institutions and
            investor friendly regulations also matter and may even boost
            the development impact of the investment. Moreover, many
            elements of the investment climate can be reformed in the
            short run and at comparatively low cost. Improving the
            investment climate therefore offers an excellent opportunity
            for countries seeking to attract foreign direct investment.
