ROAD II PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
Loan and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower:         Republic of Poland&#13;
Beneficiary:      Ministry of Transport and Maritime Economy (MTME); and&#13;
General Directorate of Public Roads (GDDP)&#13;
Amount:           US$300 million equivalent in two Single Currency Loan (SCL) Tranches&#13;
of US$150,0 million and DEM270.4 million, respectively.&#13;
Terms:            15 years maturity including a 5-year grace period, at the Bank's LIBOR-&#13;
based floating interest rate.&#13;
Poverty Category:  Not Applicable&#13;
Project Objectives: The main objective of the proposed project is to support and speed up the&#13;
modernization of the road sector operation along the lines of environment&#13;
and traffic safety policies initiated by the Government under the Roads&#13;
Project, Loan 3564-POL. Specifically, the project would: (i) improve the&#13;
main national road network (highways, bridges, bypasses, intersections);&#13;
(ii) urgently reconstruct and repair flood-damaged high priority roads and&#13;
bridges; (iii) study and solve the rutting situation on the network; (iv)&#13;
promote the competitive capacity of domestic contractors through&#13;
improvement of their technical, managerial, and financial capacity; (v)&#13;
improve the road safety situation; (vi) adjust road user charges for&#13;
different vehicle types to cover the economic costs incurred by each type&#13;
of vehicle, and to achieve a well balanced combined transport&#13;
framework; and (vii) advise on the operation, management, and&#13;
administration of the road sector on road safety issues, and its&#13;
coordination with the National Traffic Police.&#13;
Description:      The project would be fully part of an ambitious 1996-2000 Road&#13;
Investment Program finalized by GDDP, to be implemented during 1998-&#13;
2002. Specifically it would include the following three main areas of&#13;
Policy, Institutional and Physical Investment:&#13;
1. POLICY: (i) adequate maintenance and strengthening of high priority&#13;
roads, including bridges, and winter maintenance, with adequate budgets;&#13;
(ii) review and adjustment of road user charge levels and distribution&#13;
between different user groups in order to achieve a reasonable balance&#13;
between costs and revenues; (iii) further action on the road axle-load&#13;
policy, initiated under the Roads project in consonance with that in&#13;
Western Europe; and (iv) establishment of a leasing policy to enhance&#13;
and speed up privatization of local contractors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2. INSTITUTIONAL: (i) further restructuring, privatization, and development of&#13;
the road contracting industry, focusing on the improvement of its&#13;
managerial, financial and technical capacity, and on the establishment of&#13;
professional associations to enhance their competitiveness; (ii)&#13;
improvement of the coordination, collaboration and operation of the&#13;
Agencies (Transport, GDDP, Ministry of Interior, National Police) on the&#13;
ongoing road safety program; and (iii) assistance to the vehicle&#13;
inspection center network as a part of road safety and environmental&#13;
measures.&#13;
3. PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE: part of the agreed GDDP 1996-2000 Road&#13;
Investment Program consisting of: (i) rehabilitation, upgrading,&#13;
realignment, and resurfacing of priority roads sections and their crossings&#13;
through cities; (ii) reconstruction and upgrading of 2 bridges, and&#13;
construction of 3 new major bridges; (iii) construction of 12 bypasses&#13;
around congested cities; (iv) emergency reconstruction of flood-damaged&#13;
high priority infrastructure (roads and bridges); (v) acquisition of road&#13;
maintenance equipment, vehicles and materials, and road safety&#13;
equipment, vehicles and materials; and (vi) technical assistance (TA) and&#13;
training for the ongoing road safety program, and in the fields of&#13;
management, planning, pavement and maintenance systems, protection&#13;
of the environment, modem design and construction techniques, and&#13;
further privatization of local consultants and contractors.&#13;
Benefits:          The project will reduce: (i) vehicle operating costs; (ii) future&#13;
reconstruction expenditures through timely and adequate maintenance;&#13;
(iii) road accidents; and (iv) construction costs by introducing the local&#13;
construction industry to open competitive bidding procedures. The ERR&#13;
from the civil works included in the project has been estimated at 25&#13;
percent.&#13;
Risks:             The main project risks are: (i) the availability of adequate local funds;&#13;
and (ii) the ability of the institutions to implement the project on time. In&#13;
order to reduce these risks, the GOP agreed at negotiations to: (i) budget&#13;
local costs (US$240.0 million equivalent) and, if the case arises, any cost&#13;
overrun; (ii) consult GDDP's budget with the Bank on an annual basis;&#13;
(iii) progressively increase GDDP maintenance budget in order to ensure&#13;
appropriate maintenance of the national road network; (iv) retain the&#13;
existing PMU for the project; (v) prepare first year's road/bridge/bypass&#13;
works program; and (vi) execute the Project Implementation Plan in&#13;
accordance with defined monitoring criteria, and reporting arrangements.&#13;

I. THE ECONOMY AND THE TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
A. Economy&#13;
1.01  Unparalleled by any other of the East European post-socialist economies, Poland has&#13;
entered its sixth consecutive year of fast economic growth (on average 6 percent in 1995-96).&#13;
Against a background of sound fiscal and monetary policies (the fiscal deficit averaged 2.6&#13;
percent of GDP in 1994-96), large internal and external imbalances have been avoided; this&#13;
contributed to a gradual, albeit persistent reduction of inflation to 18.5 percent in 1996. Sound&#13;
macroeconomic policies and continued structural reforms (although implemented at a slower&#13;
pace than in the early 1990s) have gained the confidence of foreign investors with capital inflows&#13;
representing over 2.1 percent of GDP in 1996. Sustained growth in the future will require&#13;
deepening the structural reform agenda, particularly in those areas which will help to consolidate&#13;
Poland's fiscal situation in preparation for European Union (EU) accession (pension reform, coal&#13;
sector reform, specialized banks restructuring, faster privatization, tax administration reform),&#13;
particularly, because of the stress that large investmenlt needs (for EU environmental compliance)&#13;
will place on the budget.&#13;
1.02 The recovery has been broad-based, and important gains in productivity have been registered&#13;
across sectors, with few (but significant) exceptions. Industrial production, led by strong growth in&#13;
manufacturing, has been steadily expanding for four years (1993-1996), and so have construction&#13;
and services (particularly in the private sector). Agriculture after being hit by a serious drought in&#13;
1994, recovered and is estimated to have grown by 9 percent in 1995, and 2.4 percent in 1996. The&#13;
dynamism in the economy was entirely attributable to the expansion in the private sector, which&#13;
grew at an estimated 15 percent annual pace in the industrial and service sectors. The economy has&#13;
benefited from the positive impact of the resurgence of growth in Western Europe. Moderate&#13;
average growth in the public sector reflects an overall good adaptation to the changing economic&#13;
environment, particularly hard budget constraints. However, the public sector continues to be&#13;
burdened with a number of large loss-making enterprises where restructuring, including further&#13;
downsizing of activities, is required (coal, steel, defense and railways). Recent July 1997 floods&#13;
have produced damages, preliminary assessed as 2 percent of GDP. This will represent an&#13;
additional constraint to the economy.&#13;
1.03 While on the supply-side the recovery has been broad-based, on the demand side there has&#13;
been a shift of pull factors from exports (in 1995) to domestic consumption (in 1996); investment&#13;
kept growing fast in both years (on average 24.5 percent growth). The external counterpart has&#13;
been a shift from a strong (and unsustainable) current account surplus in 1995 (3 percent of&#13;
GDP) to a small deficit in 1996 (1 percent of GDP). However, in view of strong capital inflows,&#13;
foreign reserves kept growing during 1996 by $3.3 billion (they increased $ 8.9 billion in 1995).&#13;
B. The Transport Sector&#13;
1.04  System and Infrastructure. Related to country area, 313,000 km2, and population, 39&#13;
million, transport densities are at an average European level. The system includes about (i) 372,479&#13;
km of roads (Table 2.1), of which more than 65 percent are paved (119 km/l00 kmn2; CEE: 128&#13;
km/lu 00 kin2), (ii) 24,000 km of railway lines (Annex 1.1), of which 48 percent are electrified (CEE:&#13;
38 percent on average), (iii) seven major ports with international traffic (Gdansk, Gdynia, Szczesin,&#13;

and Swinoujscie in the Baltic sea, and the river ports of Gliwice, Warsaw, and Wroclaw), (iv) 4,000&#13;
km of inland waterways, navigated by regular transport services, mainly on the Vistula (60 percent)&#13;
and Oder rivers connected by the Bydgoskim canal in north-central Poland, and (v) four airports&#13;
with scheduled international connections, as well as a large number (134) of domestic airports.&#13;
Poland has about 6,800 km of oil and gas pipeline.&#13;
1.05   Sector Transformations. The present situation in the sector is shaped by two main factors:&#13;
the legacy of the past and the ongoing restructuring of the economy. In Poland, as elsewhere in&#13;
Eastern Europe under the former (planned economy) system, there was a general lack of&#13;
competition, pricing was unimportant, and enterprises were vertically integrated, providing their&#13;
own technical and social services. There was a high degree of centralization in decision-making.&#13;
In transport this led to a small number of very large organizations, some with more than a hundred&#13;
thousand employees. A deep transformation of objectives, policies, structures and operations is&#13;
now underway to achieve important physical and institutional targets with due regard to quality,&#13;
financial and other efficiency criteria. At the same time, modernization of certain parts of the sector&#13;
and a strategic geographic redirection of traffic (from former Soviet Union countries to EU and&#13;
other Western countries), putting emphasis on closer integration with the economies of Western&#13;
Europe, are of high priority. Poland is expected to be in the first wave of former CEE countries to&#13;
become members of the EU.&#13;
1.06 Foreign Trade and Freight Traffic. During the last six years, Polish exports (mainly coal,&#13;
copper, sulfur, ships, foods and chemicals) reached a level in the range US$12.0 to 15.0 billion.&#13;
Exports grew 9.3 percent from 1995 to 1996. More progressive imports of goods (mainly: crude&#13;
oil, fertilizers, machinery and electric equipment) increased sharply and reached in 1996 nearly&#13;
US$16.0 billion, an increase of 120 percent compared with 1989 (and 29 percent from 1995 to&#13;
1996). For the coming period till year 2000, it can be expected that Polish exports will focus on&#13;
products which take advantage of its low labor costs, as in the textile and clothing industries. In the&#13;
event Poland becomes a full member of the European Union, export opportunities for agriculture&#13;
and the metallurgical industries could grow. This trend is likely to continue, gradually making the&#13;
distribution of freight traffic between rail and road traffic in Poland more similar to that in Western&#13;
Europe, where it is about 25/75. In Poland, reflecting the growing importance of road transport,&#13;
this ratio is currently 40/60.&#13;
1.07 Transport Sector Administration. The Ministry of Transport and Maritime Economy&#13;
(MTME) has overall responsibility for transport sector policy and infrastructure within the&#13;
government structure. The Ministry's responsibility covers road, rail, air and maritime and river&#13;
transport and infrastructure, plus some related activities, such as a few minor shipyards located&#13;
within the port areas. The legal arrangements and actual operating arrangements between the&#13;
Ministry and its department entities vary (Chart 1), covering the full range from fully autonomous&#13;
administrative agencies such as the General Directorate of Public Roads (GDDP - Generalna&#13;
Dyrekcja Drog Publicznych, Chart 2) to enterprises in which the Government retains control.&#13;
MTME's main functions are: (i) policy formulation of all aspects of transport, including safety and&#13;
environment; (ii) elaboration of sector budgets; (iii) allocation of budgetary subsidies between&#13;
subsectors and enterprises; (iv) overall supervision of entities such as Polish State Railways (PKP -&#13;
Polskie Koleje Panstwowe), GDDP, Bus Transport Company (PKS - Polska Komunikacja&#13;
Samochodowa) and Port Authorities; and (v) passenger tariff approval.&#13;

1.08 Sectoral Policy. The Transport Policy Paper issued by MTME in April 1996, and&#13;
subsequently approved by the Council of Ministers, spells out the priorities of the national transport&#13;
policy. The main priorities are to: (i) remove bottlenecks in the transport system; and (ii) achieve&#13;
high economic, social and environmental effects, so as to strengthen the competitiveness of Polish&#13;
Transport organizations, and hence of the national economy. The main issues still confronting the&#13;
transport sector are the restructuring of state-owned transport organizations and related employment&#13;
structure, competition and modernization, and tariffs and cost recovery. An additional unexpected&#13;
issue is the repair of the damages to transport infrastructure through the recent July 1997 floods.&#13;
1.09  Restructuring of state-owned Transport Organizations. The restructuring process has&#13;
been underway for several years already, and many new independent enterprises have been set up&#13;
out of former large state monopolies. The Bank's First Transport Project contributed to this&#13;
process, in railways (Loan 3194-POL) and roads (Loan 3193-POL). One common way of dealing&#13;
with public companies includes a two-step approach, whereby: (i) they were first converted&#13;
(commercialized) into joint-stock companies, the shares of which remain fully owned by the&#13;
Ministry of Treasury during a specified time period; and (ii) at the expiration of this transitory&#13;
phase, shares were to be sold in part or in full to internal and external investors. The second step of&#13;
this process has proven more difficult than the first, and reaching agreement on the conditions&#13;
under which investors will participate has not yet been fully achieved.&#13;
1.10  The five biggest road construction companies in Poland (GPRD Gdansk, Dromex, PPRM&#13;
Plock, KPRM Kielce and WPRD Warszawa) have been converted into joint-stock companies,&#13;
where less than 50 percent of the company value is owned by Government and the rest belongs to&#13;
employees. Furthermore, there are about 230 small construction companies in Poland, which were&#13;
converted into joint-stock companies as well, where more than 50 percent of the company is owned&#13;
by the Ministry of Treasury. The restructuring of the Bus Transport Company (PKS) resulted in the&#13;
emergence of 174 independent companies whose founding organ is the Ministry of Transport and&#13;
Maritime Economy. The privatization program of these companies is based on the model used in&#13;
the Czech Republic and Hungary.&#13;
1.11  In rail transport, PKP (Annex 1.1) is pursuing a restructuring program which separate train&#13;
operations organizationally from infrastructure and create separate lines of business (profit centers)&#13;
for freight and passengers, while preserving the integrity of the company as a whole. A law&#13;
restructuring PKP was passed in July 1995, stipulating that PKP should be organized along lines of&#13;
business, separating freight train operations, passenger train operations, rolling stock, and&#13;
infrastructure. The new organization is to be tested in PKP's Eastern Region during 1997 and to go&#13;
into effect nationally at the start of 1998. This may lead to privatization of several rolling stock&#13;
suppliers and specialized infrastructure companies, as well as non-transport enterprises which are&#13;
functioning within the present structure of the PKP. PKP would sell off unnecessary or obsolete&#13;
assets, as far as possible.  PKP restructuring in the short and medium  term  calls for&#13;
commercialization rather than wholesale privatization of the existing railways.&#13;
1.12 Polish Airlines (LOT; Polskie Linie Lotnicze) is the main Polish air carrier and is fully&#13;
owned by the State Treasury. In anticipation of the EU's policy of open skies among member&#13;
states, LOT is already commercialized and profitable. It is soon to sell shares to private investors&#13;
for the first time, and expects to strengthen its ties with a strategic partner, American Airlines (AA),&#13;

in order to improve its access to the American market and to AA's international ticket reservation&#13;
system. Traffic to its main markets of Germany and other EU destinations has been growing since&#13;
1993 at about 15 percent per year. LOT's fleet is exceptionally young as a result of the replacement&#13;
of its entire Soviet aircraft fleet in 1993 and 1994 with a fuel-efficient Boeing fleet. The new&#13;
airport in Warsaw, which has runway capacity for 10 million passengers per year, is somewhat&#13;
limited to the present 2.5 - 3.0 million passenger traffic by the capacity of the terminal building.&#13;
Demand is growing for investment in regional airports to bypass Warsaw.&#13;
1.13  The Baltic ports of Gdansk, Gdynia, and Szczecin-Swinoujscie handle 95 percent of Polish&#13;
maritime traffic (about 52 million tons in 1994). They have been restructured since late 1991 into&#13;
three joint-stock companies. Each Port Authority (PA) became independent of MTME moving&#13;
from operating companies under MTME to full-scale PAs. They have separated the operating units&#13;
from the management bodies, setting up private commercial companies. The new draft Port Law&#13;
would entrust the PAs with the authority to act as landlord ports, i.e., managing the public&#13;
infrastructure assets, while endorsing the commercial activities to separate private operations fully&#13;
independent from the PAs. In inland waterways transport the effects of restructuring have led to: (i)&#13;
3 enterprises are owned by voivodships; (ii) 3 companies have been commercialized; and (iii) 2&#13;
companies have been liquidated. River ports, as elements of the national infrastructure, are to be&#13;
transferred to the control of local government entities. Some of them are to be used by ship-owning&#13;
companies, others are to become the property of industrial firms. Inland waterways, because of&#13;
their attributes and strategic importance, are to remain state owned.&#13;
1.14 The modernization of the transport system also requires better coordination between the&#13;
different transport modes. Combined road-rail transport has already met with some success in&#13;
Poland, but the physical facilities need upgrading, and the organizational arrangements are not yet&#13;
optimal. The Bank's Roads Project (Loan 3564-POL) has begun addressing these issues through a&#13;
Pilot Program, still under preparation by the Polish Combined Transport Agency (POLKOMBI;&#13;
Polski Transport Kombinowany). Combined transport can also include a better use of the waterway&#13;
network.&#13;
1.15  Tariffs and Cost Recovery - Tariff controls have been abolished for freight transport both by&#13;
rail and by road. For passenger transport the railway tariffs are government controlled and about&#13;
two thirds of all passengers pay a reduced tariff (only about 30 percent of costs in 1993). This is&#13;
being changed gradually through sharply increased tariffs. While cross-subsidization from freight&#13;
to passenger services is substantial, it has diminished since PKP passenger fares increased in real&#13;
terms about 40 percent between 1993 and 1996. A contributing factor to the decrease in cross-&#13;
subsidies has been the cessation of low volume services, both in rail and road, and the transfer of&#13;
various PKP and PKS services to the private sector.&#13;
1.16  Present shortcomings of the Polish transport system include excessive employment levels in&#13;
some subsectors. Such a situation exists mainly in rail transport, but generally the employment&#13;
structure does not fit the requirements of a modern transport system. Differences with the&#13;
employment structure in the EU are highlighted in the following table:&#13;

1.17  Investments. A significant shortcoming of the sector in recent years has been the low level&#13;
of investment, from both public and private sources, compared with the total domestic investments.&#13;
In 1995 the total national transport investments amounted to only 5.25 percent of the total domestic&#13;
investments (Zl 3,068 million), even though transport assets accounted for 12.4 percent of the&#13;
country's national assets.  The following table illustrates the declining share of transport&#13;
investments in Poland since 1986:&#13;

C. Previous IBRD Involvement in the Transport Sector&#13;
1.18  The Bank has been involved in the sector since the late 80's. The ongoing First Transport&#13;
Project (Loan 3193-POL, US$4.8 for roads and Loan 3194-POL, $145.0 million for railways;&#13;
1991) aims to support the restructuring of the sector through developing more efficient internal&#13;
management systems and maintenance procedures, together with the required financing support.&#13;
This project has concentrated heavily on PKP, with a smaller component going to GDDP for the&#13;
establishment of a Pavement Management System (PMS; the base justification of every economic&#13;
investment in the road sector) which includes the supply of field measurement equipment and&#13;
computers as well as the supply of laboratory equipment for better on-site quality control of works.&#13;
The project progressed well, with policy reform and restructuring being implemented faster than&#13;
foreseen and with disbursements on schedule. The project was closed on December 31, 1996. An&#13;
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) is under preparation.&#13;
1.19 The Roads Project (Loan 3564-POL, US$150.0 million; 1993) aims to speed up the&#13;
modernization and transformation of the transport sector with special emphasis on the national road&#13;
network and its administration, GDDP, to help improve the road network, to continue the Bank's&#13;
support started under the first Transport Project for development of modern management tools in&#13;
GDDP, to introduce competitive bidding for road works and to improve the competitive capacity of&#13;
the local construction and consulting industry, and to initiate the development of modem combined&#13;
transport systems. The project is also implementing a comprehensive Road Safety Program in&#13;

the project has been satisfactorily disbursed and executed.&#13;
1.20  Lessons Learned.   Experience acquired in the preparation and implementation of the&#13;
above projects highlights the need to focus at an early stage on environmental issues to get timely&#13;
clearance from relevant authorities and avoid delays in project processing. The improvement in&#13;
public procurement regulations owes much to the Bank's efforts in this area, and it is expected that&#13;
the new procurement law recently enacted would make procurement management easier under the&#13;
proposed project. Other main lessons learned from these projects are the importance of: (i) keeping&#13;
the project objectives clear and simple in order to facilitate implementation and monitoring; (ii)&#13;
guaranteeing counterpart funds on time in order to avoid delays or even failures; and (iii) providing&#13;
advice on construction techniques to the domestic contractors to increase their competitiveness. All&#13;
these lessons have been taken into consideration in designing the proposed project.&#13;
II. ROADS&#13;
A. Road Network and Traffic&#13;
2.01  The national network (see map IBRD 28740 -Poland; and Table 2.1) consists mainly of&#13;
undivided 2-lane roads. There are about 1,216 km of four-lane divided highways, of which 252 km&#13;
are motorways with controlled access and grade separated intersections. In addition, there are 257&#13;
km of two-lane roads with restricted access (called expressways in Poland). The rest is made up of&#13;
two-lane roads with varying standards and conditions. Most of the road network consists of a 6 or&#13;
7 m single carriageway with or without hard shoulders. In light of the increasing traffic volumes,&#13;
the mixture of traffic found on Polish roads, and the fact that budget constraints have slowed down&#13;
road improvement efforts, certain road sections are experiencing increasing capacity and safety&#13;
problems, especially in areas close to urban or industrial centers, and the resurfacing cycle is&#13;
lengthening. Few major cities have bypasses, and in many urban areas, traffic capacity is&#13;
approaching its upper limit. New bypasses, and roads and railroad grade separations along these&#13;
roads, should eliminate point impediments to traffic-flow capacity. In selected locations, a second&#13;
carriageway is needed.&#13;
2.02 Almost the entire National Road Network (45,635 km, Table 2.1) is paved, along with 86&#13;
percent of voivodship roads and 43 percent of the local road network. This implies that 65 percent&#13;
(243,150 km) of the entire Polish network is paved. The 45,126 km under GDDP jurisdiction&#13;
constitute the National Road Network administered through a central administration in Warsaw and&#13;
seventeen regional administrations (DODP) to implement the investment and maintenance&#13;
activities (Chart 2). In April 1996 the Road Network Development Planning Office (BPRSD)&#13;
prepared a report on Pavement Technical Condition on the National Road Network based on the&#13;
measurements for the road strengthening and maintenance programs under the new Pavement&#13;
Management System (paras. 1. 18, and 2.08). According to this report, only about 27 percent of the&#13;
national road network (11,900 km) was in good condition, whereas 6,510 km require resurfacing,&#13;
10,540 km rehabilitation, and 13,920 km strengthening. As axle loads increase because of heavier&#13;
trade and traffic with the EU, this figure will rise. There are about 29,000 bridges located in&#13;
Poland, totaling some 520 km. Around 180 bridges are more than 200 m long. Some 45 km of&#13;
bridges are still wooden and 78 km do not meet current standards for clearance or loading. Repair&#13;

2.03 About 10,300 km of the National Road Network are being strengthened from a 8-ton to 10&#13;
ton single axle load standard and eventually to a 11.5-ton single axle load design. These are roads&#13;
carrying heavy international and inter-regional traffic, particularly traffic from the EU with 11.5-ton&#13;
standard single axle loads. To monitor this situation and provide data for policy change a network&#13;
of 24 fixed and 20 mobile weighing/counting/classifying stations was established by GDDP under&#13;
the First Transport and Roads projects. These data are being used under the proposed project. All&#13;
motorways and expressways are designed with 11.5-ton single axle-load pavements.&#13;
2.04 Traffic. Poland, as a country situated at the geographic center of Europe, provides the&#13;
logical land transport route between Western Europe and the vart markets in Russia, Ukraine,&#13;
Belarus and Lithuania. It also provides the transit route between northern European countries and&#13;
those of the Mediterranean basin. Rapid improvements to Poland's highway system are critical to&#13;
the future of this trans-European trade, as well as to the economic health of the country itself.&#13;
Traffic data are obtained through annual traffic counts and through a nationwide traffic census held&#13;
every five years (the last one in 1995). The average annual traffic growth in Poland over the past&#13;
few years has been 4.5-5.5 percent, resulting in heavy trafficked roads throughout the country's&#13;
road system (Annex 2.1). Annex 2.2 shows evolution of the road vehicle fleet.&#13;
2.05 The greatest increase in traffic volumes has taken place on the roads (4,000 kin) carrying&#13;
heavy international traffic, which has increased more than 100 percent since 1985 to 10,000&#13;
vehicles per day (vpd). Trafffic on the main roads (10,000 kin) has also grown by 80 percent since&#13;
1985 to about 6,000 vpd. The rest (about 31,000 km of the National Road Network) carries traffic&#13;
under 2,000 vpd. Problems are particularly acute at the international border crossings. More than&#13;
150 million people crossed the country's border with Germany last year, 50 percent more than&#13;
projected for the year 2005. Congestion is so great that heavy-truck border crossing can sometimes&#13;
take a day or even longer. Therefore one critical element calls for upgrading Poland's border&#13;
crossings and improving the customs procedures at crossings on the main roads systems. This&#13;
includes work on 18 border crossings to Germany; 22 border crossings to the Czech and Slovak&#13;
republics; 18 border crossings to Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania and Russia; and three Baltic Sea&#13;

ports. Presently, Poland has a program of modernization of access roads to the border-crossings&#13;
financed from national funds and PHARE funds. Modernization of port access is designed in the&#13;
Bank Port Access and Management Project (Loan 4080-0 and 4080-1 POL). This situation is&#13;
also taken into consideration in the design of road works under the proposed project.&#13;
B. Administration and Organization&#13;
2.06 National roads are administered by GDDP. The organization consist of a central&#13;
administration in Warsaw and 17 regional administrations (DODP) to implement the investment&#13;
and maintenance activities. Each of the DODP is defined geographically, and comprises one or&#13;
more of the 49 nationwide voivodships. The local administration and execution of DODP's&#13;
activities is carried out by district road units of which there are a total of 171. The voivodship also&#13;
use the services of the DODPs for maintenance and construction works on major rural voivodship&#13;
roads and then compensate GDDP from their own budgets. GDDP involvement is thus greater than&#13;
indicated by the length of the National Road Network. Roads and streets in certain major urban&#13;
areas, which are not a part of the state or voivodship networks, are administrated by city councils.&#13;
2.07 Before 1991, Poland's road and bridge construction industry consisted of nine major&#13;
national enterprises together with a network of smaller enterprises, which were part of the 17&#13;
DODPs. At each DODP, there were usually three or four road construction enterprises and one&#13;
bridge enterprise, which executed contracts according to negotiated unit rates, although in practice&#13;
most rates were taken from a public list. In 1991, all 238 enterprises formerly part of and within the&#13;
structure of GDDP were transformed into enterprises to be developed with full independence from&#13;
GDDP. The enterprises are therefore fully commercialized and will be progressively privatized.&#13;
Thus, no salaries are being paid by GDDP, and all are dependent on winning contracts, for which&#13;
they are free to bid anywhere in Poland. Assistance to the enterprises has been and is being&#13;
provided under the Privatization and Restructuring Project, and also through specific execution of&#13;
contracts and TA and training under the Roads project, and further on under the proposed project.&#13;
Creation of joint ventures with foreign firms, and subsequent partial or total privatization, is taking&#13;
place particularly among the largest firms. The proposed project would promote the establishment&#13;
of professional associations to enhance the enterprises' competitiveness (para. 3.04). The changes&#13;
in GDDP staff since the change to the free market economy system are as follows:&#13;

C. Planning, Execution and Supervision&#13;
2.08 Highway sector policy in Poland is set by MTME, which in 1993 promulgated a Statement&#13;
of Aims and Intentions (Annex 2.3). The objectives of the proposed project are guided by this&#13;
statement, which pledges the Government's best efforts, inter alia, to arrest the decline of the&#13;
maintenance budget and to increase road user charges to promote a fuller shouldering of the&#13;
financing burden by the road user, to introduce economic evaluation as a criterion in investment&#13;
project selection, and to improve road safety. The statement also promises to give priority to&#13;
maintenance, strengthening, and modernization, over new construction. The task of translating&#13;
policy into planning is the responsibility of the Road Network Development Office (BPRSD -&#13;
Biuro Planovania Rozwoju Sieci Drogowej), which is in permanent contact with the Road and&#13;
Bridge Research Institute (IBDiM - Institut Badawczy Drog i Mostow) for the latest technical&#13;
developments. It functions as GDDP's planning department, and has a staff of about 70, consisting&#13;
mostly of engineers, economists and planners. It has good contacts with the DODPs and a&#13;
reasonable database is maintained on road conditions, bearing capacity, traffic, and accidents&#13;
through contacts with other agencies and institutes. The development and establishment of a&#13;
Pavement Management System (PMS), under the First Transport Project, has considerably&#13;
enhanced planning capacity, facilitating the economic justification of every investment.&#13;
2.09  Annex 2.4 details the set of geometric standards applied by GDDP in its road network.&#13;
Construction is carried out by contractors who have been awarded contracts on a competitive basis,&#13;
as introduced under the Roads project. Supervision is provided monthly by DODP's staff,&#13;
sometimes by new private consultants, with some shortcomings in laboratory facilities which are&#13;
being addressed under the proposed project. All operations of routine maintenance, including&#13;
winter maintenance, are directly executed and supervised by the respective DODP. Although the&#13;
professional skills are available for developing a national (construction and maintenance) road plan,&#13;
this has been hampered by the unpredictability and sharp reduction of the road budgets during&#13;
recent years (para. 2.10). A recently enacted law is aimed to the solution of this budgetary issue&#13;
(para 2.1 1).&#13;
D. Road Financing and Expenditures&#13;
2.10  Road Financing. The public roads are financed from the central budget and GDDP has the&#13;
responsibility to plan, supervise and provide funds for construction and maintenance of the public&#13;
road network. Table 2.3 shows the development of funds in real terms (1989-1996) and forecast for&#13;
1997:&#13;

The total level of funds available for national roads has declined during the past 10 years.&#13;
Expenditures in 1993 only amounted to about 39 percent of the 1989 expenditure level, but in 1997&#13;
allocated budget, in real terms, amounts to 70 percent of the 1989 expenditure level. Since then,&#13;
despite the improvement of the situation, a lot remains to be done. For periodic road maintenance,&#13;
GDDP is expected to spend around US$197.0 million (and US$194.5 million on routine&#13;
maintenance) on the National Roads Network in 1997.&#13;

2.11 The trend in maintenance expenditure is improving but is still of special concern. There is&#13;
no doubt that there is an urgent need to secure increased funds for maintenance activities, not only&#13;
to be able to restore roads that have already deteriorated, but also to prevent further deterioration of&#13;
roads presently in good condition. If budgets are not increased, structural deterioration will take&#13;
place which in the long term will require funds substantially higher than levels needed today. It is&#13;
estimated that the long term average need for merely maintaining the existing national road network&#13;
(42,500 km), excluding expenditures on administration, is US$450 million per year, i.e., 15 percent&#13;
more than the 1997 budget. This is based on the findings of a study of the Polish National Road&#13;
Network carried out by the Danish Road Directorate in 1992, and it agrees with the findings of&#13;
BPRSD's own recent study under the PMS. Of this amount, about half should be allocated to&#13;
current road maintenance, a third to rehabilitation, about 10 percent to winter maintenance and&#13;
roughly 10 percent to bridge maintenance and rehabilitation. Although these figures are subject to&#13;
some degree of uncertainty because unit price levels have not yet stabilized, they reflect a&#13;
consensus of various approaches and professional opinions on maintenance of the National Road&#13;
Network. A new law, the Road Funding Law of August 29, 1997, will (starting on January 1,&#13;
1998) earmark 30 percent of excise taxes on fuel for the National and Voivodship Road Network&#13;
permitting a progressive solution of this budgetary issue. During negotiations, agreement was&#13;
reached with the GOP on a progressive increase of the GDDP budget, through the Road&#13;
Funding Law of August 29, 1997, in accordance to the economically and technically&#13;
appropriate maintenance needs in real terms per year.&#13;
E. Taxation and Road User Charges&#13;
2.12  Road users in Poland pay various taxes associated with road use. The revenues directly&#13;
linked to road use and vehicle operations are:&#13;
- turnover tax on vehicles;&#13;
- vehicle registration fees;&#13;
- drivers licensing fees;&#13;
- fuel taxes; and&#13;
- fees from international road transport concessions.&#13;
All revenues from these sources go to the state budget except the registration fees and vehicle driver&#13;
licensing fees, which are levied by the local authorities (voivodships). The total 1996 revenue to&#13;
the state budget amounted to about US$2.500 million. Around a quarter (25 percent) of this&#13;
amount is allocated to the road sector.&#13;
2.13 Taxation. More than 90 percent of the road user taxation comes from the fuel tax. The&#13;
retail prices are shown below:&#13;

The tax share (70 percent) amounts to about half of the average Western European structure with&#13;
tax rates of around 140 percent. Although prices are lower than in Western Europe, they are well&#13;
above border prices. During the last 5 years, the government has consistently been raising the taxes&#13;
on vehicle fuels towards West European levels, in accordance with Bank advice. In February 1997,&#13;
the government has introduced market prices for fuel all over Poland. The new Road Funding Law&#13;
concerming financing of the public roads will become effective on January 1, 1998 and will earmark&#13;
30 percent of excise taxes on fuel for the National and Voivodship Road Network (para. 2.11).&#13;
Furthermore, in order to fulfill one of the conditions of its accession to the European Union, Poland&#13;
is willing to increase the fuel tax up to the level of EU members. This will increase the level of the&#13;
budget allocated to the public roads by 20 percent yearly, and will double the present budget within&#13;
five years.&#13;
2.14 System of Road User Charges. Economic efficiency is maximized when road user&#13;
charges cover road maintenance and investment expenditures, and each vehicle class covers at&#13;
least its variable road costs. The optimum maintenance expenditure is that which minimizes the&#13;
discounted sum of road costs and vehicle operating costs. Separate estimates are made for each&#13;
vehicle class and road surface, for the main national road (GDDP) network, local road network&#13;
and urban streets.&#13;
2.15 There are three conditions which must be taken into account in assessing the system of&#13;
road user charges in Poland. First, the Government, following the transition, uses the fuel tax as&#13;
a major source of general revenue because it is easy to collect, impacts the wealthy more than the&#13;
poor, and because this is common practice in most European countries. The retail price of&#13;
normal gasoline in Poland (US$0.50-0.53 equivalent per liter, Table 2.4) ranks 24th among 35&#13;
representative European countries, while diesel fuel (US$0.40 equivalent per liter) ranks 25th.&#13;
Second, the national road network is mostly in poor or fair condition (para. 2.02), requiring&#13;
rehabilitation before it is capable of being maintained (particularly periodic maintenance). The&#13;
PMS (following Bank HDM III), on the other hand, assumes that the road network is in&#13;
sufficiently good condition that it can be maintained through normal maintenance procedures.&#13;
Third, a significant part of the local rural road network was built by cooperatives which now&#13;
have disappeared. Many of these roads are not maintained, and part of them may be abandoned&#13;
in the future. Under these circumstances, the PMS model is most useful in indicating the funds&#13;
which would be needed to maintain the main rural network (and urban network) after most roads&#13;
have been rehabilitated, which will take a number of years.&#13;

F. Traffic Safety&#13;
2.16  The number of road accidents in Poland is very high; some 57,911 accidents with 6,359&#13;
fatalities and 71,419 serious injuries were recorded in 1996 (Annex 2.5). The economic cost of this&#13;
human tragedy is also high, amounting to 7 percent of the state budget and 2 percent of the GDP&#13;
(ZI 7.5 billion, or US$2.5 billion). This rate is quite disproportionate with the country's volume of&#13;
traffic, putting Poland among the worst performers with respect to road safety in Europe. About 13&#13;
fatalities occurred per 100 road accidents while the European Union average is slightly over 3.&#13;
Usually, the following are found to be the main causes of the high severity indicators in Poland:&#13;
* speeding;&#13;
* consumption of alcohol;&#13;
* poor drivers' training;&#13;
* poor construction of some type of cars that are numerous on Polish roads;&#13;
* black spots and hostile surrounding of the road (trees, poles without protective barriers);&#13;
* low level of traffic law enforcement;&#13;
* a long period of time elapses from the moment of the accident until rescue and&#13;
medical services arrive.&#13;
The Road Safety Program (GAMBIT), implementation of which is included under the proposed&#13;
project (para. 3.12) takes into consideration improvement of these important aspects of road safety.&#13;
2.17  Before the Bank's involvement in the transport sector, there were few administrative&#13;
entities involved in road safety in Poland, lacking coordination among themselves and with no&#13;
authority responsible for an overall approach to road safety; each entity only dealt with part of the&#13;
problem. There was no road accident prevention plan. Under this situation, there were two&#13;
administrative changes which were prerequisites for effective action to improve road safety: (a) the&#13;
creation of a supra-ministerial National Road Safety Council responsible for road safety policy; and&#13;
(b) a Road Safety Unit, led by a Road Safety Coordinator within the MTIE in charge of and&#13;
responsible for developing, supervising and coordinating government policy and for establishing&#13;
administrative and coordinating structures. The Government was aware of the problem and had&#13;
indicated its willingness to proceed along the lines recommended by a Bank/EU Road Safety Study&#13;
in the Roads Project. Through Resolution 92/93 of the Cabinet dated Oct. 21, 1993, the&#13;
Government has established the National Road Safety Council, chaired by the Deputy Prime&#13;
Minister (Chart 3). Its establishment, with the collaboration of the Road Safety Unit (June 1994) in&#13;
MTME, has been a landmark in the development of road safety measures. Road Safety Councils&#13;
have been appointed by all voivodships. The use of seat belts is now compulsory, as is the use of&#13;
daytime running lights in winter. The Council has also generated guidelines (Traffic Code, will&#13;
become effective in January 1, 1998) for the operation of the traffic police. The speed limit in built-&#13;
up areas would be lowered to 50 km/h and an improvement of the license points system is&#13;
underway. The sharp decrease in the number of fatalities (6,359 in 1996 compared to 6,900 in&#13;
1995) is a result of the actions taken. However, lack of funding for the numerous agencies involved&#13;
- including the National Council itself and the poorly equipped National Traffic Police - has&#13;
prevented a more efficient enforcement of regulations and achievement of desired goals on the&#13;
reduction of accidents and fatalities to a western European level. Further action is required through&#13;
TA and training, the procurement of road safety equipment for the Police, and adequate prevention&#13;

G. Environmental Aspects&#13;
2.18  Poland suffered from the environmental negligence under the central planning system's&#13;
emphasis on development of heavy industry and construction. After the changes at the end of the&#13;
1980's, the significant damage inflicted on water, air, and soil over the last 40 years became&#13;
evident. This damage was mostly concentrated in the Upper Silesia and Krakow region. In&#13;
addition, three ecological disaster zones in other parts of the country were identified by the&#13;
Government. An additional environmental problem is the contamination caused by the Soviet&#13;
military installations, which were returned to Poland in 1991. Over the past seven years,&#13;
considerable environmental improvements were achieved through new environmental policies,&#13;
but also through the decline of heavy industries, which were and are the major reason for the&#13;
environmental problems of the country.&#13;
2.19  One reason for the improvement in the environmental sphere is the strengthening of the&#13;
Ministry of Environmental Protection and National Resources, which was founded, as one of the&#13;
first Ministries of Envirom-nent in Central and Eastern Europe, in 1985. In the 1990s, the&#13;
Ministry as well as regional authorities were supported by international donors like the European&#13;
Union (EU) and also by a loan from the World Bank. Under the leadership of the Ministry,&#13;
Poland wants to legally adopt EU environmental standards before the end of the decade and&#13;
implement them within the next 10 years. The Ministry is starting to recognize the important&#13;
role of non governmental organizations (NGOs) in environmental policy making, and follows the&#13;
environmental regulations on road works established under ongoing Bank projects.&#13;
2.20  The Ministry, as in other sectors, has established strict and adequate procedures for&#13;
reviewing the environmental impact of the transport sector projects, in general, and of the highway&#13;
projects, in particular. The legislation establishes levels of review appropriate to the class of work&#13;
proposed, ranging from a review of the design and drawings for rehabilitation works to a full&#13;
Environmental Assessment (EA) Study for works developing through new alignments as the case&#13;
of bypasses and new bridges (paras. 3.34 through 3.36, and Annex 3.12). In fact, the environmental&#13;
requirements - which usually are enforced and controlled by the voivodships during construction -&#13;
are very similar to those required by the Bank and will not present any special obstacle for the&#13;
numerous works under the proposed Roads II project. Furthermore, the proposed project provides&#13;
an opportunity for the Government to integrate its environmental concerns into reality and to&#13;
develop and update its environmental system into sustainable development.&#13;
III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Background and Objectives&#13;
3.01 Background. Strong growth in road transport in Poland (34 percent increase in number of&#13;
registered vehicles during the last five years; para. 2.04, and Annex 2.2), and a deficient&#13;
institutional, managerial and budgetary response to this growth have created key infrastructure&#13;
bottlenecks. This situation has increased road deterioration and restricts development. Even&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
SAR                                                           Roads II Project, Poland&#13;
more, traffic accidents continue being a serious problem, and road safety and environmental&#13;
issues may become an additional problem if not anticipated in time (para. 2.16 and 2.17) because&#13;
of the fleet expansion and the upgrading works required on the infrastructure. To address these&#13;
problems, Poland has implemented a two-pronged highway-improvement strategy. The first&#13;
phase, to provide immediate relief at a relatively low cost, is a 1993-2010 program to improve&#13;
some 3,000 km of Poland's existing national roads system. It would cost an estimated US$1.5&#13;
billion and would upgrade portions of the existing national roads system into high-capacity, two-&#13;
lane highways. Phase two calls for construction of a system (2,600 km) of new four-laned,&#13;
limited-access toll motorways, called the Autostrada system, which will form the backbone of&#13;
Poland's portion of the trans-European road network. This system would be funded almost&#13;
exclusively by build-operate-transfer (BOT) concessional financing.&#13;
3.02 The proposed project, which is part of the first phase of the above strategy, would foster a&#13;
national institutional and managerial improvement of the road sector. It would also continue and&#13;
complement the ongoing institutional and physical improvements under the Bank's First&#13;
Transport and Roads projects (paras. 1.18 and 1.19), and the planned partial rehabilitation of the&#13;
main road network. Furthermore, in order to resume operation of major road network affected by&#13;
recent floods in north, west and south of Poland, the project will also include an emergency road&#13;
and bridge reconstruction subcomponent.&#13;
3.03  Objectives.  The main objective of the proposed project is to support and speed up the&#13;
modernization of the road sector along the lines of the enviromnental and traffic safety policy&#13;
initiated by the Government under the Roads Project. In particular, the project would:&#13;
(i)  improve the priority national road network sections with traffic volumes of at&#13;
least 6,000 veh./day;&#13;
(ii)  reconstruct and repair high priority flood-damaged roads and bridges;&#13;
(iii)  study and solve the rutting situation on the network;&#13;
(iv)  promote the competitive capacity of domestic contractors through&#13;
improvement of their technical, managerial, and financial capacity;&#13;
(v)  improve the road safety situation;&#13;
(vi)  adjust road user charges for different vehicle types to cover the economic&#13;
costs incurred by each type of vehicle, and to achieve a well balanced&#13;
combined transport framework; and&#13;
(vii)  advise on the operation, management, and administration of road safety&#13;
and its coordination with the National Police.&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
3.04. Project Composition. The project components would cover the three main areas (policy,&#13;
institutional, and physical investments) of the GDDP's 1996-2000 Road Investment Program (RIP),&#13;
as agreed and detailed under Government Decision 16/96 of July 15, 1996 as follows:&#13;
i. POLICY: (i) adequate maintenance and strengthening of high priority roads, including bridges,&#13;
and winter maintenance, with adequate budgets; (ii) review and adjustment of road user charge&#13;
levels and distribution between different user groups in order to achieve a reasonable balance&#13;

between costs and revenues; (iii) further action on the road axle-load policy, initiated under the&#13;
Roads project in consonance with that in Western Europe; and (iv) establishment of a leasing&#13;
policy to enhance and speed up privatization of local contractors.&#13;
2. INSTITUTIONAL: (i) further restructuring, privatization, and development of the road contracting&#13;
industry, focusing on the improvement of its managerial, financial and technical capacity, and on&#13;
the establishment of professional associations to enhance their competitiveness; (ii) improvement&#13;
of the coordination, collaboration and operation of the Agencies (Transport, GDDP, Ministry of&#13;
Interior, National Police) on the ongoing road safety program; and (iii) assistance to the vehicle&#13;
inspection center network as a part of road safety and environmental measures.&#13;
3. PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE: part of the agreed GDDP 1996-2000 Road Investment Program&#13;
consisting of: (i) rehabilitation, upgrading, realignment, and resurfacing of priority road sections&#13;
and their crossings through cities; (ii) reconstruction and upgrading of 2 bridges, and&#13;
construction of 3 new major bridges; (iii) construction of 12 bypasses around congested cities;&#13;
(iv) emergency reconstruction of flood-damaged high priority infrastructure (roads and bridges);&#13;
(v) acquisition of road maintenance equipment, vehicles and materials and road safety&#13;
equipment, vehicles and materials; and (vi) technical assistance (TA) and training for the&#13;
ongoing road safety program, in the fields of management, planning, pavement and maintenance&#13;
systems, protection of the environment, modern design and construction techniques, and further&#13;
privatization of local consultants and contractors.&#13;
3.05 Rehabilitation, upgrading, realignment, and resurfacing of priority road sections.&#13;
This component includes 522 km of road works, divided into four groups totaling 42 separate&#13;
contracts to be bid in late-1997, -1998, -1999, and -2000. Selection was based on economic&#13;
criteria, requiring a minimum ERR of 12 percent (the opportunity cost of capital in Poland), and&#13;
on traffic criteria, requiring about 6,000 vpd minimum, provided that other criteria regarding the&#13;
policy component statement and the environment and road safety requirements were met. Key&#13;
sections of principal national roads will be strengthened or improved, by pavement reinforcement&#13;
and asphalt concrete overlays, with associated widening or shoulder improvement where&#13;
justified, and in certain cases, bypassing congested urban areas. Elimination of accident black&#13;
spots, and difficult passages through towns will be included. Annex 3.1* shows the GDDP's list&#13;
of four groups of proposed selected tasks for the 1998-2002 execution period with estimated&#13;
economic rates of return (ERR), number of vehicles per day (vpd), type of works, estimated cost&#13;
(prices of September 1997), and localization by DODP. Annex 3.2  includes a list of reserve&#13;
tasks, to be executed in the event some savings and/or unexpected situations occur. GDDP has&#13;
been developing its capacity for economic, environmental and safety analysis of projects,&#13;
adapting its methods to the Bank's requirements. The procedures, presentation and the first&#13;
year's program (including bridge and bypasses, Group I, Annex 3.1) and the timing of&#13;
bidding was discussed and agreed during negotiations. The following years' programs will&#13;
be agreed on during the annual budget reviews.&#13;
*&#13;
This Annex includes also proposed tasks of rehabilitation and construction of bypasses and bridges.&#13;

3.06  Bridges. There is a serious backlog of major bridges repairs due to poor quality materials&#13;
used in the original construction and, often, because of the age of the structure. The project will&#13;
include the reconstruction of two high priority bridges, and construction of three new permanent&#13;
structures. Initial selection was discussed and decided using GDDP's bridge management&#13;
system, with final selection based on danger of collapse or closure, lengths of detours to next&#13;
crossing points, load restrictions, traffic levels, and percentage of heavy vehicles. An Executive&#13;
Summary of Environmental Impact Assessment was prepared and approved for every bridge&#13;
demonstrating the advantages of the construction and including all measures required to integrate&#13;
any environmental impacts. An ERR was calculated for each bridge, and selection was done on&#13;
the basis of a minimal ERR of 12 percent.&#13;
3.07  Bypasses.  In order to eliminate congestion in urban areas, the project will include&#13;
construction of twelve new bypasses (61.7 km long). Similarly to the selection process for&#13;
rehabilitation of roads, selection was based on economic criteria, requiring a minimum ERR of&#13;
12 percent, and on traffic criteria requiring more than 10,000 vpd. As in the case of new bridges,&#13;
every bypass was subject to a comprehensive and exhaustive Environmental Impact Assessment&#13;
study to be reviewed and approved by the Government and the Bank. Each study identifies and&#13;
analyzes the environmental and road safety impact of the bypass on the related urban area, and it&#13;
includes the measures required to appropriately mitigate any adverse environmental and road&#13;
safety impact.&#13;
3.08 Emergency reconstruction and repair of flood-damaged high priority roads and&#13;
bridges. The proposed project include those sections of priority roads, their retaining walls, and&#13;
slopes where mostly a minimal to medium level design work is required. The total length of&#13;
road sections to be reconstructed is approximately 300 km, consisting of 61 contracts. Selection&#13;
was based on criteria of priority and the proposed selection program will be subject to detailed&#13;
review with consequent possible revisions.&#13;
3.09 About 1.6 km of flood-damaged concrete and steel/concrete bridges (consisting of 18&#13;
contracts) are included for emergency reconstruction or repair under this subcomponent. For the&#13;
most part, bridges will be reconstructed similar to the original bridge designs, provided that&#13;
initial standards and construction process were adequate. List of the roads sections and bridges to&#13;
be repaired under this emergency subcomponent of the proposed project is shown in Annex 3.3.&#13;
3.10  Supervision of Works. Supervision of the above civil works contracts (rehabilitation&#13;
and reconstruction of roads, bridges and bypasses) would be carried out mostly by competent&#13;
GDDP staff teams financed under the GDDP recurrent budget. In specific cases, where external&#13;
consultants might be required, financing of their services would be under the TA and Training&#13;
component of the project.&#13;
3.11 Road Maintenance Equipment, Vehicles and Materials. Small quantities of road&#13;
maintenance equipment and materials are already being provided under the ongoing Roads&#13;
project. However, the scarcity of the maintenance budget (para 2.11) requires the additional&#13;
provision of maintenance equipment - and also materials - on a continuous and progressive basis.&#13;
Particularly important is the provision of winter maintenance equipment to prevent or to repair&#13;
the heavy damage inflicted on the roads by the severe Polish winters. A list of maintenance&#13;

equipment, vehicles, and materials, and related estimated costs (total cost US$12.8 million,&#13;
excluding contingencies) is included in Annex 3.4.&#13;
3.12 Road Safety Equipment, Vehicles and Materials. Road safety equipment (mostly&#13;
computer equipment) is already being provided under the Roads Project (Loan 3564-POL), as part&#13;
of the comprehensive Road Safety Program in close collaboration with the Ministry of Interior and&#13;
Administration, and the National Police. However, implementation of the nationwide Road Safety&#13;
Program known as GAMBIT requires further strict action on the procurement of road safety&#13;
equipment, vehicles and materials for the Police, on the educational aspects of pedestrians and&#13;
drivers, on the adequate preventive signalization, and on the elimination of individual black spots.&#13;
The project will include funding of road safety equipment, vehicles, and materials (US$12.7&#13;
million equivalent, excluding contingencies). A list of Road Safety equipment, vehicles and&#13;
materials to be acquired and related estimated costs is shown in Annex 3.5.&#13;
3.13  Technical Assistance (TA) and Training.  Besides the technical assistance provided&#13;
under the Roads Project (Loan 3564-POL), an important and extensive program of TA and training&#13;
for MTME, GDDP, DODPs, and the National Police is required on road maintenance, privatization&#13;
of the management, construction, and design methods, modernization of the construction and&#13;
consulting industries, and the Road Safety Program. Most TA and training would be provided in&#13;
the Jozefow Training Center (near Warsaw), established under the Bank Roads Project and opened&#13;
in December 1996. A list of the different TA and Training services to be provided under the project&#13;
and related costs (total cost US$1.7 million, excluding contingencies) is shown in Annex 3.6.&#13;
Under this category, the project would also finance the Road User Charges Study. The Study&#13;
would review and adjust the different categories of charges for every vehicle using the road, and&#13;
would recommend to establish a balanced share between cost (road damage) and revenues (road&#13;
charges) for every type of road user. The TOR for the Road User Charges Study are given in&#13;
Annex 3.7.&#13;
C. Design and Engineering&#13;
3.14 Management of the modernization program is being coordinated by the BPRSD, the&#13;
DODPs, and local consultants selected through procedures consistent with Bank Guidelines.&#13;
Designs are prepared from project dossiers drawn up by BPRSD and the respective DODP, and&#13;
follow GDDP's geometric standards, as shown in Annex 2.4. These are close to Western European&#13;
standards, and no significant benefit would be obtained by changing them. Pavement thickness&#13;
design is similar to what is used in France, with the procedure being revised to include actual axle&#13;
loads using data provided from the new weighing stations. The Road and Bridge Research Institute&#13;
(IBDiM) has generously collaborated with GDDP and the BPRSD in cases of some design&#13;
difficulties, particularly in bridges, and when specific research, mainly on pavements, was required&#13;
for the preparation of the project. It is expected that this relationship will continue.&#13;
D. Cost Estimates&#13;
3.15  The estimated total cost of the project, including taxes and duties, and physical and price&#13;
contingencies, amounts to US$540.0 million equivalent, with a foreign component of about&#13;
US$281.1 million equivalent or 52 percent of the total project cost. Cost estimates were&#13;

are based on quantities from advanced engineering designs prepared from project dossiers drawn&#13;
up by BPRSD, and estimates of September 1997 unit costs. The foreign component is estimated&#13;
from a breakdown of cost elements. Costs of road maintenance and safety equipment and&#13;
materials (US$25.5 million, excluding contingencies) are based on the latest and most recent&#13;
acquisitions under the Roads Project, and on similar deliveries in the ECA region. The cost of&#13;
the TA and training program on road maintenance, modernization of the management,&#13;
construction, and design methods, modernization of the construction and consulting industries, and&#13;
Road Safety Program (US$1.7 million, excluding contingencies) are based on ongoing&#13;
experience. TA by expatriate consultants for a total of 50 man-month (m/in) has been estimated&#13;
on the basis of US$20,000 per mn/m, all inclusive. The time-based rate for consultants, i.e., the&#13;
man-month, includes salary, social costs, firm's overhead, travel costs, fee or profit, and overseas&#13;
allowances. Training has been estimated on the basis of 170 rn/i and US$4,000 per rn/in, taking&#13;
into account that most training would be inside Europe. The composition of the project and&#13;

related costs, including TA and Training services, were discussed and agreed during&#13;
negotiations. All technical assistance, and training are exempted from taxes and duties.&#13;
3.17   A physical contingency of 10 percent has been included for all components, to cover a&#13;
possible increase in quantities. This amount is appropriate given the precise engineering designs&#13;
already available for the road works. Price contingencies have been applied to base cost plus&#13;
physical contingencies, expressed in US$ equivalent, in accordance with Bank guidelines.&#13;
E. Project Financing&#13;
3.18 The Borrower would be the Republic of Poland. The proposed Bank loan of US$300.0&#13;
million equivalent would finance 60 percent of the roads, bypasses, and bridges rehabilitation,&#13;
reconstruction and construction works costs (estimated foreign exchange cost: 50 percent), and&#13;
80 percent of the flood-related emergency rehabilitation of the roads and bridges works costs&#13;
(estimated foreign exchange cost: 60 percent). It would also finance 100 percent of the foreign&#13;
cost of the acquisition of equipment, vehicles, and materials for road maintenance and road&#13;
safety, and 100 percent of the total cost of training and consulting services. The Government's&#13;
contribution to the cost of the project, estimated at about US$240.0 million equivalent, would be&#13;
provided through GDDP's budget. The Government confirmed at negotiations that it would&#13;
meet these US$240.0 million equivalent local costs as well as, if the case arises, any cost&#13;
overrun. A financing plan, based on the above assumptions, is shown in Table 3.2 below.&#13;

SAR                                                           Roads II Project. Poland&#13;
F. Implementation and Monitoring&#13;
3.19 The existing Project Monitoring Unit (PMU) set up in MTME under the First Transport&#13;
Project and presently successfully completing the implementation of the Roads Project, will act&#13;
with responsibility for overall project management and coordination in close cooperation with&#13;
the Coordinating Unit established in GDDP. MTME and GDDP have developed significant&#13;
capacity in prequalification, bidding, contract documents and management, in cash flow&#13;
calculations and payments, and with the advice of the two roving resident (engineer and financial&#13;
analyst) advisers, presently working under the Roads Project, will be capable of successfully&#13;
implementing the proposed project. GDDP with the same project Coordinator as under the&#13;
Roads project and through the respective DODPs, will manage the road, bypasses, and bridges&#13;
works program, the emergency works program, its TA and training programs, and procurement&#13;
of road maintenance equipment, vehicles and materials. The PMU would be directly responsible&#13;
for all procurement required by the different agencies, mainly but not only the National Police,&#13;
and the procurement of all items required under the Road Safety (GAMBIT) program. It would&#13;
also coordinate with the National Road Safety Council and execute any decision related to the&#13;
Road Safety Program. The 59 road and bridge works contracts, assembled into four groups&#13;
(Annex 3.1), will be carried out over a five-year period, beginning in 1998. Annex 3.2 includes a&#13;
list of reserved tasks in case of unexpected savings or other justified reasons, for additional&#13;
investments. Each contract will include a one-year guarantee maintenance period following&#13;
completion. The 61 emergency repair road and bridge works contracts (Annex 3.3), along with&#13;
the group of small works, will be carried out over a three-year period, beginning in October&#13;
1997. Acquisition of equipment, vehicles and materials for road maintenance, road safety and&#13;
road signalization (during the first two years of the project implementation period), together with&#13;
selection of experts for TA and training programs for GDDP, DODPs and National Police&#13;
executive staff (through the entire five-year project implementation period) would take place&#13;
following submission to IBRD, for review and approval, of the related documents and evaluation&#13;
of the proposed experts. The GOP agreed at negotiations to retain the PMU in MTME and&#13;
the GDDP Coordinating Unit of the Roads Project for the implementation of the Roads II&#13;
Project.&#13;
3.20  Supervision of contracts will be the responsibility of the DODPs in the first instance, who&#13;
will request monthly payments to be made from GDDP headquarters where the Project&#13;
Coordinator office would arrange for payment to be made. GDDP's Project Monitoring Team,&#13;
under the lead of the Project Coordinator, will include an accountant/systems expert with&#13;
previous experience in internationally funded projects of this nature, who will establish the&#13;
systems and procedures for financial control of expenditure, and for making quick and efficient&#13;
payments to contractors. The main tasks and responsibilities of the Project Monitoring Team led&#13;
by the Project Coordinator would be:&#13;
*     project coordination, liaison to Government, IBRD, and consultants&#13;
*     planning of works and budgeting&#13;
*     resource allocation&#13;
*     selection, negotiation/award of contracts to the international consultants&#13;
teams and assistance to the consultants in administrative matters&#13;
*     finalization of prequalification and bidding documents&#13;

*     reporting (quarterly) to the Government, and IBRD&#13;
To monitor the progress of the project and to agree on the following year's program, there&#13;
would be a set of performance monitoring indicators (Annex 3.10) to be followed and&#13;
complied with and an annual meeting between the Polish authorities and the Bank prior to&#13;
December 1 of each year, starting in 1997. This has been agreed at negotiations.&#13;
3.21  A Project Implementation Plan (PIP) defining the actions to be performed under the&#13;
project, the agencies, department or units responsible for the execution of each action and the&#13;
latest date to start each action, is shown in Annex 3.8. A Project Procurement Schedule and&#13;
Plan, complementing the PIP, is given in Annex 3.9. Loan effectiveness is expected in late&#13;
fourth quarter 1997, start of project preparation is planned for October 1997, physical&#13;
implementation would begin in October 1997 (emergency) and in January 1998 (non-&#13;
emergency), and the project would be completed by December 31, 2002, with the proposed loan&#13;
closing six months later on June 30, 2003. PMU would submit: (i) quarterly reports to the Bank&#13;
during the implementation of every project component activity on the basis of the performance&#13;
indicators detailed in Annex 3.10; (ii) before Bank approval of the bidding documents, a full&#13;
environmental assessment for each non-emergency new road or bridge, and the proposed flood&#13;
mitigation measures adopted for each emergency road or bridge works; and (iii) on or about&#13;
August 31, 2000 a report (prepared under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank), integrating&#13;
the results of the monitoring and evaluation activities on the progress achieved in the carrying&#13;
out of the Project, and setting out the measures - to be discussed with the Bank before December&#13;
31, 2000 - recommended for the achievement of all project objectives. During negotiations,&#13;
agreement was reached with the Government on the above project implementation and&#13;
procurement schedule, Project Implementation Plan, and monitoring criteria and&#13;
reporting arrangements.&#13;

equivalent) comprises emergency road repairs and bridge reconstruction, as detailed in Annex&#13;
3.3. The works are of urgent nature and required to be contracted at the earliest, so that&#13;
reconstruction work can start without any further delay. The following procurement procedures&#13;
were agreed with the Borrower during Negotiations:&#13;
(i)   International Competitive Bidding  (ICB; US$5.7 million  equivalent)&#13;
procedures will apply to all contracts for civil works estimated to cost US$5.0 million equivalent&#13;
and above. The Borrower will use Bank's standard bidding documents for such contracts.&#13;
According to listing in Annex 3.3 there will be only one ICB contract for US$5.7 million.&#13;
(ii) National Competitive Bidding (NCB; US$54.3 million equivalent): Contracts&#13;
estimated to cost US$0.5 million equivalent but not exceeding US$5.0 million equivalent, will be&#13;
procured in accordance with Bank Guidelines NCB procedures and regional (Europe and Central&#13;
Asia Region; ECA) sample NCB document dated August 1995. The procurement of such works&#13;
according to Polish Procurement Law of 1996 was considered. In view of the time constraints&#13;
involved in meeting Bank's conditions (participation by foreign bidders, domestic preferences,&#13;
prequalification of contractors, and use of Bank approved bidding documents) for use of Polish&#13;
NCB procedures, it was decided to procure these works by using the Bank's NCB procedure and&#13;
bidding documents.&#13;
(iii) Force Account (FA; US$6.0 million equivalent): The use of Force Account&#13;
(FA) would be restricted to minor works estimated to cost US$500,000 equivalent or less each,&#13;
which are dispersed and located in remote rural areas, which are of emergency nature, and when&#13;
private contractors are not available or willing to undertake such works. The procurement under&#13;
FA will be done in accordance with procedures to be agreed with the Bank. Before using the FA&#13;
the Borrower will furnish to the Bank full details of the proposed works: estimated value,&#13;
technical specifications, implementation schedule, production standards for the various work&#13;
items, and the cost accounting systems. Such works will be executed by the regional DODPs&#13;
without enlarging the existing force account units or creating new ones. The Bank disbursement&#13;
will be based on the agreed production standards and predetermined physical units. During&#13;
negotiations, it was pointed out by the Borrower that FA may not be used to extent presently&#13;
anticipated and in such an event, the Borrower would use, with prior intimation to the Bank, the&#13;
three quotation for minor works procedure for the remaining minor works.&#13;

(iv)  Minor Works (MW; US$9.9 million): Minor works (MW) estimated to cost&#13;
US$500,000 equivalent or less each may be procured under lump sum, fixed price contracts&#13;
awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from three qualified domestic contractors in&#13;
response to a written invitation which shall include a detailed description of the work, basic&#13;
specifications and drawings, the required completion date, and a basic form of agreement. The&#13;
award shall be made to the contractor who offers the lowest priced quotation and who has the&#13;
resources to satisfactorily complete the contract. It was further agreed that the Borrower shall&#13;
use the regional ECA sample NCB bidding documents dated September 1995 for contracts of&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent each and above. Contracts below US$100,000 may be procured on the&#13;
basis of the regional ECA sample document "Request For Quotation for Minor Works" dated&#13;
October 1997 or a similar document acceptable to the Bank.&#13;

of the GDDP/PMU. Both are well experienced through the procurement of civil works and&#13;
equipment under the ongoing First Transport and Roads Projects. A project launch workshop is&#13;
also planned closer to the date of effectiveness. Procurement information to be provided to the&#13;
Bank would include: (a) prompt reporting of contract award information; (b) comprehensive&#13;
explanation of revised cost estimates for individual contracts and the total project; (c) revised&#13;
timing of procurement action (including advertising, bidding, contract award and completion&#13;
time for individual contracts); and (d) compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of&#13;
procurement. The above procurement arrangements were agreed during negotiations and&#13;
an agreement was reached with the Government on the Procurement Plan and Schedule&#13;
(Annex 3.9).&#13;

million) of the US$60.8 million Bank participation from August 1, 1997 till the date of loan&#13;
signature, will allow an immediate start on emergency reconstruction and repair items. This was&#13;
agreed at negotiations.&#13;
3.31  To facilitate disbursements in civil works and reduce the volume of withdrawal&#13;
applications, the Bank's share of the project would be financed through two Special Accounts&#13;
(SAs), one for each US Dollar and DEM currency. Both SAs will be opened and maintained by&#13;
the Borrower in the National Bank of Poland or in a commercial bank on terms and conditions&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, including, only in the case of use of a commercial bank, appropriate&#13;
protection against set-off, seizure and attachment. The initial allocation will be US$3.5 million&#13;
and DEM6.3 million for each SA. This amount will be augmented to an authorized allocation of&#13;
US$14.0 million, equivalent to a three-month average disbursement of the loan during the project&#13;
implementation period, once the disbursements under the project reach or exceed 10 percent of&#13;
the loan amount, i.e, US$7.0 million and DEM12.7 million for each SA. Replenishment of the&#13;
SAs will be on monthly basis and would follow Bank procedures. The SAs would be audited&#13;
annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. During negotiations, agreement was&#13;
reached on the establishment and operation of the SAs.&#13;
3.32  A schedule of disbursements, based on the Project Implementation Plan (para 3.21) is&#13;
shown in Annex 3.11. With a late fourth quarter 1997 loan effectiveness date, an October 15,&#13;
1997-March 1, 1998 project preparation (inception) phase, and a March 15, 1998 through&#13;
December 31, 2002 project physical implementation period (para 3.19 - 3.21 and Annex 3.8, and&#13;
3.9), the proposed loan would be fully disbursed six months later on June 30, 2003. No contract&#13;
should be eligible for disbursement after the loan closing date, unless the Bank otherwise agrees.&#13;
I. Accounting and Auditing&#13;
3.33 GDDP already applies adequate Financial Management and Internal Control Systems. A&#13;
team of expatriate experts financed by the Bank is advising and collaborating on the formulation&#13;
and application of these systems. Starting in October 1997, GDDP would establish separate&#13;
project accounts through its PMU in accordance with acceptable accounting principles, record all&#13;
project expenditures, and maintain records on commitments, reimbursements, and the status of&#13;
project funds on the basis of the accounting done by every DODP. With respect to the amounts&#13;
withdrawn on the basis of SOEs, GDDP would maintain records on contracts, invoices and&#13;
evidence of payments readily available for review. All records should also reflect adequately the&#13;
different contributions from the Government. GDDP would submit to the Bank a brief update of&#13;
these accounts in the quarterly reports (para. 3.21). During negotiations, agreement was&#13;
reached that the PMU Secretary would have the project accounts, including SOEs (para.&#13;
3.29), and the special accounts (para. 3.31), audited by an independent auditor acceptable&#13;
to the Bank, and would submit annually to the Bank such audit accounts within six months&#13;
of the end (December 31) of each fiscal year.&#13;

SAR                                                           Roads II Project, Poland&#13;
J. Environmental Impact&#13;
3.34  Most of the project construction consists of rehabilitation/strengthening of existing roads,&#13;
and therefore does not raise any particular environmental concern; furthermore, it would enhance&#13;
the environment through more appropriate quality of existing infrastructure with less erosion, dust,&#13;
noise, and fuel consumption and improved drainage systems and traffic safety. However, the&#13;
inclusion of 12 bypasses and 3 new bridges implies that the project shifts from environment&#13;
category B to category A, in accordance with the provision of OD 4.01.  All required&#13;
Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) are underway (their Executive Summaries have been&#13;
already presented to and agreed at the Bank) on the basis of the TOR in Annex 3.12, and will be&#13;
submitted to the Bank for approval prior to the Bank approval of the bidding documents (para.&#13;
3.21). Every engineering study will include measures (including flood mitigation measures in the&#13;
case of the emergency component works) to mitigate satisfactorily any adverse environmental&#13;
impact of the road works during and after construction. Both, timely submission and approval of&#13;
EIAs before approval of bidding documents, and inclusion of mitigation measures in every&#13;
emergency study, were discussed and agreed at negotiations. The project does not involve any&#13;
resettlement. Frequent contacts and full agreement have taken place with all communities affected,&#13;
with several ecological NGOs, including "Friends of Earth" and the "Polish Ecological Club", and&#13;
every environmental decision has been and will be taken under the umbrella of the Polish Ministry&#13;
of Environmental Protection and National Resources. The legislation on environment from the&#13;
Polish Ministry of Environment is highly satisfactory and, since recently, well enforced.&#13;
3.35  Location of asphalt mixing plants and monitoring of their emissions is also tightly&#13;
controlled by the voivodships. Attachment 1 to Annex 3.12 gives the current emission standards,&#13;
which are being gradually applied to the existing fixed mixing plants formerly part of GDDP.&#13;
These emission standards have been reviewed by the Bank and found acceptable. These&#13;
regulations also apply to disposal of construction site spoil, and the Annex 3.12 comments on the&#13;
monitoring arrangements.&#13;
3.36 The relative small scale of emergency works would not require the opening of new&#13;
quarries or asphalt plant sites. Furthermore, by improving badly damaged road surface,&#13;
shoulders and drainage, and removing downed bridge decks from rivers and their banks, the&#13;
project would have a positive impact on the environment. Therefore, and as an emergency&#13;
operation, the subcomponent has not been assigned an environmental category. However, any&#13;
items which present an opportunity for environmental enhancement, will be designed&#13;
accordingly, and all items will be monitored during supervision to ensure that there is no&#13;
degradation to the environment.&#13;
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
A. Framework&#13;
4.01    The project is consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy of April 14, 1997,&#13;
(para. 13, page 4, and para. 37 and 38, page 11), which concentrates on the removal of&#13;
infrastructure bottlenecks, on creation of the better condition for private sector participation in&#13;
infrastructure, and on infrastructure modernization, as a core part of the strategy for successful EU&#13;
integration and on economic development. Highway sector policy in Poland is set by MTME,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-&#13;
SAR                                                             Roads II Project, Poland&#13;
which in 1993 promulgated a Statement of Aims and Intentions (para. 2.08, Annex 2.3). The&#13;
project is based on GDDP's 1996-2000 Road Investment Program. It would be implemented&#13;
during 1998-2002 through GDDP, except for the road safety program directly under the&#13;
responsibility of MTME. The main lesson learned from the on-going projects is the importance of&#13;
keeping the objectives and composition of the project simple so as not to exceed the absorptive&#13;
capacity of GDDP and MTME staff; this has been taken into account in the project design (paras.&#13;
1.19 and 1.20).&#13;
4.02    The Government has made substantial progress in adopting market-based transport&#13;
policies since the start of the economic transformation in 1990, and there are no major policy&#13;
distortions that will affect project implementation (paras. 1.05 and 1.15). The project will continue&#13;
policy initiatives begun with technical assistance and studies carried out under the on-going&#13;
projects in the areas of improving road maintenance, road safety, and the system of road user&#13;
charges. The project is expected to have a further impact in each of these areas. The project is also&#13;
expected to encourage further privatization of road contracting, maintenance, and planning.&#13;
4.03    The project would facilitate the activities of virtually every sector of the economy, so that&#13;
benefits are likely to be highly dispersed, as is the case with most transport projects. The&#13;
environmental impact of the project would also be positive (reduction of vehicle emissions mainly&#13;
in the bypassed cities, improved preparation of environmental assessments for road projects, less&#13;
soil erosion and noise, and reduction of accidents particularly through the bypasses; paras. 2.16&#13;
through 2.18, and paras. 3.34 through 3.36). Furthermore, the emergency program will reinstate the&#13;
environmental balance damaged by the floods of July 1997.&#13;
4.04    GDDP will monitor the impact of the project both, during implementation with the&#13;
assistance of the PMU, and thereafter, through regular traffic counts on project roads, GDDP&#13;
reports on road maintenance activities, and the collection of road accident statistics by the traffic&#13;
police.&#13;
B. Cost-Benefit Analysis&#13;
4.05    None of the non-emergency road sections for consideration has less than 6,000 vpd, none&#13;
of the bypasses and bridges less than 10,000 vpd. Bypass alignments were selected on the basis of&#13;
avoiding any resettlement, followed by a full cost-benefit and environmental analysis of possible&#13;
alternatives. Any bypass guarantees diversion of, at least, 70 percent of the total traffic. Every&#13;
road, bypass and bridge contract (paras. 3.05 through 3.09; Annexes 3.1 and 3.2) would guarantee a&#13;
minimal economic rate of return (ERR) averaging 25 percent, well above the economic cost of&#13;
capital in Poland, estimated at 12 percent. A summarized economic analysis of three typical works&#13;
contracts is shown in Annex 4.1. The emergency program (Annex 3.3) is an urgent requirement&#13;
likely with higher economic and social returns than the non-emergency program (para. 4.07). The&#13;
project would also provide other benefits which are difficult to quantify, such as improving the&#13;
organization and funding of road maintenance through the new Road Funding Law (para. 2.11),&#13;
promotion of privatization through competitive procurement, reduction in road accidents through&#13;
the GAMBIT program (paras. 3.12 and 3.13), and environmental improvements through well&#13;
conceived and implemented EIAs (para. 3.34). Hence, no ERRs have been calculated for the road&#13;
safety program (2.8 percent of project cost), road maintenance activities (3.4 percent of project&#13;
cost), and TA/training (1.3 percent of project cost).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31-&#13;
SAR                                                             Roads II Project. Poland&#13;
4.06    GDDP did the cost and benefit analyses and clearly has the capacity to do the job&#13;
satisfactorily. Every (civil works contract) economic study reviewed and verified by the appraisal&#13;
mission showed significant precision and detail. Costs and benefits were measured net of taxes.&#13;
Cost estimates included physical (10 percent) and price (5 percent) contingencies. Current traffic&#13;
levels were estimated based on counts carried out by GDDP. Poland's high vehicle ownership rate,&#13;
current high traffic growth rate (about 5 percent per annum) and prospects for the future, are&#13;
discussed in para. 2.04. Traffic on the project roads is expected to grow rapidly through 2005,&#13;
when vehicle ownership would reach the current level of EU countries. Congestion effects were&#13;
specifically taken into account in the design of bypasses.  Cost savings per km on road&#13;
rehabilitation/modernization are US$0.05 per km (10 percent of present vehicle operating cost) for&#13;
the average light vehicle and US$0.20 per km (15 percent of present vehicle operating cost) for the&#13;
average heavy vehicle. In the case of bypasses, savings are doubled because construction of a&#13;
bypass adds to pavement betterment further improvements on road safety and urban pollution, and&#13;
the elimination of traffic congestion.&#13;
4.07    Rates of return for emergency road and bridge reconstruction are expected to be high&#13;
since: (i) downed bridges are critical bottlenecks causing, at certain locations, long waiting time;&#13;
(ii) damaged roads and bridges are being used, despite the constant risk of collapse; and (iii)&#13;
rehabilitation of landshields will avoid further degradation of the road sections. Moreover, the&#13;
proposed project will support the restart of normal activity of industry and trade through the re-&#13;
establishment of transport links.&#13;
C. Project Risk Analysis&#13;
4.08  The main risk is the availability of adequate budgetary funds for GDDP, which are&#13;
presently insufficient. The fiscal pressures in Poland are likely to remain such that careful&#13;
evaluation of priorities and on-going discussions on inter- and intra-sectoral budgetary tradeoffs&#13;
will continue to be essential. Hence, GDDP's budget would be annually reviewed and agreed&#13;
with the Bank (para. 3.05). This agreement would cover the allocation of sufficient resources,&#13;
their adequate distribution between maintenance and new construction, and adequate economic&#13;
returns for the proposed investments. This same procedure would also reduce the risk that&#13;
Poland might initiate a program of rapid motorway construction at the expense of neglecting the&#13;
existing network. The enforcement of the Road Funding Law starting January 1, 1998 (para.&#13;
2.11), and the fact that the civil works contracts financed by the project will be let in four annual&#13;
batches, further reduces these risks. Both GDDP's ability to manage the project as well as the&#13;
capability of the Polish construction industry have been noted as a low risk of the project given&#13;
the successful implementation of two Bank projects. Nevertheless, technical assistance and&#13;
training have been included as part of the project, and there will be close follow-up of these&#13;
aspects by supervision missions.&#13;

Intentions and Aims of The Ministry of Transport&#13;
and Maritime Economy with regard to&#13;
Development of Road Sector in Poland&#13;
January 1993&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.3&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
The Ministry of Transport and Maritime Economy (MT&amp;ME) fully appreciates&#13;
importance of road network in efficient functioning and development of national economy&#13;
and international cooperation.&#13;
At the same time MT&amp;ME is fully aware of continuous deterioration of the road&#13;
network resulting from underfmancing of the road sector in recent years. Aiming at&#13;
modifying that status, transport sector, undertakes a number of organizational and technical&#13;
actions described in this study.  Efforts are also made to increase expenditures for&#13;
maintenance and road sector development. One of such efforts is development and&#13;
implementation of the policy of increased direct road users participation in costs involved in&#13;
road network maintenance and modernization, which should, within short period of time,&#13;
result in achieving adequate level of expenditures for current maintenance of existing roads.&#13;
Particular attention will be paid to proper planning and management, economical&#13;
project evaluation, road safety improvement, and also implementation of more effective&#13;
managing of financial resources.&#13;
Program of MT&amp;ME aims will be implemented in the following areas:&#13;
1.    Setting road sector priorities.&#13;
Fundamental priorities are recognized as:&#13;
insuring proper level of existing roads and bridges maintenance;&#13;
continuous modernization of main road network, including "bottle necks"&#13;
elimination; and&#13;
road safety improvement.&#13;
2.   Insuring adequate budgetary levels for national road network maintenance.&#13;
In 1993 road sector will be financed from the following sources:&#13;
-     budgetary expenditures for road maintenance;&#13;
-     budgetary expenditures for investments;&#13;
-     income from: granting concession for operating international road transport,&#13;
issuing single international haulage permits, and also periodical foreign permits&#13;
for multiple haulage; and&#13;
-     support financing of the Motorway A-4 sections completion, construction of&#13;
which has already been started (Krakow bypass, access road to Katowice),&#13;
planned to be constructed as mutual undertaking with European Bank for&#13;
Reconstruction and Development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2.3&#13;

3.    Users charges.&#13;
The modification works of the Public Roads Bill are continued. The modified Bill&#13;
will allow charging tolls for the use of motorways, expressways and exit roads leading to&#13;
establishments carrying on commercial activities.&#13;
Legislative works related to the Bill modification are also aimed at granting&#13;
concessions for motorways construction, and for motorway construction with participation of&#13;
private or state, domestic or foreign capital.&#13;
According to MT&amp;ME aims, expenditures for road maintenance have been recognized&#13;
as high priority.&#13;
Figures and structure of road expenditures are shown on the attached illustration.&#13;
It is planned, in accordance with the project of new Public Roads Bill, to shorten the&#13;
length of national road network financed through the State Budget, which will bring down the&#13;
level of expenditures for these roads.&#13;
The delegation negotiating loan with the World Bank has been given authority to state&#13;
that Polish Government shall make efforts to:&#13;
halt in 1993 decrease of budget expenditures for national roads maintenance;&#13;
ensure gradual increase of budgetary expenditures to the level recognized as&#13;
technically and economically justified; and&#13;
1990 level of road maintenance expenditures (approximately US$340 million)&#13;
is recognized as technically and economically justified. Such a level will be&#13;
obtained as soon as the budgetary situation of the State will allow.&#13;

ROADS II PROJECT&#13;
Road Maintenance Equipment, Vehicles and Materials&#13;
1.    Small quantities of road maintenance equipment, few vehicles and materials are&#13;
already being provided under the ongoing Roads' project. Because of the critical importance&#13;
of ongoing maintenance and the present shortfall in the maintenance budget, an additional&#13;
significant provision has been made for the supply of maintenance equipment, vehicles and&#13;
materials. This will include assistance with winter maintenance procedures.&#13;
A.   Vehicles&#13;
2.    To reduce the requirement for many sources of spare parts, it is preferable to&#13;
standardise on a fleet of vehicles and it is intended to proceed with the procurement of modem&#13;
types of maintenance vehicles. It is intended to equip the DODP Maintenance Units with Pick&#13;
up trucks for transport of materials and site inspections and Multi purpose vehicles to replace&#13;
existing outdated and inefficient vehicles.&#13;
B.   Equipment&#13;
3.    Universal vehicle possessing the options for many maintenance applications, are now&#13;
available on the market, and it is intended to purchase those suitable to Polish requirements.&#13;
These options will cover winter maintenance in the form of snow clearance by blade and&#13;
blowers and sand/salt applications to icy roads. However, the versatility of the range of&#13;
equipment available covers many other essential maintenance procedures and a list of other&#13;
typical equipment to be purchased for these vehicles will also include provision for other&#13;
maintenance actives such as:&#13;
(i) Shoulder and ditch cleaning; (ii) Grass and tree cutting; (iii) Cleaning traffic signs; (iv)&#13;
Drilling foundations for barriers, posts, signs and lights; (v) Removal of obstructions; (vi)&#13;
Drain cleaning; and (vii) Pot hole repairs.&#13;
C.   Materials&#13;
4.    Materials required to be purchased under the Project include the provision of guard-&#13;
rails, barriers, lights and signs suitable for efficient and safe road maintenance activities.&#13;
There is an increasing awareness of the importance of safe road working, which are mostly&#13;
concerned with maintenance activities and the need for suitable signs, lights and barriers. The&#13;
need to adequately equip the DODP maintenance units is recognized. Stocks of safely guard&#13;
rails are also required to be held by the units for emergency repairs and for local programs to&#13;
upgrade the guard-rail requirements along dangerous sections of road.&#13;

ROADS n1 PROJECT&#13;
Technical Assistance &amp; Training&#13;
1.    An extensive prograrn of Technical Assistance (TA) and Training is included in the&#13;
project that will continue and expand the progress made under the Roads Project. There is an&#13;
ongoing demand for technical assistance and training. This is based on the success of the&#13;
work so far and the appraisal of future demand.&#13;
2.    The scope of the TA &amp; Training component under the Roads II Project is to extend the&#13;
technical assistance provided under the Roads Project as well as in the field of road&#13;
maintenance, privatization of the management, construction and design methods,&#13;
modernization of the construction and consulting industries, and the Road Safety Program. It&#13;
would also include a Road User Charges Study (estimated cost US$250,000) to define the&#13;
adequate contribution of each type of vehicle on the basis of damage infringed to the roads.&#13;
3.    During the Roads Project the supply of expatriate advisors to support the operation of&#13;
the PMU has worked well. Also the Consultants have arranged and delivered training courses&#13;
and follow up seminars for GDDP/DODP staff on many topics, such as the forms of contract,&#13;
management and supervision of contract works, seminars on financial control and pilot&#13;
courses for former State enterprise contractors covering forrns of contract, bidding and&#13;
management of contracts.&#13;
4.    Not all DODP staff have had the opportunity to participate on the training course and&#13;
the new loan will also involve some new DODP's. The feedback from staff attending these&#13;
courses and follow up seminars has been very positive. It is necessary to update the course&#13;
material in light of the more sophisticated understanding now of many staff and new Bank&#13;
guidelines. A comprehensive program of courses should be prepared during the winter&#13;
months that would cover new and in some cases previous participants to refresh and reinforce&#13;
their understanding. Follow up seminars will also be included. These are normally&#13;
workshops held one year later and previous course participants are invited back to present&#13;
their practical experiences and discuss problems encountered. Training is not a static process&#13;
and in this way the advantage of the benefits to the individual can be monitored and improved.&#13;
The advantages are now being seen in the end product, better management and quality&#13;
supervision of contracts.&#13;
5.    The pilot courses prepared for contractors have also received positive feedback. There&#13;
is an urgent necessity to assist in the modernisation of the old state contracting enterprises and&#13;
equip them for the present world of competitiveness. Advice on aspects involved in the&#13;
privatization, financing, organization, management and operation of a modern contracting&#13;
organization will be given. This will include details of plant possible leasing arrangements;&#13;
preliminary discussions have already been held to establish the interest and feasibility of&#13;
assisting small contractors through leasing major and expensive items of plant instead of the&#13;
costly purchase options that they cannot at present afford. In this way they are better equipped&#13;
to compete with larger foreign and local companies.&#13;

6.    As well as implementation of further training as noted above, a brief description and&#13;
budget cost of training targets proposed is given below. These include other areas of&#13;
deficiency identified during the Roads Project and also taken into account aspects recorded in&#13;
the needs assessment survey carried out by Consultants for GDDP and DODP staff in 1994.&#13;
A.   Forms of Contract, Procurement, Supervision and Management of Contract&#13;
Works (for GDDP, DODP and local consultants staff)&#13;
8.    With well over 100 contracts envisaged under the Roads II Project this will involve&#13;
several hundred personnel at different levels in the procurement and management of the&#13;
Contracts, from Project and Resident Engineers to Site Inspectors. The one week courses&#13;
given so far will be developed to target separate groups, from Senior Managers to more Junior&#13;
Inspectors. Specific guidance will be given on the processes involved in contract procurement&#13;
and administration under the emergency loan procedures.&#13;
Estimated Cost US$280.000&#13;
B.   Design and Specification Standards (for BPRSD, DODP and local consultants).&#13;
9.    During the Roads Project  some progress was made in the standardisation of&#13;
specifications. It is necessary that this will be reviewed with the aim to produce a standard&#13;
specification for road and bridge works. The standardization of designs and the production of&#13;
a standard set of road and bridge detailed drawings for routine uses should also be advanced.&#13;
Courses will be run for appropriate staff on how this should be implemented.&#13;
Estimated Cost US$50.000&#13;
C.   Financial Management of Projects (for GDDP/DODP)&#13;
10.   Training on specific and routine aspects of Financial Management will be further&#13;
developed. This will include, at the more senior level, management of the Loan procedures,&#13;
planning, budgeting and payment procedures while the preparation and processing of monthly&#13;
certificates will also be covered.&#13;
Estimated Cost US$50,000&#13;
D.   Arbitration and the role of Adjudicators in Civil Engineering Contracts (for&#13;
selected Polish Engineers).&#13;
11.   Based on experience gained this important aspect will be covered by the organization&#13;
of selected seminars to enable a better understanding of international contract arbitration&#13;
procedures.&#13;
Estimated Cost US$30.000&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.6&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
E.    "On the Job" Practical Training Schemes.&#13;
12.   The use of a larger contract to be involved in some practical, on site training, will be&#13;
investigated.&#13;
Estimated Cost US$20.000&#13;
F.    Road Maintenance Organization and Procedures (for GDDP, DODP's)&#13;
13.   One of the principal aims of the Roads II Project is to improve road maintenance&#13;
procedures and it is envisaged that detailed training will be given to personnel involved in the&#13;
planning and implementation of road maintenance. This should take the form of classroom&#13;
lectures supplemented by selected visits to sister maintenance organizations in Europe.&#13;
Estimated Cost US$90,000&#13;
G.   State Contracting Enterprises&#13;
14.   Following from the experience gained under the pilot courses already given to some&#13;
contractors it would be worthwhile to develop this approach. The courses have offered advice&#13;
from local and international professionals in the industry on modernization and dealing with&#13;
present types of contract, from the understanding of forms of contract and bid procedures to&#13;
the organisation of the site works and measurement.   Aspects covering the issues of&#13;
privatisation, capitalization and plant leasing will be introduced.&#13;
Estimated Cost US$52.000&#13;
H.   Assistance to PMU&#13;
15.   The existing PMU is coping well despite a heavy work load.  Some technical&#13;
assistance in the overall monitoring of the project and the day to day solutions of contract&#13;
problems should be still available if required. Works under the component for the emergency&#13;
works will place an extra burden on the PMU that may require further advice and support.&#13;
Estimated Cost US$300,000&#13;
I.    Rutting and Axle-loading&#13;
16.   Few survey reports have been prepared on the problem of rutting to the road surface in&#13;
many areas of Poland. Progress has been made and new guidelines have been issued but&#13;
further investigations will be carried out into the sufficiency of the new measures and where&#13;
necessary more in-depth testing should be carried out and some limited experimental surfaces&#13;
monitored to effectively solve the rutting problem.&#13;
Estimated Cost US$l100.000&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

J.    Road Safety/Police Training&#13;
17.   See Attachment I.&#13;
Estimated cost US$463.000 equivalent.&#13;
K.   Training Centres&#13;
18.   The DODP's already have a network of training centres well placed around Poland,&#13;
including the new Jozefow Training Centre near Warsaw. It gives the flexibility for courses&#13;
and seminars to be either centralised (at Jozefow) or taken to the regional centres. Courses&#13;
run so far have successfully followed a pattern that combines both options as is found most&#13;
suitable. It is envisaged that many of the proposed courses would be run from Jozefow,&#13;
although the use of regional centres will be encouraged. Facilities at the Jozefow and other&#13;
centres will be reviewed.&#13;
Estimated Cost US$25.000&#13;

POLAND&#13;
ROADS II PROJECT&#13;
Road User Charges Study - Terms of Reference&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    There are three conditions which must be taken into account in assessing the system of&#13;
road user charges in Poland. First, the revenue directly linked to road use and vehicle&#13;
operations in Poland are as follows: turnover tax on vehicles; vehicle registration fees; drivers&#13;
licensing fees; fuel taxes; and fees from international road transport concessions. All revenues&#13;
from these sources go to the state budget except the registration fees and vehicle driver&#13;
licensing fees, which are levied by the local authorities. The Government, following the&#13;
transition, uses the fuel tax as a major source of general revenue because it is easy to collect,&#13;
impacts the wealthy more than the poor, because it is common practice in most European&#13;
countries, and because it reflects the social costs of vehicle emissions. The retail price of&#13;
normal gasoline in Poland (UJS$0.50-0.53 equivalent per liter) ranks 24th among 35&#13;
representative European countries, while diesel fuel (US$0.40 equivalent per liter) ranks 25th.&#13;
Second, the national road network is mostly in poor or fair condition, requiring rehabilitation&#13;
before it is capable of being maintained (particularly periodic maintenance). The PMS&#13;
(following Bank HDM III), on the other hand, assumes that the road network is in sufficiently&#13;
good condition that it can be maintained through normal maintenance procedures. Third, a&#13;
significant part of the local rural road network was built by cooperatives which now have&#13;
disappeared. Many of these roads are not maintained, and part of them may be abandoned in&#13;
the future. Under these circumstances, the PMS model is most useful in indicating the funds&#13;
which would be needed to maintain the main rural network (and urban network) after most&#13;
roads have been rehabilitated, which will take a number of years.&#13;
2.   A new formulation of the road user charges issue is appropriate. This formulation&#13;
would focus on the overall balance between the tax revenues received from each type of road&#13;
user (focusing on heavy diesel vehicles) and the costs that each user imposes on the network,&#13;
namely new construction, rehabilitation, maintenance, congestion, accident costs and other&#13;
measurable externalities.&#13;
3.   The taxation would promote an adequate modal split, an efficient use of resources and&#13;
contribute to a better coordination of the transport system.&#13;
Study Objectives&#13;
4.   The main objectives of the study are to ensure that:&#13;
(i) the fees and taxes paid by road users are clearly separated from the user charges&#13;
they pay for use of the road network;&#13;
(ii) all service fees are appropriate, well structured, effectively administered, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.7&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
cover the costs of providing these services (e.g., driver license fees, vehicle&#13;
inspection fees, registration fees, etc.);&#13;
(iii) all taxes paid by road users are consistent with the taxes paid on similar plant&#13;
and equipment, are well structured, and effectively administered to minimize&#13;
avoidance and evasion;&#13;
(iv) the taxes on fuel reflect the Governments objectives regarding fuel&#13;
conservation,vehicle emissions, etc. and also promote economic efficiency;&#13;
(v) RUCs are set so that each class of vehicle covers the costs it imposes on the&#13;
road network ("waer and tear" costs, mainly for heavy diesel vehicles); and&#13;
(vi) all vehicles collectively generate sufficient revenue to finance the overall road&#13;
program, bearing in mind that some road expenditures are likely to be financed&#13;
on the cost-sharing basis.&#13;
Scole of Work&#13;
5.   The consultant will be expected to carry out the following tasks:&#13;
(i) Review all the fees, taxes and charges paid by road users and, in consultation with&#13;
the Ministry of Finance, separate them into services fees, general taxes, and RUCs. Service&#13;
fees generally cover services which establish title to property (to facilitate law enforcement),&#13;
check vehicles for mechanical soundness (to promote road safety), and ensure drivers are&#13;
competent (also to promote road safety).&#13;
(ii) Examine the nature and structure of these fees, and the costs of providing the&#13;
services they cover. Advise on whether any fees are redundant or unenforceable (e.g., vehicle&#13;
transfer fees), whether the structure could be improved to minimize avoidance and evasion,&#13;
their administration could be strengthened (e.g., by contracting services out to the private&#13;
sector) , and they cover the costs of the services provided. Recommend appropriate changes.&#13;
(iii) Review all taxes paid by road users and compare them with the taxes paid on&#13;
similar plant and equipment. Recommend changes to bring them into line with other tax rates&#13;
and suggest what steps might be taken to simplify the tax structure and strengthen&#13;
administration of transport taxes to minimize avoidance and evasion.&#13;
(iv) Review the taxes imposed on transport fuels and identify the objectives&#13;
underlying these tax rates.  In particular, examine whether they reflect any energy&#13;
conservation objectives, environmental objectives, trade and industrial policy objectives, or&#13;
income distribution objectives, particularly with regard to the taxation of kerosene (which can&#13;
be substituted for diesel).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.7&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
Also examine whether any attempt has been made to impose an optimal tax, based on the low&#13;
price elasticity of demand for transport fuels. Recommend appropriate changes that would&#13;
enable fuel taxes to better reflect the Governments objectives and that would also contribute&#13;
towards an optimal tax structure. Also recommend relative price levels that would minimize&#13;
substitution between different transport fuels (particularly karosene and diesel) or, in case&#13;
wide differentials are unavoidable, recommend what other administrative steps might be taken&#13;
to minimize substitution between different transport fuels.&#13;
(v) Examine the structure of existing RUCs for each main vehicle class (at least three&#13;
class of heavy trucks) and compare the annual payments by each vehicle class with the&#13;
estimated costs each class imposes on the road network. Also examine how well the RUCs&#13;
are administered. Recommend changes in the number and structure of the RUCs, and the way&#13;
they are administered, to ensure that evasion and avoidance are minimized and each vehicle&#13;
class covers the avoidable costs it imposes on the road network. The resulting RUCs should&#13;
be simple, readily recognizable by road users, and easy to administer.&#13;
(vi) In congested urban areas, examine the feasibility of imposing some form of urban&#13;
congestion charge to be added to the regular RUCs. These recommendations should be&#13;
formulated in consultation with the concerned municipalities and should focus on charging&#13;
systems which are acceptable, can be administered by the municipalities, and can be readily&#13;
enforced.&#13;
(vii) Review the financing plan for the overall road network and, based on planned&#13;
expenditures and proposed cost-sharing arrangements, recommend a level of RUCs which&#13;
would generate sufficient revenues to fully-finance the overall expenditure plan. These&#13;
recommendations should bear in mind that the final expenditure plan must be scaled back (or&#13;
cost-sharing arrangements revised) to produce an acceptable level of RUCs.&#13;
Staffing&#13;
6.   The Study would be carried out by a team of about three consultants, covering:&#13;
transport planning              6 months&#13;
transport economics             3 months&#13;
financial/fiscal analysis        3 months&#13;

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
The Road Network Development Planning Office sends attached a list of tasks&#13;
qualified for implementation under the Second Road Project cofinanced by the World Bank,&#13;
realization of which is expected in the years 1998-2002. Values of separate works are listed&#13;
in the 1997 prices. General rules of documents preparation, procurement of works and their&#13;
performance are the same as in the previous Road Project. Bidding Documents must be&#13;
issued in the English language (which is obligatory basic version). For local contractors or&#13;
suppliers the Borrower may provide Polish translation of the English version of the Bidding&#13;
Documents.&#13;
A.   Emergency rehabilitation of flood-damaged roads and bridges&#13;
Due to the urgent nature of the emergency roads and bridges repair, preparatory works&#13;
connected to the emergency contracts commencing in the 1998 should be urgently taken up,&#13;
and planned within the expedited timing as follows:&#13;
preparation of materials and bidding documents by the Regional Directorate of&#13;
Public Roads (DODP) - October 20, 1997&#13;
* invitation for bids - November 28, 1997&#13;
submission of bids - January 12, 1998&#13;
* signing the Performance Agreement with Contractor - February 6, 1998&#13;
* commencement of works - March 16, 1998&#13;
B.   Non-emergency civil works&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3.8&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
The three remaining non-emergency groups (Group II, III and IV) of civil works contracts&#13;
will be procured once a year, and the implementation deadline will be the following:&#13;
*  preparation of materials by the Regional Directorate of Public Roads (DODP) for&#13;
prequalification of bidders - April 15&#13;
*  advertising prequalification of bidders - June 30&#13;
*  prequalification of bidders - August 31&#13;
*  preparation of bidding documents - June 30&#13;
*  obtaining construction permissions - June 30&#13;
*  invitation for bids - October 15&#13;
*  submission of bids - December 15&#13;
*  signing the Performance Agreement with Contractor - February 15 (next year)&#13;
*  commencement of works - March 15 (next year)&#13;
This procedure will be repeated three times, starting on April 15, 1998 according to the Time-&#13;
Table on the attached List, each time in the year preceding commencement of works.&#13;
Materials for prequalification comprise description of tasks in English together with&#13;
initial Engineer's evaluation in current prices without VAT. Printout of work description&#13;
should be forwarded together with a diskette (Word 6.Opl). Initial Engineer's evaluations for&#13;
tasks to be commenced in 1998 should be sent only when the investment inputs determined at&#13;
present time will differ from those sent to the Road Network Development Planning Office in&#13;
autumn 1996 be more than 10 percent.&#13;
At the same time the BPRSD requires that together with materials for bidders'&#13;
prequalification to submit information concerning:&#13;
*  environmental protection - titles and dates of prepared documentation (study,&#13;
analysis, etc.), xerocopies oI opinions, or declaration on absence of such&#13;
requirements, should be submitted.&#13;
*  land acquisition. Land acquisition according to the law should be confirmed in&#13;
form of declaration. Construction permission (copy) should be sent, with deadline&#13;
on June 30.&#13;
Generic Documents, helpful in preparation of bidding documents, are available in the English&#13;
and Polish language at BPRSD (to be copied - Word 6.Opl).&#13;
These documents should not be changed, amended or modified. Only Bidding Data and&#13;
Contract Data applications should be completed. Road Network Development Planning&#13;
Office is to provide at a later date detailed guidelines that will concern filling out the generic&#13;
documents, bid security amount, insurance and realization period.&#13;
BPRSD requests name and telephone number of a person:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

prequalification and bidding documents and giving any other necessary&#13;
information.&#13;
*  designer, name and address of design office.&#13;
At the same time BPRSD reminds that according to Regulation No. 9 General Director&#13;
of Public Roads dated April 28, 1995 concerning principles of elaboration of Bidding&#13;
Documents for works financed from the World Bank means, the DODP bears responsibility&#13;
for checking of Bidding Documents which are finally approved by the Regional Managing&#13;
Director Public Roads. Therefore all documents delivered to the Road Network Development&#13;
Planning Office should be verified by DODP. BPRSD kindly request to confirm till January&#13;
30, ability to prepare tasks which were qualified for commencement of works in 1998.&#13;
The acquisition and delivery of the Equipment and Materials for Road Maintenance&#13;
and Road Safety would be procured during the first two years (1998 and 1999) of project&#13;
implementation, following Annexes 3.4 and 3.5 of the SAR.&#13;
Technical assistance and training will be implemented according to needs, during the&#13;
whole 5-year project implementation period, following Annexes 3.6 and 3.7 of the SAR&#13;

I.   INTRODUCTION&#13;
At the request of the Polish Government, The World Bank in close cooperation with&#13;
the GDDP, are developing the Roads II project.&#13;
The nature and size of the investment part of the project, as well as its potential&#13;
environmental impacts require, according to the Polish environmental regulations: "Ustawa o&#13;
Autostradach Platnych I Rpozporzdazenie Ministra Ochrony Srodowiska z dnia S czerwca&#13;
1994, Ustawa o Zagospodarowaniu Przestrzennym Z DNL9 7 lipca 1994, Rozporzadzenie&#13;
Ministra Ochrony Srodowiska i Zasobow Naturalnych z dnia 13 maja 1995 oraz Ustawa 0&#13;
Ochronie i Ksztaltowaniu Srodowiska z dnia 31 stycznia 1980", and those of the participating&#13;
financial institutions, the carrying out of an environmental assessment.&#13;
The project has been ranked as category "A" for the purpose of the World Bank&#13;
Operational Directive O.D. 4.01, which means that a full environmental assessment study is&#13;
required before the banks can approve the project for its financing.&#13;
The study area for the assessment consist of the (i) improvement the main road&#13;
network (highways, bridges, bypasses); (ii) study and solve the rutting situation on the&#13;
network; (iii) promote the competitive capacity of domestic contractors through improvement&#13;
of their technical, managerial, and financial capacity; (iv) improve the road safety situation;&#13;
(v) adjust road user charges for different road rehabilitation including bypasses.&#13;
II.    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY&#13;
The environmental assessment study is being developed to: (i) assess potential&#13;
environmental consequences of the potential project alternatives; (ii) help guide the design of&#13;
the proposed project's alternative to minimize any potential negative environmental impacts&#13;
which might occur during construction and operation, and (iii) to formulate recommendations&#13;
concerning measures that should be undertaken in order to maintain conditions for the&#13;
protection of the environment in the project areas.&#13;
This study with its recommendations will be the basis for applying for an&#13;
environmental permits from the regional authorities.&#13;
III.   SCOPE OF WORK&#13;
Under these Terms of References the consultant is required to prepare an&#13;
Environmental Assessment Study. Specifically this means:&#13;

The objective of the consultations is to inform all interested parties as to the project concept&#13;
and to ensure that their concerns and comments are incorporated into the design, route&#13;
election, mitigation measures, monitoring programs and community communication&#13;
programs. The consultation process must build public confidence in the anticipated sites,&#13;
route of the bypass or bridge, construction phases, operation, and the monitoring program.&#13;
(d)   Review and analysis of Polish and European Union, international agreements to which&#13;
Poland is a Party, and other international agreements pertinent to the project scope.&#13;
(e)   Where data is insufficient and prevents accurate prediction of environmental impacts,&#13;
an estimation based on the most likely conditions prevailing at a project area, or based on&#13;
similar predictions at other areas previously evaluated by the Consultant, should be used.&#13;
(f)   Presenting a full draft EA report, in a concise manner, and focusing on the significant&#13;
environmental issues is required in a format similar to the following:&#13;

Page 2 of 5&#13;
III.   Procedures&#13;
1.    Before the investment decision is made the investor receives guidelines from&#13;
respective state administration body.&#13;
If the investment may present hazard to human health or environment it is&#13;
necessary to attach the environmental impact assessment prepared by an expert&#13;
in this area. The expert is chosen by local state authority on voivodship level.&#13;
2.    To the request for site selection, if the investment is to be hazardous for human&#13;
health or environmental impact assessment.&#13;
3.    Evaluating road investment impact on environment acceptable indicators of air,&#13;
water and soil pollution are considered. Another considered factor is noise&#13;
level defined by regulation mentioned in pt. I and presented in Appendix 1 &amp;&#13;
3.&#13;
IV.   Coordinating Bodies&#13;
According to the regulations:&#13;
-     motor and expressways construction requires clearing with Ministry of&#13;
Environmental Protection.  Natural Resources and Forestry.  Ecological&#13;
assessment can only be prepared by qualified experts.&#13;
-     bypass construction and adding of a second carriageway to all purpose roads&#13;
requires clearance from voivodship authorities. In most of the cases it is&#13;
sufficient to use studies prepared by designing offices.&#13;
-     all purpose roads modernization like wearing course, adding hard shoulders or&#13;
slow traffic lanes do not require consultations.&#13;
-     construction of new road production plants require clearance from voivodship&#13;
bodies.&#13;
Plants that up to date did not have environmental impact assessment must&#13;
obtain such and clear them.&#13;
V.    Environmental Control&#13;
Environmental Control regarding road after the construction is completed in not&#13;
carried out as yet.&#13;
Production plants are periodically checked by Environmental Research and Control&#13;
Centers along the lines of generally accepted rules.&#13;
Acceptable levels of air pollution (according to the regulation of Ministry of&#13;
Environment, Natural Resources and Forestry, of 12.12.1990, regarding air protection):&#13;

            Poland - Second Roads Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The main objective of the Second Roads
            Project, the first phase of a two-pronged highway
            improvement strategy, is to support and speed up the
            modernization of the road sector according to the policy
            initiated by Poland under the First Roads Project. The
            project components cover the three main areas (policy,
            institutional, and physical investments) of Poland's
            1996-2000 Road Investment Program (RIP). The first
            component, policy, comprises 1) adequate maintenance and
            strengthening of high priority roads, including bridges, and
            winter maintenance, with adequate budgets; 2) review and
            adjustment of road user charge levels and distribution
            between different user groups to balance costs and revenues;
            3) further action on the road axle-load policy; and 4)
            establishment of a leasing policy to enhance and speed up
            privatization of local contractors. The second component
            calls for: 1) further restructuring, privatization, and
            development of the road contracting industry, focusing on
            improving managerial, financial and technical capacity, and
            in establishing professional associations to enhance their
            competitiveness; 2) improving the coordination,
            collaboration, and operation of government agencies on the
            ongoing road safety program; and 3) assisting the vehicle
            inspection center. The third component, infrastructure,
            consists of: 1) rebuilding, upgrading, realigning, and
            resurfacing priority road sections and their crossings
            through cities; 2) rebuilding and upgrading 2 bridges, and
            building 3 new major bridges; 3) constructing 12 bypasses
            around congested cities; 4) emergency reconstruction of
            flood-damaged high priority infrastructure; 5) acquiring
            road maintenance and road safety equipment, vehicles, and
            materials; and 6) technical assistance and training for the
            ongoing road safety program in management, planning,
            pavement and maintenance systems, environmental protection,
            modern design and construction techniques, and privatization
            of local consultants and contractors.
