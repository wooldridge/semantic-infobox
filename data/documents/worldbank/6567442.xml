            The informality trap: tax evasion, finance,
            and productivity in Brazil
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This Note highlights the adverse
            consequences of informality for private sector development
            and explains what governments can do about it. It uses new
            data from the World Bank's Investment Climate Survey in
            Brazil that show for the first time the extent of tax
            evasion and confirm that informal firms are less productive
            and less likely to access financial markets than other
            firms. It also provides some advice on how to tackle the
            problem-by emphasizing the benefits of regulatory
            compliance, reducing the costs of going formal, and
            tightening up enforcement.
