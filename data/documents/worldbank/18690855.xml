RECOMMENDATION OF STATA d*RY COMMITTEE&#13;
TO:    The President, International Development Association&#13;
Recommendation of the Committee under Section 1(d) of Article V of the Articles of&#13;
Agreement on the proposed Financing (Third Growth and Competitiveness Credit and Grant)&#13;
to Burkina Faso&#13;
The undersigned Committee constituted under Section 1 (d) of Article V of the Articles of Agreement of&#13;
the International Development Association (the Association) hereby submits its recommendation pursuant&#13;
to said Section in respect of the proposal that the Association extend to Burkina Faso (the Recipient) a&#13;
credit in an amount equivalent to thirty-two million six hundred thousand Special Drawing Rights&#13;
(SDR 32,600,000 million) and a grant in an amount equivalent to thirty-two million six hundred thousand&#13;
Special Drawing Rights (SDR 32,600,000 million). The purpose of said credit and grant is to continue to&#13;
support the Recipient's program to promote growth and achieve sustainable reductions in poverty, with a&#13;
particular focus on (a) catalyzing private sector growth and employment, (b) improving governance and&#13;
public resource management, and (c) increasing resilience and reducing vulnerability.&#13;
1.     The Committee has carefully studied the merits of the proposal to extend such a financing, and of&#13;
the purpose to which the proceeds of the financing are to be applied.&#13;
2.     The Committee is of the opinion that the program in support of which the proceeds of such&#13;
financing are to be applied comes within the purposes of the Association as set forth in Article I of said&#13;
Articles of Agreement, and that said program is designed to promote the economic development of the&#13;
Recipient and is of high developmental priority in the light of the needs of the Recipient.&#13;
3.     Accordingly, the Committee finds that said program merits financial assistance from the&#13;
Association, and hereby recommends said program for such assistance.&#13;
