EDUCATIONAL AND ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF PROMOTION&#13;
AND REPETITION PRACTICES&#13;
This paper presents policies, practices and problems of student flow,&#13;
and related research findings to the questions: What are the determinants&#13;
of achievement and their- implications for promotion practices? How valid&#13;
are the criteria used in promotion decisions? What are the comparative&#13;
effects of promotion practices on the achievement and personality of&#13;
pupils? What are the other educational options to deal with failure and&#13;
low achievement?&#13;
On the basis of the studies reviewed, it was concluded that (a) the&#13;
dynamics of success and failure can best be represented by a multidimen-&#13;
sional interactive matrix of school-related and out-of-school variables;&#13;
(b) promotion decisions are based on unreliable measures of academic&#13;
performance and ignore affective and social goals of education; (c) there&#13;
is no evidence that repetition is more effective than promotion, or that&#13;
repetition practices improve academic standards and class homogeneity; and&#13;
(d) grade retention has certain negative effects on a pupil's self-concept&#13;
and attitude.&#13;
Although promotion seems to be more desirable than retention, the real&#13;
issue is that of prevention of failure. Consequently an educational strategy&#13;
is suggested, the basic elements of which are a nongraded curriculum, ability&#13;
grouping and a new role for educational measurement.&#13;

EDUCATIONAL AzND ECONOMIIC EFFECTS OF&#13;
PROMOTION AND REPETITION PRACTICUS&#13;
Scope of the Problem&#13;
1.        Wastage in the flow of a cohort of students in an educational&#13;
system is expressed quantitatively in terms of dropout and repetition.&#13;
Dropout is considered wasteful because of the investment of educational&#13;
services and economic resources in pupils who fail to complete a cycle,&#13;
particularly those who drop out before the minimum for permanent literacy&#13;
is achieved. It also contributes to under-utilization of-physical facili-&#13;
ties as a result of a decrease in class size in successive grades within a&#13;
cycle. Repetition is regarded as wasteful since repeaters stay in school&#13;
longer than the normal duration and thus reduce the intake capacity of the&#13;
corresponding grades and increase the education unit costs.&#13;
2.        Of the two components of educational wastage, repetition has the&#13;
greater impact for a number of reasons:   (a) Dropout may not be completely&#13;
wasteful if it is considered as an intermediary output with incremental&#13;
benefits in the socialization and mental development of dropouts; (b) Re-&#13;
petition contributes more to the economic inefficiency of an educational&#13;
system (para. 42). A study of repetition and dropout in primary educa-&#13;
tion in 21 countries by Brown (1966) followed by a report by the UNESCO&#13;
Regional Office for Education in Asia (1967) concluded that, in countries&#13;
with high wastage ratios, repetition contributes to wastage more than does&#13;
dropout:; (c) Repetition affects dropout. The Bangkok Report cited above&#13;
conclucles that repetition is followed by dropout. In an analysis of the&#13;
determinants of primary school dropouts in 42 less developed countries&#13;
* Research and documentation assistance was provided by Helen Adi and&#13;
Francisco Ruiz.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, it qas found that "the&#13;
only educational variable significantly related to the dropout rate ie the&#13;
average rate of repetition. A one percent increase in the average repetitiLon&#13;
rate is associated with an almost one percent increase in the cumulative&#13;
dropout rate." (Levy, 1971). The dropout rate3 were calculated net of&#13;
repeaters so that the two variables do not measure the came phenosnAon0&#13;
The study concludes that in the short run the most effective way to Teduce&#13;
dropout rates is the elimination or reduction of repetition. Likeuwise,&#13;
Schiefelbein (1975) shous that the "root cause of low retention in primry&#13;
education is repetition"'   Thomas and Knudsen (1965) reviewed the related&#13;
literature and concluded that non-promotion in the early years of schooling&#13;
leads to later uithdrawal from the educational system0 Furthermore, repeat-&#13;
ing a grade did not seem to help the child in mastering the academic skills&#13;
of that grade level   On the contrary, the anxiety about the child's academic&#13;
failure, which is usually expressed by parental pressureD creates at many&#13;
times problems of social and personal maladjustmntso The retained child&#13;
starts eventually to seek som recognition in areas that do not require&#13;
academic performance, and this in turn increases the likelihood of having&#13;
the retained child drop out of school. Thus, when school administrators&#13;
characterize a given student as a school failure, they are directing that&#13;
student out of the education system, and consequently they are adding to&#13;
the educational wastage. Both Kitch (1952) and Ellinger (1965) also reported&#13;
research evidence supporting the above results. Similarly, Stroup and Robins&#13;
(1972), investilting elezontory school predictors og high schcol dropout&#13;
among male students, found that school retardation at the primary level&#13;
is one of such predictors.&#13;
&#13;

3.        Developing countries suffer from high repetition rates, the extent&#13;
of which appears in Annex 1 which gives the rates for the first six grades&#13;
in a selected number of countries grouped by region. The range and mean of&#13;
repetition rates for each group of countries are shown in Table 1.&#13;
Table 1&#13;

West lfrica                      5-50         23.7          1-57        34.1&#13;
Asia                            14-74         29.0          2-27         8.7&#13;
Europe, M.E., and N. Africa&#13;
(EM1ENA)                      6-23          12.4         1-41        12.3&#13;
Latin America and Caribbean     15-33         21.4         2-14          5.5&#13;
Although no comparative inferences can be made due to the selectivity of&#13;
countries and variation in data dates, one can observe the wide range of&#13;
percentage repeaters, and the high rates that tend to decrease toward the&#13;
end of the cycle with the exception of West African and EMENA countries.&#13;
These results show the extent to which repetition is a limiting factor to&#13;
educat:Lonal opportunities. UNESCO, in its report to the 36th International&#13;
Conference on Education (1977), points out on the basis of repetition data&#13;
covering 68 percent of primary school enrollment in Africa, 78 percent in&#13;
South Asia and 94 percent in Latin America, that in 1970 "repeaters consti-&#13;
tuted about 15 percent of total enrollment in primary education in Latin&#13;
America, 15 percent in Africa and 18 percent in South Asia. In other words,&#13;
the number of children of primary school age admitted to school could have&#13;
been increased by some 15-20 percent this year in LDR, without increasing the&#13;
costs, had there been no repetition."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40        The magnitude of the impact of   epeAtition On Ochool outDt0 and&#13;
consequently efficiency, has been dmonstrated in a nabez of Otdiso       The&#13;
effect io coapounded by the pheanomenon of maulti-repetition by the same student&#13;
within a certain cycle. IBE (1972) reported a number of studies that retraced&#13;
the school careeg of pupils that coWleted the prTary cycle, io0e0 DECludina&#13;
dropoutso  The dsts reported in theae studies Eare utilized In this papeP to&#13;

and Niger (boys); 103 for Togo (boys) and Congo; and 104 for the Central&#13;
AfriEca Republic0 A similar study in Lebanon by Antoun and Abu-Rujeili&#13;
(1975) showed an index of Inefficiency of 112. Such inefficiency due to&#13;
repetition and the closely-related factor of dropout contributes to the high&#13;
cost of the educational systems0 especially in countries where financial&#13;
resources are very limitedo The results of the 1969 educational tastage&#13;
survey by Office of Statistics at UNESC0, as quoted by IBE (1971) showed&#13;
input/output ratios for countries in major regions as follows:&#13;
Africa             2000&#13;
Latin Ame2rica      1.90&#13;
Asia               1031&#13;
Europe              1.20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
"The above ratios shows that, in Africa for instance, the median 'cost' to&#13;
the system per successful completer was double the prescribed one. In other&#13;
words, only half of the cost was effective, since repetition and dropout&#13;
were responsible for the other half." Schiefelbein (1973) also estimated&#13;
the total amount of resources devoted to repeaters in the first grade in&#13;
Latin America to be more than $300 million per year. "Just a fraction of&#13;
this amount is more than all the foreign aid devoted to education in Latin&#13;
America."&#13;
5.         Repetition seems to have also a regressive effect on equity in&#13;
the educational system. This is seen from the socio-economic profiles of&#13;
repeaters. Studies by Buckman (1971) and Fischer (1971) clearly show that&#13;
the failure to promote students at a normal pace has the greatest effect on&#13;
students from low socio-economic levels. In addition an IBE survey showed&#13;
that the rate of repetition in six countries was significantly higher in&#13;
rural than urban areas (IBE, 1971).&#13;
Policies and Practices&#13;
6.         There are two major rubrics under which policies regarding dynamics&#13;
of student flow fall: repetition (retention), and automatic promotion.&#13;
However., the application of components of such policies generates a wide&#13;
spectrut of diversified systems.    Countries that systematically practice&#13;
repetition differ in terms of (a) criteria used for promotion, (b) the person&#13;
or body that is responsible for deciding on promotion, (c) the control of the&#13;
number of years that a pupil is permitted to be retained in a particular&#13;
grade, and (d) the academic treatment given to repeaters.    Similarly, appli-&#13;
cation of automatic promotion varies in terms of scope, justification and&#13;
remedial work that accompanies it.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7.        While the majority of countries practice systematic repetition,&#13;
automatic promotion has been introduced de lure in a number of countries&#13;
through government legislation, and de facto in some others where teachers&#13;
have been increasingly expected to reduce the number of repeaters. For&#13;
example, according to a study conducted by the Lawyers' Committee for Civil&#13;
Rights Under Law (1974) only 12 States in the U.S. had promotion requirements&#13;
set in statutes and/or regulations. Of these 12 States only 6 adopted quan-&#13;
tifiabLe criteria for promotion, such as minimum school attendance, passing&#13;
standardized tests, or other specific requirements. For instance, in Alabama&#13;
"a pupLl is promoted if he has progressed within the limits of his ability,"&#13;
and in Hawaii promotion is based on "performance in relation to a pupil's&#13;
ability."  The extent to which automatic promotion has been de lure or de&#13;
facto itntroduced in primary education in developed and developing countries&#13;
is expressed in Table II on the basis of recent data available from the&#13;
UNESCO Office of Statistics. It is expected that more countries will reassess&#13;
their retention policies in light of increasing discussions of this issue in&#13;
internaLtional meetings and reports, such as the annual UNESCO International&#13;
Conference of Education. The report of the Third Regional Conference of&#13;
Ministers of Education and Economic Planning in the Arab States reaffirmed in&#13;
1970 the recommendation of previous regional educational conferences concern-&#13;
ing the prohibition of repetition in the first four years of primary education&#13;
accompanied by measures to ensure the continuity of the pupil's progress&#13;
(Phillips, 1975).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Two Sidea of the It0ue&#13;
e.        The concept of grade retention or nloanprootiOn itN baeGd On pGedGigo&#13;
gical assumptions concerning the determinanto and outcoRs of echool learning0&#13;
It is aaoumedD first of all, that the determinants of achievement and failure&#13;
are basically academic. A study prograe cani be feasibly enpressed In the&#13;
form of one-year courses that take one year to teach and one year to be&#13;
learned by pupilo who have already mastered the previous courseo    The  ajozrity&#13;
of the pupils in a given grade are developme2ntally capable of learning the&#13;
required material at the miniERl rate uhile the teacher goes thgough the&#13;
syllabus (ID1Z i971)0 Therefore, failure of pupils to achieve at the required&#13;
level can be considered as a function of the tima spent in assimilating the&#13;
school e3periences. Secondly, it ls assumed that a teacher or ezaginez uses&#13;
igeasureent inotruments and techniques that are valid and reliable enough to&#13;
accurately determine a pupils level of trmowledge in comparison with the&#13;
required level needed to proceed to the nent grade level. It is, thirdlyD&#13;
aosum2d that certain concepts and skills can best be learned at a given Srede,&#13;
and a pupil who falls to learn them needs to repeat the year0s work in its&#13;
entiretyo Noreover, not all children mature at the same rate, and children&#13;
that mature slowly can profit by being given an entra year to grow (Thompson,&#13;
l976).   It is finally assumed that children are emotionally better off if&#13;
they are retained since continued inability to do the work at a certain level&#13;
is discouraging and frustrating0    Similarly, immature children will find more&#13;
suitable classmates when they repeat a grade.    (Jackson, 1975)o&#13;
9o         Proponents of repetition criticize automatic promotion on the&#13;
grounds that such a policy (a) destroys incentives to learn and teach,&#13;
(b) ignores individual differences, (c) lowers achievement standards of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
a class, and (d) leads to maladjustment of students because it fails to&#13;
provide the social concepts necessary for adequate participation within&#13;
a group (Smith, 1963). Meanwhile, it is claimed that a strict retention&#13;
policy Iaises scholastic standards, and pupil achievement, and at the same&#13;
time reduces the ability range with which the teacher has to deal within a&#13;
particular grade level.&#13;
10.       On the other hand, a policy of promotion as a better alternative&#13;
starts wlith a rejection of the pedagogical assumptions on which a repetition&#13;
policy is based. In other words, (a) the determinants of achievement are not&#13;
totally academic, and the desirable educational outcomes are not only cog-&#13;
nitive; (b) the criteria for the measurement of educational outcomes are&#13;
debatable and chronological age seems to be "the best single criterion for&#13;
determining the placement of a child with other children"; (c) repetition&#13;
does not improve the achievement of the low-achiever, nor does it reduce the&#13;
range of abilities, since each grade will carry the retained into the next&#13;
year as a source of a difference in ability; and (d) grade retention is&#13;
devastati.ng to the pupil's adjustment and self-concept.   (Jackson, 1975).&#13;
On the other hand, it is claimed (Goodlad, 1952) that promotion provides a&#13;
better treatment for the total development of the child in both the cognitive&#13;
processes (knowledge, understanding, application, analysis, etc....), and the&#13;
affective domain (attitudes, emotions, values, etc....)&#13;

The procedure included a computer search of ERIC, a wide utilizatlon of the&#13;
Education Index and other reference documento, a survey of previous reviewEB&#13;
and a study of policy and statistical publications. DEZot of the relevant&#13;
research was found to be!, as expected!, related to the U.S. and other developed&#13;
countries, although special efforts were made to locate research studies&#13;
pertaining to developing countries. The significance of the review&#13;
tr;anscends these geographic imbalances in the data base!, because of the gene-&#13;
rality of the conceptual issues investtgated and the relative transferability&#13;
of the results of the controlled experiments. Further research is, homever,&#13;
needed to test the applicability of the conclusions to diverse settings in&#13;
developing countries0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
Factors Affecting Achievement and Failure&#13;
12.       Promotion policies presume a definition of success and failure&#13;
mainly in terms of cognitive achievement, assuming that such an achievement&#13;
is a good predictor of further scholastic success and perhaps of later life&#13;
success. Recent evidence raises serious questions regarding the narrowness&#13;
of this; approach as it indicates a low correlation between cognitive achieve-&#13;
ment arnd later life success (Cohn, 1968 and Holtzman, 1971), and a strong&#13;
influence of noncognitive achievement on later productivity (Gintis, 1971).&#13;
Along the same lines, McClelland (1973) reports that "researchers have in&#13;
fact had great difficulty demonstrating that grades in school are related&#13;
to any Other behaviors of importance", and that a committee of the Social&#13;
Science Research Council which he was chairing "concluded that while grade&#13;
level attained seemed related to future measures of success in life, perform-&#13;
ance within a grade was related only slightly". Berg (1970) also summarized&#13;
studies showing that neither amount of education nor grades in school are&#13;
related to vocational success in a number of jobs.&#13;
13.       Even when success is conceived in terms of achievement, two major&#13;
questions remain to be asked: (a) What are the factors that affect achieve-&#13;
ment and, consequently, relate to the causes of failure? and (b) Are promotion&#13;
practices relevant to these factors? A revLew of research concerned with&#13;
cognitive and noncognitive factors (Asbury, 1974) indicated clearly that&#13;
achievement is influenced by noncognitive variables such as socio-economic&#13;
status, child rearing, family size and education of parents, as much as by&#13;
cognitive variables such as intelligence and cognitive environment. Alexander&#13;
and Simmons (1975) attempted to identify schooling inputs that have a signifi-&#13;
cant impact on cognitive achievement of students in developing countries by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 °&#13;
reviewing a number of research projects and using the educational producticon&#13;
function (EPP) as an analytical tool for this puYpoceo They reported that&#13;
°°ochooling inputs do have an effect on academic achievement, a1though, for&#13;
many school-related variables tested, it is either weak or statietically lin-&#13;
significent0   Furthermore, the impact of any significant policy-controlled&#13;
schooling variables will almost certainly be very small in relation to the&#13;
oth2r determinants of student performance, such as home backgroud and&#13;
individual personality."0 The moot extensive study to identify determinants&#13;
of achievement was conducted by The International Association for the Evalum-&#13;
tion of Educational Achievement0 Achievement in science (Comber and 1ceevea ,&#13;
1973) and reading (Thorndike, 1973) by ten-year-old pupils are considered&#13;
here0 The magnitude of the effect of different variables shown by their&#13;
contribution to the explanation of total variance of achievement scores varies&#13;
with subjects and countries. While the contribution of home circumstances and&#13;
background is about 14 percent in reading0, it is about 10 percent in science0&#13;
In contrast0, although the explanatory power of the learning conditions is&#13;
relatively small, its value for science (8 percent) is twice that for reading&#13;
(4 percent)0   Similarly, in developing countries there is a relatively greater&#13;
role of schooling variables and smaller role of home background than in&#13;
developed countries0    Averch et al. (1974) after a critical review of input-&#13;
output studies concluded the following:&#13;
"When we examine the results across studies we find that school&#13;
resources are not consistently important.    The particular&#13;
resources that seem to be significant in one study do not prove&#13;
to be significant in other studies that include the same&#13;
resources in the analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Background factors, on the other hand, are always important.&#13;
In study after study a student's background has a strong influence&#13;
cn his educational outcomes. Furthermore, the results are con-&#13;
sistent across studies. The socio-economic status of a student's&#13;
family - his parents' income, education, and occupation - invariably&#13;
proves to be a significant predictor of his educational outcome."&#13;
14.       In a more specific manner, a number of studies dealt directly with&#13;
the factors affecting failure and/or repetition. Causes of repetition in&#13;
the lower primary grades were investigated in a study conducted in a semi-&#13;
rural semi-urban region in France in 1970 and reported by IBE (1971). Two&#13;
kinds of causes were identified, material and psychological, as detailed&#13;
below:&#13;
Material causes                                                 Percent&#13;
Repetition due to:   Overcrowded classes                          17.8&#13;
Lack of preparatory year                     10.0&#13;
Absence from school (14 days to&#13;
2 months); an overburdened&#13;
teacher being unable to help&#13;
pupils catch up                            27.0&#13;
Too many changes from one school to&#13;
another                                    14.2&#13;
Too many changes of teacher within the&#13;
same school                                20.2&#13;
(Certain categories overlap)&#13;
Psychological causes&#13;
Rep,etition due to:  The fact that a pupil with too low&#13;
an IQ was not placed in a special&#13;
school at the start                        31.0&#13;
The pupil coming from an immigrant&#13;
family                                     18.8&#13;
The family background                        16.8&#13;
Fatigue and various other factors            14.6&#13;
Saunders also lists the causes of nonpromotion of elementary school children&#13;
reported in various research studies (Annex II).     They include insufficient&#13;
achievement or attendance, imperfect health, emotional instability, out-of-&#13;
school causes and inappropriate administrative practices.&#13;

as a fleuibleD plastic dimenaion!, subject to modifications by such socisl&#13;
factors, will lead to both greater flexibility and equality of opportunity&#13;
for each student."&#13;
16.       Psychological factors were also reported to be associated with&#13;
school failure. Studies by Bassi (1965)D, Uaiser (1966), Kirchoff (1965),&#13;
Stienlet (1964), Geller (1965) and Gutierrez (1965) that were reported in the&#13;
IBE survey (1971) revealed that the child's sense of security and his early&#13;
experiences of success and failure are frequently found to be related to low&#13;
achievement, repetition and dropout.&#13;
170       The relationship between failure and the teaching-learning environ-&#13;
ment was also the subject of some studies. Kowitz and Armstrong (1961)&#13;
presented evidence to show that school policy has a material effect on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
achievement of its students. A Polish author, Kupisiewicz (IBE, 1971),&#13;
analyzed factors in the organization, content and methodology of education&#13;
which may cause failure, and concluded that "a large proportion of dropout&#13;
and repetition could be avoided if teachers had a better knowledge of the&#13;
techniques of educational science and paid more attention to the pupils'&#13;
personalities and to maintaining individual contacts with them." McClelland&#13;
(1972) investigated the hypothesis that unmotivated children are low achievers&#13;
and indicated that achievement motivation training improved the academic&#13;
performance of students. Similarly, Glasser (1969) concluded that the key to&#13;
school success is motivation through involvement, on the basis of which he&#13;
established the system of Schools Without Failure (SWF). Steadman (1959)&#13;
submitted the records of 15 once-retained children to a panel of eight judges&#13;
to evaluate their promotion-retention status, and all judges agreed that&#13;
these children had a short attention span. School non-attendance has also&#13;
been shown to be related to poor achievement (Tennent, 1971). Bloom (1964)&#13;
considers general school achievement as a relatively stable characteristic&#13;
that develops quickly during the early school years, and the inadequate&#13;
intellectual development of students may be attributed in part to inappro-&#13;
priate schooling programs.&#13;
18.       These results indicate that promotion policies based on the academic&#13;
performance of a pupil fail to consider the wide complex of the interactive&#13;
variables in the educational process. Academic performance is only one&#13;
component: of the learning process which is one of many elements of the school&#13;
environment which is one of many determinants of achievement which is the&#13;
least to say, one of many predictors of future success. Within this struc-&#13;
ture, repetition, even in an ideal case where a pupil is successfully re-&#13;
exposed to the same body of knowledge and given another full year to assimilate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
° 16 =&#13;
this Iouoledge uitbout any aide effects, tends to use the same tr@   Xent that&#13;
reoulted in low achievemeat without conaidering the other detersinantos&#13;
Similarly, automatic promaotion, unaccompanied by supplementery action, al-&#13;
though not panalizing a pupil for a low achievement, fails to improve ths&#13;
conditiono for success.&#13;
Criteria for Promotion&#13;
19.       Pro2otion decisions are, by and large, dependent upon the avail-&#13;
Mbility of valid measures to establish the "pass" level and/or the proportion&#13;
of pupils io shall be allowed to be promoted to the nest grade0    A survey of&#13;
regulations governing promotion (IBE, 1971) confirmed the well-knoun fact that&#13;
countries practicing repetition rely on either reports given by teachers in&#13;
t h  courcm of the year, or end-of-year etaminations, or a combination of both.&#13;
khiO systes of measurement has waaknesses in its coverage, nature, and&#13;
implamentation.&#13;
200        Teses prepared by classroom teachers and examining boards or stan-&#13;
dardized tests used for promotion purposes, generally measure factual kncouledge&#13;
of information, occasionally understanding and application of knowledge, but&#13;
rarely high cognitive processes such as abstract reasoning, creativity and&#13;
problem-solving. Noreover, such tests ignore effective and social goals of&#13;
education, which are considered a major ccmponent of educational objectives0&#13;
For instance a UNESCO Meeting of Experts on Curriculum for the first stage of&#13;
Education identified general objectives for primary level in developing&#13;
countries in terms of (a) learning to learn, (b) communication, (c) values of&#13;
society, (d) personality development, (e) participation in a variety of&#13;
activities, and (f) health and hygiene. (Hawes, 1972). A major recommenda-&#13;
tion of the Commission on Primary Education for the 1968 Conference on E.duca-&#13;
tion in Nairobi w;as that African governments should ensure that primary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
education contribute to national unity, social and cultural integration of&#13;
children in the community, and change and economic and social development&#13;
(Kiros et al, 1975). Similarly, El-Koussy (1973) states that the objectives&#13;
of education for the Arab World need to be "to produce citizens who are&#13;
...rescurceful, adaptable, adaptive, responsible, realistic, efficient,&#13;
enthusiastic, effective, and conscious of their problems and the way out of&#13;
them." In addition there is experimental evidence supporting the view that&#13;
"generalization of cognitive ability results not only from the transfer of&#13;
specific skill but also from the effects of such noncognitive factors as the&#13;
establishment of learning styles, learning sets, motivation for learning and&#13;
attitudeBs about learning." (Averch et al., 1974). Therefore tests, even when&#13;
properly used and interpreted, measure a very limited number of educational&#13;
outcomes, and consequently their results do not justify the determination of&#13;
educational success and failure.&#13;
21.        Even within the limited domain of cognitive achievement there is a&#13;
number of liabilities and hazards in the very nature of testing. The major&#13;
issue is test validity, i.e., "Do the tests on which promotion decisions are&#13;
made, measure what they are supposed to measure?" Studies have shown that&#13;
teacher-made tests are extremely inconsistent, and teachers do not correlate&#13;
with each other in grades assigned to same students. (Cronbach, 1970).&#13;
"Teacher grades are greatly influenced by student characteristics not asso-&#13;
ciated with cognitive performance".    (Averch, et al., 1974).   Standardized&#13;
tests also, which have limited use in developing countries, fail the critetion&#13;
of validity.   Klein (1971) points out several cases in which test items do not&#13;
contribute to what the test claims to measure, and Bormuth (1970) indicates&#13;
that the item generation techniques employed lead to tests of low validity.&#13;

learned (Rist, 1970) and is thuo only incidentally related to learning (Kohl,&#13;
1967)o&#13;
22.       The problem is further compounded by the wellk4nown and bitter&#13;
facts about the conventional administration and use of egaminationso Tests&#13;
are usually constructed in a non-structured fashionD weighted haphazardly,&#13;
and corrected under pressure of time and fluid criteria. The Shole atmosphere&#13;
is that of strain and fear which drives parents and pupils to try to do&#13;
anything to pass the examination. Woreover, the results are interpreted to&#13;
reflect student performance with no reference to school conditionsD teacher&#13;
effectiveness or appropriateneses of curricula.&#13;

conferences have shotn that there is not a single psychologist or educationist&#13;

Comparative Effects of Promotion Practices on Achievement&#13;
24.       A large number of studies have been conducted to test the effects&#13;
of promotion practices on achievement, scholastic standards and class homo-&#13;
geneity'. Some of these studies attempted to test the assumption that repeti-&#13;
tion of a grade significantly increases the achievement level of the repeater.&#13;
The results of a survey conducted by the Bangkok Institute for Child Study in&#13;
1966 of 25,000 school children concluded that repetition of grades appeared&#13;
to hold no advantage in raising achievement levels (Phillips, 1975). Reinherz&#13;
and GrifEfin (1971) found also that retention in the earlier grades did not&#13;
improve achievement or progress scores of repeaters. Similar results were&#13;
reportecl by Coffield and Bloomers (1956) and Briggs (1966). Other studies&#13;
(for example, Allison, 1959; Lodbell, 1954; Steadman, 1959; Kowitz and&#13;
Armstrong, 1961) support the view that retention improves school achievement.&#13;
The conflict in results arises from the designs of these studies that fail&#13;
to compare the effects of grade retention with those of promotion, and there-&#13;
fore, do not give any indication of how well the same retained children would&#13;
have done had they been promoted, or how promoted pupils would have achieved&#13;
had they been retained.&#13;
25.       To avoid this weakness, several researchers studied the comparative&#13;
effects of retention and promotion either by comparing classes operating under&#13;
the two schemes or by studying matched groups of pupils some of whom were&#13;
arbitrarily promoted while others were retained. Saunders (1941) reviewed&#13;
early studies of this kind and reached the following conclusion: "Children&#13;
do not appear to learn more by repeating a grade but experience a less growth&#13;
in subject-matter achievement than they do when promoted." Kamii and Weikart&#13;
(1963) investigated the effect of non-promotion on the achievement levels of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
thooe who were retained. The sample conoioted of 31 cventh :aTdero Who had&#13;
been retained only once in their elementary school education, and an equal&#13;
number of comparable seventh graders who had not been retained at all. Sco'oo&#13;
of intelligence and achievement of the retained group were conciAtently lower&#13;
than the respective scores of the regularly promoted childreno Oa the whole,&#13;
the retained group achieved less in seven years than what the regularly pro-&#13;
moted group achieved in six years. Chansky (1964) in order to study whether&#13;
retention accomplishes its aim of increasing achievement levelsD promoted, a&#13;
sample of 30 children to grade 2 while 33 other children were retained in&#13;
grade 10 All children were pre- and post-tested on vocabulary, reading come&#13;
prehension, and arithmetic achievement0 The promoted group had significantly&#13;
greater gains than did the retained group0 No differences in arithmetic&#13;
achievement gains were detected between the two groups0 Initially both groups&#13;
had been classified as slow learners0 and by the end of the experiment both&#13;
groups were still underachievers0 Dobbs and Ileville (1967) also investigated&#13;
the effects of non-promotion on the achievement of once-retained first gradero&#13;
as compared to never-retained second graders0 Thirty pairs of children were&#13;
matched by race, sex, socio-economic level, type of classroom assignment, age,&#13;
mental ability, and reading achievement0     The analysis of variance, using&#13;
three reading and three arithmetic scores, showed that in both cases the&#13;
achievement of the promoted group was significantly greater than that of the&#13;
retained group0    The long- and short-term effects of first and second grade&#13;
retention were examined in a study conducted in an urban school of approx-&#13;
imately 7,000 students in the U.S. (Abidin, Golladay, and Howerton, 1971).&#13;
The sample consisted of all promoted and retained sixth graders, and the&#13;
data included measures of academic achievement. The retained group's marks&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
in readlng and in mathematics were significantly lower the year they were&#13;
retained than in the previous year. The long-term effects of retention&#13;
displayed a continuing deterioration in both achievement and intelligence&#13;
scores through the sixth grade. Koons (1977) also reported that regularly&#13;
promoted low-achieving pupils scored higher on achievement tests than other&#13;
similar retained pupils after they had spent a year in a given grade. Similar&#13;
results were reported by Boyle (1962) who had reviewed the related literature&#13;
and concluded that non-promoted children tended to make poor progress, and&#13;
that they did less well than slow learners who were promoted.&#13;
26.       Jackson (1975) identified three studies by Cook (1941), Farley&#13;
(1936) and Klene and Branson (1929) that used an experimental design to&#13;
investigate the effects of the retention and promotion treatments. He then&#13;
isolated all the tested statistical relationships between a condition of&#13;
grade promotion or retention and academic achievement. The results of the!,&#13;
analyses are shown in Table III. Jackson, on the basis of these studies and&#13;
27 others that compared the outcomes of retained students before and after&#13;
retention, or in comparison with students promoted under normal policies,&#13;
concluded that "there is no reliable body of evidence to indicate that grade&#13;
retention is more beneficial than grade promotion for students with serious&#13;
academic or adjustment difficulties."&#13;

27.       A number of studies also shoved that repetition does not remedy the&#13;
problem of lou achievement and9 consequently, does not contribute to future&#13;
improvement. In a study of academic achievement in Tuniaia9 Simmons and Askoy&#13;
(1972) found that the number of grades repeated at school had a significant and&#13;
negative effect on achievement, ioe., "9repeated failure at school can have a&#13;
disincentive effect on learningo" Carnoy and Thias (1974) also in egamining&#13;
the determinants of achievement at the secondary level in Tunisia, found that&#13;
one of the variables consistently significant across most grades of secondary&#13;
schools (with a negative effect) was years repeated at primary school.&#13;
Similarly, Fuller and Chantavanich found in Thailand that non-repetition is&#13;
one of the most important variables influencing scholastic achievement on&#13;
the national level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
28.       The hypothesis that achievement standards are better maintained&#13;
under conditions of non-promotion practices was the subject of some studies.&#13;
Coffield and Bloomers (1956) found non-promotion was more likely to lower&#13;
standards than to raise them. A longitudinal study by Hall and Demarest&#13;
(1958) oE the performance of 20,000 children over a period of ten years&#13;
revealed that regular promotion which kept children with their own age group&#13;
did not result in lowering academic achievement. In evaluating the threat of&#13;
failure on pupils' academic achievement, Smith (1963) reviewed the literature&#13;
and reported that (a) children who were told at the beginning of the semester&#13;
that they would all be promoted did as well on a comprehensive achievement&#13;
test at the end of the semester as did children who throughout the semester&#13;
were continually reminded that they had to do well in order to be promoted,&#13;
and (b) upon a ten years observation of the fourth and sixth graders of a&#13;
school district, it was noticed that an automatic promotion policy did not&#13;
result in lowering academic achievement levels. Otto and Melby (1935) also&#13;
conducted a study with pupils of 18 classrooms in northern Illinois to study&#13;
the threat: of failure in elementary education. The experimental group was&#13;
told at the beginning of the semester that they would all be promoted to the&#13;
higher grade the following term. The control group was told at the beginning&#13;
of the semester and several times during the semester that anyone who did&#13;
not achieve well had to repeat the grade. Results revealed no significant&#13;
difference between the achievement levels of the two groups at the end of&#13;
the term. In Malaysia, after automatic promotion was introduced, teachers&#13;
were asked to report the percentage of students not deserving to be promoted.&#13;
The average repetition rate suggested was 10 percent which was much lower than&#13;
the actual rate when retention was practiced. (Report of Malaysia, 1966)&#13;
&#13;

290       A number of etudies indicated that non-prormotion doeo not contributa&#13;
to a reduction in the range of abilitiao within echool aradae0 Uorth (1T50)&#13;
reported that a etudy in California showed that the uniformity of instructiogal&#13;
groups in upper grades was not maintained by non-promotion in the primary&#13;
grades. This result is in agreement with earlier studieo such as that of&#13;
ceueall (1933) who indicated that if all over-ageness were imsedistely eal.i-&#13;
nated by reorganizing students into groups as if they had been regularly&#13;
promoted, the average achievement and variability of mental age of each claos&#13;
would be little affected. Moreover, a study of the flow of a cohort of xsp$X2&#13;
in a system practicing nonpromotion, clearly shows that after rep2aters &amp;a&amp;&#13;
left behind at each grade level new repeaters appear at each consecutive pear,&#13;
For example, the history of a reconstructed cohort in Lebanon (Antoun and&#13;
Abu-Rujeili, 1975) shows that after 19 percent of the cohort entering fizcQ&#13;
grade are left behind as repeaters, 21 percent of those promoted to secosd&#13;
grade repeat. Another 21 percent of those that make it to the third grad&amp;&#13;
repeat, and further 21 percent repeat the fourth grade, 12 percent the fifth&#13;
grade and 11 percent the sixth grade. In other words, repetition in the early&#13;
grades does not screen low-achievers, but a rather significant proportion of&#13;
new repeaters appears in later grades0&#13;

Comparative Effects of Promotion Practice on Personal-Social Adjustment&#13;
30.       Along with research investigating the cognitive effects of the&#13;
different promotion practices, a number of studies have been directed to&#13;
the social and adjustment effects. Leviton (1975), on the basis of a&#13;
review of literature focussing on self-concept and achievement, found&#13;
that "research evidence seems to support the position of a relationship&#13;
between self-concept and academic achievement." White and Howard (1973)&#13;
studied the relationship between the failure to be promoted and the de-&#13;
velopment of a negative self-concept among a sample of 624 sixth graders&#13;
in North Carolina. Subjects were classified according to the number of&#13;
times they had to repeat a grade, and the dependent variable consisted of&#13;
their performance scores on a self-concept scale. Analysis of the data&#13;
indicated that failure to be promoted was associated with a negative self-&#13;
concept of the elementary school children. Berry (1974) compared two matched&#13;
samples of an at-least-once-retained group versus regularly promoted students.&#13;
All students were selected from an urban school district. All 160 students&#13;
were given an intelligence test and a check list to assess their self-concept&#13;
and need variables. The data indicated that on all of the self-concept vari-&#13;
ables, with the exception of self-confidence and self-control, there were&#13;
significant differences between the two groups with the promoted students&#13;
measuring higher on the variables related to positive self-esteem. Chase&#13;
(1968), on the other hand, examined the effects of grade retention on a group&#13;
of elementary school children who were retained in their grade level because&#13;
they were judged to be emotionally and socially less mature than other&#13;
children. The sample consisted of 65 children who were enrolled in ten&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 =&#13;
schools in ColumbusD Ohio. The results indicated that zpetitio       of a    de&#13;
engenders no negative cocial or emotional effecto in the child whoce ochaol&#13;
failure was based primarily on social and eotional Saturity for ths 3E@e&#13;
in which he had been placed.&#13;

consequence of school tracking as a result of low academic achievanernt (Mally,&#13;
1975)0&#13;
32.       Goodlad (1954) investigated the parsonal and social adjuotment&#13;
effects of non-promotion of elementary school children. Two matched samples&#13;
of promoted and retained children were selected for the study from eleven&#13;
elementary schoolso The California Test of Personality was administered to&#13;

clusion that differences in peer-group relationships favored the promoted&#13;

group. Of the retained group, some were worried over their school progress,&#13;
others were insecure in their home relationships, and certain children were&#13;
having difficulty in balancing between experiences of success and failure.&#13;
33.       Repetition of a grade causes attitudinal changes in pupils and&#13;
parents. Russell (1952) investigated the influence of repetition of a&#13;
grade on the attitudes of the retained children and their parents toward&#13;
school. The sample was seleced from suburban schools in central and northern&#13;
California. Fifth and eighth grade students and their parents participated&#13;
in the study by responding to questionnaires. The results indicated that&#13;
(a) the retained children, more than the promoted children, have positive&#13;
attitudes toward out-of-school activities, and (b) both retained students&#13;
and their parents expressed less favorable attitudes toward school than did&#13;
regularly promoted pupils and their parents. Glasser (1969) who rejects "the&#13;
philosophy in which children are taught how to succeed by failing them",&#13;
questions the advantage, if any, of making 7-to-11 year olds convinced that&#13;
they are failures, especially when the criteria of non-promotion is so&#13;
unreliable.&#13;

multi-dimensional interactive matrin of variables that describe the dynanics&#13;
of success and failure (Figure 1)o In specific, the follouing conclusions&#13;
can be made:&#13;
(a) Achievement is influenced by a variety of school-related and&#13;
out-of-school factors. While school-related variables are weak and&#13;
not consistently important, out-of-school variables and personal&#13;
pupil characteristics are consistently significant predictors of&#13;
achievement. Similarly, failure is caused by factors in the school&#13;
environment, such as school policy9 programs and teachers9 as yell&#13;
as by the pupil's socioeconomic background, and his personal charac-&#13;
teristics and psychological structure.&#13;

37.       "To promote or not promote," therefore, is not the question.    The&#13;
real issue is how to improve the level of low achievers, and ultimately how&#13;
to prevent failure. The original objectives hoped to be fulfilled by repet-i-&#13;
tion, namely, achievement, motivation, improved grade homogeneity, high&#13;
academic standards, etc. are still valid educational concerns that need to be&#13;
tackled by the development of an educational strategy based on a new set of&#13;
assumptions derived from available research evidence.&#13;
38.       The first element in such a strategy is a re-definition of cur-&#13;
riculum in terms of schooling years. The division of the teaching/learning&#13;
process into units of one year duration called grades that have to be passed&#13;
in bulk is an arbitrary decision. Since learning is a continuous process&#13;
and does not occur in discrete steps, it is more realistic to break the&#13;
curriculum into smaller units approaching a continuum. Then threshold levels&#13;
of achievement may be defined in a sequential pattern, the feedback circuit&#13;
will be short and manageable, and repetition, if necessary, becomes purposeful&#13;
and efficient. Structurally, this strategy leads to the concept of non-graded&#13;
curriculum. A number of studies investigating the effects of non-gradedness&#13;
on achievement revealed consistently that non-graded programs were more&#13;
beneficial in terms of pupil attainment than graded programs. (Morris et al.,&#13;
1971; Brody, 1970; Ramayya, 1972; Engel and Cooper, 1971).&#13;
39.       The second compoient in this strategy accommodates the fact that&#13;
achievement is not solely dependent upon the exposure of a pupil to a set&#13;
of school experiences but is highly determined by background characteristics&#13;
of the learners. This implies that different learners need different amounts&#13;
of time to achieve a constant degree of learning. Moreover, the degree of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32 -&#13;
efQ£ctivGneco of teaching mathods influenceo the amount of time needed to&#13;
learn a concepto On the basis of Carroll's model (1963) that&#13;
,time actually spent&#13;
Degree of learning = f v     ttime needed&#13;
it can be seen that the attainment of a certain level of achievement requires&#13;
different actual amounts of time from different types of learners and under&#13;
different teaching conditions. Bugelski (1962) in studying presentative time&#13;
per trial in relation to total learning time concluded that time, rather than&#13;
the number of trials, is a significant variable. Jester and Travers (1967)&#13;
found also that a second presentation hardly results in any gain in compre-&#13;
hension, and that maximum learning occurs when the rate of presentation&#13;
approaches the optimum rate required by the learner. Similarly, Kress and&#13;
Gropper (1966) found that the best student performance takes place when&#13;
characteristically fast pupils work under a fast fined tempo, and characteris-&#13;
tically slow pupils tork under a slu fined tempo. In addition Rodgers (1968&#13;
and 1969) showed that instructional methods affect learning rates,, in the&#13;
sense that "pupils with different operative rate patterns will show different&#13;
achievement outcomes when exposed to different modes of presentation." This&#13;
implies a policy of a differential tempo of teaching for pupils with differ-&#13;
ent ranges of ability. If wa assume that levels of achievement through the&#13;
primary cycle could be predicted with a reasonable degree of accuracy in&#13;
the first grade, as shown by Payne (1964), then students may be grouped by&#13;
characteristic rates of learning (in a flexible manner) and taught with&#13;
different tempos. In other words1, for most pupils the primary curriculum&#13;
will spread over an average period of six years, fQr a small percentage it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
will spread over 4-5 years and for another small percentage it will extend&#13;
over a period of 7-8 years. In such a case the inefficiency index as defined&#13;
in para. 4 will remain close to 1. A number of studies have shown that such&#13;
an approach is effective in aiding low achievers. (Hall and Findley, 1971;&#13;
Cotter, 1967; Estes, 1973)&#13;
40.       This strategy calls for a new role for educational measurement&#13;
based on a broad and well defined spectrum of educational objectives covering&#13;
the cognitive, affective and social dimensions. Consequently, different&#13;
measurement techniques need to be developed to correspond to these domains.&#13;
The results will then be used not so much as to determine the fate of the&#13;
pupil but rather to estimate the rate of learning, and diagnose the effec-&#13;
tiveness of instructional methods and the appropriateness of materials, with&#13;
a feedback mechanism to introduce improvements wherever needed.&#13;
41.       It is however recognized that many national educational authorities&#13;
will continue to adhere to an educational framework of graded curricula and&#13;
single-tracked structures, and to a system of selection and promotion governed&#13;
by examinations and marks. While maintaining such an educational policy, a&#13;
number of improvements can be introduced:&#13;
(a) Promotion policies need to be carefully examined, and wherever&#13;
repetition rates are unreasonably high they may be reduced to a&#13;
small fixed percentage particularly in the early grades of the&#13;
primary cycle. This can be achieved either by controlling entrance&#13;
to each level or by modifying the promotion standards (which are&#13;
set arbitrarily anyway) to reflect the actual abilities of the&#13;
pupils. This does not necessarily mean a lowering of attainment&#13;
standards. "Age averages of attainment, however, appear to have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
riEen over the past two decade in ouch boaic soills ac readina,,&#13;
in those countries that have been developing an almost automatic&#13;
system of promotion in the primary school." (IDE, 1971)&#13;
(b) Repeaters may be grouped in a special program with appropriate&#13;
curriculum and instructional materials and msthodso Such an&#13;
approach is reported by Bundarnyj (1966) and quoted by IDE (1971)&#13;
in which experimental classes ware opened for repeaters In Wooscs&#13;
and Leningrado An attempt was made to introduce the material of&#13;
the nezt grade while proceeding with the remedial work of the&#13;
repeated grade. "The study argued that a conditional transfer of&#13;
a weak pupil to the next grade might be justified if help ware&#13;
given by the teacher and the other pupils to bring studies up to&#13;
standard .&#13;
(c) Since the quality of the school environment is a factor in achieve-&#13;
ment, any improvement in this domain tends to reduce repetitioniO&#13;
For instance, Jamison (1977) found that exposure to a mathemat:Lcs&#13;
radio program in Nicaragua more than compensated for a pupil's&#13;
socio-economic background and decreased the probability of failure.&#13;
Undoubtedly the decisive element is appropriate training of teachers&#13;
since conventional training programs have produced teachers that "do&#13;
not accept responsibility even for the failure of normal children"90&#13;
(Schiefelbein, 1975)o Training programs need to enhance an aware-&#13;
ness in the teachers of the pupils' social, personal and cognitive&#13;
adjustment to the educational environment, a professional senEsing&#13;
of the weakness of pupils, and a competence in evaluation for&#13;
diagnostic purposes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Economic Implications&#13;
42.       A reduction in repetition rate and consequently, dropout rate,&#13;
leads to a comparable reduction in wastage ratio and consequently costs per&#13;
graduate. Annex III (Table 1) taken from a study by UNESCO (Berstecher,&#13;
1970) shows how a joint reduction of both repetition and dropout rates leads&#13;
to a considerable reduction in costs. The final costs are however affected&#13;
by cost implications of the remedial measures taken to reduce wastage. The&#13;
UNESCO simulation model considered the economic inplications of three types&#13;
of strategies:&#13;
(a) A cost-neutral strategy includes such measures as automatic promo-&#13;
tion, revision of examination standards, selective lowering of&#13;
standards, redistribution of teachers to entrance grades, etc ....&#13;
The cost implications appear in Table 1 of Annex III.&#13;
(b)  A medium-cost strategy includes complementary non-graded forms of&#13;
instruction, more and better teaching materials, curriculum revi-&#13;
sion, better health services, etc... The costs implied in this&#13;
strategy are not very high, since even a 100% increase in these&#13;
expenditures will hardly affect the primary education budget.&#13;
Cost implications appear in Table 2 of Annex III where it can be&#13;
seen that even with a 32% increase in annual unit cost, costs per&#13;
graduate decrease to 63%.&#13;
(c)  A cost-intensive strategy consists of measures that involve major&#13;
structural changes in which the annual unit cost is assumed to be&#13;
increased by a maximum of 64% (Table 3 of Annex III). Even under&#13;
this strategy, there is a considerable reduction in costs per&#13;
graduate with a lower limit of 78%.&#13;

            Educational and economic effects on
            promotion and repetition practices

            This paper presents policies, practices
            and problems of student flow, and related research findings
            to the questions: What are the determinants of achievement
            and their implications for promotion practices? How valid
            are the criteria used in promotion decisions? What are the
            comparative effects of promotion practices on the
            achievement and personality of pupils? What are the other
            educational options to deal with failure and low
            achievement? On the basis of the studies reviewed, it was
            concluded that: (a) the dynamics of success and failure can
            best be represented by a multidimensional interactive matrix
            of school-related and out-of-school variables; (b) promotion
            decisions are based on unreliable measures of academic
            performance and ignore affective and social goals of
            education; (c) there is no evidence that repetition is more
            effective than promotion, or that repetition practices
            improve academic standards and class homogeneity; and (d)
            grade retention has certain negative effects on a
            pupil's self-concept and attitude.
