Project&#13;
Objectives:         The proposed Project would: (a) strengthen the MOE's capacity to coordinate and&#13;
implement environmental project; (b) reduce discharge of partially treated or&#13;
untreated wastewater to the Baltic Sea; (c) restore and enhance the water quality&#13;
in Haapsalu and Matsalu Bays; (d) improve water supply and sanitation services&#13;
in Haapsalu; (e) improve the operational efficiency and management systems of&#13;
the Haapsalu Water Works (HWW); (f) promote management of point and non-&#13;
point source pollution from the catchment area of Matsalu Bay; and (g) promote&#13;
environmentally sustainable management and development of the Matsalu Bay&#13;
and its catchment area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Project&#13;
Description:         The proposed Project would be implemented over four years as an environmental&#13;
management project for the coastal area of western Estonia. It would consist of&#13;
a Water and Wastewater Improvement Component (WWIC) and an&#13;
Environmental Management Component (EMC). The WWIC would consist of:&#13;
(a) rehabilitation and expansion of the Haapsalu water and wastewater system,&#13;
including equipment and works along with engineering services; and&#13;
(b) institutional strengthening and training to assist in establishing an autonomous&#13;
and financially independent water and wastewater utility in Haapsalu. This would&#13;
include assistance for tariff restructuring/tariff planning and financial operations.&#13;
The EMC would consist of: (a) technical and financial support through the MOE&#13;
for the implementation of selected elements of the Management Plan for Matsalu&#13;
State Nature Reserve by coordinating and providing funding for identified&#13;
investments such as access roads, observation towers, information boards etc.;&#13;
(b) design and implementation of a program of cost-effective activities to reduce&#13;
point and non-point source pollution of Matsalu Bay from small settlements and&#13;
agriculture; and (c) support for planning and management of eco-tourism.&#13;
Project Benefits:    The benefits of the WWIC would include: (a) improvements in water quality&#13;
through reduction of leakages of wastewater into the groundwater and reduction&#13;
in discharges of untreated and partially treated wastewater, thereby improving&#13;
water quality in Haapsalu Bay, providing protection for the curative mud deposits&#13;
and allowing for recreational use of the waters; (b) reductions in operating costs&#13;
and maintenance requirements in the water and wastewater systems; and&#13;
(c) improvement in the quality and reliability of the services through&#13;
establishment of an autonomous water and wastewater utility. The benefits of the&#13;
EMC would include: (a) strengthened overall project coordination capacity in the&#13;
MOE; (b) support for MOE's efforts to decentralize project management and&#13;
implementation to local authorities; (c) expanded recreational use of beaches and&#13;
waters around Matsalu Bay through reducing pollution; (d) upgrading of&#13;
environmental management of the Matsalu State Nature Reserve; (e) provision&#13;
of a basis for a long-term program to control non-point sources of pollution&#13;
affecting Matsalu Bay; and (f) expanding the opportunities for environmentally&#13;
sound tourism in western Estonia.&#13;
Environmental&#13;
Aspects:            Implementation of the proposed Project would have positive environmental&#13;
benefits through: (a) reduction of untreated wastewater discharges to the Baltic&#13;
Sea; (b) amelioration of water quality in the town of Haapsalu; (c) pollution&#13;
reduction in the Haapsalu and Matsalu Bays; and (d) protection of Matsalu State&#13;
Nature Reserve through effective environmental management. The proposed&#13;
Project has been placed in environmental screening category "B". An&#13;
environmental review consistent with the provisions of the requirements of the&#13;
Estonian "Order on Carrying Out Environmental Impact Assessment" and the&#13;
provisions of World Bank Operational Directive 4.01 "Environmental&#13;
Assessment" has been prepared for the WWIC. Supplemental environmental&#13;
reviews would be prepared as part of the detailed planning process for activities&#13;
supported under the EMC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iii -&#13;
Project Risks:       The main risks are: (a) the commitment and ability of the Haapsalu City Council&#13;
to support an independently managed water and wastewater utility which may&#13;
interfere, inter alia, with the commitment of the Haapsalu City Council to adjust&#13;
tariffs; and (b) possible resistance from local governments and private landowners&#13;
to recommended actions aimed at managing point and non-point source pollution&#13;
in the Matsalu Bay catchment. These risks would reduced by: (a) carefully&#13;
monitoring the requirements for tariff increases and providing significant&#13;
institutional development support to the utility to improve its financial&#13;
management  practices;  (b)  ensuring  appropriate  project management&#13;
arrangements are in place in a timely manner; and (c) incorporation of an active&#13;
local participation process in development and implementation of the proposed&#13;
management activities for Matsalu State Nature Reserve and the Matsalu Bay&#13;
catchment.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Country Context&#13;
1.1           Estonia is a country with a population of about 1.6 million covering 45,200 km2 on the&#13;
eastern shore of the Baltic Sea. Ethnic Estonians make up approximately 62 percent of the population,&#13;
while ethnic Russians at 30 percent of the population, constitute the country's largest minority. During&#13;
the period of Soviet rule, Estonia had a strong economy based on relatively sophisticated industries and&#13;
agriculture, and enjoyed the highest standard of living among the republics of the former Soviet Union.&#13;
Since regaining independence in 1991, Estonia has initiated major political and economic reforms which&#13;
have brought it from a centrally planned to a transitional market economy. In this process, it is&#13;
experiencing adjustment shocks common to many economies in transition, characterized by a significant&#13;
decline in economic productivity and high inflation rates, with the gross domestic product&#13;
(GDP) declining sharply as a result of the collapse of trading relations with Russia and other former&#13;
Soviet Republics.&#13;
1.2           The Government of Estonia (GOE) has been pursuing economic reform and stabilization,&#13;
including price and trade liberalization. The liberalization of prices, begun in December 1989, marked&#13;
the first step in the country's formal macroeconomic stabilization program. Since then, Estonia has been&#13;
successful in containing monetary and fiscal deficits. Initially, prices increased sharply as the distorted&#13;
relative prices inherited from the Soviet system adjusted to world levels. Tight fiscal discipline helped&#13;
assure the success of the currency board scheme under which the new currency, the kroon, was&#13;
introduced in June 1992. The kroon is fully backed by foreign exchange and has remained pegged at&#13;
EEK 8 per DM since its introduction. The net international reserves increased 20 percent from 1993 to&#13;
1994. The annual inflation rate fell from 89 percent in 1993 to 41 percent in 1994'. The estimated per&#13;
capita income level in 1993 was US $3,040. Output started to recover in the second quarter of 1993, and&#13;
the Bank has projected 5 percent annual real GDP growth through the end of the decade.&#13;
1.3           The Bank's overall strategy in Estonia is to support the country's efforts to accelerate&#13;
structural reforms leading to a full transition to a market-based economy and, at the same time, to support&#13;
efficient investments in high priority sectors to facilitate the return to economic growth. To date the Bank&#13;
has provided the GOE with a Rehabilitation Loan of US $30 million in October 1992 (Report No. 3525-&#13;
EE), US $12 million in support of a Highway Maintenance Project in May 1994 (Report No. 3731-EE),&#13;
US $38.4 million for a District Heating Rehabilitation Project in May 1994 (Report No. 3740-EE), US&#13;
$10 million for a Financial Institutions Development Project in October 1994 (Report No. 3803-EE) and&#13;
US $18 million for a Health Project in January 1995 (Report No. 3835-EE). Implementation of these&#13;
projects is proceeding satisfactorily.&#13;
1.4          Infrastructure rehabilitation and development is considered one Estonia's priorities for&#13;
support. The recently completed Public Expenditure Review, jointly prepared by the GOE and the Bank,&#13;
highlighted the need to support investments in energy, transport and environmental services, including&#13;
improved water supply and wastewater treatment. The priority given to investments for environmental&#13;
services is justified by the need to improve the quality and reliability of drinking water and to address&#13;
the water quality problems and health risks created by the discharge of partially treated and untreated&#13;
wastewater to water courses and the marine environment. The proposed Project would support the&#13;
I      The Bank projects an annual inflation of: 20% - 1995, 12% - 1996, 8% - 1997, 6% - 1998.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
improvement of water quality and wastewater services in the city of Haapsalu, and demonstrate the&#13;
application of a variety of environmental management methods to support environmenitally sound&#13;
development in the catchment area of Matsalu Bay.&#13;
B. Sectoral Context&#13;
1.5          Institutional Settings. The central environmental protection authority in Estonia is the&#13;
Ministry of Environment (MOE). It serves as the principal institution for the country's environmental&#13;
policy system, together with the Forest Board and the Fisheries Board. These three institutions form the&#13;
policy level of the system responsible for legislation, information systems, regulation, and control. The&#13;
implementation level for environmental monitoring and control work includes 19 County Environment&#13;
Departments (CEDs), the Institute of Hydrology and Meteorology, 4 regional laboratories, the Nature&#13;
Protection Inspectorate and the Sea Protection Inspectorate. The MOE is responsible for: (a) developing&#13;
environmental policy and strategy, legislation, and standards; (b) coordinating management of natural&#13;
resources and scientific research; (c) organizing environmental monitoring; and (d) carrying out&#13;
environmental impact assessments, of nationally significant projects. The Chief Inspector of the Nature&#13;
Protection Inspectorate is responsible for the enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and&#13;
standards.&#13;
1.6           The CEDs, which represent Estonia's 14 counties and five of the larger municipalities,&#13;
are relatively independent of the MOE and are considered divisions of local government. T hey issue&#13;
permits, impose and collect pollution charges from factories, administer the local environmental budgets&#13;
accumulating from their share of such charges, receive emissions reports from industries under their&#13;
jurisdiction, and generally try to oversee progress toward environmental goals. The level of expertise&#13;
varies across CEDs, with those in the larger municipalities usually having a larger and better qualified&#13;
staff.&#13;
1.7           Legislative Framework. Environmental legislation in Estonia is still under developmlelnt.&#13;
The current transitional status is characterized by a combination of the administrative procedures,&#13;
legislation, and standards used when Estonia was part of the Soviet Union and some new provisions&#13;
stipulated by the GOE. The new Constitution of the Republic of Estonia contains a paragraph which&#13;
obligates each individual "to preserve human and natural environment and to compensate for damages&#13;
caused by him or her to the environment." Estonia's Basic Law on Nature and Environment Protection&#13;
was passed in 1990 and important laws and government regulations regarding hazardous waste, solid&#13;
waste, Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), and natural resource and pollution taxes have been&#13;
passed since then. EIA in Estonia is a licensed activity; to date approximately 100 individual experts and&#13;
firms have been licensed to perform various tasks associated with EIA. The MOE is responsible for&#13;
review of EIAs when proposed projects are of national significance, while CEDs are responsible for the&#13;
EIA of projects of local significance. Due to the relative inexperience and understaffing of CEDs, local&#13;
EIA is not being performed to the standards set forth in the government regulation on EIA. The MOE,&#13;
with the cooperation of the Stockholm Environmental Institute-Tallinn, is continuing work to improve the&#13;
quality of local EIA through improved access to information regarding EIA procedures and requirements.&#13;
1.8           Most of the environmental standards in use are based on the "Maximum Permissible&#13;
Concentrations" system developed in the former Soviet Union. The main problem with this system is that&#13;
there are too many standards (1300 for water quality alone), and many are considered excessively strict&#13;
and even unattainable; effective monitoring and control of all substances is thus impossible. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
government regulation "On the System of Charges and Taxes in Nature Management" (February&#13;
1990) established charges for the use of natural resources and set forth a schedule of fines levied for&#13;
violations of environmental legislation. The revenues collected from resource charges are channelled to&#13;
state and local budgets (the ratio paid to the state budget ranges from 30-80 percent of the total charge).&#13;
Taxes paid for excess pollution remain in the local budget. Regular pollution taxes are paid to the&#13;
Estonian Environmental Fund, created in 1983. Its mandate was revised in January 1994 to reflect the&#13;
recent legislative changes relating to pollution charges as a supplement to the state budget for financing&#13;
of national, regional and local environmental programs and measures. Half of the fees paid into the Fund&#13;
are channelled for national use, while the other half is retained in the fund of the district from which the&#13;
payment originated. The 1994 draft budget projects revenues to the Fund (including carryover from the&#13;
prior year) to equal EEK 19.2 million (about US $1.51 million), and expenditures to equal EEK 19.0&#13;
million (about US $1.50 million) for a surplus of EEK 200,000 (about US $15,000).&#13;
1.9          Estonia is a party to a number of international environmental conventions and treaties.&#13;
It has signed and ratified the "Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea&#13;
Area" (Helsinki Convention), which obligates it to undertake concrete actions to reduce marine pollution&#13;
from land based sources and to implement a wide range of recommendations on various environmental&#13;
matters which are developed by the Helsinki Commission (HELCOM) through a process of active input,&#13;
review and approval by the signatory parties to the Convention. In this context, Estonia has been an&#13;
active participant in many programs of HELCOM, including the Programme Implementation Task Force&#13;
(PITF) which is responsible for coordinating implementation of the Baltic Sea Joint Comprehensive&#13;
Environmental Action Programme (JCP) adopted in 1992. In addition, Estonia has signed and/or ratified&#13;
a number of international treaties, including the Ramsar, Gdansk, Bern, Bonn and Basel Conventions.&#13;
Estonia is also active in the Environmental Action Program for Central and Eastern Europe (EAP) and&#13;
the environmental working groups of the United Nations Economic Council for Europe (UN/ECE).&#13;
1.10         Country Environment Policy and Strategy. A new national environmental action plan based&#13;
on policy reform, institutional strengthening and investment is currently being prepared within the context&#13;
of the Environmental Action Program for Central and Eastern Europe with support from EU (PHARE).&#13;
The GOE has identified the following as being some of the most important measures to be taken&#13;
regarding policy reform: (a) incorporation of environmental considerations into the development of key&#13;
sectors such as industry, agriculture, transport, etc.; (b) continued development of the environmental&#13;
taxation system and the Estonian Environmental Fund for financing environmental measures;&#13;
(c) introduction of a framework for legislative and regulatory mechanisms; (d) promotion of public&#13;
awareness and participation in the environmental decision making process; and (e) decentralization of&#13;
environmnental and resource management responsibilities to municipal and local governments. As noted&#13;
at the "Public Expenditure Conference," the GOE has emphasized the importance of institution building&#13;
and strengthening as prerequisites for policy development and implementation, especially at the municipal&#13;
level. It has also requested Bank support for preparation of a "Public Environmental Awareness and&#13;
Education Program."&#13;
1.11         Sector Priorities. Environmental issues are a central concern for the GOE which takes&#13;
its international environmental commitments seriously. The GOE is committed to improving water&#13;
resource management in the country and has stated its clear intent to develop new and more effective&#13;
mechanisms for water pollution control. As was noted at the May 1994 "Public Expenditure Conference,"&#13;
an important element of Estonia's national environmental management strategy is the decentralization of&#13;
responsibilities for environmental management, with a greater emphasis being placed on the role of&#13;
municipal and local governments in this area. The GOE intends to give investment priority to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
environmental projects aimed at improving water supply and wastewater treatment. The ability of the&#13;
GOE to embark on major public infrastructure investments in the water sector is hampered, however, by&#13;
the current overall economic situation of the country, making it unlikely that the GOE can undertake such&#13;
investments without external funding support.&#13;
1 .12         Coastal Zone and Protected Areas. Estonia has protected areas covering approximately&#13;
7 percent of the total land area. These include 6 state-level reserves, 57 reserves of national significance,&#13;
78 reserves of local importance, and 232 landscape elements. The maintenance of these protected areas&#13;
is becoming increasingly complex due to the problems associated with restoring land to pre-1940 owners,&#13;
and the government's limited financial capacity to either compensate private owners for loss of land or&#13;
manage the areas itself.&#13;
1.13          Drainage of wetlands for agriculture and exploitation of timber from wet forests is also&#13;
a cause for concern due to the potential loss of habitat. Unless adequate control measures are adopted,&#13;
it is possible that wet forests may be drained further to accommodate additional timber harvesting. In&#13;
addition, the return of land to pre-1940 owners or their heirs may create pressure from small holders for&#13;
drainage programs to improve agricultural productivity and allow for small scale timber harvesting which&#13;
would result in a reduction of wetland areas.&#13;
1.14          Water and Wastewater Services. Water supply needs of domestic and industrial consumers&#13;
are primarily met by groundwater supplies in order to avoid using surface waters polluted by dewatering&#13;
of oil-shale mines, agricultural runoff, and the direct discharge of wastewaters from Estonia's major&#13;
urban areas into the Gulf of Finland, the eastern Baltic Sea, and the Gulf of Riga. Increased levels of&#13;
nitrogen and phosphorous in the raw water supply have made the provision of clean drinking water more&#13;
difficult and costly. In 1993, approximately 13.5 percent of the available drinking water in Estonia failed&#13;
to meet health standards. The Estonian authorities have increased the use of deep groundwater to&#13;
minimize the public health risk associated with contaminated surface and shallow groundwater. High&#13;
levels of bacteriological pollution resulting from discharge of raw sewage and industrial wastewaters into&#13;
coastal areas have forced the closure of many beaches, including recreationally important beaches near&#13;
Tallinn, Haapsalu, and Parnu.&#13;
1.15          Water consumption in Estonia has been decreasing over the past four years as a result of&#13;
the accompanying overall economic restructuring process. Total water extraction in Estonia in 1993 was&#13;
2.1 billion cubic meters, of which 1.8 billion were consumed. Approximately 80 percent of Estonia's&#13;
population is connected to the water supply system.&#13;
1.16          Estonia's sewerage system covers approximately 80-85 percent of the country's inhabitants&#13;
and industrial enterprises. However, many of the treatment plants in the system are in very poor condition&#13;
and offer little or no real treatment of wastewater. Almost all of the existing treatment plants require&#13;
modernization and rehabilitation. The total amount of wastewater discharged by domestic and industrial&#13;
consumers in 1993 was estimated at 2.1 billion cubic meters. Of the 393 million cubic meters of&#13;
wastewater requiring some type of treatment, 370 million cubic meters were treated, though just over half&#13;
of that amount received only mechanical treatment. As a result, much of Estonia's wastewater is&#13;
inadequately treated and in some cases, wastewaters are discharged without treatment.&#13;
1.17          User charges for water and sewage are set by individual water and wastewater enterprises,&#13;
but must be approved by their respective city councils. Although water and sewage tariffs have generally&#13;
risen, they are still inadequate to permit proper maintenance of infrastructure or investment in new assets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
In general, most water and wastewater enterprises have been covering their operating expenses, although&#13;
non-payment of tariffs, especially by industrial users, has, and continues to be, a serious problem for&#13;
most cities. Investment costs have been financed by transfers from the state budget.&#13;
1.18          In order to implement sound management practices, tariffs would need to be increased&#13;
by the majority of the country's water and wastewater utilities and collection performance would need&#13;
to be improved to cover not only operational and maintenance costs but capital costs as well. Strategies&#13;
for financing the replacement and rehabilitation of old equipment would have to be explored, along with&#13;
strategies for leakage reduction and improved tariff collection.&#13;
1.19          Privatization/Municipalization. Privatization of state-owned property in Estonia is&#13;
proceeding well with the government moving on several different tracks, but there remain difficult issues&#13;
to address. A number of enterprises have been privatized. The government has not recommended&#13;
privatization of the country's water and wastewater enterprises. However, the national government has&#13;
transferred the plants of the national state-owned water and wastewater administration "Eesti Vesi"&#13;
(Estonian Water) to the ownership of the respective municipalities as part of the process of&#13;
decentralization, enabling the municipalities to establish independent municipally-owned companies. Under&#13;
the Law on Local Government Arrangement (1993), the cities or town councils have the authority to&#13;
establish taxes and fees (including tariffs for water and wastewater) once responsibility for the enterprise&#13;
has been transferred. As water and wastewater enterprises are transferred to municipalities, outright&#13;
privatization of the enterprises, or the establishment of joint ventures or concessional agreements with&#13;
foreign investors regarding enterprise operation, is possible if the municipality so decides.&#13;
1.20          Tourism Development. Estonia's tourism sector has strong potential to attract visitors from&#13;
abroad. The Hanseatic city of Tallinn with its "Old Town" is currently the most popular tourist attraction,&#13;
but the university town of Tartu and the coastal spa towns of Parnu and Haapsalu have a long history of&#13;
attracting foreign tourists. Potential spots for eco-tourism include the Lahemaa National Park, the Matsalu&#13;
State Nature Reserve (a Ramsar Convention site), and the Estonian Islands Biosphere Reserve. The&#13;
coastline of Estonia has numerous bays, straits, and over 1,500 islets. There are more than 1,000 inland&#13;
lakes, large areas of forests, and wild game which has already attracted a number of hunting enthusiasts&#13;
from other countries. The large Baltic islands of Hiiumaa and Saaremaa, whose populations have&#13;
preserved their vernacular architecture and cultural traditions, could serve as an additional attraction.&#13;
1.21          Statistical data show that tourism has been declining since 1989 when approximately&#13;
650,000 tourists visited Estonia. In 1993, that number had decreased to 478,000. However, the&#13;
proportion of tourists from Western Europe has increased substantially. In 1993, approximately 80&#13;
percent of all foreign tourists came from Finland, 10 percent from Sweden, and 4 percent from Germany.&#13;
Approximately 80 percent of all foreign tourists stay in Estonia for less than one day; however, growing&#13;
numbers of visitors are going beyond Tallinn and making visits of up to one .veek. In 1993, the Estonian&#13;
Tourism Board began setting up a registry of accommodation service companies. The registry currently&#13;
contains 220 different hotels, holiday homes and other similar facilities. From an economic viewpoint,&#13;
the revitalization and diversification of tourism in the region is important for creation of employment and&#13;
income generation opportunities in rural settlements which have suffered serious economic dislocations&#13;
during the restructuring process. There is currently a shortage of tourist accommodations in Tallinn while&#13;
many hotels, spas, and other facilities in rural areas have trouble attracting visitors. It should be kept in&#13;
mind, however, that the tourism potential is connected to future environmental conditions, such as the&#13;
quality of the water of the Baltic Sea and the general aesthetic conditions of the region.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

C. The Project Area&#13;
1.22          Overview. The Project area includes two scenic bays on the Baltic coast of western&#13;
Estonia: (a) Haapsalu Bay to the north which is dominated by the historic town of Haapsalu; and (b)&#13;
Matsalu Bay to the south, featuring Matsalu State Nature Reserve, a site of international significance for&#13;
migratory birds. These bays are fringed by the islands of Vormsi, Hiiumaa, and Saaremaa, which&#13;
together create a semi-enclosed area dominated by a variety of terrestrial and marine ecosystems suitable&#13;
for a range of conservation and recreational uses. In recognition of their regional importance, the JCP&#13;
identified actions to address the management of wastewater discharges from the Municipality of Haapsalu&#13;
and management of the ecologically critical Matsalu Bay among the top priority actions to be taken in&#13;
the context of the Baltic Sea Environment Program.&#13;
1.23          Haapsalu. The city of Haapsalu is located on the western coast of Estonia, lying on a long&#13;
and narrow peninsula that reaches into the sea and divides the Haapsalu Bay into the open Eeslaht and&#13;
the shallow Tagalaht. It occupies an area of approximately 11 km2 and has a population of about 14,000;&#13;
non-Estonians make up about 23 percent of the city's population. It is a scenic city dominated by a castle&#13;
and features extensive districts of historic wooden homes. The city has a major former Soviet air base,&#13;
but most of the Russian military personnel and their families have left and the air field is currently not&#13;
used. Haapsalu has no major industries, but has strong potential to reclaim and develop its historical&#13;
position as a major tourist resort, which was a summer spa of the Russian imperial family. In addition,&#13;
the marine environment of Haapsalu contains deposits of curative mud which has economic value, both&#13;
in the domestic market as well as for export. The mud is used for medical purposes in the treatment of&#13;
rheumatism and nerve diseases in arms and legs. The biologically active substances present in the mud&#13;
have also been used in veterinary medicine, cosmetics, and fertilizers. At present, mud is taken only from&#13;
one of two deposits closest to town. It is this deposit which stands to benefit most from improved&#13;
wastewater treatment. Eco-tourism could be developed in both Haapsalu Bay and the adjacent Matsalu&#13;
Bay, both of which have rich and diverse wildlife.&#13;
1.24          Haapsalu Water Works. The Haapsalu Water Works (HWW) serves about 2/3 of the&#13;
area's 14,000 residents and associated small industries. The ownership of the utility has just recently been&#13;
transferred from the national water and wastewater administration Eesti Vesi, to the Municipality of&#13;
Haapsalu (MOH). The MOH has formed HWW to a municipal enterprise in accordance with the Law&#13;
on Municipal Enterprises. The legal process was finalized February 10, 1995. HWW has characteristics&#13;
comrnon to many water and wastewater utilities in Central and Eastern Europe, including management&#13;
and administration. It has a small core staff of committed management who are seeking to change their&#13;
utility to make it function better and to gain greater access to resources for investment. The enterprise's&#13;
financial source are the tariffs collected for water and sewage services.&#13;
1.25          Water Supply and Levels of Service. Water supply services in Haapsalu are currently&#13;
acceptable both in delivery and in health standards. The reliability of the equipment in the pumping&#13;
stations, however, is questionable and the supply of spare parts erratic. It is necessary to replace almost&#13;
half the pumps each year, resulting in excessive maintenance costs. The large number of historic wooden&#13;
houses creates special water supply requirements for fire fighting services.&#13;
1.26          The water supply for Haapsalu is taken from groundwater sources via twelve wells&#13;
offering a total water supply of 9,600 m3/day. The length of Haapsalu's water network, together with that&#13;
of Uuemoisa, is 33 km. All larger buildings are connected to the network, but many private households&#13;
take water from one of the city's 52 street hydrants, or from shallow hand pump wells. Water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
consumption in Haapsalu is currently about 3,500 m3/d (1.5 million m3/yr), down from about 6,000 m3/d&#13;
(2.2 million m3/yr) in 1990. The average household water consumption is estimated at 140 liter per&#13;
capita. While current water consumption is well within the total capacity of the water supply, the capacity&#13;
of the existing water reservoirs is too small to meet the requirements on flow equalization and water&#13;
supply during emergency situations.&#13;
1.27          Sanitation Facilities and Levels of Service. The length of the sewage system in Haapsalu&#13;
is 20 km, and in the adjacent settlements of Uuemoisa and Paalepa, 6 km. There are 13 pumping stations&#13;
in Haapsalu's sewage system and a treatment plant equipped to perform mechanical treatment. In&#13;
Uuemoisa there are 4 pumping stations. The existing network does not reach all of Haapsalu's residents&#13;
and industries. There are two outlets discharging untreated sewage directly into Haapsalu Bay and then&#13;
into the Baltic Sea. Total average wastewater flow to the treatment plant (calculated from measured water&#13;
consumption) is 5550 m3/d. In rainy periods, the flow to the treatment plant can reachl000 m3/hour. The&#13;
infiltration of groundwater into the concrete, ceramic, and asbestos-cement pipelines is substantial.&#13;
1.28          The existing wastewater treatment plant is in very poor condition and is in dire need of&#13;
reconstruction and rehabilitation. Some of the existing structures could be utilized in the new treatment&#13;
plant. Analyses of treated wastewater are performed once a month in the Eesti Vesi laboratory in Tallinn,&#13;
as the local laboratory is not in operation. Microbiological loading to the receiving waters is high, and&#13;
advisory notices warning against swimming have been posted at the beaches near the town. Treatment&#13;
results from existing facilities are well below "HELCOM Recommendations" for wastewater discharges.&#13;
1.29          Major areas of concern are: (a) due to discharge of wastewater, the marine environment&#13;
in the vicinity of Haapsalu Town is heavily eutrophied and swimming is forbidden; (b) results of&#13;
wastewater treatment do not meet "HELCOM Recommendations"; (c) the treatment plant and pumping&#13;
stations are in poor condition, and (d) drainage of the sludge composting area is erratic, allowing for&#13;
water accumulation during rainy periods and creating a risk of spillage into the Baltic Sea.&#13;
1.30          Matsalu Bay. Matsalu Bay lies approximately 20 km to the south of the city of Haapsalu&#13;
and drains a catchment of some 3,200 km2 which is mostly agricultural in nature. Only the two small&#13;
towns of Rapla and Lihula lie in the catchment, along with approximately 10 smaller settlements and&#13;
former state farms. However, due to the extensive area of the drainage basin, the total population&#13;
isaround 40,000. Matsalu Bay is included in the HELCOM list of "priority hot-spots" for Estonia,&#13;
because of its international and regional importance as a wetland and nature reserve.&#13;
1.31          The shoreline of Matsalu Bay is extremely intricate and there are over ten islets in the&#13;
bay itself. The diverse nature of the flora has resulted in the development of a unique variety of habitats,&#13;
especially for migrating and breeding birds. The area is important for international scientific research,&#13;
and is the center for the Estonian bird ringing program. The bay is one of the stopping areas on the Baltic&#13;
portion of the East African-European-Arctic flyway for migratory birds and is a critical part of a complex&#13;
system of coastal wildlife habitats which includes Lake Pape in Latvia and the Nemunas Delta in&#13;
Lithuania.&#13;
1.32          The Matsalu wetland is being negatively affected by drainage from the wet meadows of&#13;
the Kasari River, pollution from surrounding cattle farms, accelerating eutrophication from catchment&#13;
run-off, and by inadequately controlled sport fishing from motor boats. The main problem is organic&#13;
enrichment and eutrophication which results in the expansion of the area of reed beds in the bay&#13;
(approximately 60 hectares annually). This alters sedimentation and habitat distribution, thereby affecting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
the use of the area by migrating birds and other species. The nutrient enrichment trend has abated&#13;
somewhat in recent years, as the rising costs of fertilizers has led to a decrease in their use. However,&#13;
the communal and agro-industrial point-source pollution from nearby Lihula and other area communities&#13;
continues to be a significant contributor to the nutrient load in the bay.&#13;
1.33          Protected Areas. The Matsalu State Nature Reserve was created in 1957 and covers an&#13;
area of approximately 48,000 hectares including part of Matsalu Bay and the Kasari River delta. The&#13;
nearest town, Lihula (population 1,900), is located three kilometers to the south. Due to its strategic&#13;
location along the East African-European-Arctic flyway, the Reserve was designated as a site of&#13;
international significance to migratory birds under the Ramsar Convention in 1976. Bird life, semi-natural&#13;
plant communities, flood plains, reed beds, coastal and wooded meadows are considered the Reserve's&#13;
chief environmental assets. Birds depend on both the vegetation and the waters for nesting, feeding,&#13;
resting and molting. Some 259 species of birds have been recorded at the Reserve, and millions of birds&#13;
are believed to migrate through the Reserve annually. In addition, 48 mammal species and 40 fish species&#13;
have been recorded in the Reserve. The wetland also has the potential to be a locally important economic&#13;
resource, as the reeds can be sold domestically for thatching or to the Nordic countries and Germany for&#13;
use as traditional roofing material. The present annual harvest is worth approximately EEK 500,000&#13;
(US$40,000 equivalent) and provides off-season employment to local farmers.&#13;
1.34          Effective management of the Matsalu Reserve faces several challenges. Maintenance of&#13;
the coastal meadows requires constant human intervention to prevent junipers and other opportunistic&#13;
species from invading and making the meadows less attractive to migrating birds. Pollution of the Kasari&#13;
River from agricultural runoff and insufficiently treated wastewaters degrades the quality of the bay's&#13;
waters and alters the natural habitats for a number of species. The resources available to the GOE for&#13;
maintenance of this important wetland, however, are limited. The Matsalu Nature Reserve Administration&#13;
is a state institution directly subordinate to the Ministry of Environment. In past years it employed up to&#13;
70 people, but budget cuts in the past few years have reduced the staff to 30 employees, including four&#13;
researchers and five rangers. The Administration's budget for 1994 is EEK 777,000 (about&#13;
US $61,000) including salaries, benefits, and capital investments.&#13;
1.35          A Management Plan for the Matsalu State Nature Reserve was completed in early 1994&#13;
by the staff of the Matsalu Reserve with support from the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). It was&#13;
subsequently reviewed and adopted by the MOE which administers the Reserve. The Plan presents an&#13;
initial Three Year Action Plan as part of a long term strategy for the conservation and management of&#13;
the area. It includes a description of the wetlands, their features and the threats posed to the Reserve.&#13;
Zones are defined for various management purposes, with related actions presented, prioritized, and&#13;
priced for the short- and long-term management of the area. The Plan notes the critical need to restore&#13;
and maintain traditional agricultural systems, which play an important role in habitat creation and&#13;
maintenance.&#13;
1.36          Tourism and the Demand for Tourism Facilities in the Project Area. The GOE in 1992&#13;
identified tourism as a priority branch of the nation's economy. An integral part of that strategy is the&#13;
development of tourism in the areas surrounding Haapsalu and Matsalu Bays. Haapsalu, with its unique&#13;
curative mud spas, has been an established health resort town since the early 19th century. Currently a&#13;
major part of the tourism can be attributed to the mud spas. The old part of Haapsalu is preserved as a&#13;
monument of historical urban architecture and is dominated by the grounds of a partly restored 13th&#13;
century castle. Over thirty local businesses have united in a new organization called "Haapsalu Tourism"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
to facilitate the development of tourism, business and industry in Haapsalu town and Laane County. In&#13;
1994, an estimated 20,000 tourists visited Haapsalu.&#13;
1.37          Matsalu's international importance as a stopping point for migratory birds makes it an&#13;
attractive location for nature-related tourism. The Matsalu State Nature Reserve, with proper investments&#13;
and management, could become a major tourist attraction as well as an important source of revenue for&#13;
the GOE. Estimates for the annual number of visitors to the Reserve range from 1,000 to 5,000. While&#13;
the number of tourists from Estonia and other FSU countries has declined in recent years, the number&#13;
of Finnish and Swedish tourists has increased significantly and is expected to continue expanding&#13;
substantially in the future. The Reserve has the potential to attract bird watchers as well as sport&#13;
fishermen but its current infrastructure is insufficient to support a significant increase in visitors. Priority&#13;
actions to upgrade the accessibility and attractiveness of the Reserve include renovation of access roads,&#13;
upgrading of overnight accommodations, construction of bird-watching towers, installation of multi-&#13;
lingual informational signs, and improvement of information about the Reserve.&#13;
D. Bank Environment Strategy in Estonia, Past Experience and Rationale&#13;
1.38          Environment is one of the focal areas of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)&#13;
for Estonia; hence, priority investments in the sector together with the project's intended support to the&#13;
decentralization process in the country makes it rank highly in the Bank's program in Estonia. These&#13;
activities should be consistent with the objectives and recommendations of the Environmental Action Plan&#13;
for Central and Eastern Europe, the JCP and national priorities as established by MOE in the "Public&#13;
Expenditure Review". The Bank strategy recognizes the need to support: (a) preventive measures to avoid&#13;
adverse environmental impacts, through the use of policy and regulatory measures, environmental&#13;
assessments, environmental planning methods and economic instruments; and (b) curative measures to&#13;
address existing problems of air, water and soil pollution in a cost effective manner. At the operational&#13;
level, the strategy is to support projects that have a high demonstration and replication value at the&#13;
national and regional level. The investment components should focus on the rehabilitation of critical&#13;
infrastructure and/or support well justified and phased expansion of facilities at priority locations,&#13;
complemented by support for institutional strengthening activities. The Bank also seeks to develop&#13;
projects which can provide the basis for the effective mobilization of resources from other international&#13;
financial institutions, bilateral donors and non-governmental sources and to build local institutional&#13;
capacity in promoting self-sufficiency in the future.&#13;
1.39          The support of the Bank for the proposed Project would provide an opportunity to assist&#13;
the Estonian Government in its efforts to improve the governments capacity to coordinate and manage&#13;
environmental projects, to improve national environmental quality, protect the Baltic Sea and demonstrate&#13;
environmental management techniques. In the absence of Bank involvement, it is unlikely that the country&#13;
would be able to mobilize the technical assistance and financial resources required to implement an&#13;
environmental project for this environmentally and economically important area of the country. The&#13;
Project would provide a mechanism for the Bank to test the feasibility of rapid preparation and&#13;
implementation of small projects for priority environmental investment activities in the FSU and Baltic&#13;
countries. It would also expand the range of Bank experience in supporting the planning and&#13;
implementation of eco-tourism related management activities and investments in protected areas, which&#13;
is a rapidly growing type of activity, given the increased emphasis on "environmentally sustainable&#13;
development. "&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
1.40          In the water and wastewater area the strategy for Central and Eastern Europe has been&#13;
integrated into the Bank's environmental program and presented by the Bank in a number of forums,&#13;
including the Workshop on Water and Wastewater Utilities held in Riga (1993) and the Resource&#13;
Mobilization Conference for the Baltic Sea Environment Program held in Gdansk (1993). The key&#13;
elements of the strategy are:&#13;
(a)    establishing strong water supply and wastewater utilities to support sustainable&#13;
investments in municipal water and wastewater treatment through the development of&#13;
autonomous self-financing municipal/regional public or private water and wastewater&#13;
utilities;&#13;
(b)    supporting least cost planning and investment selections for municipal/industrial water&#13;
supply and wastewater systems, which are properly sized and designed;&#13;
(c)    promoting water demand management to maximize investment resources and reduce&#13;
operating costs;&#13;
(d)    supporting actions for rehabilitation of existing systems, improvements in operational&#13;
efficiency, phasing and utilization of cost-effective technologies to reduce investment and&#13;
operating costs significantly; and&#13;
(e)    promoting the careful analysis of the impact of industries and taking into consideration&#13;
actions to reduce industrial water consumption and wastewater discharges.&#13;
1.41          Bank experience in the implementation of environmental management projects in Central&#13;
and Eastern Europe to date centers on the lessons learned from the US $27.3 million Environment&#13;
Management Project in Poland which is in its final year. This Project demonstrated the importance of:&#13;
(a)    establishing locally staffed project implementation units which have personnel well trained&#13;
in project supervision, financial management and competitive procurement procedures,&#13;
further supported with proper independent auditing; and&#13;
(b)    careful monitoring of the availability of local counterpart funds.&#13;
It also demonstrated the high potential of a well designed and managed project to attract donor support&#13;
for priority activities. These lessons have been considered in the design of the proposed Project.&#13;
1.42          Previous regional experience in environment projects is limited but accumulating. The&#13;
Liepaja Environment Project in Latvia and Klaipeda Environment Project in Lithuania were approved by&#13;
the Board in December 1994 and are now under implementation. Bank experience worldwide in the water&#13;
and wastewater sector is extensive, however. Important lessons learned include:&#13;
(a)   justifying investments in municipal wastewater treatment plants within the context of a&#13;
basin-wide, least-cost strategy for improving ambient water quality, in accordance with&#13;
a phased plan for water quality improvements;&#13;
(b)    making investment decisions that are guided by a medium-term, prioritized least-cost&#13;
investment plan covering all of a utility's needs. The definition of this investment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
program requires the preparation of comprehensive master plans and feasibility studies;&#13;
and&#13;
(c)    validating investment decisions by careful financial plans (including financial projections),&#13;
complemented by institutional strengthening action plans, to ensure that the proposed&#13;
investment program is financially viable and that the utility is prepared to assume the&#13;
responsibility for effective management of systems and facilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Origin and Fornulation&#13;
2.1           In 1974, the countries of the Baltic Sea region signed the "Convention on the Protection&#13;
of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area" in Helsinki. This convention, commonly referred to&#13;
as the Helsinki Convention, was the first international regional seas agreement and created a framework&#13;
for regional environmental cooperation. To accelerate the rate of progress in improving national and&#13;
regional environmental conditions, the Prime Ministers of Sweden and Poland jointly hosted the "Baltic&#13;
Sea Environment Conference" held in September 1990, in Ronneby, Sweden with participation at the&#13;
Prime Ministerial level. The conference included senior level participation by the Bank and resulted in&#13;
the establishment of the Baltic Sea Environment Task Force, comprised of representatives of the riparian&#13;
states of the Baltic Sea drainage basin, European Commission and international financial institutions, with&#13;
selected technical organizations and nongovernmental organizations participating as observers. The Task&#13;
Force, working under HELCOM, based in Helsinki, and with significant participation from the Bank,&#13;
prepared the JCP. This program, which was adopted by the Ministers of Environment of the Baltic Sea&#13;
region in April 1992, identified a series of priority actions concerning policies and legislation, actions&#13;
for the control of point and non-point source pollution, measures for the management of coastal lagoons&#13;
and wetlands as well as institutional strengthening and human resources development to be undertaken&#13;
as elements of a long-term regional environmental program.&#13;
2.2           Haapsalu and Matsalu State Nature Reserve were ranked by the Task Force as a priority&#13;
"hot spot" and subsequently by Estonian authorities as a high priority for national and foreign investment&#13;
in environmental protection. This position has been taken repeatedly by the GOE in a variety of&#13;
international fora, most recently by the MOE at the May 1994 Bank-sponsored "Public Investment&#13;
Conference" held in Paris. The Task Force also identified the need to undertake actions for coastal zone&#13;
management and the conservation of coastal lagoons and wetlands as key elements of the long-term&#13;
program which provides for a synergetic impact to investments in wastewater management. Conducting&#13;
such activities in the Haapsalu and Matsalu regions has been strongly supported by the MOE, given its&#13;
interest in promoting the high ecological, tourism, and recreational values of the areas.&#13;
2.3           The proposed Project is intended by the MOE to serve as a "model project" to&#13;
demonstrate complementary actions for management of point source pollution from secondary cities, small&#13;
settlements and small enterprises, and non-point source pollution from agriculture and rural areas. A&#13;
principal reason for the selection of the immediately adjacent Haapsalu and Matsalu Bays as a project area&#13;
was to have a range of interventions concentrated in a small geographic region which would also have&#13;
significant short-term impact on areas of high ecological and touristic value. The strategy of the MOE&#13;
is to have the proposed Project provide a technical and management framework for an effective&#13;
application of funds from diverse sources to maximize environmental benefits. These benefits would be&#13;
reduced if funds were used at a variety of separate locations.&#13;
2.4           The proposed Project would be the first Bank-supported investment project for&#13;
improvement of environmental quality undertaken by the GOE. It was developed by the MOE with the&#13;
assistance of the Bank as a fully integrated regional environmental project for the most ecologically&#13;
sensitive area of western Estonia. This Project is considered a high priority in terms of domestic&#13;
environmental investments actions by the GOE and in the context of Estonian legal obligations to protect&#13;
the Baltic Sea. It supports the GOE's objectives to: promote the decentralization of responsibility for&#13;
environmental services to municipal governments; reduce the State's role in the economy by strengthening&#13;
local authorities; and to restructure and modernize the water and wastewater sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
2.5          On the basis of a scries of visits made to various priority sites in Estonia by Bank staff&#13;
during preparation of the JCP and Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), the environmental&#13;
significance of the Haapsalu and Matsalu regions in a national and regional context was confirmed, the&#13;
general project feasibility reviewed and the commitment of the national and local governments to&#13;
undertake the proposed Project assessed. In the context of GOE and Bank discussions concerning follow-&#13;
up to the CEM and later to the CAS, the GOE assigned the MOE to serve as the lead agency for&#13;
coordination of the proposed Project. With Bank support, terms of reference for the required feasibility,&#13;
engineering, and environmental studies were prepared. The GOE subsequently obtained funding for&#13;
preparation of the feasibility study for water and wastewater improvements in Haapsalu from the&#13;
Government of Sweden. Following a competitive procurement process, the firms of SWECO (Sweden),&#13;
Bohlin &amp; Stromberg AB (Sweden), and Eesti Projekt (Estonia) were retained to conduct the study.&#13;
Concurrently, personnel from MOE, local governments, Tallinn Technical University, the Swedish&#13;
Environmental Protection Agency, and the WWF, with support of Bank environment staff, reviewed&#13;
potential environmental management activities for the Matsalu Bay catchmnent and Matsalu State Nature&#13;
Reserve.&#13;
2.6          Preparation of the proposed Project included an identification mission in June 1994, a pre-&#13;
appraisal mission in September-October 1994, and an appraisal mission in January 1995. In addition a&#13;
number of field visits were made by Bank staff to review specific issues and to participate in the steering&#13;
committee meetings for oversight of the feasibility study. These visits have also included the participation&#13;
of representatives of the Swedish Ministry of Environment and BITS, the Finnish Ministry of&#13;
Environment, HELCOM and the WWF. Preparation of technical specification and draft bidding&#13;
documents for goods and works contracts was initiated after negotiations, so that bidding would be able&#13;
to commence on a timely basis. It is anticipated that some contracts would be ready for award by the time&#13;
of Loan Effectiveness.&#13;
B. Project Objectives&#13;
2.7          Project Objectives. The Project objectives would be monitored according to the project&#13;
monitoring indicators listed in the PIP. The Project would have the following main objectives:&#13;
*     strengthen the MOE's capacity to coordinate and implement environmental projects;&#13;
*     reduce discharge of partially treated and untreated wastewater into the Baltic Sea;&#13;
*     restore and enhance the surface and groundwater quality in Haapsalu;&#13;
*     improve quality, reliability and cost efficiency of water supply and sanitation services in&#13;
Haapsalu;&#13;
*     improve the operational efficiency and management system in the HWW;&#13;
*     promote management of point and non-point source pollution from the catchment area of&#13;
Matsalu Bay; and&#13;
*     promote environmentally sustainable management and development of ecologically unique&#13;
and sensitive areas around Matsalu Bay and adjacent coastal areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
C. Participation by Other Organizations in Project Activities&#13;
2.8          The GOE would provide US $2.26 million equivalent and the MOH would provide&#13;
US $0.26 million equivalent for the financing of Project activities. The grant funds provided by donors&#13;
for both components are being made available to the MOE specifically to support a regional&#13;
environmental project which has been designed and would be supervised with the active support of the&#13;
Bank. It should be noted that Project preparation was coordinated by the MOE, with the support of the&#13;
Bank, with the direct participation of representatives of EU (PHARE), Finland, Sweden and WWF. The&#13;
Bank has actively supported the preparation of terms of reference which have been used by EU (PHARE)&#13;
and would be used by Denmark, Finland and Sweden. The following organizations are supporting the&#13;
implementation of the proposed Project:&#13;
(a)    The Swedish Board for Investment and Technical Support (BITS). The Government of&#13;
Sweden, through BITS has confirmed that it would provide a grant of SEK 12 million&#13;
(about US $1.6 million equivalent) to support investments for wastewater collection&#13;
improvements in Haapsalu. This funding is being provided in the context of Swedish&#13;
support for the Baltic Sea Environment Program;&#13;
(b)    Ministry of Environment of Finland. The Government of Finland, through its Ministry&#13;
of Environment, has confirmed that it would provide a grant of FIM 3.8 million (about&#13;
US $800,000 equivalent) to support improvements wastewater collection and treatment&#13;
in Haapsalu under the Water and Wastewater Improvement Component (WWIC).&#13;
Additional funding of US $220,000 equivalent would be provided to support investments&#13;
under the Environmental Management Component (EMC) in the rehabilitation and&#13;
upgrading of the wastewater treatment facilities at the small town of Lihula located&#13;
adjacent to Matsalu Bay. The funding for these activities is being provided in the context&#13;
of Finnish support for the Baltic Sea Environment Program;&#13;
(c)    Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. The Government of Sweden, through the&#13;
Environmental Protection Agency, has indicated that it would provide a grant for&#13;
supporting implementation of the proposed Project through continued support for the joint&#13;
Estonian-Swedish Study of the Matsalu Catchment Area and for demonstration activities&#13;
for agricultural run-off management on the Matsalu catchment area. The estimated cost&#13;
of these activities is SEK 2.4 million (about US $330,000). This funding would be&#13;
provided in the context of Swedish support for the Baltic Sea Environment Program;&#13;
(d)    Ministry of Environment of Denmark. The Government of Denmark, through the Danish&#13;
Environmental Protection Agency, has indicated that it anticipates providing a grant of&#13;
up to DKK 3.6 million (about US $600,000 equivalent) to support demonstration of&#13;
ecological engineering techniques for the reduction of pollution from small settlements&#13;
and agro-industries and for implementation of selected management activities in the&#13;
Matsalu State Nature Reserve. This funding would be provided in the context of Danish&#13;
support for the Baltic Sea Environment Program;&#13;
(e)    European Union (EU PHARE) Baltic Sea Regional Program. The EU (PHARE) Program&#13;
has allocated ECU 250,000 (about US $300,000) to support implementation of the&#13;
approved management plan for the Matsalu State Nature Reserve. These funds are being&#13;
provided through a contract with WWF-Denmark; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
(f)    World Wide Fundfor Nature (WWF). The WWF has prepared, with support from Sweden&#13;
and its own resources, the management plan for the Matsalu State Nature Reserve in&#13;
cooperation with the MOE and staff of the reserve. The WWF would be responsible for&#13;
implementation of selected actions funded by the EU (LIFE), in cooperation with local&#13;
counterparts.&#13;
2.9          The EMC of the proposed Project would be implemented in coordination with the&#13;
implementation of the Rapla Element of the planned Small and Medium Municipalities Water and&#13;
Wastewater Project of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). Rapla is the&#13;
major point source of pollution on the upper Matsalu Bay catchment and wastewater treatment&#13;
improvements would be supported under the EBRD project. Coordination of the various donor activities&#13;
are outlined in Sections III and IV of the PIP.&#13;
D. Project Components and Description&#13;
2.10         Project Description. A Project Implementation Plan (PIP), providing details of the&#13;
proposed Project has been prepared (Annex 1). This section, therefore, provides only a summary&#13;
description of the Project objectives, components, costs, financing, implementation arrangements,&#13;
procurement, disbursement, environmental aspects and supervision. The proposed Project would be&#13;
implemented over four years as an environmental management project. The Project has two&#13;
complementary components:&#13;
(a)    Water and Wastewater Improvement Component (WWIC - US $6.25 million). This would&#13;
include:&#13;
*     rehabilitation and expansion of the Haapsalu water and wastewater system,&#13;
including equipment and works, engineering services, and measures to control&#13;
industrial discharges; and&#13;
a     training to support institutional strengthening to assist in establishing an&#13;
autonomous and financially independent water and wastewater utility in Haapsalu.&#13;
This would include a twinning arrangement that incorporates consultancy and&#13;
advisory services, training, equipment and software. During negotiations, it was&#13;
agreed that the twinning arrangement would be carried out with a reputable&#13;
foreign water supply and sewerage utility in accordance with terms of reference&#13;
acceptable to the Bank and agreed during negotiations. The twinning contract&#13;
should be effective by October 31, 1995 (para 6.3 (a)). Annex 3A presents the&#13;
draft terms of reference for the twinning arrangement.&#13;
(b)    Environmental Management Component (EMC - US $2.12 million). This would include:&#13;
*     support for the development, implementation, and monitoring of a series of&#13;
actions to reduce point and non-point sources of discharge to the Matsalu Bay&#13;
catchment area. This would include parallel measures to upgrade the wastewater&#13;
services at Lihula and other small settlements, and measures to reduce surface&#13;
and groundwater pollution from agricultural run-off;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
*      technical and financial support for the implementation of a management plan for&#13;
the Matsalu State Nature Reserve prepared by a joint Estonian-WWF team,&#13;
focussing on improvements to make selected sites more readily accessible for&#13;
domestic and foreign visitors; and&#13;
*      support for planning and management of eco-tourism.&#13;
2.11            An Action Plan for the WWIC (Annex 2) prepared by the HWW  was discussed during&#13;
negotiations. The Action Plan states the HWW's operational, organizational, and financial goals in the&#13;
short- and medium-term and includes proposed additional steps for achieving Project objectives and&#13;
enabling efficient implementation of the WWIC. During negotiations, agreement was reached that the&#13;
Project would be carried out in accordance with the PIP and the Action Plan, with terms of reference&#13;
acceptable to the Bank for each subcomponent (para 6.2 (a)).&#13;
E. Cost Estimates&#13;
2.12            The total cost of the Project is estimated to be US $8.37 million or EEK  106 million&#13;
equivalent, including contingencies and value added tax on the local expenses. The estimated cost&#13;
distributed among Project components is shown in Table 2.1 and in greater detail in Annex 1, Tables la&#13;
and lb.&#13;

2.13         The WWIC cost is estimated at about US $6.25 million or EEK 79 million equivalent,&#13;
including contingencies and local taxes. The total base cost is estimated at US $4.60 million. Physical&#13;
contingencies are estimated at US $0.4 million. Price contingencies2 would amount to approximately&#13;
US $0.9 million or 18 percent of base cost, plus physical contingencies. Total contingencies represent&#13;
28 percent of the base cost. Conservative contingency factors have been used given the limited experience&#13;
with construction cost estimates and prices in Estonia. The foreign exchange component is estimated at&#13;
about US $3.6 million including contingencies, or about 58 percent of the total cost of the WWIC. A&#13;
value added tax of 18 percent is applied to local costs.&#13;
2.14         The EMC cost is estimated at about US $2.1 million or EEK 27 million equivalent,&#13;
including contingencies. The total base cost is estimated at US $1.60 million. Physical contingencies are&#13;
estimated at US $0.16 million. Price contingencies would amount to approximately US $0.42 million or&#13;
24 percent of base cost plus physical contingencies.&#13;
F. Project Financing Arrangements&#13;
2.15         The proposed Bank Loan of US $2.0 million would finance about 24 percent of total&#13;
Project costs including contingencies. The Bank Loan would be repaid by the GOE over 15 years&#13;
including 5 years grace at the Bank's standard variable rate of interest. As it is desireable that the PIU&#13;
for the WWIC becomes operational as soon as possible, up to US $100,000 (or 5 percent) of elibible&#13;
expenses incurred for PIU activities starting from March 1, 1995 could be submitted for retroactive&#13;
financing.&#13;
2.16         WWIC. The proposed Bank Loan would finance about 32 percent of the WWIC including&#13;
contingencies.  Parallel grant cofinancing by the Governments of Sweden (US $1.60 million&#13;
equivalent) and Finland (US $0.80 equivalent) comprises about 38 percent of total component costs. Local&#13;
counterpart contribution of EEK 20 million or US $1.6 million equivalent would be provided by the GOE&#13;
and EEK 3.3 million or US $0.26 million equivalent would be provided by the MOH.&#13;
2.17         EMC. During project preparation it was anticipated that the GOE would seek funding&#13;
from the Bank for this component; however, financing has been obtained through grants from donor&#13;
organizations. Parallel grant cofinancing by the Government of Denmark (about US $600,000 equivalent);&#13;
the Government of Sweden, through the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (US $330,000); the&#13;
Government of Finland, through the Ministry of Environment (US $220,000); and EU (PHARE)&#13;
(US $300,000) would be provided. This would be complemented by GOE contributions of US $670,000.&#13;
Although the EMC will not be funded by the Bank's loan, this subcomponent remains an integral part&#13;
of the project because it builds up the capacity of the MOE to design and implement such project in the&#13;
future and cause it complements the WWIC by addressing other important point and non-point source&#13;
pollution in the catchment area. The GOE, cooperating donors and the Bank have agreed on the&#13;
desirability of viewing these two major subcomponents as a single package, and to manage and supervise&#13;
them accordingly.&#13;
2.18         The Project has been collaboratively designed with the direct participation of&#13;
representatives of the Governments of Finland and Sweden. Extensive discussions have been held&#13;
2     The Bank projects an annual inflation of: 20% - 1995, 12% - 1996, 8% - 1997, 6% - 1998.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
concerning the respective responsibilities of the cofinancers in implementation of the Project. During&#13;
negotiations, the Borrower advised that the grants from the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency,&#13;
the Ministries of Environment of Denmark and Finland, and the and EU (PHARE) would have become&#13;
effective by December 31, 1995, or that other adequate fuinds would be available from other sources.&#13;
(para 6.1 (a)). It also was agreed that a condition for Loan effectiveness would be that all conditions&#13;
precedent to the effectiveness of the BITS and Government of Finland would have been fulfilled (para 6.5&#13;

2.19          The summarized financing plan presented in Table 2.2 includes the proceeds of the Bank&#13;
Loan, local contribution and cofinancing. More detailed financing plans can be found in Tables 2 and 3&#13;

2.20          Onlending Arrangements. The GOE's MOF would provide the funds directly to HWW.&#13;
The Borrower advised the Bank that the subsidiary agreement would be established jointly with HWW&#13;
and MOH, as the MOH approves any tariff adjustments recommended by HWW. The funds would be&#13;
passed on with a management fee of 1 percent to be retained by the MOF. The onlending would be&#13;
denominated in a foreign currency, thus HWW would bear the foreign exchange risk.3&#13;
2.21         The GOE views this proposed Project as a priority environmental investment, therefore&#13;
it is willing to guarantee the Bank Loan and providing direct assistance to the municipal government for&#13;
implementation of the Project. It is anticipated that in the longer term, once the utility becomes fully&#13;
operational and financially autonomous, it would be able to raise its own funds for additional system&#13;
expansions and treatment plan upgrades. Current commercial market rates for long term lending are&#13;
greatly distorted in Estonia. HWW would, as a new entity, which is not fully autonomous in tariff setting,&#13;
need more time to become fully independent in order to be able to raise money for its investments on the&#13;
commercial market. Thus no displacement of market borrowing is occurring.&#13;
3     GOE would however bear the residual cross currency foreign exchange risk because of the multi-currency basket of&#13;
the Bank's loan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
2.22         The favorable onlending rate should be viewed as a means of supporting major deferred&#13;
investments in rehabilitation of deteriorated infrastructure and critical major capital investments in modem&#13;
wastewater treatment facilities which would allow these companies to become capable of developing into&#13;
effective self-financing organizations. As a condition of effectiveness of the Bank Loan, a subsidiary loan&#13;
agreement would be executed between the GOE and HWW (para 6.5 (b)).&#13;
G. Procurement&#13;
2.23         During negotiations it was agreed that procurement wouldfollow the Bank's "Guidelines&#13;
for Procurement under IBRD and IDA Credits" (1992)4 and "Use of Consultants by World Bank&#13;
Borrowers and by the World Bank as an Executing Agency" (August 1981) (para 6.4 (a)). Procurement&#13;
for WWIC under parallel cofinancing arrangements (approximately US $2.40 million) would be carried&#13;
out through tied procurement in accordance with procurement regulations of the Governments of Finland&#13;
and Sweden. Procurement for the non-Bank financed components would be carried out in accordance with&#13;
procurement regulations of respective donors. Procurement for Bank financed activities would be&#13;
undertaken in the following manner:&#13;
(a)    All Bank-funded contracts which are estimated to cost more than US $200,000 equivalent&#13;
per contract would be procured following International Competitive Bidding (ICB). The&#13;
Borrower would use the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for Supply and Erect&#13;
Contracts. Five contracts totalling approximately US $1.61 million for civil works and&#13;
larger equipment for water supply and waste water systems would be awarded under ICB;&#13;
(b)    Procedures for International Shopping (IS) and Local Shopping (LS) would be used for&#13;
procurement of smaller contracts up to US $200,000 and US $50,000 respectively&#13;
because the cost of ICB would clearly outweigh possible price advantages. It is expected&#13;
that some small components such as sewerage system reconstruction and laboratory&#13;
equipment would be procured through IS. LS procedures would be used for procurement&#13;
of office equipment. Contracts awarded under IS procedures (totalling approximately US&#13;
$200,000) would be based on comparing price quotations obtained from at least three&#13;
suppliers from three eligible countries in accordance with Bank guidelines. Contracts&#13;
awarded under LS procedures (totalling approximately US $30,000) would be based on&#13;
comparing price quotations from at least three local suppliers; and&#13;
(c)    Consultant Services would be requested for consultant support for the PIU (US $0.44&#13;
million). Potential candidates would be short listed and selected on a competitive basis&#13;
according to Bank Guidelines, and hiring would be on terms and conditions acceptable&#13;
to the Bank.&#13;
4     New guidelines of January, 1995 are effective for loans for which Invitations to Negotiate have been signed after&#13;
March, 1995.&#13;

2.24         Relevant personnel from the MOE and the PIU would participate in procurement training&#13;
courses organized by the Bank. A regional procurement training course, provided by the Regional&#13;
Procurement Advisor has been tentatively scheduled for May 1995 in Lithuania in which it is anticipated&#13;
Estonian personnel would participate. The efficiency and capability of the Borrower to carry out the&#13;
Bank's procurement procedures would be strengthened through ongoing training, the use of Standard&#13;
Bidding Documents, and provision of international procurement exptertise for the PIU, financed under&#13;
the proposed Loan.&#13;
2.25         Procurement Review. All ICB procurement packages would be subject to the Bank's prior&#13;
review and approval, in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 4 of Appendix 1 of the Bank's Procurement&#13;
Guidelines. All prior review items would cover 80 percent of the total amount of the Loan. Other loan-&#13;
funded activities would be subject to the Bank's post review during the supervision of the Project, in&#13;
accordance with paragraphs 3 and 4 of Appendix 1 of the Guidelines.&#13;
2.26         Procurement Monitoring. Procurement data would be collected and recorded by the PIU&#13;
for: (a) prompt reporting of contract award information by the Borrower; (b) comprehensive quarterly&#13;
reports to the Bank by the Borrower; and (c) revised timing of procurement actions, including&#13;
advertising, bidding, contract award, and completion time for individual contracts.&#13;
H. Disbursements&#13;
2.27          Training in disbursement was provided in Riga, Latvia, by the Bank's disbursement&#13;
officer in January 1995. Disbursement advice is also available as needed from the Bank's Regional&#13;
Office in Riga.&#13;
2.28         The proposed Loan is expected to be disbursed over a period of four fiscal years (1996-&#13;
1999) with an estimated closing date in June 1999. Annual estimated disbursements are shown in Table&#13;
2.4. Descriptions of the Bank Loan proceeds and forecasts of expenditure and disbursements for the&#13;
proposed Project are shown in Annex 1, Table 6. The disbursement schedule is shown in Annex 1,&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
2.29         The proceeds of the Bank Loan would be disbursed as follows:&#13;
(a)    For goods: 100 percent of foreign expenditures, 100 percent of local ex-factory&#13;
expenditures and 80 percent of local expenditures for other items procured locally;&#13;
(b)    For works: 100 percent of foreign expenditures and 80 percent of local expenditures; and&#13;
(c)    For consultancy services and training: 100 percent of expenditures&#13;
All cofinancers would manage their own disbursements.&#13;
2.30         Disbursement requests would be prepared and submitted to the Bank by the PIU.&#13;
2.31         Disbursement would be made against standard Bank documentation. The documentation&#13;
to support these expenditures would be retained by the PIU for review by Bank supervision missions and&#13;
verification by external audits. Disbursement requests would be fully documented except for expenditures&#13;
under contracts for goods and equipment valued at less than US $200,000 equivalent and contracts for&#13;
services valued at less than US $50,000 equivalent, where statements of expenditure (SOEs) would be&#13;
used. Applications for direct payment and special commitment may be submitted provided they are for&#13;
amounts equivalent to at least US $50,000. The Bank would not honor direct payment requests below&#13;
US $50,000.&#13;
2.32         To facilitate Project implementation, the Borrower would establish a Special Account in&#13;
a major commercial bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank to cover the Bank's share of&#13;
eligible expenditures. The authorized allocation would be US $200,000 representing about four months&#13;
of average expenditures. At the request of the Borrower, and based on Project needs, the Bank would&#13;
make an initial deposit or deposits into the special account up to the amount of the authorized allocation.&#13;
Applications for replenishment of the special account would be submitted monthly or when one-third of&#13;
.he amount has been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier. Documentation requirements for replenishment&#13;
would follow the standard Bank procedure. In addition, monthly bank statements of the special account&#13;
which have been reconciled by the Borrower would accompany all replenishment requests. The terms and&#13;
conditions of the establishment and operation of the Special Account were agreed during negotiations&#13;
(para 6.1 (b)).&#13;
I. Environmental Aspects&#13;
2.33         Preparation of the proposed Project has included environrmental studies consistent with&#13;
the requirements of the Estonian "Order on Carrying Out Environmental Impact Assessment (Governrment&#13;
Regulation 13.11.92)" and the provisions of World Bank Operational Directive 4.01, "Environmental&#13;
Assessment." In accordance with these procedures, an environmental review has been prepared,&#13;
complying with the requirements for a category "B" project, for the WWIC. Implementation of the&#13;
WWIC would result in improvements in the water quality and ecological conditions in Haapsalu and&#13;
Matsalu Bays and the adjoining area of the Baltic Sea. The condition of the curative muds, which are&#13;
important to Haapsalu in terms of attracting visitors, would also be improved by the reduction in&#13;
pollution. The findings of the review, which have been used to support the design of the component, are&#13;
summarized in Annex 4. Attached as Annex 5 is the Bank's Environmental Data Sheet.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
2.34         The EMC has also been placed in category "B." The benefits of the EMC would consist&#13;
of: (a) enhanced management and improved public access for the Matsalu State Nature Reserve;&#13;
(b) demonstration of planning and implementation for the catchment area of environmentally sustainable&#13;
management methods; and (c) greater opportunities for environmentally sound tourism in the Haapsalu&#13;
and Matsalu area. Environmental reviews will be prepared as elements of the studies and plans to ensure&#13;
that their objectives and small-scale works are environmentally acceptable. These environmental reviews&#13;
would be subject to evaluation by the MOE, its concerned County Environmental Department and Bank&#13;
environmental specialists.&#13;
2.35         The proposed Project would not involve involuntary resettlement and is not anticipated&#13;
to have an impact on known archaeological or historical sites in Haapsalu or the Matsalu Reserve.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Organization and Management&#13;
3.1          Project Coordination. The GOE's MOE would provide overall coordination and&#13;
supervision of the Project, coordinate actions of funding organizations and local implementing agencies,&#13;
and manage interactions with the Bank. The MOE has appointed a Project Coordinator in the International&#13;
Relations Department to perform this task. This department has national responsibility for coordination&#13;
and supervision of all internationally supported environmental projects, either loan or grant financed,&#13;
including those supported by international financial institutions, the EU and a series of bilateral&#13;
cooperation agreements with foreign governments. In order to facilitate day-to-day implementation of the&#13;
Project, consistent with Estonian decentralization policies, the MOE would delegate most implementation&#13;
responsibilities for the WWIC to the HWW. For the coordination and management of the EMC, MOE&#13;
would be assisted by the HELCOM PITF Working Group on Coastal Lagoons and Wetlands Area Task&#13;
Team (MLW/ATT) established in 1994 for the Matsalu Bay area to initiate and coordinate at the local&#13;
level the implementation of the coastal lagoons and wetlands component of the JCP.&#13;
3.2          Project Steering Committee. To facilitate implementation of the proposed Project, the&#13;
MOE would formally extend the charter of the current Project Steering Committee (PSC) for the project&#13;
preparation to cover project implementation as well. It is anticipated that current members would be&#13;
retained for the benefit of continuity. PSC membership would include representatives of MOE, MOH,&#13;
HWW, Lihula Water Works, Matsalu State Nature Reserve, and Laane, and Rapla Counties. Draft terms&#13;
of reference for the PSC were agreed upon during negotiations (Annex 3C).&#13;
3.3          WWIC. HWW would be responsible for implementation of the water and wastewater&#13;
improvement component. The director of HWW would be responsible for supervision of all Project&#13;
supported activities concerning water and wastewater. To facilitate implementation of this component a&#13;
small Project Implementation Unit (PIU) would be established within HWW. The PIU would be assisted,&#13;
as required, by international consultants to support the preparation of technical specifications, bidding&#13;
documents, tendering, bid evaluation, contract awards, supervision of civil works and equipment&#13;
installation and follow-up activities. Draft terms of reference for the PIU were discussed during Appraisal&#13;
(see Annex 3D). That the PIU has been established with a manager, accountant, and bilingual secretary&#13;
would be a condition for Loan effectiveness (para 6.5 (c)).&#13;
3.4          EMC. This component would be implemented by the MOE, local authorities and WWF.&#13;
The coordination and supervision of the various sub-components would be carried out by the MOE, with&#13;
the assistance of the MLW/ATT. The ATT consists of representatives from the MOE, Matsalu State&#13;
Nature Reserve, the Laane County, the Rapla County, Tallinn Technical University, Estonian Fund for&#13;
Nature, and WWF. A Secretary was appointed to the ATT by the MOE in November 1994. The&#13;
implementation of this component would be carried out in accordance with a work plan and terms of&#13;
reference acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
3.5          Project implementation is anticipated to begin in June 1995 and would be carried out over&#13;
a four-year period. The estimated disbursement period is two years shorter than the Bank's average for&#13;
similar projects because of the Project's small size and limited scope. Bank experience with&#13;
implementation of environmental management and small-scale civil works projects are limited in Central&#13;
and Eastern Europe; however, given the small size of the proposed Project and assessment of Estonian&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
implementation capacity, a four-year implementation appears reasonable. A summary of implementation&#13;
responsibilities for the proposed Project is provided in Annex 1, Chart 2.&#13;
B. Project Implementation Agencies&#13;
3.6          Ministry of Environment. The MOE has a diverse range of responsibilities including&#13;
environmental protection and planning, natural resources management, parks and protected areas&#13;
management, scientific research, and environmental assessment. The MOE has adopted a decentralized&#13;
approach to environmental management and has an established network of County Environment&#13;
Departments which provide local level support for the implementation of its policies and programs.&#13;
3.7          The International Relations Department within the MOE is responsible for the preparation&#13;
of all internationally funded projects. This unit, along with the Nature Protection Department and Water&#13;
Department, has been directly involved in the preparation of the proposed Project, including the review&#13;
and approval of terms of reference, selection and supervision of consultants and review of their studies.&#13;
Based on previous Bank experience in working with the MOE in the context of the Baltic Sea&#13;
Environment Program and on Project preparation to date, it is anticipated that the staff of both&#13;
departments would be capable of successfully supervise the proposed Project.&#13;
3.8          Haapsalu Water Works. The MOE has appointed the HWW to undertake implementation&#13;
of the WWIC. This approach is fully consistent with the policy of the MOE to support the&#13;
decentralization of environmental management responsibilities to local municipalities and to have those&#13;
parties which would be responsible for operation and maintenance of facilities take an active role in their&#13;
design and construction.&#13;
3.9          The HWW is now owned by the Haapsalu local government in accordance with the Law&#13;
on Local Government Arrangement (1993). The legal process of forming a municipal enterprise was&#13;
completed in February 1995. The HWW is managed by a director who has been appointed by the MOH.&#13;
In addition, an advisory board, consisting of members from the City Council, representatives from the&#13;
private sector and the community, is expected to be formed shortly. The utility will be financially&#13;
independent, having its own bank accounts. The authority to approve the budgets for operation and&#13;
maintenance and investments as well as tariffs charged by HWW has been delegated to the MOH by the&#13;
City Council. The MOH would therefore sign the GOE's subsidiary loan agreement jointly with HWW.&#13;
3.10         The HWW employs 44 staff, corresponding to about 3.5 employees for 1,000 customers.&#13;
This is about 3 times more than in western Europe on average. Most of the staff work with the pumping&#13;
stations and perform maintenance service. There is also a financial manager, a bookkeeper, a secretary,&#13;
and personnel for consumer related tasks.&#13;
3.11         Area Task Team. The role of the ATT is to provide an effective framework for the&#13;
coordination of the activities of various local and foreign parties which are participating in implementation&#13;
of EMC activities in Matsalu Bay area. The ATT has been holding meetings on a regular basis which&#13;
have been well attended. These meetings have been used to define priority issues and design management&#13;
actions. Key participants in the ATT include: (a) MOW; (b) Matsalu State Nature Reserve which is&#13;
responsible for implementation of all management activities within the Reserve; (c) Tallinn Technical&#13;
University, working in cooperation with the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, which is&#13;
providing specialized technical support for a wide range of activities in the catchment area;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
(d) cooperating local governments in the Project area; and (e) WWF, which is working with the Reserve&#13;
on implementation of the approved management plan.&#13;
C. Project Supervision&#13;
3.12         The proposed Project would be supervised by Bank staff in accordance with a proposed&#13;
supervision plan summarized in Annex 1, Chart 3. Representatives from MOE and the donors (BITS and&#13;
the Finnish Ministry of Environment) have informed the Bank that they would participate in supervision&#13;
missions. Staff from WWF are also expected to participate in selected missions.&#13;
3.13          Supervision of the proposed Project would be particularly intense during the first two&#13;
years when considerable input would be required for: (a) engineering and procurement aspects of the&#13;
water and wastewater improvement component; and (b) preparation and initial implementation of activities&#13;
under the environmental management component.&#13;
3.14          A mid-term review would be conducted around April 1997 to evaluate overall Project&#13;
progress including progress towards the goal of achieving HWW's financial autonomy, and to assess the&#13;
development and implementation of an amended tariff structure (see terms of reference, Annex 3B).&#13;
During the mid-term review, adjustments would be made in the implementation schedule, if deemed&#13;
necessary, to improve HWW's management capacity, and review the long-term tariff rates based on the&#13;
findings of the tariff study.&#13;
3.15          The MOE seeks to obtain hands-on training of its staff through the supervision process&#13;
and to strengthen its ability to plan and coordinate multi-donor funded environment projects. At the&#13;
request of the MOE, it is planned that Project supported training activities would be open to personnel&#13;
from other locations in Estonia to support the dissemination of knowledge and to prepare them for&#13;
participation in other priority environment projects. In this regard special emphasis would be given to&#13;
training of Estonian personnel in competitive procurement procedures for consultant services, construction&#13;
contracts and equipment. Benefits would also accrue through training in construction supervision to&#13;
improve the quality of civil works and equipment installation, thus avoiding many types of operational&#13;
problems.&#13;
D. Accounts and Audits&#13;
3.16         It was agreed during negotiations that the Project Accounts and the Special Account for&#13;
the WWIC would be audited in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Financial Reporting and&#13;
Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank' (March 1982). It was also agreed that HWW would&#13;
have its records, accounts and financial statements for each fiscal year audited by independent autditors&#13;
acceptable to the Bank and that such audits and copies of itsfinancial statements would be furnished to&#13;
the Bank, no later than six months after the end of each fiscal years (para 6.4 (b)). The audit reports&#13;
would contain separate opinions on: (a) compliance by implementing agencies with all financial covenants&#13;
under the Bank Loan; (b) the statements of expenditure; and (c) the special account. It is expected that&#13;
a local branch of a private, international, commercial auditor, in association with a local auditing firm&#13;
if available, would carry out the audits, and this arrangement is considered acceptable. For the EMC,&#13;
each respective donor would be responsible for the audit of its accounts.&#13;

- 27 -&#13;
3.17          The Project Coordinator, with the support of the manager of the PIU and the ATT&#13;
Secretary for EMC activities, would coordinate the preparation of semi-annual descriptive and financial&#13;
reports on each Project component, objective, and activity (beginning from the date of Loan&#13;
Effectiveness). The Borrower and HWW advised the Bank that they would submit semi-annual reports&#13;
(by March 15 and September 15) to the Bank, concerning the progress of project implementation during&#13;
the preceding semester ending December 31 and June 30, respectively.  It was also agreed that&#13;
preparation of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the whole Project would be carried out&#13;
according to Bank Guidelines.&#13;
3.18         Project monitoring indicators were agreed upon during negotiations. These would be&#13;
continuously monitored and would form the basis of the evolving sector dialogue (Section IV of the PIP&#13;
(Annex 1).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
IV. MANAGEMENT OF FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF HWW&#13;
A. Past Performance and Present Position&#13;
4.1           Overview. HWW was established as a municipally owned water and wastewater enterprise&#13;
in February, 1995 as a part of GOE's broad strategy to decentralize muncipal services. In order to&#13;
become a financially autonomous municipal enterprise, HWW  needs to improve its technology and&#13;
financial management through undertaking complementary investment and institutional strengthening&#13;
activities.&#13;
4.2           Central to its approach of institutional strengthening is development of a formal "twinning&#13;
arrangement" on a contractual basis with an experienced water and wastewater utility under terms of&#13;
reference acceptable to the Bank. This twinning arrangement, funded under the Project, would provide&#13;
support for: utility management; monitoring and use of laboratory data; system investment planning;&#13;
rehabilitation program design; construction supervision; operation and maintenance; tariff setting; billing&#13;
and collection; accounting and auditing; human resources development and public information programs&#13;
(see Annex 3A for the draft terms of reference). The Bank supports alternatives approaches as long as&#13;
the institutional objectives of the Project are achievable. During negotiations, it was agreed that HWWW&#13;
shall not contract management functions to third parties, unless appropriate competitive procedures&#13;
agreed with the Bank have been followed (para 6.3 (b)).&#13;
4.3           Past Performance. Analysis of HWW's financial statements for the years 1991-1993&#13;
shows that the tariff levels were so low in 1991 that the state intervened with subvention of operating&#13;
expenses; in 1992, tariff levels were increased to a level sufficient enough to cover its cash operating&#13;
costs and to a small extent a provision for planned maintenance. In 1993, tariffs were increased but not&#13;
to a level sufficient enough to cover inflation; the utility consequently experienced a deficit. Had the&#13;
accounts properly accounted for charges for other non-cash items, including a provision for bad and&#13;
doubtful debts, and proper asset depreciation reflecting replacement costs revaluation, deficits would have&#13;
been reported for the whole 1991-1993 period. Preliminary 1994 numbers show HWW made minimal&#13;
profits, though again with an undervalued depreciation. HWW's financial performance for the 1991-1993&#13;
period is summarized in Table 9, Annex 1.&#13;
4.4           Historically, GOE has provided financing for all of HWW's capital investment program.&#13;
Consequently, the enterprise has no long term external debt. Most of the short term debt, reflected largely&#13;
in accounts payable, is money owed for electricity supply, natural resource taxes, and pollution taxes.&#13;
Toward the end of 1993 and in early 1994, the financial viability of HWW was hampered by the the&#13;
transfer of state residential, commercial and industrial properties to the private sector, which has&#13;
neglected outstanding liabilities of previous owners who failed to pay their bills. Additionally, industries&#13;
in Haapsalu have experienced financial downturns and consequently regard payment of water bills to be&#13;
low priority.&#13;
4.5           HWW's inability during the past three years to adjust tariffs in a timely manner to&#13;
compensate for inflation, to make proper provisions for future investment and maintenance needs, and&#13;
to compensate for increasing non-payment by consumers has deprived the utility of cash to run its day-to-&#13;
day operations, let alone provide for future investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
B. Tariff Levels and Revenues&#13;
4.6           Water tariffs are currently inadequate to cover full operating and depreciation costs.&#13;
Despite several tariff increases in the last few years, increases have not, since 1992, kept pace with the&#13;
high and erratic periods of inflation and thus have failed to adjust properly to real cost increases. In&#13;
September 1994, the City Council agreed to a combined tariff increase for water to 2.10 kr/rn3 and&#13;
wastewater to 4.40 kr/rn3, which still does not cover full operating and depreciation costs. The tariff&#13;
structure does not include standing charges (only a symbolic connection fee is said to be charged) nor&#13;
incremental charges for higher levels of consumption. All tariffs are either of a simple volumetric form&#13;
or, as is the case for industrial discharges, of a weighted volumetric form. Industrial customers are&#13;
metered, as are approximately 95 percent of domestic customers. Wastewater tariffs are generally applied&#13;
on the basis of consumed (metered or estimated) water, rather than accurate sewerage metering. The only&#13;
exceptions are those for large industrial customers which use considerable volumes of water in the&#13;
production process, for which a revised "return rate" is agreed, or for those who possess their own water&#13;
supply, in which case the private supply is metered and a "reduced" charge calculated. In the institutional&#13;
strengthening component, consisting of the twinning arrangement, assistance for tariff planning and&#13;
financial operations would be provided based on the results of the tariff study (see TOR, Annex 3B).&#13;
4.7          During negotiations, it was agreed that: (a) a tariff study would be carried out by March&#13;
31, 1996 under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank; (b) HWW would achieve the tariff level&#13;
recommended by the study by June 30, 1996; and (c) tariffs would be increased by 19% in real terms by&#13;
the end of calendar year 1995 (para 6.3 (c)).&#13;
C. Billing and Collection&#13;
4.8           HWW's billing and collection procedures are only partly computerized; consumers are&#13;
divided into: (a) residential customers; and (b) industrial consumers (including schools, hospitals, offices&#13;
and shops). At present, residential and industrial customers pay the same tariff. HWW formerly&#13;
differentiated between households and industry for wastewater fees. Since 1994, however, the base fee&#13;
is the same for both kinds of users.&#13;
4.9           The collection process is administratively burdensome but has so far been adequate given&#13;
that the debt ratio does not exceed 10 percent of average total revenues. This only corresponds to about&#13;
a month's payment. The amount of average yearly debts have increased at the same rate as Estonia's&#13;
internal inflation. Good collection history has been encouraged by HWW's policy of turning off the water&#13;
from non-paying consumers. At the end of 1993, however, industrial consumer debt had increased,&#13;
attributed largely to bankruptcy amongst companies, while the households fulfilled their payment&#13;
obligations relatively better.&#13;
D. Accounting System&#13;
4.10          HWW  has overhauled its former command accounting system to an internationally&#13;
recognized accrual accounting system. However, there remain a number of accounting procedural&#13;
deficiencies, including fixed asset revaluation procedures, proper general ledger preparations, and other&#13;
account transactions. Additionally, the computerized system requires upgrading. The required support to&#13;
improve the financial management of HWW would be provided under the twinning arrangement. To&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
facilitate improved control of HWW's finances, the Project proposes to support the implementation of&#13;
an automated accounting system linked to various Management Information System (MIS).&#13;
E. Financial Issues&#13;
4.11         Accounts Receivable. HWW's accounts receivable as a percentage of gross revenue&#13;
improved significantly from 1993 to 1994, decreasing from 13.8 percent to 7.4 percent respectively,&#13;
However, HWW does not maintain comprehensive information on accounts receivable. Under the Action&#13;
Plan, it was agreed at negotiations that HWW by January 1, 1996, would: (a) produce a comprehensive&#13;
statement of accounts receivable by consumer category and age; (b) implement a program for the effective&#13;
recovery of outstanding accounts; and (c) include a provision in the income statement for non-performing&#13;
receivables (para 6.3 (d)).&#13;
4.12          Debt. The proposed financing plan for HWW  would yield a debt-equity ratio which&#13;
averages approximately 30 percent during the Project lifetime and never exceeds 50 percent.&#13;
Consequently, HWW would not be in an over-leveraged position during the life of the Project. To insure&#13;
financial stability, agreement was reached during negotiations that the utility, during the Project&#13;
implementation period, not incur any debt, unless its net cash generated5 for the fiscal year immediately&#13;
preceding the date of such incurrence (orfor a later twelve-month period ended prior to such incurrence,&#13;
whichever is the greater amount) shall be at least 1.5 times the total estimated debt service requirements&#13;
for any succeedingfiscal year including the debt to be incurred (para 6.3 (e)). The preceding assurances,&#13;
together with the financial covenant proposed in para. 4.16, should ensure that HWW would have&#13;
sufficient funds to meet annual investment requirements. As an added insurance to H!WW's liquid position,&#13;
it was agreed during negotiations that no dividends would be distributed until June 30, 1999 (para 6.3&#13;
.t9)&#13;
4.13         Asset Revaluations. HWW's historical statements are not readily comparable with present&#13;
financial performance, and despite a major asset revaluation in December 1992 and tariff increases,&#13;
proper charges for depreciation are not made against revenue. This emphasizes the need, particularly in&#13;
periods of high or erratic inflation, for regular adjustments to tariff and asset values to ensure proper&#13;
funding for asset replacement. Additionally, it is desirable that a more comprehensive asset revaluation&#13;
be carried out to provide an acceptable estimate of HWW's assets, based on current replacement costs&#13;
and their physical condition. Given that a proper asset revaluation is an expensive exercise and likely to&#13;
take time HWW could revalue its assets based on a limited physical inventory used to assess replacement&#13;
value. The entire inventory would consequently be adjusted accordingly. This revaluation exercise is&#13;
included in the termns of reference for the tariff study.&#13;
F. Future Financial Performance&#13;
4.14          The projections show that the water and sewerage operations will be financially&#13;
sustaining, provided: (a) the revenue projections are fulfilled; (b) water and sewerage tariffs are&#13;
periodically adjusted to maintain the objective of full debt service cost recovery; (c) accounts receivable&#13;
are sustained (payments outstanding are at an acceptable level of under 1 month); (d) adequate levels of&#13;
5      Net cash generated equals net cash flow minus Bank debt service.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
sustained maintenance are provided; and (e) the reorganization, training, and technical assistance&#13;
proposals are implemented to promote operating efficiency and cost reductions. The projections show that&#13;
with the prescribed tariff adjustments presented above, the utility would generate sufficient funds to cover&#13;
the debt service obligations (it exceeds 1.5 from year 1994 through 2005). Financial projections for the&#13;
water supply and sewerage system are presented in Appendix 1 of Annex 1.&#13;
4.15          Projections of HWW's financial performance assume that its future, outstanding long term&#13;
debt obligation is only that owed to the Bank in an amount totalling US$ 2.0 million. This requires tariff&#13;
adjustments over the 1995-1999 period, as presented in Table 4.1 below, that are structured to allow the&#13;
utility to achieve a cash flow level adequate enough to:&#13;
-      service debt obligations at a cash flow generation level which does not allow the&#13;
debt service coverage ratio to fall below 1.5 each year;&#13;
-      achieve a working ratio6 of 50 percent or below;&#13;
-      achieve an operating ratio7 below 85 percent; and&#13;
-      achieve a return on assets' of at least 10 percent.&#13;
4.16          Assurances were obtained during negotiations that: (a) HWW would maintain for each&#13;
of its fiscal years after its fiscal year ending on December 31, 1995, a ratio of total operating expenses&#13;
to total operating revenues below 85 percent; and (b) before November 30 in each of the fiscal years,&#13;
n'WW would furnish to the Bank a review of whether is would meeti the requirements in respect of such&#13;
year and the next year (para 6.3 (g)). Tariffs are set by MOH who would jointly with the HWW sign&#13;
the subsidiary loan agreement with the Borrower.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
G. Tariff Affordability&#13;
4.17          Current combined tariffs correspond to EEK 6.50/m3 for both domestic and industrial&#13;
customers, which represents approximately 2.6 percent of the monthly average household income. Given&#13;
the estimated real tariff increase of approximately 95 percent over a period of five years and a real&#13;
income growth, the water service tariffs are estimated to correspond to an average of approximately 3.7&#13;
percent of the average household income. In general, water and wastewater tariffs consisting of 34&#13;
percent of average household income are considered acceptable. It should be noted that households in&#13;
Estonia often have undeclared income that is not reflected in the income level used in this affordability&#13;
calculation. Affordability and the possibility of extending the social safety net to the lowest income&#13;
categories were reviewed and discussed in detail with MOH during appraisal. Assumptions underlying&#13;
the affordability estimates are presented in Annex 6.&#13;
H. Financial Viability&#13;
4.18          HWW's financial sustainability would be achieved by implementation of a tariff level that&#13;
would allow it to generate a cash flow sufficient enough to meet the financial objectives outlined in para.&#13;
4.15. These would collectively ensure HWW's ability to service debt obligations, provide proper&#13;
provisions for depreciation of revalued assets, and bad and doubtful debts, and generate sufficient net&#13;
profits to yield a 10 percent or higher return on assets.&#13;
4.19          Additional Project benefits are externalities which cannot easily be quantified nor&#13;
incorporated into HWW's finance rate of return analysis. These include direct environmental benefits and&#13;
indirect financial benefits to the regional economy from improved environment quality, management of&#13;
important ecosystems and increased tourism.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
V. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Project Benefits&#13;
5.1          In addition to the improved quality and quantity of water supply and sewerage services&#13;
accruing to the customers, the proposed Project generates economic benefits to the environment and&#13;
surrounding region that are not possible to quantify. Both quantifiable and non-quantifiable benefits are&#13;
discussed below.&#13;
5.2          Supply Improvement and Environmental Enhancement. The WWIC would provide benefits&#13;
to the residents of Haapsalu and its surrounding region by improving water and wastewater services and&#13;
environmental conditions. Benefits include improvements to maintain a high quality and more reliable&#13;
drinking water supply, reduced wastewater discharges to the Baltic Sea around Haapsalu, surface waters&#13;
of Haapsalu and Matsalu Bays and adjacent Baltic beaches, thus lowering health risks and frequency of&#13;
beach closures, improving aesthetic conditions, and increasing recreational and tourism opportunities in&#13;
the area. An additional benefit would be the improved quality of the curative mud reserves.&#13;
5.3          The proposed Project would also support the commitments of the GOE, as a party to the&#13;
Helsinki Convention, to fulfill the recommendations of the JCP by reducing land-based pollution of the&#13;
Baltic Sea from a priority "hot spot." The measures included in the Project would reduce the current&#13;
BOD7 emissions from 346 tons/year to 62 tons/year, suspended solids from 216 tons/year to 48 tons/year&#13;
and phosphorus from 16 tons/year to 1.5 tons/year. These results would fulfill the application of&#13;
"HELCOM Recommendations".&#13;
5.4          Employment Impact, Human Skills Improvement and Institutional Development. The&#13;
proposed Project would strengthen the MOE's capacity to coordinate and implement environmental&#13;
projects and support its efforts to decentralize implementation and management of environment projects&#13;
to local authorities. It would provide for direct short-term employment benefits for Estonian technical&#13;
experts, skilled construction workers and laborers. At the technical level, the WWIC would provide&#13;
opportunities for Estonian experts to gain direct practical experience in the design, construction,&#13;
operation, and maintenance of the modem water and wastewater system.  In a longer term, an&#13;
autonomous utility could attract private capital including equity.&#13;
5.5          It is expected that organizational restructuring, technical assistance, and investment would&#13;
strengthen HWW's managerial efficiency, financial viability, service quality, and capacity to plan and&#13;
implement investments. This should eventually result in cost containment and well-structured tariffs.&#13;
Moreover, the concept of managerial accountability would be introduced to a wider audience than HWW,&#13;
including the MOH and the local industry. Consumers would potentially benefit from the efficiency gains&#13;
generated by the restructuring process in terms of better water and wastewater services.&#13;
5.6          Social and Other Benefits. From  a socio-economic perspective, environmental&#13;
improvements in Haapsalu are justified by direct benefits to the residents, seasonal domestic and foreign&#13;
tourists, and local and foreign visitors to health facilities which feature the curative mud of Haapsalu Bay.&#13;
Several options exist for having these beneficiaries provide funding for the environmental improvements&#13;
through the application of user fees for tourists and health facilities that benefit from the Project.&#13;
5.7          Institution Building Benefits. The proposed Project would support HWW's operation as&#13;
an autonomous water and wastewater utility to efficiently meet the long-term water and wastewater&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
service needs of Haapsalu. A major benefit would come from institutional strengthening and human&#13;
resources development activities, undertaken through "twinning arrangements" and "hands-on" experience&#13;
in developing new skills required for administrative, financial, technical and environmental aspects of&#13;
water and wastewater utility operation. Implementation of the proposed Project would also provide for&#13;
real cost data for investments in the water and wastewater facilities which would be of significant&#13;
importance in development of reliable cost-estimates for future projects.&#13;
5.8          Demonstration Activities. The EMC would support a series of demonstration activities to&#13;
prevent future adverse environmental impacts through improved management practices and the use of&#13;
cost-efficient point and non-point source pollution control methods for small settlements and agriculture.&#13;
The EMC would also support the demonstration of ecological engineering techniques, including the use&#13;
of constructed wetlands, for control of pollution from various types of sources on the Matsalu Bay&#13;
catchment. These activities will be carefully monitored and will be the subject of an evaluation study to&#13;
assess the effectiveness of various types of interventions, their investment, operation and maintenance&#13;
costs, and suitability for replication elsewhere in the country.&#13;
5.9           The MOE expects that the catchment area management and tourism development planning&#13;
activities would provide a critical base of local experience and allow for training of Estonian experts in&#13;
order for this type of work to be conducted in other areas of the country. In the case of the planning and&#13;
implementation actions for protected areas, it is anticipated by the MOE and local authorities that these&#13;
would provide demonstrations which could be replicated in other areas of Estonia.&#13;
5.10          A Matsalu case study of the economic impact of protected areas is being cooperatively&#13;
prepared by the MOE and the Bank. This is expected to be finalized by the end of calendar year 1995,&#13;
and would provide valuable information on the economic benefits of proper management and access to&#13;
these areas. This study would review both direct and indirect revenues from local and international&#13;
tourism and assess their benefit to the local economy; it would also assess possible measures to access&#13;
a portion of the receipts financing environmental management activities.&#13;
5.11          Community Participation. The EMC involves community participation in implementation&#13;
of ecosystem management activities at the Matsalu State Nature Reserve. These activities would include&#13;
the direct participation of local farmers in decisions and activities concerning the management of local&#13;
man-made landscapes, planned grazing of coastal meadows, controlled burning, and reed harvesting and&#13;
marketing operations. The management activities at the Reserve have been designed to provide local&#13;
residents an opportunity to directly benefit economically from these interventions. The development of&#13;
the Catchment Management Plan and implementation of the activities to manage point and non-point&#13;
source pollution would also be developed and conducted with the direct participation of representatives&#13;
of local settlements and agricultural complexes. The activities to support the development of eco-tourism&#13;
in the region would place an emphasis on home and farm-based tourism to maximize benefits to local&#13;
residents. In addition, Estonian academic institutions and applied research institutes such as Tallinn&#13;
Technical University, local non-governmental organizations and the WWF are to be involved in the&#13;
implementation of the EMC.&#13;
5.12         Replication of EMC Activities. These activities would provide both governmental and&#13;
nongovernmental organizations with an important learning experience which could be replicated elsewhere&#13;
in Estonia and the Baltic region. In addition to the strictly local environmental benefits, the Project would&#13;
have regional benefits for the Baltic Sea and would benefit global biodiversity through the conservation&#13;
of some of the most important natural areas and traditional landscapes of the eastern Baltic Sea coastline&#13;
and support the protection of critical habitat for native and migratory bird species.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
B. Project Risks&#13;
5.13          Slippage. With regard to the WWIC, there is a limited risk that Project implementation&#13;
would encounter delays due to limited experience in the use of international procurement procedures. In&#13;
addition, given the limited technical experience with actual costs for implementation of water and&#13;
wastewater improvements in post-Soviet Estonia, the volatility of local price changes, and previous lack&#13;
of construction activities to international standards in this sector, construction costs may be&#13;
underestimated. In order to minimize these risks, the Project would provide for the establishment of a&#13;
strong PIU, adoption of conservative approaches to cost estimation combined with appropriate physical&#13;
and price contingencies, and provision of significant technical and procurement support from Bank staff&#13;
during supervision both from headquarters and the regional office.&#13;
5.14          On the basis of previous Bank experience in Eastern Europe there is also a risk that the&#13;
GOE and cooperating local governments may have problems with the timely provision of local currency&#13;
support and availability of adequately qualified personnel for Project management, the latter due to&#13;
government limits on salaries paid to civil servants. These risks would be reduced through close&#13;
supervision and quick actions to address these types of implementation problems should they occur.&#13;
5.15          Institutional and Financial. On the institutional and financial side, the main risks would&#13;
be the commitment of the Haapsalu City Council to allow the HWW to function as an independent utility&#13;
which, interalia, may interfere with HWW's ability to adjust tariffs sufficiently to cover its costs,&#13;
including the repayment of the Bank Loan. These risks can only be partially mitigated through Project&#13;
supervision, as MOH is an independent body subject to political and social pressures. MOH can be made&#13;
aware of the consequence of its decisions on tariffs through the dialogue afforded by supervision, the&#13;
tariff study, and the requested presentation of annual HWW budgets. That MOH jointly with HWW signs&#13;
the GOE's subsidiary loan agreement will serve to lower the risk of significant deviations from a rational&#13;
tariff policy.&#13;
5.16          Technology and Management. The WWIC technology is standard and involves no unusual&#13;
risks. The main risk is the utility's financial and institutional capability, requiring substantial&#13;
strengthening of its financial and managerial capability. Experience with other municipal water and&#13;
wastewater authorities in transitional economies demonstrates that close Project supervision and adequate&#13;
technical assistance mitigate these risks. The proposed technologies to be demonstrated under the EMC&#13;
for the control of point and non-point source pollution from small settlements and agriculture are simple,&#13;
and have been tested under similar conditions in the Nordic countries and North America. The use of&#13;
ecological engineering methods would allow for the adaptation of a variety of low-cost methods, including&#13;
constructed wetlands, under Estonian conditions. A number of Estonian environmental specialists,&#13;
associated with both applied research and consulting firms, have knowledge of these technologies and&#13;
some demonstration work has already been undertaken by specialists from Tartu University.&#13;
5.17          The principal risks for the EMC concern: (a) difficulties in coordination of activities&#13;
between various national, local, non-governmental, and consultant organizations; (b) resistance from local&#13;
authorities and residents to proposed land use control measures to be included in the catchment area and&#13;
Matsalu State Nature Reserve management plans; (c) a reluctance of local authorities and agriculturalists&#13;
to adopt new low-cost technologies for the control of pollution; and (d) unanticipated problems associated&#13;
with the complex issues of restitution of lands confiscated by the State during the Soviet period to their&#13;
pre-1940 owners.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
5.18          Coordination issues are expected to be addressed effectively by the establishment of&#13;
smaller implementation teams each acting with the support of the Project Coordinator and the ATT&#13;
Secretary, complemented by close Bank supervision. Resistance to implementation due to land use&#13;
constraints and conflicts with pre-1940 land owners can only be addressed by having the direct&#13;
participation of these parties, as proposed in the planning and implementation of these activities. It should&#13;
be noted that the demonstration activities by their very nature are intended to test the application of these&#13;
approaches in the Estonian context and to provide lessons which can be transferred elsewhere within the&#13;
country and the Baltic Sea region.&#13;
&#13;

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
I. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.           This draft Project Implementation Plan (PIP) was finalized during appraisal and&#13;
confirmed by the Borrower in accordance with procedures set out in the OP/BP/GB 10.00'. A complete&#13;
Project design is presented as an overview in Chart 1.&#13;
B. Project Scope and Objectives&#13;
2.            The Haapsalu and Matsalu Bays Environment Project (the Project), which would be the&#13;
first Bank funded environmental investment project in Estonia, would have the following main objectives:&#13;
*      strengthen the MOE's capacity to coordinate and implement environmental projects;&#13;
*      reduce discharge of partially treated and untreated wastewater into the Baltic Sea;&#13;
*      restore and enhance the surface and groundwater quality in Haapsalu;&#13;
*      improve quality, reliability and cost efficiency of water supply and sanitation services in&#13;
Haapsalu;&#13;
*      improve the operational efficiency and management system in the HWW;&#13;
*     promote management of point and non-point source pollution from the catchment area of&#13;
Matsalu Bay; and&#13;
*     promote environmentally sustainable management and development of ecologically unique&#13;
and sensitive areas around Matsalu Bay and adjacent coastal areas.&#13;
C. Project Description&#13;
3.            The proposed Project would be implemented over four years as an environmental&#13;
management project for the coastal area of Estonia. The main components of the Project would be:&#13;
*      rehabilitation, upgrading and expansion of the Haapsalu water and wastewater system,&#13;
including equipment and works, engineering services, and measures to reduce water&#13;
demand;&#13;
I     OPR issued new procedures on September 17, 1993 requiring that an Implementation Plan be prepared and included&#13;
in the Staff Appraisal Report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 2&#13;
*      training to support institutional strengthening to assist in establishing an autonomous and&#13;
financially independent water and wastewater utility in Haapsalu. This would include&#13;
twinning arrangements that incorporate consultancy and advisory services, training,&#13;
equipment and software. Twinning would also cover the water and wastewater enterprise&#13;
of the nearby town of Lihula;&#13;
*      technical and financial support for the implementation, of a management plan for the&#13;
Matsalu State Nature Reserve proposed by a joint Estonian-WWF team, focussing on&#13;
improvements to make selected sites more readily accessible for domestic and foreign&#13;
visitors;&#13;
*      support for the development of a management plan for the Matsalu Bay catchment area,&#13;
including measures to upgrade wastewater treatment services at Lihula and other small&#13;
settlements and reduce surface and groundwater pollution from agricultural run-off; and&#13;
*      support for planning and management of eco-tourism, including an evaluation of adaptive&#13;
reuse of the Matsalu Manor and its outbuildings as a multi-purpose facility for use by the&#13;
Matsalu State Nature Reserve.&#13;
4.            Water and Wastewater Improvement Component (WWIC)2. The component would&#13;
address the following water and wastewater system improvements in Haapsalu:&#13;
e      Water Supply and Distribution&#13;
(a)    connection of new borewells in the southern part of the town with the main&#13;
pipeline system by installing new pipe mains in Toostuse, Tamme, Raudtee and&#13;
Kalda Streets;&#13;
(b)    renewal of pumps now requiring high maintenance; and&#13;
(c)    introduction of automatic control system at the major water wells.&#13;
*      Sewerage and Wastewater Treatment&#13;
(a)    extension of sewerage network to cover areas now served by septic tanks, or&#13;
having a direct discharge of untreated wastewater to the Baltic Sea;&#13;
(b)    rehabilitation of pumping stations;&#13;
(c)    connection of Pikk-holm sewerage area;&#13;
(d)    reconstruction of sewerage system; and&#13;
2      Detailed information concerning the WWIC is available in "Haapsalu Water and Wastewater Project - Feasibility&#13;
Study" prepared by SWECO in association with Eesti Projekt, Tallinn and Bohlin &amp; Stromberg, Stockholm for HWW.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX I&#13;
Page 3&#13;
(e)   reconstruction of the wastewater treatment plant to meet "HELCOM&#13;
Recommendations'.&#13;
Consulting Services&#13;
(a)   technical assistance for Project implementation for coordination and construction&#13;
supervision of above works;&#13;
(b)   technical assistance for institutional development for strengthening the&#13;
organizational arrangements through a twinning arrangement with a reputable&#13;
foreign water and wastewater utility under terms of reference acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. The main objective of this sub-component is to improve the HWW's&#13;
overall performance through changes in operational and financial management in&#13;
accordance with the Action Plan. The twinning partner would support and assist&#13;
HWW in implementing the Plan with regard to institutional strengthening and&#13;
human resources development for the first two years of the Project&#13;
implementation period. Areas of assistance include support for:&#13;
(i)   implementing a system rehabilitation and optimization program;&#13;
(ii)   developing and initiating implementation of a consumer interaction&#13;
program; and&#13;
(iii)  implementing the proposed recording and information system.&#13;
5.           The amount of wastewater currently pumped to the treatment plant is on average 5,500&#13;
m3/day, including infiltration of ground water. Of this is 2,300 m3/day drainage and 2,700 m3/day&#13;
municipal wastewater. It is estimated that an additional 675 m3/day of municipal wastewater is discharged&#13;
directly to the Baltic Sea.&#13;
6.           The proposed Project would reduce the total BOD emission from Haapsalu by about 87 %&#13;
or 234 tons/year. When the wastewater treatment plant has been reconstructed, additional wastewater&#13;
discharges, currently not included in the Project, will be able to be conveyed and treated without&#13;
increasing the size of the plant. The plants final capacity will be designed for 23,000 population&#13;
equivalents (pe) compared to the current situation, which is 13,600 pe.&#13;
7.           Environmental Management Component (EMC). The Ministry of Environment (MOE),&#13;
representatives of the Matsalu State Nature Reserve and local authorities reviewed and endorsed a&#13;
program of environmental management activities to be undertaken in Matsalu Bay and its catchment area&#13;
to complement improvements being taken to improve environmental quality in Haapsalu Bay. The EMC&#13;
would include the following complementary activities: (a) implementation of priority actions included&#13;
under the management plan for the Matsalu State Nature Reserve; (b) a special program for management&#13;
of point and non-point source pollution from the Matsalu Bay catchment; and (c) support for selected eco-&#13;
tourism activities. These activities would support protection of the fragile ecosystem of Matsalu Bay;&#13;
provide an opportunity for the demonstration of a variety of cost-effective pollution control methods on&#13;
the large catchment area of Matsalu Bay; and assist local authorities in the planning and promotion of&#13;
ecotourism activities. Implementation of the EMC would include the participation of the staff of the&#13;
MOE, the Matsalu State Nature Reserve, representatives from county and local governments, Tallinn&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;

Technical University, experts from various Danish and Swedish environment related organizations, the&#13;
WWF-Baltic Regional Program and WWF-Dernark. Activities to be supported under the EMC include:&#13;
Activity No. 1. Management Plan for Matsalu State Nature Reserve - Support for&#13;
Implementation of Priority Actions. The proposed Project would support the&#13;
implementation of selected priority elements of the approved management plan for the&#13;
Matsalu State Nature Reserve. This plan has identified a large number of actions which&#13;
should be taken to maintain key habitats of significance to permanent and migratory&#13;
wildlife; protect and enhance the diversity of plant ecosystems; improve the infrastructure&#13;
of the Reserve for management and visitor access, support the acquisition of specialized&#13;
equipment needed for management activities; and provide transport and other equipment&#13;
for effective ranger patrol and technical monitoring programs. The activity would have&#13;
two complementary elements:&#13;
(a)    Ecosystem Management Program. Under this element, activities would be&#13;
supported which would address improve the maintenance of key ecosystems&#13;
through active management programs including the removal of trees and bushes&#13;
which have invaded coastal meadows, re-establishment of maintenance oriented&#13;
grazing programs in cooperation with local farmers, and reed harvesting&#13;
programs to reduce eutrophication and slow the filling of the bay. This would&#13;
also include provision of critical equipment required for management and ranger&#13;
patrol activities. The EU (PHARE) has approved a grant of 250,000 ECU (US&#13;
$300,000 equivalent) to support implementation of these actions. The funds are&#13;
being administered by WWF-Denmark under a contract.&#13;
(b)    Provision of Specialized Equipment and Selected Investments. This element would&#13;
include support for the procurement of special large machines for reed cutting,&#13;
small equipment for vegetation maintenance and selected investments to improve&#13;
visitor access. The Government of Denmark is currently considering a proposal&#13;
from WWF-Denmark, with the support of the MOE, to provide a grant of&#13;
US $250,000 for the procurement of this specialized equipment from Danish&#13;
manufacturers and to provide funding for local improvements.&#13;
*     Activity No. 2. Management of Point and Non-Point Source Pollution from the Matsalu&#13;
Bay Catchment. The proposed activity would support the development, implementation,&#13;
monitoring and evaluation of a program of activities to reduce point and non-point source&#13;
pollution on the Matsalu Bay catchment. This activity would provide an opportunity for&#13;
a properly monitored and evaluated demonstration program to evaluate the use of a&#13;
variety of cost-effective approaches and technologies for the control of point and non-&#13;
point source pollution from small settlements and agricultural activities in the catchment&#13;
area. The findings from this program of demonstration activities would be applicable to&#13;
other locations in Estonia and the eastern Baltic Sea basin. An important aspect of the&#13;
demonstration program would be that it would provide field based data concerning the&#13;
effectiveness of various types of approaches and allow for the development of investment&#13;
and operation and maintenance cost figures for these types of interventions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX I&#13;
Page 5&#13;
The proposed activity would include four complementary elements:&#13;
(a)   Inventory Study and Catchment Management Plan. The proposed Project would&#13;
include support for:&#13;
(i)   Inventory Study. A detailed point and non-point source inventory study&#13;
on the Matsalu Bay catchment would be prepared under the ongoing&#13;
Swedish Ministry of Environment supported joint Estonian-Swedish&#13;
Study on the Management of the Matsalu Bay Catchment. It would&#13;
provide a framework for the identification of additional actions which&#13;
should be taken to control pollution from the catchment area, support&#13;
evaluation of impacts from specific locations and facilitate assessment of&#13;
benefits from various types of remedial and preventative pollution control&#13;
measures. The study would be prepared by Tallinn Technical University&#13;
with support from the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. The&#13;
estimated cost for the study is SEK 100,000 (US $12,500 equivalent) and&#13;
would take from 12-18 months to prepare.&#13;
(ii)   Catchment Management Plan. The study would be prepared by Tallinn&#13;
Technical University with support from the Swedish Environmental&#13;
Protection Agency. The estimated cost for the study is SEK 100,000 (US&#13;
$12,500) and would take from 12-18 months to prepare following&#13;
completion of the Inventory Study and would benefit from data collected&#13;
from the first stage of activities for the control of point and non-point&#13;
source pollution discussed below.&#13;
(b)    Point Source Pollution Control. This element of the activity would support a&#13;
series of demonstration activities for the control of pollution from point sources,&#13;
principally small settlements and large agricultural and agro-industrial complexes,&#13;
on the Matsalu Bay catchment. An emphasis would be given to the demonstration&#13;
of a variety of different low-cost treatment methods, including the ecological&#13;
engineering techniques, with the intention of having those which are most&#13;
effective replicated at other locations in Estonia. This element would include&#13;
actions at the following locations which have been identified as priority sites by&#13;
MOE in consultation with the Joint Estonian-Swedish study team, staff from the&#13;
Matsalu Reserve and representatives of local government:&#13;
(i)    Matsalu Bay Catchment - North Section.&#13;
*     Martna Settlement. Would serve as a demonstration site for&#13;
ecological engineering approaches. Preliminary estimated cost is&#13;
EEK 850,000 (US $70,000 equivalent).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 6&#13;
(ii)    Matsalu Bay Catchment - East Section - Kasari River Basin.3&#13;
*      Kirbla Settlement and Farn. This site due to  geological&#13;
conditions is not suitable for ecological engineering techniques.&#13;
The proposed Project would identify and implement low cost&#13;
techniques for either the rehabilitation or replacement of the&#13;
existing facility. Preliminary estimated cost is EEK 950,000&#13;
(US $75,000 equivalent).&#13;
*      Kuusiki Village. Would serve as a demonstration site for&#13;
ecological engineering approaches. Preliminary estimated cost is&#13;
EEK 300,000 (US $25,000 equivalent)&#13;
*      Roude Settlement. Would serve as a demonstration site for&#13;
ecological engineering approaches. Preliminary estimated cost is&#13;
EEK 500,000 (US $40,000 equivalent).&#13;
*      Saidla Ecological Farm. This site would be evaluated for its&#13;
potential for ecological engineering approaches. If these are not&#13;
viable then the proposed Project would identify and implement&#13;
low cost techniques for either the rehabilitation or replacement&#13;
of the existing facility. Preliminary estimated cost is&#13;
EEK 450,000 (US $35,000 equivalent).&#13;
*      Kullamaa Settlement and Farm. This site, due to geological&#13;
conditions, is not suitable for ecological engineering techniques.&#13;
The proposed Project would identify and implement low cost&#13;
techniques for either the rehabilitation or replacement of the&#13;
existing facility. Preliminary estimated cost is EEK 1,250,000&#13;
(US $80,000) equivalent.&#13;
(iii)    Matsalu Bay Catchment - South Section.&#13;
*      Lihula Town. Support for improvements in the water and&#13;
wastewater services of Lihula, the major settlement on the&#13;
southern catchment of Matsalu Bay, would be partially provided&#13;
by Finland as a contribution to the proposed Project. Preliminary&#13;
estimated cost is EEK 9,500,000 (US $750,000 equivalent) for&#13;
these activities. The Finnish contribution is estimated at&#13;
US $220,000. The remainder would be provided by the GOE.&#13;
3      Support for improvements in the water and wastewater services of Rapla, the major settlement on the upper catchment&#13;
of Matsalu Bay, would be included under the EBRD funded Estonia - Small Municipalities Environment Project. The proposed&#13;
Project is in its final phase of preparation and currently includes a projected budget of 10 million EEK (US $800,000 equivalent)&#13;
for these activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 7&#13;
*     Tuudi-Liva Settlement and Farm. This site would be evaluated&#13;
for its potential for ecological engineering approaches. If these&#13;
are not viable then the proposed Project would identify and&#13;
implement low cost techniques for either the rehabilitation or&#13;
replacement of the existing facility. Preliminary estimated cost&#13;
is EEK 950,000 (US $75,000 equivalent).&#13;
(c)    Non-Point Source Pollution Control. This element would provide support for a&#13;
series of demonstration activities for the control of pollution from non-point&#13;
sources on the Matsalu Bay catchment. The proposed Project would include two&#13;
activities which are elements of the Swedish Ministry of Environment funded&#13;
Baltic Agricultural Run-off Action Program (BAAP), which is a Swedish&#13;
contribution to the implementation of the Baltic Sea Environment Program. The&#13;
program focuses on implementation of environmentally sound management&#13;
practices in agriculture with an emphasis on the demonstration of appropriate&#13;
technology and methods complemented by capacity building and training. The&#13;
proposed Project would include two activities supported under the BAAP;&#13;
however, the scope of these activities may be expanded subject to additional&#13;
funds being made available to BAAP or other donors providing support for&#13;
control of non-point source pollution. The following actions would be included&#13;
under the proposed Project:&#13;
(i)    Baltic Agricultural Run-off Action Program  - Extension of the&#13;
Demonstration and Monitoring Activity to the Matsalu Bay Catchment.&#13;
This would include the extension of the ongoing demonstration program,&#13;
jointly managed by the Swedish Institute of Agricultural Engineering and&#13;
Tallinn Technical University, to include one or more demonstration areas&#13;
in the Matsalu Bay Catchment. It is currently planned that the first&#13;
demonstration activity would be in the eastern part of the basin near&#13;
Rapla. The estimated cost for this activity is SEK  1.5 million&#13;
(US $205,000 equivalent).&#13;
(ii)   Baltic Agricultural Run-off Action Program - Ecological Agriculture&#13;
Demonstration Activity. This would include the effective integration of&#13;
the recently approved ecological agriculture demonstration program into&#13;
the management process for the Matsalu Bay catchment. This activity is&#13;
being jointly prepared by the Rural Development Group of Sweden in&#13;
cooperation with locally based Estonian counterparts. The program aims&#13;
to create ecological model farms in the Rapla region including one&#13;
former state farm and one family farm. Mineral fertilizers and&#13;
conventional pesticides and herbicides will not be used at all in&#13;
agricultural production at these farms. The cost of this activity is&#13;
SEK 750,000 (US $100,000 equivalent).&#13;
(d)    Monitoring and Evaluation. In order to assess the impacts from interventions and&#13;
determine their potential replicability, a supplemental monitoring program and&#13;
an evaluation of impacts from Project supported activities. Basic monitoring from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 8&#13;
the Matsalu Bay catchment would be conducted by the MOE following the&#13;
revision of their national monitoring program on the basis of recommendations&#13;
from the United States Environmental Protection Agency and EU (PHARE)&#13;
study. This would be complemented by selected monitoring activities being&#13;
conducted under the joint Estonian-Swedish study. If necessary, a supplemental&#13;
monitoring program would be supported by the Project to provide additional data&#13;
which may be necessary to determine the impact of management and investment&#13;
interventions to reduce pollution in the catchment area. An Evaluation Study&#13;
would also be prepared during the last year of the proposed Project to provide&#13;
a preliminary assessment of the impacts from various types of Project supported&#13;
activities. The Evaluation Study would examine the costs and benefit of activities,&#13;
review operation and maintenance costs, and make recommendations concerning&#13;
their replication or extension within and outside the catchment area.&#13;
Activity No. 3. Supportfor Planning and Management of Eco-Tourism. The proposed&#13;
activity would support, in coordination with MOE, the Matsalu State Nature Reserve, and&#13;
concerned county governments a series of small-scale actions to support the planning and&#13;
management of eco-tourism in Laane County. Consistent with current GOE policies,&#13;
under this activity emphasis would be given to the development of tourism in Haapsalu&#13;
which would be complemented with by the development of farm and rural settlement&#13;
based tourism. Several donors have been contacted regrading support for this activity,&#13;
the University of Helsinki is currently awaiting a decision by the Government of Finland&#13;
concerning the funding of the study for adaptive reuse of the Matsalu Manor. Under the&#13;
proposed Project, support would be provided for the following actions:&#13;
(a)    Eco-Tourism Planning and Information. Under the proposed Project support&#13;
would be provided to concerned parties in Laane County, including the&#13;
Municipality of Haapsalu, concerning the effective planning of eco-tourism in the&#13;
region. It would support evaluation of measures to be adopted by local authorities&#13;
to assure that the development of both land and marine based tourism would be&#13;
conducted in an environmentally sustainable manner. This action would include&#13;
the preparation of a marketing study and development of tourism information&#13;
materials concerning Laane County with an emphasis on Haapsalu and Matsalu&#13;
Bays. Additional action should be taken under the proposed Project to evaluate&#13;
how to increase culture and health related tourism to Haapsalu and adjacent&#13;
areas. Emphasis would be placed on linking the major attractions of Laane&#13;
County to those of the Estonian Baltic islands which are only reached by land by&#13;
access routes from ferry terminals adjacent to either Haapsalu or Matsalu Bays.&#13;
This would be complemented by a marketing assessment for points of interest in&#13;
the region of Haapsalu and Matsalu Bays. On the basis of this assessment, is&#13;
proposed that visitor information be prepared for the Haapsalu and Matsalu Bays&#13;
region in Estonian, English, Finnish, German and Swedish to assist in the&#13;
development of the domestic and international tourist industry. This would&#13;
include information concerning the ecological, cultural, recreational and special&#13;
health related attractions of the Haapsalu and Matsalu Bays region. The estimated&#13;
cost for these activities is US $100,000.&#13;

(b)    Evaluation of Adaptive Reuse of Matsalu Manor. A study would be prepared to&#13;
evaluate the options and costs for the adaptive reuse of the historic Matsalu&#13;
Manor and associated outbuildings to support activities at the Reserve. The study&#13;
would examine a variety of multi-purpose reuse options including development&#13;
of a visitors center, training center, various types of accommodations, and&#13;
storage. The study would include an evaluation of investment costs, operation&#13;
and maintenance costs and assess potential means for raising the required&#13;
investment budget. The study would include an assessment of potential types and&#13;
numbers of visitors, their interests and potential expenditure patterns. Although&#13;
the adaptive reuse of the Matsalu Manor and other historic buildings within the&#13;
Matsalu State Nature Reserve should receive priority for the accommodation of&#13;
nature oriented tourists, it is assumed that outside the Reserve, facilities for&#13;
tourists would be undertaken by the private sector. The estimated cost for this&#13;
study is US $50,000.&#13;

D. Project Costs&#13;
8.           The total cost of the Haapsalu and Matsalu Bays Environment Project is estimated at&#13;
about US $8.37 million or EEK 106 million equivalent, including contingencies and value added tax&#13;
on the local expenses.&#13;
9.            The cost for the WWIC is estimated at about US $6.25 million or EEK 79 million&#13;
equivalent, including contingencies and value added tax on the local expenses. The total base cost is&#13;
estimated at US $4.40 million. Physical contingencies are estimated at US $0.40 million. Price&#13;
contingencies between the appraisal in January 1995 and estimated project completion in June 1999&#13;
would amount to approximately US $0.9 million or 18 percent of base cost plus physical&#13;
contingencies. Total contingencies represent 28 percent of the base cost. The foreign exchange&#13;
component is estimated at approximately US $3.6 million including contingencies, or about 58 percent&#13;
of the total cost of the WWIC.&#13;
10.          The cost for the EMC is estimated at about US $2.1 million or EEK 27 million&#13;
equivalent, including contingencies. The total base cost is estimated at US $1.60 million. Physical&#13;
contingencies are estimated at US $0.16 million. Price contingencies between appraisal conducted in&#13;
January 1995 and estimated project completion in June 1999 would amount to approximately&#13;
US $0.42 million or 24 percent of base cost plus physical contingencies.&#13;
11.          The estimated cost distribution among Project components is shown in Tables la and&#13;
lb below.&#13;
12.          Bases of Cost Estimates. Project costs were estimated as follows:&#13;
(a)    Base Costs. Cost estimates are based on: preliminary estimates prepared by the&#13;
consultants for the WWIC following review by the Bank. Cost estimates for the EMC&#13;
have been jointly developed by the MOE, Matsalu State Nature Reserve, WWF and&#13;
the Bank on the basis of previous experience with similar activities;&#13;
(b)    Contingency Allowances. Project costs include a contingency for unforeseen physical&#13;
variations (US $0.58 million) equivalent to 10 percent of the base. Price contingencies&#13;
on base costs and physical contingencies are estimated at about US $1.3 million,&#13;
equivalent to 19 percent of base costs and physical contingencies, and reflect Bank&#13;
estimates of local and international price increases'. In estimating the price&#13;
contingencies, it is assumed that any differentials between domestic and international&#13;
inflation rates would be offset by appropriate adjustments in exchange rates; and&#13;
(c)    Foreign Exchange Component. The foreign exchange component is estimated at about&#13;
US $4.48 million including contingencies, or 54 percent of total Project cost.&#13;
1     Foreign inflation rates: 3.3 % in 1995 and 2.5% thereafter; percent per year for the life of the Project. Local inflation&#13;
rates: 20% in FY95; 12 % in FY96; 8% in FY97; 6% percent in FY98; and 6% in FY99.&#13;

E. Financing Plan&#13;
13.         The proposed Bank Loan of US $2.0 million will finance about 24 percent of Project&#13;
costs. The Bank Loan will be repaid by the GOE over 15 years including 5 years of grace at the&#13;
Bank's standard variable rate of interest.&#13;
*     Water and Wastewater Improvement Component. Grant cofinancing corresponds to&#13;
approximately 38 percent of total component costs. Parallel cofinancing would be&#13;
provided by: (a) the Government of Finland, through the Ministry of Environment, in&#13;
the amount of FIM 3.8 million (US $0.8 million equivalent) to support investments in&#13;
the wastewater collection and treatment elements of the proposed Project; and (b) the&#13;
Government of Sweden, through the Board of Investment and Technical Support&#13;
(BITS), would provide up to SEK 12 million (US $1.6 million equivalent) to support&#13;
investments in the wastewater collection and treatment elements of the proposed&#13;
Project. The funding is being provided by Finland and Sweden in the context of their&#13;
support for the Baltic Sea Environment Program.&#13;
Local counterpart contribution of EEK 20 million or US $1.6 million equivalent would&#13;
be provided by the GOE; EEK 3.3 million or US $0.26 million equivalent would be&#13;
provided by the MOH.&#13;
*     Environmental Management Component. Parallel grant cofinancing by the Government&#13;
of Denmark (about US $600,000 equivalent), the Government of Sweden, through the&#13;
Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (US $330,000), the Government of&#13;
Finland, through the Ministry of Environment (US $220,000) and the European Union&#13;
(PHARE) (US $300,000) would be provided. This would be complemented by local&#13;
contributions of US $670,000. It is anticipated that the Danish funds would be&#13;
provided to Estonia through a grant to WWF-Denmark which would administer the&#13;
funds in cooperation with local counterparts consistent with an approved work plan.&#13;
Local counterpart contribution of US $670,000 equivalent would be provided by GOE.&#13;

II. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
A. Organizations Responsible for the Project and Interagency Coordination&#13;
15.          Ministry of Environment. An International Relations Department has been established&#13;
within the MOE which is responsible for the preparation and supervision of all internationally funded&#13;
projects. This unit, along with the Nature Protection Department and Water Protection Department, has&#13;
been directly involved in the preparation of the proposed Project, including the review and approval of&#13;
terms of reference, selection and supervision of consultants and review of their studies. Based on previous&#13;
Bank experience in working with the MOE in the context of the Baltic Sea Environment Program and on&#13;
Project preparation to date, it is anticipated that the staff of these departments would be capable of&#13;
successfully supporting supervision of the proposed Project.&#13;
16.          Haapsalu Water Works. The MOE has appointed HWW to undertake implementation of&#13;
the WWIC. This approach is fully consistent with the policy of the MOE to support the decentralization&#13;
of environmental management responsibilities to local municipalities and to have those parties which&#13;
would be responsible for operation and maintenance of facilities take an active role in their design and&#13;
construction.&#13;
17.          The HWW is now owned by the Haapsalu local government in accordance with the Law&#13;
on Local Government Arrangement (1993). The legal process of forming a municipal enterprise was&#13;
completed in February 1995. The HWW is managed by a director who has been appointed by the MOH.&#13;
In addition, a board, formed by members of the City Council, representatives from the private sector and&#13;
the community, will be formed as an advisory board for the utility. The utility will be financially&#13;
independent, having its own bank accounts. The authority of approving the budgets for operation and&#13;
maintenance and investments as well as tariffs charged by HWW have been delegated to MOH by the&#13;
City Council.&#13;
18.          Other Implementing Agencies. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), working&#13;
through its Baltic Regional Program and Danish Program, would participate in the implementation of the&#13;
protected areas management activities for the Matsalu State Nature Reserve and Matsalu Bay catchment&#13;
area management. Concerned local level environmental, infrastructure, planning and tourism organizations&#13;
have a limited number of skilled personnel; however, with proper design and supervision of the proposed&#13;
activities, they should be able to have a significant role in implementation and benefit from component&#13;
supported training activities.&#13;
B. Agreements between Borrower and Implementing Agencies&#13;
19.          The following agreements were reached between the Borrower and the Implementing&#13;
Agencies during negotiations:&#13;
(a)    The Borrower ensured that it would identify how its counterpart contributions would be&#13;
provided and specify the procedures to be used for on-lending to HWW;&#13;
(b)    The MOE would provide names of the members of the Project Steering Committee&#13;
(PSC);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX I&#13;
Page 22&#13;
(c)    The Municipality of Haapsalu and HWW would nominate personnel for carrying out the&#13;
WWIC, including the proposed appointment of key personnel for the Project&#13;
Implementation Unit (PIU);&#13;
(d)    The PIU for the WWIC should become operational in May 1995;&#13;
(e)    Detailed Implementation Plans would be provided for the WWIC and the EMC;&#13;
(f)    The Municipality of Haapsalu would agree to continue approving regular tariff increases&#13;
sufficient to allow the HWW to cover water production and treatment costs, wastewater&#13;
treatment and disposal costs, operation and maintenance, depreciation, interest and make&#13;
a contribution to reserves;&#13;
(g)    The HWW would commit itself to carry out the planned twinning arrangement with a&#13;
utility acceptable to the Bank; and&#13;
(h)    The MOE would provide the names of the Chairperson, Secretary and members of the&#13;
ATT.&#13;
C. Responsibilities of Implementing Agencies&#13;
20.          Project Coordination. The GOE's MOE would provide overall coordination and&#13;
supervision of the Project, coordinate actions of funding organizations and local implementing agencies,&#13;
and manage interactions with the Bank. The MOE has appointed a Project Coordinator in the International&#13;
Relations Department to perform this task. This department has national responsibility for coordination&#13;
and supervision of all internationally supported environmental projects, either loan or grant financed,&#13;
including those supported by international financial institutions, the EU and a series of bilateral&#13;
cooperation agreements with foreign governments. In order to facilitate day-to-day implementation of the&#13;
Project, consistent with Estonian decentralization policies, the MOE would delegate most implementation&#13;
responsibilities for the WWIC to the HWW. For the coordination and management of the EMC, MOE&#13;
would be assisted, as appropriate by the HELCOM PITF Working Group on Coastal Lagoons and&#13;
Wetlands Area Task Team (MLW/ATT) established in 1994 for the Matsalu Bay area to initiate and&#13;
coordinate at the local level the implementation of the coastal lagoons and wetlands component of the&#13;
JCP.&#13;
21.          Project Steering Committee. To facilitate implementation of the proposed Project, the&#13;
MOE would formally extend the charter of the current Project Steering Committee (PSC) for the project&#13;
preparation to cover project implementation as well. It is anticipated that current members would be&#13;
retained for the benefit of continuity. PSC membership would include representatives of MOE, MOH,&#13;
HWW, Lihula Water Works, Matsalu State Nature Reserve, and Laane, and Rapla Counties. Draft terms&#13;
of reference for the PSC were agreed upon during negotiations (Annex 3C).&#13;
22.          The PSC would provide overall guidance for the proposed Project and facilitate national&#13;
and local government coordination issues. It would ensure that financial resources required under the&#13;
Project are made available to the implementing agencies in a timely manner and monitor Project&#13;
expenditure and costs. The PSC would monitor the movement of official documents and contracts through&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX I&#13;
Page 23&#13;
the usual approval processes and undertake measures to expedite their release. It would also monitor&#13;
compliance with Bank Procurement Guidelines in the acquisition of equipment and technical assistance&#13;
contracts.&#13;
23.          Water and Wastewater Improvement Component. HWW  would be responsible for&#13;
implementation of the water and wastewater improvement component. The director of HWW would be&#13;
responsible for supervision of all Project supported activities concerning water and wastewater. To&#13;
facilitate implementation of this component a small Project Implementation Unit (PIU) would be&#13;
established within HWW. The PIU would be assisted, as required, by international consultants to support&#13;
the preparation of technical specifications, bidding documents, tendering, bid evaluation, contract awards,&#13;
supervision of civil works and equipment installation and follow-up activities. Annex 3D includes agreed&#13;
Terms of Reference for the PIU.&#13;
24.          Environmental Management Component. This component would be implemented by the&#13;
MOE, local authorities and WWF under the supervision of a MOE technical specialist. The coordination&#13;
and supervision of the various sub-components would be carried out by the MOE, with the assistance of&#13;
the MLW/ATT. The ATT consists of representatives from the MOE, Matsalu State Nature Reserve, the&#13;
Laane County, the Rapla County, Tallinn Technical University, Estonian Fund for Nature, and WWF.&#13;
A Secretary was appointed to the ATT by the MOE in November 1994. The implementation of this&#13;
component would be carried out in accordance with a work plan and terms of reference acceptable to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
25.          Implementation Completion Report. The PSC Chairperson, with the support of the HWW&#13;
and the MOE, would prepare a draft Implementation Completion Report (ICR) within six months after&#13;
completion of the Project.&#13;
26.          Chart 2 below shows the department responsible and implementing agency for each sub-&#13;
component of the Project.&#13;

D. Role of the World Bank during Supervision&#13;
27.            The proposed Project would be supervised by Bank staff in accordance with a proposed&#13;
supervision plan summarized in Chart 3. Representatives from MOE and the donors (BITS and the&#13;
Finnish Ministry of Environment) have informed the Bank that they would participate in supervision&#13;
missions. Staff from WWF are also expected to participate in selected missions.&#13;
28.            Supervision of the proposed Project would be particularly intense during the first two&#13;
years when considerable input would be required for: (a) engineering and procurement aspects of the&#13;
water and wastewater improvement component; and (b) preparation and initial implementation of activities&#13;
under the environmental management component.&#13;
29.            A mid-term  review would be conducted around April 1997 to evaluate overall Project&#13;
progress including progress towards the goal of achieving HWW's financial autonomy, and to assess the&#13;
development and implementation of an amended tariff structure (see terms of reference, Annex 3B).&#13;
During the mid-term review, adjustments would be made in the implementation schedule, if deemed&#13;
necessary, to improve HWW's management capacity, and review the long-term tariff rates based on the&#13;
findings of the tariff study.&#13;
30.            It is planned that about 18 staff-weeks of effort for the first two years and about 15 staff-&#13;
weeks thereafter would be required for supervision. Following the start-up mission, supervision&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX I&#13;
Page 25&#13;
requirements would include two supervision missions and an annual review; in later years one supervision&#13;
mission and an annual review would be conducted. The final supervision mission would be to prepare&#13;
the Implementation Completion Report. It is planned that these missions, in order to minimize costs,&#13;
would be coordinated with those required for the complementary Liepaja Environment Project in Latvia&#13;
and Klaipeda Environment Project in Lithuania.&#13;

III. IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES&#13;
A. Implementation Preparation&#13;
31.          Terms of reference have been prepared and would be discussed and finalized during&#13;
negotiations for a number of implementation preparation activities. Terms of reference for the twinning&#13;
arrangement, tariff study, PSC and PIU can be found in Annex 3.&#13;
B. Procurement Arrangements and Schedule&#13;
32.          Like many other Eastern European and FSU countries, Estonia does not have a tradition&#13;
of competitive bidding for the procurement of public goods and services. All procurement during the&#13;
Soviet period was done centrally. The GOE is now in the process of preparing legislation instituting&#13;
public procurement rules and regulations as part of its comprehensive program to transform its economy&#13;
from a centrally planned to a market-oriented system based on the development of a competitive private&#13;
sector. The GOE has requested the Bank to provide assistance in this area. A Country Procurement&#13;
Assessment Report (CPAR) is not required at this stage. Since the introduction of procurement legislation&#13;
is expected to take some time, assurance for this proposed Project would be obtained during negotiations&#13;
that the GOE would apply procurement procedures which are consistent with the Bank's "Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement Under IBRD and IDA Credits" (May 1992).&#13;
33.           Procurement for the WWIC, under parallel cofinancing arrangements (approximately&#13;
US $2.4 million) would be carried out through tied procurement in accordance with procurement&#13;
regulations of the governments of Finland and Sweden. Procurement would be undertaken in the&#13;
following manner:&#13;
(a)    All Bank funded contracts which are estimated to cost more than US $200,000 equivalent&#13;
per contract would be procured following International Competitive Bidding (ICB). The&#13;
Borrower would use the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for Supply and Erect&#13;
Contracts. Five contracts totalling approximately US $1.60 million for civil works and&#13;
larger equipment for water supply and sewerage systems would be awarded under ICB;&#13;
(b)    Procedures for International Shopping (IS) and Local Shopping (LS) would be used for&#13;
procurement of smaller contracts up to US $200,000 and US $50,000 respectively&#13;
because the cost of ICB would clearly outweigh possible price advantages. It is expected&#13;
that some small components such as sewerage system reconstruction and laboratory&#13;
equipment would be procured through IS. LS procedures would be used for procurement&#13;
of office equipment. Contracts awarded under IS procedures (totalling approximately US&#13;
$200,000) would be based on comparing price quotations obtained from at least three&#13;
suppliers from three eligible countries in accordance with Bank guidelines. Contracts&#13;
awarded under LS procedures (totalling approximately US $30,000) would be based on&#13;
comparing price quotations from at least three local suppliers; and&#13;
(c)    Consultant Services would be requested for consultant support for the PIU (US $0.45&#13;
million). Potential candidates would be short listed and selected on a competitive basis&#13;
according to Bank Guidelines, and hiring would be on terms and conditions acceptable&#13;
to the Bank.&#13;

34.          Relevant personnel from the MOE and the PIU would participate in procurement training&#13;
courses organized by the Bank before Loan effectiveness. A regional procurement training course,&#13;
provided by the Regional Procurement Advisor is been tentatively scheduled for May 1995 in Lithuania.&#13;
The efficiency and capability of the Borrower to carry out the Bank's procurement procedures would be&#13;
strengthened through ongoing training and the use of standard bidding documents. Provision of&#13;
international technical assistance for the PIU, financed under the proposed Loan should ensure adequate&#13;
administration of procurement.&#13;
35.          Procurement Review. All ICB procurement packages would be subject to the Bank's prior&#13;
review and approval, in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 4 of Appendix 1 of the Bank's Procurement&#13;
Guidelines. All prior review items would cover 80 percent of the total amount of the Loan. Other loan-&#13;
funded activities would be subject to the Bank's post review during the supervision of the Project, in&#13;
accordance with paragraphs 3 and 4 of Appendix 1 of the Guidelines.&#13;
36.          A draft summary of procurement packages for works, equipment, and technical assistance,&#13;
indicating the schedule for tendering and the estimated cost is shown in Tables 4, 5 and 8. Completion&#13;
time of contracts would be determined during appraisal.&#13;
37.          Procurement Monitoring. Procurement data would be collected and recorded by the PIU&#13;
for: (i) prompt reporting of contract award information by the Borrower; (ii) comprehensive quarterly&#13;
reports to the Bank by the Borrower; and (iii) revised timing of procurement actions, including&#13;
advertising, bidding, contract award, and completion time for individual contracts.&#13;

C. Disbursements&#13;
38.          The proposed Loan is expected to be disbursed over a period of four fiscal years (1996-&#13;
1999) on the following basis:&#13;
39.          The proceeds of the Bank Loan would be disbursed against:&#13;
(a)    For goods: 100 percent of foreign expenditures, 100 percent of local ex-factory&#13;
expenditures and 80 percent of local expenditures for other items procured locally;&#13;
(b)    For works: 100 percent of foreign expenditures and 80 percent of local expenditures; and&#13;
(c)    For consultancy services and training: 100 percent of expenditures&#13;
All cofinancers would manage their own disbursements.&#13;
40.          The allocation of the Bank Loan proceeds and the corresponding local contribution grant&#13;
proceeds are shown in Table 6; Table 7 indicates forecasts of expenditures and disbursements for the&#13;
proposed Project.&#13;
41.          Disbursement requests would be prepared and submitted to the Bank by PIU.&#13;
42.          Disbursement would be made against standard Bank documentation. The documentation&#13;
to support these expenditures would be retained by the PIU for review by Bank supervision missions and&#13;
verification by external audits. Disbursement requests would be fully documented except for expenditures&#13;
under contracts for goods and equipment valued at less than US $200,000 equivalent, where statements&#13;
of expenditure (SOE) would be used. Applications for direct payment and special commitment may be&#13;
submitted provided they are for amounts equivalent to at least US $50,000. The Bank would not honor&#13;
direct payment requests below US $50,000.&#13;
43.          To facilitate Project implementation, the Borrower would establish a Special Account in&#13;
one of the major foreign commercial banks on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank to cover the&#13;
Bank's share of eligible expenditures. The authorized allocation would be US $200,000, representing&#13;
about four months of average expenditures. At the request of the Borrower, and based on Project needs,&#13;
the Bank would make an initial deposit or deposits into the special account up to the amount of the&#13;
authorized allocation. Applications for replenishment of the special account would be submitted monthly&#13;
or when one-third of the amount has been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier. Documentation&#13;
requirements for replenishment would follow the standard procedure. In addition, monthly bank&#13;
statements of the special account which have been reconciled by the Borrower would accompany all&#13;
replenishment requests.&#13;
44.          Training in disbursement was provided to key Estonian personnel responsible for Project&#13;
implementation, in Riga, Latvia, in January 1995.&#13;

45.           Overview. HWW was established as a municipally owned water and wastewater enterprise&#13;
in February, 1995 as a part of GOE's broad strategy to decentralize muncipal services. In order to&#13;
become a financially autonomous municipal enterprise, HWW needs to improve its technology and&#13;
financial management through undertaking complementary investment and institutional strengthening&#13;
activities.&#13;
46.           Central to its approach of institutional strengthening is development of a formal "twinning&#13;
arrangement" on a contractual basis with an experienced water and wastewater utility under terms of&#13;
reference acceptable to the Bank. This twinning arrangement, funded under the Project, would provide&#13;
support for: utility management; monitoring and use of laboratory data; system investment planning;&#13;
rehabilitation program design; construction supervision; operation and maintenance; tariff setting; billing&#13;
and collection; accounting and auditing; human resources development and public information programs&#13;
(see Annex 3A for the draft terms of reference). The Bank supports alternatives approaches as long as&#13;
the institutional objectives of the Project are achievable.&#13;
47.           Past Performance. Analysis of HWW's financial statements for the years 1991-1993&#13;
shows that the tariff levels were so low in 1991 that the state intervened with subvention of operating&#13;
expenses; in 1992, tariff levels were increased to a level sufficient enough to cover its cash operating&#13;
costs and to a small extent a provision for planned maintenance. In 1993, tariffs were increased but not&#13;
to a level sufficient enough to cover inflation; the utility consequently experienced a deficit. Had the&#13;
accounts properly accounted for charges for other non-cash items, including a provision for bad and&#13;
doubtful debts, and proper asset depreciation reflecting replacement costs revaluation, deficits would have&#13;
been reported for the whole 1991-1993 period. Preliminary 1994 numbers show HWW made minimal&#13;
profits, though again with an undervalued depreciation. HWW's financial performance for the 1991-1993&#13;
period is summarized in Table 9.&#13;
48.           Historically, GOE has provided financing for all of HWW's capital investment program.&#13;
Consequently, the enterprise has no long term external debt. Most of the short term debt, reflected largely&#13;
in accounts payable, is money owed for electricity supply, natural resource taxes, and pollution taxes.&#13;
Toward the end of 1993 and in early 1994, the financial viability of HWW was hampered by the the&#13;
transfer of state residential, commercial and industrial properties to the private sector, which has&#13;
neglected outstanding liabilities of previous owners who failed to pay their bills. Additionally, industries&#13;
in Haapsalu have experienced financial downturns and consequently regard payment of water bills to be&#13;
low priority.&#13;
49.           HWW's inability during the past three years to adjust tariffs in a timely manner to&#13;
compensate for inflation, to make proper provisions for future investment and maintenance needs, and&#13;
to compensate for increasing non-payment by consumers has deprived the utility of cash to run its day-to-&#13;
day operations, let alone provide for future investments.&#13;
50.    The budget is prepared on the assumption of 100% revenue collection on a current basis. On the&#13;
basis of budgets thus constructed, the City Council determines the tariff rates and tax liability.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX I&#13;
Page 36&#13;
51.           Tariff Levels and Revenues. Water tariffs are currently inadequate to cover full operating&#13;
and depreciation costs. Despite several tariff increases in the last few years, increases have not, since&#13;
1992, kept pace with the high and erratic periods of inflation and thus have failed to adjust properly to&#13;
real cost increases. In September 1994, the City Council agreed to a combined tariff increase for water&#13;
to 2.10 kr/m3 and wastewater to 4.40 kr/m3, which still does not cover full operating and depreciation&#13;
costs. The tariff structure does not include standing charges (only a symbolic connection fee is said to&#13;
be charged) nor incremental charges for higher levels of consumption. All tariffs are either of a simple&#13;
volumetric form or, as is the case for industrial discharges, of a weighted volumetric form. Industrial&#13;
customers are metered, as are approximately 95 percent of domestic customers. Wastewater tariffs are&#13;
generally applied on the basis of consumed (metered or estimated) water, rather than accurate sewerage&#13;
metering. The only exceptions are those for large industrial customers which use considerable volumes&#13;
of water in the production process, for which a revised "return rate" is agreed, or for those who possess&#13;
their own water supply, in which case the private supply is metered and a "reduced" charge calculated.&#13;
In the institutional strengthening component, consisting of the twinning arrangement, assistance for tariff&#13;
planning and financial operations would be provided based on the results of the tariff study (see TOR,&#13;
Annex 3B).&#13;
52.          Billing and Collection. HWW's billing and collection procedures are only partly&#13;
computerized; consumers are divided into: (a) residential customers; and (b) industrial consumers&#13;
(including schools, hospitals, offices and shops). At present, residential and industrial customers pay the&#13;
same tariff. HWW formerly differentiated between households and industry for wastewater fees. Since&#13;
1994, however, the base fee is the same for both kinds of users.&#13;
53.           The collection process is administratively burdensome but has so far been adequate given&#13;
that the debt ratio does not exceed 10 percent of average total revenues. This only corresponds to about&#13;
a month's payment. The amount of average yearly debts have increased at the same rate as Estonia's&#13;
internal inflation. Good collection history has been encouraged by HWW's policy of turning off the water&#13;
from non-paying consumers. At the end of 1993, however, industrial consumer debt had increased,&#13;
attributed largely to bankruptcy amongst companies, while the households fulfilled their payment&#13;
obligations relatively better.&#13;
54.          Accounting System. HWW has overhauled its former command accounting system to an&#13;
internationally recognized accrual accounting system. However, there remain a number of accounting&#13;
procedural deficiencies, including fixed asset revaluation procedures, proper general ledger preparations,&#13;
and other account transactions. Additionally, the computerized system requires upgrading. The required&#13;
support to improve the financial management of HWW would be provided under the twinning&#13;
arrangement. To facilitate improved control of HWW's finances, the Project proposes to support the&#13;
implementation of an automated accounting system linked to various Management Information System&#13;
(MIS).&#13;
55.          Accounts Receivable. HWW's accounts receivable as a percentage of gross revenue&#13;
improved significantly from 1993 to 1994, decreasing from 13.8 percent to 7.4 percent respectively,&#13;
However, HWW does not maintain comprehensive information on accounts receivable. Under the Action&#13;
Plan, HWW would: (a) produce a comprehensive statement of accounts receivable by consumer category&#13;
and age; (b) implement a program for the effective recovery of outstanding accounts; and (c) include a&#13;
provision in the income statement for non-performing receivables.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX I&#13;
Page 37&#13;
56.           Debt. The proposed financing plan for HWW  would yield a debt-equity ratio which&#13;
averages approximately 30 percent during the Project lifetime and never exceeds 50 percent.&#13;
Consequently, HWW would not be in an over-leveraged position during the life of the Project. To insure&#13;
financial stability the utility should not incure any debt during the Project implementation period, unless&#13;
its net cash generated2 is at least 1.5 times the total estimated debt service requirements.&#13;
57.           Asset Revaluations. HWW's historical statements are not readily comparable with present&#13;
financial performance, and despite a major asset revaluation in December 1992 and tariff increases,&#13;
proper charges for depreciation are not made against revenue. This emphasizes the need, particularly in&#13;
periods of high or erratic inflation, for regular adjustments to tariff and asset values to ensure proper&#13;
funding for asset replacement. Additionally, it is desirable that a more comprehensive asset revaluation&#13;
be carried out to provide an acceptable estimate of HWW's assets, based on current replacement costs&#13;
and their physical condition. Given that a proper asset revaluation is an expensive exercise and likely to&#13;
take time HWW could revalue its assets based on a limited physical inventory used to assess replacement&#13;
value. The entire inventory would consequently be adjusted accordingly. This revaluation exercise is&#13;
included in the terms of reference for the tariff study.&#13;
58.            Future Financial Performnance. The projections show  that the water and sewerage&#13;
operations will be financially sustaining, provided: (a) the revenue projections are fulfilled; (b) water and&#13;
sewerage tariffs are periodically adjusted to maintain the objective of full debt service cost recovery; (c)&#13;
accounts receivable are sustained (payments outstanding are at an acceptable level of under 1 month); (d)&#13;
adequate levels of sustained maintenance are provided; and (e) the reorganization, training, and technical&#13;
assistance proposals are implemented to promote operating efficiency and cost reductions. The projections&#13;
show that with the prescribed tariff adjustments presented above, the utility would generate sufficient&#13;
funds to cover the debt service obligations (it exceeds 1.5 from year 1994 through 2005). Financial&#13;
projections for the water supply and sewerage system are presented in Appendix 1.&#13;
59.            Projections of HWW's financial performance assume that its future, outstanding long term&#13;
debt obligation is only that owed to the Bank in an amount totalling US$ 2.0 million. This requires tariff&#13;
adjustments over the 1995-1999 period, as presented in Table 9 below, that are structured to allow the&#13;
utility to achieve a cash flow level adequate enough to:&#13;
-      service debt obligations at a cash flow generation level which does not allow the&#13;
debt service coverage ratio to fall below 1.5 each year;&#13;
-      achieve a working ratio3 of 50 percent or below;&#13;
-      achieve an operating ratio4 below 85 percent; and&#13;
-      achieve a return on assets5 of at least 10 percent.&#13;
2      Net cash generated equals net cash flow minus Bank debt service.&#13;
3      Working ratio = operating expenses divided by revenue.&#13;
4      Operating ratio = operating costs, depreciation, and interest expense divided by revenue&#13;
5      Return on assets = (net income plus interest) x (1-tax rate)/Replacement Value of Assets.&#13;

60.           The tariff increases proposed below would allow HWW to meet the financial objectives&#13;
listed above as early as 1995, achieving the financial objectives as presented in Appendix 1 of this Annex.&#13;
61.           Tariff Affordability. Current combined tariffs correspond to EEK 6.50/m3 for both&#13;
domestic and industrial customers, which represents approximately 2.6 percent of the monthly average&#13;
household income. Given the estimated real tariff increase of approximately 95 percent over a period of&#13;
five years and a real income growth, the water service tariffs are estimated to correspond to an average&#13;
of approximately 3.7 percent of the average household income. In general, water and wastewater tariffs&#13;
consisting of 3-4 percent of average household income are considered acceptable. It should be noted that&#13;
households in Estonia often have undeclared income that is not reflected in the income level used in this&#13;
affordability calculation. Affordability and the possibility of extending the social safety net to the lowest&#13;
income categories were reviewed and discussed in detail with MOH during appraisal. Assumptions&#13;
underlying the affordability estimates are presented in Annex 6.&#13;
62.           Financial viability. HWW's financial sustainability would be achieved by implementation&#13;
of a tariff level that would allow it to generate a cash flow sufficient enough to meet the financial&#13;
objectives outlined in para. 60. These would collectively ensure HWW's ability to service debt&#13;
obligations, provide proper provisions for depreciation of revalued assets, and bad and doubtful debts,&#13;
and generate sufficient net profits to yield a 10 percent or higher return on assets.&#13;
63.           Additional Project benefits are externalities which cannot easily be quantified nor&#13;
incorporated into HWW's finance rate of return analysis. These include direct environmental benefits and&#13;
indirect financial benefits to the regional economy from improved environment quality, management of&#13;
important ecosystems and increased tourism.&#13;

E. Project Risks&#13;
64.           Slippage. With regard to the WWUC, there is a limited risk that Project implementation&#13;
would encounter delays due to limited experience in the use of international procurement procedures. In&#13;
addition, given the limited technical experience with actual costs for implementation of water and&#13;
wastewater improvements in post-Soviet Estonia, the volatility of local price changes, and previous lack&#13;
of construction activities to international standards in this sector, construction costs may be&#13;
underestimated. In order to minimize these risks, the Project would provide for the establishment of a&#13;
strong PIU, adoption of conservative approaches to cost estimation combined with appropriate physical&#13;
and price contingencies, and provision of significant technical and procurement support from Bank staff&#13;
during supervision both from headquarters and the regional office.&#13;
65.           On the basis of previous Bank experience in Eastern Europe there is also a risk that the&#13;
GOE and cooperating local governments may have problems with the timely provision of local currency&#13;
support and availability of adequately qualified personnel for Project management, the latter due to&#13;
government limits on salaries paid to civil servants. These risks would be reduced through close&#13;
supervision and quick actions to address these types of implementation problems should they occur.&#13;
66.          Institutional and Financial. On the institutional and financial side, the main risks would&#13;
be the commitment of the Haapsalu City Council to allow the HWW to function as an independent utility&#13;
which, interalia, may interfere with HWW's ability to adjust tariffs sufficiently to cover its costs,&#13;
including the repayment of the Bank Loan. These risks can only be partially mitigated through Project&#13;
supervision, as MOH is an independent body subject to political and social pressures. MOH can be made&#13;
aware of the consequence of its decisions on tariffs through the dialogue afforded by supervision, the&#13;
tariff study, and the requested presentation of annual HWW budgets. That MOH jointly with HWW signs&#13;
the GOE's subsidiary loan agreement will serve to lower the risk of significant deviations from a rational&#13;
tariff policy.&#13;
67.           Technology and Management. The WWIC technology is standard and involves no unusual&#13;
risks. The main risk is the utility's financial and institutional capability, requiring substantial&#13;
strengthening of its financial and managerial capability. Experience with other municipal water and&#13;
wastewater authorities in transitional economies demonstrates that close Project supervision and adequate&#13;
technical assistance mitigate these risks. The proposed technologies to be demonstrated under the EMC&#13;
for the control of point and non-point source pollution from small settlements and agriculture are simple,&#13;
and have been tested under similar conditions in the Nordic countries and North America. The use of&#13;
ecological engineering methods would allow for the adaptation of a variety of low-cost methods, including&#13;
constructed wetlands, under Estonian conditions. A number of Estonian environmental specialists,&#13;
associated with both applied research and consulting firms, have knowledge of these technologies and&#13;
some demonstration work has already been undertaken by specialists from Tartu University.&#13;
68.           The principal risks for the EMC concern: (a) difficulties in coordination of activities&#13;
between various national, local, non-governmental, and consultant organizations; (b) resistance from local&#13;
authorities and residents to proposed land use control measures to be included in the catchment area and&#13;
Matsalu State Nature Reserve management plans; (c) a reluctance of local authorities and agriculturalists&#13;
to adopt new low-cost technologies for the control of pollution; and (d) unanticipated problems associated&#13;
with the complex issues of restitution of lands confiscated by the State during the Soviet period to their&#13;
pre-1940 owners.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 40&#13;
69.          Coordination issues are expected to be addressed effectively by the establishment of&#13;
smaller implementation teams each acting with the support of the Project Coordinator and the ATT&#13;
Secretary, complemented by close Bank supervision. Resistance to implementation due to land use&#13;
constraints and conflicts with pre-1940 land owners can only be addressed by having the direct&#13;
participation of these parties, as proposed in the planning and implementation of these activities. It should&#13;
be noted that the demonstration activities by their very nature are intended to test the application of these&#13;
approaches in the Estonian context and to provide lessons which can be transferred elsewhere within the&#13;
country and the Baltic Sea region.&#13;
F. Loan Covenants for Implementation&#13;
70.          Section VI. of the Staff Appraisal Report shows a complete list of Loan covenants to be&#13;
monitored during the Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
IV. MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
A. Actions to Monitor Development Objectives&#13;
71.          Given the essential role program monitoring and evaluation play in determining the impact&#13;
of a given intervention on development objectives, a number of indicators will be used to monitor and&#13;
evaluate progress during the implementation of the Haapsalu and Matsalu Bays Environment Project.&#13;
B. Project Indicators&#13;
72.          Project monitoring indicators were developed during appraisal in order to enable tracking&#13;
of Project inputs on key development objectives throughout the Project cycle. These indicators would be&#13;
developed further during negotiations. At the mid-term review, the need to fine-tune or restructure the&#13;
Project design will be based on the data received from these indicators. However, the progress of these&#13;
indicators would be evaluated in relative, not absolute, terms. During supervision, a selected number of&#13;
commercial, operational, financial and environmental indicators would be monitored in accordance with&#13;
Project objectives. An illustrative list of indicators follows for each component:&#13;
Water and Wastewater Improvement Component&#13;
(a)    Commercial indicators&#13;
Service area is expected to increase with new connections to both water supply&#13;
and sewerage. The change in number of water subscribers and connections would&#13;
be estimated; and&#13;
The collection ratio (total collections divided by total billings) is expected to&#13;
improve.&#13;
(b)    Operational indicators&#13;
--    The non-revenue water percentage (volume of water produced minus volume of&#13;
water sold, divided by volume of water produced) is expected to be reduced.&#13;
(c)    Financial indicators&#13;
The average unit price adjustments for water and sewerage supplied for each&#13;
consumer category (the tariff schedule) would be monitored in accordance with&#13;
the Loan and Project Agreements; and&#13;
The following standard financial indicators, in addition to the internal rate of&#13;
return, would be monitored:&#13;
Service debt obligations at a cash flow generation level which does not&#13;
allow the debt service coverage ratio to fall below 1.5 each year;&#13;
A working ratio at 50 percent or below;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

HAAPSALU AND MATSALU BAYS ENVIRONMENT PROJECT&#13;
ACTION PLAN&#13;
Haapsalu Water Works&#13;
A.     Introduction&#13;
1.     The management of Haapsalu Water Works (HWW) has decided to initiate the preparation and&#13;
implementation of an Action Plan to improve HWW's operational, commercial, and financial&#13;
performance, to the enterprise to:&#13;
(a)    improve the quality of its services;&#13;
(b)    internally generate funds to finance its operations, maintenance and infrastructure&#13;
improvements; and&#13;
(c)    service the repayment of the loan from the World Bank.&#13;
2.     A number of actions are needed to enable HWW to achieve its objectives are specified in this&#13;
Action Plan. Issues and needs of specific importance that require special attention have been&#13;
identified, and these include: (a) a long-term enterprise strategy; (b) tariff level and structure; (c)&#13;
need of operational management assistance; (d) service quality; (e) revenue collection; (f) recording&#13;
and budgetary processes; (g) accounting systems and principles; (h) HWW's functional structure;&#13;
and (i) revision of position descriptions, including that of the director.&#13;
B.     Actions to be Taken&#13;
3.     The HWW would undertake the following activities under the Action Plan:&#13;
(a)    Enterprise Strategy. A long term enterprise strategy would be prepared, including&#13;
projected future capital investment programs and policies for elimination of defects,&#13;
quality improvement, tariffs, revenue collection and organizational improvements. This&#13;
would include the preparation of a management program that would identify tasks,&#13;
allocate resources and staff responsibilities and set quantified performance targets. A draft&#13;
strategy would be completed by June 30, 1996.&#13;
(b)    Contracting of Management Assistance. This Action Plan would be implemented with&#13;
the help of a twinning arrangement with ...........................   Terms of reference for&#13;
the twinning arrangement have been developed in coordination with the World Bank. The&#13;
contract would be formalized by October 31, 1996.&#13;
(c)    Performance Standards. Developing a set of quality standards for each service. It is&#13;
understood that it is neither financially nor technically feasible to immediately adopt&#13;
corresponding European Union environmental standards but it is expected that a program&#13;
of target dates for phased implementation of these standards should form part of HWW's&#13;
strategy. This set of phased quality standards goals would be developed by June 30, 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 2&#13;
For this particular project, the Project Monitoring Indicators in the Project Implementation&#13;
Plan (PIP) would be utilized in accordance with the World Bank Project Agreement.&#13;
(d)    Bill Collection. Improving revenue collection by taking control of collection systems,&#13;
pressuring defaulters, obtaining additional authority for debt recovery through the court&#13;
system and providing incentives to customers who pay promptly. A plan would be&#13;
developed by January 1, 1996.&#13;
(e)    Budgetary and Account Systems. Improve all recording and budgetary processes and&#13;
systems of accounting. This would include staff and work plans and budget centers and&#13;
monthly reviews. New computerized systems would be introduced in conjunction with&#13;
extensive training to relevant staff. The new systems should be in place on or before June&#13;
30, 1997.&#13;
(f)    New Tariff Schedule. Preparation of a new tariff schedule, based on a detailed tariff&#13;
study by an international consultant, and implementation of the recommendations of the&#13;
study. The tariff schedule would be expected to be constructed to: (i) recover HWW's&#13;
capital and operational and maintenance costs; (ii) encourage customers to conserve water;&#13;
and (iii) be affordable.  The tariff structure should be optimized in terms of user&#13;
categories, tariff incrementality and standing charges. The study would determine the&#13;
minimum tariff adjustments required to repay the World Bank. The tariff study would be&#13;
completed on or before March 31, 1996. In the meantime, tariff would be adjusted&#13;
according to the Project Agreement.&#13;
(g)    HWW's Organization and Staff Structure. The functional structure of HWW would&#13;
be revised to take account of new and/or modified functions and to improve the pattern&#13;
of managerial control. A manpower plan would be prepared to clarify responsibilities,&#13;
define skill requirements and initiate staff development and recruitment systems. This&#13;
would be completed by October 1, 1995.&#13;
(h)    Position Descriptions.  The position descriptions for HWW, including that of the&#13;
Director, should be revised to more accurately reflect current and planned functions and&#13;
duties of the posts. The revision would be completed by October 1, 1995.&#13;
C.     Environmental Monitorine&#13;
4.     Environmental Monitoring.  HWW  would establish, in coordination with the Ministry of&#13;
Environment, an environmental monitoring program for BOD, N,P,, e-coli, and heavy metal in sludge to&#13;
evaluate the performance of the collection system, treatment processes and status of receiving waters, and&#13;
with the Ministry of Health for bathing waters. A draft proposal would be completed by June 15, 1995.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA&#13;
HAAPSALU AND MATSALU BAYS ENVIRONMENT PROJECT&#13;
Water and Wastewater Component&#13;
Terms of Reference for "Twinninsg Arrangement"&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The Baltic coast of Estonia is characterized by an intricate coastline dominated by Haapsalu and&#13;
Matsalu Bays, which are fringed by the islands of Vormsi, Hiiumaa and Saaremaa; together these form&#13;
a tourist and recreational destination of national, regional and historical importance. The attractions of&#13;
the area also include special sanitoria that feature treatments with unique curative muds found in Haapsalu&#13;
Bay and ecotourism in the Matsalu State Nature Reserve.&#13;
2.    At present, the sustainable use of the existing water resources is threatened by adverse effects&#13;
resulting from the discharge of under-treated municipal and industrial wastewater. The City of Haapsalu&#13;
is now discussing with the World Bank and the Governments of Finland and Sweden potential funding&#13;
of investments for technical, financial and institutional improvements of its water and wastewater services.&#13;
These discussions are based on detailed technical, financial and institutional studies assessing the situation&#13;
of Haapsalu Water Works (HWW) and providing the company with recommendations of potential&#13;
improvements. These studies have been prepared by SWECO consultants (Sweden), in association with&#13;
Eesti Projekt (Estonia) and Bohlin &amp; Stromberg (Sweden), financed by tne Government of Sweden; they&#13;
were completed in August 1994.&#13;
3.    When planning the implementation of possible improvements in water and wastewater services&#13;
in Haapsalu, it is important to bear in mind, that water and sewerage services in the country have only&#13;
recently been decentralized from state responsibility to the responsibility of the appropriate municipalities.&#13;
Therefore, water and sewerage facilities are not yet autonomous in accordance with market-oriented&#13;
management practices but are still centrally managed and function as direct extensions of municipal&#13;
governments. One of the principal obstacles in promoting the creation of autonomous enterprises which&#13;
could provide cost-effective, affordable municipal services, is the municipalities' lack of experience in&#13;
market-oriented operational and financial management practices. Consequently, in order to facilitate the&#13;
development of the utility into an autonomous, service-oriented and efficiently run enterprise with modern&#13;
management practices, external support is required. As a part of the proposed Haapsalu and Matsalu Bays&#13;
Environment Project, it is recommended that an organized Twinning Arrangement between HWW and&#13;
a reputable foreign water supply and sewerage company be formed in order to achieve the overall project&#13;
objectives. This document sets out the terms of reference for such an arrangement.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
4.    The main objective of this Twinning Arrangement would be to improve HWW's overall&#13;
performance through changes in it's operational and financial management practices. These changes would&#13;
be in accordance with an Action Plan, which would be developed by HWW and agreed by the Bank. The&#13;
overall objective of the Action Plan would be to define and formulate a strategic vision of the short- and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3A&#13;
Page 2&#13;
long-term future of the company in terms of its operations, legal identity, organizational setup and&#13;
financial condition. A particularly important objective for this task would be to provide HWW with a&#13;
commercial attitude and a sense of service directed at providing the best water supply possible to its&#13;
customers at an affordable cost without further municipal or government subsidies in the future.&#13;
Scope of Work&#13;
5.    The twinning partner, in close coordination with the Project Implementation Unit (PIU), would&#13;
support and assist HWW to implement the Action Plan, specifically with regard to institutional&#13;
strengthening and human resources development. This coordination would take place during the first three&#13;
years of the proposed project implementation period. Following this term, the "new" HWW would be&#13;
expected to operate in accordance with modern utility management practices and be fully equipped with&#13;
computerized management information systems. The twinning partner would bring to HWW, state-of-the-&#13;
art know-how in utility management, administration and operation.&#13;
Working Arrangements&#13;
6.    All activities and tasks under this arrangement are intended to be carried out in close coordination&#13;
of both parties. Counterpart systems would be applied whenever appropriate and the participation of a&#13;
maximum number of HWW staff would be emphasized. The twinning partner would: provide advisors&#13;
recruited from its own staff and/or outside the utility; provide minor equipment; and subcontract&#13;
consultants as and when necessary. The selection of consultants would be done jointly with HWW.&#13;
Cooperation under this Twinning Arrangement would be regarded as a binding agreement between the&#13;
two parties. A contract specifying duties, responsibilities, and fees and expenses, would be established&#13;
and agreed between the HWW and the twinning partner. Both parties would nominate a twinning&#13;
coordinator to be jointly responsible for the execution of the agreement. This contract and its execution&#13;
would be supervised by the PIU and World Bank supervision missions. Cooperation would be initiated&#13;
by drafting and agreeing upon a specified work plan which would include a detailed time schedule and&#13;
budget. The work plan, time schedule and budget would be cleared by the PIU and submitted to the&#13;
Project Steering Committee and the Bank.&#13;
Reporting&#13;
7.    The Twinning Arrangement would follow the same reporting requirements as the PIU. The&#13;
twinning coordinators would be jointly responsible for preparing annual financial reports and annual&#13;
progress reports for each activity included under the twinning agreement. These reports would be cleared&#13;
by the PIU and submitted to the Project Steering Committee and the Bank.&#13;
Main Tasks&#13;
8.    The main task of the twinning partner is to further refine and improve HWW's Action&#13;
Plan/Business Plan in order to create a long-termn strategic vision of the future of the company. The&#13;
operational experience and knowledge of the twinning partner, including administrative, organizational&#13;
and financial competencies would be transferred to HWW through support in the following three main&#13;
areas: (a) formulation and implementation of all management and administration procedures and systems;&#13;
(b) formulation and implementation of a program for system rehabilitation and operational improvements;&#13;
and (c) formulation and implementation of a training program:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3A&#13;
Page 3&#13;
(a)    Management and Administrative Procedures and Systems&#13;
(i)    Objective: The main objective of this component would be to improve existing,&#13;
and implement new management and information/administrative procedures and&#13;
systems within HWW to assist with the transformation of the company into an&#13;
efficiently run entity. An important objective would be to provide HWW with a&#13;
commercial attitude and a sense of service aimed toward providing the best water&#13;
supply possible to its customers. The tasks within this component would provide&#13;
the means to achieve those objectives.&#13;
(ii)   Scope: Support would be provided for the:&#13;
-      preparation of an organization and human resources development plan,&#13;
including definition of tasks and job descriptions, assessment of work&#13;
performance and conformity with the tasks;&#13;
-      identification of an appropriate computerization strategy, considering&#13;
budgetary constraints, computer systems expertise available in Estonia&#13;
and training needs. The strategy would include hardware and software&#13;
specifications, modular growth and compatibility, software development&#13;
standards, programming and interface languages, network requirements,&#13;
remote access, database integrity, etc.;&#13;
-      development  and  improvement  all  of  HWW's  managerial,&#13;
administrative, information and operating functions. This would include&#13;
reporting formats for internal and external parties and design or&#13;
adaptation of existing modern and appropriate computerized applications&#13;
for the following functions:&#13;
-      financial management (accounting, budgeting, financial planning, etc.);&#13;
-      custom-oriented commercial management (meter reading, customer&#13;
master file, billing, collection, customer services, consumer census,&#13;
consumer education programs, etc.);&#13;
-      supply management (requirements planning, purchasing, inventory&#13;
control etc.);&#13;
-      administration (budget controls, payroll, performance, etc.)&#13;
-      personnel management (recruiting, promotion, remuneration etc.);&#13;
-      operations and maintenance management (production control, work-&#13;
orders generation and control, collection of water and wastewater data,&#13;
etc.);&#13;
development of a Management Information System (MIS), which will&#13;
allow timely access to all information required for effective control and&#13;
management of the company. The computerization of the managerial,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3A&#13;
Page 4&#13;
administrative and operating functions would be developed in an&#13;
integrated manner. Any databases would require the storage of&#13;
information in a common format for future retrieval and analysis; and&#13;
-      development of a reporting system for the follow-up of capital investment&#13;
with the objective of providing the company's management with&#13;
appropriate tools for: making effective and efficient use of existing&#13;
assets; monitoring and controlling its investment programs; and&#13;
accounting for the impact of future renewals. It is proposed that the&#13;
implementation of a Geographic Information System (GIS) be considered.&#13;
(iii)   Training: It is expected that drafting new managerial and administrative functions&#13;
would be done jointly with the twinning partner and HWW. Most of the&#13;
knowledge transfer from the twinning partner to HWW would take place through&#13;
visits to the twinning company and on-the-job training during the process of&#13;
carrying out the different tasks under the component. However, specialized&#13;
training through external consultants or attendance in external training courses&#13;
for utilizing computers and associated software would be required as an initial&#13;
step of implementation.&#13;
(b)    System Rehabilitation Program, and Operational Improvements&#13;
(i)    Obiective: The main objective of this component would be to technically improve&#13;
operations and maintenance practices in the water and wastewater system&#13;
including the plant and distribution systems;&#13;
(ii)   Scope: Operation and maintenance water loss reduction, equipment maintenance,&#13;
etc. and the design or adaptation of existing modern and appropriate&#13;
computerized applications:&#13;
-      system repair and improvements;&#13;
-      formulation of a network optimization program;&#13;
-      supporting the implementation of a leak detection and repair program,&#13;
which includes the establishment of a reliable record of system leaks,&#13;
their causes and appropriate repair methods;&#13;
-      system mapping; and&#13;
-     demand management, including development and implementation of a&#13;
water loss reduction program.&#13;
(iii)   Training: Most of the knowledge transfer from the twinning partner would take&#13;
place through on-the-job training during the process of carrying out the different&#13;
tasks under the component. Specialized training through external consultants or&#13;
attendance in external training courses and visits to the twinning company would&#13;
be applied as appropriate. Training should be provided to HWW staff on the use&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3A&#13;
Page 5&#13;
of leakage detection equipment as well as on establishing leakage detection&#13;
routines.&#13;
(c) Training&#13;
(i)    Objective: The objective of the training component is to provide HWW staff with&#13;
the skills and knowledge required to enable the company to improve its&#13;
operational, commercial, and financial performance.&#13;
(ii)   Scope of the Training component: A rapid assessment of training needs within&#13;
HWW would be made. The training component would be based on the Action&#13;
Plan and draw upon the twinning partner's knowledge and experience. An&#13;
adequate composition of study tours, external course attendance, classroom and&#13;
on-the-job training would be designed. Training of trainers within HWW would&#13;
be emphasized and the provision of this required training would be initiated&#13;
immediately. The results of this component would be evaluated every year by the&#13;
twinning coordinators and the PIU, and the lessons learned would be&#13;
incorporated in the formulation of the subsequent annual training plan.&#13;
The training program would reach all levels of the organization covering&#13;
technical, administrative and management training. Three types of training modes&#13;
would be utilized:&#13;
On-the-iob training. Training needs at all levels would be addressed by&#13;
on-the-job training. This training would consist of planned activities&#13;
conducted at the work site using job tasks as training for the staff. The&#13;
twinning partner would assist by providing the necessary technical&#13;
content to the activities, and in providing training to potential future&#13;
trainers at HWW. In addition to training in their own utility, the trainers&#13;
could be trained at the twinning company.&#13;
Training by external consultants. Training in areas such as information&#13;
systems; including accounting, budgeting and general computer&#13;
knowledge, could be provided by selected specialized external consultants&#13;
working under contract to the company.&#13;
Educational visits overseas to modem, efficiently-run water companies,&#13;
primarily the twinning partner. Introducing new managerial and&#13;
operational approaches would require that the company's staff visit&#13;
appropriate water companies outside of Estonia. Selected staff could&#13;
study at the twinning agency, following preparation of a detailed training&#13;
plan with clear objectives. This activity would be essential because the&#13;
staff upon their return would be responsible for working by themselves&#13;
to initiate and implement up-to-date managerial and operational practices.&#13;
The individual training plans would be prepared in consultation with and&#13;
approved by the Project Implementation Unit.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF ESTONIA&#13;
HAAPSALU AND MATSALU BAYS ENVIRONMENT PROJECT&#13;
WATER AND WASTEWATER IMPROVEMENT COMPONENT&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
A. Overview&#13;
1.    Introduction. Implementation of the Water and Wastewater Improvement Component (WWIC)&#13;
of the proposed Project is anticipated to have positive environmental benefits in the Haapsalu Bay area&#13;
through improved water supply, major expansion of wastewater collection, significant improvements in&#13;
the performance standards of the municipal wastewater treatment plant and improved sludge managemiienit.&#13;
This will improve public health, ecology, water quality and aesthetic conditions in Haapsalu Bay, provide&#13;
protection of curative muds found in the Bay and reduce pollution of the Baltic Sea. The proposed Plroject&#13;
would not involve involuntary resettlement and is not anticipated to have an impact on known&#13;
archaeological or historical sites in Haapsalu or the Matsalu State Nature Reserve.&#13;
2.    Enviromnental Review. The proposed Project component was the subject of a site specific&#13;
environmental review prepared by SWECO (Sweden), in association with Eesti Projekt (Estonia), and&#13;
Bohlin &amp; Stromberg AB (Sweden). The review complies with the Estonian "Order on Carrying Out&#13;
Environmental Impact Assessment (Government Regulation 13.11.92)" and is consistent with the&#13;
provisions for a Category B project under World Bank Operational Directive 4.01, "'Environmlental&#13;
Assessment." The objective was to evaluate the potential environmental impacts from the rehabilitation&#13;
and expansion of water and wastewater facilities of the Haapsalu Water Works (HWW). These activities&#13;
would be implemented by HWW with the support of the Estonian Ministry of Envirolnment, Municipality&#13;
of Haapsalu, Governments of Sweden and Finland and the World Bank.&#13;
3.    Consultation Process. The environmental review for the proposed Project was prepared with the&#13;
full cooperation of the Estonian Ministry of Environment and the Laane County Environmental&#13;
Department. Representatives of the MOE and its Environmental Assessment Board have been involved&#13;
in all stages of development of the proposed Project and have participated in a series of site visits to all&#13;
proposed Project sites. Consultations have been conducted with the representatives of Laane County and&#13;
the local municipalities.&#13;
4.     Present Conditions.&#13;
(a)    Water Supply. Although there are few impacts associated with the existing potable water&#13;
system, the capacity of the existing water reservoirs is too small to meet the requirements&#13;
of flow equalization and water supply during emergency situations. The current capacity&#13;
is 300m3, well below the estimated minimum capacity of 1200m3 that would be required.&#13;
Being able to cope with peak rates of flow for fire-fighting is especially important for&#13;
Haapsalu because of the predominance of historical wooden structures in the center of&#13;
the town which is a major asset for tourism.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 2&#13;
(b)    Wastewater Collection. The length of the sewage system in Haapsalu is 20km, and in the&#13;
adjoining settlements of Uuemoisa and Parlepa, 6km. There are 13 pumping stations in&#13;
Haapsalu's sewage system which convey wastewater to a treatment plant equipped to&#13;
perform mechanical treatment. In Uuemoisa there are 4 pumping stations. The infiltration&#13;
of groundwater into the concrete, ceramic and asbestos-cement pipelines of the sewage&#13;
system is significant, resulting in both excess loading of the treatment plant and pollution&#13;
of local groundwater.&#13;
(c)    Wastewater Treatment and Disposal. The main environmental problems associated with&#13;
current HWW operations concern the discharge of partially and untreated effluent and the&#13;
disposal of sewage sludge. Currently most of the municipal wastewater of Haapsalu is&#13;
treated at a mechanical treatment plant in which the reduction of oxygen consuming&#13;
material and nutrients is poor. The existing wastewater treatment plant is in very poor&#13;
condition. The following problems have been noted at the plant: (i) control of plant&#13;
performance is weak; (ii) grit chambers have not been in operation for several years due&#13;
to operational problems; (iii) primary sedimentation basins are working with a&#13;
heterogeneous load as the inflow to the treatment plant from the main pumping station&#13;
is periodical; (iv) raw sludge is occasionally discharged from the primary sedimentation&#13;
basins; (v) drainage of the sludge composting area is erratic, allowing for water&#13;
accumulation during rainy periods; and (vi) analyses of treated wastewater are performed&#13;
once a month in the Eesti Vesi laboratory in Tallinn as the local laboratory is not&#13;
operating.&#13;
Microbiological loading to the receiving waters is high, and advisory notices against&#13;
swimming have been posted at the beaches near the town. The outfall pipe discharges&#13;
directly into a reed bed at the shoreline and it has been observed that environmental&#13;
conditions in the area have worsened in recent years. Problems associated with this&#13;
discharge are exacerbated by the fact that the treatment works is unable to provide full&#13;
secondary treatment to the capacity of sewage entering the system. Total average&#13;
wastewater flow to the treatment plant (calculated from measured water consumption) is&#13;
5500 m3/d. In rainy periods, the flow to the treatment plant is 1,000 m3 an hour.&#13;
Currently partly treated or untreated wastewater is discharged at a number of different&#13;
locations throughout the Haapsalu area. This has ecological, aesthetic, health, and&#13;
economic implications. The curative muds, used for external and internal health&#13;
treatments, are a prime tourist attraction of Haapsalu. The muds are formed naturally in&#13;
the shallow waters of the Bay and constitute a unique resource which is threatened by&#13;
pollution.&#13;
(d)    Wastewater Treatment Plant Site. The upgrading of the wastewater treatment plant&#13;
involves construction of buildings and process tanks at a large site established in 1962 in&#13;
an area designated for industrial and warehouse/storage facilities. There is no problem&#13;
with housing being close to the plant site or inconsistent proposed future land use in the&#13;
area. Significant space is available at the site for expansion of the facilities.&#13;
5.    Major Findings. The environmental review concluded that the wastewater treatment plant is&#13;
currently hydraulically overloaded. Extending the works to treat a greater volume of wastewater would&#13;
prevent untreated and partially treated sewage being discharged into Haapsalu Bay and the Baltic Sea.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 3&#13;
After upgrading and expansion of the sewage collection network and reconstruction and expansion of the&#13;
wastewater treatment plant, pollution discharged to the Bay and the Sea would be decline significantly&#13;
due to reduced infiltration, elimination of the local discharge outlets and improved treatment efficiency.&#13;
The leakage of sewage to the surrounding soil through worn-out sewers is a possible threat to the quality&#13;
of groundwater. Works aimed at the reconstruction of these sewers must be given a high priority to&#13;
reduce excessive loads to the wastewater treatment plant and groundwater pollution. In addition, the&#13;
sludge treatment process needs to be improved to: (a) reduce the volume of sludge; (b) improve the&#13;
drainability of the sludge; (c) stabilize the organic matter; (d) reduce the odor; and (e) destroy or at least&#13;
control pathogenic organisms.&#13;
6.    It is apparent that point source pollution within Haapsalu is a major problem for water quality.&#13;
In addition to lowering the quality of the receiving waters, thus damaging aquatic ecosystems and the&#13;
curative muds, the discharges of untreated sewage are resulting in unacceptable microbiological pollution.&#13;
Collection and conveyance of these untreated discharges to the treatment plant and provision of the&#13;
appropriate capacity at the utility to treat them is a priority. The infiltration of surface water into the&#13;
system increases the amount of water to be transferred to the treatment plant thus contributing to the&#13;
hydraulic overload of the plant. As the volume of pollution discharged from a treatment plant is related&#13;
to the wastewater flow, a reduced flow of wastewater will mean a reduction in the volume of pollution&#13;
discharged into the sea.&#13;
B. Elements of the Proposed Project Component&#13;
7.    Proposed Improvements. A brief description of proposed water supply and wastewater treatment&#13;
improvements in Haapsalu is provided as follows:&#13;
(a)    Water Supply. Improvements to the water supply system can be divided into two distinct&#13;
categories: those to maintain the current system and improvements aimed at enhancing&#13;
the performance of the system.&#13;
(i)    Operations to Maintain the Current System. The following operations to maintain&#13;
the current system are proposed:&#13;
*     Renovation or exchange of the well pumps; and&#13;
*     Centralizing control of the crucial water supply pumps for optimization&#13;
of the pumping pattern;&#13;
(ii)   Improvements Aimed at Enhancing Performance. The following improvements&#13;
aimed at enhancing performance of the water supply system are proposed:&#13;
*     Construction of a secondary pumping station with a capacity of 600m3/h&#13;
and water reservoirs of 2 x 1000m3;&#13;
*     Construction of pipes from existing bore wells to the reservoirs;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 4&#13;
*     Construction of the main pipeline from the secondary pumping to the&#13;
water network; and&#13;
*     Completion of the construction of bore-well pumping station No. 10;&#13;
(b)    Wastewater Treatment. Improvements to the wastewater system can be divided into two&#13;
distinct categories: those to maintain the current system and improvements aimed at&#13;
enhancing the performance of the system.&#13;
(i)    Operations to Maintain the Current System. The following operations are&#13;
proposed to maintain the current system:&#13;
*      Reconstruction of worn-out sewers and the existing pressure pipelines;&#13;
*     Reconstruction of the pumping stations at Kastani and Aianduse Streets;&#13;
and&#13;
*     Improvement of the performance of the main pumping station by&#13;
replacing the single pump with two smaller pumps and the installation of&#13;
frequency regulated drives in the pumps;&#13;
(ii)   Improvements Aimed at Enhancing Performance. The following operations to&#13;
enhance the performance of the system are proposed:&#13;
*     Elimination of the wastewater discharges to the sea inside the town area,&#13;
including:&#13;
-      the Kreutzwaldi outlet;&#13;
-      the Auto Service outlets;&#13;
-      the Kiltsi road outlets;&#13;
-      the Uuemoisa outlets;&#13;
-     the Supluse Street outlet; and&#13;
-      the Hako outlets.&#13;
8.    Potential Environmental Impacts. The environmental impacts which may result from the&#13;
proposed WWIC have been divided into general impacts and specific impacts:&#13;
(a)    General Impacts. There will inevitably be some environmental impacts associated with&#13;
the construction activities. The magnitude of these activities will depend on a number of&#13;
factors including proximity of housing, length of construction period, working hours, and&#13;
methods of construction but, in the case of large construction projects (e.g., extension&#13;
of the wastewater treatment plant), they have the potential to be locally significant and&#13;
prolonged. In particular such impacts could include noise and vibration, dust releases,&#13;
possible odor releases when working on existing sewage facilities, pollution of surface&#13;
or underground waters due to releases or spillages of material from construction sites,&#13;
disruption of traffic and noise pollution associated with transporting construction materials&#13;
and large items of plant, pollution risk and hazard to the health of construction workers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 5&#13;
if construction is carried out on contaminated land (e.g., areas where HWW sewage&#13;
sludge has been stored). Visual environmental impacts are expected to be minimal and&#13;
no impacts are anticipated to historic structures. None of the water or wastewater&#13;
treatment proposals involve any resettlement of people.&#13;
(b)    Specific Impacts of Potential Water Treatment and Supply Improvement Schemes. The&#13;
particular impacts can be divided into two distinct categories: those to maintain the&#13;
current system and improvements aimed at enhancing the performance of the system.&#13;
(i)    Operations to Maintain the Current System. Renovation and replacement of&#13;
pumps to optimize performance would improve the efficiency of the units and&#13;
lead to energy and cost savings.&#13;
(ii)   Improvements to Enhance System Performance. There would be no negative&#13;
environmental impacts due to the proposed waterlines. The waterlines will enable&#13;
the system to cope much more effectively with peak rates of flow which is of&#13;
utmost importance for fire-fighting. The historic wooden buildings in the center&#13;
of Haapsalu add to the significance of this positive impact.&#13;
(c)    Specific Impacts of Potential Wastewater Improvement Proposals. The particular impacts&#13;
can be divided into those resulting from operations to maintain the current system and&#13;
improvements to enhance system performance.&#13;
(i)    Operations to Maintain the Current System. Undertaking operations to maintain&#13;
the current wastewater system can be expected to have an overall positive&#13;
environmental impact. Replacing, repairing, and renovating sewers, mechanical&#13;
and electrical equipment, and sewage works plant would minimize future failures&#13;
and thus reduce the risk of discharge of untreated or partially treated sewage.&#13;
These actions would improve water quality and be of benefit to public health.&#13;
The reconstruction of worn-out sewers would have a positive impact as the&#13;
leakage of sewage to the surrounding soil and groundwater table would be&#13;
eliminated. Upgrading pumping stations to improve efficiency would save energy&#13;
and reduce costs.&#13;
(ii)   Improvements to Enhance System Performance. Improvements to enhance the&#13;
performance of the wastewater collection and treatment system would also have&#13;
an overall positive impact on Estonia's environment, as described below:&#13;
*     Providing sewerage for currently unsewered areas can be expected to&#13;
improve groundwater and surface water quality as cesspools would no&#13;
longer be required in those areas;&#13;
*     Diversion and interception of domestic and industrial wastewater, which&#13;
is currently discharged to Haapsalu Bay untreated, and providing suitable&#13;
treatment facilities would have an overwhelmingly positive impact on the&#13;
Haapsalu environment. The curative muds would be protected from&#13;
contamination by wastewater;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 6&#13;
*      Extension of the Haapsalu wastewater treatment plant to treat a greater&#13;
volume of sewage would alleviate the current plant overload which&#13;
would improve effluent quality and thus enhance the chemical and&#13;
microbiological quality of Haapsalu Bay and adjoining areas of the Baltic&#13;
Sea. Pollution loads of BOD7, total phosphorus and suspended solids&#13;
would be drastically reduced. In order to gain the maximum&#13;
environrmental benefit, such an extension should also provide sufficient&#13;
capacity to treat the volume of sewage expected from newly sewered&#13;
areas;&#13;
*     In general, noise pollution from the new machinery is not a problem.&#13;
Blowers for the aeration of sewage would be placed indoors to prevent&#13;
noise emissions; and&#13;
The proposed sludge treatment process would generate less odor&#13;
emissions than the present one. Emissions from the new aeration tank&#13;
would be small. The new receiving station for septic sludge, however,&#13;
may at times generate heavy odors and should be designed for later&#13;
connection to a biofilter if deemed necessary.&#13;
9.     Proposed Mitigation Plan. The overall aim of the proposed Project is to implement measures&#13;
which would improve the water supply and wastewater services of HWW. The major environmental&#13;
impact of the Project would result from the improvement in surface and groundwater quality in the&#13;
Project area resulting in improved ecological conditions.&#13;
10.   Few of the impacts of the completed Project would be adverse and none are likely to be&#13;
significant and require mitigation. The impact of construction would be largely limited to relatively minor&#13;
disruption and disturbance. Nevertheless, it should still be possible to reduce the extent of this&#13;
inconvenience by implementing some relatively straightforward measures to minimize these impacts&#13;
through clear requirements in the construction contracts combined with good construction supervision.&#13;
11    Proposed Monitoring Plan. Routine monitoring of water and wastewater for purposes of system&#13;
management is the responsibility of HWW. To support these activities, the Project includes support for&#13;
rehabilitation and enhancement of laboratory equipment. This would provide the means to optimize plant&#13;
performance and to maintain a stable and reliable operational monitoring plan. Overall environmental&#13;
monitoring is the responsibility of the Ministry of Environment which is currently revising its national&#13;
monitoring program on the basis of recommendations from a study jointly conducted by the United States&#13;
Environmental Protection Agency and EU PHARE. It is proposed that data on water quality, biological&#13;
aspects, and contamination of sediments be collected prior to the commencement of any works. The&#13;
monitoring program would be continued as a routine element of the local environmental monitoring&#13;
program to assess the impacts of the various improvement measures and compare with the baseline&#13;
situation to determine the impacts that occur and their significance.&#13;
12.   Institutional Strengthening and Human Resources Development.  The proposed Project&#13;
includes use of a "twinning arrangement" to support institutional strengthening and human resources&#13;
development activities for HWW. These activities would include training for HWW personnel in the&#13;
collection, analysis and application of water and wastewater monitoring to the operation of the utility.&#13;

Regional environment management project including: (a) rehabilitation and expansion of Haapsalu water and wastewater system; (b)&#13;
institutional strengthening and training to support establishment of autonomous water and wastewater utility in Haapslu; (c) design&#13;
and implementation of cost-effective activities to reduce point and non-point source pollution of Matalu Bay from snall settlements&#13;
and agriculture; (d) support for implementation of management plan for Matsalu State Nature Reserve; and (e) sasistanc for&#13;
planning and management of eco-tourism.&#13;

The proposed Project would result in the improved availability of water supply, especially for peak denmand periods; expand the&#13;
wastewater collection network to reduce the discharge of untreated wastewaters; rehabilitate and upgrade the wastewater treatment&#13;
plant to reduce overloading and the discharge of partially treated wastewater and upgrade sludge management All activities&#13;
concerning wastewater treatment would be conducted at an existing site which is removed from rcsidential and commercial areas.&#13;
Activities to support the control of point and non-point source pollution would both reduce discharges into Mat-slu Bay and provide&#13;
for the demonstration of low-cost control methods. These would include the use of ecological engineering methods such as&#13;
constructed wetlands. Activities in the Matsalu Bay State Reserve would implement the approved management plan and focus on&#13;
the management of key ecosystems including valuable coastal meadows.&#13;

An environmental review has been prepared for the proposed project by a joint Estonian and Swedish team consistent with the&#13;
environmental review procedures of Estonia and those of the Bank. Preparation of the study was coordinated with the Min. of&#13;
Environment of Estonia and the local environmental protection office in the project area. Actions would be taken to mitigate&#13;
disturbances during construction and monitoring would be conducted for improvements in the wastewater treatment aystem and on the&#13;
Matsalu Bay catchment. A seminar on Bank environmental assessment procedures was given by Bank staff in Tallinn in 6/93 and&#13;
training was provided for the director of the EIA Department at Bank headquarters and USEPA in 11/94.&#13;
Jus4kadon/Raoonale for EP.wronmenid Category: (reasos for environntal caory slected &amp; explanation of any changes from initi classiiication)&#13;
The proposed project has been placed in environmental screening category 'B u the potential impacts are resticted in scope and are&#13;
largely beneficial. It should be noted that support for improved municipal water and wastewater infrastructurc would focus on the&#13;
rehabilitation and upgrading of existing facilities. The proposed improvements to these facilities have been approved by the Ministry&#13;
of Environment and the local environmental protection office. Activities for improved management of the Matsalu Bay catchment and&#13;
Matsalu State Nature Reserve are not anticipated to have adverse impacts and the nature reserve has long been formally established.&#13;
Actions under the Project would not requirc resettloment of any residents or endanger historic structures.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Haapsalu and Matsalu Bays
            Environment Project will be implemented over four years as
            an environmental management project for the coastal area of
            western Estonia. It will consist of a Water and Wastewater
            Improvement Component (WWIC) and an Environmental Management
            Component (EMC). The WWIC will consist of: a) rehabilitation
            and expansion of the Haapsalu water and wastewater system,
            including equipment and works along with engineering
            services; and b) institutional strengthening and training to
            assist in establishing an autonomous and financially
            independent water and wastewater utility in Haapsalu. This
            will include assistance for tariff restructuring/tariff
            planning and financial operations. The EMC will consist of:
            a) technical and financial support through the Ministry of
            Environment (MOE) for the implementation of selected
            elements of the Management Plan for Matsalu State Nature
            Reserve by coordinating and providing funding for identified
            investments such as access roads, observation towers, and
            information boards; b) design and implementation of a
            program of cost-effective activities to reduce point and
            non-point source pollution of Matsalu Bay from small
            settlements and agriculture; and c) support for planning and
            management of eco-tourism.
