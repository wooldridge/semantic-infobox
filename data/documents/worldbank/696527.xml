I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1          Russian securities markets began operations in 1992 with the launching of the mass&#13;
privatization program and the distribution of a tradeable privatization voucher to every Russian&#13;
citizen. Vouchers were traded mostly through securities exchanges whereas the shares in newly&#13;
privatized companies were traded through an over-the-counter (OTC) market. With mass&#13;
privatization completed (in mid-1994) there are now some 15,000 joint-stock companies with an&#13;
estimated 40 million shareholders, the world's largest capital market on both counts. There are also&#13;
more than 60 licensed exchanges, 600 licensed investment funds, 1000 registered broker/dealers and a&#13;
developing over-the telephone and curb-side secondary share market.&#13;
1.2          Until late 1994, markets have had to function amidst a proliferation of sometimes&#13;
contradictory regulations emanating from and often haphazardly enforced by more than five separate&#13;
government agencies. Since then, several steps have been taken: (i) the establishment in November&#13;
1994 of the Russian Federal Commission on Securities and the Capital Market (RFCSCM) which has&#13;
broad jurisdiction for capital market regulation and development; (ii) the emergence of broker/dealer&#13;
associations operating on an over-the-counter automated quotation trading system in four cities&#13;
(Moscow, St. Petersburg, Ekaterinburg, and Novosibirsk); (iii) in September 1995, the establishment&#13;
of the National Registry Company (NRC), a large-issue shareholders' registry; (iv) the launching in&#13;
September 1995 by RFCSCM of a program for development of unit investment funds intended to&#13;
attract a significant share of domestic savings, including retail investors, into the Russian capital&#13;
market; and (v) the issuance by RFCSCM of regulations designed to protect the rights of shareholders&#13;
in cases of increase of charter capital, which responds to a number of widely reported rights'&#13;
violations during 1994 and 1995. A Law on Securities was passed by the Duma, the Russian&#13;
Parliament, on March 20, 1996. The most important aspect of this law is that it gives legislative&#13;
status to many rules and procedures that previously existed only in the form of Presidential Decrees.&#13;
It also reaffirms the broad jurisdictional mandate of RFCSCM.&#13;
1.3          While the first phase of promoting capital market development focused on facilitating&#13;
voucher-based privatization, the second phase must now focus on building a capital market which is&#13;
sustainable and integrated with the wider financial system and which is able to fulfill its key support&#13;
functions for a private sector economy: the efficient accumulation and allocation of investment&#13;
capital, especially for restructuring and recapitalization of enterprises; the imposition of external&#13;
discipline on corporate governance structures; and the management and sharing of risk among market&#13;
participants with varied risk aversion profiles. Priority development needs include the adoption of&#13;
basic securities policies and regulations within an appropriate legal framework, the building of&#13;
associated institutional capacities, and the establishment of transparent and efficient trading and&#13;
clearance and settlement systems. These tasks will need to be undertaken iteratively and with a high&#13;
degree of flexibility and creativity, because institutions, relationships and transactions are new and&#13;
rapidly evolving, and the shape and direction of market development will not always be clear in&#13;
advance. The regulatory agencies will need to work through myriad policy decisions in an area new&#13;
to Russia, and to support the market as it evolves rather than to impose structures on it. Private&#13;
market participants will need to find a sense of shared purpose which allows them to associate&#13;
effectively with each other, and to develop shared infrastructure and standardized practices. The&#13;
proposed project would help meet key sectoral needs and its design allows for flexibility to respond to&#13;
market evolution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
I. SECTORAL CONTEXT&#13;
A.    Regulatory Infrastructure&#13;
2.1          In 1990 and 1991, two basic regulations on the organization and governance of private&#13;
companies and the circulation of securities were issued by Government. Subsequently, various&#13;
Government agencies adopted rudinentary regulations on broker/dealers, investment funds and&#13;
companies, and registrar/transfer agents. These regulations were in most cases a reaction to the&#13;
market rather than an attempt to give the market a legal and regulatory framework. The new&#13;
securities industry became the subject of jurisdictional struggles between the State Commnittee for&#13;
Property Management (GKI), the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank, and a Presidential&#13;
Commission on Securities which led to duplicating and conflicting regulation. Following several&#13;
investment "pyramid scheme" scandals in mid-1994, the President, in November 1994, established a&#13;
single federal agency for the regulation and oversight of the securities industry, the Russian Federal&#13;
Commission on Securities and the Capital Market (RFCSCM).&#13;
2.2          The RFCSCM has full regulatory and enforcement powers for the securities industry&#13;
and federal ministry status within the executive branch hierarchy. The RFCSCM is formed by&#13;
representatives from eleven government agencies, the Federal Duma and the Federation Council. Its&#13;
executive structure consists of a Chairman, an Executive Director, and a Secretary of the&#13;
Commission. Attachment 1, provides the statutes of RFCSCM and an organizational chart. The&#13;
RFCSCM intends to build up its staff from the present level of 115 to 185 by the end of 1996. Most&#13;
of the staff recruitment will take place through block transfers from other agencies, in particular GKI,&#13;
the privatization ministry. RFCSCM's 1996 budget includes the necessary funding to permit the staff&#13;
size to rise to 185 (the RFCSCM is one of five economic agencies with a priority budgetary status as&#13;
per Government Regulation 1774 of December 1994, and Presidential Decree 202 of February 27,&#13;
1995). RFCSCM's initial institutional objectives aim at setting up efficient administrative systems,&#13;
the training of regulators, the provision of public information, and the development of capabilities in&#13;
the areas of enforcement, licensing standards, and prospectus review. In this, the RFCSCM is&#13;
assisted by the Resource Secretariat (RS) which was created in January 1995, to provide policy advice&#13;
in the areas of market regulations, finance, collective investments, and enforcement. The RS is&#13;
currently funded by bilateral donors but in the medium term may become a financially independent&#13;
"think tank" or public policy institute.&#13;
2.3          The regulations establishing the RFCSCM also establish a consultative body, called&#13;
the Council of Experts (COE), which includes representatives of professional market participants and&#13;
their associations, other public associations, stock exchanges, and independent experts. Currently the&#13;
COE consists of 26 members. The RFCSCM will further be assisted in its nationwide regulatory&#13;
effort by regional branches in republics and regions of the Russian Federation. The regional&#13;
commissions have three primary responsibilities: (i) to monitor compliance with regulations issued by&#13;
the RFCSCM; (ii) to provide information and services to market participants; and (iii) to monitor&#13;
regional market activities. In May 1995, 19 chairmen of regional commissions were appointed by the&#13;
chairman of RFCSCM. The regional network is expected to become operational during 1996 and&#13;
1997, starting in areas where significant capital market activity exists.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.4           RFCSCM's strategic policy objectives for capital market development in Russia are&#13;
summarized in Attachment 1 and include: (i) the development of market mechanisms in order to&#13;
facilitate the accumulation of capital by privatized and newly created enterprises for the purposes of&#13;
their reorganization and development; (ii) the creation of a unified capital market in the Russian&#13;
Federation; and (iii) the creation of conditions for a market-driven development of Russia's securities&#13;
market. In its approach to market regulation, RFCSCM envisages a combined role for itself and self-&#13;
regulatory organizations (SROs) of market professionals. It will set specific guidelines, standards&#13;
and criteria, and license SROs which adopt membership standards consistent with these. RFCSCM&#13;
will continue to exercise regulatory control over licensed SROs.&#13;
B.    Market Instruments&#13;
2.5           Corporate Equity and Debt. To date, primary share issuance in Russia has been&#13;
limited. During 1994, most new securities consisted of shares issued by commnercial banks and bearer&#13;
shares or derivatives stripped of voting rights which were issued and sold by unlicensed investment&#13;
companies of uncertain quality. During 1995, most of the issuances of stock by Russian companies&#13;
have been sales of treasury shares or the issuance of shares in response to a re-evaluation of the&#13;
companies assets as required by law. Since the cessation of soft government credits at the beginning&#13;
of 1995, there has been noticeable interest by Russian companies in raising capital through the&#13;
issuance of securities. Examples of completed offerings include the sale of $13 million in newly&#13;
issued stock by the Moscow-based Red October candy factory in order to add new lines of&#13;
production, and the sale of $3.5 million in newly issued stock by the St. Petersburg Khlebny Dom&#13;
bread factory in order to replace outdated ovens. Both these issuances were sold through public&#13;
distributions in which a Russian lead broker and several Russian selling agents used international-&#13;
standard disclosure documents and responsible advertising to market the shares. In an effort to&#13;
increase liquidity of their shares on the secondary market and create a market for primary&#13;
distributions, at least 20 major Russian companies are in the process of issuing Level-1 American&#13;
Depository Receipts (ADRs) in the United States and/or Eurobonds in the European market.&#13;
Recently, LUKOil placed $365 million in bonds on the international market which are convertible&#13;
into common stock now held by the Government. However, further advances in capital market&#13;
regulation and institutions, not to mention public and international confidence, are needed before&#13;
Russian enterprises will be able to obtain significant financial resources from securities sales. To&#13;
facilitate an increase in the demand and supply of private sector securities, RFCSCM is training&#13;
company directors in 16 cities in how to issue corporate securities. It also intends to help strengthen:&#13;
(i) the corporate finance capabilities of brokers; and (ii) shareholder rights protection.&#13;
2.6           Municipal Bonds. These emerged as a fast-growing segment of the securities market&#13;
in 1994, when the Ministry of Finance registered 28 new municipal issues, versus 14 in 1993 and five&#13;
in 1992. Contrary to the equity market, the market for municipals has remained firm in 1995.&#13;
Domestic demand for municipal issues is high, particularly among retail investors. Comparatively&#13;
low interest rates are compensated for by perceived high reliability and tax privileges and, sometimes,&#13;
by accompanying enhancements such as an apartment, lottery coupons or installation of a telephone.&#13;
Although no municipal issuer has yet defaulted on its obligations, the weak budget management and&#13;
revenue-raising skills of municipal officials give cause for concern. These concerns are reinforced by&#13;
the general obligation form of most municipal issues. A municipal default would be a serious event&#13;
because of its potential to destroy the confidence of retail investors in what has so far been a less&#13;
distrusted segment of the securities market. RFCSCM will help establish a legal framework for&#13;
municipal securities combined with training for local officials and the investing public.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
2.7          Federal Government Obligations. Short-term Government Bonds (GKO), Federal&#13;
Bonds (OFZ) and Treasury Bills (KO) are the most attractive sector of Russia's fixed income market.&#13;
Trading volumes are significantly higher than those in the currency and interbank credit markets,&#13;
reaching about 283 trillion rubles in 1995. As of March 1996, the total volume of GKOs, OFZs and&#13;
KOs outstanding was about 99 trillion rubles, of which about 91 trillion for GKOs and OFZs.&#13;
Several new debt instruments are under preparation, including Government Gold Bonds and&#13;
Government Tax Bonds. Some fifty-six primary dealers are licensed, most of them commercial&#13;
banks, and one exchange, the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange (MICEX), for secondary&#13;
trading  The Government intends to gradually open the market for Government securities to foreign&#13;
investors and is considering to allow terminals to be installed in a number of European financial&#13;
centers to trade GKOs, KOs, and OFzs on the MICEX. Given the volume and diversity of&#13;
Government debt securities, the Ministry of Finance intends to restructure its Department for&#13;
Securities and the Financial Market and to establish a system to track, value and account for the&#13;
Russian Federation's domestic debt.&#13;
C.    Investors&#13;
2.8          Collective Investment Vehicles. These include voucher and cash investment funds,&#13;
pension funds and insurance companies. In any emerging market such institutions have the potential&#13;
to play a major and a beneficial role in capital market development by providing better returns and&#13;
risk management to individual investors, by adding liquidity to the secondary market, and by&#13;
enhancing corporate governance with more professional investment decision-making. In Russia,&#13;
investment and pension funds are especially well-positioned to play such a role for two reasons.&#13;
First, a large number of investment funds already exists. Second, the simultaneous decline of the&#13;
government pension scheme and liberalization of the private pension and insurance industry create&#13;
conditions conducive to the growth of both types of vehicles.&#13;
(a)   Investment Funds. Although investment funds have been operating for more than three years&#13;
(since the beginning of mass privatization), shortcomings in the structure of these funds have&#13;
up to now discouraged broad public participation. Currently two types of investment funds&#13;
exist. Several hundred Special Privatization Funds, commonly called voucher funds, were&#13;
created during mass privatization. Vouchers collected by these funds were invested in shares&#13;
of privatized companies. About 32% of all privatization vouchers turned in by the public&#13;
were invested in these funds, a figure which indicates the potential attractiveness of funds as&#13;
an investment option for the Russian public. However, these funds are closed, i.e. investors&#13;
cannot redeem their shares upon request. The second type of investment fund operating in the&#13;
Russian market is a group of several hundred unlicensed equity funds, known as investment&#13;
companies. Although some of these funds are legitimate, many of them are pyramid schemes-&#13;
with tne MMM Fund the most notorious example. In July 1995, a new collective investment&#13;
vehicle, the Unit Investment Funds (UIF) was established by Presidential Decree No. 765.&#13;
Similar to a mutual fund, the UIF will allow investors to buy a registered security which&#13;
represents a share in the pool of assets held by the UIF. The UIFs will not pay dividends,&#13;
but instead, will generate capital gains for investors through redemption of units. Each UIF&#13;
will be administered by a fund management company and will be affiliated with a depository,&#13;
which will be responsible for custody of assets and for overseeing the placement and&#13;
redemption of units. UIFs will be permitted wide discretion in their investment strategies and&#13;
they will be open-ended, either as "interval" funds, carrying out redemptions at least once per&#13;
year, or as "open" funds, with share redemption within fifteen days of an investor request.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
UIFs, because they are pools of assets and do not have the status of a legal entity, will not be&#13;
required to pay profit taxes; instead, only investors will be taxed on capital gains realized&#13;
when they redeem their units. Voucher investment funds will have the option of either&#13;
retaining their current form or undergoing restructuring into UlFs. Unlicensed funds will be&#13;
required to undergo restructuring into UIFs or face liquidation. RFCSCM has begun a&#13;
program for development of UIFs, including the restructuring of existing funds, pilot UIFs,&#13;
and training of professional specialists. The program also aims at strengthening the regulatory&#13;
protection for investors and at improving the enforcement of existing regulations. The&#13;
program is being funded in part by the Bank's Privatization Implementation Assistance Project&#13;
(Ln 3543-RU). Meanwhile, some of the larger and more professionally-managed funds are&#13;
cooperating in drawing up formal professional standards jointly with one or both of the two&#13;
existing industry associations. RFCSCM is working with both towards establishing an&#13;
investment fund SRO that is capable of assuming substantial regulatory responsibility within&#13;
the industry.&#13;
(b)    Private Pension Funds (PPFs). As of 1995, close to one thousand PPFs were reported to be&#13;
operating in Russia. However, many of these institutions are quite small and of dubious&#13;
character since regulation of PPFs remains weak. The PPF Inspectorate was created in mid-&#13;
1994, but by end 1995 few PPFs had officially registered with the Inspectorate. A draft Law&#13;
on Private Pension Funds which principally serves to define the activities of PPFs is under&#13;
consideration by the Duma. This law would strengthen the position of the PPF Inspectorate&#13;
and provide a more favorable environment for development of an industry SRO. Despite&#13;
these expected regulatory improvements, legitimate PPFs are unlikely to develop in any&#13;
substantial way until the tax regime is modified: Presently, employer contributions to pension&#13;
funds and benefits paid by PPFs are subject to general taxation.&#13;
2.9           Commercial Banks. Banks are active in the Russian securities market as both&#13;
principal investors and as underwriters/brokers. Central Bank regulations presently allow banks to&#13;
invest up to 25% of their own capital in enterprises. A systematic assessment of the actual value and&#13;
extent of commercial banks' enterprise holdings is not possible because of the weak disclosure&#13;
requirements and the practice of accounting for investments at cost. Still, reports published by banks&#13;
themselves and in the business press indicate that a number of major commercial banks possess&#13;
significant investment portfolios and are likely to play a substantial role as investors in the future.&#13;
Discussions with various securities market participants, including banks, confirm that a number of&#13;
major banks have an explicit strategic goal of developing their investment portfolio and that several&#13;
may already have made substantial progress in realizing this goal. Universal banking was confirmed&#13;
by the recently enacted Banking Law. Finally, a consortium of leading Russian banks has entered&#13;
into an agreement with Government whereby the participating banks have tendered for state-owned&#13;
enterprise shares as collateral for extending loans to the Government. However, the "shares for&#13;
loans" program has been widely criticized for a lack of transparency.&#13;
D.    Trading&#13;
2.10          Primary share issuance and hence primary trading have been limited to date as&#13;
mentioned earlier. The bulk of share trading takes place in the secondary market with an estimated&#13;
trading volume in 1995 of $5 billion, and some 50 companies regularly traded/quoted as mentioned&#13;
earlier. Based on a current market capitalization estimate of $20 billion, only 25% of the shares of&#13;
actively traded companies are available for trading. The balance is locked up in the hands of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
Government, enterprise managers and employees, other small investors, institutional (portfolio)&#13;
investors, and strategic investors. At present, 67 % to 75 % of secondary trading takes places off-&#13;
shore, in order to avoid taxes and because of the custody and settlement risk. Stock prices as&#13;
reported by the three most followed Russian stock indices, such as: the Moscow Times Index, the&#13;
Interfax indices, and the AK&amp;M Index which were established in September 1994, stood at 100 on&#13;
September 1, 1994, rose to 120 by the end of September, fell steadily to 60 by February 1995, and&#13;
increased to 90 in June 1995. As of April 19, 1996, the dollar-adjusted Moscow Times Index stood&#13;
at 66.39. Over 60 exchanges are licensed for trading of stocks in Russia, but the largest volume by&#13;
far is transacted through the informal OTC market among major Moscow brokers. It is estimated that&#13;
80% of trading volume is executed in Moscow and that 90% of all volume nationwide is non-&#13;
exchange trading. A notable exception is the Vladivostok International Stock Exchange (VISE),&#13;
which has about 350 listed companies and which due to an eight hour time difference, is able to offer&#13;
off-hours liquidity.&#13;
2.11         One of the emerging trading platforms, the Russian Trading System (RTS), an&#13;
electronic system based on the NASDAQ model, links four major trading centers: Moscow, St.&#13;
Petersburg, Ekaterinburg and Novosibirsk. More than 100 brokerages in these four cities are using&#13;
the system. It is estimated that currently about 40% of all Moscow over-the-counter trading, or about&#13;
15% of all trading nationwide, is carried out over the RTS. Furthermore, quotes on RTS are being&#13;
used as the primary pricing mechanism for about 80% of all OTC trades. Access to the RTS is&#13;
provided only to members of SROs of market participants, currently four - one in each of the&#13;
participating cities. These SROs play an active role in developing and enforcing rules and thereby the&#13;
integrity of the RTS marketplace. There have already been some cases of SROs taking disciplinary&#13;
actions against members who violated the trading rules. Since start-up in October 1994 in Moscow,&#13;
the usage of the system has evolved from a rarely used information system for the display of&#13;
indicative quotes to a market making system exclusively for firm quotes. RFCSCM has supported,&#13;
with bilateral funding, the creation of the RTS and intends to continue to provide support during the&#13;
start-up phase and for expansion of the system to other cities.&#13;
2.12         The RFCSCM, with bilateral financing, also supports The Vladivostok International&#13;
Stock Exchange (VISE), which serves as a trading platform for the Far East and is the only active&#13;
auction exchange in the Russian Federation. It processes trades electronically from remote locations&#13;
and has the potential to be a competing national trading system. Presently, 87 intermediaries are&#13;
accredited to transact on the VISE, including members from firms in nine major Far Eastern and&#13;
Siberian cities. Its trading mechanism is a continuous auction order-driven system. Trading sessions&#13;
take place three days each week and the exchange publishes price quotes and last sale information the&#13;
day after each sale. VISE is the only Russian exchange which has organized itself as a SRO in which&#13;
members must sign agreements that specify the rules, privileges and obligations for membership. As&#13;
such, it is an important model for other regional exchanges.&#13;
2.13         Outlook. Estimates of the proportion of shares of stock companies actually available&#13;
in the public float for secondary trading range from 30% to as low as 15%. The remainder is locked&#13;
up in the hands of managers, employees, the Government and passive institutional investors. Over&#13;
the next five years, the float could increase to between 30-40% if the current intense focus on&#13;
building and holding controlling stakes diminishes. By the turn of the century, market capitalization&#13;
could be in the order of $100-120 billion and annual turnover could reach $50-70 billion.&#13;

E.    Securities Transfer&#13;
2.14          Depository. Clearance and Settlement Functions. The absence of an efficient on-shore&#13;
mechanism for realizing the cash settlement of securities trades in Russia is one of the greatest&#13;
challenges to development of a nationwide securities market. Today, the only nationwide payments&#13;
system in Russia is managed by the Central Bank and requires from two to thirty days for settlement&#13;
of interregional payments. It is uncertain when major improvements in that system will be made.&#13;
Therefore the RFCSCM and its predecessor organization have played an active role in supporting&#13;
regional depository and settlement organizations which market participants have established&#13;
themselves and which have the potential to develop into a world-class clearance and settlement&#13;
network. Their efforts, assisted by donors, have focused on the development of depository and&#13;
settlement organizations in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Ekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, and Vladivostok.&#13;
2.15          To date, the most significant progress has been made in Moscow and Vladivostok. In&#13;
Moscow, the Depository Clearing Company (DCC) was established in 1992 as a closed joint stock&#13;
company. It is structured as a members' cooperative in the sense that the financial institutions which&#13;
use DCC s services are also its shareholders. DCC currently has 20 member/shareholders, including&#13;
Russian brokers, Russian banks, and Russian subsidiaries of Western banks. Membership is expected&#13;
to expand particularly among Russian banks. DCC, in June 1995, settled its first book-entry share&#13;
transfer in Rostelekom stock and introduced full-scale clearing and settlement services in the fall of&#13;
1995. A strategic plan is being implemented with bilateral financing to make it an international&#13;
standard depository and clearance and settlement organization which will process the ownership and&#13;
payments sides of securities trades for its members. In Vladivostok, the Prirnorsky Central&#13;
Depository (PCD), with bilateral financing, is also making rapid progress. It is closely affiliated with&#13;
the VISE and is developing slightly differently from the Moscow model, because equities trading in&#13;
Vladivostok is exchange-based as mentioned earlier. The PCD is perhaps the most advanced in terms&#13;
of book-entry transfer and payment settlement. Similar to the DCC, it continues to need start-up&#13;
assistance while developing as a member-driven organization and moving toward financial viability.&#13;
2.16          In addition to the DCC and PCD, there are several other clearance and settlement&#13;
organizations (CSOs) of a regional nature located in St. Petersburg, Novosibirsk and Ekaterinburg.&#13;
They provide services to local brokerages and will be linked electronically to the DCC, to facilitate&#13;
clearing and settlement among different regions of Russia and establish a nationwide network. The&#13;
RFCSCM intends to support these CSOs on a timeframe consistent with support for the DCC.&#13;
2.17          Share Registrars.  Although Russian companies may issue shares in book-entry or&#13;
bearer certificate form, share ownership is not legally recognized until the investor's name is recorded&#13;
in the issuing company's share register. Investors are then issued a document known as an extract,&#13;
which provides written confirmation of their ownership interest. An unfortunate consequence of this&#13;
system is that management at some privatized companies manipulate their companies' share register in&#13;
order to block transfers of ownership. These conditions clearly impact negatively on market liquidity&#13;
and enterprise corporate governance, although arbitration courts throughout Russia have ruled in&#13;
favor of shareholders when formal complaints were made.&#13;
2.18          Registry services are provided by as many as 800 entities of various legal status -&#13;
specialized registrars and depositaries, commercial banks, investment companies, investment funds,&#13;
brokerage companies and, as mentioned above, special departments located within the share-issuing&#13;
enterprises themselves. About five to ten of these registrars are large with respect to either the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8 -&#13;
number of companies whose registers they hold (the largest client base is 60 companies) or the&#13;
number of shareholders (Gaszprom's registry held by Gazprombank holds over one million names).&#13;
In April 1995, the National Registry Company, a large-issue registrar was established by the Bank of&#13;
New York, IFC, EBRD, and several Russian banks which should stimulate improvements in registry&#13;
services by providing a best practices model and a new standard of performance.&#13;
2.19           The RFCSCM plans to address the systemic registrar problem by fostering the&#13;
development of a nominee-based system used in many other equity markets. Under such a system, a&#13;
transfer of share ownership would not typically take place at the level of the registrar. Rather, it&#13;
would occur at the level of a depository or other market intermediary. At the same time, RFCSCM&#13;
and DCC are also assessing the potential effectiveness of a transfer agent-depository (TAD) model as&#13;
an alternative to the nominee-based system. Under the TAD model, registrars would continue to be&#13;
the final focus of ownership transfer, but would have a direct electronic link with DCC, obviating the&#13;
need for in-person visits to distant registrars. Although the introduction of a nominee-based system&#13;
and/or the TAD model would reduce the significance of registrars in Russia, it would be some time&#13;
before it is fully implemented and registrars would still have a role. Therefore the RFCSCM intends&#13;
to provide broad based registrar support during the next several ycals for training, standards&#13;
development, and the flow of information among registrars. RFCSCM also expects to license a SRO&#13;
during 1996, which could provide a firmer regulatory structure for thze registrar industry. The&#13;
Professional Association of Registrars, Transfer-Agents and Depositories, created in 1994, is the&#13;
leading candidate.&#13;
III. LESSONS OF EXPERIENCE&#13;
3.1           While the Russian capital market presents unique challenges in termns of scale and&#13;
complexity, it shares with many early-stage transition economies a set of characteristics which greatly&#13;
influence capital market development planning. Recent Bank experience and that of bilaterally funded&#13;
projects in Eastern Europe indicate several lessons for project design which are described below.&#13;
3.2           In transitional economies in which the financial sector is at a relatively early stage of&#13;
reformation, experience suggests that a two-pronged approach to capital market development is most&#13;
likely to bring the desired results. First, attention must be paid to building the comprehensive policy,&#13;
regulatory, legal, and institutional underpinnings of the financial market. Second, private sector&#13;
cooperation must be fostered in the development of capital market industry standards and shared&#13;
facilities. There is not a strict time sequence for these activities - they can successfully be addressed&#13;
concurrently - but the degree of success in the second, is dependent upon progress in the first.&#13;
3.3           In many transitional economies, privatization programs have greatly affected the&#13;
course of capital market development. Where privatization has been mass-oriented and rapid, the&#13;
effect has been great and has commonly led to the creation of a capital market framework and&#13;
institutions designed to serve short-term privatization goals rather than long-term financial market&#13;
goals. As the privatization programs have progressed, heightened expectations of the capital market's&#13;
potential contribution to capital raising and to improvements in corporation governance have often not&#13;
been met. It has become apparent in these circumstances that a viable, fully functional capital market&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
can best be created in the context of a broadly viable financial system and that planning for capital&#13;
market development should be conducted in a financial sector context.&#13;
3.4           Because transitional economies typically have a large set of existing institutions in&#13;
both the government and private sectors which are partially performing the functions of a modem&#13;
financial market and are actively pursuing opportunities created by the transition, they present an&#13;
unusually complex and fluid environment in which to plan capital market development. Successful&#13;
programs depend upon establishing early clarity and agreement as to fundamentals and allowing for&#13;
flexibility in implementation to take account of the changing circumstances that inevitably arise.&#13;
3.5           These lessons suggest the following goals and methods for capital market development&#13;
programs in transitional economies:&#13;
a)     Goals appropriate for work in the capital market at an early transitional stage are ones&#13;
which: (i) establish the basic legal and regulatory framework for transactions and&#13;
improve certainty, transparency and uniformity in the application of laws and&#13;
regulations; (ii) protect against systemic disruption or distress and discouraging fraud&#13;
or mismanagement of investors' funds; (iii) encourage development of professional&#13;
standards and ethics in the private sector and efficiency in the provision of services.&#13;
b)     Methods likely to be effective are ones which: (i) emphasize institution building in&#13;
the private sector and government; and (ii) allow a flexible response to changing&#13;
circumstances.&#13;
3.6           The proposed project, with its focus on developing the regulatory infrastructure,&#13;
supporting self-regulation of the securities industry through SROs and providing assistance for the&#13;
start-up of market architecture owned and shared by private participants is fully consistent with these&#13;
lessons.&#13;
IV. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Rationale and Objectives&#13;
4.1           Objectives. The project supports the second phase of capital market development.&#13;
The first phase focused on facilitating voucher-based mass privatization which ended in mid-1994.&#13;
The second phase focuses on building a capital market which is sustainable and integrated with the&#13;
wider financial system. In line with this focus, the project has four specific objectives: (i) build a&#13;
comprehensive policy and legal framework; (ii) build core institutional capacity in regulation and self&#13;
regulation; (iii) improve the efficiency, transparency and systemic stability of market architecture; and&#13;
(iv) ensure the efficient issuance, service, and registration of Russian Federation debt securities, the&#13;
largest segment of Russia's Capital Market. Derived from these objectives, the project has three&#13;
components: the regulatory inrfrastructure component which will establish the policy framework,&#13;
laws, and regulations and the institutional capacity in regulation and self regulation which constitute&#13;
an essential underpinning of modern capital markets; the market architecture component which will&#13;
support private sector organizations in building efficient, fair and secure trading, clearance, settlement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
and registration systems; and the Government Securities Tracking System which will enhance the&#13;
capability of the Ministry of Finance to manage its treasuries program.&#13;
4.2           Rationale. The rationale for choosing these objectives and project components is as&#13;
follows. The regulatory infrastructure for capital markets in Russia is at present rudimentary and is&#13;
widely acknowledged to be an impediment to capital market development because informational and&#13;
contractual uncertainties make transaction costs high and provide strong disincentives to investment.&#13;
Without introduction of a comprehensive legal and regulatory framework, the course of market&#13;
development is likely to follow the pattern of the last two years which have been characterized by&#13;
extreme uncertainty as to contractual rights and a marked lack of reliable information on public&#13;
companies, and by the related phenomenon of large-scale, successful defrauding of investors. With a&#13;
comprehensive regulatory infrastructure: (i) the contractual rights and obligations of parties buying&#13;
and selling securities or owning and managing companies will be clearer in the first instance and,&#13;
where civil disputes do arise, avenues of judicial and extra-judicial resolution will be available and, in&#13;
the criminal area, offenses will be clearly defined and effective investigation and prosecution&#13;
mechanisms will be available; and (ii) the information made available on public companies, major&#13;
shareholdings iin public companies and secondary market trading in securities will be more complete&#13;
and reliable. The project assumes that these are economically beneficial outcomes and are a necessary&#13;
although not sifficient conditions for development of a modern capital market in Russia. The project&#13;
is conceived nf as a focussed technical assistance project to create this part of the necessary conditions&#13;
leaving to follow-on projects other pieces of sectoral development. It does so because establishing the&#13;
required regulatory infrastructure is necessary in its own right, not dependent on other actions and&#13;
projects and is now )irgent and important in support of the Government's second-phase economic&#13;
reform plans. Witw-ut the project's regulatory infrastructure component, the Government would have&#13;
limited capacity to est?b!is' the necessary infrastructure as the need is urgent and large in scale and&#13;
no source o- finance other than the Bank loan is likely to be available to undertake the task. Thus,&#13;
the component addresses a 1priority, un-met developmental need.&#13;
4.3    The market architecture in the secondary market for corporate securities in Russia is at&#13;
present inchoate and in each main functional area (trading, clearance, settlement and registration) has&#13;
been an acknowledgcd impediment to market deveiopment because systemic inefficiencies have raised&#13;
transaction costs and led to default and fraud on a notable scale. Without improvements to the&#13;
fairness, efficiency, and security of the secondary market architecture, it is expected that the price&#13;
discovery mechanism of the market will remain unreliable and that high transaction costs will keep&#13;
volume low. This would diminish the capacity of the secondary market to support efficient risk&#13;
management by portfolio investors such as pension funds, insurance companies, and other collective&#13;
investment vehicles. With improvements to architecture, the expected growth in interest in liquid&#13;
secondary markets could be functionally supported without encountering technical bottlenecks.&#13;
Developing the architecture will not itself lead to greater liquidity but it will facilitate the emergence&#13;
of liquid secondary markets fueled by the growth in institutional investment and portfolio management&#13;
that is expected in the next two to five years. The market architecture component of the project is&#13;
intended as a limited, initial catalyst for development of the necessary private sector institutions and&#13;
for creation of pilot operational systems to establish the basis for the large scale architecture which is&#13;
expected to be ultimately necessary. Under this component advice and equipment to private&#13;
commercial organizations will be provided on a cost recovery basis, and to private non-profit industry&#13;
associations (self-regulatory organizations) on a grant basis. Because of the public benefits generated&#13;
by the early operationalization of such systems, public financial support for them in the nascent stage&#13;
of capital markets has been common since the 1950s in many countries, including Japan, Korea,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
Mexico, and Singapore. The Government securities tracking component ensures that a reliable&#13;
operating system with adequate capacity underpins the issuance, trading, servicing, and redemption of&#13;
treasury instruments.&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
4.4           The project will develop regulatory infrastructure (75% of project cost), market&#13;
architecture (18% of cost), a debt tracking system for Government securities (3%), and supporting&#13;
project management (4% of cost). Each of these is described below.&#13;
4.5           Regulatory Infrastructure ($99.3 million). This component is focused on the&#13;
RFCSCM and will assist it to: (i) build its institutional capacity through management and staff&#13;
development; (ii) establish information systems; and (iii) conduct major program activities in the first&#13;
three years of its operation. Each of these is described below.&#13;
4.6           Institutional Capacity ($39.9 million). This sub-component, based on an institutional&#13;
development plan agreed during negotiations, will (i) assist the RFCSCM in building the institutional&#13;
capacity of its Moscow-based head office and its network of ten regional offices to effectively and&#13;
efficiently carry out all their functions under law; (ii) provide management support (strategic planning&#13;
and policy and program management advice, organizational and MIS design); and (iii) provide&#13;
human resource development (recruitment, induction and training):&#13;
(a)    Head Office and Regional Offices ($9.2 million). This includes the build-up of staff&#13;
and facilities at the RFCSCM head office and the regional offices, funded from&#13;
federal budget resources.&#13;
(b)    Activities in the management support area ($19.6 million) are directed to the&#13;
RFCSCM and its senior management to assist the RFCSCM in an orderly and&#13;
efficient transition to full operational capacity. The core activities are to: (i) provide&#13;
a five-member Policy Advisory Group whose main responsibilities are to provide&#13;
strategic and high-level policy advice to the RFCSCM and oversight of project&#13;
management; (ii) provide a technical support group of eight specialists whose main&#13;
responsibilities are line management of project activities; technical advice to the&#13;
RFCSCM and ensuring the effectiveness of the on-the-job skill transfer to RFCSCM&#13;
staff; and (iii) advisory services for organizational planning and management system.&#13;
The policy advisors will have the following responsibilities: RFCSCM&#13;
Institutionalization; Market Regulation; Communications; Training; and Information&#13;
Technology. The technical advisors will have the following specializations: Trading&#13;
systems, municipal finance, registrars, unit investment funds, depository and custodian&#13;
organizations, pension funds, insurance funds, and enforcement.&#13;
(c)    Activities in the human resource development area ($11.1 million) are directed to&#13;
building the necessary knowledge, skills and experience of the professional staff of the&#13;
RFCSCM to enable them effectively carry out their work. The core activities are: (i)&#13;
deliver 4,500 weeks of local coursework and 600 weeks of foreign coursework; (ii)&#13;
provide 90 foreign and 150 local internships and site visits; and (iii) provide&#13;
structured on-the-job training and skills transfer.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
(i)    The local and foreign coursework will provide 360 RFCSCM staff (185&#13;
headquarters and 175 regional office staff) with induction and introductory&#13;
training and, following acquisition of pre-requisite skills, more detailed and&#13;
technically advanced training in the regulation of securities market institutions,&#13;
instruments and intermediaries and in accounting and legal principles. The&#13;
coursework will be provided by existing financial sector training institutes&#13;
including universities and OECD member-country securities commissions and&#13;
securities industry training institutes but will be structured to meet the&#13;
RFCSCM's specific needs and will not include completion of undergraduate&#13;
or postgraduate degree courses.&#13;
(ii)    The foreign internships and local site visits will complement the coursework&#13;
by providing exposure to the operational reality of securities market regulation&#13;
and the conduct of securities business. The foreign internships will place 90&#13;
RFCSCM staff (30 from head office and 60 from regional offices) with&#13;
operational departments of OECD member-country securities regulators for&#13;
periods of up to three months of structured training and exposure to&#13;
operational policies and methodologies. The local site visits will take 150&#13;
RFCSCM staff to private sector securities market organizations operating in&#13;
the areas for which the staff are responsible for short visits to expose them to&#13;
the operational reality of market practice.&#13;
(iii)   These time-bound coursework and internship activities will be complemented&#13;
by continuous on-the-job training of RFCSCM staff in the execution of their&#13;
duties. This will be conducted mainly through skills transfer from advisors&#13;
contracted under the Information Systems and Regulatory Program areas&#13;
described below.&#13;
The Terms of Reference for each advisory contract will make skills transfer&#13;
and on-the-job training a key deliverable.&#13;
4.7           RFCSCM Information Systems ($14.5 million). This sub-component will provide&#13;
computer hardware, software and telecommunications and office equipment to support the RFCSCM&#13;
in the exercise of its powers and performance of its functions. Activities include functional and&#13;
technical specification, procurement and commissioning of equipment and training of RFCSCM staff&#13;
in its use and maintenance. The sub-component has the following main activities:&#13;
(a)  RFCSCM Administration System and Office Equipment ($5.2 million). For the&#13;
administration system, the project will provide micro computers, local area networks,&#13;
and application software. The latter will be purchased and customized for RFCSCM,&#13;
with software packages supporting both Russian and international accounting&#13;
functionalities. Office equipment will include micro computers, copiers, and fax&#13;
machines for RFCSCM headquarters and regional staff, with estimates based on past&#13;
expenditures for current staff and extrapolated for 185 headquarters staff and 10&#13;
regional offices.&#13;
(b)  RFCSCM Operational System and Market Information Database ($9.2 million). The&#13;
data base will underpin RFCSCM's enforcement, licensing and prospectus operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
A sub-set, containing non-confidential data will provide public access to corporate&#13;
information. The operational system will be custom designed and developed, based on&#13;
collection of data from various sources and in electronic form where possible. It will&#13;
have five sub-systems, such as: registration, monitoring, enforcement, data input and&#13;
output modules, and data base administration. The public access data base will&#13;
periodically down-load non-confidential data from the parent (operational) system on a&#13;
smaller minicomputer using common hardware and software environment and tools.&#13;
This concept will ensure security and data integrity as well as provide a back-up&#13;
capability to the operational system. Both systems will utilize the common&#13;
telecommunications infrastructure. In addition to hardware and software, consulting&#13;
services will be provided for the design of the systems and telecommunications&#13;
infrastructure, management of software development, implementation assistance and&#13;
training, and some procurement assistance (formulation of tender documents and&#13;
evaluation of responsive proposals).&#13;
4.8           RFCSCM Regulatorv Programs ($45 million). This sub-component supports the three&#13;
major program areas of the RFCSCM, providing advisory services, public education materials, and&#13;
regulatory handbooks:&#13;
(a)  Legal Reform ($11.8 million). Policies covering all areas of capital market activity will&#13;
be developed and laws and regulations drafted to put the policies into effect. Formal&#13;
and informal consultations with the private sector will test the effectiveness of draft&#13;
policies and laws in light of evolving market practice.&#13;
(b)  Enforcement. Licensing, and Prospectus Review ($10.9 million). This focuses on the&#13;
development of specific guidelines, interpretations and procedures for conducting the&#13;
principal regulatory operations of the RFCSCM. It also includes on-the-job training of&#13;
RFCSCM staff in the detailed execution of these functions and the production of&#13;
regulatory handbooks. Provision is also made for retaining legal counsel for assistance&#13;
with preparing prosecution briefs.&#13;
(c)  Comin'nications and Public Education ($22.3 million). This component supports a&#13;
broad range of activities. First, it includes conferences, workshops, news services and&#13;
publications for market professionals. Second, it provides for publications, lectures,&#13;
and public advertisements to increase public awareness of the opportunities and pitfalls&#13;
of securities investment. Third, it provides advice, publications and logistic support for&#13;
shareholder groups to understand their rights and the avenues available to them to seek&#13;
civil redress for losses suffered as a result of unlawful actions by company managers or&#13;
securities market intermediaries. Last, it includes the creation and operation of a library&#13;
and public reading room on securities markets matters in general and on the Russian&#13;
securities market in particular.&#13;
4.9           Market Architecture ($24.8 million). This component provides institution building&#13;
advice and technology development during the start-up phase of private sector organizations providing&#13;
secondary market trading services, and clearance and settlement services. These organizations are in&#13;
the process of developing key elements of the securities market and supporting them generates public&#13;
benefits by contributing to the creation of fair and efficient market mechanisms. During negotiations&#13;
it was agreed that RFCSCM will select organizations for participation under the market architecture&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
component in consultation with the Bank. Goods and services will be provided in kind, with design,&#13;
packaging, and procurement carried out by RFCSCM in consultation with the selected organization.&#13;
Insofar as non-commercial organizations are selected, i.e. non-profit industry associations with broad&#13;
membership, there will be no cost recovery. If organizations are selected which operate on a&#13;
commercial basis, Ministry of Finance and RFCSCM will enter with each organization into a supply&#13;
and credit agreement under terms and conditions approved by the Bank. These conditions will&#13;
include (i) a cost recovery of not less than 51 % of the goods and services provided; (ii) a maturity of&#13;
up to 12 years including a grace period of 3 to 5 years; and (iii) an interest rate of up to 2% above&#13;
the Bank's standard variable rate for currency pool loans. It is estimated that up to $9 million will be&#13;
provided to commercial organizations.&#13;
(a)  Secondarv Market Trading ($14.1 million). This sub-component will support the&#13;
development of organizations, agreements, procedures and protocols and the&#13;
procurement of equipment related to building a stable and transparent national secondary&#13;
market in private sector securities.&#13;
(i)    Over-The-Counter Market ($9.6 million). This will expand and up-grade the&#13;
over-the-counter (OTC) market established as a pilot with funding from bilateral&#13;
sources. It will provide consultant services for advice, training and the&#13;
production of model agreements, procedures and protocols, and procurement of&#13;
computer hardware and software and telecommunications. The OTC market is&#13;
based en a participant-owned company, the Technical Corporation, which&#13;
operates the Russian Trading System (RTS), based in Moscow using technology&#13;
licensed by the (US) National Association of Securities Dealers. The RTS has&#13;
well-conceived plans for expansion of its operation, both within Moscow and via&#13;
regional linkages. The project will support upgrading the base system and&#13;
expanding its regional reach by adding three more operational hubs to the&#13;
existing four. It will also work with the regional securities dealers associations&#13;
forming the hubs of the networked system.&#13;
(ii)   Stock Exchanges ($4.5 million). This will provide consultant services for&#13;
advice, training and the production of model agreements, procedures and&#13;
protocols, and computer hardware and software to assist stock exchanges to&#13;
upgrade their operations to meet international standards of efficiency,&#13;
transparency and fairness. From a policy perspective, at least three strong&#13;
regional stock exchanges (the far east, Moscow region and one other) would add&#13;
significantly to expanding retail investment services and improving the pricing&#13;
mechanism of the market. To address this objective in the context of evolving&#13;
market structures the project will support the Vladivostok International Stock&#13;
Exchange, providing assistance with organizational planning and the drafting&#13;
and adoption of trading and listing rules. It will also assist with establishing&#13;
remote access gateways in the far east region. The Vladivostok Exchange is&#13;
technologically linked with the Primorsky Central Depository through common&#13;
hardware and software platforms. The project would finance several key&#13;
improvements in both systems, including upgrading and enhancing the&#13;
operational software so that direct trade input from over-the-counter operations&#13;
can be received, additional hardware and software development tools, and the&#13;
creation of a telecommunication hub for the far eastern areas with a high speed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
direct linkage with Moscow which currently is the sole message switching&#13;
center. Similar assistance will be provided to other exchange-based trading&#13;
platforms, which will be chosen in the light of market developments.&#13;
(b)  Securities Transfer ($10.7 million). This will support the development of organizations,&#13;
agreements, procedures and protocols and the procurement of equipment related to&#13;
building a stable and transparent national clearance, settlement and registration system&#13;
for private sector securities.&#13;
(i)    Clearance And Settlement ($5.0 million). This will expand and up-grade the&#13;
depository, clearance and settlement system established as a pilot with funding&#13;
from bilateral sources. It will provide advice, training and the production of&#13;
model agreements, procedures and protocols. It is expected that the hub of the&#13;
system, the Moscow-based Depository Clearing Company (DCC), will receive,&#13;
in 1997, a major capital injection from new foreign sources including the IFC&#13;
and EBRD. The project, with bilateral financing, will support DCC in its&#13;
continued operation in the period prior to this investment and will, with Bank&#13;
financing, support clearance and settlement organizations outside Moscow until&#13;
market conditions make it financially viable to link them with DCC in a national&#13;
system. Loan proceeds would provide institutional support to the Primorsky&#13;
Central Depository which is closely linked to the Vladivostok Stock Exchange&#13;
as mentioned above, and for the establishment of an additional three clearance&#13;
and settlement organizations. Loan proceeds would further be used to define&#13;
transaction structures/codes, identification schematics, telecommunication norms&#13;
and other standards. They would also finance the custom design, development&#13;
and implementation of application software to manage the registration and&#13;
transfer of ownership functions, to develop links with other commercial&#13;
bank/central bank clearing centers for confirmation of transfer of funds, to&#13;
perform trade settlements and confirmation functions, and to establish electronic&#13;
connections with the stock exchanges. IFC is being consulted on this part of the&#13;
loan.&#13;
(ii)    Registration ($5.7 million). This will deliver programs in the already&#13;
established registrar support center designed to improve the transparency,&#13;
efficiency and fairness of the registration process. It will provide advice,&#13;
training and the production of model agreements, procedures and protocols.&#13;
This complements the investment by the IFC and EBRD in the large-issuer&#13;
registrar based in Moscow,. in that it serves a large number of smaller registrars&#13;
and disseminates the best practice standards used at the large-issuer registrar.&#13;
4.10          Government Securities Tracking System ($4 million). This component will provide to&#13;
the Department for Securities and Financial Markets in the Ministry of Finance a comprehensive&#13;
computer-based system for domestic debt securities management. It will include (i) system design,&#13;
(ii) advisory support for the installation and implementation of the tracking system, (iii) computer&#13;
hardware, telecommnunications, networking, and related software supporting the tracking system; and&#13;
(iv) training of departmental personnel on the tracking system. The International Monetary Fund will&#13;
be consulted on this part of the loan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
4.11         Project Administration ($4.2 million). The project provides support to the RFCSCM&#13;
and Ministry of Finance for project management and administration, including procurement,&#13;
disbursement, accounting, and monitoring and reporting. Project administration will be handled by a&#13;
team of six.&#13;
C. Project Cost And Financing&#13;
4.12         Project Cost. The total project cost is estimated to be US$132 million equivalent (640&#13;
billion Rubles) net of taxes and duties. The estimated costs are summarized in Table 4.1 by&#13;
component and in more detail in Attachment 2. Table 4.2 summarizes project cost by type of&#13;
support. Project costs are based on end-1995 prices and conversions from the local currency at the&#13;
market rate of 4445 Rubles per US dollar prevailing at end 1995. Consultant services costs are&#13;
derived from recent fees quoted for similar specialized services in Bank-financed projects in Russia&#13;
and are estimated per person-month at $5,000 for local and $25,000 for foreign consultants.&#13;
Equipment costs have been derived by Bank staff in consultation with the RFCSCM by extrapolation&#13;
from existing pilot projects in Russia and similar projects in other countries and from projections of&#13;
market growth based on surveys and analysis provided by the RFCSCM. Physical contingencies have&#13;
been estimated at 5% for training, and 10% for equipment and goods. Price contingencies are&#13;
derived from projected MUV inflation of 3.3%, 2.3%, 2.5%, 2.5%, and 2.5% for 1996 to 2000&#13;
respectively.&#13;

It is expected that import duties, value added tax and special tax will be payable on project goods and&#13;
services. The total estimated taxation liability is $29.8 million made up of $9.4 million import duty,&#13;
VAT and special tax on $15 million of imported goods; $1.7 million VAT and special tax on $9&#13;
million of local goods; and $18.7 million VAT and special tax on $89 million of services.&#13;
4.13         Financin,e. The proposed Bank loan of $89 million would be made as a currency pool&#13;
loan at the Bank's standard variable rate and would finance 67% of the project excluding taxes. $25&#13;
million (19%) would be financed by bilateral sources, and the balance of $19 million (14%) by the&#13;
Government. The project financing plan is shown in Table 4.3 below.&#13;
4.14         The Bank loan would finance consulting services and training. It would also finance&#13;
computer hardware, software, communications and networking equipment, office equipment, and&#13;
technical services (printing, media space and time). The bilateral financing will be provided during&#13;
1996 and 1997, continuing institution-building, public information, market architecture, and project&#13;
management programs begun in 1995. Government's contribution includes incremental operating costs&#13;
for the RFCSCM (headquarters and ten regional offices - $13.2 million) and the cost of regulatory&#13;
publications ($5.4 million). It was agreed during negotiations, that Government will fund the project's&#13;
tax liabilities. The Ministry of Finance is designing a mechanism for financing project taxes under&#13;
IBRD loans with federal budget funds, based on annual loan drawdowns and associated tax expenditure&#13;
forecasts from the implementing agencies. This will begin in 1997. RFCSCM will pay project taxes&#13;
incurred in 1996, if any, out of its existing budget.&#13;

V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
A. Project Management&#13;
5.1           RFCSCM will draw on an existing core group of experienced project managers,&#13;
which, since September 1994, has successfully managed eighteen TA contracts under bilateral&#13;
financing, representing thirty-five separate activities at a total amount of about US$71 million.&#13;
Under the overall responsibility of the deputy director for institutionalization and finance, RFCSCM&#13;
will supervise and administer the project using a three tier arrangement and staff with qualifications&#13;
and terms of reference acceptable to the Bank:&#13;
(a)   Proiect Administration Unit (PAU). Six specialist staff will handle the procurement,&#13;
disbursement, accounting and reporting functions of the project including for the debt&#13;
tracking component in the Ministry of Finance. All staff are in place. It was agreed&#13;
during negotiations that RFCSCM will provide the necessary resources required for&#13;
the administration of the project.&#13;
(b)   Policy Advisory Group. Five high-level international expert advisors to the&#13;
RFCSCM on strategic and policy questions in the areas of market regulation,&#13;
institutionalization and finance, communications, training and technology will have as&#13;
part of their responsibilities oversight of the overall direction and quality of the&#13;
project. The advisor on institutionalization and finance, who is a deputy director,&#13;
will have overall project management responsibility as mentioned above. All&#13;
advisors are in place.&#13;
(c)   Technical Support Group. Eight Russian technical specialists, acting in an advisory&#13;

C. Procurement and Disburement&#13;
5.6           Procurement. All Bank-financed goods and consulting services required for the&#13;
Project will be procured, respectively, in accordance with the Bank's 'Guidelines for Procurement&#13;
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995)' and "Use of Consultants by World Bank&#13;
Borrowers and the World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981) . The Bank's standard bidding&#13;
and contracting documents, as appropriate, will be used for International Competitive Bidding (ICB)&#13;
and for engaging consultants. Standard documentation will also be used for International Shopping&#13;
(IS) and National Shopping (NS). Prior Bank reviews of procurement actions will be undertaken&#13;
where indicated by the Guidelines and the procurement thresholds discussed below. A Country&#13;
Procurement Assessment Report for Russia is under preparation and will be completed by the end&#13;
of the fiscal year. The General Procurement Notice has been published on January 31, 1996. The&#13;
project launch mission, planned for June 1996, will include procurement aspects. A summary of&#13;
the proposed procurement arrangements is shown in Table 5.1 and the major procurement activities&#13;

5.7       Goods (12.9 million). Procurement of goods will primarily involve computer hardware and&#13;
software, telecommunications and networking gear, reproduction and office equipment. ICB will be&#13;
used for all goods in packages at an estimated cost of $300,000 or more per contract, i.e. about five&#13;
packages with a total value of about $12.9 million. In the comparison of bids for equipment purchased&#13;
under ICB, Russian manufacturers would be allowed a preferential margin over the competing price of&#13;
imports, as per Bank Guidelines. Readily available off the shelf office equipment, including telephone&#13;
exchanges, copiers, fax machines and micro computers, and grouped in packages under $300,000 per&#13;
contract up to an aggregate amount of $3.8 million, would be procured through International Shopping.&#13;
Smaller and sundry items, including telephones, local area networks (LAN) wiring, library supplies,&#13;
and office supplies, in packages at an estimated value of $50,000 or less and up to an aggregate amount&#13;
of $750,000 would be procured through National Shopping. Four contracts, including customized&#13;
general ledger, payroll and personnel, NASDAQ/Portal, and Stratus applications for RFCSCM, and&#13;
enhancement of existing technical platforms for the Russian Trading System and the Vladivostok Stock&#13;
Exchange and Primorsky Central Depository, which are trading and database systems of proprietary&#13;
nature, at an estimated aggregate amount of up to $900,000, would be procured through direct&#13;
contracting from the original source. Other goods, consisting of textbooks and totalling $0.8 million&#13;
will be financed by bilateral sources.&#13;

handbooks and other materials totalling ($3.5 million in about five packages) and media space and time&#13;
($1.2 million) will be carried out through ICB procedures using the Bank's SBDs for Textbooks or&#13;
suitable bidding documents acceptable to the Bank. Other technical services, consisting of media space&#13;
and time in 1996 and totalling $2.0 million, will be financed by bilateral sources. Official publications&#13;
totalling $5.4 million, will be financed by Government.&#13;
5.9       Training ($14.3 million). Training services, including foreign and local training courses,&#13;
internships, conferences and workshops, will be hired by RFCSCM on the basis of the relevance and&#13;
quality of programs offered by government or private institutions, and to the extent possible, through&#13;
competition, following the design and recommendations of an expert firm on training (that would also&#13;
administer the component) to be hired through short-listing ($0.5 mnillion). The Bank will finance about&#13;
$11.6 million and will disburse on the basis of an annual program approved by the Bank. Other&#13;
training components, consisting of foreign courses, conferences and workshops during 1996 and&#13;
totalling $2.7 million will be financed by bilateral sources.&#13;
5.10      Consulting services ($65.9 million). This will primarily involve institutional and&#13;
operationa! advice, technical systems support, policy development and legal drafting. Twenty eight&#13;
contracts totalling about US$50 million will be financed by the Bank as shown in Attachment 4.&#13;
Consulting services will be procured through short-listing of consultant firms and hiring of individuals&#13;
in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines: Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and the World&#13;
Bank as Executive Agency (August 1981). Bilateral sources will also finance consulting services in the&#13;
areas listed above, totalling $15.0.&#13;
5.11     Incremental Operating Costs ($15.6 million). Incremental operating costs will be financed&#13;
by Government ($13.2 million) and bilateral sources ($2.4 million).&#13;
5.12      Bank Review. Prior Bank review of procurement documentation and approval of contract&#13;
award will take place for all ICB procurement, including media procurement, all direct contracting, and&#13;
the first packages under International Shopping and Local Shopping procedures. All other goods&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
procurement will be subject to post-review. Shortlists and terms of reference, and all procurement&#13;
documentation and contracts with consulting firms for packages exceeding $100,000 will be subject to&#13;
prior Bank review and approval as will be short lists and contracts with individuals exceeding $50,000&#13;
each. Other consulting contracts will be subject to post-review. In addition, Bank staff will monitor&#13;
procurement activities, contract administration and project record keeping during supervision missions.&#13;
5.13      Procurement Information. This will be provided through quarterly reports to the Bank,&#13;
indicating: (i) changes in cost estimates for individual contracts and the total project; (ii) schedule&#13;
changes in procurement actions; and (iii) compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of&#13;
procurement.&#13;
5.14      Supervision by the PAU. Procurement will be the responsibility of the PAU which will be&#13;
staffed with an experienced procurement director, and a procurement assistant, both of whom are in&#13;
place. The procurement director is familiar with Bank procurement procedures, both for goods and&#13;
services, and has worked in Russia during the past two years. As mentioned earlier, RFCSCM has&#13;
developed considerable project management and administration capabilities during the last eighteen&#13;
months, including the capacity to procure and manage multiple contracts and consulting assignments.&#13;
In addition, the consulting contracts under the market architecture component include the provision of&#13;
assistance to RFCSCM with respect to the procurement of associated goods (hardware, software,&#13;
telecommunications equipment).&#13;
5.15      Disbursement. Estimated loan disbursements by category of expenditure and the estimated&#13;
disbursement schedule, based on the ECA profile for finance operations, are shown in Tables 5.2 and&#13;

5.16          Disbursements will be fully documented except that Statements of Expenditure (SOE) will&#13;
be used for expenditures under: (i) contracts of goods valued at less than $300,000; (ii) contracts of&#13;
consultants' firms valued at less than $100,000; and (iii) contracts of individual consultants valued at less&#13;
than $50,000. The required supporting documentation will be retained by RFCSCM until at least one year&#13;
after receipt by the Bank of the audit report for the year in which the last loan disbursement was made.&#13;
This documentation will be made available for review by the auditors and by Bank staff on request.&#13;
Disbursements for the incremental operating costs of the technical support group (which includes staffing&#13;
costs, rents, communications, utilities, office equipment and supplies) will be made against SOEs based on&#13;
actual expenditures against the Bank approved budget of the technical support group. The closing date of&#13;
the loan would be June 30. 2001.&#13;
5.17          Special Account. To facilitate payments of small amounts and payment in local currency,&#13;
the Government will initially establish one Special Account denominated in US dollars in a commercial&#13;
Bank acceptable to the Bank. The selection process and qualifications of this bank are described in the&#13;
next paragraph. The authorized allocation will be $3 million. An initial amount of $0.5 million will be&#13;
deposited once the loan becomes effective. This arnount will be increased to the limit of the authorized&#13;
allocation once disbursements have reached $5 million. The RFCSCM, as implementing agency, will be&#13;
responsible for reconciliation of project accounts with disbursements and replenishment requests and will&#13;
forward these as supporting documents with each application for replenishment.&#13;
5.18          The commercial bank holding the Special Account would be chosen on the basis of open&#13;
competitive bidding, and would, as a pre condition, be required to meet the following eligibility criteria:&#13;
(i)    it should be financially sound as demonstrated by their latest accounts which would be&#13;
audited by an internationally recognized audit firm;&#13;
(ii)    have significant foreign correspondence banking in all major currencies;&#13;
(iii)    have some experience, or at least the capacity to acquire experience, in issuing letters of&#13;
credit, transacting direct foreign payments;&#13;
(iv)    provide a wide range of local banking services, including cash payments, domestic&#13;
transfers, issuance of debit notes, and capacity to maintain several accounts for the Special&#13;
Account;&#13;
(v)    be a member of SWIFT, or plan to use the facility to expedite payments;&#13;
(vi)    be willing and able to issue a Comfort Letter to assure that amounts deposited in the&#13;
Special Account would not be set off, seized or otherwise attached to satisfy amounts due&#13;
to the commercial bank by the Borrower;&#13;
(vii)    be willing and able to adequately maintain accounts as required by IBRD, including regular&#13;
statements, and any other information that may be considered necessary;&#13;
(viii)    charge competitive rates for services and other transactions fees.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
D. Accounts and Audits&#13;
5.19          The RFCSCM will maintain a single set of project accounts, including the Special&#13;
Account. Project accounts are currently being set up and will be in place in June 1996, well before&#13;
planned loan effectiveness. The project records will be audited in accordance with the "Guidelinesfor&#13;
Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Finance by the World Bank' (March 1982). It was agreed&#13;
during negotiations that the Borrower will provide, within six months of the end of each fiscal year, an&#13;
audit report, including a separate opinion by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank, on&#13;
disbursements against SOEs. The separate opinion will mention whether SOEs submitted during the fiscal&#13;
year, together with the procedures and controls involved in their preparation, can be relied upon to support&#13;
the related withdrawal applications.&#13;
E. Supervision&#13;
5.20          The Project supervision plan is shown in Attachment 5. The plan includes the schedule&#13;
for Bank supervision missions, the skill mix required, the staff weeks input, and cost. An average of three&#13;
supervision missions per year are planned. Staff inputs will total 6 staff weeks for the remainder of FY96,&#13;
and 30 staffweeks in FY97. A start-up mission with a launch workshop is planned for June 1996, and&#13;
agreement was reached at negotiations that a mid-term review will be carried out in June 1998. A project&#13;
completion report will be prepared by RFCSCM.&#13;
F. Monituring&#13;
5.21          Project performance will be monitored using: (i) outcome indicators for each of the&#13;
project's three objectives; and (ii) output indicators for each project activity. These are described below.&#13;
5.22          Outcome Indicators. Project outcomes will be monitored using both qualitative and&#13;
quantitative measures of the achievement of the project's objectives. The four objectives are: (i) reduce&#13;
transaciion costs by reducing contract enforcement and information costs; (ii) reduce externalities by&#13;
limiting the incidence of fraud, misinformation and manipulation in the securities market; (iii) improve the&#13;
securities market's price discovery mechanism and strengthen the incentives for improved corporate&#13;
governance by improving the efficiency, transparency and security of the secondary market for corporate&#13;
securities; and (iv) establish a Government Securities Tracking System. Each of these is discussed in turn&#13;
below.&#13;
5.23          Contract enforcement and information costs. At present, there are very few rules and&#13;
standards for securities market transactions and this has led to high costs in gathering information on&#13;
companies and investments and in structuring and enforcing contracts. The project addresses this by&#13;
assisting with the development of a comprehensive policy and legal framework which will provide: (i) a&#13;
baseline of standards and practices; and (ii) improved mechanisms for the enforcement of contractual&#13;
rights. Outcome measures of the impact of these project activities on transaction costs will be indirect&#13;
because the causal link is circuitous and other factors also impact on transaction costs. A mixture of&#13;
quantitative and qualitative measures will be used, including an assessment by private sector market&#13;
participants of the effectiveness of the policy and legal reforms:&#13;
(a)   the trend in the number of public offers of securities providing complete and timely&#13;
information;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
(b)   the trend in the number of public companies publishing complete and timely financial&#13;
reports;&#13;
(c)   the trend in the number of civil claims for damages arising from breach of contract related&#13;
to securities transactions;&#13;
(d)   the efficiency and effectiveness of the resolution of civil claims; and&#13;
(e)    a qualitative assessment of the impact of improvements in the policy and legal framework&#13;
on transaction costs as expressed by knowledgeable market participants in an organized&#13;
survey.&#13;
5.24         Fraud, misinformation and manipuulton externalities. At present there is a high incidence&#13;
of economic externalities arising from fraud, misinformation and manipulation in the securities market.&#13;
This has led to less than optimal economic outcomes when the capital accumulation and allocation process&#13;
has been distorted through mis-allocation of investment to non-productive or poor performing purposes or&#13;
the withholding of investment because of lack of confidence in the integrity of the market. The project&#13;
addresses this by assisting with the development of regulatory and self regulatory capacity to: (i)&#13;
encourage the development of high standards of professional practice among private sector market&#13;
participants; (ii) enforce compliance with the law; and (iii) educate and assist public company owners,&#13;
managers and investors to understand their rights, responsibilities and avenues of recourse. Indicators of&#13;
the success of project outcomes from these activities will be:&#13;
(a)   the trend in the number of significant incidents of fraud, misinformation and market&#13;
manipulation;&#13;
(b)   the trend in the effectiveness of the government response to such incidents (cease orders,&#13;
license suspension and revocation, criminal prosecution);&#13;
(c)   the trend in the number and effectiveness of self regulatory organizations (sub-sectoral&#13;
coverage, adequacy of rules and enforcement capacity); and&#13;
(d)    a qualitative assessment of the impact of improvements in regulatory and self regulatory&#13;
capacity on the mis-allocation and withholding of investment as expressed by&#13;
knowledgeable market participants in an organized survey.&#13;
5.25         Price discovery mechanism and corporate governance incenaves. At present, the&#13;
secondary market in corporate securities is opaque and iliquid which has led to inefficient price discovery&#13;
and very limited price signaling as an input to capital allocation decisions and incentives for improved&#13;
corporate governance. The project addresses this by assisting with development of private sector&#13;
institutions and the procurement of equipment for the operation of securities trading, clearance, settlement&#13;
and registration systems which wiUl: (i) be more efficient, fair and secure; (ii) more effectively serve the&#13;
needs of domestic investors outside Moscow and foreign portfolio investors. Outcome measures will be:&#13;
(a)   the trend in secondary market liquidity;&#13;
(b)   the trend in the proportion of total secondary market trading occurring on authorized over&#13;
the counter markets or stock exchanges compared to off-market trading;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
(c)    the trend in the number of civil claims for damages arising from breach of contract related&#13;
to securities trarisactions;&#13;
(d)    tne efficiency and effectiveness of the resolution of civil claims; and&#13;
(e)    a qualitative assessment of the irmpact of improveiments in the policy and legal framework&#13;
on transaction costs as expressed by knowledgeable market participants in an organized&#13;
survey.&#13;
5.26           Government Securities Tracking Systemi. The outcome ineasure will be an enhanced&#13;
capability of the Ministry of Finance to float domestic securities offerings, account for receipts, project&#13;
deb: service reqiuirer-meints, and monitor the domestic Go-verrnrnent securities market.&#13;
5.27           Output Indicators. As measures of progress towards the planned outcomes, output&#13;
indiicators will be monitored. These are predominantly quantitative measures of progress in&#13;
.mplementation of the project at the mid-terrn and completion of the project. They are summarized in&#13;
Attachment 6.&#13;
G. Stattus of Project Preparation&#13;
5.28           The RFCSCM  has worked closely with the Bank in the preparation of the project.&#13;
Detailed draft terms of refetence haxe a.ready been prepared, and shortlists and letters of invitation are&#13;
unnder preparation foi all project components sch.eduled ,o begin immnediately after loan effectiveness, i.e.&#13;
eight packages totalling about $25 million ot 28% of the Bank loan: (i) training design and administration;&#13;
(ii) RFCSCM management system, (iii) RFCSCM  .Administrative system, (iv) legal policy and drafting, (v)&#13;
entQorcemnenl, (vi) licerLsing of nmaiket participants, (vii) Vladivostok International Stock Exchange and&#13;
Primorskv Central Depository; and (viii) Russian Trading System. All project adminstrative and advisory&#13;
pcrsoiuiel is in place.&#13;
VI. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
6.          Regulatory infrastructure for capital markets in Russia is at present rudimentary and is widely&#13;
acknowledged to be an impediment to capital market development because informational and contractual&#13;
unCertainties make transaction costs high and provide strong disincentives to investment. With its&#13;
regulatory infrastructure component, the project supports the Government's efforts to inrstitutionalize the&#13;
rule of law in capital market activities, providing a crucial underpinning of market development.&#13;
Specifically, it will help put in place a first generation of rules and standards in all areas in which the&#13;
RFCSCM has major jurisdictional responsibilities. It will also build, within RFCSCM. core institutional&#13;
capacity and competency in an area of financial policy hitherto unknowri in Russia. With a comprehensive&#13;
regulatory infrastructure: (i) the contractuai rights and obligations of parties buying and selling securities&#13;
or ov.ruing and managing companies will be clearly defincra; whiere cisil disputes arise, avenues of judicial&#13;
a-nd extra-iudicial resolution will be available and, in the criminal area, offenses will be clearly defined and&#13;
effective investigation and prosecution mechanisms will he available; and (ii) the information made&#13;
available on stock companies, major shareholdings in s(,ck companies and secondary market trading in&#13;
securities will be more complete and reliable. T'he imr,rovemerits in market architecture, which the project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2 9 -&#13;
supports, will catalyze the creation of pilot operational systems, owned and operated by private sector&#13;
institutions, so that the expected growth in liquid secondary markets can take place without encountering&#13;
technical bottlenecks. Developing the architecture will not itself lead to greater liquidity, but it will&#13;
facilitate the emergence of iiquid secondary markets fueled by the growth in institutional investment and&#13;
portfolio management, that is expected in the next two to five years. A system to track the Russian&#13;
Federation's internal debt will enhance the Ministry of Finance's capabilities for managing its domestic&#13;
securities operations and for maintaining efficient and reliable market operations in time largest segment of&#13;
Russia's capital market.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
6.2      One set of risks associated with a project of this nature relates to the difficulties of&#13;
implementation in a time of rapid transition. The project mitigates these risks in two ways: First, all&#13;
three project components will remain important areas tcr developmental activity so long as the market-&#13;
oriented transition is imot completely reversed. Thus, whatever the exact direction or pace of change in the&#13;
capital market, all componernts will need to be pursued by the Government. Furthermore, within each&#13;
component envelope there is scope for reallocation and refinement in light of developments during the term&#13;
of the project. Second, the timing of the project allows the lessons of experience from the last two years&#13;
of capital market development in Russia to be taken into account and thus, in important areas, tne proict&#13;
builds upon existing, although nascent, government and private sector institutions. A second set of risks,&#13;
affecting mainly the market architecture component, relates to acknowledged uncertainties of capital market&#13;
growth. If the pace of market development slows significantly, the public benefits derived frorn building&#13;
trading systems, and clearance and settlement systems, will be reduced, or at least, postponed. Low&#13;
trading volumes will also make it more difficult for these systems to become financially self-sustaining.&#13;
The project would deal with these risks '.y slowing down irmplementation or scaling down the hardware&#13;
components of market architecture, whiie continuing with in:;titutional advice and training.&#13;
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED&#13;
7.1           It was agreed during negotiations that: (ij the Borrower will provide funds for the purpose&#13;

CAPITAL MARKET DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
ORGANIZATION, STAFFING AND PROCEDURES&#13;
OF THE RF COMMISSION ON SECURITIES AND THE CAPITAL MARKET&#13;
Status and Structure&#13;
1.           The Russian Federation Commission on Securities and the Capital Market (RFCSCM)&#13;
was created by Presidential Decree No. 2063 on November 4, 1994 with statutes shown in&#13;
Appendix 1.&#13;
2.           The RFCSCM is formed by representatives from each of the following government&#13;
agencies: Administration of the President, Ministry of Finance, State Committee for Property&#13;
Management, Federal Property Fund, Committee for Antimonopoly Policy and Support for New&#13;
Economic Structures, Ministry of Justice, State Tax Service, Ministry of the Economy, State&#13;
Inspectorate for Non-government Pension Funds, Insurance Supervision Service, and Central Bank.&#13;
The Federal Duma and Federation Council are also represented.&#13;
3.           The regulations governing the RFCSCM establish a consultative body, called the&#13;
Council of Experts. Currently, the Expert Council consists of 26 members, who are representatives&#13;
of investment funds, brokerage companies, banks, stock exchanges, clearing and depository&#13;
companies, the Ministries of Finance and Economy, the Central Bank, the Federal Property Fund, the&#13;
State Committee for Property Management, the law faculty of Moscow State University, and&#13;
independent experts.&#13;
4.           The RFCSCM is assisted in its nationwide regulatoiy effort by Regional Commissions&#13;
(RC). The legal basis and authority of the RCs are established in a Presidential Decree of February&#13;
28, 1995. The Decree requires the RCs to issue warnings to market participants who violate the&#13;
RFCSCM's regulations. If the violations are not corrected within 15 days, the RC must inform the&#13;
appropriate law enforcement authorities and the RFCSCM, which has the authority to suspend&#13;
licenses of market participants. The RCs are chaired by appointees of the Chairman of the RFCSCM.&#13;
The initial 19 chairman were appointed in May 1995. The other members of the RCs are appointed&#13;
by local governments, and at least half of the membership of each RC must be composed of market&#13;
participants.&#13;
5.            A current organization chart for the RFCSCM is shown on page 3 of this attachment.&#13;
6.           RFCSCM's policy on strategic areas of Russian capital market development is&#13;

7.           The staff of the RFCSCM will continue to evolve and increase in numbers during the&#13;
period of 1996-1998. The total staff is expected to stabilize at approximately 185 at headquarters and&#13;
another 175 in the regional offices. The divisions and departments of the RFCSCM will be refined&#13;
and defined during 1996 and 1997. The RFCSCM intends to be a lean and efficient bureaucracy by&#13;
relying on its RCs and on industry self-regulatory organizations to monitor the market and provide the&#13;
first level of supervision and regulation. Half-yearly projections for staff of the RFCSCM and RCs&#13;
are as follows:&#13;

RUSSIA&#13;
CAPITAL MARKET DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
The Policy of the Federal Conmmission on Securities and the Capital Market:&#13;
Strategic Areas of Russian Capital Market Development&#13;
The Federal Commission on Securities and the Capital Market under the Russian Federation&#13;
Government (hereinafter referred to as the Commission) faces the following important tasks:&#13;
regulation of the emerging Russian stock market and its accelerated development. The tasks imposed&#13;
on the Commission are extensive. They include work with brokers, dealers, custodians and other&#13;
intermediaries; securities placement issues; exchange and trading systems operations; custody,&#13;
clearing and settlements; and market activities of investment funds, as well as pension funds and&#13;
insurance companies. In addition, the Commission regulates issues of all types of securities,&#13;
including corporate stocks and bonds, stocks of investment funds, Russian government securities,&#13;
municipal securities and derivatives, as well as their trading.&#13;
The objective of the Commission is to create a structure carrying out legal regulation of investors'&#13;
activities, including their protection, and allowing issuers and market participants to operate in capital&#13;
markets without state interference. The Commission also seeks to create a statutory federal level&#13;
structure which would insure that securities market activities guarantee fair trading and efficient stock&#13;
market operations and also provide maximum motivation for participation in its activities by the entire&#13;
population in all Russian Federation regions. Finally, it seeks to accelerate the creation of a market&#13;
infrastructure whose owners and managers would be its participants, and who can attract domestic and&#13;
foreign investment for the development of Russian companies, and encourage higher standards of fair&#13;
activities and professionalism of all issuers and other market entities.&#13;
For the implementation of these tasks the Commission enacts its policy in three key areas:&#13;
1.    The Commission seeks to develop market mechanisms in order to facilitate accumulation of&#13;
capital by privatized and newly created enterprises for the purposes of their reorganization and&#13;
development.&#13;
This means that:&#13;
a)     neither the Commission nor the Russian Government as a rule will limit Russian issuers'&#13;
access to the domestic stock market. They will require disclosure within necessary limits and will&#13;
strive for the observation of stockholder rights;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -                      Attachment 1&#13;
Appendix 2&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
b)     the Coimimission will seek to develop market mechanisms to make it possible to attract savings&#13;
from the entire population and foreign Investors; to insure dynamic secondary market development; to&#13;
accelerate stock market development foreseeing and satisfying its needs at each development stage in&#13;
order to prevent emergence of monopolistic structures as a means of satisfying Russian companies'&#13;
capital needs.&#13;
For the purposes of the goals in question the Commission shall use World Bank loan proceeds as well&#13;
as other resources in order to:&#13;
Encourage both emergence and establishment (maturation) market participants and market&#13;
infrastructure and their efficient self-regulation;&#13;
Provide training for companies' managers, municipal agencies' administrative staff, brokers and&#13;
dealers; develop and facilitate introduction of a Corporate Code for the medium-sized companies;&#13;
finance model projects on placement of new corporate and municipal securities issues and creation of&#13;
collective investment vehicles,&#13;
/1.sist in development of a data base on issuers as well as methodology for training investors in&#13;
stoc'kholders' rights and their enforcement.&#13;
In Russia, like in other post-communist countries, large multi-purpose enterprises which desperately&#13;
neee capital co-exist with the newly-born capital market incapable of meeting these needs. Russia&#13;
needs, as soon as possible, to get rid of the governing role of the state in satisfying capital needs of&#13;
these enterprises and to prevent the appearance of holding companies as a substitute mechanism for&#13;
attracting capital. These imperatives make the search for capital formation in Russia the top priority&#13;
t. ;k.&#13;
The Government of the Russian Federation, acknowledging the fact that liquidity in the secondary&#13;
market would encourage investors to invest surplus capital into Russian enterprises, initially tried to&#13;
stimulate the secondary market development projects related to the creation of its infrastructure&#13;
(registrars, exchanges and trading systems, clearing and settlement organizations). The on-going&#13;
work on secondary market infrastructure creation, as well as development of regulatory documents on&#13;
financial liabilities and other regulatory documents, are fully aimed at an increase in trading volumes&#13;
and legal reliability of the secondary market, as well cost reduction in the selling and buying of&#13;
securities. This work, and application of the same vehicles to development of the primary market&#13;
now in process, is geared at acceleration of Russia's own capital formation and an inflow of funds&#13;
from abroad with their subsequent re-channeling in reconstruction and development of the Russian&#13;
economy. Encouraging the process of disclosure on issuers and upholding stockholders' rights, the&#13;
Commission will help direct the capital to the most efficient companies in Russia.&#13;
2.     The Commission strives to create a unified capital market in the Russian Federation.&#13;
This means that the Commission will:&#13;
put into operation uaified country standards, develop and enforce them, and assist in developing all-&#13;
Russian market infrastructure;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

- 40 -                       Attachment 1&#13;

Page 3 of 5&#13;
strive to replace, where possible, the direct state regulation for self-regulation, as well as develop and&#13;
support the *ctivities of regional commissions in the sphere of the Russian capital market monitoring,&#13;
and spread information to create a flexible regulation system responding to the market requirements&#13;
with ready access throughout the Russian Federation.&#13;
For the implementation of the defined targets the Commission shall:&#13;
a) use the World Bank loan funds as well as other resources for: creating organizational structures&#13;
of the Commission and the Resource Secretariat; develop a project management system and&#13;
expenditures control system; provide information to managers, establish document control and&#13;
accessibility, dissemination of information, staff hiring and training, office equipment and&#13;
remuneration; provide office space and enlist experts' services; assistance in preparing and&#13;
substantiating amendments to laws and the process of changing the policy of the Government of the&#13;

regulation in registration of issues, licensing, issuing qualification certificates; supervision of market&#13;
participants and self-regulatory organizations; enforcement of legislative and other regulatory acts on&#13;
securities; assistance in developing market participants and market infrastructure;&#13;
b) help accelerate the creation of self-regulatory organizations and regional Commissions and give&#13;
them comprehensive assistance at the initial stage of their development.&#13;
Creating the above-mentioned institutions and assistance to them will guarantee that implementation of&#13;
the projects financed with the World Bank's loan will become an integral part of the work of the&#13;
Commission and the Resource Secretariat. The development of the these systems, support of&#13;
employees' work and consultants' authority specified in these projects will give to the Commission's&#13;
staff and the Russian experts in the Resource Secretariat all the necessary resources to build their&#13;
organizations, to issue regulations and carry out enforcement, and to administer the infrastructure&#13;
projects of the Commission.&#13;
As a form of assistance to the Commission's activities, foreign experts will work jointly with the&#13;
Commission staff and the Russian experts and under their guidance at the Resource Secretariat.&#13;
Should any problems arise in the work of the Commission, foreign experts will write memos, hold&#13;
briefings, develop, assess and discuss solutions for the Commission's policy problems and their&#13;
settlement. They will work in close cooperation with the Russian managers and experts on formation&#13;
of organizational structures, discuss staff selection and training jointly. Executive managers of the&#13;
consulting firms controlling the training projects and infrastructure projects will discuss current issues&#13;
with experts of interested Russian organizations and report directly to the Commission senior&#13;
officials.&#13;
3.     The Commission strives to create conditions for independent development of the Russian&#13;
capital markets on the basis of its own potential.&#13;
This means that the Commission shall:&#13;
strive to strengthen the positions of existing market participants and contribute to the appearance of&#13;
new market participants;&#13;

encourage the development of strong self-financing, self-regulatory organizations and assist in&#13;
unification of capital markets participants in their efforts to build a market infrastructure;&#13;
give an impetus to the development of the key elements of the market infrastructure at the initial&#13;
stages of its development. The subsequent role of the Commission shall be limited to simple&#13;
regulation, namely: offering help to the capital markets participants in developing the mechanisms of&#13;
independent development and financing the elements of infrastructure and their management;&#13;
with the help of regulatory and self-regulatory measures and within the framework of legal reform,&#13;
contribute to the establishment of market transparency and creation of flexible dispute settlement&#13;
mechanisms, thus giving a chance to the victims of the market to make use of the legal, court and&#13;
other forms of civil code applications to cover the inflicted damages;&#13;
not interfere in the development and activities of the Russian capital markets;&#13;
if it deems necessary to protect investors, assist in establishing honest and well-directed markets, and&#13;
encourage competition;&#13;
strive to use market mechanisms or other forms of soft interference, should such interference be&#13;
deemed necessary.&#13;
For the implementation of these tasks the Commission shall:&#13;
use the funds of the World Bank's loan as well as other resources for the purposes of providing&#13;
adequate training to its specialists and the Resource Secretariat personnel on the best methods of&#13;
market regulation;&#13;
train personnel engaged in this area and, if necessary, develop exemplary business management&#13;
approaches and procedures;&#13;
offer help in designing equipment and computer systems, developing management techniques and self-&#13;
regulatory functions of the Russian Trading System, the Depository Clearing Company, Vladivostock&#13;
International Stock Exchange and in implementing other projects on creating the market infrastructure&#13;
as it exists at present as well as with prospects for the future and help the capital markets participants&#13;
in their business management efforts. The Commission will help them to develop and accomplish&#13;
strategic plans to receive on-going technical assistance from private capital financing sources and their&#13;
transfer to private financing;&#13;
help to speed up the process of legal reform in Russia, training judges, lawyers and law students, and&#13;
adoption of a capital markets regulatory base and its implementation.&#13;
The Commission shall act as a catalyst of the development of the market infrastructure for the&#13;
purposes of introducing market regulation; the Commission's initiatives will enable the professional&#13;
capital markets participants to observe the regulatory norms and stimulate their activity in this area.&#13;
Once the possibilities and motivation appears, the Commission will have a chance to adopt regulatory&#13;
&#13;

norms and ensure their implementation by way of audit, training and legal application. The world&#13;
standard registrar project put forward by the Commission serves as a good example and shows one of&#13;
the methods by which the Commission pursues its policy of capital markets development and achieves&#13;
results. The consultants working under the Commission conducted a marlret analysis and developed a&#13;
model registrar and then organized a tender in search of a technical partner. After that the project&#13;
was released for private management and financing.&#13;
This project proved that a world class registrar ca21 be created in Russia. This registrar model gives&#13;
us an opportunity to select high operations standards, which can be later applied to the overall&#13;
Russian registrar activitv. This contributes to creating a self-regulatory organization for the&#13;
registrars, which make their standards public and ensure their implementation with the help of on-&#13;
going audit, training and assistance. A result of the joint effort of self-regulatory organizations and&#13;
the Commission in this program will preclude the access to the market of non-competent organizations&#13;
which violate legislation.&#13;

            Russian Federation - Capital Market
            Development Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Capital Market Development Project
            supports the second phase of capital market development. The
            first phase focused on facilitating voucher-based mass
            privatization which ended in mid-1994. The second phase
            focuses on building a capital market which is sustainable
            and integrated with the wider financial system. In line with
            this focus, the project has four specific objectives: 1)
            build a comprehensive policy and legal framework; 2) build
            core institutional capacity in regulation and self
            regulation; 3) improve the efficiency, transparency and
            systemic stability of market architecture; and 4) ensure the
            efficient issuance, service and registration of Russian
            Federation debt securities, the largest segment of
            Russia's capital market. Derived from these objectives,
            the project has three components: 1) the regulatory
            infrastructure component which will establish the policy
            framework, laws, and regulations and the institutional
            capacity in regulation and self regulation which constitute
            an essential underpinning of modern capital markets; 2) the
            market architecture component which will support private
            sector organizations in building efficient, fair and secure
            trading, clearance, settlement and registration systems; 3)
            the government securities tracking system which will enhance
            the capability of the Ministry of Finance to manage its
            treasuries program.
