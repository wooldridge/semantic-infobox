            and reputation. In 2008, the clients provided 2.1 million
            jobs, served 5.5 million patients, and helped educate 1.2
            million students. The clients reached over 200 million
            water, power, and gas customers, provided phone connections
            to 220 million people, and provided 9.8 million loans to
            micro, small, and medium enterprises. IFC strengthened the
            managerial capabilities of small and midsize firms in many
            countries, helping train thousands of entrepreneurs through
            the business edge and small, medium enterprises toolkit
            programs. IFC laid the foundation for future mobilization of
            private capital for development with the historic launch of
            a subsidiary to manage commercial funds.
