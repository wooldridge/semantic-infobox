RecentEconomicDevelopments&#13;
&#13;
 1.    FYR Macedonia was the least developed republic of the Socialist Federal Republic of&#13;
Yugoslavia,.    By the time of independence in 1991, FYR Macedonia's economy had been&#13;
contracting for more than six years. This contraction accelerated during the first years o f&#13;
independence. Between 1991 and 1994, GDP declined by about 20 percent. The recession was&#13;
 accompanied by hyper-inflation and budget deficits that reached 13 percent o f GDP. The&#13;
 Government launched an impressive stabilization program in1994, centered on a sharp fiscal&#13;
 adjustment and de facto pegged exchange rate, which succeeded in bringing inflation down to&#13;
 single digits by 1996 and reducing the budget deficit to moderate levels.            The decline in&#13;
economic activity leveled out in 1994 andmodest economic growth resumedin 1996.&#13;
&#13;
2.     Duringthe periodof 1996-2000, the Government maintainedmacroeconomic stability and&#13;
undertook a number o f modest structural reforms. Inflation averaged about 2 percent per annum&#13;
during this period and the budget was balanced. However, the current account deficit remained&#13;
highat about 7.5 percent of GDP untilthe Kosovo crisis in1999. Marketpressures forced a 15.5&#13;
percent devaluation o f the denar in mid-1997, but otherwise the de facto peg was maintained.&#13;
The Government embarked on a modest structural reform program which included enterprise&#13;
privatization (albeit largely to insiders), trade reforms, and the first hesitant steps towards labor&#13;
market reform. Following the collapse o f a significant pyramid scheme in 1997, financial sector&#13;
reforms were also begun.&#13;
&#13;
3.      Despite the modest nature o f the reform effort, economic growth gradually picked up,&#13;
with each year inthis periodregisteringa higher growthrate thanthe previous year. In1999 and&#13;
2000 real GDP growth reached 4.5 percent. However, growth remained narrowly based on a few&#13;
key industries (steel and textiles) and the investment to GDP ratio remained fairly low by&#13;
regional standards (21 percent in FYR Macedonia versus 28 percent in fast growing Central&#13;
European countries) while the unemployment rate remained high at over 30 percent through-out&#13;
thisperiod.&#13;
&#13;
4.      The civil conflict in 2001 disruptedthis positive economic momentum. InAugust 2001,&#13;
an internationally mediated cease fire, the Ohrid Agreement, led to an end o f hostilities. While&#13;
direct conflict damage was limited, output contracted by 4.5 percent.            Investment activity&#13;
markedly dropped and defense-related expenditures pushed the budget and current account&#13;
deficits to 7 percent o f GDP. The effects o f the conflict were still clearly felt in 2002 as GDP,&#13;
investment and export growth remained sluggish while the budget and current account deficits&#13;
remained high.&#13;
&#13;
5.      A new Government was elected inNovember 2002 and was confrontedby a deteriorating&#13;
current account deficit following a surge in imports concurrent with sluggish export growth. In&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2002, the current account deficit reached 8.5 percent of GDP and internationalreserves fell to 3.8&#13;
months o f imports. In April 2003, a new IMF Stand-by Arrangement was approved. The&#13;
program focused on fiscal adjustment to reverse transient expenditures associated with the&#13;
conflict in2001 and the pre-election spendingin2002. The budget deficit was abruptly cut from&#13;
5.6 percent o f GDP in 2002 to 0.1 percent o f GDP in 2003, more than one percent o f GDP less&#13;
thanthe IMFprogramtarget. The program calledfor a slight relaxation of fiscal policy in2004&#13;
relative to the 2003 outcome, but in the end the Government tightened further. The overall&#13;
balance shifted to a surplus o f 0.8 percent o f GDP. While the tight fiscal policy helped reduce&#13;
the current account deficit to about 3.5 percent o f GDP in 2003 a number o f one-off factors&#13;
contributed to a deterioration to 8 percent o f GDP in 2004. Also low capital inflows led to a&#13;
reduction inthe import coverage o f international reserves which fell to about 3 months by end-&#13;
2004. The exchange rate anchor has been maintained throughout this period, but the falling&#13;
international reserve cover forced the National Bank o f Macedonia to tighten monetary policy&#13;
even as growth slowed in 2004 and even as the official consumer price index declined,&#13;
registeringan average deflation o f 0.3 in2004 and 2.0 percent at end-December.&#13;
&#13;
6.      The economic recovery in 2003 and 2004 has been somewhat disappointing. Real GDP&#13;
rose to about 3 percent in 2003 and 2004. Such growth rate places Macedonia among the&#13;
slowest growing economies in ECA. Also, the recovery remains narrowly based on a few key&#13;
sectors andthe unemployment rate remains over 30 percent.&#13;
&#13;
7.      The Government has reached an agreement in principle with the IMF on a new 3 year&#13;
Stand-by Arrangement. The program envisages a moderate fiscal expansion in 2005 to a deficit&#13;
o f 0.5 percent o f GDP. Growth appears to be picking up with the reopening o f steel mills under&#13;
new ownership and is now projected to increase to 3.7 percent in 2005. Steel exports are also&#13;
projected to contribute to a reduction in the current account deficit to 6.5 percent o f GDP in&#13;
2005. The debt service ratio i s projected to fall below 10 percent in2005 while the debt to GDP&#13;
ratio will remain under 40 percent. A resurgence in the privatization program i s expected to&#13;
boost privatization revenues which are projected to contribute to a build o f reserves to more&#13;
comfortable level o f 4 months o f imports in2006.&#13;
&#13;
8.      Overall, the macroeconomic framework inFYR Macedonia i s satisfactory as per Section&#13;
2.02 (d)(B) o f the LoanAgreement.&#13;

&#13;
9.      The following report presents actions taken by the Government o f FYR Macedonia to&#13;
meet the specific conditions for release o f the second tranche o f the PSMAL. These conditions&#13;
are referred to in paragraph (d) o f Section 2.02 and specified in Schedule 3 o f the Loan&#13;
Agreement. The first tranche (US$ 10 million) was disbursed on August 17, 2004 following&#13;
loan effectiveness. An audit found the use o f the proceeds satisfactory. The second and final&#13;
tranche i s ready to be released now that the conditions specified in the Loan Agreement have&#13;
been satisfactorily hlfilled.&#13;
&#13;
10.     The Government of FYR Macedonia has made satisfactory progress in carrying out the&#13;
program o f reforms in the Letter o f Development Policy and all the conditions for the second&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
tranche release referred to in paragraph (d) o f Section 2.02 and specified in Schedule 3 o f the&#13;
Loan Agreement have been met as follows:&#13;
&#13;
Pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding the Borrower has adopted new practices for&#13;
procurement of pharmaceuticals, exceptpharmaceuticals from the list agreed with the Bank,&#13;
and new supply contracts sufficient to meet the requirements of the Health Insurance Fund&#13;
(HIF)and healthcare institutionsfor pharmaceuticalsfor at least ayear have been concluded&#13;
by HIF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 11.    The Government has complied with the procurement process specified in the&#13;
Memorandum o f Understanding (Annex 4A o f the Program Document). Bank-approvedbidding&#13;
documents were issued in November, 2004. On March 1, 2005, the Health Insurance Fund's&#13;
(HIF) Public Procurement Commission completed the bid evaluation process and informed all&#13;
bidders ofthe results. The Bank has reviewedthe Commission's report and found it satisfactory.&#13;
&#13;
 12.    While the HIF achieved a savings o f 17% (e 8.57 million) compared to the previous&#13;
tender, the process was not as competitive as had been hoped. The number o f items receiving&#13;
multiple bids was considerably smaller than expected. Out o f a total o f 729 items subject to&#13;
tender, only 268 (37%) received multiple bids-either as part of complete lots or (inthe case o f&#13;
lots with fewer than two complete bids) on an item by item basis. A total o f 309 received only&#13;
one bid. 152 received no bids at all. Virtually all the savings achieved through the tender are&#13;
attributable to the competitive bids. Items receiving multiple bids declined inprice by a total o f&#13;
8.48 million. The net price reduction on items receiving a single bidwas only 66,000.&#13;
&#13;
13.     Underthe FYRMacedonianprocurement law, items receivingless than two bids mustbe&#13;
retendered. Only after a second tender fails to produce additional bidders can negotiations with&#13;
the original bidder proceed. With the Bank's concurrence, the Ministry o f Finance has waived&#13;
this condition in order to allow immediate direct negotiations for items receiving only one bid.&#13;
The HIF's discretion in negotiating these bids is limited. The Procurement Complaints&#13;
Commission has ordered the HIFto accept the initial prices o f all bidders who have an exclusive&#13;
right to market the item in question inFYR Macedonia. Prices can only be negotiated in cases&#13;
where more thanone supplier has a marketingauthorization.&#13;
&#13;
14.     Onthis basis, the HIFhas now signed contracts with 19 o f the 20 winners o f competitive&#13;
bids i.e, those on which multiple bids were received. (The remaining contract has been delayed&#13;
for technical reasons.) The total value o f these contracts i s 14.2 million or 31% o f the total&#13;
value o f the intemational tender. The HIF has also signed 16 contracts for items with a single&#13;
bidder and a single marketing authorization, with a total value o f  12.6 million. Contracts for&#13;
the remainingbids inthis category are inthe final stages of preparation and signing. The HIFis&#13;
preparingto rebidthe remainingitems; i.e. those that have more than one authorized supplier in&#13;
FYR Macedonia but received only one bid in the recent tender. This group consists of seventy&#13;
items with a total estimated value o f 2.6 million. On this basis, the condition i s considered&#13;
satisfied.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 The HIFfinancial control systems audit has been completed and accepted by the Borrower's&#13;
Government and an actionplan based on audit recommendations satisfactory to the Bank has&#13;
been approved by the Government of the Borrower.&#13;
&#13;
 15.     The HIF financial control systems audit has been completed and an action plan&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank and based on its findings has beenprepared. The action planprovides a&#13;
time-bound schedule for: (1) establishing an appropriate policy base for the reforms to the FYR&#13;
Macedonian health care system; (2) imposing fixed budget ceilings on health care institutions&#13;
(HCIs); (3) improving controls over HCI budget execution, reporting, reforecasting and the&#13;
treatment o f arrears; (4) establishing a preliminary set o f financial and service performance&#13;
indicators for all HCIs; (5) strengthening internal and external audit. The Government adopted&#13;
the audit and the actionplan inits May 12,2005 session. The condition i s considered satisfied.&#13;
&#13;
 The Borrower has achieved satisfactory progress in the implementation of the wage&#13;
decompression time-bound actionplan agreed with the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
 16.    The Government has complied with the actions listed in the wage decompression plan,&#13;
included as Attachment 5 o f the Agreed Minutes o f Negotiation. As specified inthe Plan, wage&#13;
decompression was to be implemented in equal installments over a 24 month period, ending in&#13;
April 2006. The Government is in full compliance with this timetable. The condition is&#13;
considered satisfied.&#13;
&#13;
A state administration bodyfor public procurement, without a status of a separate legal entity&#13;
has been established within the Ministry of Finance and is fully operational with staf$&#13;
resources and terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
17.     A Public Procurement Board within the Ministry of Finance, responsible for drafting&#13;
legislation and regulations and overseeing procurement in 2,500 Government departments,&#13;
municipalities, extra budgetaryfunds and state-owned enterprises i s fully staffed and operational.&#13;
The conditionis considered satisfied.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            Conclusion&#13;
&#13;
18.     Inview ofthe overall performance andprogress with the implementationo fthe program&#13;
supported by the Loan, and in compliance with the specific conditions o f release referred to in&#13;
paragraph (d) o f Section 2.02 and listed in Schedule 3 o f the Loan Agreement, the Bank has&#13;
informed the Borrower o f the availability o f the second tranche in the amount o f US$ 19.85&#13;
million.&#13;

            Macedonia - Public Sector Management
            Adjustment Loan Project : second tranche release - full compliance
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The document summarizes progress made
            under a reform program supported by the Public Sector
            Management Adjustment Loan (PSMAL) for Macedonia. The
            principal objective of the PSMAL was to improve public
            sector management in order to provide the basis for
            sustained economic growth, and improve the living conditions
            for the country's poor. While addressing a broad range
            of generic issues of public sector management, the PSMAL
            focused specifically on the management of health care
            expenditures, which are both a source of fiscal risk and a
            key element of the Government's effort to reduce
            poverty. In view of the overall performance and progress
            with the implementation of the program supported by the
            Loan, and in compliance with the specific conditions of
            release referred to in Section 2.02 (d) of the Loan
            Agreement, and described in the attached Tranche Release
            Document, it is recommended that the Bank release the second
            tranche of US$ 19.85 million to the Borrower.
