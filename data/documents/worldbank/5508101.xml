&#13;
&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
&#13;
1.      Country Background. Political instability in Haiti has been recurrent over the last&#13;
two decades. After a return to constitutional order in 1994, an unresolved institutional&#13;
crisis, and contested elections in 2000 compounded political uncertainties and led to a&#13;
reduction in foreign assistance. Following these events, state institutions weakened and&#13;
poor governance practices multiplied. This culminated in another political crisis in early&#13;
2004, and on February 29,2004, President Aristide resigned and left the country. In&#13;
conformity with the Constitution, Mr.Boniface Alexandre, President of the Supreme&#13;
Court of Appeal, took office as the interim president. That evening, the UnitedNations&#13;
Security Council approved Resolution 1529 authorizing the immediate deployment of a&#13;
Multinational InterimForce to help maintain order inHaiti. Followinga consultative&#13;
process, Mr.Latortue was then designated as interim Prime Minister and established a&#13;
government on March 17,2004. On April 30,2004, the United Nations Security Council&#13;
created the UnitedNations Stabilization Mission in Haiti.&#13;
&#13;
2.      After the creation of the transitional government, an InterimCooperation&#13;
Framework (ICF) was preparedunder the leadership o f the government with the support&#13;
of the donor community. It represents a conscious effort to break with the past, to frame&#13;
external assistance on the basis of ajoint identification of the needs, and to realistically&#13;
design programs for the transition period (2004-2006). The structure for the formulation&#13;
and coordination of the ICF was based on three pillars: 1) an Inter-Ministerial Committee&#13;
comprising four ministries under the coordination o f the Ministry of Planning,&#13;
Environment and External Cooperation; 2) a Steering Committee, made up of&#13;
representatives from the government and the donors, responsible for the technical aspects&#13;
of governance, and 3) ten thematic groups involving national and international experts&#13;
from the public and private sectors, civil society, and the international community. One&#13;
of these thematic groups oversees the protection and rehabilitation of the environment.&#13;
&#13;
3.      The Thematic Environmental Group (Groupe ThkmatiqueEnvironnement or&#13;
GTE) examines environmental issues and proposes strategies to address them. Since its&#13;
inception, the GTE has highlighted the catastrophic proportions of environmental&#13;
degradation in Haiti and the link to the welfare of the population and poverty reduction&#13;
efforts. Three priority interventions involving environmental management have been&#13;
outlined: (i) reduction of pressure on wood resources; (ii)  improved environmental&#13;
resource management and planning; and (iii)     sustainable and integrateddisaster risk&#13;
management through the implementation of the National Risk and Disaster Management&#13;
Plan (Plan National de Gestion des Risques et Dkssastres or PNGRD). Given the current&#13;
state of institutional preparedness, considerable institutional strengthening and&#13;
improvement of Haiti's legal and institutional framework are required to improve risk&#13;
reduction efforts, as well as disaster preparedness and emergency response. The proposed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
project focuses heavily on improving the country's capacity to manage the risk of&#13;
disasters.&#13;
&#13;
4.      Natural Hazards and Disasters in Haiti. Haiti is one of the Caribbean countries&#13;
most affected by natural disasters (hurricanes, floods, droughts, earthquakes, etc.). The&#13;
island of Hispaniola lies inthe middle of the hurricane belt and i s subject to severe storms&#13;
from June to October. The effects of tropical storms and hurricanes include wind&#13;
damage, flooding, landslides and coastal surges. These effects are exacerbated by&#13;
environmental degradation, since only about 3.2% of Haiti's natural forest remains.&#13;
Extensive deforestation and the presence of settlements in low areas and infloodplains of&#13;
rivers are key factors in the intensity of the destruction. Indeed, under the present&#13;
conditions, every segment of the Haitian population i s vulnerable to adverse natural&#13;
events. Taking into account the percentage of the population living under the poverty line&#13;
and the fact that the poorest groups are always the worst affected, it is evident that the&#13;
majority of the Haitian population i s at risk.&#13;
&#13;
5.      Besides the hydro-meteorological hazards, Haitihas suffered from serious&#13;
earthquakes inthe past. The country i s located in a seismically active zone and according&#13;
to records kept since the 16thcentury, the Island o f Hispaniola has had at least one major&#13;
earthquake every century. A major earthquake in 1751destroyed Port-au-Prince,&#13;
earthquakes in 1842 and 1904 destroyed Cap Haitien (4,000 fatalities in 1842; 5,000 in&#13;
1904), and there was an 8.1 magnitude earthquake in 1946 in the northeastern Dominican&#13;
Republic which was followed by a tsunami inthe Nagua area (5,000 fatalities). The very&#13;
highpopulation density (upto 40,000 per km2inPort-au-Prince), the largenumber of&#13;
informal structures in slum areas, the weak infrastructure and the lack o f response&#13;
capabilities suggest that another major earthquake would have disastrous consequences.&#13;
The seismological pattern of the faults and studies funded by the UnitedNations&#13;
Development Program (UNDP), show that there i s an important energy accumulationthat&#13;
could trigger a major earthquake anytime.&#13;
&#13;
6.      Haiti's high vulnerability to natural disasters stems also from highlevels of&#13;
poverty, weak infrastructure, a degraded environment, and a history o f ineffective&#13;
governments with serious fiscal problems. Given the poor state o f economic&#13;
infrastructure and lack of preparedness, disasters of lesser magnitude occurring on a&#13;
frequent basis also cause immeasurable impacts on the population and on economic&#13;
assets. Vulnerability reduction and disaster management have received very limited&#13;
attention from past governments. The proposedproject i s intended to lay the foundation&#13;
for improving this situation.&#13;
&#13;
7.      The most recent serious disaster inHaiti occurred on September 18,2004 when&#13;
torrential rain coming with the Tropical Storm Jeanne caused flash floods affecting the&#13;
entire region between Cap Haitien and Port-de-Paix in the North and Gonaives in the&#13;
West. The rain caused not only flash floods but also mudslides cutting the access roads&#13;
to many villages for days. These floods affected an estimated population of 300,000,&#13;
destroying approximately 4,500 houses and claiming more than 3,000 lives. The impact&#13;
of this disaster on Haiti has been especially harsh as the country was still recovering from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the floods o f May 2004 when seventeenhours of continuous rain inthe southeastern&#13;
province of Haiti caused flash floods and landslides inthe areas of Belle-Anse and Fonds&#13;
Verrettes. These floods affected more than 100,000 people with more than 2,000&#13;
dwellings destroyed and 1,000 deaths.&#13;
&#13;
8.       Similarities between the floods of May and September are striking. In both cases,&#13;
the heavy rainfall drove flash flooding and extensive debris flows over extended regions.&#13;
Swollen rivers and debris cut off many of the roads traversing the affected areas along the&#13;
base of the mountains. As the floodwaters flowed into the relatively flatter lands and&#13;
broader channels of the alluvial plain below, they spread out, wiping out riverside&#13;
settlements. The disasters illustrate the continuumbetween severe storms, flooding and&#13;
landslides, where debris-laden floodwaters modify the landscape. Major floods of this&#13;
type are now near-annual events inHaiti and the Dominican Republic and can be&#13;
expected to increase in the future, leading to increased vulnerability.&#13;
&#13;
9.       The UNDP report "Reducing Disaster Risk: A Challenge for Development"&#13;
states that, in Haiti, an average of 93.4 people die every year from natural disasters with a&#13;
relative average of 13.72 people per million of inhabitants. The following chart better&#13;
illustrates Haiti's vulnerability to hurricanes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
10.      Disaster Management Capacity. The national civil protection structure i s in&#13;
charge of risk and disaster management activities inHaiti. The system has several&#13;
coordination levels and includes the following 10ministries and agencies: the Ministry of&#13;
Interior and Local Government; the Ministry of Public Health and Population; the&#13;
Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Communication; the Ministry of Agriculture,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               8&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Natural Resources and Rural Development; the Ministry of Environment; the Ministry of&#13;
Planning and External Cooperation; the Ministry of Social Affairs; the Ministry of Justice&#13;
and Public Security; the Ministry of National Education, Youth and Sport; and, the&#13;
Haitian Red Cross. The system i s headedby the National Risk and Disaster&#13;
Management Committee (Comite'National de Gestion des Risques et des De'sastres,or&#13;
CNGRD), which is composed of the respective ministers and the president of the Haitian&#13;
Red Cross and leadb y the Ministry of Interior. The Directorate of Civil Protection&#13;
(DPC) supports the Ministry of Interior inthis function.&#13;
&#13;
11.      A second level of coordination i s at the technical and executive level where&#13;
executives of ministries and agencies meet to form the Permanent Secretariat o f Riskand&#13;
Disaster Management (Secre'tariatPermanent de Gestion des Risques et des De'sastres,or&#13;
SPGRD). The SPGRD is ledby the General Directorate of the Ministry of Interior and i s&#13;
divided into two branches: a disaster management branch composed of the Emergency&#13;
Operation Center (EOC); and a risk management branch, composed of thematic and&#13;
sectoral committees, which oversees permanent activities.&#13;
&#13;
12.      To implement on a daily basis the coordination of risk and disaster management&#13;
activities, the Pre-Disaster Organization (Organisation Pre-De'sastre,or OPDES) was&#13;
established in 1983, first under the Ministry o f Health and later under the Ministry of the&#13;
Interior. Since the OPDES focused on preparedness without much attention to risk&#13;
reduction, in 1997 the government established the Directorate of Civil Protection, with a&#13;
mandate for risk reduction, response andrecovery; and the OPDES ceasedto function.&#13;
After Hurricane Georges in 1998, the Ministry of Interior developed the PNGRD to guide&#13;
the activities of the DPC and give it a legal framework. Under the transitional&#13;
government established inFebruary 2004, disaster management has been assigned&#13;
directly to the DPC. The government intends to increase the status and capacity of the&#13;
DPC by transforming it into a General Directorate, which would provide it with increased&#13;
autonomy and scope for action. The organization's role is expected to reach beyond&#13;
providing disaster assistanceby setting up an active program to plan for and mitigate the&#13;
impact of adverse natural events. DPC will establish a national risk reduction strategy;&#13;
advise and support the Ministry o f Interior and the CNGRDinits coordinating position&#13;
and; supervise the risk mitigation and disaster preparedness activities carried through the&#13;
different ministries and organizations. Inaddition, the government intends to appoint&#13;
Disaster Management Coordinators at the departmental level.&#13;
&#13;
13.      Ongoing efforts. The transitional government has expressed its intentions by&#13;
committing to a sound strategy, clear goals, and an implementation time frame,&#13;
developed during the ICF. The three main activity components and their goals include:&#13;
(i) institutional reinforcement involving: preparation for the upcoming hurricane season, a&#13;
functioning operational emergency operation center, a training center, three functional&#13;
thematic committees (public awareness, buildingnorms, and land-use planning), risk and&#13;
disaster management units within concerned ministries, and a validated legal framework&#13;
for the DPC and the SPGRD; (ii)    an information systemfor risk identification and&#13;
monitoring involving: an awarenessprogram for the media and decision makers, studies&#13;
about the seismic risk, seismic mapping, seismic activity monitoring system, and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
development of an operational disaster data base, national communication system, and&#13;
detailed risk mapping of three departments, as well as micro zoning of Port-au-Prince;&#13;
(iii) riskmanagementincluding:70operationalcivilprotectionlocalcommittees&#13;
    local&#13;
and early warning systems to be installed inthe South and Artibonite departments,&#13;
&#13;
14.     Riskand disaster management inHaiti also received special interest from the&#13;
international community after Hurricane Georges in 1998 with the investment by the&#13;
UNDP,UnitedStatesAgency for InternationalDevelopment (USAID), andother agencies.&#13;
Their contribution helped develop the National Plan for Risk and Disaster Management&#13;
and the National Response Plan, and establish the first EOC. Many Non-Governmental&#13;
Organizations (NGO) have also worked on the creation of local civil protectioddisaster&#13;
response committees, and some have taken part inbasic risk reduction activities. In&#13;
operational support and technical assistance, the UNDPi s the most prominent agency&#13;
currently active inHaiti. The UNDPrisk and disaster management unit has been&#13;
providing technical assistanceto the DPC since 1998 and focuses on: (i)     capacity&#13;
building; (ii)developing response and preparedness plans; (iii)   strengthening&#13;
preparedness; and (iv) establishing a national training center. Their presence and&#13;
collaboration with the DPC i s a great asset to the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
B. IDA RESPONSESTRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
15.     The Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management Project (ERDMP) has been&#13;
prepared within the ICF strategy explained above in order to provide assistance for the&#13;
rehabilitation of areas affected b y the recent floods and to begin to address deficiencies in&#13;
the National System for Disaster Risk Management (SystdmeNational de Gestion des&#13;
Risques et des Dkssastres). International Development Association (IDA) missions have&#13;
worked with the DPC, inclose collaboration with the UNDP, The Inter-American&#13;
Development Bank (IADB), and the Organization of American States (OAS) to help&#13;
define the scope of intervention and institutional improvements necessary. They have&#13;
also defined the support necessary to enable the DPC to begin to play a more meaningful&#13;
role inrisk and disaster management, and to activate and strengthen the national system.&#13;
&#13;
16.     The project will follow two separate initiatives currently being implemented&#13;
underthe LICUS (Low Income Countries Under Stress) TrustFundof the World Bank&#13;
Group. These initiatives provide support to strengthen the capacity for emergency&#13;
recovery as well as risk and disaster management activities until the ERDMPi s fully&#13;
operational. The first LICUS initiative, worth US$l million, involves measures to&#13;
establish rehabilitation plans and beginemergency interventions (infrastructure and social&#13;
support) to help the population recover from the May 23 floods. Support will also be&#13;
provided for institutional strengthening in disaster management at the national level, with&#13;
a focus on boosting technical, management, and administrative capacity in the DPC. The&#13;
LICUS initiative also assesses the need for capacity buildingin risk and disaster&#13;
management, which will lead to the development of a training program to assist&#13;
government and NGO staff at the national and regional levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17.     The second LICUS initiative, also for US$1 million, will support short-term,&#13;
labor-intensive employment in environmental works, by channeling funds to&#13;
communities through NGOs. It will reinforce government capacity at the national and&#13;
local levels to use contractual arrangements to manage labor-intensive, small-scale&#13;
development projects. This funding will benefit some 40,000 members of poor families&#13;
inrural and urban areas. Capacity of the national structure for disaster riskmitigation is&#13;
expected to be strengthened by this effort. Depending on the success of this initiative, it&#13;
could be expanded to implement part of the small-scale environmental mitigation works&#13;
to be carried out under this proposed project.&#13;
&#13;
18.      The proposedproject will build on the LICUS initiatives. It will finance&#13;
identified works inFonds Verrettes, Belle-Anse, and the region affectedby the floods of&#13;
September 2004, in addition to supporting activities under all three components of the&#13;
government's ICF strategy. The project will strengthen the management and&#13;
administrative systems inthe DPC and finance technical training for the DPC and other&#13;
agencies involved in disaster risk management. It will also support the retrofitting of an&#13;
emergency operation center, the establishment of a training center, and will finance the&#13;
purchase of equipment for national and regional emergency operation centers. Technical&#13;
support will assist inupdating the National Response Plan, establishing emergency funds,&#13;
and increasing the national emergency response capacity. The project will also support&#13;
technical studies, such as the preparationof an environmental assessment study for&#13;
natural disaster vulnerability, public awareness campaigns, and establishing building&#13;
norms for public buildings. Finally, almost 50 percent of the fundingwill be used for&#13;
local risk management to help communities identify and reduce risks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
C. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
&#13;
19.      The development objective of the proposed project will be:&#13;
&#13;
     (a)  to support the rehabilitation of the areas affectedby the recent adverse natural&#13;
          disasters;&#13;
     (b) to strengthen the country's capacity to manage naturaldisaster risks andbetter&#13;
          respond to emergencies resulting from adverse natural events; and&#13;
     (c) to reduce the vulnerability o f communities through risk identification and risk&#13;
          mitigation activities.&#13;
&#13;
20.      These objectives are consistent with one o f the focal points o f the Transitional&#13;
Support Strategy (TSS) that outlines IDA'Sstrategy for Haiti over the next 24 months&#13;
(FY05 and FY06). The TSS explicitly incorporates the activities already submitted to the&#13;
LICUS Trust Fund, including the proposed disaster reconstruction and mitigation&#13;
initiatives mentioned above (paragraphs 16-17). The TSS, being presented to the Board&#13;
together with this proposed operation, also includes in the lending program the proposed&#13;
Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management Project for US$12 million equivalent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21.     The objectives are also consistent with the overall priorities on environmental&#13;
management within the ICF. The longer term objectives of the Environment Thematic&#13;
Group, in which IDA i s an active participant, include the development of sustainable&#13;
strategies to reverse resource degradation by introducing sustainable watershed&#13;
management, reforestation and measuresto reduce the impact of climatic hazards.&#13;
&#13;
22.     The outcome indicators to be monitored during the course of the project include:&#13;
&#13;
    (a) satisfactory planning and completion of a rehabilitation scheme for affected&#13;
        settlements in the regions of Belle-Anse, Fonds Verrettes, and Gonaives;&#13;
    (b) capacity established within the DPCto prepare for, and respond to, natural&#13;
        disaster events which includes: (i) a validated legal framework;(ii) stronger&#13;
        management systems; (iii)  improved technical capacity; and (iv) an operational&#13;
        National Response Plan;&#13;
    (c) functioning disaster committees in at least 70 communes and the successful&#13;
        implementation of riskprevention and reduction measures invulnerable&#13;
        communities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
D. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
23.     The IDA operation will be implementedover a period of approximately four years&#13;
and will finance the following components:&#13;
&#13;
Component 1-Reconstructionand Risk Reduction inthe Areas Recently Affected by&#13;
Floods (US$2.5 million equivalent)&#13;
&#13;
24.     The Government of Haiti (GOH) is preparing a recovery plan to support the&#13;
reconstructionof the areas affected b y recent floods with the assistance of the UNDP.&#13;
The proposed allocation will be used in accordance with the plan and the activities&#13;
implementedwith the LICUS funds, and will assist small rehabilitation activities&#13;
implemented by the affectedcommunities through the financing of buildingmaterials,&#13;
etc.&#13;
&#13;
Component 2 - Institutional Strengthening for the Directorate of Civil Protection (DPC)&#13;
and the Permanent Secretariat for Risk and Disaster Management (SPGRD) (US$3.5&#13;
million equivalent)&#13;
&#13;
25.     Institutional and Technical Support. The project will support the DPC and the&#13;
SPGRD in the implementation of the PNGRD, including: (i) provision of institutional&#13;
                                                                the&#13;
and technical support for the creation o f a training and documentation center and risk&#13;
management units within key ministries; and three thematic committees under the&#13;
SPGRD including public awareness, building norms, and land use planning; (ii)      the&#13;
revision and validation of the National Response Plan and the development o f related&#13;
emergency procedures and protocols; (iii)   the creation, training, and equipping of disaster&#13;
assessment and disaster&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
intervention teams within DPC and key ministries; and (iv) the realization of simulation&#13;
exercises at local and regional scale.&#13;
&#13;
26.     Technical Studies. The establishment of the SPGRD thematic committees will&#13;
leadto the implementation of three main technical studies. First, the public awareness&#13;
thematic committee will supervise the design and implementation of a public awareness&#13;
program directed towards both the general public, and decision makers, to explain&#13;
disaster management efforts to a larger audience. Second, the buildingnorms thematic&#13;
committee will coordinate technical studies and workshops to support the establishment&#13;
of buildingnorms that take natural hazards into account. The initiative will be&#13;
implemented in close collaboration with the Ministry of Public Works and will aim at&#13;
establishing norms from the construction of public buildings and donor funded projects.&#13;
Finally, the project will finance an environmental assessment study for natural disaster&#13;
vulnerability, envisioned to connect the efforts of natural resource management to those&#13;
of planning and risk reduction. This study will be implemented incoordination with the&#13;
land use planning committee and inclose collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture,&#13;
Natural Resources and Rural Development.&#13;
&#13;
27.     Rehabilitation of the Emergency Operation Center(E0C)of the DPC. To enable&#13;
the efficient functioning of the DPC and SPGRD intimes of crisis, the project will assist&#13;
the retrofitting of the national Emergency Operations Center and the purchase of the&#13;
necessary equipment to make it operational. The project will also support the retrofitting&#13;
of regional EOCs ineach department as well as the installation of a national&#13;
communication system to coordinate operations between the national and departmental&#13;
levels.&#13;
&#13;
28.     Strengthening Management Systems within DPC. To better fulfill its functions,&#13;
the DPC i s to become a General Directorate within this calendar year. The project will&#13;
strengthen the DPC with a new accounting system to monitor the funds it disburses and&#13;
an updated inventory system to track its resources. The project will also reinforce&#13;
management, administrative and technical capacity within the DPC and the SPGRD by&#13;
training its staff at the national and departmental levels. Finally, the DPC's planning&#13;
capacity will be strengthened b y supporting institutional development plans. In&#13;
conjunction to the UNDPeffort to define the legal structure of the DPC, the project will&#13;
also support the establishment of emergency fundingprocedures.&#13;
&#13;
Component 3 - Local Risk Management (US$5.5 million equivalent)&#13;
&#13;
29.     Almost 50 percent of the project funds will be usedfor development and&#13;
mitigation activities at the local level in areas o f highvulnerability to natural disasters.&#13;
This component will help DPC create or reactivate local emergency committees and train&#13;
them inrisk and disaster management. These committees, incoordination with&#13;
community councils, will prepare local risk and vulnerability maps and identify risk&#13;
reduction activities (early warning systems, retention walls, terracing, drainage works,&#13;
pilot-reforestation projects, shelter retrofitting, etc.) that the project will finance. Some&#13;
70 local committees are expected to be created or reactivated, 50 percent of which will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
inurban or peri-urban areas. Most activities under this component will be implemented&#13;
usingCommunity Driven Development (CDD), which is already beingused on a pilot&#13;
basis intwo Bank-supportedactivities inHaiti (CDD Pilot Project in Haiti - TF051116;&#13;
and LICUS for Labor IntensiveBasic InfrastructureRehabilitation Pilot Project -&#13;
TF053366). A national-level Government agency (PL 480 Management Office) will&#13;
coordinate the efforts on behalf of the DPC with the DPC directly involved in strategy&#13;
formulation and supervision. Several NGOs selected according to shared criteria between&#13;
IDA and the DPC will be responsible for implementation at the local level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
E. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
30.     Disaster management inHaiti has receivedincreased attention from the donor&#13;
community since about 1998. In2000, a National Risk and Disaster Management Plan&#13;
was produced which emphasized two main objectives: (i)      focus on the causes of risk,to&#13;
reduce the impact of disasters and (ii) reinforce response capacities at every level: central,&#13;
departmental, municipal and community.&#13;
&#13;
31.     In line with the above strategy, the project will work with, and strengthen the&#13;
capacities of, actors involved indisaster management at all levels. The second&#13;
component of the project will be implementedby the DPC andthe SPGRD under the&#13;
Ministryof Interior andLocalGovernment (Minist2rede 1'Znte'rieuret des Collectivite's&#13;
Territoriales),with the UNDPworking closely with these institutions to provide the&#13;
necessary technical assistance.&#13;
&#13;
32.     A national-level government agency, the PL480 Management Office will&#13;
implement the first and third components of the project on behalf of the DPC who will be&#13;
directly involved in strategy formulation and supervision. The organization's mission i s&#13;
threefold: (i) conversion of in kinddonations to money; (ii) management; and&#13;
              the                                                 project&#13;
(iii)&#13;
    financial management along with technical assistance to the donor's projects. The&#13;
P L 480 Management Office has a good record of project implementation with&#13;
international donor partners, and it has a qualified administrative and financial&#13;
management capacity. The organization i s already implementing one of the LICUS Trust&#13;
Fundsof IDA.&#13;
&#13;
33.     The National Committee for Risk and Disaster Management has proven to be a&#13;
useful forum for concerned officials to exchange views on the environment. However, its&#13;
legal status has not been formalized. The project will work to strengthen its participation&#13;
and capacity to draw together various national actors and international partners involved&#13;
inrisk and disaster risk management.&#13;
&#13;
34.     NGOs will also play an important role inimplementing sub-projects at the&#13;
community level. A strong network of NGOs operates throughout Haiti with a long&#13;
history of effective community involvement and disaster risk reduction and preparedness&#13;
activities. Two of these NGOs, the Pan American Development Foundation (PADF) and&#13;
CECI are already working on a World Bank (Post Conflict Fund) funded initiative. Other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              14&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
organizations with strong experience on the ground include CARE, OXFAM, Catholic&#13;
Relief Services (CRS) and World Vision. NGOs will be evaluated according to their&#13;
qualifications, such as voluntarism, nonprofit status, local knowledge, scale of operations,&#13;
reputation, expertise and past performance. A short list of qualified NGOs will be&#13;
prepared (2-3 NGOs) and they will be invited to submit proposals for specific sub-&#13;
projects based on their experience. These NGOs will be contracted on a sole source basis&#13;
under paragraph 3.10 of the Procurement of Consultants guidelines, and the selection of&#13;
these NGOs will be subject to IDA'Sprior review. NGOs will be required to use&#13;
competitive bidding procedures for contracts of more than US$lO,OOO. The methods to&#13;
be used for other sub-projects are shopping for goods, selection based on consultant&#13;
qualifications for firms and Chapter V of the Consultant Guidelines for individual&#13;
consultants. For contracts below the US$lO,OOO threshold, NGOs may use single source&#13;
selection and take advantage of participation in local communities and groups.&#13;
Procurement under sub-projects by NGOs will be subject to the provisions of paragraph&#13;
5, Appendix Ito the Procurement and Consultant Guidelines. NGOs would also be able&#13;
to implement works directly through community participation. All subprojects carried out&#13;
by NGOs will be reviewed, supervised and monitored duringimplementation by the&#13;
PIA80 Management Office.&#13;
&#13;
35.     Because of the importance of disaster risk inHaiti,four donors (UNDP, IADB,&#13;
the Office for Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) and SouthCom) in addition to IDA,&#13;
have indicated a willingness to contribute to the disaster management effort. Teams from&#13;
the various donor agencies have been working in close collaboration to ensure their&#13;
efforts are complementary. The table below shows the plannedcontributions of each&#13;
donor. These initiatives will be implementedby ajoint Project Coordination Unit to be&#13;
established within the DPC.&#13;

&#13;
36.     Overall project implementation will be coordinated by DPC. Given its limited&#13;
experience in project management, the project will finance a Project Coordinator, a&#13;
Procurement Specialist, and a Financial Management Specialist to assist DPC with its&#13;
new and extended functions. The team i s also preparing a submission to the Japanese&#13;
Social Development Fund(JSDF) to strengthen the technical assistance currently&#13;
provided b y UNDP.&#13;

 38.    Frequency of Procurement Supervision. The project will need strong support&#13;
 during the first six months, particularly to develop procurement capacity inthe Project&#13;
 Coordination Unit (PCU) and an understanding of IDA Guidelines. After this initial&#13;
 phase, the project will receive at least one supervision mission to carry out post-review of&#13;
 procurement actions every six months during the first two years and every 12months&#13;
 afterwards, inconjunction with a procurement audit. Basedon the overall risk&#13;
 assessment (HIGH), the post-review field analysis should cover a sample of not less than&#13;
 1in 5 contracts signed.&#13;

F. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND DISBURSEMENT&#13;
&#13;
41.      Financial Management. DPC and the PL480 Management Office will be&#13;
responsible for the financial management of the project. DPC will be responsible for the&#13;
financial management of component 2, while the financial management o f component 1&#13;
and 3 will be the responsibility of PL 480 Management Office. The overall financial&#13;
situation of the project will be consolidated by DPC following procedures that will be&#13;
documented inthe Operational Manual. The findings of the financial management&#13;
capacity assessmentcarried out duringproject preparationb y IDA are taken into account&#13;
inthe arrangements proposed below.&#13;
&#13;
42.      DPC does not currently have an accounting unit since its financial management&#13;
operations are handledby the accounting unit o f the Ministry of Interior. Due to the&#13;
transformation of DPC into a General Directorate and the financial management&#13;
responsibilities under the project, the DPC will be required to set up its own financial&#13;
management system. The project will support DPC in developing a financial&#13;
management system that complies with government accounting rules, satisfies the needs&#13;
of the project, and allows the DPC to manage and account for resources that it will&#13;
receive from external donors. Because it may take time before DPC has fully developed&#13;
its internal financial management capacity, financial management will be handled at&#13;
inception by a qualified accountant to be hired under the project. Hisher Terms Of&#13;
Reference (TOR) will include buildingDPC staff financial management capacity. An&#13;
interimfinancial management systemwill be set upfor the purpose of the project while&#13;
the DPC financial management system is being developed as part of project activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              17&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The establishment of this interim system, including the recruitment of the accountant, and&#13;
the preparation of an Operational Manual, will be a condition of effectiveness of the&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
43.     The PL 480 Management Office i s an autonomous government entity. It already&#13;
has a financial management system and staffing, and its financial statements are regularly&#13;
audited. The PL480 Management Office has solid experience inproject management&#13;
and has recently been involved inthe implementation of a Bank-financed grant. It i s also&#13;
currently updating its operational manual for the purposes of the Labor-Intensive Basic&#13;
Infrastructure RehabilitationPilot Project LICUS TF to reflect the Community-Driven&#13;
Development approach, that will also be used for the Local RiskManagement&#13;
component. The revised manual will reflect procedures such as (i)    channeling of funds to&#13;
NGOs; (ii)  fiduciary control mechanisms; (iii) reporting; and (iv) auditing requirements.&#13;
The fiduciary control mechanisms will address the specific risks associated with&#13;
channeling resources to NGOs. For example, internal mechanisms will be defined for&#13;
monitoring sub-projects, combining both financial and non-financial controls. In&#13;
addition, financial management conditions will be defined for inclusion inthe eligibility&#13;
criteria subprojects to ensure that the amount of the grants i s commensurate with the&#13;
financial management capacity of the recipients. This work will be finalized before&#13;
Grant effectiveness and the revisedmanual will therefore be adequate to the needs of the&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
44.     Disbursement. The flow of funds for this project calls for Grant funds to be&#13;
channeled to the project through two Special Accounts (SA) denominated inUS Dollars&#13;
to be opened in a commercial bank on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. Special&#13;
Account A will be operated by DPC to finance the activities o f component 2; while&#13;
Special Account B will be operated by PL480 Management Office to finance the&#13;
activities of components 1and 3. DPC and P L 480 Management Office will also operate&#13;
a local currency Special Account, to finance project expenditures in local currency. The&#13;
authorized allocation to the Special Accounts A andB will be limitedrespectively to&#13;
US$300,000 and US$600,000 equivalent (representing approximately four months of&#13;
expenditures.) Disbursements will be made on the basis o f Statements of Expenditures&#13;
(SOEs).&#13;
&#13;
45.     Reporting. ConsolidatedFinancial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) will be prepared&#13;
every six months (following the periodicity o f the activity report) reflecting all&#13;
components of the project and submitted to IDA no later than 45 days after the closing of&#13;
the period. The FMRs will include financial, physical progress, and procurement&#13;
information and form part of the project activity report. In addition to the consolidated&#13;
FMRs,DPC and PL480 Management Office will prepare separately, annual financial&#13;
statements reflecting the financial transactions for the respective special accounts they&#13;
manage. The statements will include a statement of sources and uses of funds as well as&#13;
the schedule of SOEs, and a reconciliation of the Special Account.&#13;
&#13;
46.     Auditing. The annual financial statements preparedby DPC and P L 480&#13;
Management Office will be audited annually, in accordance with International Standards&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              18&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
on Auditing, by independent auditors and in accordance with TOR both acceptable to&#13;
IDA. The TOR will make a provision for the specific aspects of the Local Risk&#13;
Management component to ensure that project funds reach their authorized beneficiaries&#13;
and are used for the purpose intended. The auditors will be recruitedno later than six&#13;
months after grant effectiveness.&#13;

&#13;
There are no major environmental or social issues identified. The classification of the&#13;
project i s Category B due to potential adverse environmental impacts of smallmitigation&#13;
activities on human populations or environmentally important areas. At the same time,&#13;
the environmental impacts of reconstruction and mitigation works to community&#13;
infrastructure are likely to be beneficial and to reduce environmental risk.&#13;
&#13;
The project is being processed under OP 8.50 (Emergency Recovery Assistance).&#13;
Consistent with article 13 of OP4.01, the project was exempt from producing a EA report&#13;
before appraisal. A Regional Environmental Assessment (REA) i s planned and will&#13;
cover a majority of the activities implemented under the project.&#13;

&#13;
This component will finance critical reconstruction and riskreductionworks inFonds&#13;
Verrettes, Belle-Anse and the regions of Gonaives recently affectedby floods. The&#13;
component will finance technical assistance to organize and design rehabilitation works.&#13;
Works will consist mainly of rehabilitation of drainage systems, public buildings&#13;
(including schools and clinics), and community centers. The DPC will work in&#13;
collaboration with the related ministries and local communities for the identification of&#13;
these works to be contracted by PL480 Management Office. Many of the works have&#13;
been identified within the framework of the ongoing LICUS funded project.&#13;

&#13;
    (ii)   Riskmanagement unitsin selected ministries. Among the ten ministries&#13;
           constituting the National Committee of Risk and Disaster Management, a unit&#13;
           was established within the Ministry of Public Health and Population in 2001.&#13;
           The goal i s to strengthen this unit, and create three new ones inthe Ministry of&#13;
           Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development, the Ministry of&#13;
           National Education, Youth and Sport, and the Ministry of Social Affairs. The&#13;
           SPGRD will conduct joint workshops to bringeach ministry's activities in&#13;
           perspective inline with the ICF goals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             22&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    (iii)   Three thematic committees within the SPGRD. Three topics have been&#13;
            prioritized as the most urgent ones by the SPGRD. These are public&#13;
            awareness; buildingnorms; and land-use planning. The SPGRD will establish&#13;
            these committees and chair and monitor their activities, including the&#13;
            coordination of technical studies described below. The project will finance&#13;
            technical assistance and the organization of workshops to support the&#13;
            activities of these committees.&#13;
&#13;
This sub-component will also finance technical assistancefor the revision and validation&#13;
of the National Response Plan in accordance with the new responsibilities and&#13;
organization o f the DPC; the development of emergency procedures and protocols to&#13;
allow better operation coordination and resource management; and the drafting of a&#13;
national resource mobilization plan to complement the National Response Plan.&#13;
&#13;
The sub-component will also finance the creation, training, and equipment of disaster&#13;
assessment and disaster interventionteams within DPC and key ministries. The DPC will&#13;
establish new teams for disaster assessment and disaster response and will have the&#13;
resources to train and equip them. To reinforce the technical skills of the national and&#13;
departmental staff, the DPC will arrange technical training indisaster management&#13;
operations; warning systems; communication systems; mitigation project planning;&#13;
disaster recovery operations; and business continuity for the public and private sectors.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, the sub-component will support an emergency simulation exercise to assess the&#13;
capacities inplace at the end of the project's second year. An international consultant&#13;
will be hired to provide technical assistanceto support DPC inthe design,&#13;
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the exercise. The consultant will work in&#13;
close collaboration with the DPC andthe SPGRD and will be responsible for providing&#13;
the necessary training in exercise simulation techniques, from design to evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
Technical Studies CUS$464,000 equivalent): The establishment of three thematic&#13;
committees under the SPGRD will lead to three essential technical initiativeshtudies: a&#13;
public awareness program, an initiative for buildingnorms and, an environmental&#13;
assessment study for natural disaster vulnerability.&#13;
&#13;
The objective of the public awareness program i s to initiate a national risk and disaster&#13;
management culture. For this, the program will be used to inform the general public and&#13;
decision makers about the national risk and disaster management system, disseminate&#13;
information about how to get involved and what they can do to protect themselves, their&#13;
communities, and their businesses. Different campaigns will be designed for the general&#13;
public and the decision makers. The essential aspects of the program include the: (a)&#13;
prioritization of audiences and design of awareness campaigns; (b) production of&#13;
campaign material; and (c) implementation o f the campaigns. The public awareness&#13;
thematic committee will supervise the program and, in addition to the international and&#13;
national consultants working inthe thematic committee, a national consultant will be&#13;
hired to assist in the design and implementation of the campaigns and the development of&#13;
the appropriate didactic material.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             23&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
There i s no official buildingcode inHaiti. The DPC and the Ministry of Public Work,&#13;
Transportation and Communication have organized two seminars for civil engineers, put&#13;
together a compilation of relevant documents and established a thematic committee with&#13;
the support of the World Health Organization (WHO) and USAID.To support this effort,&#13;
the building norms thematic committee, in close collaboration with the Ministry of Public&#13;
Works, Transport and Communication, will develop a set of building standards for Haiti,&#13;
taking into account wind load and seismic activity. These standards will be usedas&#13;
guidance documents for government agencies, donors and the general public. The&#13;
committee will include Caribbean engineers andprofessionals to develop these technical&#13;
documents.&#13;
The main issues that the initiative will take into account include: (i)    the recognition that&#13;
most buildingsare not built by engineers, (ii) legal responsibilities are divided among&#13;
                                                   the&#13;
several ministries, and (iii) there i s no legal liability or sentence for no compliance. To&#13;
deal with these issues, the initiative will have four deliverables:&#13;
        (a) drafting of buildingstandards for use in all engineered buildings. This&#13;
            document would be a Haitian Application Document (HAD) based on a&#13;
            comprehensive, readily-available set of standards. The ICodes of the&#13;
            InternationalCode Council (ICC) would put Hai'ti inline with most Caribbean&#13;
            countries and the common standards would further help to integrate Haitias a&#13;
            full member of Caribbean Community andCommon Market (CARICOM) and&#13;
            the Caribbean Single Market andEconomy (CSME);&#13;
        (b) standardsfor one- and two-storey, single-family dwellings of less than 250&#13;
            m2.This document would be prescriptive, consistent with the above building&#13;
            standards but necessarily more limited and oriented to the use o f non-&#13;
            engineers, buildingtechnicians, builders and professionals;&#13;
        (c) self-help residential standards that are limitedto single-storey, single-family&#13;
            dwellings e75 m2.This document would be graphic, prescriptive, and&#13;
            consistent with the above buildingand residential standards but necessarily&#13;
            more limitedthan the residential standards. Persons without formal training&#13;
            would be able to use them, especially persons buildingtheir own homes with&#13;
            the assistance of friends and neighbors;&#13;
        (d) a strategy for the dissemination and use of the standards and enforcement. It&#13;
            i s foreseen that activity (c) and (d) will require additional financing.&#13;
&#13;
The environmental assessment study for natural disaster vulnerability aims to link&#13;
support for disaster management and recovery to the broader aspect of water resources&#13;
management, considering that flood i s the greatest natural hazard of Haiti. The study will&#13;
focus inparticular on the following aspects: (a) an assessment of the intensity, impact,&#13;
frequency and causes of floods inHaiti; (b) an evaluation of existing flood management&#13;
infrastructure and institutions; (c) the preparation of an action plan for infrastructure&#13;
investments and watershed management such as reforestation and soil erosion control;&#13;
and (d) a definition of policies and institutions to promote the sustainability of proposed&#13;
investments, including financial sustainability. The land use planning committee and the&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development will be the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 24&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
implementing agencies and an internationalconsultant will be hired to provide technical&#13;
assistance, and draft the final report and an action plan.&#13;
&#13;
Rehabilitation of the Emergency Operation Center of the DPC (US$408,000 equivalent):&#13;
The project will finance the retrofitting of the DPC headquarter into an EOC, and a&#13;
training and documentation center. To coordinate the operations at the local level, the&#13;
project will also support the rehabilitationof regional emergency centers and satellite&#13;
warehouses for emergency staff and equipment. The project will finance the design,&#13;
construction, and supervision of works, as well as the conception of a national&#13;
communication system to coordinate disaster management operations between the&#13;
national and departmental levels.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement of Equipment (US$670,800 equivalent): The project will finance the&#13;
purchase of emergency equipment for the national and regional emergency operations&#13;
centers, including: power generators; communications equipment (a fixed station,&#13;
portable radios, repeaters, installation and training) and; 11vehicles (one for each&#13;
departmental EOCs and one for the national). The purchase of vehicles will be&#13;
conditional to the appointment of DPC staff inthe various departments.&#13;
&#13;
Strengthening Manayement Systems within DPC (US$159,000 equivalent): To support&#13;
the transformation of the DPC into a General Directorate with greater administrative&#13;
autonomy, the project will strengthen both its administrative and financial management&#13;
capacities and provide resources to develop a computerized inventory system. The&#13;
project will also assist DPC inthe establishment of a financial management system that&#13;
will enable it to manage both its internalresources and project related resources. This will&#13;
involve the: hiringof a consultant to develop a financial management manual (including&#13;
internal control mechanisms); purchasing of a financial management software; and&#13;
training of DPC staff involved in accounting and procurement. Indeveloping a DPC&#13;
accounting system, it i s necessary to consider the public sector accounting rules to ensure&#13;
its mainstreamingand sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
The project will provide technical assistance through the financing o f (i)  a national&#13;
consultant to establish emergency funds within the national or ministerial budgets; and&#13;
(ii)nationalconsultanttodevelopemergencyfundmanagementprotocolsandregional&#13;
    a&#13;
mutual aid agreement propositions. The DPC and the SPGRD will also have the funds to&#13;
strengthen their planning capacities by developing: (i)  a mid-term institutional&#13;
development plan, and (ii) inventory o f the risk and disaster management scope and&#13;
                              an&#13;
activities of all the ministries and agencies.&#13;
&#13;
To reinforce and standardize the administrative management system, the DPC and&#13;
SPGRD will offer budgeting, procurement, project management, document management,&#13;
and conflict management training to their staff.&#13;
&#13;
Support for Pro-iectImplementation (US$1,000,200 equivalent): The project will finance&#13;
a Project Manager, Procurement Specialist, a Financial Specialist for a total of four years&#13;
and a driver for the first year. The TOR o f this additional staff will include building&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               25&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
capacity of DPC staff in the areas of project management, procurement, and financial&#13;
management to ensure that the capacity remains inDPC. The project will also finance&#13;
the annual financial audits required.&#13;
&#13;
Component 3: LocalRisk Management (US$5,500,000 equivalent)&#13;
&#13;
Most activities under this component will be implemented under Community-Driven&#13;
Development CDD approach, already usedon a pilot basis intwo Bank-supported pilot&#13;
activities in Haiti (CDD Pilot Project inHaiti- TF051116; and LICUS for Labor&#13;
Intensive Basic Infrastructure Rehabilitation Pilot Project -TF053366). The project will&#13;
finance the creation, strengthening, and integration of local civil protectioncommittees in&#13;
highriskregions of Haiti. Some 50 committees exist inone form or another inthe 133&#13;
communes in Haiti. The project will assist the creation of new committees andor the&#13;
strengthening of existing ones to support the designand implementation of vulnerability&#13;
reduction activities at the local level. These committees will work incoordination with&#13;
community councils (with the assistanceof DPC representatives inthe departments) to&#13;
first prepare local risk and vulnerability maps and identify possible risk reduction&#13;
activities (early warning systems, retention walls, terracing, drainage works, pilot&#13;
reforestationprojects, shelter retrofitting, etc.). These activities will then be presented to&#13;
a regional committee for financing. Some 70 local committees are expected to be created&#13;
or reactivated, 50 percent of which would be inurban or peri-urban areas.&#13;
&#13;
This program will be contracted to a number of well regarded NGOs, according to&#13;
common criteria agreed upon between IDA and the DPC including experience in&#13;
community driven activities; previous expertise inrisk mitigation activities; technical and&#13;
financial capacities; and an established presence inthe region o f activity. A national-&#13;
level Government agency (PL 480 Management Office) will coordinate the contracting&#13;
and administrative monitoring of these activities with the DPC involved in strategy&#13;
formulation and supervision.&#13;
&#13;
Within a chosen territory, the selected NGOs will form the above mentioned disaster&#13;
committees, assist them in identifying and mapping risks, as well as expand and&#13;
implement risk prevention or reduction projects. Project proposals above a specified&#13;
threshold will be presented to, and approved by, a commission made of representatives&#13;
from the various disaster committees of a specific region. When projects are selected,&#13;
depending on the size and type of the project and local capacities, the local committee&#13;
will either receive fundingdirectly or contracts will be issued directly by the PL480for&#13;
implementation of the works. The NGOs will also form local groups to perform social&#13;
audits to ensure that the community grants are usedfor their intended purposes,&#13;
facilitating activity transparency and accountability at all levels.&#13;

&#13;
Institutional and Technical Support. The project will support the DPC and the SPGRD in&#13;
the implementationof the National Plan for Risk and Disaster Management (PNGRD),&#13;
including (i) provision of institutional and technical support for the creation of a&#13;
              the&#13;
training and documentation center; o f risk management units within key ministries; and&#13;
of three thematic committees under the SPGRD including public awareness, building&#13;
norms, and land use planning; (ii) revision and validation of the National Response&#13;
                                     the&#13;
Plan and the development of related emergency procedures and protocols; (iii)   the&#13;
creation, training and equippingof disaster assessment and disaster intervention teams,&#13;
within DPC and key ministries; and (iv) the realization of simulation exercises at local&#13;
and regional scale.&#13;
&#13;
Technical Studies. The establishment of the SPGRDthematic committees will lead to the&#13;
implementation of three main technical studies. First, the public awareness thematic&#13;
committee will supervise the design and implementation of a public awareness program&#13;
for the general public and decision makers to explain disaster management efforts to a&#13;
larger audience. Second, the buildingnorms thematic committee will coordinate&#13;
technical studies and workshops to support the establishment of buildingnorms that take&#13;
natural hazards into account. The initiative will be implemented inclose collaboration&#13;
with the Ministry o f Public Works and will aim at establishing norms from the&#13;
construction of public buildingsand donor funded projects. Finally, the project will&#13;
finance an environmental assessment study for natural disaster vulnerability, envisioned&#13;
to connect the efforts of natural resource management to those o f planning and risk&#13;
reduction. This study will be implemented incoordination with the land use planning&#13;
committee and inclose collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources&#13;
and Rural Development.&#13;
&#13;
Rehabilitation of the Emergency Operation Center (EOC) of the DPC. To enable the&#13;
efficient functioning of the DPC and SPGRD in times of crisis, the project will assist the&#13;
retrofitting of the national Emergency Operations Center and the purchase of the&#13;
necessary equipment to make it operational. The project will also support the retrofitting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               30&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
of regional EOCs ineach department as well as the installation of a national&#13;
communication system to coordinate operations between the national and departmental&#13;
levels.&#13;
&#13;
Strengthening Management Systems within DPC. To better fulfill its functions, the DPC&#13;
i s to become a General Directorate within this calendar year. The project will strengthen&#13;
the DPC with a new accounting system to monitor the funds it disburses and an updated&#13;
inventory system to track its resources. The project will also reinforce management,&#13;
administrative and technical capacity within the DPC and the SPGRD by trainingits staff&#13;
at the national and departmental levels. Finally, the DPC's planning capacity will be&#13;
strengthened b y supporting institutional development plans. Inconjunction to the UNDP&#13;
effort to define the legal structure of the DPC, the project will also support the&#13;
establishment of emergency funding procedures.&#13;
&#13;
Component 3 - Local Risk Management (US$5.5 million)&#13;
&#13;
Almost 50 percent of the project funds will be used for development and mitigation&#13;
activities at the local level inareas of highvulnerability to natural disasters. This&#13;
component will help DPC create or reactivate local emergency committees and train them&#13;
inrisk and disaster management. These committees, incoordination with community&#13;
councils, will prepare local risk and vulnerability maps and identify risk reduction&#13;
activities (early warning systems, retention walls, terracing, drainage works, pilot-&#13;
reforestation projects, shelter retrofitting, etc.) that the project will finance. Some 70&#13;
local committees are expected to be created or reactivated, 50 percent of which will be in&#13;
urbanor peri-urban areas. Most activities under this component will be implemented&#13;
usingCommunity DrivenDevelopment (CDD), which i s already being used on a pilot&#13;
basis intwo Bank-supportedactivities inHaiti (CDD Pilot Project in Haiti - TF051116;&#13;
and LICUS for Labor Intensive Basic Infrastructure Rehabilitation Pilot Project -&#13;
TF053366). A national-level Government agency (PL 480 Management Office) will&#13;
coordinate the efforts on behalf of the DPC with the DPC directly involved in strategy&#13;
formulation and supervision. Several NGOs selected according to shared criteria between&#13;
IDA and the DPCwill be responsible for implementation at the local level.&#13;
&#13;
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard&#13;
analysis:&#13;
&#13;
The project will have impacts at national level through institutional and policy&#13;
improvements. Inthe regions of Belle-Anse and Fonds Verrettes and the recently&#13;
affected ones where Component Iwill be implementedreconstruction works will be&#13;
undertakenreconstructionand mitigation works will be undertaken. Component IV will&#13;
finance disaster mitigation works in at least 70 communes throughout the country.&#13;
&#13;
Haiti lies in a hurricane belt and i s subject to severe storms from June to October. The&#13;
effects of tropical storms and hurricanes include wind damage, flooding, landslides and&#13;
coastal surges. Geological faults also make Haiti vulnerable to earthquakes.&#13;

Comments:&#13;
There are no major environmental or social issues identified. The classification of the&#13;
project i s Category B due to potential adverse environmental impacts on human&#13;
populations or environmentally important areas. At the same time, the environmental&#13;
impacts o f reconstruction and mitigation works to community infrastructure are likely to&#13;
be beneficial and to reduce environmental risk.&#13;
&#13;
The project is being processedunderOP 8.50 (Emergency Recovery Assistance).&#13;
Consistent with article 13 of OP4.01 the project be exempt from producing a EA report&#13;

Section I1 K e y Safeguard Issues and Their Management&#13;
           -&#13;
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues.&#13;
D.1.Describe any safeguard issuesandimpacts associatedwith the proposed project.&#13;
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.&#13;
&#13;
B y its nature, the project will have a positive social impact since i s expected to strengthen&#13;
the national structure for emergency response and disaster management. This goal will&#13;
be accomplishedby identifying hazard vulnerabilities and risks throughout the country,&#13;
developing community level awareness and executing small disaster mitigation works to&#13;
avoid natural disasters.&#13;
&#13;
The environmental issues will be specific to local areas since this emergency project's&#13;
component 3 will focus on Local Risk Management helping DPC to create local&#13;
emergency committees and train them inrisk management together with some small&#13;
disaster mitigation works. Construction of new infrastructure will be limitedto projects&#13;
that are necessary for rapid economic and social recovery. Any major new infrastructure&#13;
needs would be left for consideration beyond this project. The small disaster mitigation&#13;
works implemented under this project will have their environmental impact assessed&#13;
according to usualprocedures (screening and assessments) for community-based&#13;
development projects as well as screening for cultural property.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipatedfuture&#13;
activities inthe project area.&#13;
&#13;
With the possible exception of rehabilitationworks inthe regions of Belle-Anse, Fonds&#13;
Verrettes and other regions affected by adverse natural events, indirect or long-term&#13;
impacts will be minimal.&#13;
&#13;
D.3.Describethe treatment of alternatives (ifrelevant)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
D.4. Describe measures taken by the recipient to address safeguard issues. Provide an&#13;
assessment of recipient capacity to plan and implement the measures described.&#13;
                                                                                                 I&#13;
Local capacities for environmental assessment are very limited. The project will&#13;
therefore strengthen local authorities and to them develop and implement some&#13;
environmental guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
D.5.Identify the key stakeholders anddescribe the mechanisms for consultation and&#13;
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.&#13;

            Haiti - Emergency Recovery and Disaster
            Management Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Emergency Recovery
            and Disaster Management Project is: (a) to support the
            rehabilitation of the areas affected by the recent adverse
            natural disasters; (b) to strengthen the country's
            capacity to manage natural disaster risks and better respond
            to emergencies resulting from adverse natural events; and
            (c) to reduce the vulnerability of communities through risk
            identification and risk mitigation activities. These
            objectives are consistent with one of the focal points of
            the Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) that outlines
            IDA'S strategy for Haiti over the next 24 months (FY05
            and FY06). The TSS explicitly incorporates the activities
            already submitted to the LICUS Trust Fund, including the
            proposed disaster reconstruction and mitigation initiatives.
            The TSS, being presented to the Board together with this
            proposed operation, also includes in the lending program the
            proposed Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management Project
            for US$12 million equivalent. The objectives are also
            consistent with the overall priorities on environmental
            management within the Interim Cooperation Framework (ICF).
            The longer term objectives of the Environment Thematic
            Group, in which IDA is an active participant, include the
            development of sustainable strategies to reverse resource
            degradation by introducing sustainable watershed management,
            reforestation and measures to reduce the impact of climatic hazards.
