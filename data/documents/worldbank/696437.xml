INTEGRATED HEALTH SERVICES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:            Republic of C6te d'Ivoire (RCI)&#13;
Implementing Agency: Ministry of Public Health (MSP)&#13;
Beneficiaries:       Users of health services, particularly among the relatively less&#13;
well off and presently under-served populations&#13;
Poverty Category:    The Project is part of the program of targeted interventions.&#13;
Without being exclusively targeted towards the poor, the&#13;
Project represents an operational, health systems-oriented&#13;
approach to a poverty-conscious health services strategy.&#13;
Credit Amount:       SDR 27.7 million (US$40 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms:               Standard, with 40 years maturity&#13;
Project Objectives.    The objectives of the proposed Integrated Health Services&#13;
Development Project, within the framework of the&#13;
Government's National Health Development Plan, are to (a)&#13;
expand access to health services and improve their utilization;&#13;
(b) make health services available on a sustainable basis; and&#13;
(c) improve the ability of the MSP to analyze health problems,&#13;
and to formulate, monitor and evaluate policies, strategies and&#13;
programs. The Project would seek to establish the foundation&#13;
for universal availability of cost-effective, technically and&#13;
culturally appropriate health services that are affordable and&#13;
sustainable to the people and country as a whole, by expanding&#13;
service delivery for a minimum package of health care and&#13;
reproductive health services, and by expanding MSP capacity&#13;
at the headquarters level.&#13;
Project Description.   The Project consists of a three-year set of priority Government&#13;
programs in four main areas: (a) the minimum package of&#13;
health services (PMA); (b) reproductive health; (c) health&#13;
planning and management; and (d) information and health.&#13;
Service delivery (components (a) and (b)) includes: (i)&#13;
investment and start-up costs for PMA introduction in about&#13;
fourteen districts, including nutrition, pharmaceuticals,&#13;
training, reproductive health, and IEC services; and (ii) an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ii&#13;
accelerated program of reproductive health services, including&#13;
family planning and sexually transmitted diseases (such as&#13;
HIV/AIDS), through specialized public sector and NGO clinics&#13;
and the addition of family planning services to non-specialized&#13;
public sector health clinics. Institutional strengthening&#13;
activities (components (c) and (d)) cover the following areas:&#13;
(i) organization development of the MSP; (ii) information&#13;
systems (MIS), including epidemiological surveillance (such as&#13;
onchocerciasis) and continuous monitoring and feedback of&#13;
user perspectives on services; (iii) training of prescribers in use&#13;
of generic drugs and strengthening of quality control&#13;
laboratory services; (iv) health care financing (including&#13;
mutual insurance and complementary private insurance); (v)&#13;
financial management; and (vi) review of training programs&#13;
and strengthening of personnel management in further pursuit&#13;
of actions started under the HRMP.&#13;
Financing Plan.       See para. 4.22.&#13;
Project Benefits.     The Project will contribute to long-term  improvements in&#13;
health outcomes, particularly reduced fertility, improved child&#13;
health, and a relatively reduced burden from sexually&#13;
transmitted and other diseases.  The other benefits of the&#13;
Project will be institutional: strengthened MSP capacity and&#13;
strengthened service delivery, and expansion of the focus of&#13;
health policy makers beyond traditional curative care to&#13;
preventive services, reproductive health and - to some extent -&#13;
nutrition. Work undertaken for WDR93, BHA, and other&#13;
country-specific studies in Africa clearly demonstrate that the&#13;
proposed approach - provision of a minimum package of health&#13;
services by community-supported health centers, first referral&#13;
hospitals, and health districts - is the least cost method to&#13;
achieve substantial and sustainable health gains.&#13;
Project Risks.        The  main  non-quantifiable  risks  concern:  (a)  limited&#13;
commitment to universally accessible, cost-effective PHN&#13;
interventions that are feasible and sustainable, including&#13;
particularly reproductive health, with the associated risk of&#13;
political interference; (b) the resistance to change generated by&#13;
substantial past investments in facilities and human resources&#13;
oriented towards health services models, and a centralized&#13;
public sector management culture, that are inconsistent with&#13;
the social and economic realities and needs of the country; and&#13;
(c) limited MSP and NGO capacity, both centrally and at the&#13;
periphery, to execute government and donor-financed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
iii&#13;
programs. These risks are being mitigated by institutionalizing&#13;
regular beneficiary assessments, the recently completed&#13;
institutional assessment of MSP and the follow-up organization&#13;
development program, locating overall responsibility for the&#13;
Project in the Minister's Cabinet, building institutional support&#13;
for health services provided by community associations, local&#13;
authorities, and NGOs into the Project, and limiting Project&#13;
external financing to four years. Government ownership of the&#13;
Project both outside and within the MSP needs, nonetheless, to&#13;
be increased. A Project launch workshop will be held to that&#13;
end, IEC activities are planned, allocations of staff time for&#13;
supervision are planned commensurate to the task, and trust&#13;
fund support for supervision work is being pre-programmed.&#13;
The main risks that have been quantified concern an increase in&#13;
the cost of the PMA, a decline in Government financial support&#13;
to health, and the impact of reduced economic growth. A 50&#13;
percent increase in the cost of the PMA, either by under-&#13;
estimation of present costs or by expansion of the range of&#13;
services provided, would increase MSP expenditures on&#13;
universal coverage of health services by about two-thirds; this&#13;
shows the importance of attention to cost containment as Cote&#13;
d'Ivoire pursues the goal of universal access to health care.&#13;
Financing the PMA with GDP growth at 50 percent of the rate&#13;
projected by the Bank, and with a 50 percent decline in the&#13;
share of Government expenditures devoted to health would&#13;
require an increase of one-third in the health share of&#13;
household expenditures from its current level of 4.5 percent, to&#13;
6.0 percent. While conceivable, such a shift would require a&#13;
major communications effort which a Government not giving&#13;
priority to health would undoubtedly have difficulty making.&#13;
Financing universal PMA coverage with a reduction of&#13;
economic growth by 50 percent but keeping the current MSP&#13;
share in Government expenditures is projected to be feasible, if&#13;
necessary. The Government's MSP budget projections through&#13;
1999 are consistent with the growth path that would be needed&#13;
to achieve universal coverage under the PMA program in ten&#13;
years.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF COTE D'IVOIRE&#13;
INTEGRATED HEALTH SERVICES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
1. MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT AND COUNTRY&#13;
ASSISTANCE STRATEGY&#13;
1.1   During the period 1980-93, the Government relied exclusively on internal&#13;
adjustment measures to redress large fiscal and current account imbalances as well as the&#13;
structural factors constraining dynamic private sector development and growth.&#13;
However, this strategy failed to reverse the economic decline, which was particularly&#13;
evident in the private sector. Against this background, the Government adopted a&#13;
medium-term economic framework (MTF) in the early 1 990s which recognized the need&#13;
to restore international competitiveness. But the actions carried out under the MTF were&#13;
insufficient to reduce the overvaluation of the CFA franc and reverse the recession which&#13;
actually deepened in 1993.&#13;
1.2   The 50 percent devaluation in January  1994 was accompanied by a&#13;
comprehensive stabilization and structural adjustment program.   It has shown&#13;
encouraging results during the last two years. Inflation was brought under control within&#13;
months following the parity change, yielding a change in the price index of 32.5 percent&#13;
in 1994 and about 8 percent during 1995. The reduction of inflation was largely&#13;
accomplished through a restrictive wage policy, by increasing nominal public sector&#13;
wages less than inflation. As a result, the Government wage bill has fallen from about&#13;
10.7 percent of GDP in 1993 to 7.9 percent in 1994 and to 6.9 percent in 1995. A&#13;
similar, although less restrictive, policy stance was adopted by the private sector.&#13;
1.3   Fiscal policy continues to be the cornerstone of the stabilization program. The&#13;
Government met its revenue and expenditure targets in 1994 and 1995, thereby&#13;
generating primary balance surpluses in the order of 1.6 and 3.2 percent of GDP&#13;
respectively. While the reduction of many taxes (VAT, petroleum taxes, and import&#13;
tariffs) in early 1994 helped dampen inflationary pressures, it reduced revenue as a share&#13;
of GDP and required compensatory measures in the form of reintroducing export taxes&#13;
on coffee and cocoa. However, the Government has since reduced the export tax on&#13;
these commodities, and it is expected that their importance within overall government&#13;
revenue will fall from about 27 percent in 1994-95 to less than 20 percent by the end of&#13;
1996.&#13;
1.4   With the successful stabilization effort, the Government has also deepened its&#13;
structural adjustment program. Since the devaluation, the Government has implemented&#13;
key components of its trade reforms, including a simplification and reduction of import&#13;
tariffs as well as the elimination of a series of non-tariff barriers. Moreover, the&#13;
Government has begun a far-reaching liberalization process in rice and maritime&#13;
transport and shown its determination to confront vested interest groups in order to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
reduce transaction costs, thereby further increasing the competitiveness of the Ivorian&#13;
economy. Other areas of progress include the acceleration of the privatization program,&#13;
and the adoption of the new labor code and the new investment code.&#13;
1.5   Bank Group Assistance Strategv. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was&#13;
prepared following the devaluation and discussed by the Board in June 1994. The CAS&#13;
supports the Government's objectives of increasing real GDP growth and strengthening&#13;
external and internal competitiveness, as formulated in the 1994 PFP and its updates in&#13;
1995 and 19962. Major CAS priorities are to help the Government:  (i) maintain&#13;
macroeconomic stability and strengthen public sector finances through reforms in both&#13;
revenue and expenditure; (ii) promote private sector development through continued&#13;
liberalization of trade, financial and labor markets, and through investments in&#13;
agriculture, industry, and transport; (iii) increase the effectiveness of the human&#13;
resources development program through increased focus on primary health care, AIDS,&#13;
basic education, and population policy; (iv) strengthen institutional capacity through&#13;
existing IDA-supported technical assistance programs; and (v) intensify environmental&#13;
work through projects and the National Environment Action Plan (NEAP) process. This&#13;
strategy is being implemented as programmed. A CAS progress report has been&#13;
circulated to the Board under separate cover.&#13;
1.6   The CAS identifies the resolution of the country's substantial public financing&#13;
requirements, including heavy debt service obligations, as a critical factor in determining&#13;
C6te d'Ivoire's economic prospects. The CAS envisages that the World Bank would&#13;
help finance the Government budget through a series of fast-disbursing operations. The&#13;
recently approved PSD Credit is an important element in this financing scenario.&#13;
1.7  In the area of social sector development, the Bank strategy notes that there are&#13;
three major disparities in access to health care in Cote d'lvoire, by region, by income&#13;
level and by gender. The historic concentration of services on curative action in the&#13;
capital city and the neglect of such services as family planning and nutrition have&#13;
accentuated these disparities. The less well-off population groups tend to use health&#13;
services less than others. Since around 60 percent of medical consultations among the&#13;
lowest two expenditures quintiles were at public sector health centers in 1995, and about&#13;
50 percent of consultations amnong the two highest quintiles were at public sector&#13;
hospitals, a program, such as the minimum package (PMA), concentrated on&#13;
strengthening services at health centers will benefit the poor relatively more than the rich.&#13;
1.8   MIGA. Cote d'Ivoire has been a member of MIGA only since 1988. MIGA has&#13;
received nine preliminary applications for investments in the areas of oil and gas,&#13;
manufacturing and financial services. The potential investors are from Canada, France,&#13;
Switzerland and the United States, and planned investments total about US$170 million.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

1.9   IFC has maintained a long-standing relationship with Cote d'Ivoire. It is fairly&#13;
optimistic about the country's economic prospects and continues to develop a solid&#13;
pipeline of projects in the coming years provided the Government stays the course on the&#13;
reform program. This positive stance is reflected in the exceptionally high level of&#13;
approvals for C6te d'Ivoire during the past two years--US$96 million. IFC's total&#13;
portfolio held, as of April 1996, was US$156.4 million, about 46 percent of which were&#13;
loan investments, and total disbursed portfolio was US$149.7 million. The pipeline&#13;
includes six projects in the agro-industry, tourism and financial sectors, of which two are&#13;
through the Africa Enterprise Fund (AEF). The Africa Project Development Facility&#13;
(APDF) is also active, with four projects in its pipeline.&#13;
2. HEALTH AND THE HEALTH SECTOR&#13;
A. HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT&#13;
2.1    Cote d'Ivoire has traditionally given high priority to human resources in its public&#13;
expenditures but has not had health achievements consistent with this priority.&#13;
Corrective efforts were initiated in the early 1990s and will be accelerated under the&#13;
proposed Project. More than 50 percent of budget outlays were consistently devoted to&#13;
human resources in the 1981-91 period. By the late 1980s the deteriorating economic&#13;
situation and inappropriate human resources policies led the country to have social&#13;
indicators generally worse than those for countries with lower average per capita income&#13;
levels and which spent significantly less on health and education.&#13;

2.2    C6te d'Ivoire spends more than most African countries on health as a share of&#13;
GDP and in per capita terms. Nevertheless, health outcomes in Cote d'Ivoire are worse&#13;
than those in comparable countries (Table 1). The infant mortality rate of 94 is higher&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
than the average of 70 for developing countries, and the maternal mortality rate estimated&#13;
at 1,000 per 100,000 live births in 1988 is among the highest in Africa. Likewise, the&#13;
fertility rate of 6.6 for 1992 is higher than for any other West African country and is&#13;
higher than the average for all of Sub-Saharan Africa.&#13;
2.3    As the economy expanded, C6te d'Ivoire invested heavily in the health sector in&#13;
the 1960s and 1970s, especially in health infrastructure. As a result, it now has 1400&#13;
public sector facilities, including four university hospitals, eight regional and general&#13;
hospitals, 29 bases de sante rurale, 340 maternities, and 700 dispensaries. Private sector&#13;
facilities include 30 clinics, 60 physician cabinets, 310 private pharmacies and 400&#13;
affiliated subsidiary djp6ts pharmaceutiques. Health care personnel include over 1,400&#13;
doctors (of which 200 in the private sector), 380 pharmacists (320 in the private sector),&#13;
over 5,000 nurses (400 in the private sector), and over 2,000 nurse-midwives. The&#13;
country's doctor per inhabitant ratio, 1/10,000, is much higher than in Sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa, as a whole, 1/24,000.&#13;
2.4   During the period 1981-88, as the economy faced increasing pressure, public&#13;
expenditure on health grew at an annual rate of 3.3 percent, somewhat below the&#13;
population growth rate. In addition, the structure of public expenditures on health was&#13;
distorted in three ways:&#13;
3  First, too much was spent on curative care relative to preventive care.&#13;
Curative care is generally both expensive and a private good, while&#13;
preventive care generates many positive externalities, is much less expensive&#13;
and is usually more cost-effective, even though private demand is generally&#13;
low for preventive care.&#13;
*   Second, too much was spent on salaries relative to non-salary recurrent&#13;
expenditure. The personnel share of recurrent expenditures grew from 67&#13;
percent in 1981 to over 75 percent in 1984.&#13;
*  Third, the share of medicines in recurrent public health expenditure declined&#13;
continuously between 1981 and 1987.&#13;
2.5   In the 1980s, the structure of health personnel in Cote d'Ivoire was distorted by&#13;
inappropriate staff ratios and competency profiles: The structure was top-heavy, with&#13;
low and deteriorating nurse-to-doctor ratios. The capacity of the MSP to plan, program&#13;
and monitor health activities was weak, reflecting the lack of trained personnel as well as&#13;
poor technical and financial information systems.&#13;
2.6   Most curative health services were located in urban centers, and therefore were&#13;
out of reach of the vast majority of the population. Also, it appeared that the population&#13;
did not expect benefits from consulting the existing curative services because the&#13;
perceived quality of the service provided was poor. As a result of these factors,&#13;
consultation rates for curative health services were very low.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
2.7   Government health policies began to change in the early 1990s. The Human&#13;
Resources Development Program (HRDP, 1991-1994) was intended by the Government&#13;
to reverse the unfavorable trends in human resources development which threatened to&#13;
compromise the country's efforts for human development. The Memorandum of the&#13;
President on the operation articulated the principal goal as "increasing the quality of&#13;
service delivery, while broadening the coverage at the primary levels in education and&#13;
health and offering more demand-driven training opportunities". The envisioned goals&#13;
required basic changes in the Ivorian civil service that failed to be fully institutionalized,&#13;
not to mention internalized among the staff. These goals could hardly be achieved in one&#13;
adjustment operation, since they represent the development task of a generation or more.&#13;
2.8   Despite its over-ambitious character, under the HRDP the Government made&#13;
progress on a series of health issues, including pharmaceuticals, the first elements of a&#13;
strategy based on primary care, decentralization and region-level management, and cost&#13;
recovery. Cost recovery was an important achievement: Since October 1994, public&#13;
sector primary care facilities have been allowed fully to recover the cost of medicines&#13;
and the non-salary cost of curative medical interventions. In rural areas, health facilities&#13;
retain 90 percent of these revenues, and in urban areas 65 percent, in blocked accounts at&#13;
the local level to replenish drugs used in public sector facilities, and for locally&#13;
determined operating and maintenance costs.&#13;
B. HEALTH SECTOR FINANCING&#13;
2.9   In 1990, health expenditures in Cote d'Ivoire had about half of their sources in&#13;
the public sector and half in the private sector3. More recent household survey data&#13;
suggest that as much as 60 percent of health spending, or even more, may be private.&#13;
However, much more is known about public spending than about private spending.&#13;
Public spending on health was one of the major focal points of the HRDP. The&#13;
Implementation Completion Report on the HRDP found continuing distortions in the&#13;
allocations of government budgetary resources between primary and preventive health&#13;
services functions and tertiary services functions.4&#13;
2.10 In 1994, the European Commission carried out a major review of public&#13;
expenditures (EU PER) in the health sector. The World Bank and other donors joined in&#13;
financing the study.5 The study found: (a) a twenty-five percent decline, from 1992 to&#13;
1995 in real per capita recurrent budget allocations, with a need for about 7 billion in&#13;
CFA francs to catch up; (b) a lack of expenditure information at the MSP, which makes&#13;
it difficult for the MSP to monitor payments and be held accountable for payments to&#13;
suppliers it selects; (c) a need to strengthen budget procedures and analyses at the MSP;&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
(d) rising cost recovery receipts, with a need to ensure that they do not lead to reduction&#13;
in public budget allocations for health; (e) a need to strengthen human resource planning,&#13;
and to take action to respond with creative support for private assignments as an&#13;
alternative to the emerging unemployment of medical graduates who cannot be absorbed&#13;
by the public sector; and (f) a need to update norms for spending and health inputs&#13;
established for the HRDP, and to use them for monitoring. Pursuit of the agenda of&#13;
issues from the HRDP and the public expenditure review will continue under the&#13;
proposed Project and the Government's sectoral program.  The Government is&#13;
determined to exploit the recommendations of the study, and the proposed Project&#13;
provides funds for this.&#13;
2.11  The MSP Budget.  Starting with the HRDP and then in connection with&#13;
successive Policy Framework Papers and the preparation of the proposed Project, the&#13;
Ivorian authorities and the Bank have had frequent discussions on the MSP budget. With&#13;
the Bank's encouragement, in 1994 and 1996 supplemental budget allocations were made&#13;
for health services, largely at the primary care level. During negotiations assurances&#13;
were obtained that, by October 1 of each year, annual consultations will be held on MSP&#13;
budget plans in respect of the forthcoming calendar year, and on execution in respect of&#13;
the current calendar year; these reviews will encompass counterpart funds required for&#13;
the proposed Project and the investment and recurrent funds required for approved&#13;
district health development plans. The annual Policy Framework Paper will provide an&#13;
opportunity to review the MSP budget in its macroeconomic context.&#13;
2.12  Private spending.  Private spending on health services is much less well&#13;
understood than public spending. According to household survey data, in 1993 and 1995&#13;
it amounted to $12 and $14 per capita. These figures compare with an estimate of $17 in&#13;
19906. (Annex 16 gives further information on household survey results.) Since private&#13;
spending constitutes such a substantial share of total health expenditures, it is surprising&#13;
that so little is known about it; this is one consequence of the intellectual heritage of the&#13;
provident state and the orientation of public policy towards the supply of public sector&#13;
health services. Under its emerging strategy, the Government expects to devote more&#13;
attention than in the past to demand variables.&#13;
2.13 National health accounts. Data weaknesses and lack of analytical capacity and&#13;
determination mean that the MSP has yet to address the interactions of Government,&#13;
donor and household spending on health. However, the preparation of the proposed&#13;
Project has led officials to become increasingly aware of the problem, and an initial set&#13;
of national health accounts is to be prepared as part of the planning and management&#13;
component of the proposed Project.  The emphasis will be less on intellectual&#13;
sophistication than on providing a practical tool to the MSP, and on strengthening its&#13;
capacity to use it through training and staffing changes.&#13;

2.14 Health insurance. Publicly sponsored health insurance is provided for public&#13;
sector employees, and the private sector has the beginnings of what could become an&#13;
active private health insurance market. About 7 percent of the Ivorian population is&#13;
covered by a private voluntary health insurance program. In 1994 and 1995, a&#13;
governmental Commission on Social Security made proposals for the establishment of a&#13;
publicly sponsored mutual insurance scheme oriented towards financing of universally&#13;
available primary care. While the Commission envisaged a Government guarantee, the&#13;
Government has wisely decided that whatever scheme is ultimately established will have&#13;
to be entirely self-financing and without public guarantee. Under the proposed Project,&#13;
the Government will prepare and introduce pilot mutual insurance at the district level,&#13;
and consultant studies will examine the circumstances under which complementary&#13;
private insurance, largely for tertiary care, could be expanded; a detailed work plan for&#13;
these studies is now in preparation.&#13;
C. DONOR ASSISTANCE&#13;
1. Previous Bank Operations in the Sector and Lessons Learned&#13;
2.15 Health and Demographic Proiect: The Implementation Completion Report finds&#13;
that the principal lessons learned from this project (Ln 2619-IVC) are:&#13;
(a)   Project scope and content should be coherent and support an agreed sector&#13;
strategy and program that is based on a consensus and agreed among the different&#13;
ministries concerned;&#13;
(b)   Agreement should be reached up-front on performance indicators, and be&#13;
reviewed through Project launch workshops, annual programming exercises, and a mid-&#13;
term assessment;&#13;
(c)   Project management arrangement should be agreed, including staffing&#13;
commitments and roles of key technical units;&#13;
(d)   Bank missions should be more frequent, with skill mix tailored to the&#13;
technical and management requirement of the project; the Bank may want to consider&#13;
delegation of certain tasks to the Regional Mission; and&#13;
(e)   The Bank may want to consider a shorter time-frame for future Projects,&#13;
with phased implementation based on an agreed work program; some dovetailing of&#13;
projects will reduce staff losses and reduce the risks of financing gaps.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
2.16 Human Resources Development Program: The Implementation Completion&#13;
Report7 finds that the principal lessons learned from this adjustment operation (Ln. 3428-&#13;
IVC, and Credits 2323-0, 2323-1, and 2323-2-IVC) are:&#13;
(a)   The importance of macroeonomic/sectoral links and balance;&#13;
(b)   The extreme difficulty of operationalizing budget understandings; a good&#13;
dialogue may be more important than formal conditions;&#13;
(c)   Close linkage is required between financing and disbursement and&#13;
substantial program issues and objectives; the potential irrelevance of adjustment lending&#13;
to human resources concerns;&#13;
(d)   The importance of appropriate sequencing;&#13;
(e)   The importance of not losing sight of poverty and equity concerns, and of&#13;
keeping balance in the face of popular trends in development thinking; and&#13;
(f)   The critical importance of ownership of the operation by the borrower and&#13;
the many borrower agencies concerned.&#13;
2.17  The proposed Project reflects directly the importance of the lessons learned from&#13;
these operations, in its focus on dialogue with the technical ministry responsible for&#13;
health services, its relatively short three-year execution period, its focus on supporting an&#13;
agreed sector strategy, and the growing attention to poverty and equity concerns.&#13;
2. Other donors&#13;
2.18 The African Development Bank, the European Commission, France and Germany&#13;
are the major partners of C6te d'Ivoire in the social sectors, together with UN agencies,&#13;
such as WHO, UNFPA and UNICEF. Belgium and Canada also support programs in the&#13;
health sector, and Japan has made a substantial grant for hospital rehabilitation. USAID&#13;
was an active donor to the family planning program but has terminated its assistance to&#13;
the largest NGO (AIBEF) operating in this field. The large number of donors active in&#13;
the sector, many with a long history of involvement, complicates the coordination task of&#13;
the Government.&#13;
2.19  In 1990, total donor funding amounted to $11 million, equal to about 3 percent of&#13;
total health expenditures; in 1994, it was reported also to be 3 percent - a relatively low&#13;
figure by African standards, which estimate donor funding at nearly 20 percent of the&#13;
total in 1990. According to estimates in the HRDP Implementation Completion Report,&#13;
social priorities (including primary health and education services, and basic water and&#13;
sanitation) account for slightly less than 20 percent of donor assistance.&#13;

D. KEY ISSUES&#13;
2.20  Two central issues serve as organizing principles for reviewing health services&#13;
and programs in C6te d'Ivoire: (a) program management and decentralization, to make a&#13;
minimum package of quality health services universally available, for maximum&#13;
improvement in health outcomes; and (b) new priorities in reproductive health, nutrition,&#13;
and information, education and communication for behavior change.&#13;
1. Program Management and Decentralization: Ensuring Universal Access&#13;
to Services&#13;
2.21  As indicated above, in the years since Independence C6te d'Ivoire has developed&#13;
a substantial health infrastructure and trained large numbers of health care personnel.&#13;
However, the models of health care that have driven these developments have been&#13;
insufficiently adapted to the economic and social realities of the country. Services have&#13;
been highly disease-oriented. Neither policy nor resource allocation has focused on&#13;
overall health outcomes, nor on the difficult practical issue of providing care to all within&#13;
a reasonable period of time. The country has developed an elitist cadre of health&#13;
professionals, strongly oriented towards curative care provided by public sector hospitals&#13;
located in the urban areas, particularly Abidjan.  Relatively little attention has been&#13;
given to public health.&#13;
2.22  As in other parts of the Ivorian public sector, the attitudes of MSP staff are&#13;
highly centralized and services are under-managed. Centralization has been particularly&#13;
problematic in the field of health because of the critical importance of contact and&#13;
communication with the beneficiaries of health services. The disconnect between general&#13;
statements of policy and the realities of resource allocation and day-to-day activities&#13;
reflects the under-management of health services. Monitoring and information systems&#13;
have been given little attention, particularly at the implementation stage. Work that was&#13;
initiated on them under the Bank-financed Health and Demographic Project was delayed&#13;
and unfortunately not completed before closure of the Loan. The MSP has become&#13;
increasingly aware of these problems, and is determined to move forward with new&#13;
information systems, for epidemiological surveillance, health system planning, and&#13;
health system management. It has taken initial steps towards deconcentration of public&#13;
sector health services, with the initiative to present budget data on a regional basis; but,&#13;
meaningful decentralization to the country's health districts of financial and personnel&#13;
authority remains a lofty and largely unrealized ideal. Furthermore, decentralization&#13;
concerns not only the MSP but even more importantly the Ministry of Finance and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
Ministry of the Civil Service, for the latter ministries hold most of the effective power&#13;
over financial and personnel decisions. The information base in the MSP is weak on&#13;
financial and personnel matters. The emergence of substantial receipts from medical&#13;
consultations, starting in 1994, offers the possibility of reopening the issue of financial&#13;
information and responsibility. The first step is for the MSP to master the information&#13;
and tools that it now has available. The proposed Project will assist in this task.&#13;
2. New Priorities: Reproductive Health, Nutrition, IEC, and Partnerships&#13;
with Non-Governmental Partners&#13;
2.23  Thanks in part to the consciousness-raising impact of recent major international&#13;
conferences, such as the 1992 International Conference on Nutrition (ICN), the 1994&#13;
Cairo Conference on Population and Development, and the 1995 Beijing Conference on&#13;
Women, the Ivorian health authorities are becoming increasingly aware of the&#13;
importance of reproductive health, nutrition, and information, education and&#13;
communication programs for health-related behavior change. The evolving visions of&#13;
the role of the state, emerging internationally as well as in C6te d'Ivoire under its&#13;
structural adjustment program, have led Ivorian health policy makers also to give&#13;
increasing attention to new partnerships for better health with the Government's non-&#13;
governmental partners.&#13;
2.24  The significance of the country's 3.8 percent annual population growth rate is&#13;
beginning to penetrate the thinking and actions of policymakers, due in part to analyses&#13;
of the census data collected under the Bank-financed Health and Demographic Project.&#13;
Family planning programs have thus far only been financed by USAID and the&#13;
International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), though new assistance from&#13;
Germany is expected shortly as USAID phases out its assistance in the country. Cote&#13;
d'Ivoire has the highest reported levels of HIV seropositivity in West Africa. As in&#13;
many other countries, however, the willingness to confront a disease that is transmitted&#13;
by behavior widely viewed as socially unacceptable has been limited among opinion&#13;
leaders. The Cairo Conference led the authorities to prepare a voluminous report, and&#13;
has contributed to an atmosphere legitimizing discussion of reproductive health. The&#13;
MSP has for some years had programs of cooperation with the local affiliate of IPPF and&#13;
- more recently - with an internationally backed local private voluntary organization&#13;
which provides anonymous AIDS testing. It is now working on the preparation of a&#13;
broader program of cooperation which will include financial support to purely local&#13;
NGOs and community associations to expand health services, particularly for hard-to-&#13;
reach target populations. The most recently published surveys place protein-calorie&#13;
malnutrition at 20 percent in urban areas and 28 percent in rural zones. A National&#13;
Commission on Food and Nutrition is preparing a long-term strategy for food security, in&#13;
pursuit of the understandings reached at the ICN, but operational activity does not yet&#13;
exist and the MSP is notably weak in its human resources assigned to nutrition. IEC has&#13;
existed, as a health activity, in Cote d'Ivoire, for many years, but has been given little&#13;
priority in a highly medicalized health environment. Thus what is needed now is renewal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
and expansion, with particular focus on clarifying responsibilities, defining baseline&#13;
behavior and measuring and monitoring change.&#13;
3. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY&#13;
A. SECTOR STRATEGY REVIEW FOR THE CONSULTATIVE GROUP&#13;
3.1   Following the devaluation of the CFA franc and in preparation for the June 1995&#13;
meeting of the Consultative Group for Cote d'Ivoire, the Government undertook a major&#13;
review of its health strategies. The Government health strategy statement prepared for&#13;
the Consultative Group found that, despite improvements under the HRDP, the sector&#13;
continues to suffer from the absence of planning, weaknesses in programming and&#13;
budgeting, and the inability to manage its personnel. Budgeting was considered to be&#13;
limited in its scope, and supervision of budget execution insufficient. Norms for services&#13;
were found to be lacking, despite the importance given to this subject under the HRDP.&#13;
Poor information management made budget monitoring deficient, and bureaucratic&#13;
inertia made execution of budgets in the interior particularly difficult. Personnel are, the&#13;
statement finds, poorly motivated and poorly distributed in the country.   A&#13;
disequilibrium was noted between curative and preventive services. The Govermnent&#13;
strategy document found three major problems: (a) poor access to care; (b) inadequate&#13;
adaptation of services to the expectations of beneficiaries; and (c) the limited credibility&#13;
of modern medicine by comparison with traditional practices.&#13;
3.2   The Government's Consultative Group health strategy statement fixes the&#13;
following principal sectoral objectives: reducing morbidity and mortality (including&#13;
infant and child mortality); maternal mortality; eradication or control of infectious and&#13;
parasitic diseases, both old (malaria, TB, etc.) and new (HIV); and reduction in&#13;
nutritional weaknesses (particularly iodine and vitamin A). Additional objectives include&#13;
managing population growth at the family and national level, and improving the internal&#13;
and external efficiency of the health and social system. To achieve efficiency gains, the&#13;
Government states that it proposes to organize health care on the basis of a minimum&#13;
package of health services (PMA), to reform initial and in-service training programs, to&#13;
facilitate establishment of recent graduates in private medical practice, and to finalize the&#13;
information system initiated under the Health and Demographic Project. To consolidate&#13;
progress under the HRDP, the Government proposes to pursue rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance of health infrastructure, increase the availability of and access to essential&#13;
drugs by actions in the public and private sectors, institute a real deconcentration of&#13;
services, strengthen the economic and financial management of the health system,&#13;
promote effective community participation in the management of health services,&#13;
strengthen service quality, reinforce coverage, and create a system of health insurance.&#13;
3.3   At the Consultative Group general support was expressed for the Government's&#13;
strategy statement, and the Government was encouraged to move forward and make it&#13;
increasingly operational. Since that time the Government has been giving increasing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
attention to donor coordination in the health sector. Meetings of donors chaired by the&#13;
Minister of Public Health are held approximately every three months, and informal sub-&#13;
sectoral consultations are held as needed. In June 1996, the MSP will hold a health&#13;
sector round table meeting in Abidjan, as part of the agreed follow-up on the&#13;
Consultative Group. The Government's health policy letter (Annex 2) follows closely&#13;
the Government's planned presentation to the round table of its ten year National Health&#13;
Development Plan.&#13;
3.4   The tendency of donor funding to follow donor rather than Government priorities,&#13;
to concentrate on technical assistance, and not to be fully integrated into Government&#13;
accounting has made managing donor relations a particularly difficult task in the health&#13;
sector. The MSP has become increasingly sensitive to this problem over the past several&#13;
years, and expects to take the initiative to address it in connection with the round table.&#13;
A first step will be to establish a reasonable data base. The annual reviews of the sector&#13;
program which the MSP expects to undertaken with its financiers will help to strengthen&#13;
donor coordination. Thus, the round table should be seen as but one step in a larger and&#13;
longer process of gradual integration of donor funding into an increasingly complete&#13;
sector investment and development program. The proposed Project is a step in this&#13;
direction. Donors have been engaged in the dialogue during its preparation, and the&#13;
Government expects them gradually to join in financing a broad sectoral program with&#13;
common national service norms.&#13;
3.5   The MSP public investment program for 1995-1997 set out in the Consultative&#13;
Group document is sound in concept, but over-ambitious in level, at 90 billion CFA&#13;
francs (US$180 million). Projects in execution amount to 33 billion CFA francs, and&#13;
new projects amount to 57 billion CFA francs. Most of the new projects in the&#13;
Consultative Group paper require a substantial amount of additional preparatory work,&#13;
and the absorptive capacity of the country for a program of the size presented to the&#13;
Consultative Group needs strengthening. Despite its sound thrust, the public investment&#13;
program in the health sector requires further analytical work, to ensure consistency&#13;
between the Government's strategy, stated priorities and proposed investments, and&#13;
among the PIP, the Consultative Group document, and the government's investment&#13;
budget (the BSIE). During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the government&#13;
will review and update its three year health sector public investment program by the end&#13;
of 1996, update it annually thereafter, and execute it taking due account of IDA's&#13;
comments.&#13;
3.6   Prior to negotiations, the Government submitted a draft health policy letter to&#13;
the Association. The draft was discussed during negotiations. Previous to Board&#13;
presentation, the Government approved and submitted the signed health policy letter to&#13;
the Association. The letter (Annex 2) presents a general, long term vision of health and&#13;
health services in Cote d'Ivoire. Pursuing themes in its presentation to the Consultative&#13;
Group, the policy letter underscores the following strategies: (a) promotion of primary&#13;
care based on a minimum package of health services (PMA); (b) promotion of a multi-&#13;
sectoral approach and partnerships with actors outside the MSP; (c) improvement in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
financial and geographic access to health services; (d) improvement in management of&#13;
the health system; (e) development and optimal utilization of. health sector human&#13;
resources; and (f) promotion of research. These themes are at the core of the Project&#13;
appraised in this report and create a foundation for the evolution of the Ivorian health&#13;
system from a relatively high cost model based on public sector urban hospitals with low&#13;
access and utilization of services, to a relatively low cost system based on a minimum&#13;
package of services provided through public and non-governmental primary care health&#13;
centers and first referral hospitals that are widely accessible and used because they are&#13;
responsive to the expectations of beneficiaries.&#13;
B. MANAGING CHANGE: THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM OF ACTION RESEARCH,&#13;
STUDIES, TRAINING AND PILOT PROJECTS&#13;
3.7   Following a strategic management retreat in November 1994, the MSP began, in&#13;
February 1995, to establish an overall program of action research, studies, training and&#13;
pilot projects. This program aims to prepare the Ministry for the future, and to pave the&#13;
way for future financing decisions; thus it has been called a Programme Preparatoire au&#13;
Financement by MSP staff. Many of these activities existed previously, but they had not&#13;
been brought together and subjected to review or support. A Coordinator has been&#13;
designated in the Minister's Cabinet, and the various departments and services have&#13;
submitted action research, study, training and pilot project proposals for review and&#13;
integration into a coherent whole. A planning and programming tool for the Ministry has&#13;
emerged. It is expected, over time, to aid in planning and determination of priorities, and&#13;
to facilitate knowledge-based decision-making.&#13;
3.8   The action research and studies program represents the foundation for the&#13;
institutional development components of the proposed Project. Overall, it will help the&#13;
MSP to manage change proactively, and contribute to the formulation and execution of a&#13;
fully integrated sectoral program. Thus, the MSP will be able to cease responding&#13;
passively to externally driven initiatives and disabling environmental factors and take the&#13;
initiative for change. The total cost of the action research and studies program is&#13;
estimated at over $4 million. Its financing includes funding from the Bank's PPF&#13;
advance, an equivalent Japanese grant, the IDA Credit recommended in this report, and&#13;
possible support from the European Commission and other donors. Initial experience&#13;
with the program has given the senior management of the MSP new insights into the&#13;
strengths and weaknesses of the staff, and has made the need for methodological&#13;
guidance to local researchers clear. Thus, before the end of 1996, the MSP will appoint a&#13;
Sous-Directeur of Applied Research. If delays hamper the program during Project&#13;
execution, the MSP will recruit a research administrator. Furthermore, over time the&#13;
Ministry will increasingly use the action research program proactively to manage&#13;
research and study proposals with substantial policy implications, while encouraging line&#13;
managers to pursue operational research that supports their daily activities without being&#13;
encumbered by the requirements for policy coordination under the action research&#13;
program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
4. THE INTEGRATED HEALTH SERVICES DEVELOPMENT&#13;
PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
4.1   The objectives of the proposed Integrated Health Services Development Project,&#13;
within the framework of the Government's National Health Development Plan, are to (a)&#13;
expand access to health services and improve their utilization; (b) make health services&#13;
available on a sustainable basis; and (c) improve the ability of the MSP to analyze health&#13;
problems, and to formulate, monitor and evaluate policies, strategies and programs. The&#13;
Project seeks to establish the foundation for universal availability of cost-effective,&#13;
technically and culturally appropriate health services that are affordable and sustainable&#13;
to the people and country as a whole, by expanding service delivery for a minimum&#13;
package of health care and reproductive health services, and by expanding MSP capacity&#13;
at the headquarters level. The Project represents the first, three-year phase of a process,&#13;
already initiated by the MSP with the establishment of an initial set of studies and pilot&#13;
projects and PPF support, which is expected to lead to a fully integrated sector&#13;
development and expenditure program. The Project is fundamentally an institutional&#13;
development program, with emphasis on making change in service delivery oriented&#13;
towards priority target populations. It is a key element of the Government's National&#13;
Health Development Plan (PNDS).&#13;
4.2   The Project aims to strengthen MSP services at two levels:&#13;
(a) at the service delivery level, particularly at the periphery, through a minimum&#13;
package of health services (PMA, in its French acronym, for Paquet Minimum&#13;
d'Activites) to be provided by health districts, complemented by strengthened or new&#13;
national programs in the new priorities discussed above - reproductive health,&#13;
information, education and communication for behavior change, and partnerships with&#13;
non-governmental partners. The definition, costing, financing, and introduction of the&#13;
PMA in an initial series of health districts is the central operational objective of the&#13;
project. Financing of PMA introduction at the local level will be driven by requests from&#13;
health districts formulated as district health development plans. Success with the PMA&#13;
implies not only delivery of quality health care services but also the availability and&#13;
financial accessibility of a limited number of essential drugs and acceptable levels of&#13;
utilization by beneficiaries. Effective PMA introduction will be a long and demanding&#13;
process, taking a number of years to reach the entire population. For this reason,&#13;
providing family planning services solely in association with PMA introduction risks&#13;
delaying the country's new priorities; reproductive health services will, for a period, be&#13;
introduced not only in districts benefiting from PMA support to health development&#13;
plans but also separately in other public sector health clinics where they are not yet&#13;
available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
(b) at the manazement level (headquarters, regions, and departments or districts)&#13;
by supporting the long-term institution-building program of action research, studies,&#13;
training and pilot projects described above. At the MSP headquarters level, the central&#13;
objective of the Project is execution and effective follow-up on an institutional&#13;
assessment of the organization, including strengthening of its informatics capacity.&#13;
Execution of the assessment started in May 1995 with PPF support. Three years of&#13;
experience with management and coordination of the MSP program of studies, training&#13;
and pilot activities are expected to strengthen the Ministry's capacity for strategic&#13;
management. A gradual change in perspective in the Ministry is expected, with&#13;
increasing attention to demand variables and beneficiary perspectives. Private voluntary&#13;
providers and community associations will be engaged to the maximum feasible extent,&#13;
but the Project does not addresses the changes that will be required in the long term&#13;
among the country's very conservative private-for-profit health care providers. Over the&#13;
three year period of Project execution, the groundwork will be laid for a substantial&#13;
increase in voluntary private insurance, to complement the planned mutual insurance&#13;
program, and for the gradual reallocation of priority in public sector financial and human&#13;
resources from the tertiary to the primary and secondary levels.&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
1. The Minimum Package (PMA) ($16.4m)&#13;
4.3   The idea of a minimum package of health services (PMA), strongly promoted in&#13;
VW'DR93 and BHA, is welcome in Cote d'Ivoire. The most cost-effective health services&#13;
are already included in the Government's health programs, but they do not receive the&#13;
financial support, human resources and other priorities required to ensure quality services&#13;
and full utilization of existing infrastructure. The technical work on the definition of a&#13;
core set of services which will receive priority in the allocation of public financial and&#13;
human resources has been completed. An MSP working group prepared initial proposals&#13;
for the contents of the PMA in March and April 1995, with suggestions that it be&#13;
delivered by health centers and district hospitals. As refined in January, 1996, the list of&#13;
services (Annex 6) includes: maternal care, delivery, post-natal care; well-baby care,&#13;
including immunizations; family planning; limited curative care (malaria, STDs, acute&#13;
respiratory infections, diarrhea); limited chronic care (TB, leprosy, dracunculiasis, yaws);&#13;
and promotional services (nutrition, water supply and sanitation).&#13;
4.4   The PMA will be made operational through preparation and implementation of a&#13;
series of district health development plans. These plans will specify infrastructure&#13;
rehabilitation, re-equipment, and - where necessary - new construction for district&#13;
headquarters, first referral hospitals (h6pitaux generaux), and health centers; refresher&#13;
and on-the-job training; disease surveillance and reporting; IEC; recapitalization of drug&#13;
stocks where necessary; tools for planning and monitoring; links to other services (such&#13;
as water supply and sanitation) which have a bearing on health outcomes, and links to&#13;
higher levels of the health care system. Districts will have to meet certain eligibility&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
requirements for access to public financial resources to implement their plans; incentives&#13;
for sound performance will be established. The general orientation of the work to be&#13;
done at the MSP in support of the PMA will be to respond to community demand rather&#13;
than simply to offer new supply. Technical staff in the MSP are to provide support to&#13;
health districts in the preparation of their plans, and to advise decision makers at MSP&#13;
headquarters on the quality of the plans. The Project will strengthen the DSC to enable it&#13;
to support PMA work, especially in rural areas, through provision of equipment, training&#13;
in health planning and management, and the provision of consultants' services.&#13;
4.5    Over the three year period of execution of the Project, the Government expects to&#13;
introduce the PMA in about fourteen of the country's fifty planned health districts.&#13;
However, this does not imply that the total population of each district will be reached in&#13;
this period, as further time will be required to complete the construction (where&#13;
necessary) and rehabilitation of health care facilities and the introduction of the training&#13;
and supervision which form an essential part of the PMA. PMA monitoring and&#13;
evaluation will be carried out by the health districts under the guidance of the DSC and&#13;
with the support of a PMA unit in the Minister's Cabinet. This activity will assume&#13;
increasing importance as the PMA is introduced in growing numbers of health districts,&#13;
and financial support is provided to the districts by the MSP and donors. Work plans and&#13;
informal understandings, in the form of agreed lettres de mission, setting out mutual&#13;
expectations, will need to be adopted and monitored; adjustments may be required in&#13;
PMA services according to the varying epidemiological conditions and socio-economic&#13;
circumstances of different parts of the country. The PMA component of the proposed&#13;
Project will not be limited to services provided by public sector health facilities, as it&#13;
includes an experimental element of support to services provided by community&#13;
associations, local authorities, and NGOs (see para 5.11); this pilot activity is responsive&#13;
to the theme of partnerships with other actors for health improvement in the&#13;
Government's letter of health policy. In the interest of establishing and implementing&#13;
national standards for health services, the work on PMA policies supported under the&#13;
proposed Project will apply throughout the country, rather than solely in the fourteen&#13;
districts with plans to be financed by IDA; other interested donors will also be involved&#13;
in the PMA work, under the general umbrella of the National Health Development Plan.&#13;
4.6   The following criteria will be used in reviewing health district development plans&#13;
for financing: (a) criteria addressed to the district team: quality planning, following&#13;
national norms and engaging the totality of the health services partners at the district&#13;
level, and sustainability, particularly in respect of financing incremental recurrent costs;&#13;
(b) criteria addressed to the central authorities: stability in the assignment of personnel,&#13;
and training of the district team; (c) criteria addressed to the local authorities:&#13;
participation in financing of the district plan, to be negotiated locally; (d) criteria&#13;
addressed to the regional directorates: support by the regional directorate concerned. The&#13;
adequacy of poverty focus and the extent of beneficiary participation will be considered,&#13;
particularly after Cote d'Ivoire has established planning tools permitting classification of&#13;
districts by level of poverty.  See Annex 7.  Assurances were obtained during&#13;
negotiations that, before effectiveness of the Credit, the Government will issue and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
distribute a circulaire satisfactory to IDA outlining the format, contents, procedures, and&#13;
eligibility criteria for financing of district health plans.&#13;
2. Reproductive Health: Family Planning and Sexually Transmitted Diseases&#13;
($13.5m)&#13;
4.7   The reproductive health component will support the development and expansion&#13;
of an integrated package of reproductive health (RH) services to be delivered in the&#13;
minimum package of activities, as these are developed and extended throughout the&#13;
health system, and in those services planned in the National Action Plan for Family&#13;
Planning to be carried out by the Government and - under its guidance - by AIBEF, the&#13;
Ivoirian affiliate of a well-known NGO, the International Planned Parenthood&#13;
Federation. The Programme National de Planification Familiale (PNPF) will receive&#13;
training, vehicles, office equipment, medical supplies and equipment, and consultant&#13;
support to strengthen planned programs, address critical needs, and strengthen budding&#13;
NGO/government partnerships.&#13;
4.8   The Project will finance: (a) establishment, rehabilitation and maintenance of&#13;
family planning services in about 100 public sector health centers; (b) construction and&#13;
equipment of family services provided by AIBEF in Man, San Pedro, Yamoussoukro,&#13;
Odienne, Abengourou, and Bondoukou; and rehabilitation of three AIBEF regional&#13;
facilities in Bouake, Daloa, and Korhogo; (c) training, IEC, and studies for strengthening&#13;
of family planning management; and (d) IEC, training, and other intervention programs&#13;
to combat STDs/AIDS, and training and institutional support, including epidemiological&#13;
surveillance, for development of the national AIDS prevention and control program.&#13;
4.9   Many components of the family planning and AIDS programs - such as&#13;
contraceptive supply and IEC - have common needs that can be met in an integrated&#13;
fashion by expanding current and planned FP services into a more integrated package of&#13;
basic RH services. Where the PMA is being tested and later introduced across the health&#13;
system, RH services will be provided in those service sites. Sites identified for RH&#13;
service delivery will be equipped, and staffed to deliver STD screening and treatment,&#13;
HIV screening and referral, and family planning services in recognition of the&#13;
seriousness of the STD and HIV/AIDS epidemic. Basic hygiene in health services (by&#13;
providing expendable and non-expendable disinfectants), and supplies of syringes and&#13;
needles and other necessary items will be assured to PMA and RH service sites. The&#13;
National FP program will be strengthened through training and consultant support to&#13;
permit it to grow into its role of strategizing, planning, coordinating and monitoring the&#13;
national RH/FP effort, and to develop and manage an active IEC program in support of&#13;
program activities.&#13;
4.10  For the control of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, the Project will&#13;
finance: (i) training in program management and coordination for the staff of the&#13;
National AIDS Control program in Abidjan and the regions, to lead to a decentralized&#13;
and well coordinated program; (ii) training in care and management of people infected&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
and affected by the epidemic for health care providers and managers responsible for STD&#13;
services; (iii) medical supplies (reagents, drugs and condoms) and equipment for HIV,&#13;
STDs and TB; and (iv) consultant support to strengthen their planned programs, address&#13;
critical needs, and strengthen partnerships with cooperating bodies in the public and non-&#13;
governmental sectors. The AIDS component of the Project is relatively small, at $3&#13;
million, as the central coordination office for AIDS needs to build up its capacity before&#13;
a larger program is undertaken.&#13;
4.11  A substantial amount of non-resident consultant assistance will be needed to&#13;
support execution of the National Family Planning Program. Because of management&#13;
changes, reevaluation of these requirements is required, and high level family planning&#13;
program consultant support is being obtained. During negotiations, assurances were&#13;
obtained that, by the end of 1996, the Executive Directorate for Reproductive Health and&#13;
Family Planning would establish a work program defining the overall technical support&#13;
required by the family planning program and provide it to IDA for review and approval.&#13;
To support improved treatment of STDs, agreement was reached, during negotiations,&#13;
that by the middle of 1997 national guidelines will be established for syndromic&#13;
diagnosis and treatment of STDs, to be consistent with the work now being completed on&#13;
review and validation of treatment algorithms for other diseases.&#13;
3. Planning and Management ($12.3 m)&#13;
4.12  This component of the Project will finance a wide range of studies, pilot&#13;
activities, office equipment and supplies aimed at supporting the National Health&#13;
Development Program (PNDS), including: (a) an institutional assessment and&#13;
organization development program for the MSP; (b) continuation and deepening of the&#13;
action-research and studies program of the MSP initiated with PPF support; (c)&#13;
strengthening of decentralized financial management of MSP services by training and&#13;
supervisory visits at the service delivery level; (d) strengthening of partnerships with&#13;
communities, community associations and health NGOs, through workshops, seminars,&#13;
and training; (e) training, equipping, staffing, and operation of 7 MSP regional&#13;
Directorates in Bondoukou, Bouake, Odienne, Korhogo, Yamoussoukro, and the South (I&#13;
and II, outside of Abidjan); (f) revision of treatment algorithms initiated by the&#13;
Pharmaceuticals Directorate (DMP) of the MSP and publication of a catalogue of&#13;
medicinal equivalents and a newsletter; (g) introduction of revised prescription practices&#13;
through training of doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and private drug sellers; (h)&#13;
strengthening of quality control of medicines by providing equipment and training to the&#13;
DMP, the Pharmacy Faculty, and the National Quality Control Laboratory; (i)&#13;
preparation and introduction of a reform of the curriculum for medical and paramedical&#13;
studies, to be consistent with the PMA, including training at the community level; (j)&#13;
computer support and consultant services to strengthen the Directorate of Human&#13;
Resources (DRH) in the MSP and update strategies for planning of recruitment and&#13;
training; (j) introduction into the action-research program of follow-up on the 1995&#13;
review of health sector public expenditures carried out by the MSP and the European&#13;
Commission; and (k) studies on mutual insurance for primary care and expansion of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
complementary private insurance, and establishment, on a pilot basis, of primary care&#13;
mutual insurance in two health districts.&#13;
4.13  In anticipation of new needs, the MSP started the institutional assessment in May-&#13;
June 1995 with PPF support and facilitating assistance of consultants. Further missions&#13;
and a workshop with MSP stakeholders to review initial results took place in late 1995&#13;
and early 1996; a work program has been prepared. The assessment is examining the&#13;
capacities of the Ministry at the national level, in an environment of decentralization.&#13;
Gaps are being identified between current realities and models for the future. Over time,&#13;
new definitions of the role(s) of the MSP need to be worked out as part of the MSP&#13;
development program, and new links to non-governmental providers created, as the&#13;
Ministry gradually reduces its role in the management and financing of the country's&#13;
major public sector tertiary and university hospitals.&#13;
4. Information and Health ($7.8 m)&#13;
4.14  This component of the Project will consist of: (a) establishment of a national&#13;
system for epidemiological surveillance; (b) development and operation of a continuing&#13;
program of beneficiary assessment (Observatoire des Bdineficieres); (c) development and&#13;
application of a national policy for health IEC and operation of IEC interventions to&#13;
promote healthy behavior; (d) improved functioning of the MSP Management&#13;
Information System (SIG) and its increased use in decision-making; and (e) development&#13;
and use of a planning tool called health mapping (carte sanitaire).&#13;
4.15  The centerpiece of this component is the further pursuit of the Management&#13;
Information System initiated under the Bank-financed Health and Demographic Project.&#13;
The MIS managed by the MSP Department of Control, Evaluation and Health&#13;
Information (DCEIS) is to be computerized, and an annual report on health is to be&#13;
produced. A significant new element is regular beneficiary feedback on health services,&#13;
both locally and on a national level. Baseline data are now being collected. The&#13;
permanent beneficiary monitoring system will provide information on demand for and&#13;
satisfaction with the health services provided by the Ministry. This system will use both&#13;
quantitative and qualitative methods to determine the health demands of local&#13;
communities, the decision-making process followed by households in choosing health&#13;
care providers, obstacles to increased utilization of Government services, and ways&#13;
public sector primary care providers can meet community demand. These data will&#13;
complement and deepen the information (see Annex 16) available from the 1995&#13;
household surveys carried out by the INS and the client consultations sponsored by the&#13;
Bank over the past several years as part of Project preparation (see Annex 15).&#13;
4.16 Human and financial resource management systems require updating and&#13;
decentralization from the core agencies of finance and civil service to the sectoral&#13;
agencies, and ultimately to the health districts. Before this can be done, information&#13;
systems and the data base will be updated. Work in this area has been initiated under the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
Human Resources Management Project which accompanied the Human Resources&#13;
Development Program.&#13;
4.17  The information and health component will provide a substantial strengthening of&#13;
information, education and communication (IEC) capacity for health in Cote d'Ivoire.&#13;
IEC activities have been in existence in the RCI in some form for over 30 years. They&#13;
were fragmented in terms of program design and management, emphasized mass media&#13;
which reached more of the elite than populations most at risk, were not sustained, and&#13;
little effort was made to evaluate impact. Nonetheless, both within and outside the public&#13;
sector there are sociologists, anthropologists, and communications experts who have IEC&#13;
experience, especially in social marketing. In January 1995, a national IEC/Population&#13;
network was created (Reseau IEC/Population). In April 1995, a workshop (Atelier de&#13;
Reflexion IEC) was held to engage the principal actors in a process of defining a national&#13;
IEC policy, the main lines of intervention, and mechanisms for coordination. Work on&#13;
the policy has been nearly completed, and the Project will support institutional&#13;
strengthening for health IEC and the execution of IEC programs in priority areas,&#13;
including especially family planning and AIDS. The MSP IEC staff will serve as a&#13;
coordinating body, and support IEC programs of others. IEC interventions are to be&#13;
designed and funded with IDA support, and the new national health IEC service will be&#13;
equipped and receive training for its new role. The annual project work program review&#13;
will encompass the detailed plans for preparation, review, execution, and monitoring of&#13;
IEC interventions over the year ahead.&#13;
Project Management ($1.2m)&#13;
4.18  Project management costs involve support for the Project coordination unit in the&#13;
Minister's Cabinet. In addition to incremental contractual staff such as the Project&#13;
accountant, Project management costs include annual audits of Project accounts and&#13;
SOEs, consultant assistance for the comprehensive review planned at the end of 1998,&#13;
office equipment and supplies, brief study tours to neighboring countries by staff of the&#13;
Project coordination unit, and annual work program preparation and review workshops&#13;
with the main actors involved in Project execution.&#13;
C. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION AND FISCAL IMPACT&#13;
4.19  The economic justification and analyses undertaken as part of project appraisal&#13;
(see Annex 18) concentrated on the cost-effectiveness of PMA interventions and the&#13;
fiscal impact of universal access to health care through PMA services. Because of the&#13;
time and cost involved, and because of the broadly similar epidemiological and socio-&#13;
economic conditions among African countries, no independent cost effectiveness or cost-&#13;
utility studies were undertaken. However, as detailed in Annex 18, the C6te d'lvoire&#13;
PMA interventions were compared with minimum packages in other African countries&#13;
where detailed studies have been made, including Guinea and Kenya. Broadly speaking,&#13;
the most cost-effective interventions are included in the C6te d'Ivoire PMA. The&#13;
comparisons suggest that Cote d'Ivoire will need to: (a) give increasing attention, in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
resource allocation from public budgets, to interventions for better health provided&#13;
outside the health sector; (b) resist pressures to expand the scope of the interventions&#13;
provided under the PMA; and (c) contain the cost of PMA services.&#13;
4.20 A health services program based on the PMA is both affordable and financeable&#13;
in COte d'Ivoire. In the long term, households are projected to bear a substantial share -&#13;
over 50 percent - of the cost, through cost recovery, but can do so by reallocating a&#13;
portion of their existing health expenditures and without increasing the share of their&#13;
expenditures now devoted to health. While fees vary now according to the nature of the&#13;
service, schemes to moderate the impact of cost recovery on the poor and target&#13;
populations will be needed; indigents are formally exempt already. The responsibility&#13;
for determining and financing exemptions to the universal cost recovery rules lies at the&#13;
commune level.&#13;
4.21  To review the fiscal impact of the Project, projections were made of the&#13;
implications of providing universal coverage of the population under the PMA and of&#13;
providing universal coverage under the present, hospital-oriented health care services.&#13;
With universal coverage of the population under the PMA, and specialized tertiary care&#13;
provided on a referral basis, the MSP is projected in fifteen years annually to require&#13;
CFA francs 125 billion (1996 CFA francs) for health services. Universal coverage under&#13;
the present, hospital-based pattern of health services is projected to require Government&#13;
health expenditures of CFA francs 201 billion. In fifteen years projected resources&#13;
available annually for Government financing of health services are CFA francs 176&#13;
billion under the Bank's standard economic growth scenario, on the assumption that&#13;
historical budget shares are not changed. The Government's MSP budget projections&#13;
through 1999 are consistent with the goal of achieving universal PMA coverage in ten&#13;
years. Thus universal coverage is projected to be fiscally affordable under the PMA, as&#13;
long as its cost is contained, but not under the present pattern of health services. Because&#13;
of the sensitivity of this analysis to the PMA cost, it is important to develop refined cost&#13;
estimates; this work is now underway with MSP sponsorship.&#13;
D. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING&#13;
4.22  The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$52 million, with a foreign&#13;
exchange component of US$23.3 million equivalent to 45 percent of total project costs.&#13;
Base costs are estimated on the basis of March 1996 CFA francs and an exchange rate of&#13;
USI = CFA francs 500. Physical contingencies amount to 10 percent on civil works and&#13;
goods. Price contingencies have been calculated at 2.4 percent per annum for foreign&#13;
costs during the entire Project execution period and for local costs at 3.8 percent for&#13;
1997, and 2.6 for 1998 and 1999. Summary tables of cost estimates by component are in&#13;
Annex 19.&#13;
4.23  The proposed IDA credit will be US$40 million equivalent, representing 77&#13;
percent of total cost.  Domestic counterpart financing will be of US$12 million&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
equivalent, or 23 percent of total costs and will be made up of US$11.8 million from&#13;
Government allocations and $200,000 from beneficiaries.&#13;

4.24   Operating Costs during Project Execution. Execution of the Project would&#13;
include operating costs estimated at about US$11.5 million equivalent ($8.5 million&#13;
excluding drugs), or 21.2 percent of total Project cost over a three year period. Of this&#13;
amount, US$2.8 million would finance the pay of contractual staff to be hired for the&#13;
execution of the Project, including a training and development team for the PMA and&#13;
other staff for Project management.  To operate facilities strengthened by Project&#13;
investments, these costs include purchases of drugs and other medical consumables,&#13;
representing about US$3.0 million, after the initial purchase to recapitalize stocks of&#13;
district health facilities under their health development plans. Operating costs would also&#13;
include expenditures for supervision and financial management of the Project, and for&#13;
maintenance of facilities, vehicles and equipment, totaling about US$5.7 million during&#13;
Project execution.&#13;

expenditures for full expansion of PMA services to all health districts and universal&#13;
coverage of the population, and their implications for the national budget and the&#13;
Government's resource allocation to the sector. (See economic justification and fiscal&#13;
impact, and Annex 18).&#13;
4.26 Absorption of Contractual Staff. The institutional assessment now being&#13;
performed with the MSP, and other institutional development activities carried out under&#13;
the Project, will generate new MSP skills requirements and profiles, needed to carry out&#13;
the health programs being developed. Upon completion of Project implementation and&#13;
subject to any overall civil service staffing and reform plans, incremental contractual&#13;
staff hired initially for Project execution may be absorbed by the MSP on the basis of&#13;
their skills and performance and of the newly defined skills profiles and assessed needs;&#13;
however, the MSP can offer no guarantees and will have to examine the situation&#13;
carefully upon Project completion. Over time it is expected that new skills will replace&#13;
those of others who should be more directly engaged in service delivery, but - because&#13;
new staff can be more easily recruited than older staff retrained, reassigned, and/or&#13;
retired - making change in the global skills profile of the Ministry may initially lead to&#13;
see some expansion at the headquarters level. A list of contractual staff expected to be&#13;
hired during Project execution is available in Annex 20C.&#13;
5. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. STATUS OF PROJECT PREPARATION&#13;
5.1   The various components of the Project are at different stages of preparation, but&#13;
are generally well advanced and in some cases already in execution. A PPF advance was&#13;
granted by IDA in March, 1995, and a grant from the Government of Japan to support&#13;
Project preparation was approved in July, 1995. Prior to Board presentation, the&#13;
Government has approved and signed an arrete on the establishment, organization and&#13;
operation of the Project management services.&#13;
5.2   Work on the PMA is advancing steadily, under the direction of the Minister's&#13;
Cabinet. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the MSP will maintain a&#13;
PMA unit in the Minister's Cabinet, consisting of at least two public health specialists&#13;
and a health economist, to support health districts, under the PMA, family planning and&#13;
AIDS programs, and to provide support and advice to the DSC and health districts.&#13;
Arretes on the organization and operation of the health districts and on the Project&#13;
management services will be published in the Journal Officiel before Credit&#13;
effectiveness. While still essentially a pilot program under the larger PMA component,&#13;
the small NGO and community organization sub-component requires additional&#13;
preparation, with support from international staff to complement the work now under&#13;
way by local consultants. NGOs in Cote d'Ivoire are recognized by individual decree&#13;
when they are found to be of public value; such decrees are managed by the Ministry of&#13;
the Interior and approved by the Council of Ministers. Assurances were obtained during&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
negotiations that, before disbursements are made for the services of community groups&#13;
beyond the initial experimental services under the PPF, a Conseiller technique in the&#13;
Minister's Cabinet will be assigned responsibility for relations with community&#13;
organizations, under TOR acceptable to the Association, and a framework for MSP&#13;
cooperation with community groups acceptable to IDA will be adopted, including&#13;
criteria, policies and processes for evaluating and financing their services; essentially, the&#13;
NGOs should operate as contractors.  The Conseiller technique will be assisted by a&#13;
sociologist and a specialist from the community movement. The procedures manual for&#13;
this component will specify that, at least initially, all project-financed services by&#13;
community groups will be subject to prior Bank approval.&#13;
5.3   The reproductive health components are well advanced in preparation. Execution&#13;
of the national family planning program has already begun. As envisaged under the 1996&#13;
reorganization of the MSP, the final management structure of the family planning&#13;
program needs strengthening; Project-financed consultant services will aid in this task.&#13;
Assurances were received during negotiations that by the end of 1996 the MSP will&#13;
conclude an agreement with AIBEF acceptable to the Association setting out the&#13;
arrangements for execution of the component of the project for which AIBEF will be&#13;
responsible. The AIDS/STD services component will take somewhat more preparation,&#13;
and especially a strengthening of the management of the Executive Directorate&#13;
responsible for AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases and tuberculosis. Assurances were&#13;
received during negotiations that the Government will appoint a financial administrator&#13;
in each of the Executive Directorates for AIDS and family planning under TOR&#13;
satisfactory to IDA.  Furthermore, the Project provides for six person-months of&#13;
intensive international consultant support to evaluate problems of management and&#13;
administration in the Executive Directorate for HIV/AIDS and assist it to put in place a&#13;
management system that will permit it to play its central coordinating role.&#13;
5.4   The program of studies, training and pilot activities for the planning and&#13;
management and information and health components of the Project was first prepared in&#13;
February and March, 1995. Execution is already underway with PPF and Japan Grant&#13;
support. A provisional version of the program was formally issued by the MSP in&#13;
December 1995, and the program will be periodically updated.&#13;
B. MANAGEMENT&#13;
5.5   During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the following personnel&#13;
acceptable to the Bank will be appointed and maintained in place for project purposes&#13;
throughout project execution: A Project Coordinator, a Project financial administrator,&#13;
and a project accountant, in the Project coordination unit; two public health specialists&#13;
and a health economist, in the PMA unit of the Minister's Cabinet, for support to health&#13;
districts. The Project Coordinator and Project financial administrator were appointed and&#13;
in place prior to negotiations, and the other personnel will be appointed and in place as&#13;
a condition of effectiveness. Also prior to negotiations, the Government prepared&#13;
proposals for the accountability, staffing and authority (including job descriptions) of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
MSP services which will be involved in project execution. The final version of these&#13;
proposals will be contained in the Project implementation manual.&#13;
5.6   Project execution will be integrated to the maximum possible extent into the daily&#13;
activities of the responsible operating services of the MSP, and the office of the Project&#13;
Coordinator will not be a Project implementation unit. The major service delivery&#13;
activities will be carried out outside the central Ministry, by health districts and non-&#13;
governmental health care providers. Work plans will be prepared and approved for the&#13;
project-financed activities; contracts will also be concluded with non-governmental&#13;
service providers. An exanple of an MSP-NGO contract already exists governing the&#13;
cooperation between the MSP and the Ivorian affiliate of the International Planned&#13;
Parenthood Federation, AIBEF. Beyond these arrangements, a number of MSP units,&#13;
and other Ministries, will inevitably be involved in Project execution, particularly in&#13;
Project administration. During negotiations, assurances were obtained on the&#13;
establishment and TOR of a Monitoring Committee for the Project; the Committee will&#13;
be established under the arret establishing the Project management services adopted as a&#13;
condition of Board presentation (see Annex 22).  Prior to negotiations, the&#13;
Government completed a draft Project implementation manual acceptable to IDA; its&#13;
final version will include the Project accounting manual, performance indicators,&#13;
procurement, and a full presentation of the content, cost, rationale, and execution&#13;
modalities of each Project component; a manual acceptable to IDA will be adopted as a&#13;
condition of Credit effectiveness.&#13;
5.7   An initial study to evaluate the financial management capacity of MSP and the&#13;
primary health entities at the periphery has recently been completed. The weak financial&#13;
management capacity of MSP and its decentralized subordinate bodies has been&#13;
confirmed. Major improvements are necessary to raise the level of financial management&#13;
of the health services before autonomy in decision making and cost recovery can be&#13;
made to work effectively. Another study, currently in draft, is investigating ways to&#13;
expedite the flow of public budget funds to primary providers. However, the studies do&#13;
not provide a sufficient basis to move forward with stronger decentralized financial&#13;
management across the whole health sector, and further consultant support will be&#13;
required. During negotiations assurances were obtained that, by the end of 1997, the&#13;
Government will present to IDA an action plan, prepared on the basis of criteria&#13;
satisfactory to IDA, defining specific steps to substantially increase the accounting&#13;
autonomy and financial management capacity of local public sector health care&#13;
providers. Aspects to be covered include their decision-making over cost recovery&#13;
receipts and ways of minimizing delays in arrival of public budget funds at the primary&#13;
provider level.&#13;
5.8   Project preparation was hampered by administrative delays in releasing&#13;
counterpart funds for the PPF. Therefore, prior to negotiations, the Ministry of Finance&#13;
transferred to an MSP account the remaining counterpart funds for the IDA PPF: 82&#13;
million CFA francs. Also, as a condition of effectiveness the Ministry of Finance will&#13;
deposit in an MSP Project account funds required for the first four months of Project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
execution: 315 million CFA francs. The account will be replenished on a quarterly&#13;
basis or whenever its balance shall be less than 200 million CFA francs.&#13;
5.9   Under the Project, under contract with MSP, AIBEF will operate new family&#13;
planning service delivery facilities in six regional capitals, and rehabilitated facilities in&#13;
three other regional capitals, construct and operate clinics in Adjame, and at its&#13;
headquarters. AIBEF has specialized skills and experience in the field of family&#13;
planning not available in the public sector, and receives MSP subsidies for its work. It&#13;
will continue to manage the distribution of contraceptives and tracking of contraceptive&#13;
supplies and to provide special family planning management information services to&#13;
MSP until these activities can be integrated into the regular services of the MSP.&#13;
However, it will not own the facilities it operates, which will be constructed or&#13;
rehabilitated by the MSP.&#13;
5.10  The Project is expected to be completed by March 31, 2000 and the proposed&#13;
Credit to be closed by September 30, 2000.&#13;
C. THE ROLES OF NON-GOVERNMENTAL AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS&#13;
5.11  While NGOs have been working in health in C6te d'Ivoire for many years,&#13;
NGOs, community associations, and local authorities are not as developed in the field of&#13;
health as in many other African countries. In recent years more of these bodies have&#13;
started to work on health and sanitation issues, and the general reaction from&#13;
beneficiaries has been positive. The MSP has concluded that it is now opportune to&#13;
establish closer relationships with such groups working in the health sector to take&#13;
advantage of the dynamic relationship between them and their local populations in order&#13;
to expand the coverage of basic health services. Thus the PMA component of the&#13;
Project contains a pilot sub-component for this purpose.&#13;
5.12 The MSP is establishing a focal point for relations with community groups.&#13;
Consultants are preparing a framework to structure this cooperation in the future, to&#13;
encompass both dialogue between the Ministry and its non-governmental partners on&#13;
health policies and strategies and financial support for services to populations that can be&#13;
reached more efficiently and effectively through community bodies than MSP services.&#13;
Under the Project, qualified NGOs, local authorities, and community associations may&#13;
contract with the government to expand their provision of PMA health services to&#13;
priority groups. Eligibility criteria will be strictly defined, both as to the types of bodies&#13;
that can apply and the types of services that will be funded, including training to&#13;
strengthen the management capacity of qualified groups. If the pilot component is&#13;
successful, other donors may wish to participate as the demand for funds rises and the&#13;
supply of viable community body proposals increases.&#13;
5.13  During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the MSP will recruit a&#13;
sociologist and a specialist originating in the community movement to work in the&#13;
Cabinet on the MSP program of cooperation with community groups. This staff will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
also have administrative responsibility for the experimental services. The team will&#13;
establish procedures, prepare necessary information, provide back-up to field offices and&#13;
make final decisions on funding requests from groups. During execution of the Project,&#13;
offices will also be set up in selected regions as local contact points for community&#13;
groups wishing to apply for funding. These offices will be responsible for identifying&#13;
community bodies in the health sector, providing them information on funding&#13;
possibilities, helping them prepare funding requests and following-up on contracts that&#13;
have been awarded. As the component is an experiment, it is expected that only 10-15&#13;
groups per year per region will receive funding and that the size of the contracts will be&#13;
relatively limited (average size of US$10,000).&#13;
D. BENEFICIARIES, TARGET GROUPS, AND PARTICIPATION&#13;
5.14 Health equity is a major issue in CMte d'Ivoire. In 1995, the richest quintile of the&#13;
population benefited from 31 percent of public spending on health, whereas the poorest&#13;
quintile had only 11 percent. The public health subsidy is poorly targeted: The poorest&#13;
40 percent of the population received only 29 percent of the public subsidy in 1995,&#13;
while the richest quintile received 31 percent. The per capita health subsidy is 34 percent&#13;
lower in rural areas than in urban areas. The pattern of hospital care and financing lies&#13;
behind this targeting issue; it should also be noted that the per capita subsidy in rural&#13;
hospitals is less than one-third that in urban hospitals. Cote d'Ivoire will join in a Bank-&#13;
sponsored research project which should help it to target public budget funds more&#13;
effectively as a function of poverty and income. Public officials are increasingly aware&#13;
of and sensitive to health equity issues but it must be recognized that they are long-term,&#13;
fundamental problems in the political economy of health and development in CMte&#13;
d'Ivoire.&#13;
5.15  The proposed Project aims to create a foundation for universal access to health&#13;
services, which would be a great achievement in the fight against poverty in Cote&#13;
d'Ivoire. The ultimate beneficiaries of the Project will be concentrated among those who&#13;
are relatively less well off. The PMA is designed to reach the entire Ivorian population,&#13;
but its core interventions are of greatest interest to the poorer population.  The&#13;
Observatoire des Beneficiares will help to make public sector health services more&#13;
responsive to the perceived needs of the people, and particularly of the poor. The PNDS&#13;
is not, by definition, targeted towards the poor, and it must be recognized that the less&#13;
well off population groups tend to use health services less than others. It is expected that,&#13;
over time and beyond the period of Project execution, the PMA will lead to substantially&#13;
higher levels of use of health services among the poorer population. Since around 60&#13;
percent of medical consultations among the lowest two expenditure quintiles were at&#13;
public sector health centers in 1995, and about 50 percent of consultations among the two&#13;
highest quintiles were at public sector hospitals, a program, such as the PMA,&#13;
concentrated on strengthening services at health centers will benefit the poor relatively&#13;
more than the rich. Thus, without being exclusively oriented towards the poor, the&#13;
Project represents an operational, health systems-oriented approach to a poverty-&#13;
conscious health services strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
5.16 Findings from the 1995 household survey shed light on poverty and health&#13;
services, and the importance of the changes to be promoted by the proposed Project.&#13;
According to the survey results, people in the lowest expenditure quintiles were less&#13;
likely to report an illness than those in better off households; among those who reported&#13;
an illness in the two weeks previous to the survey, nearly 50 percent sought medical care;&#13;
the proportion of women seeking care was lower than would be expected; non-poor&#13;
households spent an average of CFA francs 28,500 on health care, poor households lying&#13;
between the two National Institute of Statistics (INS) poverty lines spent only 19 percent&#13;
of this amount, and households in the poorest decile spent only 7 percent. Taking the&#13;
initiative for preventive care consultations was all but unknown. Over 90 percent of&#13;
consultations for modem health services were reported to have taken place in public&#13;
sector facilities. Pharmaceuticals (excluding traditional medicines) made up about 50&#13;
percent, and in some cases even more, of household expenditures on health in 1995;&#13;
pharmaceuticals are - by far - the principal household concern when questions are asked&#13;
about health services. The public subsidy on health care was 34 percent lower in rural&#13;
than in urban areas, the amount going to the lowest quintile was 64 percent lower than&#13;
the per capita mount obtained by the highest quintile; only 11 percent of public sector&#13;
health spending benefited the poorest 20 percent of the population, and 30 percent of&#13;
spending benefited the poorest 40 percent.&#13;
5.17  The Project preparation process engaged a wide range of stakeholders in a series&#13;
of client consultations, and this dialogue will continue during Project execution and&#13;
beyond. The client consultations (see Annex 15) addressed the future of health care in&#13;
Cote d'Ivoire; health perceptions, attitudes and practices of a wide range of heads of&#13;
households in two health districts; and motivation and behavior of health care providers&#13;
in Cote d'Ivoire. The private sector was seen to be quite defensive, and limited in its&#13;
geographical reach. Public and private sector providers both have a certain skepticism&#13;
regarding the other. A gradual rapprochement between the two should be sought.&#13;
Deterioration in confidence of the people in both public and private providers was noted.&#13;
Initially, the MSP staff were reluctant to listen to others' views. Thanks to the client&#13;
consultations, and the Observatoire des Beneficiaires to be established under the&#13;
proposed Project, greater openness can be expected; the client consultations will be&#13;
continued, as needed, under the Observatoire des Beneficiaires program. Furthermore,&#13;
the demand-based approach to district health development plan financing and&#13;
implementation will strengthen the need for providers to participate in a dialogue with&#13;
beneficiaries. The management committees (COGES) for health facilities will be an&#13;
important forum for the participation of beneficiaries in the management of public sector&#13;
health services. Finally, the establishment of a framework for dialogue between the MSP&#13;
and community groups, and the pilot services to be provided by them, will increase the&#13;
participation of beneficiaries in MSP services at both the policy and operational levels,&#13;
and complement the other actions taken to give increasing attention to demand variables.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
E. ANNUAL AND MID-TERM REVIEWS&#13;
5.18 Annual work program and budget reviews will be central to project management.&#13;
The Project will support key components of the PNDS, which will engage a number of&#13;
donors. For this reason, it is impossible to define the program in detail several years in&#13;
advance of execution, particularly in respect of services which are to be responsive to&#13;
demand expressed at the district level. Other donors interested in project activities will&#13;
be invited to participate in the annual Project reviews within the framework of the&#13;
ongoing government-led consultations with donors. Assurances were received during&#13;
negotiations that a comprehensive review will be held at the end of 1998, the second&#13;
year of project execution, under TOR satisfactory to the Bank. This review will cover,&#13;
among other topics, the extent to which the institutional objectives of the Project are&#13;
being achieved, an assessment of the impact achieved thus far by the Project and its&#13;
sustainability, audit and other obligations under the Credit, and performance against key&#13;
indicators. The review will also provide an occasion to make an initial joint stock-taking&#13;
of Project successes, and to launch the preparation of a new operation in the health&#13;
sector.&#13;
5.19 During negotiations, agreement was also reached on the following specific&#13;
measures to facilitate Project implementation and review: (a) annual joint MSP-IDA&#13;
reviews of future work plans and budgets to be prepared by the MSP for institutional&#13;
strengthening and service delivery under the Project; and (b) establishment by the end of&#13;
1996 of an annual calendar and process for internal review of Project activities in the&#13;
previous year and plans for the forthcoming year, including particularly PMA, family&#13;
planning and AIDS prevention and control activities.&#13;
F. PROCUREMENT&#13;
5.20 Procurement Methods. Table 5 below summarizes Project expenditures, their&#13;
estimated costs, and the proposed methods of procurement. Works and goods financed&#13;
under the proposed IDA Credit that would be procured through International Competitive&#13;
Bidding (ICB) would follow the Bank guidelines "Procurement under IBRD Loans and&#13;
IDA Credits", January 1995, and standard bidding documents for ICB. Government&#13;
documents and procedures acceptable to IDA for National Competitive Bidding (NCB)&#13;
would be used for the works and goods to be procured through NCB. Consultant services&#13;
financed under the Credit would be procured in accordance with the "Guidelines for the&#13;
Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing&#13;
Agency", (August 1981). Section 3.15 of the procurement guidelines published in&#13;
January 1995 would apply to NGOs, local authorities, and community associations&#13;
involved in procurement under the Project, as described in Section 5. C above. A&#13;
standard timetable for key procurement steps will be included in the Project&#13;
implementation manual. The main responsibility for procurement of works and goods&#13;
will lie with the MSP Directorate for Equipment, Materials, and Maintenance (DEMM),&#13;
which is currently responsible for procurement under a number of other donor-financed&#13;
projects. If a lack of human or technical capacity leads the DEMM to fall behind on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
agreed procurement calendar, it will make use of consultant services. The same applies&#13;
to the PSP, which will be responsible for procurement of pharmaceuticals under the&#13;
Project.&#13;
5.21 Works (US$8.3 million). The civil works program includes mostly renovation&#13;
work, including the rehabilitation of six district hospitals, and about 100 family planning&#13;
and STD centers. Construction of new buildings (US$3.1) is for two FP clinics, six&#13;
regional FP facilities and three district-level offices. In view of the nature of the work to&#13;
be carried out, mostly rehabilitation (US$5.2 million), in remote and dispersed areas&#13;
(districts), the civil works contracts, even if packaged in larger lots, are not likely to&#13;
attract intemational competition.&#13;
(a)   NCB: Civil works contracts estimated to cost US$1.5 million or less per&#13;
contract and up to an aggregate amount of US$7.8 would be awarded under National&#13;
Competitive Bidding (NCB) and would be open to foreign bidders who wish to&#13;
participate.&#13;
(b)   Other methods: Given the overall purpose of the Project, construction&#13;
works on health facilities run by NGOs or local communities, costing no more than&#13;
US$30,000, up to an aggregate amount of US$500,000, would be procured for rural&#13;
health facilities under community participation (para 3.15 of the Bank Procurement&#13;
Guidelines). The procedures to be followed would be reviewed and agreed by the Bank&#13;
and included in a procedures manual for the pilot NGO component.&#13;
5.22 Goods (US$19.0 million, including drugs). To the extent practicable, contracts&#13;
for goods would be grouped into bid packages to cost $200,000 or more. Goods to be&#13;
procured under the Project include surgical and medical equipment and small medical&#13;
apparatus, as well as office furniture and equipment, vehicles, and drugs and medical&#13;
consumables.&#13;
(a)   Goods other than drugs and medical consumables:&#13;
(i) ICB: All contracts for medical and other equipment, and vehicles&#13;
estimated to cost US$200,000 or more per contract would be procured through&#13;
International Competitive Bidding (ICB);&#13;
(ii) NCB: Goods estimated to cost US$30,000 or more per contract but&#13;
less than $200,000, up to an aggregate amount of US$3.6 million, would be&#13;
procured through NCB, if the products are available locally;&#13;
(iii) Other methods:&#13;
Exceptions to ICB procurement may be made, if necessary, for&#13;
vehicles needed for Project start, up to an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$200,000; they would be purchased either through (a) UNDP's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
Inter-Agency Procurement Services Office (IAPSO), or (b) national&#13;
shopping with a minimum of three quotations;&#13;
* Goods valued below US$30,000 would be procured by (a) national&#13;
shopping procedures acceptable to IDA (with a minimum of three&#13;
quotations) up to an aggregate amount of US$1.0 million, and (b)&#13;
direct contracting of equipment of a proprietary nature justified by&#13;
requirements for standardization (including computers, software,&#13;
medical equipment), estimated to cost less than $30,000 per contract,&#13;
up to an aggregate amount of US$500,000; and&#13;
* When necessary for the execution of the Project, small equipment&#13;
valued at less than US$15,000 per contract, and up to an aggregate&#13;
amount of US$400,000, may be purchased by NGOs or community&#13;
associations, in accordance with para 3.15 of the Bank Procurement&#13;
Guidelines.&#13;
(b)   Drugs and other medical supplies would be procured through the&#13;
Pharmacie de la Sante Publique (PSP), whose procurement and management&#13;
procedures have been improved through donor-funded support. Community&#13;
organizations, local authorities, and NGOs would be allowed to purchase drugs&#13;
from PSP for their project related services. The procedures would be detailed in&#13;
the NGO procedures manual. The PSP would procure them through procedures&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, such as:&#13;
(i) ICB: All contracts estimated to cost US$100,000 or more would be&#13;
procured using ICB.&#13;
(ii) NCB: Small contracts for some drugs and medical supplies produced&#13;
locally, estimated to cost US$30,000 or more, but less than US$100,000, per&#13;
contract and up to an aggregate amount of US$0.4 million, would be awarded&#13;
under NCB procedures.&#13;
(iii) Other methods: Contraceptives for the Project (US$2.1 million) may&#13;
be procured from the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) following para.&#13;
3.9 of Bank Procurement Guidelines. The Government will help prepare the&#13;
French language technical specifications, registration in RCI, and quality control&#13;
information.&#13;
5.23 Training (US$5.0 million) includes training abroad (US$0.8 million) and local&#13;
training (US$4.2 million).  External training needs represent 80 person-months.&#13;
Whenever appropriate, external training would take place in Africa. Details of external&#13;
and local training are contained in Annex 20B. Plans for training to be financed by IDA&#13;
would be reviewed and approved annually by IDA in the framework of the annual&#13;
program reviews.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
5.24 Consulting Services (US$5.8 million) and Studies (US$2.9 million). The&#13;
Project would finance 207 person-months of external specialist support for project&#13;
implementation and 500 person-months of local consulting services, including support&#13;
for project management. Details of external and local consultant services and a list of&#13;
studies and research activities are available in Annex 20A. In order to alleviate the&#13;
administrative burden of numerous small contracts, Government would, whenever&#13;
practicable, package consulting services into larger contracts.&#13;
5.25  NGO Services (US$2.5 million). Proposals for Project-financed health services&#13;
by NGOs, local collectivities, and community associations would be reviewed&#13;
individually by both the MSP and the Bank. Information for proposals, criteria for&#13;
selection, and details on managing the funds would be provided in an NGO procedures&#13;
manual. In each case, a contract would be concluded with the MSP. Community bodies&#13;
involved in provision of project-financed services, would follow either (a) Bank&#13;
procedures as described in this section--whenever feasible--, or (b) efficient methods and&#13;
procedures determined in advance jointly with the MSP and reviewed and agreed by the&#13;
Bank and set out in the NGO procedures manual.&#13;
5.26 Operating Costs (US$8.5, excluding drugs) for the MSP, health services&#13;
facilities and non-governmental health services providers involved in the Project,&#13;
including office supplies, compensation of contractual staff (US$2.8), local travel,&#13;
supervision and training subsistence allowances for local staff, and vehicle/equipment&#13;
operation and maintenance, would be procured and paid for following regular&#13;
Government procedures, acceptable to IDA. A list of contractual staff to be hired during&#13;
Project execution is available in Annex 20C.&#13;
5.27 Review by IDA. Prior IDA review would be required for (a) all contracts above&#13;
the threshold of US$200,000 for civil works and goods, including drugs; (b) all&#13;
consulting services and training contracts estimated to cost more than US$100,000 (for&#13;
consulting firms), US$50,000 (for individual consultants); and (c) all terms of reference&#13;
for specialist and training services and all sole source contracts, regardless of contract&#13;
value, and any amendment to a contract bringing its value above US$100,000 for firms&#13;
and US$50,000 for individuals. The NGO procedures manual to be completed before&#13;
disbursements begin under this component (see para 5.2) would specify that all proposals&#13;
for NGO services would be subject to prior IDA review. Selective post-review of&#13;
awarded contracts below the prior review thresholds would be conducted by supervision&#13;
missions or third parties chosen under conditions acceptable to IDA. All other contracts&#13;
would be subject to selective post review.&#13;

G. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
5.28 To facilitate Project implementation and reduce the volume of withdrawal&#13;
applications, a Special Account will be opened in CFA francs at the Caisse Autonome&#13;
d'Amortissement (CAA). It will be managed by the MSP. The authorized allocation will&#13;
arnount to CFA francs I billion and cover about four months of eligible expenditures.&#13;
Upon effectiveness, an amount of CFA francs 500 million representing 50 percent of the&#13;
authorized allocation will be deposited in the Special Account. The remaining balance&#13;
will be made available when the total amount withdrawn from the Credit account and/or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
special commitments issued amounts to the SDR equivalent of US$20 million. The&#13;
Special Account will be used for all payments below US$400,000. Replenishments will&#13;
be submitted monthly. All replenishments should be fully documented except for: (a)&#13;
contracts of less than US$200,000 for works and goods, (b) contracts for less than&#13;
US$100,000 for consultant services - firms, (c) contracts for less than US$50,000 for&#13;
consulting services - individuals, which will be claimed on the basis of Statements of&#13;
Expenditures (SOEs). All supporting documentation for SOEs will be retained for&#13;
review by periodic Bank supervision missions and external auditors.&#13;

H. ACCOUNTING, AUDITING AND REPORTING&#13;
5.29   The Project coordination unit will be responsible for the project's financial&#13;
management and will maintain consolidated project accounts.   Project accounts,&#13;
including the Special Account and Statements of Expenditure, will be audited annually&#13;
by independent auditors acceptable to IDA; all disbursements under SOEs will be audited&#13;
semi-annually. As a condition of effectiveness, the borrower will conclude a contract&#13;
with an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank to audit the Project accounts.&#13;
6. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
6.1    Proiect Benefits. The immediately measurable benefits of the Project will be&#13;
institutional: strengthened MSP capacity and strengthened service delivery, and&#13;
expansion of the focus of health leaders beyond traditional curative care to preventive&#13;
services, reproductive health, and - to a lesser extent - nutrition. While attribution to the&#13;
Project is virtually impossible, the programs to be supported by IDA are expected to&#13;
contribute to long-term improvements in health outcomes, particularly reduced fertility,&#13;
improved child health, and a relatively reduced burden from sexually transmitted and&#13;
other diseases. Work undertaken for World Development Report 1993 - Investing in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
Health, Better Health in Africa, and other country-specific studies in Africa clearly&#13;
demonstrate that the proposed approach - provision of a minimum package of health&#13;
services by community-supported and managed health centers, first referral hospitals,&#13;
and health districts - is the least cost method to achieve universal coverage and&#13;
substantial and sustainable health gains. See Annex 18.&#13;
6.2   Project Risks. The main non-quantifiable risks concern: (a) limited commitment&#13;
to universally accessible, cost-effective PHN  interventions that are feasible and&#13;
sustainable, including particularly reproductive health, with the associated risk of&#13;
political interference; (b) the resistance to change generated by substantial past&#13;
investments in facilities and human resources oriented towards health services models,&#13;
and a centralized public sector management culture, that are inconsistent with the social&#13;
and economic realities and needs of the country; and (c) limited MSP and community&#13;
group capacity, both centrally and at the periphery, to execute Government and donor-&#13;
financed programs. These risks are being mitigated by institutionalizing regular&#13;
beneficiary assessments, the recently completed institutional assessment of MSP and the&#13;
follow-up organization development program, locating overall responsibility for the&#13;
Project in the Minister's Cabinet, building institutional support for community groups&#13;
into the Project, and limiting project external financing to three years. The option, of a&#13;
'simple' Project (limited, say, to a fully pre-defined set of health activities) might make&#13;
the IDA-financed activity appear relatively easy to execute, as an isolated operation.&#13;
But, it would increase the geographical division of health services among donors and&#13;
would not be able to address the fundamental health sector policy and institutional issues&#13;
that inhibit accelerated improvements in health outcomes and widening coverage with&#13;
health services in Cote d'lvoire, nor would it be any easier when Project activities were&#13;
integrated into regular Government programs at the operating stage. Government&#13;
ownership of the Project both outside and within the MSP needs, nonetheless, to be&#13;
increased. A Project launch workshop will be held to that end, IEC activities are&#13;
planned, allocations of staff time for supervision are planned commensurate to the task,&#13;
and trust fund support for supervision work is being pre-programmed.&#13;
6.3   The main risks that have been quantified concern an increase in the cost of the&#13;
PMA, a decline in Government financial support to health, and the impact of reduced&#13;
economic growth. A 50 percent increase in the cost of the PMA, either by mis-&#13;
estimation of present costs or by expansion of the range of services provided, would&#13;
increase MSP expenditures by about two-thirds; this shows the importance of attention to&#13;
cost containment as Cote d'Ivoire pursues the goal of universal access to health care.&#13;
Financing univeral coverage with PMA services, with GDP growth at 50 percent of the&#13;
rate projected by the Bank, and with a 50 percent decline in the share of Government&#13;
expenditures devoted to health, would require an increase of one third in the health share&#13;
of household expenditures from its current level of 4.5 percent, to 6.0 percent. While&#13;
conceivable, such as shift would require a major communications effort which a&#13;
Government not giving priority to health would undoubtedly have difficulty making.&#13;
Financing universal PMA coverage with a reduction of economic growth by 50 percent&#13;
but keeping the current MSP share in Government expenditures would still be feasible,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
for it would not require an increase of the Ministry of Public Health budget above&#13;
projected values. Thus the Bank's economic growth scenario underscores the great value&#13;
of a sound macroeconomy for health improvement but suggests also that the PMA should&#13;
be sustainable even with economic growth at about the same rate as population growth.&#13;
This would not be the case if Cote d'Ivoire were to seek universal coverage under its&#13;
present pattern of expensive hospital-based health services.&#13;
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
7.1   Before negotiations, the Government:&#13;
(a)   prepared a draft letter of health policy (para 3.6);&#13;
(b)   prepared proposals for the accountability, staffing, and authority&#13;
(including job descriptions) of the MSP units which will be involved in Project&#13;
execution (para 5.5);&#13;
(c)   appointed a Project Coordinator and a Project financial administrator, both&#13;
acceptable to the Association (para 5.5);&#13;
(d)   completed a draft Project implementation manual acceptable to the&#13;
Association which will - in its final version - include the Project accounting&#13;
manual, performance indicators, and a full presentation of the content, cost,&#13;

the Association a health policy letter discussed during negotiations (para 3.6);&#13;
the Government has also adopted and signed an arrete on the establishment,&#13;
organization, and operation of the Project management services (para 5.6).&#13;
7.3   Before effectiveness, the Government will:&#13;
(a)   deposit CFA francs 315 million, required for the first four months of&#13;
project execution, in the MSP Project Account (para 5.8);.&#13;
(b)   issue and distribute a circulaire outlining the format, contents, procedures&#13;
and eligibility for financing of district health development plans (para 4.6);&#13;
(c)   staff, with personnel acceptable to the Association, the units responsible in&#13;
the Minister's Cabinet (i) for overall coordination of Project execution, with a&#13;
Project accountant in addition to the previously appointed Project Coordinator&#13;

health districts and on the creation, organization, and operation of the Project&#13;
management services (para 5.2);&#13;
(e)   contract independent auditors for the auditing of all Project-related&#13;
accounts (para 5.29);&#13;
(f)   adopt a Project implementation manual, satisfactory to the Association,&#13;
including a Project accounting manual, performance indicators, procurement, and&#13;
a full presentation of the content, cost, rationale, and execution modalities for&#13;

President de la Banque Mondiale&#13;

WASHINGTON DC 20433 ETATS UNIS&#13;
Monsieur le President,&#13;
Au moment ou les negociations relatives au Projet de Developpement des&#13;
Services de Sante Integres s'engagent avec votre Institution, dans le cadre du&#13;
Plan National de Developpement Sanitaire, j'ai l'honneur de vous adresser, au&#13;
nom du Chef de l'Etat et du Gouvernement de Cote d'Ivoire, la lette ci-apres.&#13;
La sante est largement deterrnine par le niveau de developpement atteint et&#13;
tout aussi deteriniante pour le developpement a venir, surtout quand celui-ci&#13;
s'appuie sur la valon'sation des Ressources Humaines, comme en C6te d'Ivoire.&#13;
Ce bin6me Sante-Developpement est i la base de toutes les&#13;
recommandations internationales auxquelles la C6te d'Ivoire a souscrit&#13;
depuis l'adoption de la strategie des Soims de Sante Primaires (SSP) adoptee a&#13;
Alma Ata en 1978.&#13;
La Cote d'Ivoire, apres deux decennies de croissance (1960 - 1980) qui&#13;
avaient nettement ameliore la plupart des indicateurs sanitaires nationaux, a&#13;
connu la crise economique de la decennie 80, caracterisee par la baisse des&#13;
ressources allouees aux secteurs sociaux qui, a leur tour, ont entraInm (i) la baisse&#13;
qualitative et quantitative des services offerts dans ces secteurs et (ii) la&#13;
deterioration des conditions de vie des populations vulnerables, en particulier, les&#13;
populations rurales, les menages urbains disposant de faibles revenus ainsi que&#13;
les populations feminines, affectees principalement par la baisse de la qualite des&#13;
services et accedant difficilement aux services sociaux. En outre, la forte&#13;
croissance demographique que connait la Cote d'Ivoire a exerce une pression de&#13;
plus en plus lourde sur la demande en services de sante que le systeme sanitaire&#13;
national n'a pas su satisfaire. Entre 1980 et 1991, le PNB par habitant a baisse&#13;
annuellement de 4,6 %, ramenant celui-ci a 690 $EU.&#13;
C'est dans ce contexte difficile, mais propice a la reflexion et aux&#13;
mutations, que le Gouvernement, fidele a la tradition d'une politique de&#13;
developpement fonde sur l'Homme, a adopte le 31 juillet 1991 une&#13;
Declaration de Politique de Developpement des Ressources Humaines dont&#13;

l'objectif fondamental 6tait: "l'amelioration du niveau de vie et du bien-etre&#13;
de la population par une meilleure adequation quantitative et qualitative&#13;
entre l'offre et la demande en matiere de sante, d'education et d'emploi".&#13;
Pour atteindre cet objectif, le Gouvemement a elabore, en collaboration&#13;
avec la communaute financiere intemationale, un Programme de Valorisation des&#13;
Ressources Humaines (PVRH) execute sur la periode de 1991 A 1994.&#13;
A la lumiere des progres enregistres durant ces quatre annees dans les&#13;
secteurs des ressources humaines, notamment en matiere (i) de reformes&#13;
politiques, institutionnelles et reglementaires, (ii) de maitrise des mecanismes de&#13;
contr6le budgetaire aimsi que (iii) de la pertinence de l'approche multisectonrelle,&#13;
la Cote d'Ivoire a decide de poursuivre les reformes engages.&#13;
Apres avoir formule, A l'occasion de la reunion du Groupe Consultatif les&#13;
15 et 16 juin 1995 A Paris, une esquisse de strategie pour la sante et pour le&#13;
financement de ses acfivites durant la periode 1995-1997, la CMte d'ivoire&#13;
entend poursuivre ses efforts en se dotant, A present, d'un veritable Plan&#13;
National de Developpement Sanitaire (PNDS) pour la decennie 1996-2005.&#13;
Ce Plan, adopte par le Gouvemement, a I'ambition d'etablir un diagnostic&#13;
de la situation sanitaire actuelle, de fixer des objectifs A moyen et long termes, de&#13;
formuler une strategie inspiree des acquis du PVRH et d'une vision globale et&#13;
prospective du systeme sanitaire national, de decrire une batterie d'activites en&#13;
decoulant et de proposer une serie de moyens necessaires a la realisation dudit&#13;
programme. Ce Plan est elabore dans un nouveau contexte caracterise&#13;
principalement par une conjoncture economique favorable et par le demarrage&#13;
d'une politique de population axee en premier lieu sur la sante de la reproduction.&#13;
C'est A partir de ce Plan National de Developpement Sanitaire que la CMte&#13;
d'Ivoire entend nouer une nouvelle relation de partenariat avec les&#13;
organisations internationales et les bailleurs de fonds, afin que leurs&#13;
contributions techniques et financieres trouvent un cadre propice A la satisfaction&#13;
de leurs inter&amp;s respectifs et de ceux de la promotion d'une meilleure sante pour&#13;
les populations ivoiriennes.&#13;

La presente declaration, qui donne les grandes lignes de ce Plan, s'articule&#13;

I - RAPPEL DE L'EVOLUTION ECONOMIQUE&#13;
1.1. Periode 1980-1989&#13;
La decennie 1980 s'est caracterisee par un prolongement de la degradation&#13;
de la situation economique du pays malgre les resultats positifs enregistres en&#13;
1985 et 1986, essentiellement grace A un redressement ephemere des cours du&#13;
cafe et du cacao. L'effondrement des cours A partir de 1987 a provoque une&#13;
rechute de F'activite economique et contraint le pays a poursuivre et renforcer les&#13;
politiques d'ajustement structurel entrepn'ses anterieurement.&#13;
1.2. Nriode 1989-1994&#13;
Ainsi, le Gouvernement a elabore, a partir de 1989, un programme&#13;
ambitieux de relance economique a moyen terme, axe sur un assainissement&#13;
drastique des finances publiques et sur le renforcement des reformes structurelles.&#13;
Des politiques sectorielles ont egalement ete mises en place pour eliniiner les&#13;
distorsions et les rigidites auxquelles l'economie etait soumise, notamment dans&#13;
les domaines de l'agriculture (PASA), de l1'nergie (PASE) et de l'eau (PASEA).&#13;
Ce programme a e  complete par un second volet de reformes structurelles visant&#13;
le retablissement de la competitivite du secteur industriel (PASCO), la&#13;
restructuration du systeme financier (PASFI), la valorisation des ressources&#13;
humaines (PASRH), et le desengagement de l'Etat des activites productives au&#13;
profit du secteur prive (Privatisation). Parallelement, le Gouvernement a procede&#13;
a un allegement sensible de la fiscalite et A une restructuration de la dette&#13;
publique interieure.&#13;
En depit des efforts consentis et des resultats encourageants obtenus, les&#13;
contraintes economiques et financieres sont demeurees fortes. La croissance est&#13;
restee  stagnante  voire  parfois  negative,  l'activite  economique  ayant&#13;
particulierement souffert de la baisse des investissements tant publics que prives,&#13;
et de la contraction de la demande consecutive A la baisse du revenu par habitant&#13;
(26,3 % entre 1987 et 1990). Ainsi, compte tenu de l'accroissement&#13;

demographique dont le taux annuel est de 3,8 %, le revenu par habitant,&#13;
etait de 690 Dollars EU en 1991. Ce revenu est tres inegalement reparti. En&#13;
effet, en 1988, 20 % de la population detenait 44,1 % de ce revenu. Le&#13;
pourcentage des populations vivant en dessous du seuil de pauvret6 absolue&#13;
s'elevait en 1985 a 30 % dans les zones urbaines et a 26 % en zone rurale. Les&#13;
regions geographiques les plus depourvues se trouvent en zone rurale et les&#13;
categories socioprofessionnelles les plus vulnerables sont les agriculteurs de&#13;
cultures vivrieres et d'exportation. Au niveau du ch6mage, on denombrait plus de&#13;
12,5 % de ch6meurs en 1990, avec un rythme de croissance de 7 % par an contre&#13;
4 % en ce qui conceme la population potentiellement active.&#13;
La pauvrete s'est donc fondamentalement accrue durant cette periode.&#13;
Ainsi, plus de 30 % de la population vivent en dessous du seuil d'extreme&#13;
pauvrete, contre 10 % seulement en 1985. Le monde rural comporte plus de&#13;
70 % des pauvres, a cause de la forte baisse des revenus ruraux consecutive a la&#13;
reduction de plus de la moitie des prix aux producteurs des principales&#13;
speculations agricoles. La situation economique de la C6te d'Ivoire en 1993&#13;
refletait donc cette crise persistante.&#13;
De plus, la surevaluation du Franc CFA constituait un handicap majeur&#13;
pour la competitivite de l'economie. En accord avec ses partenaires de la Zone&#13;
Franc, le Gouvemement a, en consequence, decide une modification de la&#13;
parite du Franc CFA de 50 % par rapport au Franc Fran,ais en janvier&#13;
1994. Cette importante mesure, conjuguee au renforcement des efforts&#13;
d'ajustement et a l'acceleration des reformes structurelles vise a permettre un&#13;
retour rapide a une croissance soutenue et un retablissement durable de la&#13;
viabilite financiere du pays.&#13;
1.3. Periode 1994-1996&#13;
Suite a la modification de la panite du F.CFA par rapport au Franc&#13;
Fran,ais, d'importantes mesures d'accompagnement ont et&amp; mises en oeuvre afin&#13;
d'assurer une relance economique. Les resultats obtenus au cours des deux&#13;
annees ecoulees sont globalement satisfaisants.&#13;
En effet, la croissance economique amorcee en 1994 avec un taux de 1,8 %&#13;
s'est confirmee en 1995 avec une croissance d'environ 7,0 %. L'inflation a ete&#13;
maitrisee avec un taux de 32 % en 1994, puis 7,7 % en 1995. Ces indicateurs de&#13;
bonne tenue de l'activite economique sont accompagnes d'une reprise des&#13;
investissements et de l'emploi. Ils traduisent une amelioration significative de la&#13;
competitivite de l'economie ivoirienne. Le retour de la croissance economique en&#13;

1994 s'est donc consolide en 1995 avec un taux de croissance largement&#13;
superieur au taux de croissance demographique.&#13;
1.4. Perspectives&#13;
Le programme economique et financier a moyen terme vise i&#13;
poursuivre les efforts entrepris par le Gouvemement pour restaurer les conditions&#13;
d'une croissance forte et diversifiee, consolider le retablissement de la viabilite&#13;
financiere interieure et exterieure, et ameliorer le niveau et le cadre de vie de la&#13;
population, tout en reduisant les disparites sociales. A cet effet, le Gouvemement&#13;
a decide d'accelerer les refornes structurelles initiees depuis 1989, en vue de&#13;
renforcer la flexibilite de 1'economie et eliminer les distorsions encore existantes&#13;
qui faussent la structure des incitations et freiment la croissance du secteur des&#13;
biens echangeables.&#13;
Conform6ment a ces objectifs, le programme a moyen terme pour la&#13;
periode 1996-1998 vise a: (i) consolider la competitivite de l'econornie et&#13;
renforcer la diversification de la structure productive et des exportations,&#13;
(ii) porter le taux de croissance a environ 7,7 % des 1996 pour atteindre 8,1 % en&#13;
1997 et au moims 10 % des 1998, (iii) degager un excedent budgetaire primnaire&#13;
susceptible de couvrir une part croissante du service de la dette interieure et&#13;
exterieure, (iv) soutenir et promouvoir le developpement du secteur prive,&#13;
(v) developper l'ensemble des ressources humaines du pays, (vi) renforcer la&#13;
lutte contre la pauvrete et (vii) renforcer la lutte contre la degradation de&#13;
l'environnement naturel et ameliorer le cadre de vie des populations.&#13;
I - RAPPEL DE L'EVOLUTION DE LA SITUATION SANITAIRE&#13;
2.1. tvolution de l'offre des services&#13;
2.1.1. Histonrque&#13;
Herite de l'epoque coloniale marquee par une forte distinction entre la&#13;
medecine de base et la medecine hospitaliere, le systeme sanitaire national ne&#13;
s'est pas demarque de cette tendance, qui, tout en dotant le pays d'une&#13;
infrastructure sanitaire imposante, n'a pas suffisamment developpe les services de&#13;
base distribuant des soins essentiels preventifs et curatifs. La periode de crise&#13;
economique a aussi mis au grand jour les insuffisances dans la gestion du systeme&#13;
et l'impossibilite de poursuivre la gratuite des soims.&#13;
2.1.2. Organisation et fonctionnement du systeme actuel&#13;

ANNEXE 2&#13;
L'organisation actuelle du Ministere de la Sante repond a la volonte&#13;
d'adopter une vision manageriale, axee sur la r6solution des grands problemes&#13;
sanitaires.&#13;
Le service sanitaire public comprend actuellement 1.146 etablissements de&#13;
tout niveau, animes par plus de 16.000 agents, dont 1.329 appartenant au corps&#13;
medical. La couverture des populations rurales est actuellement d'un dispensaire&#13;
pour 10.000 habitants et d'une maternite pour 14.100 femmes en age de procreer,&#13;
le ratio medecin/habitants a un pour 9.000 habitants. Ce ratio etait en 1990 d'un&#13;
medecin pour 12.300 habitants.&#13;
Le systeme sanitaire prive compte 358 services medicaux et paramedicaux&#13;
ainsi que 383 officines de pharmacie.&#13;
Le budget consacre par l'Etat a la sante est, en 1996, de 52 milliards pour&#13;
le fonctionnement et de 42,7 milliards pour les investissements (dons compris),&#13;
soit environ 8 % du total.&#13;
La contribution des menages s'eleve a environ 10 milliards (medicaments&#13;
et actes de sante). En effet, apres avoir pu organiser une sante gratuite durant les&#13;
premieres decennies, la crise economique a conduit a rechercher des ressources&#13;
additionnelles pour le financement du systeme en instituant un recouvrement des&#13;
couits des actes de sante, d'abord au seul niveau des EPN, puis, en 1994, pour&#13;
l'ensemble du systeme sanitaire public.&#13;
Globalement, les depenses totales de sante (publiques et privees)&#13;
s'etablissent a plus de 11.000 F.CFA par habitant, soit 22 dollars EU,&#13;
demontrant l'effort consenti par la Cote d'Ivoire, effort qu'il convient, a present,&#13;
d'orienter vers une rationalisation et une utilisation optimale.&#13;
2.1.3. Prestations&#13;
La quasi totalite des prestations sont dispensees a travers des programmes&#13;
sanitaires nationaux.&#13;
2.2. Evolution de la demande&#13;
Trois elements majeurs ont influence F'etat general de la sante des&#13;
ivoiriens. II s'agit (i) d'un tableau epidemiologique charge et varie, (ii) d'une&#13;
fecondite trop forte qui greve lourdement la sante matemelle et infantile et (iii)&#13;
des conditions d'hygiene publique encore precaires et d'une alimentation&#13;
qualitativement deficiente.&#13;
2.2.1 . Un tableau epidemiologique charge et varie&#13;
L'analyse de la situation epidemiologique demontre la persistance, voire la&#13;
recrudescence des grandes endermies tropicales, des maladies sexuellement&#13;
transmissibles, de la tuberculose et les maladies de l'enfance au premier chef des&#13;
problemes sanitaires du pays. A cela, il convient d'ajouter, d'une part, I'apparition&#13;

recente de nouvelles end6mies, notamment le SIDA et l'ulcere de Buruli- et&#13;
d'autre part, 1'emergence des pathologies liees au d6veloppement (traumatismes&#13;
du travail ou de la route, drogues, maladies cardio vasculaires...).&#13;
2.2.2. Unef&amp;condite elevie&#13;
La fecondite conna2t un niveau global tres e1eve avec un taux brut de&#13;
natalite de 45 pour 1.000 et un indice synthetique de fecondite de 6,6. Elle est&#13;
restee quasiment stable sur la periode 1978-1995.&#13;
Cette fecondite elevee induit une population tres jeune: plus de 45 % de la&#13;
population a moins de 15 ans.&#13;
Les repercussions se font sentir fortement sur la sante de la mere et de&#13;
1'enfant.&#13;
La mortalite infantile et maternelle ne pourra connaitre une regression que&#13;
si la fecondite est mieux maitris6e par les couples.&#13;
2.2.3. Une hygiene et une alimentation insuffisante&#13;
L'urbanisation rapide et un exode rural partiellement controle ont&#13;
engendre des conditions d'installation peu propices au respect des regles&#13;
elementaires d'hygiene publique et domestique. Les habitats precaires et les&#13;
logements spontanes qui se sont crees, tant6t a la peripherie, tant6t au cceur des&#13;
villes, sont autant de foyers de maladies epidemiques. Si l'on y ajoute le faible&#13;
niveau de revenu de leurs occupants, on associe toutes les causes d'un etat&#13;
sanitaire souvent deplorable, favorisant l'eclosion de tous les fleaux socio-&#13;
sanitaires (maladies infantiles, paludisme, maladies sexuellement transmissibles,&#13;
malnutrition ..... ).&#13;
Globalement, la mortalite generale a beaucoup regresse entre 30 ans,&#13;
passant de 30 pour 1000 a 12 pour mille. Cependant, la mortalite infantile et&#13;
maternelle reste encore trop forte avec des taux respectifs de 88 pour 1000 et 400&#13;
pour 100.000 naissances vivantes.&#13;
L'esperance de vie est passee de 33 ans en 1960 a 56 ans actuellement.&#13;

III - PROBLEMATIQUE DU SECTEUR SANITAIRE&#13;
Malgre les progres enregistres, la situation sanitaire est loin d'etre&#13;
satisfaisante. En effet, d'une part, la situation epidemiologique demeure&#13;
preoccupante et constitue un defi majeur pour toute politique sanitaire et d'autre&#13;
part, l'organisation et le fonctionnement du systeme sanitaire restent&#13;
insuffisamment articules.&#13;
3.1. Au niveau de l'offre des services&#13;
3.1.1. Dysfonctionnement dans l 'organisation et lefonctionnement&#13;
Les dysfonctionnements importants enregistris, tant dans&#13;
l'organisation que le fonctionnement du systeme ne peuvent qu'influencer&#13;
negativement les resultats et les performances de celui-ci&#13;
3.1.1.1. Au niveau des structures&#13;
Dans la sous-region, les infrastructures sanitaires de la CMte d'Ivoire sont&#13;
parmi celles qui presentent les meilleurs plateaux techniques. Pourtant, l'offre de&#13;
soins semble insuffisante.&#13;
En effet, on constate que la plupart des formations sanitaires sont&#13;
devenues insuffisamment fonctionnelles, autant a cause de batiments&#13;
serieusement delabres ou particulierement inadaptes (en particulier les locaux de&#13;
pharmacie) que d'equipements souvent hors service. Le manque de moyens&#13;
d'entretien et de maintenance en est la cause inimmdiate ; la penurie de ressources&#13;
du secteur public et le manque de politique clairement definie et d'outils de&#13;
gestion dans ce domaine en sont les causes profondes.&#13;
A cela, iI convient d'ajouter que ces structures sont inegalement reparties&#13;
au plan regional, faisant apparaitre de fortes disparites de couverture et donc&#13;
de  disponibilite  des  prestations  sanitaires.  L'insuffisance  de  la&#13;
programmation est a l'origine de cette situation.&#13;
3.1.1.2. Au niveau des personnels&#13;
Le ratio medecin/habitants (1 pour 9.000) est nettement meilleur que celui&#13;
observe en Afrique Sub-Saharienne (23 850), mais se situe en dessous du niveau&#13;
moyen enregistre dans les pays a revenu intermediaire (4 790) et encore loin de la&#13;
norme OMS (2 000). Il est de meme des ratios paramedicaux/population.&#13;

ANNEXE2&#13;
Malgre cet effectif superieur aux moyennes sous-regionales, le service&#13;
offert par le personnel medical et paramedical est juge insuffisant pour differentes&#13;
raisons.&#13;
La motivation professionnelle est insuffisante pour que soient valorisees&#13;
a leur meilleur niveau les competences acquises. Le sens du service public n'a pas&#13;
atteint toutes les consciences, ce qui induit de graves lacunes dans l'accueil et la&#13;
prise en charge des patients. Sans doute, la degradation de l'outil de travail n'est&#13;
elle pas etrangere a cette situation.&#13;
Le personnel est aussi mal reparti, aussi bien sur le territoire national&#13;
qu'entre le milieu rural et le milieu urbain ou entre les differents niveaux de soins,&#13;
aggravant encore les disparites dans la disponibilite des soims.&#13;
On note aussi une inadaptation de certains programmes de formation&#13;
et une absence de planification des recyclages.&#13;
Enfin, l'initiative privee est encore balbutiante (a l'exception des&#13;
pharmaciens) et concentree dans les grandes villes, ce qui est aggrave par le&#13;
manque d'initiative constate chez les jeunes dipl6mes pour leur propre installation&#13;
priv6e.&#13;
3.1.1.3. Au niveau des activites&#13;
Le systeme sanitaire public a connu, jusqu'ici, un developpement et une&#13;
gestion caracterises par:&#13;
- une offre de services supposee satisfaire la demande des&#13;
usagers,&#13;
- une meconnaissance des autres initiatives qui ont vu le jour&#13;
dans le secteur pnrve lucratif et associatif.&#13;
Ces deux tendances ont conduit, en fait, a une imadaptation des&#13;
prestations sanitaires aux besoins essentiels des populations et a une vision&#13;
etriqu&amp;e de la politique sanitaire nationale.&#13;
La vingtaine de programmes sanitaires nationaux fonctionnent encore&#13;
trop verticalement et ne sont pas suffisamment integres dans les activites de&#13;
formations de base chargees de les mettre en oeuvre.&#13;
Un desequilibre est observe entre les prestations curatives et les&#13;
prestations preventives, au depens de ces dernieres pourtant plus rentables au&#13;
plan de la sante publique.&#13;
La productivite des personnels employes dans le secteur tertiaire est&#13;
nettement inferieure a celle observee dans les autres niveaux . Les effectifs de&#13;

personnel, plus nombreux dans le niveau superieur sont moms sollicites que ceux&#13;
affectes dans les niveaux inferieurs.&#13;
Globalement, le volume des activites demeure faible et un certain&#13;
nombre de formations sous utilisees. Le changement de parite du Franc CFA&#13;
intervenu en 1994 a accentue la tendance depressive observee sur la frequentation&#13;
des services, surtout au niveau des parturientes (- 14 %), des femmes (- 12 %) et&#13;
des enfants malades (- 5 %).&#13;
Cette faible activite pose le triple probleme de (i) I'accessibilite&#13;
economique et geographique aux soins, (ii) I'adaptation des prestations a&#13;
I'attente des beneficiaires; outre le problme, en voie de solution, de la reelle&#13;
disponibilite des medicaments dans les fornations sanitaires publiques, veritable&#13;
point d'attraction des populations, se posent ceux de la qualite de l'accueil, de la&#13;
relation humaime et de la disponibilite des personnels, donc de la confiance des&#13;
beneficiaires dans le systeme et enfin (iii), la confiance dans les prestations&#13;
actuelles dispensees par la medecine moderne par rapport aux pratiqueg&#13;
traditionnelles, tres vivaces dans l'ensemble de la population, alors que celles-ci&#13;
sont ignorees par le secteur moderne de la medecine.&#13;
3.1.2. Dysfonctionnement dans la gestion&#13;
Malgre les progres observes dans le cadre de la mise en oeuvre du PVRH,&#13;
l'absence d'une planification et les deficiences methodologiques de&#13;
programmation et de budgetisation sont a l'origine de la non maltrise des&#13;
effectifs, d'une preparation budgetaire encore trop sommaire et d'une&#13;
supervision insuffisante de 1'execution des budgets dont la decentralisation est&#13;
entree en vigueur depuis 1994. En particulier, l'absence de cadre organique pour&#13;
les services et de normes de cofits pour les prestations constituent le principal&#13;
handicap de la budgetisation. Les defauts de transmission des inforrnations&#13;
relatives aux depenses realisees dans les services peripheriques entravent&#13;
lourdement le suivi de l'execution des budgets delegues.&#13;
Enfin, au niveau des investissements, une certaine faiblesse au niveau des&#13;
services d'etudes, de suivi et d'execution s'est traduite par des retards&#13;
d'execution importants et un taux de mobilisation des ressources trop faible.&#13;
Ainsi donc, que ce soient les infrastructures, les personnels ou les activites,&#13;
on retrouve chaque fois, le trait commun d'une gestion insuffisante de moyens&#13;
humains et materiels. Le systeme sanitaire semble malade de sa gestion, et ce&#13;
a tous les niveaux.&#13;
D'abord, a la conception, la deficience de planification, de programmation&#13;
et de budgetisation a conduit a pratiquer une gestion intuitive des besoins et non&#13;

un developpement coherent d'outils de travail. La plupart des dysfonctionnements&#13;
viennent de cette insuffisance.&#13;
Ensuite, a l'execution, sans objectifs precis, sans indicateurs de&#13;
performance clairement d6funis, point de supervision des activites, ni d'actions&#13;
correctives, en cas de defaillance. Cela n'a pas permis d'inculquer aux agents un&#13;
espnt tourne vers les resultats et vers la recompense des plus actifs.&#13;
La combinaison de ces causes conjoncturelles et structurelles a engendre la&#13;
situation actuelle principalement marquee par:&#13;
* une morbidite et mortalite encore trop importante,&#13;
* une accessibilite inegale aux services de sante,&#13;
* une baisse de la qualite des services,&#13;
* une deterioration de la situation des populations vulnerables,&#13;
* une qualite passable de la gestion, tant en matiere de planification&#13;
que de budgetisation.&#13;
Ainsi, la problematique actuelle se resume a un profond desequilibre&#13;
entre l'offre et la demande, et se manifeste par une reelle difficulte a&#13;
repondre de maniere adequate aux besoins de la population, et plus&#13;
particulierement a ceux des groupes vulnerables.&#13;
IV - OBJECTIFS DU PLAN&#13;
Pour faire face a l'ensemble des contraintes et problemes identifies dans le&#13;
domaine de la Sante, le gouvernement entend poursuivre l'objectif fondamental&#13;
d'amrlioration du niveau de vie et du bien-etre de la population par une&#13;
meilleure adequation quantitative et qualitative entre l'offre des prestations&#13;
sanitaires et les besoins essentiels des populations. En cela, il poursuit les&#13;
efforts accomplis durant le PVRH qui ont deja permis de reduire les distorsions&#13;
observees.&#13;
La strategie qu'il mettra en oeuvre sera fondee sur un ensemble coherent&#13;
d'actions concemant la demande et l'offre, appuye par une reorganisation du&#13;
Ministere de la Sante Publique qui comprend desormais des structures specifiques&#13;
charg6es de la planification et du contr6le/evaluation, aninees par des&#13;
economistes.&#13;
Les actions sur la demande  visent la maitrise des phenomenes&#13;
demographiques pour ameliorer rapidement la sante matemelle et infantile et pour&#13;
alleger, a long terme, la charge du systeme sanitaire. Elles visent aussi une&#13;

ANNEXE 2&#13;
meilleure connaissance de cette demande en prestations afin que celle-ci puisse&#13;
rapidement orienter, sinon diriger l'offre.&#13;
Les actions sur l'offre du systeme sanitaire visent en premier lieu a mieux&#13;
tirer parti des moyens existants en effectuant une meilleure repartition du&#13;
personnel et une meilleure allocation des ressources disponibles, en ameliorant&#13;
les ratios couit-efficacite des services (efficacite inteme). Des relations nouvelles&#13;
seront nouees avec les acteurs non etatiques pour accroitre la participation de la&#13;
societe civile et etablir une coherence globale du systeme sanitaire national de&#13;
l'offre publique et privee en prestations sanitaires. Enfin, les efforts realises pour&#13;
une meilleure repartition du personnel vers le secteur primaire sera poursuivi. II&#13;
convient de rappeler que depuis 1994, ce sont respectivement, 75 % en 1994,&#13;
78 % en 1995 et 95 % en 1996 des personnels paramrdicaux sortant de formation&#13;
qui ont e  affectes dans les structures primaires, dont 90 % en rmilieu rural. Il en&#13;
est de m8me des medecins non intemes recrutes depuis 1994 qui ont ete affectes&#13;
a l'interieur du pays (respectivement 80 %, 81 % et 90 %). Cela a permis de&#13;
completer la dotation en medecins exer,ant aux chefs lieux de sous prefecture de&#13;
6 nouveaux medecins en 1994 , de 4 en 1995 et de 32 en 1996. Au total, il ne&#13;
restera plus que 62 sous prefectures a pourvoir (sur 185) dans les deux&#13;
prochaines annees.&#13;
Les objectifs sp6cifiques que le Gouvemement vise a moyen terme pour&#13;
atteindre cet objectif general sont:&#13;
a) la reduction de la morbidite et de la mortalite liees au tableau&#13;
6pid6miologique;&#13;
b) 1'amelioration de 1'efficacite du systeme sanitaire;&#13;
c) I'amelioration de l'utilisation des soins;&#13;
d) I'amelioration de la qualite des prestations sanitaires.&#13;
Les strategies, permettant d'atteindre cet ensemble d'objectifs, sont:&#13;
1/ promouvoir les Soins de Sante Primaires bases sur le Paquet&#13;
Minimum d'Activites;&#13;
2/ promouvoir la multisectorialite et le partenariat avec les autres&#13;
acteurs;&#13;
3/ ameliorer l'accessibilite geographique et financiere aux services&#13;
sanitaires;&#13;

4.1.1. Il s'agira d'organiser la mise en oeuvre generalisee des Soins de&#13;
Sante Primaires (SSP) et de promouvoir une revision des comportements des&#13;
agents de sante. Les SSP reposent sur un paquet d'activites integrees. Un choix&#13;
judicieux des activites presentant le meilleur rapport coiut/efficacite&#13;
permettra de degager le Paquet Minimum d'Activit6s (PMA) adapte a&#13;
l'epid6miologie, au contexte socioculturel national et aux contraintes du&#13;
cadre macro economique.&#13;
Le PMA reprend la liste des activites minimales qu'il est souhaitable&#13;
d'executer dans les diffirents niveaux de la pyraniide sanitaire. II s'agit autant de&#13;
prestations cliniques que d'activites de gestion determinees de maniere a offrir,&#13;
par complementarite, toute la gamme de prestations a travers toute la&#13;
pyramide de service. Ainsi distimgue-t-on:&#13;
- au niveau des formations sanitaires de base 16 modules&#13;
d'activites: consultation prenatale, accouchement, consultation&#13;
postnatale, vaccination, surveillance de la croissance de l'enfant,&#13;
planning familial, soins curatifs y compris MST/SIDA, soins&#13;
chroniques, activites promotionnelles, visite a domicile, supervision,&#13;
planification, suivi des indicateurs, gestion des finances, gestion des&#13;
ressources, gestion des medicaments, activites communautaires;&#13;
- au niveau de I'h6pital general, 11 modules d'activites: soins&#13;
curatifs generaux, soins chirurgicaux, maternite, planning familial,&#13;
soms promotionnels, soins specialises, services medico-techniques,&#13;
service administratif, fonnation/supervision, services techniques&#13;
generaux, activites communautaires;&#13;
- au niveau de l'equipe cadre de district, 7 modules d'activites:&#13;
planification, gestion, supervision, formation, autres actions d'appui&#13;

Une place importante sera faite a la vaccination et a la sante de la&#13;
reproduction qui sont deux activites preventives par excellence. La premiere,&#13;
dans le but d'enrayer la morbidite du premier ige souvent meurtriere, la seconde&#13;
pour (i) ameliorer la sante de la mere et de l'enfant et le bien etre des familles&#13;
(ii) reduire a terme la pression de la demande sur les services sociaux, enfin&#13;
(iii) constituer un maillon important de la politique de population indispensable&#13;
dans la perspective d'un developpement durable et 6quitable.&#13;
4.1.2. II s'agira, par ailleurs, d'intensifier le programme de lutte contre le&#13;
SIDA, les MST et la tuberculose orient6, avant tout, vers la prevention, grace&#13;
a un effort accru de mobilisation des ressources nationales et exterieures orientees&#13;
dans le sens de l'extension des activites de prevention a grande echelle et&#13;
faveur des groupes les plus vulnerables et de la prise en charge psychosociale&#13;
des personnes atteintes du VIH/SIDA. De plus, la qualite de la gestion des&#13;
activites et de la gestion financiere du programme sera renforcee au niveau&#13;
de sa Direction Executive.&#13;
4.1.3. I1 s'agira, aussi, de redynamiser le programme de planification&#13;
familiale, notamment par la promotion des actions d'information,&#13;
d'education et de conseils en vue d'atteindre d'ici 5 ans un taux de&#13;
prevalence de 14%. Ici, aussi, la qualite de la gestion des activites et de la&#13;
gestion financiere du programme sera renforcee au niveau de sa Direction&#13;
Executive.&#13;
4.1.4. Il s'agira, enfin, de developper les activites d'Information-&#13;
Education-Communication pour la Sante, en les confiant a une structure&#13;
specialisee initiant une politique globale, en direction des professionnels du&#13;
secteur et du grand public, axee sur les grandes mutations du systeme&#13;
sanitaire national.&#13;
4.1.5. En conclusion, les activites relatives a la lutte contre les autres&#13;
grandes pathologies, a la base de la forte morbidite enregistree, seront integrees&#13;
dans la mise en ceuvre reguliere du PMA. En effet, le PMA, dispense&#13;
progressivement dans toutes les formations sanitaires, sera initie a partir des&#13;
grands programmes nationaux de sante, dont il conviendra de conjuguer la&#13;
caracteristique naturellement verticale dans 1'approche de la lutte de chaque&#13;
probleme sanitaire (specificites de I'epidemiologie, de sa surveillance, des&#13;

humains et materiels communs ou complementaires.&#13;
La revision des programmes de sante se realisera dans ce sens et, plus&#13;
particulierement, en veillant a leur integration au niveau operationnel et en&#13;
utilisant les resultats des etudes prevues pour la mise en place d'un systeme de&#13;
surveillance epidemiologique plus efficace. Ce processus permettra, en outre, de&#13;
repondre aux exigences de la devolution nationale du programme de lutte contre&#13;
l'onchocercose. Cette revision sera completee par l'elaboration, la mise a&#13;
disposition et 1'exploitation d'outils techniques (normes et standards) qui&#13;
garantiront une amelioration de la qualite des diagnostics, des traitements et des&#13;
soms (Guide Therapeutique NatiQnal, Guides pratiques de soins infirmiers, Table&#13;
des medicaments substituables....).&#13;
La mise en ceuvre du Paquet Minimum d'Activites sera favorisee par&#13;
(i) I'augmentation sensible de la part des ressources financieres allouees au&#13;
secteur primaire qui est deja passee de 28 % en 1992 a 32 % en 1996, ainsi que&#13;
par la maitrise de leur gestion par la peripherie, (ii) la mise en place d'une&#13;
structure de pilotage specifique au mnveau central et (iii) une planification par&#13;
district de la mise en ceuvre du PMA.&#13;
Au total, I'amelioration escomptee pour 2005 de l'etat general de la&#13;
sante de la population se caracterisera, entre autres indicateurs, par une mortalite&#13;
infantile de l'ordre de 50 pour 1000, une mortalite maternelle inferieure a&#13;
200 pour 100.000 en milieu rural, une esperance de vie i la naissance de 60.&#13;
ans, une couverture vaccinale adequate de 90%, un taux de malnutrition&#13;
inferieur a 12%, une elimination des carences en iode, fer et vitamines A, un&#13;
taux d'utilisation des sachets de rehydratation orale de 80%. En outre, la&#13;
poliomyelite, la dracunculose et le tetanos neonatal seront eradiques, tandis&#13;
que les autres grandes endemies seront contr61ees efficacement de maniere a&#13;
en reduire l'extension et l'impact sur les populations.&#13;
4.2. Promouvoir la multisectorialite et le partenariat avec les autres&#13;
acteurs&#13;
Un nouveau schema est a initier, tant dans le developpement que dans la&#13;
gestion du secteur sanitaire qui doit, desormais, 8tre apprehende comme&#13;
gouverne, non plus par l'offre, mais par la demande de services et comme&#13;
une seule entite nationale, dans ses composantes publiques et privees.&#13;
La promotion de ce nouveau schema sera guidee par plusieurs orientations.&#13;
A la deconcentration de ses services deja amorcee doit 8tre alli6e&#13;
une veritable decentralisation des responsabilites au niveau des&#13;
communautes et de leurs representants. La sante faisant partie des&#13;

besoins fondamentaux et des droits inalienables de l'Homme, sa gestion'ne&#13;
peut echapper, pas plus a la responsabilite de l'Etat pour sa partie&#13;
organisation qu'a celle des individus et des communautes pour son&#13;
fonctionnement. Ainsi, le systeme sanitaire, pour deboucher sur la sante&#13;
pour tous, doit etre la preoccupation de tous.&#13;
L'Etat ne peut se soustraire a ses obligations de mettre A la&#13;
disposition de tous des infrastructures et du personnel qualifie et de veiller&#13;
a ce que les prestations sanitaires de base soient accessibles a tous et&#13;
correspondent bien A l'attente des populations. A ce niveau, un effort&#13;
important doit etre entrepris pour assurer la meilleure connaissance&#13;
possible des besoins ressentis par celles-ci. La mise en place et&#13;
l'exploitation systematique des appreciations des usagers issues d'un&#13;
observatoire des beneficiaires y aidera.&#13;
De la meme maniere, les communautes sont desommais appelees a&#13;
s'impliquer dans l'organisation et la gestion des activites de sante, afin que&#13;
celles-ci correspondent bien aux besoins prioritaires qu'elles ressentent et&#13;
que les agents sanitaires dispensent bien des prestations de qualite. C'est le&#13;
sens de la creation des Comites de Gestion des formations sanitaires qui&#13;
sont largement investis de ces responsabilites, mais dont la formation et la&#13;
promotion seront developpees.&#13;
Cependant, la decentralisation ne prendra toute sa dimension&#13;
qu'en reconnaissant le r6le du secteur non etatique et qu'en incitant&#13;
son developpement dans le cadre global d'un systeme sanitaire&#13;
national.&#13;
Ce secteur non etatique doit etre per,u dans toutes ses composantes,&#13;
que celles-ci concement (i) l'implication encore trop timide des&#13;
communes dans la creation et la gestion des services de base, (ii) le&#13;
developpement du mouvement associatif par le biais d'ONG d'usagers,&#13;
prestataires de services sanitaires, (iii) l'organisation des professions&#13;
sanitaires privees, notamment les jeunes medecins, dans le sens d'une&#13;
association au service public par conventionnement, (iv) l'interessement&#13;
du secteur lucratif a la gestion des soins tertiaires grace a l'emergence&#13;
de la mutualisation du risque maladie ou, enfin, (v) la colaboration des&#13;
praticiens traditionnels en vue d'une organisation concertee et non plus&#13;
concurrente.&#13;
Dans cette optique, il est essentiel d'identifier les autres secteurs publics et&#13;
les mouvements associatifs sanitaires (ONG, associations caritatives et&#13;
mouvements confessionnels) et d'etablir un cadre juridique et pratique&#13;
suffisamment flexible definissant les conditions et les criteres de participation des&#13;

uns et des autres a la mise en place du programme d'action de la politique&#13;
sanitaire nationale. En termes specifiques, il s'agira d'abord de d6finir les&#13;
mecanismes de financement et les procedures de gestion, les criteres d'e1igibilite&#13;
des ONG ainsi que les criteres et le processus de selection des projets, les&#13;
procedures d'execution, de suivi d'evaluation des projets selectionnes et les&#13;
critres de participation des communautes (nombre d'individus touches,&#13;
implantations geographiques, satisfaction des besoins endogenes...). I1 s'agira&#13;
ensuite de planifier un processus de consultation entre le Ministere de la Sante&#13;
Publique, les mouvements associatifs, dont les ONG, et les autres secteurs&#13;
publics pour definir les mecanismes de collaboration dans les activites de Sante&#13;
en termes de relations d'ONG entre elles (nationales, imtemationales) et avec le&#13;
Ministere de la Sante Publique.&#13;
Contrairement aux autres pays de l'Afrique de l'Ouest, l'emergence des&#13;
ONG dans le domaime sanitaire est relativement recente en Cote d'Ivoire, a&#13;
l'exception des mouvements confessionnels. Mais ddja, selon la perceptiorn&#13;
generale, les beneficiaires sont, d'une maniere globale, satisfaits des services&#13;
offerts par les organismes a base communautaire et confessionnels, ce qui&#13;
confirme l'opinion selon laquelle le mouvement associatif represente souvent&#13;
une approche efficace pour atteindre des resultats concrets en matiere de&#13;
sante au niveau des menages surtout les plus vulnerables.&#13;
Aussi, semble-t-il opportun de promouvoir l'engagement de la societe&#13;
civile par la voie associative dans le developpement de la politique sanitaire, ce&#13;
qui constitue une mesure appropriee pour faciliter le consensus national&#13;
necessaire pour garantir la reussite des reformes fondamentales du systeme&#13;

fmancement que pr6ne la nouvelle politique sanitaire justifie la pertinence de ce&#13;
projet dont les resultats contribueront a renforcer l'efficacite des programmes, en&#13;
particulier celui de la sante reproductive. En pratique, ce processus permettra au&#13;
Ministere de la Sante Publique de mettre en place toutes les dispositions&#13;
institutionnelles et juridiques pour mieux gerer la vie associative du secteur&#13;
sanitaire, toutes choses non encore etablies et disponibles actuellement.&#13;
La CMte d'Ivoire s'acheminera ainsi vers un nouveau schema de&#13;
partage des responsabilites, base sur un partenariat entre I'Etat, les&#13;
communautes et les organisations qui representent leurs interets et&#13;
l'ensemble des professionnels de la sante, tous agissant dans le cadre global&#13;
du systeme sanitaire national.&#13;

De plus, la sante ne dependant pas que des avancees de la medecine,&#13;
elle est directement liee a 1'6volution de toute une serie de facteurs agissant dans&#13;
des secteurs connexes, conduisant ainsi a opter pour une vision large et&#13;
intersectorielle de I'avenir. Une vision prospective doit etre adoptee pour&#13;
decrypter le systeme sanitaire national, tel qu'il fonctionnera durant les&#13;
premieres decennies du XXI eme siIcle.&#13;
4.3. Ameliorer P'accessibilite geographique et financiere aux services&#13;
sanitaires&#13;
Le renforcement de la couverture sanitaire est une necessite pour.ameliorer&#13;
le niveau general de la sante des populations. Par couverture sanitaire, il faut&#13;
entendre, non seulement, (i) la remise en etat fonctionnel de l'ensemble des&#13;
infrastructures sanitaires actuelles, (ii) la densification du reseau de centres de&#13;
sante et d'h6pitaux, (iii) la disponibilite et l'accessibilite des medicaments&#13;
essentiels, mais aussi (iv) la promotion d'un systeme de protection sociale&#13;
permettant de faire face aux risques majeurs de la maladie.&#13;
4.3.1. Remettre en dtatfonctionnel les infrastructures actuelles&#13;
Les programmes de rehabilitation actuellement lances ne concernent que la&#13;
moitie, environ, du patrimoine sanitaire public. L'amelioration de I'accessibilite&#13;
geographique aux soins et de la qualite de ces demiers d6pend directement de la&#13;
generalisation de l'op&amp;ration. L'experience acquise dans les premieres&#13;
operations (procedures, normes...) devrait permettre d'accelerer l'execution des&#13;
prochaines realisations.&#13;
Une operation d'une telle envergure est a doubler de la mise en oeuvre&#13;
effective d'un processus d'entretien des batiments et de maintenance des&#13;
equipements, aide dans ce sens par la disponibilite de cadres techniques&#13;
(ingenieurs et techniciens biomedicaux) recemment formes a cet effet. Des&#13;
normes et standards d'entretien et de maintenance seront elabores pour chaque&#13;
categorie d'equipement et des programmes pluri annuels seront etablis et pris en&#13;
compte dans les budgets.&#13;

4.3.2. Densifier le reseau d 'etablissements sanitaires&#13;
La reduction des disparites dans l'accessibilite geographique est A&#13;
rechercher dans les zones rurales les plus peripheriques.&#13;
Elle doit aussi concerner les zones periurbaines de plus en plus peupl6es et&#13;
dont le niveau de vie des populations est particulierement faible. La lutte contre&#13;
la pauvrete passe par le desenclavement sanitaire des quartiers spontanes,&#13;
tant par la mise a la disposition de leur population d'infrastructures de base que&#13;
par la conduite de programmes sanitaires adaptes aux situations rencontrees.&#13;
Cette extension du reseau sera guidee par les resultats de la carte&#13;
sanitaire pour d6terminer les implantations optimales.&#13;
D'ici 2005, seront ainsi construits 350 dispensaires et 450 maternites&#13;
amenant les ratios de couverture en milieu rural A un dispensaire pour un&#13;
peu moias de 10.000 habitants (maintien du ratio actuel) et une maternite&#13;
pour 6.600 femmes en 'age de procreer. L'adoption du concept de centre de&#13;
sante integre comprenant un service dispensaire et un service matemite&#13;
dimensionn6s pour ces bassins de desserte et animes par du personnel&#13;
paramrdical plus polyvalent, permettra des economies dans les investissements et&#13;
ie fonctionnement, tout en rapprochant sensiblement les populations d'un point&#13;
d'entree dans le systeme sanitaire. En termes d'accessibilite geographique, ces&#13;
nouvelles infrastructures permettront a 80 % de la population de vivre dans&#13;
une localite disposant d'une formation sanitaire. De ce fait, seulement 10 %&#13;
de la population se trouvera a moins de 5 kilometres et 10 autres entre 5 et&#13;
10 kilometres d'une formation sanitaire.&#13;
4.3.3. Rendre disponibles et accessibles les medicaments&#13;
essentiels&#13;
Dans le secteur public, il convient d'asseoir definitivement la securite de la&#13;
disponibilite retrouvee des medicaments essentiels accessibles a tous dans les&#13;
formations  sanitaires  publiques.  La  regularite  et  la  fiabilite  des&#13;
approvisionnements des formations les plus peripheriques sera renforcee par&#13;
les resultats de la restructuration recente de la Pharmacie de la Sante Publique&#13;
(PSP) et par l'adoption de modes de gestion plus econoiniques.&#13;
A la suite du changement de parite du Franc CFA et du reajustement des&#13;
prix des medicaments, l'accessibilite economique aux medicaments essentiels sera&#13;
preservee en poursuivant une politique plus determinee d'approvisionnement&#13;
en medicaments generiques de bonne qualite dont la proportion en volume&#13;
des commandes devra representer rapidement au moins 50 % du volume&#13;
actuel, grace a 1'enregistrement de nombreux produits de type generique en 1994&#13;
et 1995.&#13;

Dans le secteur prive, la promotion d'une large penetration des produits&#13;
generiques de qualite a ete rendue possible a la fois par la r6forme de la&#13;
reglementation des autorisations de mise sur le marche et par la mise en oeuvre&#13;
effective de la possibilite legale de la substitution accord6e aux pharmaciens. La&#13;
formation et la participation active des prescripteurs et des professionnels&#13;
de la filiere pharmaceutique sera intensifiee pour atteindre une consommation&#13;
de l'ordre de 50 % en produits gen6riques. L'accessibilite 6conomique aux soins&#13;
en depend directement.&#13;
De plus, l'industrie pharmaceutique nationale sera developpee, faisant&#13;
passer le taux de production nationale de 5 % de la consommation a environ&#13;
20%.&#13;
4.3.4. Promouvoir un systeme d'assurance maladie&#13;
L'initiation d'une couverture sociale du risque maladie est une consequence&#13;
directe de la generalisation du recouvrement des coQts des actes de sante ains5&#13;
que l'objectif de promouvoir les activites du secteur sanitaire prive qui est&#13;
conditionnee par l'emergence d'une demande solvable plus nombreuse.&#13;
Mesurant les risques de l'entreprise, la demarche sera prudente et&#13;
progressive.&#13;
Prudente, car Iltat se veut avant tout promoteur d'un systeme dans lequel&#13;
la responsabilite des beneficiaires sera pleinement engagee a partir d'une&#13;
organisation de type mutualiste a assise locale, puis f6derative de proche en&#13;
proche.&#13;
Progressive, car l'initiative fera l'objet d'une phase d'essai, grice a la&#13;
programmation d'experiences pilotes, n6cessaire pour assurer tous les moyens de&#13;
controle et de maitrise de son developpement ulterieur.&#13;
Concemant avant tout les prestations de base, le secteur priv6 des&#13;
assurances sera appek a participer a la couverture compl6mentaire qui&#13;
demeurera facultative.&#13;
4.4. Ameliorer la gestion du systeme sanitaire&#13;
Les efforts significatifs enregistres dans la reallocation des ressources et&#13;
dans la creation d'outils de gestion sont a poursuivre, pour atteindre une mattrise&#13;
suffisante aux niveaux (i) de son fonctionnement, plus particulierement dans la&#13;
maitrise des cofits et (ii) de son developpement, notamment dans la maitrise des&#13;
programmes et des investissements. n1 s'agit aussi bien de la planification, de la&#13;
programmation, que de la budgetisation et de son suivi.&#13;

ANNEX2&#13;
Les recommandations contenues dans la revue des depenses publiques&#13;
seront systematiquement exploitees. En particulier,&#13;
- concemant le processus de budgetisation, (i) des normes de calcul&#13;
d'allocation de credit en fonction des activites seront definies et appliquees des le&#13;
budget 1997, qui sera prepare a partir des besoins exprimes par les structures&#13;
sanitaires, (ii) la nomenclature de presentation des investissements sera revis6e&#13;
afin de refleter les activites du Plan National de Developpement Sanitaire.&#13;
- concemant la planification, la creation d'une structure specifique et la&#13;
mise en ceuvre courant 1996 de la carte sanitaire perrnettront de maitriser le&#13;
developpement du systeme sanitaire national, dans ses infrastructures et ses&#13;
activites.&#13;
- concemant la gestion des Ressources Humaines, la mise a jour du fichier&#13;
central en 1996 ainsi que la mise en ceuvre d'un logiciel de gestion permettront&#13;
une meilleure repartition des effectifs actuels et une determination precise des&#13;
besoins.&#13;
- globalement, la competence gestionnaire des services du Ministere de la&#13;
Sante Publique sera renforcee de maniere a pouvoir etablir un veritable dialogue&#13;
technique avec les services des Finances et de la Fonction Publique.&#13;
L'avenement d'une culture gestionnaire dans le domaine de la sante&#13;
passe par l'adoption d'tune gestion par objectifs qui postule la disponibilite d'un&#13;
systeme d'informations sanitaires performant, d'outils de gestion et d'indicateurs&#13;
de performance pour mesurer les niveaux d'activites en les rapprochant des&#13;
moyens mis en oeuvre. La creation d'une structure specifique chargee du contr6le&#13;
et de 1'evaluation de toutes les activites du Ministere permettra de mettre en&#13;
ceuvre cette gestion par objectif.&#13;
Dans le meme sens, seront etroitement relies les implications du&#13;
daveloppement du systeme sanitaire national et le contexte offert par le cadre&#13;
macro economique, qui bien qu'oriente vers la croissance, necessite une&#13;
surveillance constante. Les efforts enregistres pour maintenir la masse salariale&#13;
dans des proportions acceptables pour le financement des autres inputs seront&#13;
poursuivis, en assurant des arbitrages pour les types d'emploi les plus productifs&#13;
sur le plan de la sante publique.&#13;
Enfin, toujours dans l'objectif de promouvoir les activites presentant les&#13;
meilleurs ratios cout efficacite, les ressources allouees au secteur primaire seront&#13;
privilegiees par rapport aux autres secteurs, notamment le tertiaire pour lequel les&#13;
efforts de rationalisation du fonctionnement seront poursuivis et les etudes pour&#13;
un plus large financement des usagers seront entreprises.&#13;
Le systeme d'informations sanitaires sera consolide en (i) ameliorant la&#13;
fiabilite et la rapidite des donnees, (ii) mettant au point une serie d'indicateurs&#13;
pertinents, tant sur le plan epidemiologique que sur celui des activites et (iii)&#13;

organisant une retro informnation tres large permettant d'utiliser ces donnees dans&#13;
le processus d'elaboration des plans d'actions, leur budgetisation et leur&#13;
evaluation.&#13;
Ce systeme d'information alimentera, A son tour, le dispositif de la carte&#13;
sanitaire qui guidera les decisions relatives (i) au developpement des&#13;
infrastructures en corrigeant les disparites, (ii) A la meilleure allocation des&#13;
ressources de fonctionnement en fonction des activites reelles des services et (iii)&#13;
A la mise en cuvre d'activites mieux ciblees sur les specificites epidemiologiques&#13;
locales.&#13;
Dans un contexte financier caracterise par la disponibilite de ressources&#13;
multiples provenant du budget de l'Etat, des usagers et des contributions&#13;
exterieures, leur utilisation optimale sera recherchee par une approche&#13;
comptable consolidee des differentes sources et par une integration effective&#13;
de I'aide internationale au schema de financement. Une attention&#13;
particuliere sera apportee a I'amelioration du rendement du recouvrement&#13;
des cofits des actes de sante et a son utilisation rationnelle dans le cadre de la&#13;
mise en ceuvre du Paquet Minimum d'Activites.&#13;
Dans le souci de maitriser et d'accroitre les ressources du systeme, seront&#13;
mis en ceuvre: (i) le developpement des comptes nationaux de la sante qui&#13;
permettront d'etablir un tableau general du financement du systeme sanitaire&#13;
national mettant en exergue la repartition des charges entre tous ses acteurs, ainsi&#13;
que la verification des grands equilibres necessaires A son bon fonctionnement,&#13;
(ii) de nouveaux mecanismes et moyens de mobilisation des ressources&#13;
financieres des menages pour la sante par la voie d'une plus grande utilisation de&#13;
l'assurance privee, notamment en ce qui concerne l'acces aux prestations&#13;
sanitaires non comprises dans le PMA, et, enfin, (iii) de systemes plus elabores&#13;
de ciblage des fonds publics en faveur des populations les plus pauvres.&#13;
L'animation et la coordination des grands programmes de sante au niveau&#13;
de leur application locale ainsi que le contr6le rapproche effectif du&#13;
fonctionnement des etablissements sanitaires trop souvent livres A eux-memes ne&#13;
seront obtenues que par une deconcentration effective des responsabilites et&#13;
des moyens au niveau des directions regionales et des directions&#13;
departementales (districts sanitaires). En effet, du rapprochement entre&#13;
l'administration de la Sante et les usagers et du dialogue permanent et transparent&#13;
entre ces partenaires depend l'adh&amp;sion des populations aux differents&#13;
programmes de sante. Pour aider le mouvement, un cadre juridique precis sera&#13;
elabore pour consacrer les delegations de responsabilites A ces differents niveaux.&#13;
4.5. Developper et utiliser optimalement les ressources humaines&#13;

La promotion des personnels de la sante est conditionnee par l'elaboration&#13;
et la mise en cuvre d'une veritable politique des personnels oeuvrant dans le&#13;
systeme sanitaire national.&#13;
Elle devra concemer les aspects quantitatifs et qualitatifs.&#13;
Quantitativement, il s'agira de maitriser les effectifs en service afin de&#13;
veiller a une bonne repartition spatiale et technique des agents a court et a long&#13;
terme dans l'ensemble du systeme sanitaire national. Cela impliquera, non&#13;
seulement un effort gestionnaire, mais aussi un partenariat veritable avec les&#13;
organisations professionnelles.&#13;
Qualitativement, il s'agira de repenser les formations professionnelles&#13;
initiales et continues en fonction des besoins, notamment en revisant les&#13;
curricula des formations dans le cadre du Paquet Minimum d'Activites.&#13;
Parallelement, sera initie un processus visant a modifier le comportement des&#13;
agents vis-a-vis des usagers (accueil, prise en charge psychologique, assiduit&amp;....)&#13;
par des mecanismes touchant a la motivation des personnels et de valorisation des&#13;
activites, mais aussi a l'evaluation et au contr6le rapproche du fonctionnement&#13;
des etablissements. La nouvelle approche de gestion du systeme par la demande&#13;
devrait contribuer a cette mutation.&#13;
4.6. Promouvoir la recherche.&#13;
La realite des effets de la recherche sur l'organisation sanitaire est&#13;
incontestable, tant ses resultats sont palpables et significatifs, aussi bien dans le&#13;
domaine medical que pharmaceutique moderne ou traditionnel. Malgre ses&#13;
r6sultats indeniables, force est de constater que la recherche sur l'organisation&#13;
sanitaire n'est pas suffisamnment valorisee et prise en compte sur le terrain.&#13;
Ainsi le nouveau schema de developpement du systeme sanitaire exige&#13;
qu'une place preponderante soit accordee a la recherche dans le but de&#13;
favoriser la connaissance de l'epidemiologie du pays et de proposer des&#13;
solutions novatrices quant a la prise en charge des malades, a la technologie&#13;
biomedicale, a l'identification des prophylaxies appropriees, a l'organisation&#13;
sanitaire, a la definition des politiques sanitaires conformement aux valeurs&#13;
socioculturelles et morales du pays.&#13;
Les efforts engages a l'occasion de la preparation (PPF) du Programmne de&#13;
Developpement des Services Sanitaires Integres offrent un cadre ideal pour&#13;
developper un veritable programme d'etudes et de recherches-actions oriente&#13;
vers la promotion des mutations fonctionnelles et des changements&#13;
institutionnels prevus par le Plan National de Developpement Sanitaire.&#13;

Trois axes de developpement de la recherche ont ete retenus: les sciences&#13;
de la sante, les sciences sociales et les sciences de la gestion dans le but de&#13;
promouvoir I'approche des problemes adoptee dans le cadre du PVRH:&#13;
planification, programmation, budgetisation  et suivi (PPBS). Dans cette&#13;
perspective, 1'economie de la sante, la sociologie et l'anthropologie medicales, la&#13;
gestion du risque et de l'innovation, tout comme la recherche medicale et&#13;
pharmaceutique en constituent les pieces maitresses.&#13;
En definitive, il convient d'indiquer que la definition de ce programme est&#13;
l'aboutissement d'un processus tres large de concertation et de dialogue&#13;
instaure entre les principales administrations nationales et la plupart des&#13;
bailleurs de fonds exterieurs a l'occasion de la preparation du Programme&#13;

Expression de la volonte du Gouvemement ivoirien de continuer a placer&#13;
I'homme au centre de ses preoccupations, au moment ou son environnement&#13;

developpement du Pays dans le cadre de I'amelioration des conditions de vie de&#13;
ses populations et plus particulierement dans celui d'une meilleure sante pour&#13;
tous les ivoiriens.&#13;
La presente Lettre de Politique constitue un cadre de reference des&#13;
actions de l'Etat dans lequel s'inscriront les interventions des partenaires&#13;
ext6rieurs (organismes intemationaux de financement du developpement,&#13;
institutions du systeme des Nations Unies, pays amis, etc...) dont le concours sera&#13;
sollicite au cours d'une prochaine Table Ronde des Bailleurs de Fonds, pour la&#13;
mise en oeuvre des mesures qu'elle implique. Celles-ci sont esquissees dans les&#13;

REPUBLIC OF COTE D'IVOIRE&#13;
INTEGRATED HEALTH SERVICES&#13;
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
INDICATORS FOR MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
This annex sets out the planned global indicators for monitoring and evaluation of&#13;
the Integrated Health Services Development Project. It is the beginning of an operational&#13;
monitoring and evaluation program.  The program  should encompass both global&#13;
indicators, and more detailed indicators, which should be monitored by those responsible&#13;
for executing the specific components. The global indicators were confirmed during&#13;
negotiations on the proposed IDA Credit. The next step is for the Cote d'lvoire Project&#13;
Coordinator and those responsible for Project execution to give each global indicator&#13;
firther precision, to review the proposed detailed indicators (see the Appendix to this&#13;
Annex for proposals), to determine the periodicity of collecting new data, to decide on the&#13;
operational modalities for data collection, and to initiate collection - where necessary - of&#13;
additional base-line data. These tasks need to be completed before project execution can&#13;
effectively begin, and consultant assistance to the MSP is planned in this area. The final,&#13;
operational version of the monitoring and evaluation program, including particularly the&#13;
component-specific indicators, should be included in the project execution manual to be&#13;
completed as a condition of Credit effectiveness.&#13;
Inputs/process&#13;
I.    Timely disbursement of Project fimds from the Government and IDA.&#13;
2.    Timely recruitment, and retention, of quality staff hired for Project execution at all&#13;
levels.&#13;
3.    Timely procurement of goods and services financed by IDA and the Government.&#13;
4.    Quarterly letter to stakeholders on the progress and problems of the Project.&#13;
5.    Annual feedback from  executing authorities on support from  the Project&#13;
Coordinator and other central staff with baseline to be established following&#13;
launch workshop.&#13;
6.    Satisfactory annual Project work program preparation and review process and&#13;
results.&#13;
&#13;

3.    Increased availability and improved utilization of reproductive health services.&#13;
4.    Strengthened management systems, for budgets, for financial flows and accounts,&#13;
for human resources planning and management, for overall planning and&#13;
information management, for internal and external communication with EEC.&#13;
5.    MSP budgets and expenditure growing in real per capita terms, with particular&#13;
reference to (a) PMA and health district development plans, (b) non-salary&#13;
recurrent inputs, with an updated and agreed set of monitoring indicators in active&#13;
and common use by the MSP and the Ministry of the Economy and Finance.&#13;

SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
1.     The Integrated Health Services Development Project touches on so many different&#13;
aspects of health services, and has such a large volume of studies, training and technical&#13;

arrangements have been made to pre-program trust fund resources to complement the Bank's&#13;
allocation of budget resources for supervision.&#13;

            Services Development Project

        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Integrated Health
            Services Development Project, within the framework of the
            government's National Health Development Plan, are to:
            1) expand access to health services and improve their
            utilization; 2) make health services available on a
            sustainable basis; and 3) improve the ability of the
            Ministry of Public Health (MSP) to analyze health problems,
            and to formulate, monitor and evaluate policies, strategies
            and programs. The project components are as follows: 1) the
            minimum package of health services (PMA); 2) reproductive
            health; 3) health planning and management; and 4)
            information and health. The first two components - service
            delivery - include the following: (a) investment and
            start-up costs for PMA introduction in about 14 districts,
            including nutrition, pharmaceuticals, training, reproductive
            health, and information, education and communication
            services; and (b) an accelerated program of reproductive
            health services, including family planning and sexually
            transmitted diseases. The last two components -
            institutional strengthening activities - cover the following
            areas: (a) organization development of the MSP; 2)
            information systems, including epidemiological surveillance
            and continuous monitoring and feedback of user perspectives
            on services; 3) training of prescribers in use of generic
            drugs and strengthening of quality control laboratory
            services; 4) health care financing; 5) financial management;
            and 6) review of training programs and strengthening of
            personnel management.
