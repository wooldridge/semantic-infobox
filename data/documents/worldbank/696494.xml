1. EDUCATION ISSUES AND STRATEGY&#13;
A.  BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1    Over the last 25 years, the Government of Indonesia has demonstrated a strong&#13;
commitment to education and as a result, Indonesia has achieved one of the best rates of&#13;
educational transition in the world. The Government-led enrollment drive and substantial school&#13;
building program in the 1970s sharply increased primary school enrollment. The gross enrollment&#13;
rate stood at 75 percent in the early 1970s but had increased to about 90 percent by the end of that&#13;
decade. By the mid-1980s, gross enrollment rates exceeded 100 percent and by 1994/95 had&#13;
reached 112 percent. The effort is not complete because of quality concerns and the need to&#13;
increase retention rates, but the achievements at the primary level have been substantial in this&#13;
diverse and far-flung archipelago. (Annexes 1-6 provide basic data on the educational structure&#13;
and administration in Indonesia.)&#13;
1.2   The Government of Indonesia (GOI) is looking to future needs, and has reiterated its&#13;
commitment to a proactive program in the future with expansion of junior secondary education as&#13;
a priority. While maintaining its commitment to primary education, the Government is aiming for&#13;
universal basic education (years 1-9) by 2008/09, to meet the human resource requirements for&#13;
transforming the economy from one based on natural resources to one based more on industry&#13;
and technology.&#13;
1.3   The decision to expand junior secondary education participation as rapidly as feasible is&#13;
justified for several reasons (see Annex 7). First, expansion appears to be a precondition for the&#13;
rapid growth of the Indonesian economy in the medium term.  Recent research on the&#13;
development of East Asian economies indicates that with the achievement of near universal&#13;
primary education, secondary (junior and senior) education has had a strong impact on economic&#13;
growth. Secondary education plays the role of providing educated entrants to the labor force,&#13;
enhancing the trainability of workers, and providing qualified inputs into higher levels of&#13;
education.&#13;
1.4   In this regard, the Indonesian economy and labor market are in the midst of a structural&#13;
transformation. Since 1990, there has been a marked slow-down in employment creation in&#13;
agriculture and an acceleration in the rate of growth of job creation in manufacturing,&#13;
construction, transport and communication. After a period of wage stagnation in the 1980s, there&#13;
are strong indications of rising real wage rates throughout the country and an absolute decline of&#13;
employment in agriculture. If sustained nationally for a decade or so, these trends imply the&#13;
absorption of remaining pockets of surplus labor, and as happened in other NICs, the&#13;
transformation from an agrarian economy to one relying on the education and productivity of its&#13;
workers. Social rates of return to education computed from 1986-92 indicate that returns to junior&#13;
secondary education are the highest among the education subsectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                 Central Indonesia Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
1.5    The second justification for significant Government attention to junior secondary&#13;
education is that the number of school places is still limited relative to demand, despite&#13;
substantial outlays by parents and a significant private sector response. This inadequacy is&#13;
evident from continued strong demand for generally more costly and often lower quality private&#13;
education, large numbers of unsuccessful applicants to schools, the prevalence of double shifts&#13;
and large classes in schools, and the use of libraries and laboratories for classroom teaching.&#13;
1.6    A third rationale for Government intervention is to assist in removing barriers of cost and&#13;
isolation that keep many of the rural poor out of school. In rural Java, for example, total expen-&#13;
diture per junior secondary student is equivalent to approximately 86 percent of per capita&#13;
household expenditure for households of the lowest quintile. Junior secondary education is&#13;
therefore beyond the reach of many of the poor and near poor. The opportunity costs of keeping&#13;
children in school exacerbate the problem. Expansion of junior secondary education in the&#13;
remote rural areas -- which will be the main areas of focus because of their very low enrollment&#13;
rates -- will be of direct benefit to the poor, especially girls who are sometimes disadvantaged in&#13;
these areas.&#13;
1.7    A fourth rationale relates to likely externalities associated with investments in secondary&#13;
education. Research from other countries has pointed to externalities such as reduced fertility and&#13;
child mortality and improved nutritional status that correlate with female secondary education.&#13;
For Indonesia, survey results indicate that a mother's education is an important determinant of&#13;
prenatal care utilization: more than 90 percent of women with junior secondary education use&#13;
prenatal care, in contrast to only 75 percent of women with some primary education.&#13;
Furthermore, analysis of nutritional status in Indonesia finds a strong effect of maternal education&#13;
on children's nutritional status: for women with between zero and five years of education, an&#13;
additional year of education has no impact on the child's nutritional status, while among women&#13;
with six to twelve years of education (or more), an additional year of education improves&#13;
nutritional status significantly.&#13;
1.8    The role of the Government would therefore be to (a) help expand the number of school&#13;
places through a combination of direct investment and measures to stimulate further private&#13;
sector/community participation in the provision of school places, and (b) ensure that the poor are&#13;
given increased opportunity to participate in the expansion process.&#13;
Sector Financing Plan&#13;
1.9    Achieving universal nine-year basic education will require significant additional public&#13;
resources to be directed to the education sector overall and to basic education in particular.&#13;
Estimates of the total costs of the junior secondary expansion program come to approximately&#13;
$7.6 billion to be phased out over a 15-year period (see Annex 7 for details). The cost estimates&#13;
assume that the private sector will maintain its share of total enrollment of about 40 percent.&#13;
During the next ten years of expansion, the budgetary shortfall is estimated at an average $120&#13;
million per annum. This is over and above additional resources generated by a 6 percent p.a.&#13;
growth of the budget. This implies that the budgetary allocation to junior secondary education&#13;
would need to increase from the current 13 percent of the education budget to approximately 16&#13;
percent in the next few years. Overall, Indonesia would need to increase its allocation to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                                  3&#13;
education as a proportion of GDP by approximately 0.2 percent (this does not take into account,&#13;
however, increases in other education subsectors, which may equally be required).&#13;
1.10   Government has demonstrated its commitment to expansion of junior secondary&#13;
education through increases in its education investments. In its most recent budget allocations&#13;
(1996/97) the education sector budget was increased by 20 percent, one of the highest increases&#13;
amongst all sectors. The budget for junior secondary education saw a 24 percent rise over last&#13;
year's budget allocation. GOI is also requesting help from donors to close the financing gap.&#13;
These efforts include proposed projects in junior secondary education in Indonesia for which&#13;
World Bank assistance will be sought over the next four to five fiscal years. The Central&#13;
Indonesia Junior Secondary Education Project covers four of the country's 27 provinces:&#13;
(a) Central Java (Jawa Tengah), (b) Central Kalimantan (Kalimantan Tengah), (c) West&#13;
Kalimantan (Kalimantan Barat), and (d) Yogyakarta (D.I. Yogyakarta). Other projects currently&#13;
under preparation are the East Java and East Nusa Tenggara Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
and the Sumatra Junior Secondary Education Project.   The Secondary  School Teacher&#13;
Development Project (Loan 3979-IND) and the Book and Reading Development Project (Loan&#13;
3887-IND) will complement these efforts, as well as future basic and secondary education&#13;
operations in other provinces. To promote efficiency and equity in the use of resources, the&#13;
Government has recognized that educational development among and within the provinces must&#13;
be balanced and appropriate to local conditions, meet an acceptable standard of quality, and take&#13;
advantage of lessons learned within and outside the country.&#13;

1.11   Although the Government can and should promote expansion at the junior secondary&#13;
level, it is also aware that Indonesia will not be able to reach universal basic education enrollment&#13;
until graduation rates improve at the primary level. Despite high gross enrollment rates at the&#13;
primary level overall, about 25 percent of pupils, especially in the more difficult remote areas, do&#13;
not complete the full six years of education. Universal nine-year education thus depends on&#13;
improving the efficiency of the primary system and producing an expanded pool of candidates for&#13;
junior secondary school. The Government has started addressing this issue through a series of&#13;
initiatives, including the Primary Education Quality Improvement Project (Loan 3448-IND)&#13;
which is piloting measures for improving education quality. Satisfying existing unmet demand,&#13;
even at current primary-to-junior-secondary transition rates during the project period, is seen as&#13;
an important objective. This will help satisfy communities that are lukewarm to primary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

education because of lack of opportunities for secondary education. The combined effects of&#13;
these measures would be to improve the transition rates and the potential for accelerating the&#13;
development of junior secondary education in the future.&#13;
Structure of the Education System&#13;
1.12   The education system in Indonesia consists of a six-year primary school cycle, junior and&#13;
senior secondary school cycles of three years each, and a postsecondary system ranging from one&#13;
to six years. Primary education is largely the domain of Government: nearly five out of six&#13;
pupils are enrolled in public schools. Private schooling plays a much greater role in secondary&#13;
education. Private schools account for 41 percent of enrollment in junior secondary education&#13;
and 54 percent in senior secondary. Junior secondary education is provided through 8,712 public&#13;
and 10,279 private general junior secondary schools (SMP) and a remaining 300 vocational&#13;
schools that emphasize either technical or home economics subjects, all of which are&#13;
administered by the Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC). The Ministry of Religious&#13;
Affairs administers the 582 public and 7,547 private Muslim schools (Madrasahs, or MTs) at the&#13;
junior secondary level. At the senior secondary level, 3,241 public and 10,380 private schools&#13;
enroll a total of 4.2 million students, for a gross enrollment rate of 34 percent. Education statistics&#13;
are found in Annex 8.&#13;
1.13   When a private junior secondary school is established, it is classified as "listed" and is&#13;
evaluated after graduating its first students. Private schools can advance in accreditation from&#13;
"registered" to "recognized" and finally to the status of "equivalent" to public schools. Most&#13;
equivalent schools are owned and operated by religious organizations or large enterprises.&#13;
Registered and recognized schools are in general owned and operated by teachers' associations&#13;
and other nonprofit organizations (yayasans), although some are owned  by religious&#13;
organizations or small communities. Most listed schools are owned and operated by small rural&#13;
communities that do not have a public school nearby. Almost invariably, schools established by&#13;
communities aspire to complete Government takeover, while private yayasans often prefer partial&#13;
Government support so they can maintain control. Schools established by teachers' associations&#13;
often use public school facilities after hours and employ public school teachers as instructors.&#13;
B.    SECTOR ISSUES AND NATIONAL INITIATIVES&#13;
1.14   The project provinces face challenges in the provision of junior secondary education that&#13;
are common to all provinces in Indonesia, though not to the same extent. These challenges are&#13;
(a) to expand equitable access to junior secondary education; (b) to improve the quality of&#13;
education throughout the provinces; and (c) to make education management more efficient as the&#13;
provinces assume increased responsibility. Access is restricted mainly by the lack of places; high&#13;
direct, transportation, and opportunity costs; and great distances and limited transportation&#13;
networks in some provinces. In some instances parents in very remote or difficult areas do not&#13;
express interest in junior secondary education as they think it is beyond their reach. The most&#13;
important factors affecting quality and internal efficiency are: teacher knowledge and skills; the&#13;
availability of textbooks, teaching materials, and equipment; the curriculum; pedagogical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                               5&#13;
supervision; the flexibility of the school calendar; school management; and examinations and&#13;
educational assessment.&#13;
1.15   In spite of these constraints to access and quality, Indonesia has made great strides in&#13;
gender equality in both primary and junior secondary education. Only slightly fewer girls than&#13;
boys are enrolled in school at the national level, and the rates for three of the project provinces&#13;
are higher than for Indonesia as a whole, and in the case of Central Java equal to the national&#13;
average. Girls also have lower drop-out and repeater rates than boys and are often higher&#13;
achievers. However, rural conditions similar to those which present obstacles to the development&#13;
of junior secondary education also adversely affect the participation of girls in some&#13;
communities. When schools are located a long way from villages, parents are less willing to let&#13;
their daughters commute long distances for religious or cultural reasons, or undertake the costly&#13;
expenditures of a long commute or relocation to urban areas. Consequently, boys in these&#13;
communities get to go to school rather than girls or go to the better schools often located away&#13;
from the remote villages. This happens particularly in certain remote areas of the Kalimantan&#13;
provinces.&#13;
1.16  In addition to access and quality, all provinces face management challenges as a result of&#13;
the deconcentration of tasks from the center to the provinces, a process this project will support.&#13;
For historical and political reasons, public administration in Indonesia has been highly centralized&#13;
and decision making is tightly controlled by central Government in Jakarta. The center has&#13;
traditionally set objectives for education expansion and development, with few inputs from the&#13;
provinces. However, the differences of local conditions in each province and district, accentuated&#13;
by the great distances of the outer islands from the administrative center, make it increasingly&#13;
difficult for central administration to devise and implement satisfactory solutions to local&#13;
problems. Although Jakarta will retain a significant role in providing policy guidelines and&#13;
promoting regional equity and overall economic development, the Government has decided&#13;
gradually to devolve authority to the provinces and districts. This devolution will result in a&#13;
deconcentration of the functions of the MOEC to provincial (Kanwil) and district (Kandep)&#13;
education offices.&#13;
Initiatives Related to Access&#13;
1.17   GOI is aware of these issues and a number of initiatives have been put in place to address&#13;
them. To improve access, the policy of establishing a minimum size of nine classrooms for&#13;
Government schools, which has prevented opening schools in small communities, is being&#13;
changed to make it easier for schools with fewer classrooms to be built. Most rural areas also find&#13;
it difficult to attract teachers, so the Government is planning to hire contract teachers for limited&#13;
terms.&#13;
1.18   To make up for some of the inadequacies of the public sector, private schools supported&#13;
by local communities, private educational foundations and religious groups have been established&#13;
and account for about 40 percent of total enrollment at the junior secondary level. GOI supports&#13;
these schools through a variety of measures, including provision of teachers, but compared to&#13;
public schools, they are generally of lower quality and cost more to parents. The low quality in&#13;
these schools is explained by poor quality teachers and even greater scarcity of educational&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6                 Central Indonesia Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
materials than in public schools. Unit costs of operations in these schools is, however, lower than&#13;
in public schools. Current and proposed GOI support for private education would help maintain&#13;
or increase its share of enrollment and improve quality.&#13;
1.19  In some sparsely populated areas some communities are not even large enough to support&#13;
smaller schools; students have to travel over long distances or difficult terrain to get to school, so&#13;
other alternatives are being implemented. The SMP Terbuka ("open SMP") program has been&#13;
established to meet the needs of students who cannot attend regular schools because of distance&#13;
or high direct and opportunity costs. These are non-fee-paying schools. and students attend&#13;
afternoon classes run by secondary school teachers one or more times a week at a center, usually&#13;
a junior secondary school, supplemented by tutorials in their villages. The effectiveness of these&#13;
schools have been in question because of scarcity of learning materials and inadequate&#13;
operational funds. As a result, student drop-out has been a serious problem in some areas.&#13;
1.20   To assist rural families who cannot afford to pay for education, GOI has established a&#13;
scholarship program for children of low economic background and satisfactory academic&#13;
achievement and personality.  This program  covers all costs related to junior secondary&#13;
education; within the eligible group priority is given to children from remote areas, orphans, and&#13;
girls. GOI plans to expand this program to improve its effectiveness. See Annex 10 for options&#13;
to increase access to junior secondary education.&#13;
Initiatives Related to Quality&#13;
1.21   Various initiatives have also been introduced to improve the quality of junior secondary&#13;
education, including efforts to bring good teachers to underserved areas. Although there is an&#13;
excess number of teachers in the aggregate, there is an unequal distribution of teachers between&#13;
urban and rural areas within provinces because most rural teaching positions are considered&#13;
undesirable. Soon after being appointed to rural areas, many teachers try to be placed into urban&#13;
schools or find excuses to be absent for long periods. To address this issue of shortages of&#13;
(particularly core subject) teachers in rural and remote areas, some provinces have experimented&#13;
with hiring "contract teachers" in rural schools in core academic areas. Some rural communities&#13;
have also provided their teachers with dormitories. In addition, the Government is already&#13;
providing some financial compensation for service in hardship areas. Over the longer term, local&#13;
recruitment is one practice that will help to keep teachers in rural areas.&#13;
1.22   The unequal distribution of teachers has rather different consequences in the urban areas&#13;
where many teachers are underutilized, and where there is a perception of high levels of&#13;
absenteeism. Financial rewards may not be the only answer. Teachers generally spend only a&#13;
limited time in school because of the very few hours they are assigned to teach, the lack of&#13;
teacher rooms, inadequate supplies of library, reference and teaching materials, and the absence&#13;
of a structure which promotes interaction among teachers in schools. Management is therefore&#13;
focused on purely administrative issues rather than the educational process. And the opportunity&#13;
to promote improved teaching in the various subjects is lost. Commitment to outside activities is&#13;
therefore sometimes greater than to teaching. Teachers recognize this gap and have effectively&#13;
organized monthly subject teacher meetings as a part of their associations (MGMP) outside the&#13;
school system. Similar groups are to be encouraged in schools, to help motivate teachers. These&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                               7&#13;
groups would gradually be institutionalized as subject departments within which teachers would&#13;
take collective responsibility for effective teaching of a given subject. This initiative, combined&#13;
with efforts to reduce the over-supply of teachers and to provide teacher rooms and better&#13;
libraries in schools, should increase teacher effectiveness.&#13;
1.23   Developed from an initiative taken by the MGMP teacher associations, an inservice&#13;
teacher training program called PKG was introduced in 1983 to improve the subject-matter&#13;
knowledge and skills of teachers (see Annex 11 for details). This program was highly successful&#13;
in improving the pedagogical skills of teachers in the selected subject areas and created a positive&#13;
attitude among teachers where it was provided. There were, however, some serious shortcomings&#13;
of the program. The training curriculum did not fully address the subject-matter knowledge of&#13;
teachers, development of skills in identifying learning difficulties was neglected, and teachers in&#13;
rural areas could not be covered because of high costs and logistical difficulties. Training was&#13;
provided every weekend followed by classroom visits, and trainees were supposed to develop&#13;
their own materials. Some of the rural teachers who could be reached could not take full&#13;
advantage of the program because of weak qualifications. The decentralization of the PKG and&#13;
MGMP system to the district level and the systematic involvement of regional MOEC staff,&#13;
including supervisors and principals in the training program, would help address this issue.&#13;
1.24   Providing incentives to teachers to spend more time on teaching and reduce absenteeism&#13;
also needs to be considered. The costs of this can be high, however, as a general salary increase&#13;
for all educational staff would have large fiscal implications on the overall civil service wage bill.&#13;
Hence, specific teaching hour supplements that are phased in and linked to performance may be&#13;
introduced if an efficient management system for this can be developed.&#13;
1.25   Efforts to provide schools with science equipment have not been completely successful.&#13;
Procurement and distribution of equipment from Jakarta has resulted in difficult distribution&#13;
problems and the supply of inappropriate equipment to schools. Changes in the provision of&#13;
science equipment and other school materials are being piloted in the ongoing Second Secondary&#13;
Education and Management Project (Loan 3158-IND), including requiring suppliers to distribute&#13;
equipment directly to schools as part of their contracts.&#13;
1.26   The public examinations and testing system also has been improved under the Second&#13;
Secondary Education and Management Project, but the process still needs to be completed. While&#13;
preparation of test items for multiple-choice examinations have been greatly improved,&#13;
development of open-ended and essay type questions still need to be addressed, and adequate&#13;
mechanisms for objective scoring and analysis of results are only now being put in place.&#13;
Through the same project, a national assessment system is being established to monitor the&#13;
performance of the system regularly. Parallel with the development of the public system the&#13;
quality of tests and identification of learning weaknesses in schools has also been initiated so that&#13;
educational problems in individual schools can be addressed. A combination of the development&#13;
of the public and private systems would provide teachers and managers with the required&#13;
information for planning development of the system.&#13;

8                  Central Indonesia Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
C.  JUNIOR SECONDARY EDUCATION IN THE PROVINCES&#13;
1.27   The issues constraining further development of junior secondary education affect the four&#13;
project provinces in significantly different ways, and they have developed their education&#13;
strategies in response to local circumstances, needs, and opportunities. Central Java's developing&#13;
economy can absorb a high rate of growth in junior secondary education but is constrained by&#13;
rural conditions and a rate of poverty that is higher than the national average. The two&#13;
Kalimantan provinces are held back by geography and poverty, but the need for expansion is less&#13;
urgent, particularly in Central Kalimantan where opportunities for junior secondary school&#13;
graduates are fewer and the pool of primary graduates is limited. Yogyakarta has already made&#13;
substantial progress in expanding access to junior secondary education, so it is focusing its efforts&#13;
on traditional and new measures to improve quality. Private schools have been remarkably&#13;
successful in providing places for over 40 percent of students in three of the provinces, but at&#13;
tremendous cost to parents. While Central Java has a relatively robust network of private schools&#13;
in some areas, most such schools in rural Kalimantan are struggling to survive among poor,&#13;
scattered villages, where the public sector's help is more crucial. In Central Kalimantan the role&#13;
of the private sector is restricted (30 percent of enrollments) because conditions are less&#13;
conducive for its development. Because of the diverse conditions in the project provinces, a&#13;
variety of instruments would be used as appropriate to increase access and improve the quality of&#13;
secondary education.&#13;

Central Java&#13;
1.28   Socioeconomic Background. Central Java is densely populated, rural, and poor, but is&#13;
changing rapidly. Although small in area, Central Java is the third largest province in Indonesia&#13;
with about 30 million inhabitants. The population aged 13-15 peaked in 1993 at just over 2&#13;
million and is projected to continue declining throughout the project period. About 70 percent of&#13;
the population lives in rural areas, compared to 78 percent in 1980. Central Java has 20 percent of&#13;
the country's population living in poverty: over 7 million people had income levels below the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                               9&#13;
poverty line in 1990. The province is below the average for Indonesia in household income and&#13;
per capita expenditure, and is the second lowest of the four project provinces. However, per&#13;
capita GDP growth (6 percent) was higher than the Indonesian average (4.8 percent) from 1983-&#13;
1993.&#13;
1.29   The province's employed labor force is still concentrated in agriculture (40 percent in&#13;
1994), although the importance of the sector has fallen sharply (from 48 percent in 1987) as&#13;
people shift into urban occupations. Urbanization and continued GDP growth have created a&#13;
demand for increasing numbers of educated workers -- this is reflected in the wage premiums&#13;
enjoyed by more educated wage earners. In 1992, employees with only primary education&#13;
received an average monthly wage of about Rp 69,000, those with junior secondary education&#13;
earned 27 percent more, those with senior secondary education earned 56 percent more than&#13;
junior secondary education graduates, and those with tertiary education earned 52 percent more&#13;
than senior secondary graduates.&#13;
1.30   Education System. Central Java enrolls 4.5 million primary school pupils in about&#13;
26,000 schools and accounts for 15 percent of the nation's primary enrollment. The province's&#13;
gross enrollment rate is 114 percent at the primary level, compared to a junior secondary rate of&#13;
62 percent. The system enrolls 1.3 million junior secondary school students, compared to&#13;
340,000 in the other three provinces combined. As in all the project provinces, private schooling&#13;
is crucial in helping to fill the gap between demand and supply. About 42 percent of the&#13;
province's students attend private junior secondary schools, and there are twice as many private&#13;
schools as public schools. Most of these private schools are small (about a third the size of the&#13;
average public school) but relatively well-established, 80 percent having reached the&#13;
"recognized" or "equivalent" level of accreditation. The private sector plays an even greater role&#13;
at the senior secondary level, where it accounts for 60 percent of the total enrollment of 600,000&#13;
and 72 percent of the schools. The senior secondary gross enrollment rate in Central Java is 32&#13;
percent, slightly lower than the national rate.&#13;
1.31   Subsector Issues. The scale of Central Java's education system is enormous and presents&#13;
the greatest challenges, in terms of absolute numbers, of any of the project provinces. Access to&#13;
junior secondary education is highly variable throughout the province, based on income levels,&#13;
and urban or rural living. Gross enrollment rates range from 42 percent to 109 percent by district.&#13;
The rural enrollment rate is 46 percent compared to an urban rate of 77 percent. Of the 35&#13;
districts, eight account for half of the province's 13-15 age population not attending school. The&#13;
provincial enrollment rate improved from 1992/93 to 1994/95 as junior secondary enrollment&#13;
expanded even as the cohort population began to level off. Still, large numbers are not in school.&#13;
A total of 775,000 youth of the appropriate age are not attending junior secondary school, and&#13;
each year more than 160,000 pupils graduate from primary school but do not continue their&#13;
studies.&#13;
1.32   Access is restricted in Central Java, particularly in rural areas, mainly because capacity is&#13;
limited and because direct and opportunity costs are high. Public and private schools have&#13;
expanded their enrollment rapidly to meet demand for school places, especially in cities and in&#13;
other areas that are easy to reach. For example, private school enrollment increased by 26&#13;
percent over two years, 1992/93-1994/95. The number of students per classroom averages 46, so&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10                Central Indonesia Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
specialized teaching classrooms such as laboratories and libraries often get used as regular&#13;
classrooms to house the overflow of students. In addition, teachers favor urban schools while&#13;
rural schools often do not have enough qualified staff. In rural low-income areas, many parents&#13;
are hindered by high costs, even when places are available. Aside from the opportunity costs of&#13;
sending children to school during working hours, rural households devote an exceptionally high&#13;
share of their expenditure to junior secondary education, as noted earlier. Even in those rural&#13;
areas where public transportation is available, the cost of a two-way trip every day contributes to&#13;
these expenses and is probably prohibitive for low-income families.&#13;
1.33   The quality of education is also a concern, particularly in rural schools. Low quality&#13;
reduces the interest of students and parents and leads to inefficiencies in the system as students&#13;
score poorly on examinations, drop out, or repeat grades. Quality is particularly affected by the&#13;
skills of teachers and the availability of instructional tools and facilities. Teachers need ongoing&#13;
support and training because many are teaching with a weak educational background. Two-thirds&#13;
of the province's SMP teachers do not have the required level of qualification, and 12 percent&#13;
have no more than a secondary education (this rises to one third among Madrasah teachers). Only&#13;
one teacher in five has received ongoing training and support under the current inservice program&#13;
(PKG). Private schools tend to rely heavily on less-qualified part-time teachers. Whereas only 14&#13;
percent of the public school teachers are part-time, the ratio is 55 percent in private schools.&#13;
1.34   In addition, the facilities and teaching tools that teachers have to work with are limited.&#13;
Among SMPs, which are generally better equipped than Madrasahs, 68 percent have little or no&#13;
science teaching equipment. A third of the schools have no library, and many that do have few&#13;
books. On average, school libraries have about two books per student; many of those are extra&#13;
copies of textbooks and teacher handbooks, or are out of date and of poor quality. Textbooks for&#13;
students have historically been limited, though this problem is being addressed through another&#13;
Bank project. Because of the province's poverty, limited parental contributions also affect&#13;
quality. Of family expenditure on junior secondary education, only 6 percent goes for textbooks,&#13;
compared to a national average of 13 percent.&#13;
1.35   Broad Subsector Strategy. To respond to the likely rise in demand for junior secondary&#13;
education in light of continuing industrial and urban development, GOI plans to aggressively&#13;
support equitable expansion of junior secondary education in Central Java, although near-&#13;
universal access cannot be achieved until a larger proportion of primary school pupils graduate&#13;
from that level. Several types of support are planned. First, the province will build schools in&#13;
and attract good teachers to areas of low enrollment, particularly larger rural settlements that the&#13;
private sector is not covering. Second, it will further support the strong tradition of private&#13;
schooling in this province by promoting quality improvement and more efficient administration,&#13;
so parents will see it as providing education of a standard similar to that of public schools. Third,&#13;
the province will alleviate financial constraints that keep the rural poor out of school, in part by&#13;
reducing travel costs and by providing flexible education alternatives that do not force young&#13;
people to choose between study and work. Fourth, improvement of the overall quality of&#13;
education, particularly in rural areas, will increase the trainability of junior secondary school&#13;
graduates from both public and private schools. Because of its large size and dense population,&#13;
Central Java's strategies for implementing quality improvements would be different from those of&#13;
the other provinces. For example, the inservice teacher training program strategy in the province&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                              11&#13;
would focus on decentralization to the district level, and greater support would be given to&#13;
MGMPs.&#13;
Yogyakarta&#13;
1.36   Socioeconomic Background. Yogyakarta, small in land area, is the most heavily&#13;
urbanized province in Indonesia, aside from Jakarta. Between 1980 and 1990, the urban&#13;
population grew at a rate of 8 percent per annum. Still, over 40 percent of the people live in rural&#13;
areas. Rapid urbanization has produced the lowest share of the labor force in agriculture (45&#13;
percent) among the four project provinces and the highest share in services (37 percent).&#13;
Furthermore, social development indicators such as school attendance are among the highest in&#13;
Indonesia. Yet GDP per capita is the lowest among the project provinces. High enrollment in&#13;
junior secondary school is reflected in reduced wage premiums for educated workers. In 1992,&#13;
the wage premium for workers with junior secondary education over those with primary&#13;
education was only 11 percent, but that for senior secondary graduates over those with junior&#13;
secondary education was 52 percent.&#13;
1.37   Education System.  Yogyakarta has been remarkably successful in expanding the&#13;
coverage of education. Of youth aged 10-19 years, 82 percent attend school and only 12 percent&#13;
are working. Yogyakarta's primary school system has 355,000 pupils and a gross enrollment rate&#13;
of 118 percent. About 80 percent of the primary schools are public, compared to 39 percent at&#13;
the junior secondary level. A majority of junior secondary students, however, attend public&#13;
schools rather than the smaller private schools. Yogyakarta and Jakarta are the two provinces that&#13;
are farthest ahead of the national average in coverage at the lower secondary level. Yogyakarta's&#13;
junior secondary system as a whole has a high gross enrollment rate of 89 percent. Most students&#13;
attend general SMPs: out of a total of 547 junior secondary schools, the number of vocational&#13;
schools in the province has dwindled to only three. Also, the role of Madrasahs, which are&#13;
generally of lower quality than SMPs, is less significant here than in the other project provinces&#13;
(they account for only 3 percent of all students). At the senior secondary level, the gross&#13;
enrollment rate is an impressive 62 percent, compared to the national rate of 34 percent. The&#13;
private system accounts for 76 percent of the senior secondary schools and 60 percent of the&#13;
students. Yogyakarta has a strong tradition of education as reflected in its high gross enrollment&#13;
rates even at the tertiary level - the highest in the country and more than three times the national&#13;
average.&#13;
1.38   Subsector Issues. As a result of Yogyakarta's high population density, access to junior&#13;
secondary schools is far less of a problem here than in the other project provinces. In Bantul and&#13;
Gunung Kidul districts, which are rural, enrollment rates are lower, partly because of school costs&#13;
and partly because some young people go to work or to school in the city. These districts account&#13;
for two-thirds of the province's out-of-school youth in the 13-15 age group. The relative quality&#13;
of the system is reflected in national examination scores, which are among the highest in the&#13;
country. Interest in education is high, and the secondary school system has been supported&#13;
through links with the tertiary institutions. The province as a whole, therefore, is aiming for&#13;
excellence, although parts of Yogyakarta are still limited by weaknesses in teaching and by&#13;
limited facilities and instructional tools. In general, Yogyakarta's private schools are relatively&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12               Central Indonesia Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
well developed, particularly in comparison to those in the Kalimantan provinces. Over 90&#13;
percent have reached the accreditation level of "recognized" or "equivalent".&#13;
1.39   Broad Subsector Strategy. By continuing to target remaining pockets with lower school&#13;
attendance, Yogyakarta can be expected to achieve near-universal junior secondary education&#13;
from the current 89 percent within the next few years, without donor assistance. The province&#13;
now concentrates on improving the quality of both junior and senior secondary education, which&#13;
are already producing many well-performing graduates. The public and private school systems do&#13;
this by setting and monitoring high standards, creating centers of excellence, trying new&#13;
technologies, and training staff. Because of its achievements and small size, Yogyakarta is&#13;
beginning to serve as a national model for testing the next generation of approaches in classroom&#13;
instruction. As it does so, the province will develop mechanisms to evaluate the success of its&#13;
innovations, share lessons learned with other provinces, and expand its participation in&#13;
international comparisons of educational achievement. Yogyakarta will continue to support its&#13;
private schools through training and the provision of other quality inputs.&#13;
Central Kalimantan&#13;
1.40   Socioeconomic Background. Central Kalimantan has the smallest and most scattered&#13;
population of the four provinces. Although it remains sparsely inhabited, the population is&#13;
growing and becoming more urbanized. Four out of five people live in rural areas, but the urban&#13;
population grew by an average of 10 percent a year from 1980-1990. Nine rivers provide the&#13;
main transportation links between towns and villages. About 15 percent of the population lives&#13;
in isolated villages of 100-200 people in remote mountainous and border areas, where travel is&#13;
often extremely difficult. The indigenous Dayak groups of Central Kalimantan have traditionally&#13;
practiced subsistence farming using slash-and-bum techniques. Transmigration largely from Java&#13;
has brought plantation development and other changes to some rural areas. The Government has&#13;
proposed to expand this program in the coming years, particularly in Kotawaringin Timur district.&#13;
About 60 percent of the province's villages are classified by the Government as poor villages.&#13;
1.41   Employment in Central Kalimantan is concentrated in agriculture (65 percent) while&#13;
manufacturing absorbs only 7 percent of the labor force. The province is rich in natural resources&#13;
which are being exploited in enclave fashion. For this reason, GDP per capita is the highest&#13;
among the four project provinces, though it grew more slowly (3 percent) than the national&#13;
average during 1983-1993 and was not broadly distributed. Wage premiums for more highly&#13;
educated workers are narrower than the average for Indonesia. The current structure of the&#13;
economy has not begun to marginalize those workers with low educational qualification.&#13;
1.42   Education System. Primary schools in Central Kalimantan enroll 265,000 students for a&#13;
gross enrollment rate of 108 percent, although many do not finish the full six years. At the junior&#13;
secondary level, the gross enrollment rate is 50 percent, compared to the national rate of 58&#13;
percent. The system enrolls just 59,000 junior secondary school students (compared to over a&#13;
million in Central Java), the smallest number of the four provinces. About 80 percent of those of&#13;
junior secondary school age live in rural areas. The two districts of Kotawaringin Timur and&#13;
Kapuas account for nearly three-quarters of the province's out-of-school youth of junior&#13;
secondary school age. Public schools enroll about twice as many students as private schools not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
StaffAppraisal Report                               13&#13;
only at the junior secondary level but also at the senior secondary level (unlike the Java&#13;
provinces, where private schooling predominates at the senior level). The senior secondary gross&#13;
enrollment rate (30 percent) is less than half Yogyakarta's rate.&#13;
1.43   Subsector Issues. Low population density in both Kalimantan provinces (for example,&#13;
11 persons per square kilometer in Central Kalimantan compared to over 900 in Yogyakarta)&#13;
compounds the difficulty of providing access to secondary education, although the absolute&#13;
number of out-of-school youth is relatively low. In addition, primary school retention and&#13;
graduation rates are particularly low in this province, a weakness that limits the potential for&#13;
junior secondary expansion. Many rural areas of Central Kalimantan are not easily reached, have&#13;
populations that are too small for a regular SMP, and are in poor districts. As a result, the&#13;
province's urban gross enrollment rate at the junior secondary level is nearly double the rural&#13;
gross enrollment rate. This disparity is significantly more pronounced in both Kalimantan&#13;
provinces than in the nation as a whole. Because the population is small and scattered, the&#13;
average size of junior secondary schools here (I70) is less than half the average enrollment in&#13;
high-density Central Java (357). Private schools have an average of only about 100 students each.&#13;
Distance and the lack of accommodations prevent students in remote areas from attending school.&#13;
1.44   Costs also represent an access barrier, though many parents are willing to make&#13;
significant sacrifices to send children to school. Despite the fact that household expenses at&#13;
private schools are higher than in public schools, the number of private schools has increased&#13;
over the past decade, though they enroll a smaller proportion of students here than in the other&#13;
provinces. It is difficult to make private schools viable in many parts of Central Kalimantan&#13;
because of the undeveloped formal economy and difficult terrain, and unlike West Kalimantan,&#13;
there are fewer religious and other organizations involved. As a result, about 63 percent of&#13;
private schools are relatively underdeveloped (in the lowest two categories of the private school&#13;
classification). In addition to direct costs, opportunity costs are also high for students' families&#13;
who rely on teenagers for agriculture, fishing, and household chores during normal school hours.&#13;
Pockets of economic activity (such as gold mining) offer young people with less than a secondary&#13;
school education some opportunities for wage employment.&#13;
1.45   The quality of schooling also suffers in the isolated, poor communities of the two&#13;
Kalimantan provinces. In 1994/95, the average national exam scores in all the province's schools&#13;
were moderate to poor; none was classified as good. Twenty percent of teachers in Central&#13;
Kalimantan have only a secondary school education themselves. Isolation often cuts teachers off&#13;
from  further training or peer support.  These teachers need ongoing training, upgrading,&#13;
monitoring, and mentoring to strengthen their subject matter knowledge, pedagogical skills, and&#13;
confidence in the classroom. But many of the province's teachers have not been covered by the&#13;
PKG training program because of their isolation. In addition, the highest concentration of the&#13;
teaching force is in urban areas where living conditions are better and adequate housing is&#13;
available, while rural areas have an acute undersupply of qualified subject teachers. Due to the&#13;
shortage of teachers, small rural junior secondary schools generally have multisubject teachers&#13;
who are often not trained adequately in all subjects they teach, if in any.&#13;
1.46   In rural areas low quality of teaching is compounded by the widespread employment of&#13;
part-time teachers, often poorly qualified and motivated. Increasing the challenge of teaching is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14               Central Indonesia Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
the shortage of appropriate teaching materials and facilities. Science is most often taught by&#13;
lecture in regular classrooms with no teaching aids or equipment. Parents use only 3 percent of&#13;
junior secondary schooling expenditure for textbooks.&#13;
1.47   Broad Subsector Strategy. Central Kalimantan will continue to expand junior secondary&#13;
education, but the scale of the expansion will be relatively modest given the limited wage&#13;
differentials between primary and secondary graduates and the small number and proportion of&#13;
students completing the primary system. Because community-supported private schools are&#13;
particularly weak in this province, the planned role of the public sector is crucial. First, Central&#13;
Kalimantan will direct its investment at geographically isolated populations with low enrollment&#13;
rates, where the province's limited private school system is not functioning. In these areas, the&#13;
province will employ a range of options to reach potential students, such as building small&#13;
schools to serve small communities, attracting teachers to underserved areas, supporting village-&#13;
based schooling, and providing accommodation for students. Second, quality will be improved to&#13;
increase the value of a junior secondary education, a development that would encourage students&#13;
to complete the primary cycle and would help prepare students for further training as the&#13;
province's natural resources are increasingly exploited. While maintaining quality in its own&#13;
schools, the province will also support the relatively weak private sector so it can remain viable,&#13;
particularly in remote areas. Third, the province will design its interventions to ease the financial&#13;
burden of the poor.&#13;
West Kalimantan&#13;
1.48   Socioeconomic Background. About a third of West Kalimantan's population was&#13;
considered to be living in poverty in 1990, a high rate for Indonesia. However, the province is&#13;
undergoing rapid economic and demographic change: GDP per capita grew by 6 percent&#13;
annually 1983-1993, one of the highest rates in the country. The primary port city of Pontianak is&#13;
a growing center for industry and regional trade. Traditionally, the province has relied on river&#13;
transport, like Central Kalimantan. However, roads are becoming more important for the 79&#13;
percent of the population living in rural areas and have expanded the province's trade with&#13;
bordering Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo). As a result of this growth, isolated families and entire&#13;
villages are shifting from river areas to road areas to gain access to goods, services, and jobs. In&#13;
addition, because of the province's low population density, GOI is resettling volunteer&#13;
transmigrants from other parts of Indonesia in rural plantation areas (especially rubber and palm&#13;
oil), where the soil is not fertile enough for growing rice.&#13;
1.49   West Kalimantan's economy remains heavily dependent on agriculture, and 68 percent of&#13;
employed people were in that sector in 1993. But the nature of the agricultural activities (for&#13;
example, the plantation crops) has put per capita incomes close to the average for Indonesia. In&#13;
their turn, satisfactory average per capita income and higher economic growth rates have resulted&#13;
in higher than average salaries for employed persons of all levels of education attainment, but&#13;
especially at primary and junior secondary levels. A corollary of this is that wage premiums for&#13;
educated workers are smaller than in other provinces (16 percent for junior secondary graduates&#13;
and 5 percent for senior secondary graduates). However, many people in rural areas are largely&#13;
outside the formal economy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
StaffAppraisal Report                               15&#13;
1.50   Education System. At the primary level, West Kalimantan has about 620,000 pupils in&#13;
3,870 schools, 90 percent of which are public. The primary gross enrollment rate is 111 percent.&#13;
The secondary school enrollment rates are the lowest of the four project provinces. At the junior&#13;
secondary level, the gross enrollment rate is 46 percent, compared to the national rate of 58&#13;
percent. The junior secondary system enrolls 122,000 students, about 51,000 of them in private&#13;
schools. The proportion of schools that are public or private Madrasahs has doubled over the past&#13;
decade. Schools in plantation areas adjacent to indigenous Dayak communities sometimes serve a&#13;
mixture of ethnic and religious groups. In fact, unlike the other project provinces, where most&#13;
SMP students are Islamic, SMP students in West Kalimantan are as likely to be either Christian&#13;
or Buddhist as Muslim. At the senior secondary level, the gross enrollment ratio is 24 percent&#13;
(compared to the national rate of 34 percent). Although public schools account for just over a&#13;
quarter of the total number of senior secondary schools in the province, they enroll as many&#13;
students as private schools.&#13;
1.51   Subsector Issues. As in other parts of Kalimantan, access to education is restricted by&#13;
distance and cost. As a result, the rural enrollment rate in West Kalimantan is less than a third of&#13;
the enrollment rate in urban areas; in contrast, nationally the rural rate is more than half the urban&#13;
rate. Although the most populated districts near the coastal road and river networks account for&#13;
the majority of the province's youth who are not in junior secondary school, the more remote and&#13;
sparsely populated districts (such as Sintang, Sanggau, and Ketapang) have lower enrollment&#13;
rates. Much of the population lives in small villages scattered over difficult terrain that have an&#13;
insufficient number of young people to justify a separate school of typical size. Transportation to&#13;
the nearest school is often a great distance by foot or by river, and flooding during the rainy&#13;
season isolates villages from each other. Schools in such areas also find it difficult to attract good&#13;
teachers because of harsh local conditions.&#13;
1.52   If they have a school at all, remote villages are often served by a small private school.&#13;
The average size of junior secondary schools in the province as a whole (191) is smaller here than&#13;
in the Java provinces. A large number of rural private schools have been established by&#13;
communities, with limited resources, as a last resort. However, many of them are weak: 80&#13;
percent of all private schools have not advanced in their accreditation beyond the basic&#13;
"registered" status. In some villages, Madrasahs open where the public sector has not reached.&#13;
They are more acceptable than public schools to many Muslim parents of females, partly because&#13;
of their religious instruction and partly because of their proximity to the village. However, the&#13;
costs of private Madrasahs and other schools is more than many can afford. In addition to high&#13;
direct costs relative to rural incomes, opportunity costs in certain areas limit enrollment. Young&#13;
people in certain subdistricts can find forestry jobs or work in home industries, and many are&#13;
needed to help their parents at home or in economic activities such as fishing or farming during&#13;
morning school hours.&#13;
1.53   The qusality of the small, private schools that are common in remote areas is often low.&#13;
National examination (NEM) scores for the province declined between 1992/93 and 1994/95 and&#13;
were especially weak in science, mathematics, and English. Private school teachers are generally&#13;
less qualified than their public school counterparts: more than half have no more than a senior&#13;
secondary school education. Of all teachers, in both public and private schools, only 11 percent&#13;
have the newly required qualification of DIII degree, and about 30 percent even have no training&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16               Central Indonesia Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
beyond secondary school. Because of their isolation, many receive limited or no inservice&#13;
training or onservice support. The relatively high costs met by families affect not only access but&#13;
quality. After paying the necessary registration fees and other costs needed to establish a school&#13;
or enroll their children, parents and school associations often cannot afford significant amounts to&#13;
ensure students get a quality education. For example, families spend more than three times as&#13;
much for school uniforms as for textbooks.&#13;
1.54   Broad Subsector Strategy.  Junior secondary education in this province will be&#13;
developed at a moderate pace to help the province manage and take advantage of demographic&#13;
and economic change. The province will give special attention to expanding education for the&#13;
majority of the rural population who are unlikely to benefit substantially from rapid change&#13;
unless they are better educated. This agenda will be supported in several ways. First, while&#13;
addressing barriers of geography and distance by placing small schools in remote areas, the&#13;
province will also take advantage of village consolidation and improved transportation networks&#13;
by placing somewhat larger schools in more densely populated areas. Public schools will be&#13;
placed in such rural settlements where private schools have not developed, either because of&#13;
isolation or low regional incomes. Stronger private schools, including religious schools, will be&#13;
allowed to grow without competition from the public sector. Second, quality will be addressed&#13;
urgently, particularly in rural schools that have difficulty training unqualified teachers and&#13;
keeping good ones. Relatively weak community-supported schools, in particular, will be given&#13;
special consideration. Third, the province's expansion efforts will be designed to keep the cost of&#13;
education reasonable for the high number of people living in poverty.&#13;

2. GOVERNMENT AND BANK STRATEGY&#13;
AND LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
A.  GOVERNMENT STRATEGY&#13;
2.1    As part of the Repelita VI (1994/99) program, the Government set the important goal of&#13;
extending access to high quality junior secondary education. This objective is integral to the goal&#13;
of attaining universal coverage of nine years of basic education by the end of Repelita VIII&#13;
(2008/09). To support this ambitious goal, the Government has adopted several policy measures&#13;
and strategies (see Annex 9): (a) it plans to provide additional resources to basic education,&#13;
starting with an increase of 20 percent in the overall budget of education for the 1996/97 fiscal&#13;
year; (b) it has abolished junior secondary school fees and admission requirements for primary&#13;
school graduates; (c) it is providing free textbooks for all primary and junior secondary&#13;
schoolchildren; (d) it is supporting private junior secondary schools with public teachers and&#13;
other inputs to maintain and even increase their significant enrollment participation at this school&#13;
level; (e) it continues to upgrade teachers' skills for both public and private schools through&#13;
inservice programs; (f) it has started the construction or development of regular or alternative&#13;
schools in rural and remote villages; (g) it has phased out all diploma courses for the preservice&#13;
education of secondary school teachers (junior and senior) so all new teachers at that level now&#13;
need to have an SI (undergraduate degree); (h) it is upgrading existing junior secondary school&#13;
teachers to DII (two-year post-secondary diploma) at public expense; and (i) it is extending&#13;
subsidies (scholarships) to capable but poor students to begin or continue junior secondary&#13;
education.&#13;
B.    LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
2.2   Integration of the following lessons from previous Bank projects would help build on the&#13;
exceptional performance of the Bank in the education sector in Indonesia. All the 21 previous&#13;
projects have been judged satisfactory by OED, and they have set the stage for the more&#13;
challenging tasks in this sector. OED Document No. 9752, Indonesian Education and the World&#13;
Bank: an Assessment of Two Decades of Lending (1991) found that support for education&#13;
projects was timely and that the Bank gave valuable advice to the Government. Although the&#13;
projects were successful, there is a continuing need to improve the quality of education and to&#13;
strengthen management at the provincial level, particularly in light of the current trend of&#13;
deconcentrating responsibilities, a process this project will support.&#13;
2.3    OED Report. The 1991 report has several conclusions and recommendations that are&#13;
relevant for this project:&#13;
Issue: Institution building is basic to the long-term goal of increasing the self-sufficiency&#13;
of the Indonesian education system (p. 58).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18               Central Indonesia Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
Project Response: Increased emphasis on institution building and self-management at&#13;
provincial and district levels.&#13;
Issue: Projects must be placed and discussed within the framework of the policy dialogue&#13;
(p. 65).&#13;
Project Response: Regular discussions between MOEC and the Bank on development&#13;
priorities and the role of the Bank related to other donors are instrumental in determining&#13;
agenda for Bank lending.&#13;
Issue: Despite explicit goals, projects have not always achieved equitable distribution of&#13;
project benefits to the poor (p. 68).&#13;
Project Response: Several project interventions are specifically targeted to the poor:&#13;
school construction in rural areas, SMP Terbuka, and the scholarship program.&#13;
Issue: Previous projects (mainly national in scope) were often overly complex or&#13;
underestimated absorption constraints and experience, resulting in unsatisfactory&#13;
implementation (p. 70).&#13;
Project Response: The project has been designed with extensive participation from&#13;
communities, existing schools, district and provincial MOEC staff.&#13;
Issue: GOI should spend a greater amount of its budget on education, to achieve the&#13;
necessary quality and institutional objectives (p. 78).&#13;
Project Response: Indonesia's education expenditures are 14 percent of the total&#13;
Government budget; the 1996/97 budget shows an increase of 20 percent over last year,&#13;
of which 72 percent is spent on basic education (primary and junior secondary).&#13;
Issue: Despite its role in providing educational opportunities, the private system has&#13;
received limited support from GOI and the Bank (p. 79).&#13;
Project Response: GOI is committed to ensuring that the contribution from the private&#13;
sector in junior secondary education is maintained and strengthened; recent projects have&#13;
provided private schools with quality inputs.&#13;
2.4    Lessons from  Completed and Ongoing Projects in Secondary Education. Other&#13;
lessons have been drawn or confirmed by the General Operational Review of Secondary&#13;
Education Projects by HDD. Implementation of the Indonesia Secondary Education Project&#13;
(Loan 2472-IND) and the ongoing Second Secondary Education and Management Project (Loan&#13;
3158-fND) are particularly relevant in this respect.&#13;
(a)    Overall Project Design.  The expansion of secondary education should be&#13;
addressed through a dual strategy of increasing school places and improving the&#13;
quality of education. The proposed project would include both expansion and&#13;
quality improvement objectives, to ensure continual demand for education and to&#13;
improve repetition and drop-out rates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                            19&#13;
(b)   Flexibility in the Design of Components.  Attempts to impose standard&#13;
solutions to the variety of conditions in Indonesia (as in all large countries) have&#13;
not been successful, and GOI is working to correct this situation. Among others,&#13;
the policy of limiting the size of government schools to a minimum of nine&#13;
classrooms has been reviewed, to allow Government schools to be established in&#13;
communities with small populations and experimentation has started with&#13;
alternative models of junior secondary education.&#13;
(c)    Ownership and Participation. Local communities contribute significantly to&#13;
the development of education in their areas. Stakeholders and clients are also&#13;
well placed to evaluate project outcomes. They know when children are learning&#13;
and how investments in schools are being used. Stakeholder involvement (which&#13;
was emphasized during the preparation process, see Annex 13) is critical to fully&#13;
measure project outcomes, to understand how a project is unfolding and to help&#13;
develop appropriate corrective measures when necessary.  The project will&#13;
promote and supplement the use of local resources for education by providing&#13;
assistance in kind and incentives for both private and public education.&#13;
C.  BANK STRATEGY AND RATIONALE FOR INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.5    This project -- one of the first in a series of junior secondary education projects --&#13;
supports the Bank's 1995 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Indonesia, which was&#13;
presented to the Board on March 21, 1995. The CAS endorses Government's role towards&#13;
establishing a regulatory framework and in supporting decentralization and participation. In&#13;
addition, the CAS highlights the importance of continued emphasis on human resource&#13;
development to promote economic growth, competitiveness, and structural transformation, and&#13;
on a more selective, efficient use of public resources. The design of the proposed project is also&#13;
consistent with the Bank's strategy of balanced assistance to the education sector, which includes&#13;
on-going and proposed assistance for (a) improving the quality of primary education, including&#13;
possible interventions in early childhood development, (b) expansion and quality improvement of&#13;
lower-secondary education, (c) quality improvement of upper-secondary education, (d) selective&#13;
interventions in higher education, and (e) an active policy dialogue designed to redefine and&#13;
refocus the Government's role in the education sector.&#13;
2.6   The Bank's comparative advantage in supporting junior secondary education is based on&#13;
its long-standing and close working relationship with MOEC. The Bank has engaged in a&#13;
comprehensive dialogue with MOEC that reaches far beyond this project itself, since it has&#13;
helped: (a) establish a solid conceptual and economic framework for expanding and improving&#13;
the quality of the basic education in Indonesia over the next 20 years; (b) identify the comparative&#13;
advantages for Bank's and other donors' role in the planned expansion and quality improvement&#13;
process; and (c) strengthen the decentralizing trends toward sub-central levels, province-specific&#13;
projects, and local ownership. As a result of this dialogue, the previous highly centralized,&#13;
uniform approach to project design and implementation has been replaced by an approach that&#13;
will rest on provincially based projects. The Government has now recognized the need to take&#13;
into account specific provincial situations, including economic growth trends and prospects, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20               Central Indonesia Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
existing education needs, labor market conditions, private sector delivery capacity, levels of&#13;
poverty, and geographic conditions. The Bank has also been an active partner in the discussions&#13;
on the priorities governing basic education delivery, on the role of the private sector in secondary&#13;
education and on the share of Government spending that should be allocated to basic education.&#13;
2.7   The Bank is a trusted partner in basic education in Indonesia and has substantial&#13;
experience working with the Indonesian Government in this sector. Based on the Bank's&#13;
worldwide experience, GOI sought the Bank's advice on such issues as lower-cost alternatives&#13;
for junior secondary education, how to improve quality and how to tailor the proposed increased&#13;
access programs to local needs. The proposed project represents one in an overall program of&#13;
Bank support for expansion and quality improvements in basic education. Currently, the Bank is&#13;
actively preparing two other secondary education projects and the Government has requested that&#13;
the Bank provide both financial and technical assistance for future projects. The junior secondary&#13;
education development program is supported by other donors, including ADB and OECF. This&#13;
project complements the assistance to basic education provided by several ongoing projects:&#13;
(a)    Second Secondary Education and Management Project. This project (Loan&#13;
3158-IND), approved in 1990, consisted of: provision of quality inputs in&#13;
secondary schools (teacher training, equipment and books); a review and redesign&#13;
of the student assessment system; and a redesign of the information management&#13;
system. After initial problems, mainly due to the large national scope, the project&#13;
was restructured to operate in five pilot provinces, with satisfactory results. The&#13;
implementation experience from this project has provided the basis for the design&#13;
of the current project. In addition, the Bank is now very familiar with the issues&#13;
and the agencies involved in this subsector at the provincial level.&#13;
(b)   The Primary and Secondary School Teacher Development Projects. These&#13;
two projects (Loans 3496-IND and 3979-IND) address pre-service training of&#13;
primary and secondary school teachers respectively. They complement the&#13;
current project in the preparation and quality improvements of teachers and&#13;
substantial coordination between pre-service and in-service training is achieved&#13;
through the concurrent implementation of these projects. The Bank is also&#13;
heavily involved in ensuring that maximum coordination is achieved between&#13;
teacher development projects and the in-service training components of the&#13;
secondary education development projects.&#13;
(c)    The Primary Education Quality Improvement Project. Approved in 1992,&#13;
this project (Loan 3448-IND) provides quality inputs in primary schools in six&#13;
provinces. The issues related to primary schools that impact on transition,&#13;
enrollments and quality in junior secondary schools are being addressed in this&#13;
project on a limited scale. Project impact is now being reviewed, to determnine the&#13;
further strategies for implementation on a larger scale.&#13;
(d)   The Book and Reading Development Project. The project (Loan 3887-IND)&#13;
has recently started implementation (September 1995) to provide free textbooks&#13;
on a one-to-one basis to all primary and junior secondary education students in all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                            21&#13;
subjects. Books will be provided both to public and private schools. The project&#13;
provides one of the most essential quality inputs into basic education on a&#13;
systematic basis, and complements the secondary education development&#13;
projects, which will focus on supporting non-textbook educational materials and&#13;
teaching aids. Annex 9 provides details on Government and Bank strategies for&#13;
development of the sector.&#13;

3.  THE PROJECT&#13;
A.    PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.1    The project would assist the MOEC in addressing the quality and coverage of junior&#13;
secondary education in the provinces of Central Java, Yogyakarta, Central Kalimantan, and&#13;
West Kalimantan. The project's objectives are to:&#13;
(a)   expand access to junior secondary education in a cost-effective and equitable&#13;
way;&#13;
(b)   improve the quality of junior and senior secondary education; and&#13;
(c)   strengthen the management of the education system at all levels.&#13;
B.    PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS&#13;
3.2   Project impact will be assessed using the following indicators (See Annex 15):&#13;
(a)   achievement of project enrollment targets (satisfactory = 75 percent) in new&#13;
junior secondary schools and alternative programs by project completion date,&#13;
by province and district;&#13;
(b)    utilization of at least 75 percent of new capacity created by the project, by&#13;
province, district, subdistrict, and grade;&#13;
(c)   an increase in student examination scores, by province, district, subject, and&#13;
public and private school by an average of 0.2 points during the project; and&#13;
(d)   implementation of at least 80 percent of the work program as measured by the&#13;
physical targets and budget spent annually for project and routine activities in&#13;
each province.&#13;
C.    PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Project Components&#13;
3.3   To meet the objectives of increasing access to junior secondary education, improving&#13;
the quality of secondary education, and enhancing education management, activities related to&#13;
the following components and subcomponents would be implemented selectively and in&#13;
varying degrees in the public and private systems of the four project provinces. The total cost&#13;
of the project is $154.1 million, including contingencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
StaffAppraisal Report                            23&#13;
3.4    Expand Access (estimated base costs of $60.3 million). To improve access to junior&#13;
secondary education, the project would (a) create a total of 45,000 school places by building&#13;
regular and small junior secondary schools in underserved rural areas; (b) gradually expand&#13;
alternative equivalency programs by creating 11,000 places with greater quality inputs for&#13;
those who cannot attend regular schools, and monitor the programs' effectiveness; (c) assist&#13;
in community construction of student and teacher accommodations for public and private&#13;
schools in isolated areas; (d) provide contract teachers for rural areas; (e) finance scholarships&#13;
for 34,000 poor students who perform well, with priority given to girls in public and private&#13;
schools; and (f) provide parents with information about how to take full advantage of the&#13;
benefits of junior secondary schooling in their local areas. See Annex 10 for more details on&#13;
options for increasing access. During negotiations the Government gave assurances that it&#13;
would (i) employ contract teachers, (ii) award scholarships, and (iii) select locations for the&#13;
construction of schools and dormitories, in accordance with criteria acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
3.5   Improve Quality (estimated base costs of $58.2 million). To improve the quality of&#13;
junior secondary education, the project would (a) strengthen school teachers' subject-matter&#13;
knowledge and pedagogical skills, including identification of learning difficulties, through&#13;
inservice and upgrading training programs, and support measures to bring teachers to rural&#13;
areas; (b) enhance the learning environment by providing schools with tools for teaching and&#13;
learning, including educational equipment and materials; science teaching aids; new teaching&#13;
rooms; and reference and library books; (c) support the development of school-level&#13;
initiatives to improve quality; and (d) further develop tests, examinations, and assessment&#13;
systems by training teachers in student evaluation, providing technical assistance, and&#13;
developing item databanks for school examinations. Project interventions would be aimed&#13;
particularly at public and private schools (including Madrasahs) in poor communities to&#13;
encourage continued private sector participation in the provision of education and to reduce&#13;
inequity in the project provinces. These access and quality interventions would help increase&#13;
access of girls in areas where gender disparities still exist.&#13;
3.6    Strengthen Education Management (estimated base costs of $5.9 million). To&#13;
strengthen the management of the education system, the project would (a) train school&#13;
principals and other administrators in managing schools and providing pedagogical support to&#13;
teachers; and (b) develop managerial and data analysis capacity to allow provincial and&#13;
district staff to effectively handle their increasing responsibilities for education planning and&#13;
management.&#13;
3.7    Support Project Management (estimated base costs of $7.0 million). The project&#13;
would support the strengthening of institutional capacities as well as the operational costs of&#13;
project management by the Kanwils, Kandeps/Kanin, and the MOEC directorate of secondary&#13;
education (Dikmenum).&#13;
Detailed Description of Interventions for each Province&#13;
3.8    Central Java (estimated base costs of $57.6 million). The project would complement&#13;
the efforts of the Government and donors in increasing enrollment in and improving the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24                Central Indonesia Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
quality of junior secondary school, and particularly in meeting the needs of rural communities&#13;
where no school exists. Under the project, the province would create an additional 38,000&#13;
junior secondary school places in areas where enrollment rates are low.&#13;
3.9    Access. The project would build, furnish, and equip 77 new public SMPs of up to&#13;
nine classrooms to cater for an additional 28,000 students in large rural communities without&#13;
a public or private school. To target the poor, half of the new schools would be located in&#13;
villages classified as poor by the Government. In small rural communities, schools three- or&#13;
six-classroom schools may be more appropriate than nine-classroom schools. As part of total&#13;
project costs, the Government would acquire land required for the schools. The project would&#13;
provide contract teachers in rural schools as part of a pilot scheme to reduce teacher shortages&#13;
in the rural areas.&#13;
3.10   To reach potential students who cannot attend school because of direct and&#13;
opportunity costs, the project would fund an expansion of SMP Terbuka for an additional&#13;
6,000 students. The expansion would increase female access to schools. Emphasis would be&#13;
given to the provision of teaching and reference materials for students and teachers. Funding&#13;
for operational costs would allow teachers to attend class sessions and remove some of the&#13;
key obstacles to effective operations of this program. As in other project provinces,&#13;
intervention in the SMP Terbuka program would be modest and aimed at increasing its&#13;
quality while the program's effectiveness in teaching and retaining students is monitored and&#13;
evaluated.&#13;
3.11   To assist rural families who cannot afford to pay for education the project would&#13;
provide annual scholarships through GOI's scholarship program to approximately 24,600&#13;
low-income Central Java students who perform well in school. This program has a well&#13;
established selection procedure which involves various levels from the school to the Kanwil.&#13;
The disbursement of the funds will be directly to the recipient through the Provincial Pos Giro&#13;
Office. The project would also devote some funds for the development and production of&#13;
materials to sensitize parents to the benefits of junior secondary education and options for&#13;
schooling their children, particularly in areas where communities feel these are beyond their&#13;
reach.&#13;
3.12   Quality. To improve quality in public and private schools, Central Java would&#13;
concentrate on strengthening teacher skills and providing them with teaching resources. A&#13;
total of about 16,000 teachers would be given PKG inservice training. The aim would be to&#13;
develop a systematic link between the district and provincial trainers and school supervisors&#13;
to ensure that good teaching practices are routinized in the system. To reduce costs of&#13;
operation and logistical problems, training for most teachers would be moved from the&#13;
provincial headquarters to the district headquarters. For teachers in very remote areas, training&#13;
would be held in the provincial headquarters three times a year, followed by school visits by&#13;
teams who would cover multiple subjects. Funding would continue for the wide-reaching&#13;
MGMP network of subject-matter teacher associations to provide teachers skills in use of&#13;
tests and identification of learning weaknesses. SMP Terbuka teachers and tutors would also&#13;
receive training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                          25&#13;
3.13   The project would also provide a variety of teaching materials and equipment for&#13;
science and other subjects, about 3 million reference and library books for public and private&#13;
schools, and school office equipment. Science equipment would be provided in a variety of&#13;
packages to suit the diverse types and conditions of schools in the province. In addition,&#13;
libraries and administration/teacher rooms would be built at selected existing schools.&#13;
Support for expansion of quality public and private schools, especially religious schools in&#13;
rural communities would make it easier for girls to get access to junior secondary education&#13;
in a culturally acceptable way.&#13;
3.14   Education Management. Because of the sheer size of its education system in relation&#13;
to the other project provinces and its goal of rapidly expanding the system, Central Java&#13;
would need improved mechanisms and technology to manage its schools and analyze trends&#13;
for planning. To build local management capacity, the project would assist Kandep/Kanin and&#13;
Kanwil staff in developing information systems to analyze trends and identify problems. The&#13;
project would finance local and overseas technical assistance; incountry training; computers&#13;
and other equipment; the development, printing, and purchase of materials; office supplies;&#13;
and computer software. To support project management in Central Java, the project would&#13;
finance administrative operational costs and salaries, incountry training, and local and&#13;
overseas technical assistance.&#13;
3.15   Yogyakarta (estimated base costs of $25.2 million). As a result of its broad coverage&#13;
at the junior secondary level and its declining cohort population, Yogyakarta would focus on&#13;
improving quality rather than expanding access.  Innovative approaches in improving&#13;
schooling and teaching technologies would be implemented and evaluated, and the province&#13;
would participate in international comparisons of educational achievement.&#13;
3.16   Access.  No new schools or classrooms would be built under the project in&#13;
Yogyakarta, although specialized teaching rooms would be added to existing schools to&#13;
strengthen their teaching capacity (see Quality). The project would address remaining poverty&#13;
constraints to access by providing scholarships to 3,200 low-income students with high&#13;
academic achievement under the national scholarship program. The project would also&#13;
provide the public with information about the benefits of junior secondary education and&#13;
options for schooling their children, particularly in remaining pockets of lower enrollment.&#13;
3.17   Quality. Now that most young people are in school, Yogyakarta wants to improve&#13;
education quality to prepare them to respond to changes in the economy and society.&#13;
Yogyakarta's experience and lessons learned would serve to guide other parts of the country&#13;
in the future. To improve the quality of junior and senior secondary education, Yogyakarta&#13;
would implement several types of activities. First, the province would provide existing&#13;
schools with better teaching facilities, including specialized teaching rooms - including&#13;
computer rooms, language laboratories, science laboratories, libraries, and audiovisual aid&#13;
rooms - at selected schools. The second main area is staff development. About a third of the&#13;
province's public and private school teachers would receive either PKG training or continued&#13;
support through MGMP subject teacher associations. A majority of science and other subject&#13;
teachers and librarians would receive specialized training, including training in the use of&#13;
education technology. Third, the supply of instructional tools in public and private school&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26               Central Indonesia Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
classrooms -including reference and library books, science materials, audiovisual aids, and&#13;
computers -would be increased. In addition, new types of education equipment would be&#13;
gradually introduced and evaluated in selected schools through training and technical&#13;
assistance, and key staff would investigate emerging technologies used in other countries&#13;
through overseas training. Fourth, ongoing efforts in international as well as classroom&#13;
assessments of student performance, and academic projects of individual public and private&#13;
students and school teams, would be supported.&#13;
3.18   Education Management. Because of the new directions Yogyakarta is taking to&#13;
improve quality, the provincial education staff's ability to evaluate the effectiveness of&#13;
introduced measures is especially important. The project would also assist Yogyakarta in its&#13;
new management and planning functions. To improve management of schools, school&#13;
administrators would receive management training. The project would finance local and&#13;
overseas technical assistance; incountry training; computers and other equipment; the&#13;
development, printing, and purchase of materials; office supplies; and computer software. To&#13;
support project management, the project would finance administration operational costs and&#13;
salaries, incountry training, and local and foreign technical assistance.&#13;
3.19   Central Kalimantan (estimated base costs of $20.3 million). The scale of the Central&#13;
Kalimanitan's expansion of school places would be small, but would be aimed at difficult&#13;
areas with poor populations where adequate private schooling is not viable. The project&#13;
would also aim to improve the quality of rural schools and provide open schooling for a&#13;
limited number of students who cannot attend regular schools.&#13;
3.20   Access. Under the project, Central Kalimantan would create about 8,400 school&#13;
places. To increase access in rural areas with small, scattered populations, the project would&#13;
build, furnish, and equip 53 SMP Kecils ("small SMPs") with three classrooms, accounting&#13;
for about three-quarters of new places provided under the project. The Government would&#13;
acquire land for these schools as part of total project costs. Districts with low enrollment rates&#13;
and villages classified as poor would receive priority. The main advantage of the SMP Kecil&#13;
is that it would allow the services of traditional schools to be provided to underserved areas of&#13;
poverty that have relatively small numbers of potential students, particularly girls, in the&#13;
catchment area. To help attract and retain good teachers and principals in such areas, grants&#13;
for community construction of a total of 160 residences also would be supported under the&#13;
project for public and private schools. For some remote areas that have high drop-out rates&#13;
and irregular attendance because of difficulties in commuting to school, the project would&#13;
provide grants for community construction of 40 dormitories. This effort would be provided&#13;
selectively to communities where there is good justification and where contribution from the&#13;
community is evident. For schools that have insufficient teachers and have trouble attracting&#13;
staff, contract teachers would be hired. The project would also modestly expand the SMP&#13;
Terbuka program through the provision of learning and reference books to about 2,000&#13;
students and teachers, and by financing operating costs. Scholarships would be provided to&#13;
2,000 low-income students per year. The project would also provide for the development of&#13;
public information about the benefits of junior secondary education and local options for&#13;
schooling.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                           27&#13;
3.21   Quality. To improve teacher skills and knowledge, the project would provide&#13;
inservice PKG training to about 1,225 teachers, as well as MGMP and other training to 1,450&#13;
of the province's 4,300 teachers, including training in content of core subjects, identification&#13;
of learning weaknesses, and classroom assessment methods. In addition, teacher instructors&#13;
would receive training in subject areas to strengthen the PKG program in the province. For&#13;
remote areas, the PKG program would be modified to local circumstances - for example, by&#13;
financing three two-week courses annually and teams to spend two or more days helping not&#13;
just teachers in PKG training but all teachers at a remote school. The program would also&#13;
integrate principals into the training program so they can provide systematic onservice&#13;
support to teachers in their schools. To improve the quality of science instruction, the project&#13;
would provide science equipment to both public and private schools in rural areas. All&#13;
schools in these areas would be classified to determine their potential for using different types&#13;
of equipment, and a variety of packages would be developed to suit their needs. The majority&#13;
of schools in the project, which are generally rural and poor, would receive fairly simple&#13;
equipment. These schools would also receive other teaching aids and equipment. The project&#13;
would provide about 600,000 reference and library books and would build libraries at 18&#13;
existing schools without them. Examinations item banks, storing of examinations, and&#13;
techniques for analyzing learning weaknesses would be developed through local technical&#13;
assistance to improve student achievement and to feed the results of student assessment back&#13;
to the classroom level. Annex I I provides details of these programs.&#13;
3.22   In this province, the addition of student and teacher accommodation would help&#13;
promote access of girls in areas where this is still a problem. It would be easier to attract and&#13;
retain female teachers and students in these areas especially when combined with&#13;
scholarships, contract teacher positions and quality improvement of private/community&#13;
schools.&#13;
3.23   Education Management. To strengthen the province's ability to take on additional&#13;
planning and management responsibility, the project would assist Kanwil and Kandep/Kanin&#13;
staff in developing and making better use of its information systems. The project would also&#13;
strengthen the flow of usable information among schools and education authorities in schools,&#13;
districts, provinces, and Jakarta, in part by expanding the use of technologies that reduce the&#13;
distance barrier in isolated areas. School principals would be provided with school&#13;
management training. To improve educational management, the project would finance local&#13;
and overseas technical assistance; incountry training; computers and other equipment; the&#13;
development, printing, and purchase of materials; office supplies; and computer software. To&#13;
support project management in Central Kalimantan, the project would finance administrative&#13;
operational costs and salaries, incountry training and local and overseas technical assistance.&#13;
3.24   West Kalimantan (estimated base costs of $23.5 million). Like Central Kalimantan,&#13;
West Kalimantan would have to implement a wide variety of strategies to improve access and&#13;
quality in areas of low population density. The project would expand enrollment in remote&#13;
and low income areas by 14,000 places through the construction of smaller schools and the&#13;
modest expansion of nonconventional education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28               Central Indonesia Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
3.25  Access. West Kalimantan faces many of the same problems of access as Central&#13;
Kalimantan, though the population density is higher and the private school system is more&#13;
extensive. The province can begin to take advantage of improving transportation networks.&#13;
For remote areas of poverty that the private sector does not and is unlikely to cover, the&#13;
project would fund the construction and furnishing of 50 three-classroom SMP Kecils, which&#13;
would serve 6,000 male and female students. For more populated rural areas and sites that&#13;
are better served by road or water, the province would build, furnish, and equip 20 six-&#13;
classroom SMPs, which would serve 4,800 students. The cost to Government of acquiring&#13;
land for schools would be included in total project costs. The project would conduct&#13;
feasibility studies for SMP Terbuka and create about 3,000 Terbuka male and female student&#13;
places where distance or cost is a constraint, though the provision of educational materials&#13;
and operations funds. For students who are willing to live away from home to attend the&#13;
nearest school, grants for community construction of 20 student dormitories would be&#13;
supported where there is a demonstrated interest. For schools that do not have enough&#13;
qualified teachers, the project would finance the hiring of contract teachers for limited periods&#13;
and support grants for community construction of 34 teacher accommodations to attract&#13;
permanent teachers. Scholarships under the national program would be extended annually to&#13;
4,200 low-income students with high achievement. The project would also provide for the&#13;
development of information to inform the public about the benefits of junior secondary&#13;
education and local schooling opportunities.&#13;
3.26   Quality. To improve teacher quality, West Kalimantan is giving particular attention&#13;
to its rural public and private school teachers, many of whom are undertrained and need&#13;
ongoing support. About 360 teachers would receive PKG training and another 1,800 would&#13;
receive local MGMP training in subject areas. Because many of its rural teachers start from a&#13;
weak base, West Kalimantan would upgrade teachers without the DIII qualification (those&#13;
with DI and DII) through Open University courses. The project would support efforts to&#13;
retain teachers in rural areas not only by providing more training and better housing (see&#13;
above), but also by financing and studying the benefits of an existing teacher rotation scheme&#13;
designed to bring about more balanced and equitable distribution of teachers. To improve the&#13;
quality and effectiveness of the expanding SMP Terbuka program, its tutors and&#13;
administrators would be upgraded. As in Central Kalimantan, the project would also provide&#13;
reference and library books, simple laboratory equipment, and teaching materials to improve&#13;
quality at both public and private schools. New libraries would be built at 15 selected existing&#13;
schools.  Local technical assistance would support the development of examinations&#13;
databases, educational studies, and evaluations, and to encourage greater use of student&#13;
assessment at the school level. As in Central Kalimantan, the access and quality interventions&#13;
would help reduce gender disparities in participation in junior secondary education where this&#13;
still exists.&#13;
3.27   Education Management. Like Central Kalimantan, West Kalimantan faces challenges&#13;
in monitoring and maintaining two-way communications with schools in remote areas. The&#13;
project would assist Kandeps/Kanin, and Kanwils, and the central MOEC in developing&#13;
better information systems for monitoring and planning. School administrators would also&#13;
receive inservice training. To support these interventions, the project would finance local and&#13;
overseas technical assistance; incountry training; computers and other equipment; the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                           29&#13;
development, printing, and purchase of materials; office supplies; and computer software to&#13;
support. To support project management in West Kalimantan, the project would finance&#13;
administrative operational costs and salaries, incountry training, and local and overseas&#13;
technical assistance.&#13;
3.28   Central Management Support (estimated base costs of $4.8 million). The project&#13;
would support this coordinating and advisory role of the central MOEC directorate for&#13;
primary and secondary education in Jakarta. The project would fund technical assistance,&#13;
local staff training, and operational costs for project management, public information,&#13;
monitoring, supervision, and evaluation for these offices. This coordinating unit, funded&#13;
initially under this project with supplementary funding as necessary under future projects,&#13;
would also assist with the implementation of other proposed Bank-funded projects under the&#13;
junior secondary education program, particularly the East Java and East Nusa Tenggara&#13;
Junior Secondary Education Project. Computers and the development and maintenance of&#13;
Dikmenum's management information systems would also be provided, particularly to&#13;
enhance its communications and joint planning efforts with each of the Kanwils.&#13;
Project Supportfor Private Education&#13;
3.29   The project would devote a substantial amount of resources to improve the quality&#13;
and management of private education. This would help reduce the disparity between public&#13;
and private education and encourage parents to view private schooling as a worthwhile&#13;
option. Specifically, private schools would benefit directly from: (a) funding of contract&#13;
teachers for rural schools; (b) teacher in-service training; (c) provision of teaching equipment&#13;
and materials; (d) provision of reference and library books; (e) provision of building materials&#13;
for community construction of student dormitories and teacher residences at isolated schools&#13;
in Kalimantan; (f) management training for school principals; and (g) support for innovative&#13;
quality initiatives to be piloted in Yogyakarta province. In addition, private schools would&#13;
benefit indirectly from such project activities as improved Kanwil management, monitoring,&#13;
and evaluation of schools and students; and the construction of public schools, whose&#13;
facilities are often used after-hours for private schooling through teacher associations. The&#13;
effectiveness of public assistance would be increased by reducing abuse of public support&#13;
through better monitoring of schools. Self-supporting "equivalent" private schools and rent-&#13;
seeking private schools would not receive project funding, while viable schools with the&#13;
potential to increase enrollment and quality would receive support at about twice the level of&#13;
previous Government efforts.&#13;
3.30 These efforts are in line with Government policy (explicitly stated in Repelita VI) that&#13;
private schools should maintain and even increase their share of total junior secondary&#13;
enrollments. The public sector already devotes significant amounts of resources to support&#13;
and improve the quality of private schools.  Government support currently includes&#13;
secondment of public sector teachers to private schools, distribution of approved textbooks&#13;
free of charge, and operational cost subsidies to private schools at the lower end of financial&#13;
viability. Funding is usually lower for quality inputs such as teacher training and distribution&#13;
of equipment, so project financing in such areas would expand the regular program (See&#13;
Annex 12).&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
30                Central Indonesia Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
D.  PROJECT ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
3.31   The economic analysis conducted for the project consisted of: (a) analysis of&#13;
educational demand and the rationale for public investment in junior secondary education;&#13;
(b) fiscal analysis; (c) review of alternatives; and (d) cost-benefit analysis. Details are&#13;
provided in Annex 7.&#13;
3.32   There are both efficiency and equity grounds for additional public intervention in&#13;
junior secondary education in Indonesia today. It is primarily the poor and near-poor (and&#13;
mostly those in rural areas) who are not enrolling in school and whose participation declined&#13;
in the late 1980s to early 1990s. One of the primary factors explaining the low demand during&#13;
that period is the high direct costs of education. A second factor is indirect (opportunity) costs&#13;
which exacerbated the effect of high direct costs. Coupled with stagnant real wages in the&#13;
1980s and the effects of cuts in public expenditure on basic education in the mid-1980s&#13;
(school construction came to a virtual halt), these factors contributed to faltering demand. The&#13;
past two years have seen the reversal of these trends as enrollment rates have risen&#13;
significantly in all provinces.&#13;
3.33   Since investment in junior secondary education is desirable on both efficiency and&#13;
equity grounds, the key questions for the Government are the budgetary implications of the&#13;
expansion and how to expand the system. The budgetary implications of the expansion are&#13;
sizable ($7.6 billion; see Annex 7 and para. 1.9), but estimation shows that the policy is&#13;
attainable if the economy continues to grow at the rate attained in recent decades, additional&#13;
funds are made available to junior secondary including external borrowing (para. 1.9), and the&#13;
private sector retains its current significant share.&#13;
3.34   Analysis of alternatives considered the role of the private sector in the expansion&#13;
program and the fiscal implications of mainly public expansion versus one which made room&#13;
for private expansion at the current rate of 40 percent of enrollments in private schools. The&#13;
budgetary implications double in the first scenario ($14.5 billion compared to $7.6 billion).&#13;
There are additional merits to preserving the private sector. First, given the current and&#13;
projected surplus of teachers, a robust private sector is an effective means for helping to clear&#13;
the market for teachers. Second, Madrasah schools (religious schools which currently enroll&#13;
about 20 percent of junior secondary students) offer access to junior secondary in small, poor&#13;
communities and at a cost that is significantly lower than even MOEC-supervised private&#13;
schools. These schools also enroll a higher proportion of girls than boys, reflecting the&#13;
preference pattern of some families for non-secular education. Third, maintaining the share of&#13;
private schools at the junior secondary level establishes the basis for sustaining the even&#13;
larger share of private schools at the senior secondary level (54 percent of enrollments in&#13;
1993/94).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
StaffAppraisal Report                              31&#13;
3.35   Beyond the public/private alternatives, the Government has experimented with&#13;
alternative modes of delivering junior secondary education (in respect of the regular SMP&#13;
model). These include SMP Kecil and SMP Terbuka. While not entirely substitutes for each&#13;
other (or to the regular SMPs), and experimentation to improve their quality is still ongoing,&#13;
preliminary unit cost comparisons indicate that gains can be achieved by utilizing these less&#13;
costly alternative models of junior secondary education in rural and remote areas.&#13;
3.36   The economic rate of return for the project investment is estimated by province and&#13;
component (increasing access and enhancing quality, but excluding the management&#13;
component). The estimates are obtained by solving for the internal rate of return that equates&#13;
a stream of benefits and costs resulting from the investment over a thirty year horizon. The&#13;
benefits of the projects are derived from the increased numbers of students enrolled in junior&#13;
secondary in any given year, but also include the additional stream of students expected to&#13;
proceed to senior secondary and tertiary education. A monetary value of the benefits of each&#13;
stream of beneficiaries is estimated using the difference in wages between one level of&#13;
education and the next. Benefits will also accrue from investments in enhancing the quality of&#13;
junior secondary. A benchmark assumption of a 15 percent additional wage premium earned&#13;
by a higher quality graduate is made. High returns were found for both quality and access&#13;
components, with returns on quality enhancements generally higher than for expansion of&#13;
access, particularly in Central Kalimantan and West Kalimantan, as noted in Table 3.1 below:&#13;

+ Provision of scholarships to poor and capable students. No additional building of school places will be carried out by project.&#13;
3.37   Simulations were run varying some of the underlying assumptions. In all, the main&#13;
variables to which the system appears to be most sensitive to are those affecting quality. This&#13;
is not surprising given the large numbers of beneficiaries which are impacted by this&#13;
investment. Sensitivity analysis reveals, for example, that (a) the rate of return for quality&#13;
inputs declines from 23 to 18 percent in West Kalimantan if only a 10 percent increase in&#13;
additional wage premium for higher quality graduates is assumed; (b) the rate of return&#13;
declines from 23 to 20 percent if incremental recurrent costs for quality improvements in&#13;
West Kalimantan increases from $8 per student to $10; and (c) the rate of return for access&#13;
inputs in Central Java increases from 18 to 19 percent if the junior secondary-primary wage&#13;
differential increases by 20 percent.&#13;

32               Central Indonesia Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
Impact on Poverty&#13;
3.38   Those not enrolled in junior secondary today are predominantly from the lowest four&#13;
income deciles. The project will reach these poor and near-poor through its poverty-targeted&#13;
sub-components. Scholarships will be awarded annually to approximately 34,000 poor (and&#13;
capable) students. Smaller schools in Kalimantan and regular schools in Central Java, a total&#13;
of 45,000 school places, will be built in rural areas, with priority given to the poorest villages.&#13;
Another 11,000 places in alternative programs, which are free to parents, will benefit areas&#13;
where direct and opportunity costs are highest. In all, the project will contribute to offsetting&#13;
the geographical and financial obstacles barring poorer children from junior secondary&#13;
schools, thus reducing social inequality in education access.&#13;
Impact on Women&#13;
3.39   Enrollment figures by province reveal no great disparities between male and female&#13;
participation in junior secondary education in the four project provinces. In 1994/95, females&#13;
accounted for 48-50 percent of total enrollment in the provinces and about 49 percent of the&#13;
cohort populations. Kabupaten-level data suggest that there may be somewhat more&#13;
significant disparities in certain pockets of the project provinces, particularly in rural areas.&#13;
In some kabupaten of Central Java and Central Kalimantan, for example, females account for&#13;
42 to 45 percent of total enrollment. Distance from home to school is one of the main reasons&#13;
for local disparities - parents are often reluctant to allow their daughters to travel far to&#13;
school. The following components can be expected to improve female access to junior&#13;
secondary schools: (a) expansion of school places in rural areas, where female&#13;
participation is lowest; (b) significant expansion of the SMP Kecil in rural communities&#13;
in the Kalimantan provinces; (c) expansion of SMP Terbuka programs in Kalimantan and&#13;
Central Java; (d) scholarships to low-income students, with priority given to girls; and (e)&#13;
quality improvements at private schools, including Madrasahs which usually has a higher&#13;
female enrollment.&#13;
E.  PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Institutional Background&#13;
3.40   Project design and the proposed management arrangements for this project are firmly&#13;
rooted in lessons of experience from earlier Bank-financed education projects, especially the&#13;
Second Secondary Education and Management Project (Loan 3158-[ND), which included a&#13;
pilot operation on which the design of the proposed project is based. During preparation the&#13;
emphasis has been on institutional changes: (a) strengthening participatory features;&#13;
(b) strengthening province-level implementation with respect to sector analysis, project&#13;
design and implementation; and (c) strengthening the national-level implementation capacity.&#13;
Because of the importance of these elements for project design, they are summarized below&#13;
and discussed in detail in Annex 13.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
StaffAppraisal Report                            33&#13;
Participatory Features&#13;
3.41   Beneficiary participation has been a major element of project design. A milestone&#13;
was reached in this respect in December 1994 when the Secondary Education Directorate&#13;
(Dikmenum) with Bank assistance conducted a two-day seminar with a large group of&#13;
stakeholders. This seminar helped: (a) define the objectives of the earlier pilot project and its&#13;
successor (the proposed project); (b) review options for project management structures and&#13;
responsibilities; (c) review options for implementation procedures; and (d) especially, seek a&#13;
consensus among seminar participants on implementation of the above.&#13;
3.42   Subsequent sectoral analysis and project development under the proposed project has&#13;
built on experiences from this workshop. Several workshops on sectoral issues, project&#13;
design and institutional framework have subsequently been conducted at different times and&#13;
locations. The result is a series of provincially organized project proposals that have been&#13;
developed with major involvement from the stakeholders: province- and district-level&#13;
education officers (Kanwils and Kandeps/Kanin), parent organizations (BP3), schools and&#13;
educational societies (yayasans).&#13;
3.43   Beneficiary participation will continue throughout project implementation. During&#13;
implementation, communities will participate in project development through regular&#13;
meetings at the sub-district level attended by members of parents' associations (BP3), school&#13;
principals, village chiefs, religious leaders, and community social-service workers. These&#13;
meetings will propose and evaluate possible project activities appropriate to local conditions&#13;
and consistent with local needs. Sub-district proposals would be submitted through the&#13;
Kandep/Kanin to the Provincial Project Implementation Unit (PPIU) for its review against&#13;
agreed criteria and possible inclusion in the project.&#13;
3.44   A key concept of the proposed project is that detailed annual work programs would&#13;
be prepared each year. The costs and details of the outer implementation years would not be&#13;
considered firm until an annual budgeting and evaluation process has taken place through a&#13;
bottom-up planning process each implementation year. This process is consistent with&#13;
existing Government procedures, but under the proposed project the involvement of project&#13;
beneficiaries in this process would be explicitly strengthened.&#13;
Province-Level Implementation&#13;
3.45   Provincial Structure. Provincial involvement in sectoral analysis and project design&#13;
has shown that there is a rapidly growing capacity to implement the proposed project. During&#13;
preparation, Kanwil staff conducted sectoral analyses, commissioned preparation reports from&#13;
lower administrative tiers, and appraised and revised these reports prior to discussions with&#13;
Bank missions. Because of these rapidly developing human capabilities, the project would be&#13;
implemented through existing line authorities at the Kanwil level. There would be no&#13;
expansion of staff positions, and the administrative structures would remain unchanged.&#13;
Project-specific task forces, commensurate with the focus and complexity of each of the four&#13;
provincial sub-projects, would be established and disbanded as and when necessary during&#13;
project implementation. This concept is not only viable: it embodies the ongoing concept of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34                Central Indonesia Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
empowering and engaging provincial staff in sectoral analysis and project preparation. (See&#13;
Annex 13 for Terms of Reference and the organizational structure for project management at&#13;
the provincial level.)&#13;
3.46   To lend a focal point to the operation, the Kakanwil, would be the Project Director. A&#13;
senior staff (such as Kabid-Dikmenum or someone under his/her supervision) would be the&#13;
Project Manager and would be responsible directly for implementation and management of&#13;
the project. A high-level Provincial Project Advisory Committee, headed by the head of the&#13;
Kanwil would give guidance to project implementors.  The committee would include&#13;
members from the senior-most tiers of the public and private provincial education system and&#13;
other Government agencies (see Annex 13 for membership). A technical resource group in&#13;
each province would assist in technical matters. It would have access to consultants and other&#13;
expertise as required.&#13;
3.47   Under the PPIU there would typically be the following five divisions to carry out the&#13;
following functions: (a) Procurement and Civil Works; (b) Quality Improvement;&#13;
(c) Accounting; (d) Progress Monitoring; and (e) Supervision and Evaluation. During&#13;
negotiations, the Government gave assurances that it would establish by November 1, 1996&#13;
(i) a Provincial Project Advisory Committee and (ii) a Provincial Project Implementation&#13;
Unit in each of the project provinces.&#13;
3.48   Review and Criteria for Annual Project Activities. The  PPIU would review&#13;
submitted proposals against explicit and well-advertised criteria. On completion of its review&#13;
in October each year, the PPIU would: (a) discuss the technical merits and scope of the&#13;
proposals with a Bank mission; and (b) submit the results and the proposed next-year budget&#13;
to the Provincial Project Advisory Committee for its approval.  Before submission to&#13;
Bappenas, the Provincial Project Advisory Committee would submit the proposal for&#13;
endorsement by the national education authorities in Jakarta to ensure consistency with&#13;
agreed Government and Bank policies, criteria, procedures and project magnitudes.&#13;
3.49   Selection  criteria would  include: (i) completeness; (ii) relevance; (iii) cost-&#13;
effectiveness; (iv) sustainability; and (v) implementability. Proposals would be reviewed for&#13;
completeness to test whether they are sufficiently developed to constitute sub-projects with&#13;
clearly defined objectives, inputs, costs, timetables and action plans. The relevance of the&#13;
submitted proposals would be tested against any of the stated objectives of the project,&#13;
especially poverty reduction, and taking into account known implementation constraints. The&#13;
cost-effectiveness merits of submitted proposals would be tested against alternatives for&#13;
delivering comparable educational service. The long-term sustainability of the proposals&#13;
would be tested against their implications for recurrent costs in the Government's budget, and&#13;
their likely implications for long-term effects on households in the affected communities.&#13;
The implementability of the submitted proposal would be reviewed against institutional,&#13;
managerial and other non-financial constraints.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                        35&#13;
National-level Implementation&#13;
3.50   Guided by a Central Program Advisory Committee, Dikmenum would be the&#13;
principal national level project implementation agency (see Annex 13 for proposed&#13;
organizational structure and Terms of Reference). Its role would be that of project oversight&#13;
and facilitation -- not implementation.  Dikmenum  would: (a) ensure that provincial&#13;
implementation focuses on achieving agreed project objectives; (b) assist the provinces in&#13;
establishing appropriate annual work plans; (c) help ensure timely preparation of regional&#13;
project budgets (DIP); (d) assist in establishing appropriate management information systems&#13;
at Kanwil and national levels; (e) disseminate pertinent information to the provinces; and (f)&#13;
identify or provide technical assistance to the provinces to ensure compliance with agreed&#13;
project-specific rules and regulations.&#13;
3.51   Dikmenum would help design and implement national and provincial capacity-&#13;
building plans as the project unfolds. This would include establishing appropriate project&#13;
information systems and procedures on the principle that relevant information from one&#13;
system would feed into the next system, and that there would be meaningful back and forth&#13;
flow of information across administrative levels. These would include: (a) budgeting&#13;
systems; (b) accounting; (c) procurement; (d) process indicators; and (e) project outcome&#13;
indicators. During negotiations the Government gave assurances that it would establish by&#13;
November 1, 1996 (i) a Central Program Advisory Committee and (ii) a Central Program&#13;
Coordination Unit.&#13;
3.52   Budgeting Systems. All project budgets (the DIP -- Government and Bank) would&#13;
be channeled annually to the provinces in accordance with normal Government investment&#13;
budgeting procedures.  The provinces would arrange payments to contractors through&#13;
standard Government procedures. Payments would be authorized by provincial Treasury&#13;
offices of the Ministry of Finance in accordance with existing well-established procedures.&#13;
During negotiations the Government provided assurances that it would, not later than&#13;
October I each year (beginning in 1997), furnish to the Bank for comments a report on the&#13;
implementation of the budget for the past and current fiscal years, and the proposed budget&#13;
for the following fiscal year.&#13;
3.53   Project accounts. Accounts would be established in such a way that meaningful&#13;
information about unit costs of project activities could be obtained as the project progresses.&#13;
To assist in this, an Indonesian accounting firm would be hired for a period of about three&#13;
months.&#13;
3.54   Procurement Documents and Procedures. The Central Program Coordination Unit&#13;
(CPCU) in Dikmenum would establish appropriate procurement documents and procedures&#13;
under the proposed project and provide appropriate technical assistance in this respect to the&#13;
provinces. This process has started with respect to the procurement documents for equipment&#13;
which were developed under the pilot part of the Second Secondary Education and&#13;
Management Project (Loan 3158-IND).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36               Central Indonesia Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
3.55  Project Implementation Handbook.  For the day-by-day practice of project&#13;
implementation, the CPCU, PPIU and Kandep/Kanin staff will rely upon a Project&#13;
Implementation Handbook. Written in Bahasa Indonesia, the Handbook will describe in&#13;
details and in concrete terms the methodology, procedures and multiple steps of project&#13;
implementation and project monitoring. Its content will draw mostly from the Staff Appraisal&#13;
Report and Legal Documents, GOI and Bank procurement and disbursement guidelines, and&#13;
will seek to emulate the best practices in the country. The Handbook is expected to: (a)&#13;
become the key and uniform point of reference for all levels of project management; (b)&#13;
provide users with ready answer for problem solving; and (c) offset the relative lack of&#13;
experience with project management at the provincial level. Dikmenum is coordinating the&#13;
preparation of the handbook.&#13;
F.    MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
Performance Indicators&#13;
3.56   Process Indicators. An Implementation Monitoring System would in part be fed by&#13;
information from the accounting system. It would also include information about non-&#13;
financial progress in the project, such as deliveries of educational materials and numbers of&#13;
teachers trained.&#13;
3.57   Project Outcome Indicators.  The outcomes of the proposed project would be&#13;
monitored throughout its implementation through four key indicators. In addition to the&#13;
above education indicators, the efficiency of various parts of the system would be measured&#13;
through ongoing econometric studies.&#13;
3.58   The project's performance indicators (Annex 15) were discussed and agreed with the&#13;
Government during negotiations. Progress in implementing the project is to be assessed&#13;
through monitoring indicators and formative evaluation using the detailed performance&#13;
indicators. Additionally outcome indicators have been identified to guide development&#13;
impact evaluation. Dikmenum would undertake the monitoring and formative evaluation as&#13;
well as required technical audits. The above indicators would also form the basis of&#13;
supervision by the Bank (the supervision plan is summarized in Annex 16).&#13;
Reports&#13;
3.59   Progress Reports. The PPIU in each of the project provinces would prepare half&#13;
yearly reports on project implementation which would include a description of&#13;
implementation of each component including discussion of any issues, delays or changes; an&#13;
updated list of performance indicators; actions on recommendations of the previous Bank&#13;
Supervision Missions; a list of all contract activities, and a set of tables covering:&#13;
expenditures, training and technical assistance activities, civil works activities, and an update&#13;
of project the implementation schedule. Annex 14 provides guidelines for preparation of the&#13;
progress report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                          37&#13;
3.60   Annual and Midterm Reviews. The timing of the annual review will be coordinated&#13;
with the annual budget preparation cycle. The first review will cover the period up to March&#13;
31, 1998. These reviews will summarize the status of project interventions, project activities&#13;
on the basis of project indicators, major implementation problems, and the revised&#13;
implementation plan for the following year. The midterm review and assessment will be in&#13;
October 1999. During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that it would&#13;
implement policies and procedures to enable adequate project monitoring and evaluation in&#13;
accordance with agreed indicators and (i) prepare a report by July 31 each year (beginning&#13;
in 1997) on monitoring and evaluation activities during the previous year and&#13;
recommendations for the following year; (ii) prepare a midterm report on or about July 31,&#13;
1999; and (iii) discuss these reports with the Bank by October 31 of the same fiscal year.&#13;
3.61   Implementation Completion Report. At the completion of the project, MOEC&#13;
would compile an Implementation Completion Report within six months of the closing date&#13;
of the loan. This report will summarize, among other things, (a) program activities in terms&#13;
of input, process, and output indicators; (b) an assessment of project activities; (c) the&#13;
project's financial status; and (d) implementation issues and recommendations.  During&#13;
Negotiations, the Government agreed to furnish to the Bank within six months after the&#13;
project closing date a plan designed to ensure the continued effectiveness of the project&#13;
objectives.&#13;
3.62   Technical Audits. To ensure accountability to the Government, the World Bank,&#13;
schools, and the general public, a technical audit of the various project components would be&#13;
performed annually. The technical audit would be carried out by an independent consultant&#13;
with no association with the project and employing specialists with expertise in (a) secondary&#13;
education administration and finance in Indonesia; (b) the management and distribution of&#13;
project inputs; (c) school construction; and (d) educational equipment and materials. The&#13;
goal of the technical audits would be to provide an independent and impartial assessment of&#13;
the quality and adequacy of procedures and processes employed by MOEC in Jakarta and the&#13;
project provinces.  The audit team would examine the efficiency and effectiveness of&#13;
implementation by the provinces and the support provided by the center. The team would&#13;
also assess to what extent project inputs are being distributed to target areas and groups&#13;
according to agreed criteria. The team would examine whether Kanwil and Kandep/Kanin&#13;
staff are performing as reported, whether they have the skills required, and whether&#13;
equipment and technical assistance provided are adequate and being used as reported. The&#13;
audits would include a sample check of documentation and selected site visits (about two per&#13;
year) to compare reality in the field against reports submitted and to ensure compliance with&#13;
accounting, procurement, and reporting guidelines. At negotiations, the Government provided&#13;
assurances that it would carry out annual technical audits of project implementation and&#13;
provide them to the Bank no later than six months after the end of the fiscal year.&#13;
3.63   Studies. Evaluation studies of the project processes and outcomes would be included&#13;
in the project to enable GOI and the Bank to assess the impact and cost effectiveness of this&#13;
project and related projects. A monitoring and evaluation expert will help GOI design the&#13;
studies to help measure the effect of the project's quality and access components on target&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38               Central Indonesia Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
populations. Other measures that would be employed include user surveys and studies by&#13;
anthropologists on the effect and appropriateness of project interventions in local settings.&#13;

4. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
A. PROJECT COSTS&#13;
4.1    The total cost of the project is estimated at US$154.1 million equivalent (Rp 359.3 billion),&#13;
including price contingencies and identifiable taxes and duties. Tables 4.1 and 4.2 summarize the&#13;
estimated costs by project component and by category of expenditure. Annex 18 shows further&#13;
details on project costs.&#13;
4.2    Bases of Cost Estimates. Base costs are estimated using April 1996 prices. Construction&#13;
costs are based on the most recent cost estimates per square meter of simple construction that the&#13;
Government planning ministry (Bappenas) publishes each year for each district (kabupaten). An&#13;
allowance of 8 percent over the latest (1994) figures has been included to update the estimates.&#13;
Science and office equipment costs are based on recent costs available from the Second Secondary&#13;
Education and Management Project. Learning and teaching materials costs are based on similar items&#13;
recently procured in other education projects in Indonesia. Costs for domestic consultants are in line&#13;
with recent education projects for appropriately qualified experts. Costs of travel, per diem and&#13;
honoraria are consistent with current Government figures and recent education projects and have been&#13;
agreed between the Bank and the Government. Costs for short-term in-country training are derived&#13;
from experiences in the Second Secondary Education and Management Project. These costs vary&#13;
widely by the type of training, travel distance and training, ranging from $35 to $200, averaging&#13;
about US$50. Scholarship grants are about $130 per person-year.&#13;
4.3    Contingency Allowances. The project consists of a large number of items of small&#13;
monetary value. Because the exact number of these items is not vital to the success of the project, no&#13;
physical contingencies have been included. Price contingencies (US$22.8 million equivalent, which&#13;
represents 17% of total baseline costs) have been calculated at 8.7 percent per year for local costs&#13;
and 2.4 percent per year for international costs.&#13;
4.4    Foreign Exchange Costs. Foreign exchange costs have been estimated at US$35.9 million&#13;
(representing about 23 percent of total costs). These costs are based on the following percentages:&#13;
(a) construction and fumiture, 30 percent; (b) equipment, 70 percent; (c) foreign consultants, 80&#13;
percent, (d) in-country training, learning and teaching materials and travel costs, 15 percent; and&#13;
(e) local consultancies, 10 percent.&#13;
4.5    Taxes and Duties. Identifiable taxes and duties are estimated at US$6.5 million equivalent&#13;
based on the current 10 percent value added tax on all goods and materials. It would be financed&#13;
entirely by the Government of Indonesia.&#13;

B. FINANCING&#13;
4.6    Financing Plan. The project would be financed by a proposed loan, covering 70 percent of&#13;
total project costs excluding taxes (100 percent foreign and 58 percent of local expenditures). The&#13;
Government would finance the balance of project costs including taxes from its annual budgets. The&#13;
incremental recurrent costs of the project would represent a negligible share of the education budget&#13;
of the project provinces; representing 1 percent for Central Java and less than 2 percent for both West&#13;
and Central Kalimantan (Annex 7). As there will be no expansion in Yogyakarta, the incremental&#13;
cost would be insignificant, related only to the quality of education.&#13;

C. PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.7    Organization and Management of Procurement. The procurement section of the Kanwil&#13;
Office in each province would be in charge of procurement under the general guidance of the&#13;
designated project manager (Pimpro) in each province. Whenever necessary (such as in the case of&#13;
conducting ICB), the procurement section at the provincial (Kanwil) level could request the&#13;
assistance of specialized expertise from the MOEC Secondary Education Directorate (Dikmenum) in&#13;
Jakarta.&#13;
4.8    With the exception of community-based construction (which would be organized by the&#13;
communities themselves), all construction activities would be organized through the Public Works&#13;
offices mostly in rural areas. These would be for small, scattered construction contracts totaling&#13;
/a Includes expenditures for travel, per diem, allowances and consumable materials, but excludes GOI staff&#13;
salaries for project implementation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                              45&#13;
about 800 contracts. About 200 of these contracts would be for 3-9 room schools, the remaining 600&#13;
contracts would be smaller still. About 75 percent of these contracts would be less than US$50,000&#13;
equivalent. All contracts would be carried out through the use of procurement procedures and&#13;
documentation acceptable to the Bank at the provincial level. For contracts between US$50,000 and&#13;
$200,000 these rules would be National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures based on the Bank's&#13;
Standard Bidding Documents for Small Works, translated into Bahasa Indonesia. Bidding against a&#13;
known reference price would be permitted and foreign bidders would be allowed to participate.&#13;
Procurement of small works estimated to cost less than US$50,000, would be carried under local&#13;
procurement rules with which all participants in Indonesia are familiar. Despite the fact that these&#13;
rules deviate in some respects from the Bank's preferred rules, they are acceptable to the Bank in this&#13;
case, given: (a) the tiny size of these contracts; (b) their scattered nature on hundreds of project sites;&#13;
and (c) the fact that these works would be carried out two administrative levels down from the&#13;
Central Government in Jakarta.&#13;
4.9    A built-in procurement supervisory function (para 4.11) would help ensure that the bid&#13;
openings would be public and that all the agreed procurement rules would be carried out. With&#13;
respect to bid methodology, the planning directorate in Jakarta (Bappenas) keeps and publicizes an&#13;
annually updated list of reference prices for the m2 construction of different types of construction in&#13;
each district (kabupaten). These unit prices include site works and fees related to the management,&#13;
design and supervision of construction. Because the bidding documents spell out the number of&#13;
square meters to be constructed and the unit costs (per m2) are known, the bidding is done against a&#13;
known reference price. With respect to bid evaluation, only those bids that are in the "brackets"&#13;
between the reference price plus 10 percent (top), and 90 percent of the reference price (bottom) are&#13;
considered to be responsive bids. Other bids are rejected as non-responsive. This practice would be&#13;
accepted for all contracts to be awarded under the project (all of which are expected to be less than&#13;
$200,000).&#13;
4.10   Construction Procedures and Criteria. Rules for the size and nature of construction items&#13;
to be included in the project have been tentatively agreed with the Borrower. These include, that&#13;
when building new schools or adding rooms to existing ones, the ratio of auxiliary rooms to the total&#13;
number of classrooms at each school would be as follows: Three room schools would be entitled to&#13;
receive a small administrative unit. In such schools the teachers room would double as a library. Six&#13;
room schools would be entitled to a standard-size administration block and a library. "Full-sized"&#13;
(nine-classroom) schools would follow standard Government designs. The design of other rooms&#13;
would also be in accordance with the existing, publicized standard designs for such rooms.&#13;
4.11   Construction Procurement Oversight. The construction activities for the Project would be&#13;
supervised from Dikmenum in Jakarta by a local consulting architect/engineer who would be hired by&#13;
this project for the duration of all the project. This project-hired supervisor would be central to the&#13;
success of the construction components. The supervisor would be a technical link between local&#13;
monitors in the procurement section in each Kanwil, the PCU in Jakarta and the Bank, including in&#13;
particular its procurement staff in the Resident Mission in Indonesia (RSI). The TORs of this person&#13;
would be to: (a) ensure that the agreed procurement rules are understood and adhered to by all&#13;
provincial parties; (b) train Kanwil-level education staff in monitoring and reporting on construction-&#13;
related activities; (c) keep PWD technical staff in each kabupaten informed about the Bank's&#13;
requirements with respect to procurement of construction; and (d) review the bidding procedures and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

contract awards of about 110 contracts over the life of the project, and determine that it was&#13;
implemented in accordance with agreed the agreed rules and proceduresa/.&#13;
4.12   Procurement Methods. All procurement of goods and works would be done in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's Guidelines for procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, dated January 1995&#13;
and revised in January 1996. The loan proceeds would be used to finance the procurement of goods,&#13;
works and services as follows:&#13;
4.13   School construction activities, totaling about US$25.0 million for contracts equal to or&#13;
exceeding US$50,000 each would be procured under NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
Contracts estimated to cost less than US$50,000 each and totaling US$27.0 million would be&#13;
procured from domestic contractors under lump-sum, fixed-price contracts awarded on the basis of&#13;
written invitations to at least three qualified contractors, or through a publicly extended invitation to&#13;
qualified domestic contractors. The head of the procurement section in the Kandep office of the&#13;
MOEC in each province would negotiate annually with the public works department (at the DTNAS-&#13;
level) to have the annually agreed works carried out within each year's budget period.&#13;
4.14   In many parts of Kalimantan, the least cost alternative to retain teachers and students is&#13;
through dormitory construction. In the interest of the sustainability of the project, accommodation&#13;
construction activities (totaling about US$5.9 million) would be carried out under the auspices of&#13;
community organizations (such as BP3). This refers specifically to the construction of project-&#13;
financed teacher and student residences in parts of Kalimantan. Communities that meet agreed&#13;
criteria for such construction (see Attachment to Annex 10) would be re-imbursed for the cost of&#13;
materials. All labor would be provided by the community.&#13;
4.15   Procurement of equipment, furniture and consumable materials for contracts equal to or&#13;
exceeding US$200,000 each, and totaling about US$10.0 million would be carried out through ICB,&#13;
using the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for the Procurement of Goods. To the extent&#13;
practicable, contracts for these goods would be grouped in bid packages estimated to cost&#13;
US$200,000 equivalent or more. This procurement would be-in accordance with methods, principles&#13;
and documents that have already been tested and carried out under the Second Secondary Education&#13;
and Management Project (Loan 31 58-IND). These principles include: (a) involving the end-users in&#13;
the preparation of the equipment lists for their schools; and (b) making the suppliers of the equipment&#13;
responsible for distributing the equipment to the end-users. Any further lessons learned from the&#13;
ongoing bid evaluation and forthcoming contract performance would be incorporated into future&#13;
bidding documents under the proposed project. Under ICB bidding, local manufacturers would be&#13;
granted a margin of preference of 15 percent of the CIF price, or the import taxes and duties which a&#13;
non-exempt importer would have to pay, whichever is lower. Contracts costing less than $200,000&#13;
up to an aggregate of US$4.0 million including taxes could be procured through NCB procedures&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. Small and diverse items, costing less than US$50,000 and totaling US$5.1&#13;
million may be procured through national shopping based on at least three price quotations.&#13;
a/ This would include about 80 percent of contract awards under NCB procedures and about 10 percent spot-&#13;
checking of contracts awarded following simplified procurement procedures with three price quotations. About&#13;
one half of this review would be done through desk-reviews in Jakarta. Spot-checks and reviews of noted&#13;
irregularities would necessitate field reviews for the remaining 50 percent. RSI would carry out a second review&#13;
of about 20 percent of the work of the procurement consultant.&#13;

Staff Appraisal Report                           47&#13;
4.16   Because of their availability from  single sources only, books and earlier published&#13;
educational materials, totaling US$16.9 million, would, with the Bank's prior agreement, be procured&#13;
from publishers or local distributors through direct contracting. Printing services for project-specific&#13;
educational materials costing less than US$50,000 each and aggregating less than US$2.5 million&#13;
would be procured through national shopping with at least three price quotations. There would be no&#13;
larger contracts for this purpose. Together these items are estimated to cost a total of US$19.4&#13;
million.&#13;
4.17   Local training contracts totaling about US$20.5 million would be awarded to local providers&#13;
in accordance with Government administrative procedures, acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
4.18   Overseas training contracts totaling about US$1.4 million would be awarded in accordance&#13;
with Government administrative procedures, acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
4.19   Consultant services and studies totaling about US$6.6 million would be selected and&#13;
contracted in accordance with Bank guidelines on the use of consultants. About US$3.6 million of&#13;
this would be for the provinces, the balance (US$3.0 million) for project management and&#13;
supervision from Jakarta. Annex 19 shows the technical assistance plan. All training and consultancy&#13;
contracts would use the standard form of contract for consultants' services.&#13;
4.20   Scholarships totaling about US$16.1 million would be awarded in accordance with agreed&#13;
criteria in accordance with Government administrative procedures, acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
4.21   Contract teachers totaling about US$4.7 million would be selected in accordance with&#13;
the criteria and procedures agreed with the Bank.&#13;
4.22 Operating costs totaling about US$4.9 million would be met following Government&#13;
administrative procedures, acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
4.23   Reviews. As shown in the following table and further detailed in Annex 20, there would&#13;
be a large number of small to medium size contracts for goods and works (&lt;US$200,000) to be&#13;
awarded under the proposed project:&#13;

4.24   Because of the nature of the project, most of these contracts would be awarded two&#13;
administrative levels down from Jakarta. Reviews by the Bank would therefore be costly and&#13;
would be limited to the following:&#13;
(a)    Each contract for goods estimated to cost the equivalent of US$200,000 or more,&#13;
125 randomly selected contracts for goods estimated to cost less than $200,000,&#13;
the first ten civil works contracts in each Fiscal Year in Central Java, and the first&#13;
five civil works contracts in each Fiscal Year in each of Yogyakarta, Central&#13;
Kalimantan and West Kalimantan would be subject to prior review. The prior&#13;
review would cover about 25 percent of all contract awards, including all&#13;
contracts awarded under ICB. Other contracts would be subject to random ex-&#13;
post review. Review arrangements for construction are also discussed as a part of&#13;
the organizational arrangements for construction (para 4.11).&#13;
(b)    All terms of reference, single-source selection of consulting firms and all consultant&#13;
contracts valued at or over $100,000 for firms and at or over $50,000 for individuals&#13;
would be subject to prior review by the Bank. All other consultant contracts would be&#13;
subject to random ex-post reviews.&#13;
(c)    Fellowships contracts would be subject to random ex-post reviews; and Annual&#13;
Implementation Plans and Budgets would be subject to annual reviews and&#13;
discussions between the Government and the Bank.&#13;
4.25   There would be no contract exceeding US$5 million under this project. For contracts not&#13;
subject to prior review, post review of such contracts would be carried out by RSI staff&#13;
supported by the procurement consultant in PCU (para 4.11). For new implementing agencies,&#13;
one out of five such contracts would be post-reviewed for the first year of implementation,&#13;
followed by one out of 20 such contracts in succeeding years. Annex 20 shows the procurement&#13;
plan for the project by province.&#13;

D. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
4.26   The proposed loan of US$104.0 million equivalent would be disbursed over a period of about&#13;
five and a half years (Annex 21). The project is expected to be completed by December 31, 2001,&#13;
and the loan would be closed six months later on June 30, 2002. The disbursement schedule is based&#13;
on the implementation schedule and disbursement profile for Indonesia. Disbursement estimates for&#13;
the first semester of FY97 are based on the proposed initial deposit into the Special Account.&#13;
Disbursements would be made as follows (US$ million):&#13;
(1) Civil Works                 US$35.2        70% of total expenditures&#13;
(2) Goods                       US$33.1        100% of foreign expenditures, 100% of&#13;
local expenditures (ex-factory cost) and&#13;
65% of expenditures for other items&#13;
procured locally.&#13;
(3) Training:&#13;
(a) Local                    US$9.9         50% of total expenditures&#13;
(b) Overseas                 US$1.4         100% of total expenditures&#13;
(4) Operational Costsa'         US$4.9         100% of total expenditures&#13;
(5) Scholarships                US$8.0         50% of total expenditures&#13;
(6) Contract Teachers           US$3.7         80% of total expenditures&#13;
(7) Consultants' Services:&#13;
(a) Provinces                US$3.4        100% of total expenditures&#13;
(b) Other                    US$2.3        80% of total expenditures&#13;
Unallocated                     US$2.1&#13;
Total                           US$104.0&#13;
4.27   Disbursements from the loan account for the following contracts would be made against full&#13;
documentation: (a) goods contracts valued at or more than US$200,000; (b) civil works contracts&#13;
valued at or more than US$200,000; and (c) individual consultant services contracts valued at or&#13;
more than US$50,000 and consulting firms contracts valued at or more than US$100,000. All other&#13;
disbursements would be made against statements of expenditures (SOE) for which the relevant&#13;
documentation would be retained by each managing provincial office and made available for review&#13;
by visiting reviewers from Dikmenum and the Bank. To facilitate disbursements, a Special Account&#13;
in the amount of US$5.0 million equivalent would be established in Bank Indonesia. This Special&#13;
Account would be held in the name of the Director General of Budget, Ministry of Finance,&#13;
Includes expenditures for travel, per diem, honoraria &amp; consumables.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                            51&#13;
following established procedures. The Special Account would be used for all payments authorized&#13;
by Provincial/Kabupaten offices of the Ministry of Finance. The Special Account would be used for&#13;
all eligible foreign and local expenditures. Replenishment of the Special Account would be made on a&#13;
monthly basis or when 20 percent of the initial deposit has been used, whichever occurs first.&#13;
E. ACCOUNTS AND AUDITS&#13;
4.28   Based on submissions in an agreed standard format from each province, the CPCU in&#13;
Dikmenum would prepare a consolidated financial report. The provincial financial statements and&#13;
financial reports for each fiscal year would be audited by independent auditors acceptable to the&#13;
Bank, including a separate audit opinion on SOE expenditures. Certified copies of the financial&#13;
report on each provincial sub-project for each Government fiscal year, together with the auditors'&#13;
statements would be furnished to the Bank as soon as available, but not later than six months after the&#13;
end of each Government fiscal year starting March 31, 1997. During negotiations, the Government&#13;
provided assurances that it would (i) maintain adequate project records and accounts; (ii) have them&#13;
audited each year; (iii) furnish to the Bank the audit report not later than six months after the end of&#13;
the fiscal year;and (iv) furnish to the Bank other requested information concerning records, accounts&#13;
and audits.&#13;
4.29   Dikmenum  has the primary responsibility to monitor all project activities and routine&#13;
monitoring would be done through annual reviews. However, because a large number of contracts&#13;
would be financed under SOE procedures, an independent, qualified firm with external technical&#13;
assistance would be hired to conduct technical audits of key project activities. The above audits&#13;
would cover activities in progress and post reviews of completed actions to examine whether&#13;
implementation of the various project components are technically appropriate and to recommend&#13;
corrective measures if necessary. The procurement oversight activities referred to in para 4.11 would&#13;
form an input into these technical audits. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that&#13;
it would (i) maintain adequate records and accounts for all project expenditures made on the basis of&#13;
statements of expenditure, (ii) retain records concerning those expenditures for at least one year after&#13;
the Bank has received the final project audit report; (iii) allow the Bank to examine such records;&#13;
and (iv) ensure the annual audit contains a separate opinion on these records and accounts.&#13;

5. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. BENEFITS&#13;
5.1    The benefits of the proposed project derive from  meeting the high demand for junior&#13;
secondary education where it exists and stimulating demand where it may be constrained due to low&#13;
income and/or credit market failures. The expected outcomes of the investment are: (a) increased&#13;
numbers of higher quality junior secondary graduates; (b) more students at higher levels of education&#13;
as approximately 80 percent of junior secondary graduates proceed to the next level and another 30&#13;
percent continue to tertiary education; (c) poverty reduction and greater distribution gains in the&#13;
economy as a result of focused junior secondary education improvement for low income and rural&#13;
students; (d) externalities derived from girls' education such as lower fertility, increased prenatal care&#13;
utilization, their families' improved health and nutrition status and children's higher educational&#13;
attainment; (e) greater professional qualification of teaching and managerial staff; and (f) better&#13;
quality data on students' and schools' performance.&#13;
5.2    Outcomes (a) and (b) above are generated as a result of the increased access and enhanced&#13;
quality that the project investment will ensure. Table 5.1 below presents the stream of beneficiaries&#13;
as a result of access and quality interventions over the next ten years (see Annex 7, Section IV for&#13;
details).&#13;

Impact on Poverty&#13;
5.3    The project will contribute to offsetting the geographical and financial obstacles barring&#13;
poorer children from junior secondary schools, thus reducing social inequality in education access.&#13;
Those not enrolled in junior secondary today are predominantly from the lowest four income deciles.&#13;
As described in Chapter 3, the project will reach these poor and near-poor through its poverty-&#13;
targeted sub-components. Scholarships will be awarded to poor (and capable) students. Schools will&#13;
be built in rural areas, with priority given to the poorest villages. Additional places in alternative&#13;
programs, which are free to parents, will benefit areas where direct and opportunity costs are highest.&#13;
In all, the project will contribute to offsetting the geographical and financial obstacles barring poorer&#13;
children from junior secondary schools, thus reducing social inequality in education access.&#13;

StaffAppraisal Report                               53&#13;
Impact on Women&#13;
5.4    The following components can be expected to improve female access to junior secondary&#13;
schools: (a) expansion of school places in rural areas, where female participation is lowest;&#13;
(b) significant expansion of the SMP Kecil in rural communities in the Kalimantan provinces;&#13;
(c) expansion of SMP Terbuka programs in Kalimantan and Central Java; (d) scholarships to low-&#13;
income students, with priority given to girls; and (e) quality improvements at private schools,&#13;
including Madrasahs which usually has a higher female enrollment.&#13;
5.5    Although these actions can be expected to continue closing the remaining gaps between male&#13;
and female participation, progress should be monitored throughout the life of the project.&#13;
Impact on the Environment&#13;
5.6    The project would have no direct environmental effects and is classified as a Category C&#13;
project. The proposed project would positively effect the environment indirectly through greater&#13;
emphasis on environmental concerns in teacher training, the content of library books, and the&#13;
development of science education that makes students more aware of their natural world.&#13;
B. RISKS&#13;
5.7    The main risks associated with the proposed project are:&#13;
(a)    Private sector participation in junior secondary may decline in absolute or relative&#13;
terms which would have significant budgetary implications for the public sector. If&#13;
the share of the private sector in junior secondary enrollment declines but remains at&#13;
its current absolute level of about 3 million students (which means a decline in&#13;
relative share from the current 40 percent to about 20 percent), the budgetary shortfall&#13;
in the next five years would be twice the shortfall if the private sector retains its 40&#13;
percent share (see Annex 7, Section 1I for details). Furthermore, if private enrollment&#13;
is phased out (except for enrollment in religious schools), the budgetary shortfall in&#13;
the next five years would be three times the level of shortfall if the private sector&#13;
continues its significant role. The risk of the decline in the private sector participation&#13;
is partly mitigated by the involvement of project advisory committees at all levels&#13;
which represent stakeholders interests. This risk would also be mitigated by the&#13;
involvement of project steering committees at the central and provincial levels, and&#13;
the participation of the MOEC Directorate for private education in these committees.&#13;
(b)    The quality improvement component of the project may prove to be more costly and&#13;
take longer than initially planned, thus postponing or reducing its expected benefits.&#13;
The risks from the labor market side lie in not rewarding higher quality graduates&#13;
with a sufficiently high wage premium to generate the estimated economic rate of&#13;
return of the quality component of the project: the base case estimate of the economic&#13;
rate of return assumes that higher quality graduates will reap a 15 percent additional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54                 Central Indonesia Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
wage premium in the labor market. This generates a rate of return to quality ranging&#13;
from 16.5 for Yogyakarta to of 23 percent for West Kalimantan (see Annex 7, Section&#13;
IV). Sensitivity analysis indicates that a 10 percent (versus 15 percent) quality wage&#13;
premium will reduce the rate of return to 18 percent in West Kalimantan.&#13;
(c)   Implementation by PPIUs in the provincial and district offices operating in an&#13;
institutional environment still in transition to less centralized procedures. The issue&#13;
is to what extent local management can successfully implement these provincial&#13;
projects when budgets and all incentive systems, particularly in personnel&#13;
management, are under central control.&#13;
(d)    The lack of, or limited capacity at the provincial and district offices to manage all&#13;
aspects of the project implementation process without previous experience with Bank&#13;
requirements and procedures.&#13;
5.8    The proposed project would reduce the risks of&#13;
(a)    private decline by re-inforcing the mechanisms for school mapping in the project&#13;
provinces, so as to avoid construction of public schools in the catchment areas of&#13;
existing private schools, and by providing support to private schools (teacher training,&#13;
library books and teaching aids) to increase their role in the system and including the&#13;
private education representatives in the project advisory committees;&#13;
(b)    slower quality improvement by using training programs which have already a long,&#13;
positive track-record and supporting further improvement of these programs (such as&#13;
PKG for teacher training and the MOEC program for teacher-librarian training); and&#13;
by providing the PPIUs with detailed Terms of Reference;&#13;
(c)    ongoing deconcentration by confirming assurances from the Government that it is&#13;
committed towards the deconcentration of responsibilities, and that it will set up:&#13;
(a) PPIUs in each project province to manage the project at provincial level in&#13;
coordination with Kandeps (district offices); and (b) a Central Program Coordination&#13;
Unit designed to provide technical assistance and to monitor and assess project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
(d)   insufficient implementation experience by providing assistance (launch seminar and&#13;
training, distribution of project implementation handbooks, coordination by CPCU,&#13;
national and international consultants) to the provincial PPIUs; establishing criteria&#13;
for inter- and intra-provincial equitable distribution of poverty-targeted components;&#13;
and provision of regular feedback from World Bank supervision missions.&#13;
C.    SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
5.9    The fiscal impact of the project on the four provinces is estimated below (see Annex 7,&#13;
Section II for details). The estimates are based on the following assumptions: (a) the education budget&#13;
in each province will increase at the national historical growth rate of GDP (6 percent per annum in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                               55&#13;
real terms); and (b) the share of the junior secondary education budget out of the total provincial&#13;
education budget would also have to increase during the capital-intensive phase.&#13;
Central Java&#13;
5.10   Based on the above assumptions, total project costs for Central Java (including physical and&#13;
price contingencies, and taxes) would account for about 6 percent of the Central Java education&#13;
budget, on average, during the project period (1996/97-2001/02). Incremental recurrent expenditures,&#13;
which are negligible in the first year of the project, increase from US$0.2 million in 1997/98 to&#13;
US$2.3 million in the last year of the project, and stabilize at US$2.5 million after the project is&#13;
completed, representing less than 1.0 percent of the education budget. Thus the long-term recurrent&#13;
cost implications of the project are small and manageable.&#13;
Yogyakarta&#13;
5.11   Total project costs for Yogyakarta would account for about 6 percent of the Yogyakarta&#13;
education budget, on average, during the project period.  Incremental recurrent expenditures are&#13;
negligible because no investment in additional student places will take place in Yogyakarta (other&#13;
investments which have recurrent cost implications such as the Management Information System&#13;
(MIS) is a very small part of the total).&#13;
West Kalimantan&#13;
5.12  In West Kalimantan, total project costs would account for about 14 percent of the province's&#13;
education budget, on average, during the project period. Incremental recurrent expenditures, which&#13;
are negligible in the first year of the project increase from US$0.1 million in 1997/98 to US$0.9&#13;
million in the last year of the project, and stabilize at about US$1.0 million after the project is&#13;
completed, representing less than 2.0 percent of the education budget. Thus the long-term recurrent&#13;
cost implications of the project are manageable.&#13;
Central Kalimantan&#13;
5.13   Total project costs for Central Kalimantan would account for about 15 percent of the Central&#13;
Kalimantan education budget, on average, during the project period.  Incremental recurrent&#13;
expenditures, which are negligible in the first two years of the project increase from US$0.14 million&#13;
in 1998/99 to US$0.7 million in the last year of the project, and stabilize at about US$0.8 million after&#13;
the project is completed, representing less than 2.0 percent of the education budget. Thus the long-&#13;
term recurrent cost implications of the project are manageable.&#13;
5.14  Institutional sustainability of the project is likely be greatly enhanced because of the&#13;
involvement of beneficiaries in project preparation, and by the project design which builds on&#13;
successful strategies suited to the variety of contexts in the project provinces. For many interventions&#13;
in all provinces under the project, local procedures and programs are being followed and improved to&#13;
ensure that implementors are familiar with and committed to the project's design. For example,&#13;
inservice teacher training is based on a system that the central MOEC and the provinces have&#13;
experience in implementing and that has been carefully designed and tested through years of fine-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
56                Central Indonesia Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
tuning. Rather than introducing a new system unfamiliar to provinces and teachers, the project will&#13;
focus efforts on improving the existing system. Teacher training will be supported and&#13;
institutionalized beyond the life of the project under the auspices of the broad network of MGMP&#13;
teacher associations.&#13;

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE JUNIOR SECONDARY EDUCATION PROGRAM AND&#13;
PROJECT&#13;
The economic analysis conducted for the Central Indonesia Secondary Education Project&#13;
consists of: (i) demand analysis and rationale for public investment in junior secondary; (ii) fiscal&#13;
analysis; (iii) analysis of alternatives; and (iv) cost-benefit analysis.&#13;
The economic analysis first aims to understand the determinants of demand for junior&#13;
secondary education in Indonesia particularly since there have been variations in the past decade and&#13;
there are significant disparities among socio-economic groups (Section I). This section establishes&#13;
that the main determinants of demand are household incomes, costs of schooling and distance to&#13;
school; the latter two are variables that Government can affect through this project. Therationale for&#13;
additional public investment in junior secondary is investigated subsequently (Section I), and it is&#13;
argued that on both efficiency and equity grounds, there are justifications for additional public&#13;
intervention in expanding junior secondary.&#13;
The cost implications of the Government's expansion program (Section II) are then&#13;
considered. A key element is the future role of the private sector in the provision of junior secondary&#13;
education. The conclusions reached are that a sizable budgetary effort will be required, but that the&#13;
policy is attainable if the economy continues to grow at its historical rate, additional funds are made&#13;
available to junior secondary including external borrowing and the private sector retains its current&#13;
large share.&#13;
The next question that arises is how best to provide junior secondary education. The&#13;
Government has at its reach both demand and supply policy instruments and within the latter several&#13;
alternative modes of junior secondary exist. These are analyzed in Section III.&#13;
Finally, the costs and benefits of the specific project design are laid out and an economic rate&#13;
of return is calculated (Section IV). The financial impact of the project on the provincial budgets and&#13;
prospects of sustainability is analyzed in Section II.&#13;
I. DEMAND ANALYSIS AND RATIONALE FOR PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN JUNIOR SECONDARY&#13;
Enrollment at the junior secondary level expanded rapidly between the late 1960's and&#13;
1980's, reaching 63 percent in gross terms in 1988 (47 percent NER).' For the next five years,&#13;
however, enrollment fell to 52 percent (41 percent NER) by 1993 (declining in absolute terms from&#13;
7.8 million to 7.1 million students). Recent data indicate a resurgence of demand in the lasttwo years&#13;

(GER and NER rose to 58 percent and 47 percent respectively by 1995) almost restoring the pre-&#13;
decline enrollment rates.&#13;
There remain significant differences in enrollments, however, among income groups and&#13;
urban-rural residents. In 1994, the net enrollment rate among the top quintile was 66 percent&#13;
compared to 25 percent for the lowest quintile.2 Significant differences also exist among urban and&#13;
rural enrollment rates: 62 percent of urban children aged 13-15 years old are in junior secondary,&#13;
compared to 33 percent of rural children. When decomposed by income and urban-rural levels,&#13;
enrollments are low for the poor and near-poor children in both rural and urban areas, and the middle&#13;
income rural children.3&#13;
High direct costs are one oQL the primary factors explaining the low junior secondary&#13;
enrollment rates among the poor and near-poor. Overall, the cost to families of educating a child in&#13;
junior secondary comes to an annual average of Rp210,000 (1994). This is more than two-and-a-half&#13;
times the cost of primary education (an average Rp8O,000).4 For households in the lowest quintile,&#13;
total expenditure per junior secondary student is equivalent to approximately 80 percent of per capita&#13;
household expenditure. Particularly significant are the up-front registration (entrance) fees that&#13;
parents must pay: in 1994, the average entrance fee for junior secondary was Rp47,500, which for&#13;
those in the two lower quintiles was five times more than the registration fee paid for primary&#13;
education.&#13;
Indirect (opportunity) costs of junior secondary education are significant in rural areas. and&#13;
this exacerbates the effect of high direct costs especially among the poor. Schools are in short supply&#13;
in rural areas which imposes high travel time and costs. The longer the travel time, the higher the&#13;
opportunity cost of schooling, and the more reluctant parents will be to send their children to school.&#13;
Though the difference between average travel time to primary school for urban versus rural residents&#13;
is insignificant, the national average travel time to junior secondary schools in rural areas is 50&#13;
percent higher than in urban areas.5 Earnings foregone while attending school can also be significant&#13;
among the poor.&#13;
Parents' decisions to send a child to junior secondary education depends on the&#13;
aforementioned costs and also on:&#13;
I)     income constraints and credit markets failure. The poor have not only low income but also&#13;
greater difficulty to borrow. Particularly in the area of human capital investments, the possibility of&#13;
borrowing is practically non-existent even among better off families. This implies that private&#13;
demand for junior secondary and, as a result, current enrollment, is lower than its social optimum.&#13;
2)     the benefits of junior secondary education. A  tangible benefit associated with junior&#13;
secondary education is the additional labor income that would accrue to the graduate compared to&#13;

(October 1995)&#13;

5 Ibid. Since travel times are reported by parents whose children are enrolled in school, they are likely to underestimate the&#13;
travel time families face when making a decision regarding whether or not to enroll their child. The survey reports average&#13;
travel time in rural areas of 30 minutes versus 19 for urban areas.&#13;

someone who left school after completion of primary education. Under normal (steady-state)&#13;
conditions, the wage differentials between primary and junior secondary education should reflect the&#13;
socially optimum amounts of education in the labor force rendering corrective action by the&#13;
government unnecessary. However, Indonesia is in a state of rapid transition. Examining the behavior&#13;
of the labor market, a conclusion that emerges is that formal sector employment is growing relatively&#13;
slowly (compared to education output) and wage differentials have been compressed (due to fast&#13;
growth in enrollment among the better off).6 These patterns give the short-term but false "signal" to&#13;
poor families that junior secondary education has neither direct wage rewards nor significant&#13;
employment prospects outside agriculture or the informal sector. Indeed, in the period 1988 to 1991&#13;
even absolute enrollments in junior secondary education declined. This disequilibrium phenomena&#13;
works against long-term investments, such as those in human capital, and justify Government support&#13;
to stabilize short-run variations and to steadily increase junior secondary enrollments.&#13;
3)     how farsighted parents are. Parents are making decisions today in light of the fact that jobs in&#13;
the formal sector are expanding at a lower pace than education (hence the aforementioned wage&#13;
compression and also the higher rates of unemployment among the educated). However, as the&#13;
economy approaches the turning point (expected to take place within the decade) and as has&#13;
happened in other NICs, the transformation of the economy from an agrarian one to one that relies&#13;
heavily on the education and productivity of its workers would be fast. At that point, corrective&#13;
action in the form of training is typically expensive. For example, it is estimated that training requires&#13;
7&#13;
six times the costs of basic education in order to achieve the same effect on productivity and wages.&#13;
4)     the prospects of continuing to senior secondary. Since junior secondary education is the&#13;
stepping stone for proceeding to senior secondary (and tertiary) education, families can give&#13;
consideration to the costs and benefits of completing senior secondary education. Thecost of senior&#13;
secondary is more than double that of junior secondary (Rp460,000 per year) and may in turn deter&#13;
parents from investing in junior secondary. Also, as with the earnings of junior secondary graduates,&#13;
the wage premium of senior secondary education has declined significantly over time.&#13;
In short, enrollments in junior secondary education can increase if direct costs of education&#13;
are reduced (such as through scholarships, fee reductions, etc.) and if indirect costs are alleviated&#13;
(e.g. through more and better geographical distribution of schools). On the benefit side, though little&#13;
can usually be done with the respect to how the relative supply and demand of educated/less educated&#13;
workers operate in the labor market, there are policies that increase the value of education through&#13;
improving its quality. Quality also affects the decision of parents to enroll their children and a child's&#13;
progress through school. There are improvements to be made on the input aspects of quality, for&#13;
example, 30 percent of junior secondary students still do not have mathematics textbooks. But the&#13;
more important (and complex) area of improvement appears to be in the process of how inputs are&#13;
combined to educate students and the interactions between teachers and students. Evidence on this&#13;
for junior secondary in Indonesia is scant, but findings from research conducted in primary schools&#13;
indicates that the problem may lie in the teacher's inability to identify, diagnose and address student&#13;
6 See Training and the Labor Market in Indonesia: Policies for Productivity Gains and Employment Growth, World Bank&#13;
(1996) Chapter 1. The wage premium for urban junior secondary graduates relative to primary have declined over the past&#13;
decade (while still positive) from 80 percent to 30 percent for males and 166 percent to 60 percent for females. (Ibid.)&#13;

progress in the classroom.  Another indicator of quality is the relative low  scores in reading&#13;
competency tests of Indonesian students by international standards.&#13;
Externalities.  Research from  other countries has pointed to the existence of positive&#13;
externalities such as reduced fertility and child mortality and improved nutritional status that&#13;
correlate with female secondary education.9 For Indonesia, survey results indicate that a mother's&#13;
education is an important determinant of prenatal care utilization: 25 percent of women with some&#13;
primary education do not use prenatal care compared to less than 10 percent of women with junior&#13;
secondary education.'0 Furthermore, analysis of nutritional status in Indonesia finds a strong effect of&#13;
maternal education on children's nutritional status: for women with between zero and five years of&#13;
education, an additional year of education has no impact on the child's nutritional status, while,&#13;
among women with six to twelve years of education (or more), an additional year of education&#13;
improves nutritional status significantly.' '&#13;

underinvestment in junior secondary and the externalities from women's education all point to the&#13;
need for greater public involvement. Though we do not quantify the extent of market failure&#13;
associated with these reasons (e.g., does credit market failure affect 10 or 10,000 poor children) some&#13;
additional insight may be gained by looking at social rates of return to education that have been&#13;
computed from 1986-1992. The estimates indicate that returns to junior secondary education are the&#13;
highest among other education subsectors (Table 1). Furthermore, while returns for all the subsectors&#13;
may have declined during this period, those for junior secondary saw the smallest reduction.&#13;

In conclusion, there are both efficiency and equity grounds for public intervention in junior&#13;
secondary education. The appropriate public interventions include building school facilities in rural&#13;
areas, providing scholarships to poor students, and enhancing quality.&#13;

for level of economic development and other factors, female secondary education is highly significant. Secondary education for&#13;
females reduces fertility and mortality in several ways: (i) by enhancing the opportunity cost of a woman's time in economic&#13;
activities relative to child-bearing; (ii) by promoting child health which in turn affects desired family size; and (iii) by&#13;
promoting more effective contraceptive use and willingness to use modern contraceptive methods.&#13;

II. FISCAL ANALYSIS&#13;
An analysis of the likely costs and implications for the public budget of achieving universal&#13;
enrollment in junior secondary education by the year 2010 is presented below. The fiscal impact of&#13;
this project is then estimated.&#13;
A. Fiscal Implications of the Junior Secondary Education Expansion Program&#13;
The overall education expenditure in Indonesia is currently reasonably balanced across&#13;
primary (46%), secondary (13% junior, 15% senior) and tertiary (13%) levels. However, it has been&#13;
subject to significant variations in the past and has not always been protected from budgetary cuts.&#13;
Indeed, public expenditure on education has declined over time as the graphs below demonstrate.'2&#13;
This is relevant in light of the Government's plans to achieve universal nine years of education,&#13;
which will require significant additional public resources to be spent on the junior secondary sub-&#13;
sector, as well as on primary education.13&#13;

Year                                             Year&#13;
Achieving universal junior secondary enrollment in 15 years is a formidable task as it&#13;
requires increasing enrollments by 1.8 times (from 7.5 million to 13.5 million). It is therefore&#13;
important to define the role of the public and private sectors. Currently, the ratio of public/private&#13;
enrollment is about 60/40. We evaluate the cost implications of three alternative public/private&#13;
scenarios, that is, universal junior secondary enrollment is achieved in year 2010 and:&#13;
1)     the public/private share stays at its current 60/40 ratio;&#13;
2)     private enrollment stays at its current 3.5 million/year; or&#13;
3)     private enrollment is phased out except for enrollment in religious schools which is assumed&#13;
to remain at its current level of 1 million students/year.&#13;
Under the 60/40 public/private scenario, enrollments in public schools are assumed to&#13;
increase annually by 240,000 students. Under the other two scenarios the annual increase will be&#13;
12 The last two years are preliminary estimates.&#13;
The exercise conducted here assumes that the graduation rate from primary school will increase from the current rate of&#13;
75% to 100%. This will require additional investments at the primary level to increase retention.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7. Page 6of 17                                71&#13;
400,000 and 533,000 students. In all scenarios it is assumed that the level of recurrent funding&#13;
remains at its present level of $110 per student/year which implies that there would be no quality&#13;
gains. Development costs (building new schools) are estimated to be around $900 per additional&#13;
student. To address credit market failures and enable expansion among the poor, it is assumed that 10&#13;
percent of additional students in excess of the current 7.5 million will receive a scholarship of&#13;
$90/year. Students enrolled in private schools are assumed to receive an average annual subsidy of&#13;
$40 per student to help raise the quality of private schools (Appendix Table B).&#13;
The results of the scenarios indicate that achieving universal basic education will have sizable&#13;
budgetary implications. Even if the current public/private ratio of 60/40 is preserved, this would&#13;
imply that public enrollment increases from 4.5 million to 8.1 million. What is required to finance&#13;
this expansion (which is desirable on both efficiency and equity grounds) is a combination of&#13;
significantly increased allocations to junior secondary education, a decline in the funding of other&#13;
education sub-sectors (such as senior secondary or tertiary education) unless there is an increase in&#13;
the overall education budget (if sectoral allocations are to be preserved, especially with respect to&#13;
primary education), and considerable funding from donors.&#13;
The estimates below indicate that under all scenarios a significant financing effort will be&#13;
required (Table 2). In addition, the difference in enrollments between the three scenarios point to a&#13;
substantial increase in total public costs if the private sector ceases to play the role it does today.&#13;
More specifically, the total additional public funds that would be required through year 2010 come to&#13;
about: $7.6 billion in the public/private scenario; $1 1.1 billion if the current level of private&#13;
enrollment is maintained; and $14.5 billion under the pure public scenario (if the private sector is&#13;
phased out except for religious schools).&#13;

How can the expansion be financed? Let us assume that the education budget increases&#13;
annually by 6 percent, that is, as much as the historic growth rate of GDP. This will add nearly $7.5&#13;
billion to the junior secondary education budget. Compared to the additional public funds required&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
72                                Annex 7: Page 7 of 17&#13;
for the expansion, this implies a shortfall of $543,000, $4 million and $7.4 million under the three&#13;
scenarios (Table 3). The last two scenarios appear unattainable, but the (60/40) public/private&#13;
scenario also has a caveat: it is heavily front loaded. More precisely, additional funding comes to&#13;
$].2 billion in the first ten years though no additional resources will be required thereafter when the&#13;
system reaches relative maturity (after year 2005 the percentage increases in public enrollments will&#13;
be significantly less than 6 percent growth in the budget). The (60/40) public/private scenario though&#13;
affordable at face value, will require additional funding of an average $120 million during the first&#13;
ten years of expansion (and considerably more, as much as $150-$200 million in the first five years).&#13;
The budgetary shortfall (in $ million) is shown graphically in Figure 3.&#13;

The three scenarios would require that the budgetary allocation to junior secondary education&#13;
increase from the current 13 percent of the education budget to approximately 16 percent, 19 percent&#13;
and 21 percent in the next few years (and in the case of the mainly public scenario it will have to&#13;

The cost estimates presented above incorporate estimates of scholarships for poor students&#13;
and subsidies paid to private schools. It is legitimate to plan for such public expenditure because&#13;
alleviating supply constraints (e.g., building schools in rural areas) will not alone remove demand&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
74                              4Annex 7: Page 9 of 17&#13;
constraints (that is, the opportunity cost of attending education). Assuming that the poorest 10&#13;
percent of the additional enrollment each year receives a scholarship of $90, the total cost of the&#13;
scheme over the 15 year period will come to an annual average of $29 million in all scenarios&#13;
(increasing from $3.6 million in 1996 to $54 million in 2010). In the public/private scenario,&#13;
scholarships will amount to 6 percent of the total public cost of expansion (ranging from 1.4 percent&#13;
in 1996 to 7 percent in 2010). On the other hand, the budgetary savings from phasing out private&#13;
schools and the subsidy they receive (assumed at $40/student) will be only $1.6 million/year. This&#13;
saving is small (I percent of the additional funds) and can prove counterproductive as it will take&#13;
place at the expense of the current co-financing of junior secondary education between Government&#13;
and families.&#13;
What do these estimates imply for the total public budget allocated to education relative to&#13;
GDP? Public expenditure on education is today approximately 2.7 percent of GDP. To fund the&#13;
expected expansion of junior secondary education this figure should increase to approximately 3.0&#13;
percent and 3.2 percent under the 60/40 public/private and pure public scenarios, respectively. These&#13;
figures assume that allocations to other sectors increase annually by 6 percent (GDP growth).&#13;
In conclusion, achieving universal enrollment in junior secondary is desirable on both equity&#13;
and efficiency grounds, but will require a sizable budgetary effort. The policy is attainable if the&#13;
economy continues to grow at its historical rate, additional funds are made available to junior&#13;
secondary including external borrowing, and the private sector retains its share.&#13;
B. Fiscal Impact of the Project&#13;
Utilizing the results of the above scenarios and assuming the 60/40 public/private case as the&#13;
"desirable" scenario, the fiscal impact of the project on the two provinces is estimated below. The&#13;
estimates are based on the following assumptions: (i) the education budget in each province will&#13;
increase at the national historical growth rate of GDP (6% per annum in real terms); and (ii) the share&#13;
of the junior secondary education budget out of the total provincial education budget would also&#13;
increase during the capital-intensive phase (as in the national scenario; see Table 4 above).&#13;
Central Java: Based on the above assumptions, total project costs for Central Java&#13;
(including physical and price contingencies, and taxes) estimated at US$68 million, would account&#13;
for about 6% of the Central Java education budget, on average, during the project period (1996/97-&#13;
2001/02). Incremental recurrent expenditures, which are negligible in the first year of the project&#13;
increase from US$0.2 million in 1997/98 to US$2.3 million in the last year of the project, and&#13;
stabilize at US$2.5 million after the project is completed, representing less than 1.0% of the&#13;
education budget. Thus the long-term recurrent cost implications of the project are small and&#13;
manageable.&#13;
&#13;

(including physical and price contingencies, and taxes) estimated at US$27 million, would account&#13;
for about 14% of the West Kalimantan education budget, on average, during the project period&#13;
(1996/97-2001/02). Incremental recurrent expenditures, which are negligible in the first year of the&#13;
project increase from US$0.1 million in 1997/98 to US$0.9 million in the last year of the project, and&#13;
stabilize at about US$1.0 million after the project is completed, representing less than 2.0% of the&#13;
education budget. Thus the long-term recurrent cost implications of the project are manageable.&#13;

III. ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES&#13;
A. Alternative Modes of Junior Secondary Education&#13;
GOI has available to it various alternatives to the regular (9 classroom) SMP school. These&#13;
include: SMP Kecil (small schools of 3 classrooms), and SMP Terbuka (open/distance school. An&#13;
analysis of their unit costs and effectiveness is presented below. Two words of caution are in order,&#13;
however: (i) the alternative programs are not perfect substitutes for each other or even to the regular&#13;
SMP (see below); and (ii) the programs are in an early stage of development, particularly the SMP&#13;
Terbuka and are undergoing continuous revisions, hence their unit costs and outcomes are expected&#13;
to change over time. The analysis below, therefore, is preliminary and will be updated during the&#13;
course of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
78                                 Annex 7: Page 13 of 17&#13;
Following is a characterization of the main advantages and disadvantages of each program:&#13;
Program                  Advantages                           Disadvantages&#13;
*  Better learning environment.     *  Higher investment cost than for other&#13;
*  More time-on-task in school.        options.&#13;
*  Preferred by community because it  *  Often required students to walk long&#13;
represents regular schooling.       distances&#13;
*  Employs unprepared multi-subject&#13;
SMP Kecil                                            teachers.&#13;
*  Might require student or teacher&#13;
accommodations&#13;
*  Is not free-of-charge (parents have to pay&#13;
for uniforms, entrance fees, exam fees,&#13;
BP3, etc.)&#13;
*  Free of charge.                  *  Requires a regular SMP as a basis&#13;
*  More flexible time.                 (mother school).&#13;
*  At end of course, students take  *  Less time-on-task at school.&#13;
SMP Terbuka       EBTANAS exam.                    *  Students have to travel to mother school&#13;
*  Uses regular teachers.           *  Requires discipline of self-study.&#13;
* All curriculum subjects are taught.&#13;
* Tutorials are held near student's&#13;
home.&#13;
Following are estimates of unit costs of each alternative program:&#13;
Unit Cost             Unit Cost&#13;
Program                    (Rps. per student    (Rps. per student p.a.)&#13;
p. a.) (with            (without&#13;
books/modules)        books/modules)&#13;
SMP Kecil 1/                   467,000                133,000&#13;
SMP Terbuka                    360,000                100,000&#13;
I/ including amortization of building.&#13;
As mentioned above, the three alternatives are not perfect substitutes. SMP Terbuka needs a&#13;
9-classroom regular SMP school within reasonable distance to function as a mother school, providing&#13;
subject matter teachers. Thus the program cannot be introduced in very remote areas where regular&#13;
SMPs are not available. An SMP Kecil, always accepted despite some of the draw-backs in terms of&#13;
teachers' quality, requires a capital investment (and subsequent maintenance and amortization). In&#13;
addition, MOEC has to find regular teachers willing to stay in remote areas.&#13;
LearningAchievement It is difficult at present to compare learning achievement between the&#13;
two types of schooling. SMP Terbuka is a very recent program; NEM scores exist for only one year,&#13;
thus there is limited basis for analysis. So far, only one comparative study of learning achievements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7: Page 14 of 17                                 79&#13;
has been conducted.14 Students in the sample, subdivided into two groups according to whether they&#13;
had just entered the program (Group I) or they had attended the program for one year (Group II),&#13;
were administered the same test, which gave the following mean test results:&#13;
Program                        Group I           Group II&#13;
Regular SMP                       42.5              51.3&#13;
SMP Terbuka                       31.1              34.3&#13;
Students of SMP Terbuka scored the lowest grades. The study further calculates the "gain points&#13;
average" for each alternative, which shows that the highest gain was obtained by the regular SMP,&#13;
followed by SMP Terbuka.&#13;
The above mentioned study represents one case study and should not be considered as&#13;
conclusive. As the three alternative programs are further developed under the project (and other&#13;
projects such as the Non-formal Education Project), they will be monitored and outcomes measured&#13;
in order to produce more conclusive conclusions.&#13;
B. Public versus Private Provision of Junior Secondary Education&#13;
A second analysis of alternatives is that covered under Section II on the role of the private&#13;
sector. The earlier discussion highlighted the budgetary implications of the expansion program if the&#13;
role of the private sector declines. There are additional merits to preserving the private sector. First,&#13;
given the current and projected surplus of teachers, a robust private sector is an effective means for&#13;
helping to clear the market for teachers. Second, madrasah schools (religious schools which currently&#13;
enroll about 20% of junior secondary students) offer access to junior secondary in small, poor&#13;
communities and at a cost that is significantly lower than even MOEC-supervised private schools.&#13;
These schools also enroll a higher proportion of girls than boys, reflecting the preference pattern of&#13;
some families for non-conventional education. Third, maintaining the share of private schools at the&#13;
junior secondary level establishes the basis for sustaining the even larger share of private schools at&#13;
the senior secondary level (54% of enrollments in 1993/94).&#13;
IV. COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS&#13;
The economic rate of return for the project investment is estimated by province and&#13;
component (increasing access and enhancing quality, but excluding the management component).&#13;
The estimates are obtained by solving for the internal rate of return that equates a stream of benefits&#13;
and costs resulting from the investment over a thirty year horizon.&#13;
Table 9 presents the rates of return for the four project provinces by component. The returns&#13;
range from 15 percent to 18 percent for the provinces, and from 12 percent to 23 percent for the&#13;
components. In Central Java and Yogyakarta, there is little difference between the rate of return to&#13;

of Out-of-School Education, Youths and Sports, MOEC, 1995. The Paket B Program is similar to the SMP Terbuka and is&#13;
financed from other sources.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

increasing access and enhancing quality signaling the profitability of both investments, albeit at a&#13;
lower rate for Yogyakarta. The return in Central Java are high for both components, consistent with&#13;
the rapid economic shifts and high levels of demand in Central Java.&#13;
By contrast, in both Central and West Kalimantan, the rates of return to enhancing quality (20&#13;
and 23 percent, respectively) are significantly higher than increasing access (12 and 14 percent,&#13;
respectively). The high dropout rates in the Kalimantans determine to a large extent the low return to&#13;
the access component (since as explained below, an assumption made was that dropouts do not&#13;
accrue an additional wage premiums).&#13;
While the rate of return for quality improvement in Yogyakarta appears low relative to the&#13;
other provinces, this can be expected given the more advanced (and costly) nature of the quality&#13;
interventions in Yogyakarta. Yogyakarta serves as the leader in Indonesia in experimentation and&#13;
piloting of new methods, as well as the link to the international community.&#13;

* Provision of scholarships to poor and capable students. No additional building of school places will be carried out by project.&#13;
The remainder of the section explains how the estimates were made and provides an&#13;
indication of the sensitivity of the estimates to some of the underlying assumptions.&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
Increasing Access.   The project investments are expected to lead to an increase in the&#13;
number of students enrolled in and graduating from junior secondary in any given year. Most junior&#13;
secondary graduates, however, do not stop at this level: nationally about 84 percent proceed to senior&#13;
secondary and another 30 percent proceed to tertiary. Thus, the stream of output resulting from the&#13;
project investments is modeled as a function of the following five levels of outflows:&#13;
1. Junior secondary graduates;&#13;
2. Junior secondary graduates who proceed to senior secondary and subsequently&#13;
drop out;&#13;
3. Junior secondary graduates who succeed in graduating from senior secondary;&#13;
4. Senior secondary graduates who proceed to university and subsequently drop out; and&#13;
5. University graduates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7: Page 16of 17                                      81&#13;
The total number of the above outflow over a thirty year period amounts to approximately&#13;
864,000 beneficiaries (Table 10). 15 The benefits of each of the beneficiaries are estimated as the&#13;
difference in wages between one level of education and the next. No additional wage premiums are&#13;
assumed to accrue to dropouts (they earn the same wage as that of the education level they drop&#13;
from). Provincial data on wages, drop out rates (by grade), and transition rates are utilized in the&#13;
estimation of outflows and benefits.16&#13;

Enhancing Quality. Investments to enhance quality will extend to (a high proportion of)&#13;
existing students as well as the new students generated by the project. Over the thirty years of the&#13;
calculation, the total number of quality beneficiaries amount to approximately 5.59 million. We&#13;
assume that a 15 percent additional wage premium can be earned by higher quality graduates&#13;
(equivalent to about an extra $1.5-2.5 per month, depending upon provincial wages).&#13;
B. Coqst&#13;
Investment costs are divided into those related to increasing access and those which enhance&#13;
quality, for each of the four provinces. They are spread over six years, with very little investment in&#13;
the first year of the project, followed by several years of heavy capital outlays and tapering off in the&#13;
sixth year. A provincial average annual per student recurrent cost is imposed throughout the project&#13;
and subsequently for the remaining twenty-five years (amounting to about $100). Similarly, annual&#13;
recurrent costs for senior secondary and university education are added to total costs since a&#13;
significant portion of the benefits accrue as a result of junior secondary students proceeding up the&#13;
system. On the quality side, an increment of $8 is assumed to represent the recurrent cost of&#13;
additional quality improvements. No quality enhancements are factored for senior secondary and&#13;
tertiary.&#13;
These outflows assume that there will not be a capacity constraint at the senior secondary and higher education levels.&#13;
Give the rapid growth of the private sector at these levels in the past decade, this assumption is not unreasonable to make&#13;
(coupled with some additional public investment).&#13;
In cases where provincial wage rates are not reliable, national wages were used as an approximation.&#13;
&#13;

C. Sensitivity to Assumptions&#13;
Simulations were run varying some of the underlying assumptions. Below are the results for&#13;
selected provinces.&#13;

$1 0/student:&#13;
West Kalimantan                         20% (23%)&#13;
In all, the main variables to which the system appears to be most sensitive to are those&#13;
affecting quality. This is not surprising given the large numbers of beneficiaries which are impacted&#13;
by this investment.&#13;

OPTIONS FOR INCREASING ACCESS&#13;
To increase access to junior secondary education, a variety of strategies will be&#13;
employed according to their appropriateness in each of the provinces, including activities to:&#13;
(a) increase the number of places in public schools in order to meet demand; (b) provide cost-&#13;
effective alternative solutions besides traditional schools in targeted areas; (c) support low-&#13;
income junior secondary students through scholarships; and (d) other strategies to increase&#13;
access including the provision of accommodation at existing schools for students who live&#13;
too far to travel.&#13;
Increasing Places in Public Schools. To increase the opportunities for junior&#13;
secondary education, building or expanding traditional junior secondary schools as well as&#13;
developing the small SMP, or SMP Kecil, are the first options. Each of these options will be&#13;
appropriate and cost-effective only in certain circumstances and will be introduced when&#13;
compatible with local conditions in each of the provinces, as determined by specific criteria&#13;
drawn up by each province.&#13;
Regular SMP and SMP Kecil. Standard building designs for regular SMPs call for 9,&#13;
18, or 27 classrooms. In densely populated areas, regular SMPs remain the obvious solution&#13;
to increase access. However, schools of standard size are too large to serve rural areas with&#13;
small, scattered populations, which nevertheless have sufficient cohort populations to justify&#13;
a new small school. To increase access in these areas, the Government plans to use the SMP&#13;
Kecil, which has fewer than nine classrooms. There would be fewer teachers than the usual&#13;
requirement (at least five subject teachers for this type of schools). The main advantage of the&#13;
SMP Kecil is that it would allow the services of traditional schools to be provided to&#13;
underserved areas with small numbers of potential students.&#13;
In some situations, SMP Kecils are an appropriate and cost-effective option for&#13;
expanding education. General criteria used by the provinces for the establishment of an SMP&#13;
Kecil include: (a) a number of local feeder schools would ensure a minimum of about 30&#13;
graduates per year; (b) except for those students provided with dormitories, the maximum&#13;
distance for students to reach the school should be 5 kilometers or, alternatively, a one-hour&#13;
trip; (c) the school should guarantee the availability of at least three teachers, with&#13;
qualifications among them to teach math, science, Bahasa Indonesia, social sciences, local&#13;
content, and English; (d) rural, remote and poor areas are given priority; (e) priority is given&#13;
to kabupaten and kecamatan with the lowest gross enrollment or transition rates; and&#13;
(f) schools should not be in areas served by an existing public or private school. Once the&#13;
decision is made, teachers would be offered added incentives to teach in isolated areas (e.g.,&#13;
accommodation where appropriate) and education authorities would provide a minimum set&#13;
of teaching aids. An attachment shows the criteria for school location.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 10: Page 2 of 4                            91&#13;
Education for Difficult Areas. Some areas have an insufficient number of feeder&#13;
primary students within a reasonable distance, or a large number of young people who are not&#13;
able to attend school at normal times for work-related reasons. In other instances, youth do&#13;
not attend school because parents cannot afford to pay for school expenses. The expansion of&#13;
access by means of regular schools will not catch these potential students.  Flexible,&#13;
community-based schooling that requires no separate infrastructure development is often part&#13;
of the solution. At present the Government offers programs, parallel to regular secondary&#13;
education, such as the SMP Terbuka program (open secondary schooling). SMP Terbuka&#13;
programs do not charge fees to students. Criteria for applying these programs are similar to&#13;
the ones for the SMP Kecils in terms of walking distance. A minimal class size of about a&#13;
dozen students would suffice. These programs would target the rural population in distant&#13;
areas, where the establishment of a "small" school is not feasible, and would represent the&#13;
minimum educational service that education authorities needs to provide to these areas.&#13;
SMP Terbuka. The SMP Terbuka program, now in operation for only the second&#13;
year, is conceived as a major alternative for school-age children who fail to enter a regular&#13;
public school because of financial difficulties in entering a public or private school, low&#13;
grades in the end-of-level Ebtanas examinations, and/or lack of facilities in the area.&#13;
Students in Terbuka programs are free only at certain times of the day, often in the mornings&#13;
- most of them help their parents in farming, fishing, or home chores. In most cases,&#13;
students attend classes in a regular SMP in the afternoons once or twice a week (a total of&#13;
three to four hours), with teachers from the "mother" SMP school. Four or five other&#13;
afternoons in the week, students do their home assignment, using specially prepared modules,&#13;
in a learning post in the village under the supervision of a tutor.&#13;
Such alternative programs as SMP Terbuka meet a need in deprived areas: they do&#13;
not involve high costs for parents (practically only transportation), are flexible in the timing,&#13;
and do reach a certain percentage of out-of-school youngsters. The main weaknesses are (a)&#13;
the often low qualifications and competence of tutors; (b) the relatively high costs of&#13;
transportation, which adversely affect attendance in some cases; (c) the qualifications of&#13;
students attending these programs, many of whom are bound to be those with low&#13;
achievement in primary schools; (d) a shortage of student modules; and (e) reduced class&#13;
attendance and contact with qualified teachers compared to regular SMP. Some parents&#13;
recognize these weaknesses and reject SMP Terbuka because it is not a "regular" school.&#13;
To improve the quality and effectiveness of the program: (a) tutors would be given&#13;
intensive training (at present Terbuka tutors attend only a 5-day training course, which&#13;
appears inadequate); (b) village chiefs, parents, and community members would be sensitized&#13;
and mobilized to ensure that students do attend tutorial classes regularly; (c) transportation&#13;
costs in particularly difficult or remote areas would be subsidized by the Government; and&#13;
(d) consideration should be given to increasing the length of the program; (e) students will be&#13;
required to pass the Ebtanas final examination like other regular SMP students;&#13;
(f) Government is considering providing subsidies to students with good learning&#13;
achievements to compensate for direct and opportunity costs. The effectiveness of the&#13;
Terbuka program will be evaluated during the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Scholarship Program. Families in the lower income deciles bear large financial&#13;
burdens when their children attend junior secondary school, relative to the total monthly&#13;
family expenditures (between 40% and 80%). These costs include school registration fees,&#13;
tuition, parental contributions, expenses for unifroms, transport, books and other costs.&#13;
Furthermore, children from poor families attending school incur additional costs in the form&#13;
of foregone income they could earn within or outside the household. Simulations, based on&#13;
econometric modeling indicate that abolishing school fees would raise the transition rate&#13;
from primary schools to junior secondary by 12%; subsidizing all school-related direct costs&#13;
would raise the rate by 32%, primarily bringing into school those children, whose parents&#13;
value education, but cannot afford to pay.&#13;
GOI is currently operating a nationwide scholarship program covering some 27,000&#13;
junior secondary students. The scholarship consists of financial support amounting to&#13;
Rp 25,000 per month for nine months, an ample amount to cover all school-related costs. A&#13;
new fund distribution mechanism has recently been implemented, with funds being&#13;
distributed through the post office. The fund provides scholarships to children of low&#13;
economic background and satisfactory academic achievement and personality. Within these&#13;
criteria, preference is given to children from remote areas, orphans and girls. The fund is&#13;
operating well, and though very limited, is much appreciated.&#13;
It is proposed in the project, to expand the scholarship program to cover a much&#13;
larger target group, to make a greater impact in bringing poor children into SLTP. The&#13;
current program would be augmented, with adaptations as follows: (a) scholarships would be&#13;
provided to 12,200 students for Central Java, 1,700 for Yogyakarta, 1,160 for Central&#13;
Kalimantan, and 2,100 for West Kalimantan; (b) unit costs would be set at Rp 25,000 average&#13;
per student per year; and (c) a simple monitoring mechanism will be implemented to make&#13;
sure that funds reach the recipients intact and that selection criteria are followed. By project&#13;
mid-term review, the entire program will be evaluated for impact. An attachment to this&#13;
Annex contains details of the criteria for award and monitoring the program.&#13;
Other Strategies to Increase Access. In addition to these strategies to increase&#13;
access by expanding the number of places in junior secondary education, the Government has&#13;
proposed other measures including supporting community construction of student&#13;
dormitories to increase opportunities for dispersed populations in rural areas. In many such&#13;
areas, students have already built, on their own, temporary accommodation, often of poor&#13;
quality and often beyond the financial resources of parents. The project would support their&#13;
efforts. Dormitories would be located according to priority in areas with low enrollment&#13;
rates, where such accommodation is culturally acceptable.&#13;
The lack of teachers in such areas is also a problem, and quality expansion relies on&#13;
attracting and retaining adequately trained staff. Options include increasing the number of&#13;
teachers in underserved areas through redeployment and support for the construction of&#13;
teacher accommodation. In many rural areas, there is no accommodation provided and none&#13;
to be rented. In some cases, communities have built teacher "messes", or small flats,&#13;
especially for single teachers. Such efforts could be encouraged and supported through funds&#13;
for materials and technical assistance to needy communities that are willing and able to carry&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 10: Page 4 of 4                             93&#13;
out the construction. An attachment describes criteria for providing financial assistance for&#13;
student dormitories and teacher accommodation.&#13;
The Project would also pilot a scheme for hiring contract teachers in schools in the&#13;
rural areas (see attachment). Schools would be given contract positions for teachers, to&#13;
allow them to hire new teachers when a teacher leaves their position without authorization.&#13;
This would reduce turnover and absenteeism. Similarly, a teacher rotation scheme in West&#13;
Kalimantan which provides for teachers to take work in rural areas for given periods, would&#13;
be supported by the project.&#13;

COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IN CIVIL WORKS&#13;
1.    In the interest of the sustainability of the project, accommodation construction&#13;
activities would be carried out under the auspices of community organizations (such&#13;
as BP3). This refers specifically to the construction of project-financed teacher and&#13;
student residences in parts of Kalimantan.&#13;
2.    Communities that meet agreed criteria for such construction would be reimbursed for&#13;
the cost of materials (excluding taxes) out of the project account.&#13;
3.    All labor would be provided by the community.&#13;
Procedures for Providing Financing for Accommodation Construction&#13;
1.    Priority shall be given to those Kabupaten, and those Kecamatan within such&#13;
Kabupaten, with the lowest gross enrollment and transition rates from SD/MI to&#13;
SLTP/MTs.&#13;
2.    Teacher dormitories shall only be built in rural. remote and poor areas, where teachers&#13;
do not have access to suitable accommodation at a reasonable distance from school.&#13;
3.    The request for teacher and student dormnitory construction shall be submitted to the&#13;
Kakanwil through Kakandep, and such proposal shall include evidence of land&#13;
availability and assurance of affordability for dormitory maintenance.&#13;
4.    The request for teacher and student dormitories shall be culturally and socially&#13;
acceptable&#13;
5.    For student dormitories, the distance between the residence of the pupils and the school&#13;
poses a serious constraint with respect to transport and access. The proposed school&#13;
dormitory shall serve SD/MI graduates in the surrounding areas.&#13;
6.    Preference shall be given to students living far away from the school and of poor&#13;
background.&#13;

INSERVICE TEACHER TRAINING STRATEGY&#13;
Introduction&#13;
The PKG Program. The Directorate of General Secondary Education (Dikmenum)&#13;
began programs to strengthen the quality of secondary education more than 20 years ago, but&#13;
the main initiative has been the Pemantapan Kerja Guru (PKG) program, which started&#13;
working with science teachers in 1980. The program was extended to cover teachers of four&#13;
other major subjects (mathematics, English, Bahasa Indonesia and geography) during the&#13;
1980s. For its first five years, PKG was supported by a UNDP/UNESCO grant, but since&#13;
1984 activities have been funded through two joint Government of Indonesia/World Bank&#13;
projects (the First and Second Secondary Education and Management Projects).&#13;
Two major characteristics defined PKG training:&#13;
*  Inservice instruction at the training center was supported by follow-up visits to&#13;
participants' schools (onservice training);&#13;
*   Teacher educators from the Teacher Training Institutions (IKIPS and FKIPs)&#13;
made a substantial contribution to subject-content learning; but responsibility for&#13;
the practical aspects of the training program, including the onservice visits, was&#13;
in the hands of experienced teachers (instructors).&#13;
Before starting PKG work, new instructors received specially-designed short courses&#13;
in Malaysia, Singapore, the United Kingdom, or Australia. Subsequently, selected instructors&#13;
undertook more extended courses overseas; and more than 80 of them now hold masters'&#13;
degrees in pedagogy of their teaching subject.&#13;
Originally, all PKG training was delivered through a single model, sometimes&#13;
referred to as PKG (murni) pure. A PKG murni training cycle ran for 16 weeks, during&#13;
which participants (i) received two two-week blocks of inservice training, at a provincial&#13;
center; (ii) took part in approximately 12 weekly meetings; and (iii) received three onservice&#13;
visits at their schools. The main focus during the inservice blocks was on subject content,&#13;
during the weekly meetings, on lesson planning and feedback; and during the onservice&#13;
visits, on practical application in the classroom.&#13;
Sanggar PKG. During the mid-1980s, a second less-intensive model was introduced&#13;
to disseminate PKG approaches more rapidly, and to reduce costs. The combination of&#13;
inservicing and onservicing was maintained, but the residential block courses were dropped,&#13;
and the program for the weekly meetings restructured to include subject content as well as&#13;
lesson planning and follow-up. Sanggar PKG training was carried out by guru inti (key&#13;
teachers). Originally the guru inti were simply teachers who had performed well in PKG&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
100                         Annex 11. Page 2 of 6&#13;
murni training, but starting in 1990, a special training program was set up for them (Latihan&#13;
Kerja Guru Inti: LKGI). In the long-established subjects (science, mathematics, English)&#13;
LKGI training replaced the original PKG mumi program, which was discontinued at this&#13;
time. The instructors thus became trainers of trainers rather than trainers of teachers.&#13;
MGMP Training. In 1993 Sanggar PKG was in turn replaced by a new program,&#13;
Musyawara Guru Mata Pelajaran (MGMP), which continues to the present. Training content&#13;
remains much the same, but intensity is further reduced. Teachers' meetings take place on&#13;
average once every three weeks, and onservice visits have been dropped altogether. The two-&#13;
week training programs for guru inti (LKGI) have been curtailed to two days only.&#13;
PKG Model C Training. The kabupaten-based Sanggar PKG program, and the&#13;
successor MGMP program, extended training activities to teachers in the more-accessible&#13;
rural schools, but were not able to reach teachers in the most isolated schools. PKG Model C&#13;
was initiated in 1993 to meet the needs of these teachers. The program is run at the&#13;
provincial level, by instructors rather than guru inti. Participants attend two block inservice&#13;
courses of two weeks each, and receive a single onservice visit. There are no weekly&#13;
meetings.&#13;
Evaluation Studies&#13;
The 1984 UNDPIUNESCO PKG Science Evaluation. This was a full-scale&#13;
evaluation of a PKG program, involving classroom observation and pupil assessment. based&#13;
on observations of lessons taught by more than 500 teachers, and the assessment of the&#13;
performance of a similar number of student groups in science experiments, the evaluators&#13;
concluded that PKG science had produced an impressive impact, both on the teaching&#13;
behavior of teachers and on the learning behavior of pupils. PKG-trained teachers asked&#13;
more questions - particularly high intellectual demand questions - and a higher proportion of&#13;
their questions were answered by the pupils. In the science experiments, pupil groups whose&#13;
teachers had had a high level of exposure to PKG scored, in some cases, more than two&#13;
standard deviations better than groups whose teachers had had no PKG exposure.&#13;
The review carried out for project preparation was done over a limited time period:&#13;
one week in Jakarta, followed by two weeks fieldwork in the provinces using the flexible&#13;
method of rapid policy appraisal.&#13;
The review covered three provinces, selected from among those to be included in the&#13;
proposed Secondary Education Projects: D.I. Aceh, Jawa Timur, and Kalimantan Barat. In&#13;
each province, three schools were visited: first, a school in or near the kabupaten capital,&#13;
selected by the PKG team as a model of good practice; second, a school in a moderately&#13;
accessible rural area; and third, a school in a remote area, if possible, one participating in the&#13;
Model C program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 11: Page 3 of 6                        101&#13;
Findings&#13;
The results of the review can be summarized in three main findings:&#13;
(a)    The programs have succeeded in developing an extensive group of secondary&#13;
school teachers into teacher trainers, widely distributed throughout the&#13;
Republic at both the provincial and the kabupaten level (instructors and guru&#13;
inti, respectively). The quality of these trainers is variable, but the best of&#13;
them are highly impressive. They constitute an invaluable human resource&#13;
which should be fully utilized in future quality-improvement activities.&#13;
(b)    There was excellent teaching in a few schools, mainly located in or near&#13;
major city centers where exposure to PKG has been greatest. Elsewhere,&#13;
however, evidence of improved pedagogy in the classroom was not evident.&#13;
In most of the lessons, teachers focused on delivering subject content without&#13;
paying sufficient attention to what pupils were learning. Teachers asked few&#13;
questions, so that communication in the classroom was essentially one-way.&#13;
At the time of the 1984 UNESCO/UNDP evaluation, which reported so positively on&#13;
PKG's impact on teaching and learning, the program was still in its pilot phase. In the years&#13;
since then, PKG has faced all the difficulties which have beset the implementors of&#13;
innovative educational projects everywhere in the world, when they have attempted to move&#13;
from the pilot phase to a national program. The problems were of at least three major kinds:&#13;
(a)    Delivery problems. During the pilot phase of PKG, while the project was&#13;
limited in scope, the core group of trainers (the instructors) were able to work&#13;
directly with the end-users (the teachers). But as coverage widened, it was&#13;
necessary to introduce intermediate trainers (the guru inti), who transmitted&#13;
the messages from the core group to the end users. These intermediate&#13;
trainers were, inevitably, not as well prepared as the core group.  In&#13;
consequence, the flow of new ideas tended to become restricted - even, in&#13;
some cases, to dry up altogether.&#13;
(b)    Management problems. As a pilot project, PKG was run effectively by a&#13;
small team of innovators on the basis of enthusiasm, charisma, and personal&#13;
contacts. But as activities expanded, the lack of formal linkages to the routine&#13;
management system became a constraint on success.&#13;
(c)    Financial problems. On a per capita basis, the pilot program was generously&#13;
funded, but as the number of participants multiplied, financing became more&#13;
of a constraint.&#13;
Three other problems, not connected with the expanding scope of the program, have&#13;
also tended to restrict the effectiveness of PKG:&#13;
(a)    Course content. From a limited observation of MGMP and Model C training&#13;
courses, it seems that while a great deal of effort is put into activities which&#13;
strengthen the teacher, relatively little attention is paid to student learning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
102                   Annex I l--Page 4 of 6&#13;
Teachers analyze the curriculum, prepare lesson plans, and practice peer&#13;
teaching. But they do not routinely analyze samples of pupils' work, to&#13;
decide whether the approaches they had used had led to effective learning, or&#13;
to determine which concepts and skills the pupils found most difficult. The&#13;
construction of class tests does receive attention, but most of the tests are&#13;
mainly in multiple-choice format, and hence not suited for diagnostic and&#13;
remedial purposes.&#13;
(b)   Lack of follow-up. At the end of the training cycle, participants have no&#13;
further contact with the training team, unless they enter a subsequent cycle.&#13;
In consequence, incentives to maintain new teaching approaches are weak.&#13;
(c)    Examination backwash. Between 80% and 90% of questions in the Ebtanas&#13;
and other external examinations are in multiple-choice form.  A high&#13;
proportion of these questions test straightforward recall or (in mathematics&#13;
and science) routine calculation, only a small proportion test application,&#13;
problem solving and other higher-level skills. Such material is much easier&#13;
and quicker to teach using didactic rather than student-active methods. So the&#13;
examinations send powerful signals to the teacher as to the pedagogical&#13;
approaches she should adopt. Clearly, reform of the content of the Ebtanas&#13;
and other external examinations should be a high priority.&#13;
Policy Proposals&#13;
Program Content. The content of all inservicing activities would be revitalized; in&#13;
particular, future programs would pay much more attention to promoting student learning&#13;
than they do at present.  Emphasis would be given to the development of effective&#13;
questioning techniques, so that teachers become skilled in identifying students' learning&#13;
difficulties. They would learn to construct open-ended formative tests for use in the&#13;
classroom, and to use the results to improve learning.&#13;
Preparing the first draft of this new training program would be the responsibility of&#13;
the Development Team for the relevant subject. They would work in collaboration with&#13;
national consultants and international consultants.&#13;
The Development Teams and the consultants would also be responsible for devising&#13;
suitable tests for monitoring pupils' learning during the course of the project. The majority&#13;
of the test questions should test higher-order skills rather than simple recall, and should be in&#13;
open-ended format. Models from best current international practice would be used as a guide&#13;
in devising these tests.&#13;
National consultants would be drawn from Teacher Education Institutions (IKIPs and&#13;
FKIPs) and other appropriate institutions. They would have had recent and relevant&#13;
experience in the schools, involving the application of effective subject-specific pedagogical&#13;
methods.  International consultants would likewise be specialists in subject-specific&#13;
pedagogy, with recent and relevant school-based expedience. They would have a working&#13;
knowledge of Bahasa Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1I: Page 5 of 6                         103&#13;
During the first year, consultants and instructors would monitor the implementation&#13;
of the new programs. At the end of the year, the programs would be evaluated, and revised in&#13;
the light of implementation experience.&#13;
Program Delivery&#13;
It is proposed that in future, training would be delivered through two modes:&#13;
(a)    cluster-level programs for the more accessible schools; and&#13;
(b)    provincial-level programs for the isolated schools complemented by inter&#13;
school principals in the programs as trainers.&#13;
In both programs, a regular schedule of school visits would replace onservice training. The&#13;
purpose of these visits would be to provide professional guidance to teachers, but also to&#13;
monitor their performance. All teachers - not just those currently involved in inservice&#13;
activities - would be observed.&#13;
Cluster-level Programs for More Accessible Schools&#13;
In the more accessible areas, teacher development programs should be essentially&#13;
independent (mandiri) and self-financing (swadana) but would be eligible for Project and&#13;
support.&#13;
Management. The program will be managed by Ka Kandep or his representative,&#13;
working with a group of Kepalah Sekolah representing the participating schools. The&#13;
management team will divide the kabupaten into clusters of appropriate size, and be&#13;
responsible for finances, the maintenance of records, and arranging the trainers' work&#13;
schedules.&#13;
Meelings.  Cluster-level teachers' meetings will be held on a regular basis,&#13;
approximately 15 times per year. A cluster level management team consisting of the head&#13;
teachers of the participating schools will set the timetable, guru inti will be responsible for&#13;
arranging and running the program.&#13;
School visits. Guru inti will carry out systematic visits to all junior secondary&#13;
schools on a regular basis. During the visit, the guru inti will observe a lesson taught by&#13;
every teacher in his specialist subject, provide feedback, and write a report highlighting&#13;
achievements as well as identifying areas where there is need for improvement. A permanent&#13;
file of reports will be maintained.&#13;
Visits from the provincial team.  Subject specialist pengawas (supervisors) and&#13;
instructors will visit the kabupaten on a regular basis to guide and monitor the guru inti's&#13;
work. They will review the guru inti' school reports and visit cluster meetings.&#13;
Incentives for improvement will be introduced including the display of outstanding&#13;
students' work at the cluster center, the presentation of model lessons by outstanding teachers&#13;
at special cluster meetings, and opportunities for upgrading and promotion for guru inti.&#13;
&#13;

Provincial-level Programs for the Isolated Schools&#13;
Changes proposed for these programs are less radical than those proposed for the&#13;
more accessible schools, as the activities have been in progress for only a short period of&#13;
time, and the majority of teachers have not yet had the opportunity to participate. Several&#13;
innovations, however, are proposed.&#13;
Duration. The training program for each batch of teachers should run for one year.&#13;
There would be three inservice blocks instead of two, to ensure that subject content for the&#13;
full teaching year is covered.&#13;
School visits. Three visits should be made to participating schools each year where&#13;
this is feasible and cost effective. Instructors would visit schools in teams of two, one to&#13;
observe lessons in mathematics and science, the other, lessons in Bahasa Indonesia, English,&#13;
and geography. Instructors should observe lessons by all teachers in the school, rather than&#13;
just those currently engaged in the training program for schools in more difficult areas. Head&#13;
teachers of the schools would be given training as part of the in-service training network to&#13;
provide systematic pedagogical support to teachers in their schools.&#13;

PRIVATE JUNIOR SECONDARY EDUCATION&#13;
1.    Description of the Private Sector at Junior Secondary Level&#13;
The private sector has a large participation in the provision of edication services at the&#13;
junior secondary level. In 1994/95, the latest academic year for which statistical information is&#13;
available, enrollments in public and private schools in the four project provinces were as follows:&#13;

The important part played by the private sector in the supply of junior secondary education&#13;
services is not a recent phenomenon. Over the past 10 years, private school enrollments have&#13;
consistently been above 40% of the total for all of Indonesia, although there has been a gradual&#13;
reduction from about 46% in 1985/86. More specifically, the share of private school enrollments&#13;
declined until 1992/93 during a period of reductions in total enrollments from the previous peak of&#13;
7.4 million in 1988/89. But it has been kept constant at about 41 percent during the resurgence of&#13;
junior secondary school enrollments in the last two years.&#13;
With the exception of schools (Madrasahs, MTs) managed by local Islamic groups, whose&#13;
establishment is approved, and operation is supervised, by the Ministry of Religious Affairs&#13;
(MORA), private school establishment and operation is approved and supervised by the Ministry of&#13;
Education and Culture (MOEC). In 1994-95 there were 18,221 private schools in Indonesia, 10,674&#13;
of which were under the supervision of MOEC (SLTPs) and 7,547 Madrasahs (MTs). The number&#13;
of schools and of students in the project Provinces were as follows:&#13;

School Establishment and Accreditation Many private schools are established and operated&#13;
by local communities which have not succeeded in their efforts to have a public school established,&#13;
or by associations of teachers. In addition, a large number of private secondary schools in Indonesia&#13;
are established by various organizations, often of a religious character, which wish to influence&#13;
public opinion and social behavior in local communities. In addition to religious organizations,&#13;
such as the Mohammadiya and the Catholic Church, several large commercial enterprises, mostly in&#13;
the business of extracting and processing natural resources, also belong in this group. It should be&#13;
noted, however, that in the large majority of cases where schools are operated by organizations&#13;
aiming at influencing local communities, the specific location of the school is determined by&#13;
whether a public school already exists and, if so, whether such a school has the capacity to meet&#13;
existing local demand for education. It is rare to find cases of private schools in direct competition&#13;
with public schools.&#13;
An organization of the type described above, starts the process of establishing a new private&#13;
school by seeking a favorable ruling on the part of the MOEC and local Government officials at the&#13;
Sub-District level. The ruling is generally favorable if these officials perceive that there is a large&#13;
enough number of primary school graduates in the proposed catchment area with no access to a&#13;
public school to satisfy operation of a new school. Once their approval is secured, the sponsoring&#13;
group, through a non-profit association (yayasan) formed for this specific purpose, submits an&#13;
application to the District office of MOEC which eventually must be approved by the head of the&#13;
MOEC office at Province level (Kakanwil). Normally it takes about 9 months for the whole process&#13;
to be completed.&#13;
Schools are supervised and accredited by the MOEC Directorate of Private Schools, through&#13;
local MOEC officials at the Province and District levels. Accreditation classifies schools in one of&#13;
four categories: Listed (lowest), registered, recognized, and equivalent (highest).  A newly&#13;
established school is classified as listed, and a review for potential upgrading of its status takes place&#13;
three years later, when the school has produced its first graduates. There are 8 quality criteria&#13;
applied during review (such as student performance in national exams, number of graduates, and&#13;
adequacy of school facilities). Depending on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 12: Page 3 of 6                         107&#13;
results, the school may retain the "listed" status or be promoted to a higher category. In principle&#13;
(and also in a few actual cases), a school may be promoted immediately after the first review to the&#13;
highest "equivalent" category. But normally there is a more gradual progression following&#13;
successive reviews. The distribution by accreditation category and Province is given in Table 3.&#13;

Although the Directorate of Private Schools of MOEC does not collect information on the&#13;
association between school ownership and accreditation ranking, partial information from a small&#13;
number of Provinces included in the proposed projects indicates the following: "Equivalent"&#13;
schools are in general owned and operated by religious organizations and large enterprises&#13;
exploiting natural resources, while a few of them are operated by teachers' associations.&#13;
"Recognized" schools are in general owned and operated by teachers' associations and other non-&#13;
profit organizations (yayasans) while a few of them are owned by religious organizations.&#13;
"Registered" schools are generally owned and operated by teachers' associations and other non-&#13;
profit organizations, while a large number also belong to small town and village communities.&#13;
Finally, "listed" schools are in general owned and operated by small rural communities that do not&#13;
have a public school in the community itself or at a nearby location.&#13;
2.    Description of Public Support Program for Private Schools&#13;
The Government is clearly aware of the benefits of a flourishing private sector in junior&#13;
secondary education. Its policy orientations are explicitly stated in Repelita VI (Book IV, pp. 98-99&#13;
and 112-115 and accompanying Tables) indicating the Government's determination that private&#13;
schools should preserve and even increase their share in total junior secondary enrollments. More&#13;
important from a practical point of view, the public sector devotes significant amounts of resources,&#13;
in kind as well as in the form of money grants, to support and improve the quality of private schools.&#13;
Support in kind includes secondment of public sector teachers to private schools, distribution of&#13;
approved textbooks free of charge, provision of equipment, and training of private school teachers in&#13;
publicly funded programs. Money grants are provided to about two thirds of private schools at the&#13;
lower end of financial viability (i.e., "listed", "registered" and part of "recognized" schools).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
108&#13;
Annex 12: Page 4 of 6&#13;
Teachers. For all of Indonesia seconded teachers fill 16.2% of teaching posts in private&#13;
schools, while for the 11 Provinces included in the three proposed projects this percentage varies&#13;
from 35.7% in Yogyakarta to 8.7% in East Java (1993/94 figures).&#13;
Textbooks. For private schools, estimated needs amount to 30.86 million textbooks for&#13;
students and 1.06 million teacher guides. Actual distribution during 1993/94 - 1995/96 amounted to&#13;
15.48 million textbooks for students and 0.30 million teacher guides. Thus, although large gaps still&#13;
remain, public sector contributions are very important in supplying this critical input for raising&#13;
school quality.&#13;
Teacher Training and Equipment. No tabulated information exists on the magnitude of&#13;
public sector funding for training private school teachers and supplying teaching equipment to&#13;
private schools. Officials in charge of these activities at MOEC estimate that the public sector&#13;
allocates about 20 percent of its training activities to private teachers, and distributes also about 20%&#13;
of purchased school equipment to private schools.&#13;
Operational Cost Subsidies. Public sector subsidization of the operational cost of private&#13;
schools is granted to both SLTP and Madrasah schools and is in the form of a flat amount per&#13;
classroom (uniform for all Provinces and subsidized schools). Although data on the total number of&#13;
private schools' classrooms are not available for 1995/96 and 1996/97, their numbers for 1993/94&#13;
and 1994/95 indicate that the operational cost support program covers between 50% and 55% of&#13;
SLTP classrooms, and between 90% and 95% of Madrasah classrooms, for a combined total of&#13;
about 65% of all private school classrooms. The program targets schools at the lower end of&#13;
financing capacity.&#13;
The overall level of public sector support to private schools is estimated at about US$58&#13;
million, or 9% of total public spending (development and recurrent) on junior secondary education.&#13;
Salaries of seconded teachers make up about two thirds of the total cost, textbooks and teachers&#13;
guides 17%, operational cost subsidies 12%, while teacher training and distribution of equipment&#13;
are less important cost items.&#13;
3.    Description of Project Support for Private Schools&#13;
The project's financing for such areas that are smaller parts of the Government's support&#13;
program -- including teacher training and the provision of instructional tools -- would therefore&#13;
complement the GOI's own efforts. By raising the standard of instruction at private schools, project&#13;
funding for quality inputs would help reduce the disparity between public and private education and&#13;
encourage parents to view private schooling as a worthwhile option. By stimulating demand for&#13;
private schooling in this way, the Government would limit the amount of public expenditure&#13;
required to achieve its enrollment targets.&#13;
' For 1994/95, information not yet tabulated indicates that the total number of seconded teachers&#13;
increased by about 600, while for 1995/96 the number is stabilized at 1994/95 levels.&#13;

CRITERIA FOR ASSISTANCE TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS&#13;
1. Support for quality improvement to private schools will be in the form of reference and&#13;
library books, equipment, teacher training, and management and teacher upgrading programs.&#13;
2. Assistance in the form of in-kind educational inputs is preferable to grant for the following&#13;
reasons:&#13;
*  the above inputs in-kind can lead directly to the quality improvement sought, and to&#13;
the upgrading of the accreditation of the schools;&#13;
*  outputs or outcomes of assistance are more tangible;&#13;
*  assistance is easily monitored, such as number of teachers trained, books delivered,&#13;
equipment supplied, etc.;&#13;
*  distribution of assistance is more efficient;&#13;
* possible abuse of government assistance will be minimized.&#13;
3. Priority will be given to rural, remote, or poor private schools which have the potential to&#13;
increase enrollment and quality, especially self-help community private schools. Among&#13;
those schools, priority will be given to viable private schools not receiving any other&#13;
assistance from government.&#13;
4. Assistance will be awarded annually, and maintained if the school satisfies the above criteria.&#13;
5. Eligible private schools can apply for the government assistance to the Head of MOEC&#13;
District Office (Kakandep). Private schools can also apply to the Head of MOEC Provincial&#13;
Office (Kakanwil).&#13;
6. Selection, review and decision processes will be undertaken by the Private School Assistance&#13;
Committee at Kanwil Office.&#13;
7. Recipient school will receive assistance annually, and can be extended upon satisfactory&#13;
performance.&#13;
8. The effectiveness of the private school assistance program would be monitored annually&#13;
using basic educational indicators in a structured format.&#13;

INDONESIA&#13;
Central Indonesia Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Institutional Background&#13;
The origins of project design and the proposed management arrangements for this&#13;
project are rooted in lessons of experience from earlier projects, especially the Second&#13;
Secondary Education and Management Project (Loan 3158-IND). The design elements in the&#13;
proposed Central Indonesia Project are therefore a logical sequel to earlier tested and improved&#13;
project design elements. What worked in the earlier project is being refined and incorporated in&#13;
the proposed project. Other elements are being revised. The major design difference between&#13;
this and the earlier project is however in the proposed project management arrangements.&#13;
Beneficiary participation is a major project design feature. The center of gravity of project&#13;
implementation for the proposed project will be in the province, and provincial differences are&#13;
explicitly acknowledged in project design elements.&#13;
The sectoral analysis and preparation for this project took place amidst important&#13;
institutional changes that date back about three years. The emphasis has been on: (a)&#13;
strengthening the participatory features of the project (such as the involvement of the lower&#13;
tiers of the administration, schools and communities) in decision making that immediately&#13;
affects them; (b) strengthening province-level implementation with respect to province-specific&#13;
sector analysis, project design and implementation; and (c) strengthening the national-level&#13;
implementation capacity as a coordinator, education policy analyst, problem solver and provider&#13;
of technical assistance to the provinces.&#13;
Participatory Features&#13;
Because of implementation difficulties in the Second Secondary Education and&#13;
Management Project (Loan 31 58-IND), parts of that project have since 1994 been used to pilot-&#13;
test new implementation approaches in five provinces (including two of the provinced/ that are&#13;
supported under the Central Indonesia Junior Secondary Education Project). Beneficiary&#13;
participation has been a major element of the new approach.&#13;
A milestone was reached in this respect in December 1994 when the Directorate of&#13;
Secondary Education (Dikmenum) with Bank assistance conducted a two-day seminar with&#13;
stakeholders from the five pilot provinces as well as six other provinces that were proposed for&#13;
follow-on operations at that time. The seminar helped: (a) clearly define the objectives of the&#13;
proposed pilot project and its successor; (b) review options for project management structures,&#13;
responsibilities and implementation procedures; and build consensus provinces on&#13;
implementation of the above. The primary audience was staff at various levels of provincial&#13;
governments that were the most likely to be involved in project preparation and implementation&#13;
I/ Central Kalimantan and Yogyakarta. The other three pilot project provinces are South Sulawesi, NTB and West Java.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
112                            Annex 13: Page 2 of 6&#13;
of the first few junior secondary education projects. About 120 staff attended and were actively&#13;
involved in workshop activities.&#13;
Sectoral analysis and project development under the currently proposed project have&#13;
built on experiences from this workshop. Several workshops on sectoral issues, project design&#13;
and institutional framework have subsequently been conducted at different times and locations.&#13;
The result is a series of provincially organized project proposals that have been developed with&#13;
major involvement from the stakeholders: province and district-level education officers&#13;
(Kanwils and Kandeps), parent organizations (BP3), schools and educational societies&#13;
(Yayasan). See Attachment 1.&#13;
Beneficiary participation will continue throughout project implementation.&#13;
Communities will participate in project development through regular meetings at the sub-&#13;
district level attended by members of BP3, school principals, village chiefs, religious leaders,&#13;
and community social-service workers. These meetings will propose and evaluate possible&#13;
project activities appropriate to local conditions and consistent with local needs. Sub-district&#13;
proposals would be submitted through the Kandep to the Provincial Project Implementation&#13;
Unit (PPIU) for its review against agreed criteria and possible inclusion in the project.&#13;
A key concept of the proposed project is, that detailed annual work programs would be&#13;
prepared each year. The costs and details of the outer implementation years have been&#13;
tentatively estimated, but these cost estimates will not be considered firm until an annual&#13;
budgeting and evaluation process has taken place each implementation year. The process of&#13;
preparation and implementation of Annual Work Plans and Budgets will therefore be a central&#13;
feature of the proposed project. This process is entirely consistent with existing Government&#13;
budget planning procedures, but under the proposed project the involvement of project&#13;
beneficiaries in this process would be explicitly strengthened. Sub-district proposals would be&#13;
submitted at specified times annually to the Provincial Project Implementation Unit (PPIU) in&#13;
each province for its review, culling, or possibly further development in accordance with agreed&#13;
criteria and procedures.&#13;
The selection of good alternatives would thus help guide the development of the project&#13;
as it unfolds. For example, committee members could elect to apply for using project funds to a&#13;
cluster of villages for the purpose of establishing boarding facilities at a given location.&#13;
During such submissions, project implementors at the Kanwil level vould be informed&#13;
about actions that the communities would be prepared to carry out in return for project-supplied&#13;
benefits. For example, in return for receiving funds for establishing boarding facilities, there&#13;
could be an undertaking by a cluster of villages to organize themselves to maintain a sustainable&#13;
boarding system in one village for the cluster.&#13;
Province-level Implementation&#13;
Provincial Structure Provincial involvement in sectoral analysis and project design&#13;
has shown that there is a growing capacity to implement the proposed project. During the&#13;
preparation process, Kanwil staff have conducted sectoral analyses, commissioned project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 13: Page 3 of 6                       113&#13;
preparation reports from lower administrative tiers, and appraised and revised these reports for&#13;
discussions with Bank missions. The continuing challenge is to identify potential strengths and&#13;
weaknesses for project implementation.&#13;
Because of the above strengths and the rapidly developing human capabilities in the&#13;
provinces, the project would be implemented through existing line authorities at the Kanwil&#13;
level. There would be no expansion of staff positions: existing positions would be used, and/or&#13;
converted temporarily for project use as and when necessary. Similarly, there would be no&#13;
structural changes in the administrative system. Project-specific task forces, commensurate&#13;
with the focus and specificity of each of the four provincial sub-projects would be established as&#13;
necessary. Each of these task forces would be composed of existing staff at the Kanwil-level,&#13;
and -- where appropriate -- at the Kandep level. These task forces would grow and contract as&#13;
necessary during project implementation. Judging from discussions in the provinces it has&#13;
become clear that the above concept is not only viable: it embodies the ongoing concept of&#13;
empowering and engaging existing provincial staff in sectoral analysis and project preparation.&#13;
Large numbers of Kanwil and Kandep staff have participated in the project design process and&#13;
have actively developed and honed their project design skills since late 1994.&#13;
To lend a focal point to the proposed implementation arrangements, a PPIU under the&#13;
overall leadership of Kakanwil, would be established in each Province. A senior staff (such as&#13;
the head of secondary education -- Kabid-Dikmenum -- or someone under his/her supervision)&#13;
would function as the Project Manager. He/she would be responsible for the day-to-day&#13;
management of the project and would report to Kakanwil on all matters pertaining to the&#13;
project. He/she would also keep the project authorities in Jakarta (Dikmenum) informed about&#13;
progress, including any events that threatened progress, such as the lack of human or financial&#13;
resources to resolve emerging problems.&#13;
A Provincial Project Advisory Committee in each province would provide overall&#13;
implementation guidance to the PPIU. The advisory committee would meet at least twice a&#13;
year, or whenever major project decisions must be made. It would be chaired by KaKanwil and&#13;
have membership from the senior-most tiers of the public and private education system in each&#13;
province plus representatives of other government agencies. The advisory committees would vet&#13;
and compare proposals from sub-districts. The advisory committee in each province would also&#13;
draw on information and ideas submitted to it from the lower tiers of the administrative system&#13;
(Kabupaten and Kecamatan).&#13;
A technical resource group in each province would assist in technical analysis of&#13;
sectoral issues, detailed project design, troubleshooting on an ad-hoc basis, and staff&#13;
training/guidance. It would include consultants as needed, plus access to provincial staff&#13;
(including IKIPs/Universities) with specialized project-related skills. It would also be able to&#13;
call on technical expertise from Dikmenum in Jakarta whenever necessary.&#13;
In terms of routine project implementation, there would typically be the following five&#13;
implementation divisions, carrying out the annually agreed tasks and reporting to the Manager&#13;
of the PPIU:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
114                           Annex 13. Page 4 of 6&#13;
*  Civil Works and Procurement This team would be headed by the existing procurement&#13;
officer in each Kanwil. He/she would cany out the agreed procurement actions each year in&#13;
close cooperation with the executing engineer in Public Works (school construction). This&#13;
team would also liaise with the national procurement team to ensure the technical quality of&#13;
procurement.&#13;
*  Quality Improvement. This team would typically be headed by the training officer in each&#13;
province, but would also draw on other educational staff resources, such as examinations&#13;
staff.&#13;
*  Accounting. The head of the financing section of the Kanwil office would be responsible&#13;
for maintaining project accounts in an agreed format.&#13;
*  Progress Monitoring. This team would monitor progress on all project aspects, especially&#13;
the process indicators and the agreed outcome indicators.&#13;
*  Supervision and Evaluation. This would be a trouble-shooting team, destined to work on&#13;
project related issues as they emerge, and to evaluate the significance of outcomes as they&#13;
become evident.&#13;
Review and Criteria for Annual Project Activities. The PPIU would review the&#13;
annually submitted proposals and project ideas against several explicit and well-advertised&#13;
criteria. On completion of its review in October each year, the PPIU would: (a) discuss the&#13;
technical merits and scope of the proposals with a Bank mission; and (b) submit the results and&#13;
the proposed budget for the ensuing year to the Provincial Project Advisory Committee for its&#13;
review. The committee in turn would submit the proposal for the endorsement of the National&#13;
Education Authorities in Jakarta before submission as a budget proposal to Bappenas.  The&#13;
purpose of the endorsement of the National Education Authorities would be to ensure that the&#13;
provincial submission is in accordance with agreed Government and Bank policies, criteria,&#13;
procedures and project magnitudes. Selection criteria would include: (i) completeness; (ii)&#13;
relevance; (iii) cost-effectiveness; (iv)sustainability; and (v) implementability.&#13;
Completeness. Proposals and/or project ideas would be reviewed to test whether the&#13;
ideas were sufficiently developed to constitute a viable activity with clearly defined objectives,&#13;
inputs, costs, timetables and action plans. Technical assistance from the technical resource&#13;
group would be employed to further develop promising ideas into full-fledged proposals.&#13;
Relevance. The relevance of the submitted proposals or project ideas would be tested&#13;
against any of the stated objectives of the project, taking into account known implementation&#13;
constraints. Proposals that failed to meet this test would be rejected. The following questions&#13;
would be asked: (i) is this proposal a high-priority item in terms of poverty alleviation? (ii) are&#13;
the complementary resources in place that make this item viable (such as a trained and&#13;
motivated science teacher when asking for science equipment); (iii) is the proposed usage of&#13;
this item high enough (say 75% of the school time-table); or (iv) are there specific usage plans&#13;
in place (e.g. in the case of administrative blocks -- would it improve teacher performance? --&#13;
would it be used e.g. to house library collections etc.) that justify this investment? why would&#13;
an administrative block be a higher priority than a standard classroom? etc.).&#13;
Cost-effectiveness.  The cost-effectiveness merits of submitted proposals would be&#13;
tested against alternatives for delivering comparable educational service.  The following&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 13: Page 5 of 6                       115&#13;
questions would be asked: (i) are there alternative ways of delivering this service?; (ii) if the&#13;
answer to (i) is yes, are there less costly alternatives? and if the answer to (ii) is yes, the question&#13;
of the relative effectiveness of the different approaches would have to be asked. This test would&#13;
be of particular relevance to the comparisons of proposals for boarding vs transportation of&#13;
teachers between schools). Proposals that combined relative effectiveness with modest costs&#13;
would prevail over less cost-effective alternatives.&#13;
Sustainability. The long-term sustainability of the proposals would be tested against&#13;
their implications for recurrent costs in the Government's budget, and their likely implications&#13;
for long-term effects on households in the affected communities.&#13;
Implementability.   The question of whether the submitted proposal could be&#13;
implemented, given possible institutional, managerial and other non-financial constraints,&#13;
would be an important evaluation criterion.&#13;
National-level Implementation&#13;
The National implementation agencies would have a dual role. First, they would be&#13;
responsible for monitoring overall progress, and ensuring that project implementation (as it&#13;
unfolds through the Annual Workplan and Budget process) is in accordance with project&#13;
objectives and agreed project criteria and rules. Second, they would guide the provinces and&#13;
provide (or locate the sources of) the necessary technical assistance to ensure that the project&#13;
implements as planned.&#13;
Dikmenum would be the principal national level project coordinating agency.&#13;
Distinctly different from the roles of the provincial (Kanwil) offices, its role would be that of&#13;
project oversight and facilitation -- not implementation. Dikmenum would: (a) ensure that&#13;
provincial implementation focuses on achieving agreed project objectives; (b) assist the&#13;
provinces in establishing appropriate annual work plans; (c) help ensure timely preparation of&#13;
regional project budgets (DIP); (d) assist in establishing appropriate management information&#13;
systems (both financial and substantive) for use at the Kanwil level as well as at the National&#13;
level; (e) disseminate information to the provinces in order to highlight promising regional&#13;
approaches in sub-project selection and design; and (f) identify or provide technical assistance&#13;
to the provinces to ensure compliance with agreed project-specific rules and regulations.&#13;
Dikmenum would help design and implement national and provincial capacitybuilding&#13;
plans as the project unfolds. This would include assisting the provinces establish appropriate&#13;
project information systems and procedures on the principle that relevant information from one&#13;
system would feed into the next system, and that there would be meaningful back and forth flow&#13;
of information across administrative levels. These information and support systems would&#13;
include: (i) budgeting systems; (ii) accounting (keeping track of the sources and application of&#13;
funds); (iii) procurement (keep track of progress and provide assistance in documentation); (iv)&#13;
process indicators (keeping track of implementation progress and in providing project resources&#13;
to its beneficiaries); and (v) project outcome indicators (keeping track of whether project&#13;
resources are having an effect on its beneficiaries). This is further discussed below:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
116                        Annex 13. Page 6 of 6&#13;
*  Budgeting Systems (including Special Accounts). The project includes four provinces and&#13;
major implementation activities at the Kandep level (construction). All project budgets (the&#13;
DIP -- Government and Bank) would be channeled annually to the provinces in accordance&#13;
with normal Government investment budgeting procedures. The provinces would arrange&#13;
payments to contractors through standard government procedures. The Special Account&#13;
would be located in the Bank of Indonesia. Payments would be authorized by provincial&#13;
Treasury offices of the MOF in accordance with existing well-established procedures.&#13;
*  Project accounts would be established in such a way that meaningful information about&#13;
unit costs of project activities could be obtained as the project progresses. The currently&#13;
used standardized format under Loan 3158 would be revised and used under the proposed&#13;
project to record agreed expenditure categories (e.g. from COSTAB). The financial&#13;
recording would include the following monitoring devices in a descending order of&#13;
accuracy: (i) the original indicative plans (from COSTAB at preparation/appraisal); (ii) the&#13;
annual work plans as they develop each year; (iii) agreed annual budgets; (iv) actual&#13;
commitments (by year); (v) actual expenditures (by year); and (vi) actual disbursements&#13;
from the proposed Loan.&#13;
To assist in the above revisions of the accounting systems, an Indonesian accounting&#13;
firm would be hired for a period of about three months. This firm would review and revise the&#13;
financial information system at both the provincial and national levels and train education staff&#13;
in its use. Special attention would be paid to ensure that the specific financial information needs&#13;
of each administrative level would be well served. The accounting systems would become a&#13;
part of the overall project management and information system of the project.&#13;
*   Procurement Documents and Procedures. The Central Program Coordination Unit in&#13;
Dikmenum would have an important role to play in establishing appropriate procurement&#13;
documents and procedures under the proposed project and in providing appropriate&#13;
technical assistance in this respect to the provinces. Such documents and procedures for the&#13;
procurement of equipment have been developed under the "Pilot" part of the Second&#13;
Secondary Education and Management Project (Loan 31 58-IND). These documents will be&#13;
further adapted, developed and applied to the proposed project as it comes on stream.&#13;
*   Process Indicators An Implementation Monitoring System would in part be fed by&#13;
information from the accounting system. It would also include information about non-&#13;
financial progress in the project, such as deliveries of educational materials and numbers of&#13;
teachers trained.&#13;
*  Project Outcome Indicators. The outcomes of the proposed project would be monitored&#13;
throughout its implementation through three key indicators, each of which would be&#13;
disaggregated by gender and poverty-level. In addition to the above education indicators,&#13;
the efficiency of various parts of the system would be measured through ongoing&#13;
econometric studies.&#13;

that project implementation will be consistent with project objectives and Government policy.&#13;
The Committee will provide overall implementation guidance to the PPIU.&#13;

Terms of Reference&#13;
Central Program Coordination Unit&#13;
Objectives. The Central Program Coordination Unit (CPCU) will have three&#13;
objectives: (a) it will monitor overall progress, and ensure that project implementation (as it&#13;
unfolds through the Annual Work Plan and Budget process) is in accordance with project&#13;
objectives and agreed project criteria, rules and guidelines; (b) it will guide the provinces and&#13;
provide (or locate the sources of) the necessary technical assistance to ensure that the project&#13;
implements as planned; and (c) it will carry out central program activities that may affect more&#13;
than one project.&#13;
Composition Existing staff in Dikmenum, augmented as necessary by project-financed&#13;
consultants will be at the core of the management team.&#13;
Tasks, Roles and Responsibilities. The Director of Dikmenum will head the Central&#13;
Program Coordination Unit and coordinate the overall program of expanding junior secondary&#13;
education. An important function of the Central Program Coordination Unit will be to monitor&#13;
implementation achievements in the different provinces through progress reports and&#13;
monitoring indicators and to keep the Government and the Bank informed in this respect.&#13;
Dikmenum's role as the national level program coordination unit will be distinciy&#13;
different from the roles of the provincial (Kanwil) offices. As a program coordinator, its role&#13;
will be that of oversight and facilitation -- not implementation. Dikmenum will therefore: (a)&#13;
ensure that provincial implementation focuses on achieving their agreed project objectives as&#13;
measured through the agreed project-specific monitoring indicators; (b) assist the provinces in&#13;
establishing appropriate annual work plans and monitor that these are carried out in accordance&#13;
with agreed priorities, criteria and procedures; (c) help ensure timely preparation of regional&#13;
project budgets (DIP); (d) assist in establishing appropriate management information systems&#13;
(both financial and substantive) for use at the Kanwil level as well as at the National level; (e)&#13;
disseminate information to the provinces in order to highlight promising regional approaches in&#13;
the design of Annual Work Plans and Budgets; and (f) identify or provide technical assistance&#13;
to the provinces to ensure compliance with agreed project-specific criteria, rules and&#13;
regulations.&#13;
Linkages to the Provincial Teams. Dikmenum will also help design and implement&#13;
national and provincial capacity building plans as the project unfolds. This will include&#13;
assisting the provinces establish appropriate project information systems and procedures on the&#13;
principle that relevant information from one system will feed into the next system, and that&#13;
there will be meaningful back and forth flow of information across administrative levels.&#13;
Supervisory Functions. Dikmenum will have a procurement supervisory function to&#13;
help ensure that the project is implemented in accordance with the stipulations of the Loan&#13;
Agreement and the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. The CPCU will appoint procurement&#13;
specialists to provide training and technical assistance to PPIUs in the preparation of&#13;
procurement documents and to review documents from the provinces to ensure that they are in&#13;
line with project procurement guidelines.&#13;

Provincial Project Implementation Unit&#13;
Objectives. In order to get the project effectively implemented, the projects will be&#13;
executed through existing line authorities at the Kanwil level. There will be no expansion of&#13;
staff positions: existing positions will be used, and/or converted temporarily for project use as&#13;
and when necessary. Similarly, there will be no structural changes in the administrative system.&#13;
Team, Organization and Responsibilities. Project-specific task forces, commensurate&#13;
with the focus and specificity of each of the provincial projects will be established as necessary.&#13;
Each of these task forces will be composed of existing staff at the Kanwil-level, and -- where&#13;
appropriate -- at the Kandep level. These task forces will grow and contract as necessary during&#13;
project implementation.&#13;
KaKanwil in each Province will be responsible for project implementation. To lend a&#13;
focal point to the proposed implementation arrangements, a Provincial Project Implementation&#13;
Unit (PPIU) under the overall leadership of KaKanwil, will be established in each Province.&#13;
This PPIU, managed by the head of the secondary education group (Kabid-Dikmenum) or a&#13;
Dikmenum staff member working under his/her supervision, will form the core of the proposed&#13;
implementation arrangement. The manager of the PPIU will be responsible for the day-to-day&#13;
management of the project and will report to KaKanwil on all matters pertaining to the project.&#13;
He/she will also keep the project authorities in Jakarta (Dikmenum) informed about progress,&#13;
including any events that threatened progress, such as the lack of human or financial resources&#13;
to resolve emerging problems. If necessary, one full-time monitoring officer and one or two&#13;
support staff will assist the manager of the PPIU in keeping track of implementation progress.&#13;
The PPIU will be assisted by a technical resource group in each province for the&#13;
duration of the project. The duties of this group, including that of consultants, will be to assist&#13;
in technical analysis of sector issues, prepare annual plans and detailed project designs,&#13;
troubleshoot on an ad-hoc basis, and conduct staff training/guidance. The technical resource&#13;
group will have access to other staff resources (including those from IKIPs/Universities) with&#13;
specialized project-related skills.&#13;
Tasks. Under the PPIU, there will typically be the following five divisions to carry out&#13;
the following functions: (a) Procurement and Civil Works; (b) Quality Improvement;&#13;
(c) Accounting; (d) Progress Monitoring; and (e) Supervision and Evaluation.&#13;
Relationship with the CPCU. Each Provincial Project Implementation Unit will work&#13;
in close liaison with the Central Program Coordination Unit in Jakarta. All official project&#13;
correspondence with the Bank will be channeled through DGPSE, except as specifically&#13;
delegated by the Director-General.&#13;
Advisory Committee. A Provincial Project Advisory Committee (see separate terms of&#13;
reference) will provide overall implementation guidance to the PPIU.&#13;

Central Indonesia Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
PROJECT MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
Introduction&#13;
This plan describes how project progress will be monitored and impact will be&#13;
evaluated. Reporting on monitoring and evaluation results will be done within the context of&#13;
Bank progress reporting. In this Annex, the details of this reporting process will be&#13;
described.&#13;
Bank Reporting&#13;
Project progress reporting to the Bank will be on a semi-annual cycle. These half&#13;
yearly progress reports will cover project status (physical progress, financial and performance&#13;
status) and will include the status of the performance indicators. The progress report will be&#13;
prepared one month in advance of the half-yearly supervision missions from the Bank.&#13;
(a) Format of Progress Report&#13;
The half-yearly progress report should include the following sections:&#13;
*  A narrative section describing progress of each of the components, issues that&#13;
have arisen, problems, delays, suggested changes, and decisions that were made&#13;
during the last six months.&#13;
*  An updated list of the performance indicators, giving the latest information&#13;
available for each.&#13;
*  A section listing the recommendations and agreements made during the last Bank&#13;
supervision mission and actions or present position, six months later.&#13;
*  A list of all contract activities expected during the next year.&#13;
*  A set of tables covering the following:&#13;
Expenditures to date, by category of expense and by component;&#13;
Status of training activities, listing number and type of training courses,&#13;
number of participants, duration of each course, cost of each course;&#13;
Status of technical assistance contracts: number of person-months planned&#13;
and currently used, cost of contracts and disbursements;&#13;
Status of civil works: number of contracts, location, type of school covered&#13;
and cost for each contract.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 14: Page 2 of 2                      129&#13;
* An update of the project implementation schedule to show actual status of&#13;
milestones and tasks, against the original plan. At each supervision, these will be&#13;
reviewed, their status evaluated, and the plan updated to reflect progress. An&#13;
updated version of the implementation schedule will then be produced, showing&#13;
actual, planned, and adjustments.&#13;
(b) Performance Indicators&#13;
The performance and process indicator tables (Annex 15) lists the outcome and&#13;
output indicators that will be monitored during the project. Most of the indicators&#13;
listed will be collected and maintained in each of project Kanwil offices, with input&#13;
from the Kandep offices. The information management component of the project will&#13;
assist Kanwils and Kandeps in the effective management of this information.&#13;
(c) Supervision Schedule&#13;
Supervision missions will be held twice a year, during the project implementation&#13;
period. A planned mission schedule is listed in Annex 16. The mid-term review&#13;
mission will carry out a more thorough review; this mission will review overall&#13;
progress since the beginning of the implementation period, and will evaluate the need&#13;
for adjustments or restructuring of the project for the remainder of the project period.&#13;
Additional Reports and Reviews&#13;
A few special reviews will also be carried out during project implementation, to&#13;
further support monitoring of progress. These reviews will be carried out by&#13;
independent external consultants and will be managed by the Program Coordination&#13;
Unit in Dikmenum.&#13;
*  Survey, in preparation for mid-term, to evaluated progress in improving&#13;
management skills and processes in Kanwils and Kandeps;&#13;
* Annually, a review of expenditures of government funds by private schools;&#13;
*  Annually, monitoring of the effectiveness of the scholarship fund selection and&#13;
distribution;&#13;
*  At mid-term, a review of the effectiveness of the contract teachers program.&#13;

DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR TECHNICAL AUDIT&#13;
Objectives&#13;
1.    To ensure the accountability to the Government, the World Bank, the participant&#13;
communities and all stakeholders involved, a Technical Audit of the various project&#13;
components would be conducted annually. The goal of the technical audits would be to&#13;
provide impartial assessment of quality and efficiency of the methods and procedures&#13;
employed by Provincial Project Implementation Units (PPIUs) in the provinces and the&#13;
Central Program Coordination Unit (CPCU) at central MOEC in the implementation of the&#13;
project and the impact of this at school and administrative levels.&#13;
Team Composition, Qualification and Leadership&#13;
2.    Independence and Expertise.  The technical audit would be carried out by&#13;
independent consultants with no association with the project and with qualifications and&#13;
experience in: (a) the operations and management of junior secondary schools, including&#13;
open junior secondary schools; (b) teacher training strategies and assessment; (c) use of&#13;
library books and other educational resources; (d) use of other instructional materials; (e)&#13;
student examinations and performance assessment strategies, techniques and dissemination;&#13;
(f) location and adequacy of school construction; (g) selection and management of&#13;
scholarship program; (h) science education at junior secondary level; (i) development of&#13;
social marketing instruments; and (j) provincial, district, and school management practices.&#13;
3.    Qualification of Team Members. The Technical Audit Team (TAT) members must&#13;
have the academic qualification and demonstrated expertise in one or more of the areas&#13;
identified above (para. 2). To this end, they would be required to submit: (a) a signed&#13;
curriculum vitae, and a copy of major diplomas; (b) a letter of acceptance to act as member&#13;
of the TAT; and evidence of no commitment to other job during the period of the contract.&#13;
4.    Team Leadership. Even though characterized by an interdisciplinary approach the&#13;
Technical Audit Team would be required to have a leader to coordinate the operation, its&#13;
efficiency and quality of the final products.&#13;
Scope and Procedures&#13;
5.    The overall purpose of the technical audit is to identify those processes and outcomes&#13;
which are not easily captured by the annual missions or financial audits (which they are not&#13;
supposed to replace). The following activities can be mentioned as typical examples of the&#13;
concerns addressed by TAT: the educational interaction at classroom level and the best&#13;
utilization of teacher's time; what and how students are learning in classroom; how&#13;
educational resource materials are being used in everyday school life as a complement to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
134                            Annex 17: Page 2 of 3&#13;
classroom activities; the development of the science education study in the selected. Their&#13;
evaluation would be guided by the project's performance indicators.&#13;
Description of Tasks&#13;
6.     Regular and Open SMPs. The team would assess how effectively the different sizes&#13;
of regular SMPs operate in both the rural and urban areas, especially with reference to the&#13;
types of physical facilities and teachers provided to the schools. A detailed study of the open&#13;
SMPs would also be made to assess their effectiveness in providing junior secondary&#13;
education, and to identify the most appropriate ways of providing this type of education in a&#13;
cost-effective manner.&#13;
7.     Teacher Training Strategies and Assessment. The team needs to assess how PKG&#13;
training has changed to incorporate lessons recently learned and new strategies developed to&#13;
ensure that delivery strategies are modified appropriately to fit variety of conditions in the&#13;
project provinces. These strategies could include the following points: the participation of&#13;
headmasters to the training undergone by their teachers as a requirement for better feedback,&#13;
supervision and assistance when back in school; the establishment of a follow-up process to&#13;
make teacher training a continuum rather than a one-shot operation; inclusion of instruction&#13;
on textbook use and use of the new instructional material (including the library) in the new&#13;
training.&#13;
8.     Use of Educational Resources.  Three types of books (reading, reference and&#13;
supplementary) are to be distributed under the project, and teachers and headmasters are&#13;
expected to participate in their selection. The TAT will verify that books distributed matched&#13;
the expressed choices of teachers and headmasters. Also, their adequacy in terms of&#13;
attractiveness and interest for young readers, as well as their actual uses by students and&#13;
teachers, need to be assessed by the TAT. This survey will include the reading material&#13;
provided to SMP Terbuka, and particularly their user friendliness. The use of educational&#13;
technology for reference and teaching would also be examined carefully to evaluate their&#13;
potential use in the country.&#13;
9.     Use of Instructional Material. The TAT will survey the distribution of instructional&#13;
material to insure that teachers and headmasters were consulted prior to purchase, that the&#13;
received material met their expectation, and is effectively used in classroom activities. How&#13;
the use of this material is positively affecting student learning should be assessed in loco.&#13;
10.   Student Examinations and Assessment System. The TAT will focus its analysis on&#13;
how student assessment is conducted in classroom, data reported to provincial level, and&#13;
feedback provided back to schools and classrooms for the benefit of each teacher and the&#13;
corresponding students.  Analytical capacity at Kanwil level to study these data and&#13;
managerial capacity to disseminate them are key issues of interest, as well as the use of these&#13;
assessments by teachers to change and improve their teaching methods. With regard to&#13;
examinations the TAT will evaluate the effectiveness of improvements in the preparation,&#13;
administration, scoring and reporting of examination results at the school, district and&#13;
province levels and the impact of this on student learning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 17: Page 3 of 3                      135&#13;
11.   Construction Site andAdequacy. For each province, the TAT will verify that schools,&#13;
and dormitories for students and teachers built under the project were consistent with the&#13;
agreed criteria for site selection. Adequacy of these constructions should be the object of&#13;
observation and dialogue with teachers, students and communities. Three- and six-classroom&#13;
schools in the rural areas constitute an innovation that deserves careful assessment by the&#13;
TAT.&#13;
12.   Scholarship Program. The team will verify in their visits to schools that students&#13;
were awarded scholarships under the program according to agreed criteria and conditions,&#13;
and particularly the wide advertisement of the awarding processes. This will be done through&#13;
a review of sample award documents, documentation related to the flow of information&#13;
among concerned parties, and a spot check of recipients to ensure that the full scholarship is&#13;
actually received and used as intended.&#13;
13.   Science Education Study. The TAT will evaluate the utility of the different packages&#13;
of equipment provided to the different categories of schools with respect to their contribution&#13;
to improvements in science teaching, cost, and ease of use, maintenance and replacement.&#13;
14.   Management Practices and Changes. The TAT will ensure that the proper staff are&#13;
receiving the technical and managerial training at provincial, district, and school levels, and&#13;
that trained staff receive posting consistent with their newly acquired skills. It will also&#13;
ensure that equipment provided under the project is actually used as intended.&#13;
Contract and Assistance&#13;
15.   A contract will be signed between the Central Program Coordination Unit (CPCU) at&#13;
Dikmenum and the selected audit team for a month a year starting in 1997. The CPCU will&#13;
be responsible for TAT's schedule and follow-up. In the provinces the two PPIUs will&#13;
provide the assistance required for a timely and adequate schedule of visits and contacts,&#13;
including remote project areas.&#13;
Duration and Expected Product&#13;
16.   The TAT will survey implementation's progress in the second, third and fourth years&#13;
of the project, and each survey is expected to be realized in a month. The TAT will provide&#13;
its report to the CPCU, the PPIUs and the World Bank for review and comments before&#13;
issuing a final document. The TAT will also ensure that implementation of recommendations&#13;
issued by CPCU or the Bank after analysis of the progress reports are actually implemented&#13;
in the following year. The first audit shall not start before 18 months after the project started.&#13;
