T&#13;
       he final consumption of energy for heating is substantial in the Western Balkan countries&#13;
       (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, and Serbia), as well as in Mongolia and Ukraine.&#13;
       All of these countries have district heating (DH) in their major towns; however, the majority&#13;
of these DH systems are municipally owned and have limited access to adequate investment&#13;
funds, modern management practices, and new technologies. All of the countries need to allocate&#13;
substantial resources for renovating old DH systems over the coming decade.&#13;

At the same time, many of these countries and municipalities         opportunities. Furthermore, the report presents best-practice&#13;

The PPP framework in Kosovo is in accordance with                          and is overseen by the energy sector regulator. The PPP&#13;
international best practice, but only limited implementation               project development, procurement, and award process in&#13;
experience exists today. A few successful PPPs exist in other              Kosovo is illustrated in Figure 4.&#13;
sectors (airport, waste collection), and some pilots are under&#13;
way in transportation (public buses) and education (schools).&#13;
With respect to PPP in the municipal sector, the law allows&#13;
it, the regulatory structure is in place, and the government&#13;
officially supports it. However, the sector is sensitive due&#13;
to social concerns, and there is limited municipal capacity&#13;
for managing PPPs; for DH, there are serious issues related&#13;

to revenue collection and financial viability that should&#13;

Heads of Agreement has been published, and the PPP&#13;
unit has provided positive opinion on 21 new PPP projects,&#13;
including two small heating projects. However, there is a&#13;
general lack of successfully implemented PPP projects to&#13;
date, and three smaller-scale projects in the DH sector failed&#13;
due to inadequate cost recovery, as cost-covering tariffs&#13;
were not implemented and the assets were reverted to the&#13;

In Ukraine, the existing PPP Law (under revision) has a                                                                 implemented under the less-restrictive concession law. The&#13;

by referring to other laws for rules and regulations, rather&#13;
than asserting the prevailing force of its own provisions.&#13;
This complication challenges potential investors to refer to&#13;
legislative acts, which are contradictive in specific cases.&#13;
Moreover, several different bodies are involved in the&#13;
preparation and implementation of PPPs, as the PPP Law&#13;
requests various decisions and approvals of responsible&#13;

authorities at the local or state level. This complexity is&#13;

and awarding licenses for independent power production.&#13;
Municipal ownership of the DH companies and political&#13;
concerns about affordability, however, seem to prevent&#13;
tariffs from reaching cost-recovery levels. The sector is&#13;
burdened by the high costs of imported fuel. In spite of&#13;
subsidies, the companies frequently lack funding for fuel&#13;
and run at low operational levels, with many off days during&#13;
the heating season, which results in low credibility and low&#13;
revenue collection. A new 2014 law enabling the blocking of&#13;
bank accounts in case of non-payment and improved court&#13;
processes is apparently helping significantly. The heating&#13;

In Serbia, the Ministry of Energy and Mining has taken over&#13;
responsibility for the DH sector, which is now covered in&#13;
the Energy Strategy. The regulator will define a common&#13;
methodology for tariffs, but municipalities still approve&#13;
heat tariffs. The Law on Energy includes feed-in tariffs for&#13;
electricity produced by CHP, renewable energy sources, and&#13;
waste incineration; renewable-based heat-only generation&#13;
is not covered under the Law. The heating sector in Serbia&#13;
is illustrated in Figure 12 for the municipally owned Belgrade&#13;

&amp;#12;ROLE OF REGULATOR	&#13;
Table 4 provides an overview of the role of the sector&#13;
regulator in the six countries.&#13;

         Table 4. The Role of the Regulator&#13;
&#13;
          Country            Role of Sector Regulator&#13;
                             Regulation of electricity generation, distribution, and supply is implemented by separate entities; however,&#13;
          Bosnia and         none of these entities have regulatory oversight of the DH sector. The regulation of DH is in practice&#13;
          Herzegovina        exercised through municipal/canton ownership in accordance with the responsibilities allocated to them by&#13;
                             laws on local self-governance.&#13;
                             The regulator establishes heat tariff methodologies (without setting the specific tariff levels) and approves&#13;
                             the tariffs proposed by the DH companies. The regulator issues licenses for carrying out energy activities&#13;
                             and rulings on granting the status of eligible producers. Note that heat and electricity generation are&#13;
          Croatia&#13;
                             commercial activities rather than public services, in contrast to where a concession is given. Independent&#13;
                             heat and/or power production would require an authorization from the Ministry of Economy as well as a&#13;
                             production license from the regulator.&#13;
                             The regulator grants licenses, establishes heat tariff methodologies, and approves tariffs for regulated&#13;
                             energy services. The regulator also grants permits for the construction and operation of new generation&#13;
                             capacity. The regulator prescribes the general conditions for energy supply and the standards of service to&#13;
                             be met by the licensees, and resolves disputes among customers and energy enterprises, system operators,&#13;
          Kosovo&#13;
                             and energy enterprises, as well as between generators. Furthermore, the regulator issues general acts,&#13;
                             individual acts, and secondary legislation in accordance with the Law on Energy Regulation; revises,&#13;
                             approves, and controls compliance with all codes (including the grid and distribution code) as well as all&#13;
                             technical rules; enforces the provision of the Law on Energy Regulation; and imposes fines for violations.&#13;
                             The regulator sets the terms and conditions to obtain a license, issues licences, establishes the&#13;
          Mongolia           methodology to determine heat tariffs, defines the structure of tariffs, and reviews, approves, and publishes&#13;
                             tariffs of licensees.&#13;
                             The regulator approves prices for electricity and gas and is responsible for the grid code. The DH sector is&#13;
                             a municipal responsibility, but in general the role of the regulator is expected to increase with the opening&#13;
          Serbia             of the natural gas market and increased focus on renewable energy. The local assembly will, however, still&#13;
                             have the final approval responsibility for tariffs, and municipalities will retain operational responsibility for&#13;
                             the DH sector.&#13;
                             In August 2014, a National Energy and Communal Services Regulatory Commission (NECSRC) was&#13;
                             established as an independent regulator for the larger DH utilities, and it presently regulates the 227 largest&#13;
                             DH utilities. NECSRCâ&#128;&#153;s main responsibilities include issuing licenses and regulating tariffs for generation,&#13;
                             transmission, and supply of heating and hot water supply services. In addition, the regulator is responsible&#13;
                             for approving the investment programs of utilities, monitoring them through review of their annual and&#13;
                             quarterly reports, and controlling compliance with the license conditions. NECSRCâ&#128;&#153;s current work program&#13;
          Ukraine&#13;
                             includes increasing all of the mentioned tariffs to a full cost-recovery level and eliminating cross subsidies&#13;
                             among the public, budget organizations, and other customers. However, NECSRC is in a challenging&#13;
                             position because of the significant increase in natural gas prices, the non-cost-recovery tariffs of DH&#13;
                             utilities for the public, and the reduced affordability for end-users due to the current political situation in&#13;
                             Ukraine. One of NECSRCâ&#128;&#153;s current priorities is to stimulate utilities to switch to alternative fuels and reduce&#13;
                             gas dependence.&#13;

HEAT TARIFFS&#13;
Table 6 provides an overview of the present heat tariffs&#13;
for unmetered and metered, household and commercial&#13;
customers in the six countries (standardized to U.S. dollars&#13;
for comparison). Because the tariffs vary from city to city in&#13;
most countries, the table shows representative large cities&#13;
for comparison.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
With the different tariff structures across the six countries,&#13;
immediate comparison may be difficult. Figure 14 therefore&#13;

With regard to financial support mechanisms, all six countries&#13;
have feed-in tariffs for the CHP electricity that is exported to          FEED-IN TARIFFS FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY&#13;
the grid, but none of the countries have implemented specific             Table 8 provides an overview of the feed-in tariffs for&#13;

renewable sources. The incentives are backed in all countries&#13;
by interconnection policies that provide CHP and renewables&#13;
with transparent and consistent interconnection procedures&#13;
for selling the generated electricity to the grid. Some&#13;
countries also have market-based mechanisms (such as a&#13;
requirement for new capacity to be CHP, status of privileged&#13;
producer, and Certificates of Origin ).&#13;

Note that the key issues across all six countries concern              sector and affordable heating for households, and to a lack of&#13;
implementation rather than inadequate regulations:                     successfully implemented PPPs in the municipal sector.&#13;

   â&#150;¶â&#150;¶ Although most regulators are independent and                     The key recommendations for all countries to improve&#13;
      the tariff methodologies allow for cost recovery,                financial viability of the DH sector are:&#13;
      social concerns remain a significant determinant in&#13;
      proposing and approving DH tariffs. This is because                 â&#150;¶â&#150;¶ Tariff methodology determination and approval of&#13;
      social protection programs targeted at low-income                      tariffs should be separated from ownership (ideally&#13;
      households tend to be less developed, and affordability                with an independent national regulator);&#13;
      concerns are addressed instead through low utility                  â&#150;¶â&#150;¶ Affordability concerns should, in the longer term, be&#13;
      tariffs, which effectively act as blanket subsidies that               handled through targeted subsidies to the poorest,&#13;
      benefit all connected households.                                      rather than through generally low tariffs; and&#13;
   â&#150;¶â&#150;¶ The legislative framework in all six countries allows for           â&#150;¶â&#150;¶ In the transition phase, performance-based subsidies&#13;
      private sector participation in the DH sector, but there               for utilities may be a solution.&#13;
      is still a lack of successful PPP projects, which may&#13;
      create discomfort for international investors.                   Furthermore, the key recommendations for all six countries&#13;
                                                                       to enable testing of PSP in the DH sector are:&#13;
Furthermore, country-specific issues exist:&#13;
                                                                          â&#150;¶â&#150;¶ Developing a pipeline of pilot projects for PPP in&#13;
   â&#150;¶â&#150;¶ In Bosnia and Herzegovina, complex administrative                      municipal services (including DH);&#13;
      structures have resulted in a multitude of legal acts               â&#150;¶â&#150;¶ Seeking international inspiration or assistance for&#13;
      and regulatory bodies regulating PPP transactions                      transaction structuring of the pilot projects; and&#13;

      driven and differs substantially depending on the&#13;
      locality.                                                        Table 10 (next page) provides country-specific&#13;

&amp;#12;Table 10. Country-Specific Recommendations&#13;

Country                  Key Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                         Due to complex administrative structures and a high degree of decentralization,&#13;
                         a multitude of legal acts regulates PPP transactions. PPP models are split into&#13;
                         different sets of acts and are regulated by different regulatory authorities. The&#13;
                         legal space regulating PPPs needs internal harmonization, with key principles&#13;
                         consolidated within a single document at the national and entity (Federation&#13;
                         of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska) levels. The country should set&#13;
                         clear and uniform PPP policy with regard to all PPP models and provide clear&#13;
                         division of competences between PPP and other country legal acts (for example,&#13;
                         Public Procurement Law). Establishing a single regulatory body in each entity for&#13;
                         concessions and other forms of PPP is also recommended.&#13;
&#13;
                         The legal framework related to the DH sector is incomplete. The country lacks&#13;
                         an Energy Strategy, a District Heating Sector Strategy, and a national legal&#13;
                         document regulating key principles of the DH sector. A Law on Thermal Energy&#13;
                         is in preparation in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina; however, a more&#13;
                         coherent framework regulating DH sector operation in both entities and at the&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina   national level needs to be established.&#13;
&#13;
                         In selected utilities, tariffs do not cover the costs of operation and investments,&#13;
                         although the methodology formally allows inclusion of all costs. Concerns&#13;
                         about affordability and social burden are frequently given as the reason for not&#13;
                         adjusting tariffs to the proper level. There is a need for legal and regulatory&#13;
                         enforcement of the tariff-setting and approval process. One option could be&#13;
                         to establish a single regulator in each entity or ideally a national regulator.&#13;
                         The methodology of tariff calculation also needs revision to take into account&#13;
                         the need for substantial investment in DH infrastructure, and corresponding&#13;
                         adjustments in the tariff-setting methodology.&#13;
&#13;
                         Various social assistance plans exist, but they are not uniformly applied. In some&#13;
                         administrative units, funds are paid directly to customers, whereas in others&#13;
                         they are allocated to the monthly invoice or to companies. Both entities need&#13;
                         to revise their existing household social assistance plans to allow low-income&#13;
                         families to receive direct targeted household subsidies. The program should be&#13;
                         imposed uniformly across all municipalities and cantons.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;Country   Key Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
          Croatia has had some PPP experience, and several projects are under&#13;
          procurement or in the pipeline. Apart from the Zagreb airport, all recent projects&#13;
          are in the building sector. However, AIK (previously AJPP) and CEI expect that&#13;
          there may be significant potential for PPP projects in the municipal sector. It&#13;
          is recommended that AIK identify selected pilot projects in municipal sectors&#13;
          where a potential for PPP exists (for example, waste management, street&#13;
          lighting, and possibly DH) and that CEI provide project development assistance&#13;
          for the pilot projects to demonstrate the viability of PPP projects in municipal&#13;
          sectors and facilitate development of sector-specific tender and contract&#13;
          templates.&#13;
&#13;
          Approval from AIK and the Ministry of Finance is required for all PPP projects,&#13;
          and although the approval procedure has been simplified, the documentation&#13;
          requirements may present a barrier for projects that are the first PPP project&#13;
          in their sector. The parallel 2012 Concession Act includes less-stringent&#13;
          documentation and approval requirements, and the boundary between&#13;
          concessions and PPPs is determined on a case-by-case basis . The risk of&#13;
          strategic representation of PPP-type concessions as not being of a PPP type&#13;
Croatia   in the context of the legislation (for example, to avoid the requirement for&#13;
          establishing a Public Sector Comparator) should be recognized. For smaller&#13;
          PPP-type concessions at the municipal level, it may be beneficial to relax upfront&#13;
          documentation requirements for first-of-a-kind projects or to provide central&#13;
          government funding for selected pilot projects to enable the development of&#13;
          templates.&#13;
&#13;
          New tariff methodologies recently have been implemented, and the first tariff&#13;
          decisions have been made for a number of smaller DH systems. This led to&#13;
          tariff increases, which improved the financial viability of DH utilities, taking an&#13;
          important step toward cost-reflective heat energy tariffs. The key test will be&#13;
          the ability of the state-owned HEP DH (accounting for 6 of the 10 largest DH&#13;
          systems and 80 percent of installed capacity) to propose and receive approval&#13;
          for rational heat energy tariffs. It is likely that social concerns will continue to&#13;
          be a factor in heat energy tariff determination, and there is a risk that such&#13;
          concerns may prevent the timely adaptation of cost-reflective tariffs that are&#13;
          fully compliant with the regulatory framework. It therefore is encouraged that&#13;
          strategies for targeted subsidies that benefit mainly the poorest households be&#13;
          considered and implemented.&#13;
&#13;

Country                  Key Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                         PPP in the municipal sector is allowed by law. The regulatory structure is in&#13;
                         place, and the government officially supports it. However, the sector is sensitive&#13;
                         due to social concerns, and there is limited municipal capacity for managing&#13;
                         PPPs; for DH in particular, there are significant issues related to revenue&#13;
                         collection and financial viability that should be addressed prior to private&#13;
                         investors being brought in. If the government of Kosovo would like to test PPP&#13;
                         in the municipal sector, and in particular in DH, it should consider identifying&#13;
                         selected pilot projects; balancing the concerns about affordability of DH services&#13;
                         and financial viability through structured, performance-based subsidies from&#13;
                         local governments to DH utilities; and seeking international assistance for&#13;
                         transaction structuring of the pilot projects.&#13;
&#13;
                         Currently, affordability concerns are being addressed through blanket subsidies&#13;
                         that benefit all connected households. Strategies for targeted subsidies that&#13;
                         benefit mainly the poorest households should be considered.&#13;
&#13;
                         At the end-user level, an inadequate framework for organizing multi-apartment&#13;
Kosovo&#13;
                         buildings may limit energy efficiency initiatives, as no entity is responsible&#13;
                         for common building installations. New legislation is under preparation at&#13;
                         the time of this writing that may promote the establishment of Housing&#13;
                         Administrations that would take over heat metering and system maintenance at&#13;
                         the substation level. Based on metered consumption of heat, the DH company&#13;
                         would prepare invoices (bills) for each substation, which are sent to the Housing&#13;
                         Administration (as a result, the DH company would receive payment from&#13;
                         the Housing Administration). Meanwhile, the Housing Administration would&#13;
                         prepare separate invoices for consumersâ&#128;&#148;individual apartment ownersâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
                         based on the heated area (or according to calculations by means of heat&#13;
                         allocators), plus typically an extra charge for the housing service. Considering&#13;
                         the technical design of DH secondary systems in multi-apartment buildings,&#13;
                         and the importance of safe and secure operation for reliable heat supply, the&#13;
                         Administrator could engage a third party for operation, maintenance, and repair&#13;
                         of the substation. The third party could be a district heating utility under a&#13;
                         special service contract or any other specialized private company.&#13;

&amp;#12;Country    Key Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
           The policy framework for PPP is in accordance with international best&#13;
           practice, but only one PPP project had reached financial close at the time of&#13;
           this writing. The lead agency role for PPP has moved several times in recent&#13;
           years, reducing continuity. The lead agency also has limited capacity to&#13;
           support the development and implementation of PPP transactions, and some&#13;
           ongoing transactions are implemented with limited transaction advisory. It is&#13;
           recommended that the government of Mongolia consider attracting financial&#13;
           resources and management expertise for utility services such as DH through&#13;
           a long-term contractual PPP. This could be promoted through establishment&#13;
           of a pipeline of selected PPP pilot/demonstration projects and attraction&#13;
           of international support for transaction structuring and implementation to&#13;
           increase the chance of success.&#13;
&#13;
           In spite of significant fuel subsidies (domestic coal provided at production cost)&#13;
           and cross subsidization (between electricity and heat generation as well as&#13;
           between commercial and household heat customers), the end-user heat tariffs&#13;
           do not cover system operation and maintenance costs and are not adjusted&#13;
           to changes in cost basis. Therefore, the DH companies rely on subsidies from&#13;
           their owners, and their ability to undertake necessary system renovations and&#13;
           expansions is limited. The government of Mongolia should address the issue&#13;
Mongolia   of cost recovery in the DH sector. Without a clear and trustworthy model for&#13;
           cost recovery and servicing of loans / payback of investments, it will be difficult&#13;
           to attract private investment in the DH sector unless a sovereign guarantee is&#13;
           provided.&#13;
&#13;
           Currently, affordability concerns are addressed through blanket subsidies&#13;
           that benefit all connected households. Comprehensive tariff reform should be&#13;
           considered to ensure cost-reflective heat tariffs and targeted subsidies that&#13;
           benefit the poorest households.&#13;
&#13;
           In the context of tariff reform, the relation between the heat consumption-&#13;
           based tariffs (presently applied at the substation level) and heated area-based&#13;
           tariffs (presently applied at the end-user level) should be analyzed, as it appears&#13;
           to limit the incentive for switching users to metered billing and thereby the&#13;
           promotion of end-user energy efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
           The present tariff approval process limits the ability of the regulator (ERC) to&#13;
           approve tariffs that ensure that revenues of licensees are sufficient to support&#13;
           their financial viability. It is recommended that ERC consider engaging in a&#13;
           dialogue with the countryâ&#128;&#153;s Fair Competition for Customers Agency and the&#13;
           Customers Rights Protection Agency on approaches to tariff adjustment that&#13;
           balance affordability and financial sustainability concerns.&#13;

Country                  Key Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
                         The 2011 PPP law is in compliance with international best practice. A PPP&#13;
                         unit has been established in the Ministry of Finance, and a practical guide&#13;
                         and Heads of Agreement template have been published. However, there is a&#13;
                         general lack of successfully implemented PPP projects in municipal services&#13;
                         to date. The government of Serbia should consider: developing a pipeline of&#13;
                         pilot/demonstration projects for PPP in municipal services (including DH);&#13;
                         addressing the inevitable conflict between affordability concerns and financial&#13;
                         viability upfront through structured, performance-based subsidies from local&#13;
                         governments to DH utilities; and seeking international assistance for transaction&#13;
                         structuring of the pilot projects.&#13;
&#13;
                         The independent regulator AERS will define a common methodology for tariffs,&#13;
Serbia                   but municipalities still have to approve tariffs. Social concerns are likely to&#13;
                         continue to be a significant determinant in municipal approval of tariffs. An&#13;
                         independent approval procedure (for example, by the regulator) would be&#13;
                         likely to provide a better framework for ensuring the financial viability that is&#13;
                         necessary for development of the sector.&#13;
&#13;
                         The Ministry of Energy and Mining has taken over responsibility for the DH&#13;
                         sector, and the DH sector will now be a part of the Energy Strategy. The&#13;
                         implementation program to be prepared after the adoption of the new Energy&#13;
                         Strategy for Serbia should explicitly consider private sector participation in the&#13;
                         continuous modernization and extension of existing DH systems, as well as in&#13;
                         relation to fuel switching (increasing the use of biomass, municipal waste, CHP)&#13;
                         and end-user energy efficiency.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;Country   Key Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          The risk of strategic representation of projects as concessions rather than as&#13;
          PPPs in order to avoid the formal requirement under the PPP Law should be&#13;
          recognized. For smaller PPP-type concessions at the municipal level, it may&#13;
          be beneficial to relax upfront documentation requirements for first-of-a-kind&#13;
          projects or to provide central government funding for selected pilot projects to&#13;
          enable the development of templates.&#13;
&#13;
          The PPP law could be strengthened in several areas to improve its role in&#13;
          regulation of PPP-type projects and to reduce ambiguity. In the context of the&#13;
          PPP Law, it should be considered to distinguish real PPP projects from other&#13;
          projects; eliminate inconsistencies between the PPP Law and other laws;&#13;
          improve regulation of relationships resulting from land allocation for PPP&#13;
          purposes; expand application of competition procedures for selection of private&#13;
          partners; introduce effective mechanisms and forms of state support for a PPP&#13;
          project; clearly define competencies of national and local authorities regarding&#13;
Ukraine   their roles in PPPs and in the analysis of the effectiveness of a PPP arrangement;&#13;
          and introduce additional guarantees for a private investor.&#13;
&#13;
          Renewable energy sources and CHP could provide important contributions to&#13;
          increased energy supply security for Ukraine. It is recommended that support be&#13;
          provided for development of the biomass / solid waste supply chain and market&#13;
          to facilitate a switch from dependence on imported gas to alternative domestic&#13;
          fuels. High-efficiency cogeneration should continue to be promoted in the&#13;
          interest of efficient use of the fuel sources. Hence, the government of Ukraine&#13;
          should ensure that CHP is an integral part of the renewable energy action plan.&#13;
&#13;
          End-user energy efficiency can be promoted through ESCOs, but, according&#13;
          to the Energy Efficiency Agency of Ukraine, the current subsidy policy targets&#13;
          end-users and may limit the opportunities for ESCOs. It is recommended that&#13;
          legal and incentive barriers to the use of ESCOs in Ukraine are assessed further&#13;
          to enable the testing of ESCOs as a means of implementing end-user energy&#13;
          efficiency investments.&#13;

incentives to reduce costs and deterring investments in                       investments than conventional alternatives. This can deter&#13;

A lease agreement involves a private party (lessee)                                     operation, and the revenue collection risk is passed to the&#13;
taking on the operation and management, as well as the                                  lessee. Therefore, the lessee requires assurances as to the&#13;
implementation of facility upgrades, under a contract with                              tariff levels and increases over the term of the lease, as well&#13;

which the lessee is contracted to implement.&#13;

The lease fee is either fixed or, in case of an â&#128;&#156;affermageâ&#128;&#157; 1,&#13;

&amp;#12;3.2.5 PRIVATIZATION                                                  typically is used to develop a discrete asset rather than a&#13;
                                                                     whole network and is generally entirely new or greenfield&#13;
Privatization may involve full divestiture of an existing utility    in nature. For Build-Operate-Transfer projects, the operator&#13;
or private provision of new assets through Build-Operate-            generally obtains its revenues through a performance-based&#13;
Transfer.                                                            availability payment charged to the utility/government&#13;

Full divestiture of an existing utility usually will be&#13;
accompanied by limitations on the private operator, which            Figure 19 provides an illustration of privatization or private&#13;
will be required to hold a license to provide the service, and       provision of heat generation assets. The revenue basis is a&#13;
such license is subject to termination. Hence, although full         combination of electricity sales to the power grid (under a&#13;
privatization is often considered to be a more final form of         power purchase agreement) and heat sales to the public DH&#13;
private sector involvement in a utility than a concession,           transmission company (under a heat purchase agreement).&#13;
similarities often exist.&#13;

Another form of privatization is private provision of a new          Czech Republic, Poland, and Romania. Box 4 provides a case&#13;
asset through a Build-Operate-Transfer contract. This                example of privatization in Poland.&#13;

&amp;#12;3.2.6 HEAT ENTREPRENEURSHIP                                         risk; here, the involvement of the heat entrepreneur has&#13;
The heat entrepreneurship model has been developed in               parallels to a management contract. Alternatively, heat&#13;
Finland since the early 1990s to facilitate the development of      entrepreneurship may be â&#128;&#156;investment by entrepreneur,â&#128;&#157;&#13;
biomass-based heating plants and DH networks through a              where the entrepreneur (or a third-party investor) bears the&#13;
partnership approach. A key feature is the involvement of the       investment risk, and the involvement of the entrepreneur&#13;
biomass/wood fuel supply chain (for example, through equity         resembles a concession agreement.&#13;
participation in the generation capacity) to reduce supply&#13;
chain risks, as well as a carefully crafted balance of ownership    Figure 20 provides an illustration of heat entrepreneurship. In&#13;
and responsibilities among stakeholders. Apart from this            the example, the heat entrepreneurship does not encompass&#13;
involvement of the biomass/wood fuel supply chain, the heat         heat transmission and distribution, but that could equally&#13;
entrepreneurship model may otherwise be structured much             have been the case. However, the modelâ&#128;&#153;s key difference&#13;
like the earlier-discussed PSP models.                              from the other PSP models is the explicit focus on involving&#13;
                                                                    the biomass supply chain.&#13;
Heat entrepreneurship may be â&#128;&#156;investment by customer,â&#128;&#157;&#13;
where the entrepreneur oversees the practical operation and         This makes the model specifically suitable for the&#13;
maintenance, while the municipality bears the investment            establishment and operation of new generation capacity&#13;

     An example is the Eno Energy Cooperative in Eno            operational and investment costs of energy production&#13;
     (7,000 inhabitants) located in North Karelia in eastern    (when fuel oil is replaced with cheaper wood fuels),&#13;
     Finland. The first heat plant was invested by the          increased use of local labor, and creation of new&#13;
     municipality, but the cooperative founded in 1999 built    business opportunities, as well as environmental&#13;
     two more plants in 2002 and 2004 with a combined           benefits.&#13;
     capacity of 9.5 MW.&#13;

     The Eno Energy Cooperative is now the owner and            (for the local sawmill/pulp mill) and 160 mÂ³ of forest&#13;
     operator (largely similar to a concession) of two          residues and stumps (of which one-third will be left&#13;
     heating centers (heating plant and distribution            in the forest as fertilizer). This in turn yields 40 mÂ³ of&#13;
     network) and the operator (similar to a leasing            bark, sawdust, and other wood residues (from the&#13;
     agreement) of five heating centers. Heat from all          sawmill/pulp mill) and 110 mÂ³ of forest chips (from&#13;

An energy services company (ESCO) provides energy services          by third-party insurance of the energy savings, with such&#13;

The ESCO guarantees energy savings and/or provision&#13;
of the same level of energy service at lower cost, and the&#13;
remuneration of the ESCO is tied directly to the energy&#13;
savings achieved. Therefore, the ESCO accepts some degree&#13;
of risk for the achievement of improved energy efficiency.&#13;

4.1 Overview of the DH Sector&#13;
&#13;
The review conducted of selected DH systems in the six&#13;
countries has confirmed a substantial investment need and&#13;
opportunity in the sector in relation to continued network&#13;
improvements to reduce heat and water losses, switch to&#13;
cleaner fuels, shift to efficient CHP production, utilize waste&#13;
heat, and make energy efficiency investments at the end-&#13;
user level. A conservative assessment of the immediate&#13;
investment needs in the DH systems reviewed is provided in&#13;

            Unlocking the potential for private sector
            participation in district heating
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The report analyzes barriers to and
            opportunities for private sector participation in district
            heating (DH) in the Western Balkan countries of Bosnia and
            Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, and Serbia, as well as in
            Mongolia and Ukraine. Specifically, the report analyzes the
            legal and regulatory frameworks for public-private
            partnerships (PPP) and for DH in each of the
            countries,including an overview of the primary and secondary
            legislation, PPP preparation and approval processes,
            institutional setup of the DH sector, heat tariff-setting
            procedures, etc. In addition, the report describes
            international best practice for various business models for
            private sector participation in DH and provides
            country-specific recommendations to improve the
            attractiveness of PPP in the DH sector. Finally, the report
            provides an estimation of the investment needs in the DH
            sector by country and indicates selected investment
            projects, which are conservatively assessed at 1.5 billion dollars.
