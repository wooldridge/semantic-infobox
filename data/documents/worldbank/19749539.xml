&#13;
  The following is a transcript of an oral interview conducted by the authors of the&#13;
  W.prld Bank's fiftieth anniversary history: John P. Lewis, Richard Webb and Devesh&#13;
  Kapur, The World Bank: Its First Half Century, Washington, DC: Brookings&#13;
  Institution Press, 1997.. It is not a formal oral history, and it is not a systematic&#13;
  overview ofthe work of the person interviewed. At times the authors discussed the&#13;
  planned publication itself and the sources that should be consulted; at other times they&#13;
. Talked about persons and publications extraneous to the Bank. Some interview tapes&#13;
  and transcripts begin and end abruptly. Nevertheless, the World Bank Group&#13;
  Archives believes that this transcript may be of interest to researchers and makes it&#13;
  available for public use.           /&#13;

 [Begin Tape 1, Side A/&#13;
&#13;
 LEWIS: ... the scenario for this interview more than I have, so why don't you-.&#13;
 you've done a lot of different things, we know. When did you come to the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
 BANETH: It wiH be 30 years ago in December. So I've been with every World&#13;
 Bank president except the firstJwo, although Gene [Eugene R.] Black was a very&#13;
 short ...&#13;
&#13;
 LEWIS: Yeah. I know that you were in the Bell ...&#13;
&#13;
 BANETH: [Bernard R.] Bell Mission. I was one of'the "Bell boys" in~leed&#13;
 {inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
 LEWIS: Did you work on industry?&#13;
                                                                                 -&#13;
 BANETH: No, I worked on controls on imports and investment. And then in the&#13;
 second Bell Mission I also took on exports, as David Holland had left.&#13;
&#13;
 LEWIS: I see. And we knowÂ·that. And we know that something--we're also very&#13;
 much interested in the Indonesian experience and we're also into debt. I don't know,&#13;
 Richard ...&#13;
&#13;
 WEBB: Yes, those were the two main areas that seem, were areas that we were ...&#13;
&#13;
Â· BANETH: That makes three, actually, if it's India, Indonesia, and debt. That's three.&#13;
&#13;
 WEBB: Right. And aJso your work in the data analysis and in PRDs [Policy&#13;
 Research Department], data analysis projections .&#13;
&#13;
. BANETH: Oh, EPD [Economic Analysis and Projections Department}.&#13;
&#13;
 WEBB: EPD.&#13;
&#13;
  BANETH: Well, I don't know. I mean, this is a long time span, and I don't know .&#13;
. how much time you plan to devote to it. And I don't know how you stand on the Bell&#13;
  Mission. What are the issues of main interest about it? So perhaps, you know, one ,&#13;
  could just~:.r was the first man out, so to speak, on the Bell Mission. I was the first&#13;
  one to be selected to go with Bernie.&#13;
&#13;
 WEBB: You were in the Bank, a Bank staff member at the time, weren't you?&#13;
&#13;
 BANE TH: Yes, yes. And I think I had written someÂ· fairly sarcastic memo about&#13;
 some report on India. I wasn't working on India in those days, but I had written some&#13;
 fairly sarcastic comments, so Drag [Dragos/av] A vramovic or som~body figured out,&#13;
 well, you know, anyway ...&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                            3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 LEWIS: Did Bernie pick you or somebody else?&#13;
&#13;
 BANETH: I don't think so because I had never met him. So somebody said--&#13;
 presumably somebody--! don't know. I was called in by my department director one&#13;
 day and said, "We'd like you to go to India for a long mission."&#13;
&#13;
 I said, "Okay, provided I can take my wife," because I had just not very long before&#13;
 that finished my military service in Algeria, and I didn't particularly want to separate&#13;
 again.&#13;
&#13;
 So they hemmed and hawed and then said, "Yes." I went to see Bernie, and then I&#13;
 went off to home leave, and I arrived from home leave directly to India and started&#13;
 working before [both speaking at once] Â·&#13;
&#13;
 LEWIS: In '64.&#13;
&#13;
 BANETH: Yeah. [both speaking at once] about a month before Bernie and the rest&#13;
 of the group, and gradually defined the mission-Â·my mission--after some epic battles,&#13;
 whether I would be working on the team on industry or alone in the control stuff.&#13;
&#13;
 KAPUR: Ben [Benjamin B.] King was still in Delhi?&#13;
&#13;
. BANETH: At the beginning. He left in the middle, and I guess subsequently&#13;
  because of my work on coptrols I was a little more involved on the--you.know. about&#13;
  Bernie? The Bank hiring [Andrej de Lattre, and then de Lattre, Bernie and Holland&#13;
  going out to India, then coming back.&#13;
&#13;
 LEWIS: They went out with a draft, right?&#13;
&#13;
  BANETH: They went out with a draft, and they went out for other things. That was,&#13;
  must have been in the summer, early summer of '65, and because I had been on&#13;
  controls they brought me into the confidence of what had gone on, while it was a bit&#13;
  of a mystery for the others why they had come back and forth, because that was&#13;
. obviously the exchange rate discussions.&#13;
&#13;
  So I don.'t know what you want to hear. The mission itself, which I think from my&#13;
  point of view went very well--it was my third mission with the Bank, but obviously&#13;
  the longest. And I found the Indians very cooperative. I became--in a sense it was a&#13;
  lifelong-his life, at least--long friendship with Bhootie [ShriS. Bhoothalingam},&#13;
  who died, I guess, you know, a year or a year and a half ago. I always kept on being&#13;
  in Delhi, and somehow I managed to get along with Krishna Muhti [phonetic] and the&#13;
  others even though I found the controls system extraordinary and ineffective. When;&#13;
                                                                                     1&#13;
  sometime later before devaluation actually came in, but we were discussing&#13;
  whichever way a new exchange rate is established, then Stanley Please and I wrote a&#13;
  memo about what we thought might be a proper rate. And my recollection is that we&#13;
. said between 10 and 15 rupees to the dollar and probably on the lower en~, meaning .&#13;
  closer to 15 than to 10 on the scale.&#13;
&#13;
 LEWIS:. They only got halfway there.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Jean Baneth Â·&#13;
                           October 6, 1992-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  BANETH: Well, subsequentJy, when in fact they did get there, devaluation&#13;
             .                        I&#13;
  happened. We had a-I immediately wrote a memo saying that this is going&#13;
 .backwards, that this is...     Â·       Â·'&#13;
&#13;
 We had a big fight at the next Bell Mission--you remember there was a mission out in&#13;
 '66, must have been, early '66--I.was looking at the next plan. I was dealing with the&#13;
 exports and balance of payments, and there was an export target for export earnings to&#13;
 be increasing by 7 percent per annum. And,I wrote a report which. endorsed the&#13;
 targets, saying 7 percent was the minimum that was needed, and then after having&#13;
 gone through commodity by commodity--and the commodity targets were&#13;
 ridiculously high-~concluded that much more was needed on the manufactures than .&#13;
 was assigned to them, and it wouldn't come with these policies. And in my&#13;
 recollection that's the only time that a green cover report, distributed as a green cover&#13;
 throughout the Bank, was called back. That Wl;lS the IMF [International Monetary.&#13;
 Fund}. We had a big debate with Mr. [D. S.] Savkar, and then they brought pressure&#13;
 on George Woods, I suppose.&#13;
&#13;
   But I'm leaping ahead. I suppose one of the topics much debated was whether the&#13;
Â·Â· Bank had promised or not promised something or oth~r to the Indians and lived up to&#13;
   it or not lived up to it. I don't know how far you [both speaking at once] on that.&#13;
&#13;
 LEWIS: Well, I think I know that story pretty well.&#13;
&#13;
 BANETH: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
Â· LEWIS: I'm interested, though, that you did get tha~ far into specifically .&#13;
  recommending the scale of devaluation.&#13;
&#13;
 BANETH: No, wait a minute. That wasn't with India. That was a memo internally&#13;
 in the Bank which we sent, I suppose, to--what's his. name?-[Irvin$) Friedman, who&#13;
 was the economic advisor. So I don't think it ever went to the Indian government.&#13;
 This was.not about the devaluation formally, and we said whatever form it might take.&#13;
 But we were concerned that, given all the subsidies and this extraordinary array of&#13;
 tools on one side, it was desirable that those be simplified, simplified meaning done&#13;
 away with. And once that happens, we were concerned that things are moving&#13;
 backwards. And in fact my very rough estimate was that the exchange rate for many&#13;
 of these products was something already like IO or more rupees to a dollar so that we&#13;
 shouldn't be working backwards. Bu.t l don't think this was at that point--in fact, in&#13;
 my case, after coming back from the Bell Mission, afterÂ·awhile I was put back to my&#13;
 old division. So India was not really my direct bailiwick at all; this lasted for a time,&#13;
 and then I went back to the ...&#13;
&#13;
 LEWIS: But the .sort of story that was told at the time--and I think to the Indians and&#13;
 to the other bunch of the bilaterals, including the U.S.-was that while the Bell&#13;
 Mission recommended devaluation (I want to ask you a little bit about whether there&#13;
 was any debate.about putting that right smack qn paper up front in the report) but&#13;
 while it recommended the direction, that it was the Fund's game to advise on scale.&#13;
&#13;
 BANETH: That is correct. And my--our concern, I think, was to some extent with&#13;
 the Fund's advice and how the interaction between the Fund and the Indians went.&#13;
&#13;
                                   Jean Baneth&#13;
                           October 6, 1992-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Yes, we had a debate and in fact we had a double debate, and Bernie was in a sense&#13;
extraordinary, and now that I am slightly older, I marvel at his tolerance because in&#13;
the end the recommendation in the main volume was not q1:1ite the same as the&#13;
recommendation in my volume. And this was not an oversight. This- was Â·after debate&#13;
and admitted that he has a summary. He was more in favor, quite probably rightly--&#13;
again, with hindsight--of a s~mple devaluation, explicitly--! don't remember whether it&#13;
was explicitly in so many words in volume one; I think it was.        Â·&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I think so.&#13;
&#13;
BANE TH: I think it was, while my volume spoke of a variety of possible&#13;
instruments,' and this was not, as I said, oversight. This we debated, and Bernie in the&#13;
end decided, "Well, let's leave it that way."        Â·&#13;
&#13;
We did have, internally, debates about what would be the appropriate quote "rate"&#13;
unquote, recognizing that it may not come as a n_ominal rate; however, a lot of that is--&#13;
in my case at least, a lot of my involvement was very superficial between, say; the&#13;
summer of '65 and about the spring of '66 because, as I ~aid, I had gone back to my&#13;
original division, which was Middle East and not India.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, I'd love to-I've tried to do some writing of my own about this stuff.&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: You wrote to me, actually, about it.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: So I would love to pursue this, but I think that in terms of our scarce&#13;
resource of your time, we probably ought to ...&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: You do know about the arithmetic mistake on the 900 million, though, I&#13;
presume? Or not?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, no! Tell me.&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: Well, again, this is some time ago, ~o the details are not there, but 900&#13;
million was the recommendation, and it was reached by adding certain things. One of&#13;
the Executive Directors pointed out to Bernie there had been a mistake in arithmetic;&#13;
it didn't add up to 900 million. So we corrected--or he corrected--the mistake by&#13;
putting in it, so it still came to 900 million, but there was a-double correction.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see.&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: But if you reread the drafts or the documents ...&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: What did it add up to? Less or more?&#13;
&#13;
 BANETH: I don't remember. I don't think that's--the point is, obviously, the 900&#13;
 million, as you would really expect. It was a negotiated, arrived at [both speaking at&#13;
 once] figure, and how you demonstrated [both speaking at once] but it was in this case&#13;
.very evident because in fact the derivation didn't add up to the 900 million [both&#13;
 speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Jean Baneth&#13;
                         . October 6, 1992-Final Edited.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The Indians came in asking for a billion dollars, and then they cut down to&#13;
900 million. Then they had to fill up the ...&#13;
&#13;
BANE TH:Â· What was not clear, I think, very clear, genuinely not clear what was the&#13;
periodicity, the single sum that per annum forever and after [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, that came to be the really great issue of. ..&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: I think that genuinely had somehow not been fully s,ettled. Okay, sorry.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: All right. Well, that's ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Can we talk about Indonesia next?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: What about ft? Big country.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You were there '75 to ...&#13;
&#13;
BANETH:Â· To '79.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: You didn't succeed Bernie directly.&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: No, it was Gordon, David Gordon.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: We)made a trip to Indonesia last, for a week we were there last November, I&#13;
guess maybe the tenth of November, because we, none of us knew anything about it,&#13;
really. We had heard about the technocrats, the "Mafia" and all that, and so we sort of&#13;
wanted to see for ourselves as much as we could, and we got brainwashed pretty&#13;
thoroughly by [Nitisastro] Widjojo and company. Enjoyed it thoroughly. But we&#13;
have this notioq of a remarkably close--by all aid and certainly by Bank standards-&#13;
very close, almost intimate relationship between a lender and a borrower, that&#13;
!'iOmehow the chemistry was right, Bernie and Widjojo. You have this President who&#13;
keeps everything on track or protects in a sense we think the technocrats, gives them&#13;
that quadrant of activity, not oil, not military, but this they can sort of do rational&#13;
things in. And also, I gather, that Bernie had a special line to [Robert S.] McNamara&#13;
in the beginning.&#13;
                                                                             -&#13;
BANETH: That's correct. My Indonesia stories are colored, in a sense. I love the&#13;
country. I've just gone back for a little while. The chairman of the plan organization&#13;
just came to spend the weekend with us in Geneva. So my--1 speak the language. My&#13;
relationship is very emotional, and frankly it's emotional in a different sense also Â·&#13;
because--! am telling this not to complain but to put it in perspective--! don't feel that&#13;
when I came back to the Bank I got quite the deal which anybody else coming back&#13;
from Indonesia got So that's by the way to put it into perspective.&#13;
&#13;
Bernie, when he first went out to Indonesia, it is my understanding, there was a young&#13;
student, graduate student coming to help him carry his suitcase through customs and&#13;
what have you, and he was Widjojo. So, you know, this is the sort of relationship he&#13;
&#13;
                                  .Jean Baneth&#13;
                          October 6, 1992-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                          7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  established and maintained through&lt;?ut. So indeed it was very, very intimate with&#13;
  Widjojo, very close, a mutual reliance. It builds up Bernie to McNamara, ob_viously,&#13;
. but vice versa. There is no question that Bernie's relationship was unique. I think I&#13;
  have had probably a good relationship with the Indonesians, but it was never at that,&#13;
  you know, never this sort of level.&#13;
&#13;
And, yes, Bernie was sent out as McNamara's man. He made it clear he was reporting&#13;
to McNamara; he was not reporting to the department director here--that was also&#13;
~ade very clear and occasionally an adversarial relationship resulted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Indonesians needed some adviCe. They needed money. They needed a stamp of&#13;
approval, and I think all this they got from the Bank. And, yes, it was--and they can&#13;
play this game very, very well. So while Bernie's relation is all that he said, but in&#13;
some sense I think having this relation was also something--Bernie used it, and I&#13;
know very well a~d I was--but also the Indonesians used it: "The World Bank loves&#13;
us," and not without reason. Which was a bit of a problem on the other side, that&#13;
while many countries find criticism normal, it's not just the Javanese culture of no&#13;
criticism; it's also the. special relation which makes any criticism oflndonesia more&#13;
difficult. And not just of the technocrats, but oflndonesia. So Dave Gordon, when he.&#13;
saw that the Pertainina thing barreling up, true, he may have been more outspoken&#13;
about certain things than Javanese custom likes it, but also there was this lovers' tiff: I&#13;
mean, "What do you mean? You'-re criticizing us. Don't you think we can handle it?"&#13;
And this is a very difficult thing to handle, to maintain a useful, relationship without&#13;
blessing everything. And I'm not saying that we always managed to do that,&#13;
maintaining a useful relationship withou~ upsetting the relations. It's not useful if you&#13;
just say everything is wonderful. Now, a lot of things they do is wonderful, but still&#13;
you can't get to cancel several times contracts, paying billions of dollars for it, if you&#13;
haven't made a few mistakes. It is better to cancel than not to cancel, and it would&#13;
have been a hell of a lot better not to start on it.&#13;
&#13;
The technocrats in a sense maintain with the President a similar relationship. They&#13;
are very important. They may not be quite a~ important as it is put out. They're a hell&#13;
of a lot more important when times are tough than when times are not tough. The&#13;
President fully recognizes that fact.&#13;
&#13;
But--so despite all the liberalization they still have 28 automobile--probably more&#13;
automobile brands being quote "manufactured" unquote in Indonesia than in any&#13;
other country in the world because still every bloody importer of three cars, when&#13;
they banned the imports, said, "Why should I be out of this?"&#13;
&#13;
"Okay, you can assemble them."&#13;
&#13;
So they drive them down to the harbor somewhere in Sweden, knock off the wheels&#13;
[inaudible] and they still couldn't come to grips with this. And this is not because the&#13;
teclmocrats don't realize ... Â·&#13;
&#13;
And actually there are two technocrats, two technocratic. groups, so to speak. There is&#13;
the Widjaja group. They use it as a.symbol actually; Not everybody is quite as close&#13;
to Widjaja as [inaudible] Within the group also there are differences. But there is the&#13;
[B. J.] Habibie group--let's call it that way--which is in a sense a successor of the&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                           8&#13;

 Pertamina group. Ibnu Sutowo was a technocrat in his way. The reason the President&#13;
 liked him is because he'wanted something done, it.was done. Now, it was done with a&#13;
 lot of money being spent on it aqd a lot of that money going into pockets. It was&#13;
 done.&#13;
&#13;
 Habibie probably--you know who he is? He's the minister of [all speaking at once]--&#13;
 well, whatever he is. He's the air man, the researclt man and--he's not industry,&#13;
Â·actually, not .the minister of industry, he's the minister ofresearch and of the--he's the&#13;
 runner of the airline [both speaking at once] aircraft factory and similar things. Now,&#13;
 there is a personal relationship also there between Habibie's father and the President,&#13;
 but essentially Habibie was picked up by Sutowo. And he's another group.&#13;
&#13;
 And the CSIS ...&#13;
&#13;
 KAPUR: Center for Strategic and international Studies.&#13;
&#13;
  BANETH: That's right. That's also a. counter-technocratic group. There are several&#13;
  technocratic groups plus the military people, and the President plays on all of these.&#13;
  But essentially, I think, what gives the technocrats their strength is that in the end, if&#13;
Â· Suharto had to speak one thing by which he wants to go down in history, it is the&#13;
  father of development. So when it comes to-~when times are easy, then all these&#13;
  groups vie for power. When not, then the technocrats have a double power. They tell&#13;
  the truth--reasonably--and they are relied on by the bankers and the foreign,aid _&#13;
  community. So the link to the Bank is also very important to them.&#13;
&#13;
  I don't kno~ how much more--1 think basically their instincts were right. Basically&#13;
Â· they could speak to the President and their instincts were right.' Basically the&#13;
  President is, in my view, a decent man with na: great taste for flashing expenses like,&#13;
  say, [Ferdinand] Marcos in the Philippines. He lives quite a modest personal life. He&#13;
  now Jets his family run wild but this a relatively recent phenomenon despite all the&#13;
, jokes about "Madam 10 Percent" in earlier times. Â·so, yes, when it came to big&#13;
  choices, after explanation, after discussions, they went the right way.&#13;
&#13;
 Now, harmony with the Bank is a two-way street. Indonesia was a big borrower, had&#13;
 a good reputation, so when in the McNamara years one also didn't want to suspend&#13;
 lending to Indonesia. And I'll give you an anecdote. I was then representing the&#13;
 Bank, and we were making a loan for shipping, which was really buying--many&#13;
 elements. One element was making a loan for relending to companies to.buy second-&#13;
 hand ships. So before the negotiating team Jed by Emil Salim, who is now minister&#13;
 for environment; was going to come to Washington, I get a message saying that it has&#13;
 been decided that the relending rate should be at least 12 percent. I don't remember&#13;
 actually the exact rate, but I think it was 12 percent. So I said, "Do you actually mean&#13;
 this? Is this a precondition? Because the Indonesians won't like it." Â·&#13;
&#13;
 So I get back the message, "What do you mean, 'D~ we mean it'? Of course we.mean&#13;
 it. The senior vice president has de~ided, so that's it."&#13;
&#13;
 So I go and,see the Indonesians, and I say, "Emil, you know, this is aÂ· Bank decision.&#13;
 You have to prepare for this."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                             9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 He says, "Okay, then we don't go. There's nothing to negotiate. We are not going&#13;
 there for 12 percent. We go to others. There are plenty of people." You know, this&#13;
 was already a time of excess shippingÂ·capacity, so you could buy the ...&#13;
&#13;
 LEWIS: Now, this was what year?&#13;
                                                                                )&#13;
&#13;
 BANETH: I would say it was fairly early in my stay, around '76, but I wouldn't put&#13;
 my absolutely [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
 So, you know, I tell the Bank, "The Indonesians are not sending their negotiating&#13;
 team. They don't want to come because it's a... "&#13;
&#13;
 So I get back a message--and I'm paraphrasing it-"What on earth gave you the idea&#13;
 that this was a'precondition? This is just something we would like to talk about and&#13;
 suggest for their consideration!"&#13;
&#13;
 So, you know, the Bank also didn't want to lose even on given projects. This was .&#13;
 manifest in this case. It was manifest on the transmigration program where there was&#13;
 a bit of a zigging and zagging, but I think on general on the whole we, the Bank, hadÂ·&#13;
 the right instincts. The Indonesians, they were willing, particularly at the beginning,&#13;
 tb talk at many levels and, provided you went around it the right way, take advice,&#13;
 consider it, and often follow it.                         Â·    Â·&#13;
&#13;
 I think Bernie had this--not just th~ relationship, but he was more Javanese in some&#13;
 ways than the Javanese, so, you know, he could, while praising things, sort of get&#13;
 them in the right direction. This deteriorated fairly sharply, I think, with David&#13;
 Gordon, for various reasons. The Indonesians were upset that Bernie should be called&#13;
 back. They were upset that he wasn't at all put in as vice president for Indonesia; he&#13;
 was vice president for East Africa. I wouldn't swear that Bernie tried greatly to&#13;
 smooth that.&#13;
&#13;
 Then there was reorganization, and Asia--you know, every other year we put Asia&#13;
 together and then pull it apart. Well, it was pulled 51Part, and Bernie became vice&#13;
 president. And he stalled; you know, he l~t David Gordon's term expire while looking&#13;
 somebody else. In those days--I don't think he selected me. I think the selection&#13;
 process was McNamara, Peter Cargill and Burke Knapp and whoever, but Bernie&#13;
 accepted it. He had wanted me to be his chief economist; I was chief economist in&#13;
 those days, accepted it knowing that.&#13;
&#13;
 l went out. The Indonesians were a bit skeptical about-in those days I was rather&#13;
 younger than I am today and also not American--my-god, is this serious? But I think&#13;
 we got along fine. I was the only one, I think, before or since who learned the&#13;
 language well enough that when I went to say goodbye to President Suharto it was&#13;
 without interpreter. And that helped, actually, me to inake contact with a lot of people&#13;
 who nobody else had seen, including the minister of the interior who, one way or&#13;
 another, is responsible for half the projects, but he didn't want to speak English, so,&#13;
 you know [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
  The relationship is in a sense a difficult one because you can't criticize in public.&#13;
Â· How' do you criticize even in private?' It is difficult to criticize. The group is by no&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
 means fully united. I mean, the technocrats are very nice to you on the site, but there&#13;
 are also some factions really inside it, and you don't necessarily get along with&#13;
 everybody. But l think it is a country where development in the end is a very&#13;
 important goal of government, and even people who have other goals also are&#13;
 attached to it.&#13;
&#13;
 KAPUR: How do you see the--one sort of sees that, with Indonesia in particular, the&#13;
 problem of nationality with the Bank's [both speaking at once].&#13;
&#13;
 BANETH: Really there's a problem.&#13;
&#13;
 KAPUR: ... as well as the vice president's ...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 LEWIS: My, my.&#13;
&#13;
 BANETH: Then Shahid tried to propose--well, there was an interlude with this&#13;
 chap- then he proposed Ping [Ping-Cheung] Loh. So I said, "Chinese. Let me talk&#13;
 to the Indonesians first." And I went to around and explained, you know, he's coming&#13;
 out and built it up, and then I said, "Only now you can come out." It worked&#13;
 reasonably well.&#13;
&#13;
 Then Shahid proposed him to be my successor.&#13;
&#13;
  Again, I didn't realize until--I had made it a point not to go back to Indonesia for ten&#13;
  years, not to be under the foot of my successor,' in some sense, partly considering that&#13;
  Stanley Please had a nervous breakdown because the governor of central bank&#13;
  wouldn't see him. But anyway, I went back now and discovered how strong some of&#13;
  these memories ar~. Speak of elephantine memories--Javanese memories are&#13;
  somethirig else again. But apart from the personal thing, there was a nationality issue&#13;
' which was quite, quite strong. And the Indonesians, who were rather Javanese about&#13;
  it, kept saying, you know, "Sure, we have no, nothing against him, but we are still&#13;
  considering it. Give it another. .. " And this went on for months. And instead of&#13;
  getting the message, Shahid sort of persisted so that when McNamara came out they&#13;
  told him very nicely, "Wonderful man. We love him and so on, but the President&#13;
&#13;
                                   Jean Baneth&#13;
                           October 6, 1992-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;/&#13;
                                                                                              11&#13;
&#13;
     somehow would prefer not to have a Chinese." .I think it's quite important in some&#13;
     respects.&#13;
&#13;
     I am, by the way, ambivalent about this nationality issue. I hit the roof one dayÂ·when&#13;
     I was here and Â·one of my counterparts in another department called me and said,&#13;
     "Well, you know, you're organizing the debt conference together with the IslamicÂ·&#13;
     Development Bank. Please don't send Tom [Thomas M] Klein because he's Jewish.';&#13;
&#13;
     And I said; "To hell with that: I mean, I'm not going to ... "&#13;
&#13;
     So that forced me a bit to con.sider when do I and when don't I. By the way, Tom&#13;
     Klein went to Jedda and was a great hit: And he went to Morocco and was a great hit,&#13;
     and there was no problem .. So it often is just in people's minds.&#13;
&#13;
      But basically, I think, when you have to work out an intimate relationship, you don't&#13;
      want to burden the people who are working out that intimate relationship with the&#13;
      additional problem of explaining that this is with some problem nationality. So it's&#13;
      perfectly all right, provided you did all the necessary things, to have a Chinese deputy&#13;
      in Indonesia, not getting into the high-level relationships. I think in general it's a bad&#13;
      idea to take a deputy ambassador and make him ambassador in any case because&#13;
      He has established some relations, and it's difficult to make a shift.' But it's very bad&#13;
    . when you have this--not only the intimate relationship, but the image is even more&#13;
      intimate than the relationship. And then to have to justify, to have somebody when&#13;
      the government iii fact is criticized for leaning to the Chinese--which it doesn't do, but&#13;
      it's sort of trying to be reasonably impartial. So I thought it was bad, but I wasn't&#13;
      consulted. Had I been asked, I would have said, "Don't do it." But I was glad'that the&#13;
      Indonesians frankly said .&#13;
&#13;
    . And what really happened, Soedjatmoko [Mangoendiningrat], who had been&#13;
      ambassador here and who was a great personal friend of McNamara's, the Indonesian&#13;
      government asked Koko to, when he Was having dinner tete-a-tete with McNamara, to&#13;
      tell him. They also asked him to tell him to keep me there, but, well, McNamara said,&#13;
      "Okay. We'll get another man out, not for permanent." Very Javanese way.&#13;
&#13;
     I had a rather bad brush with one of the technocratic ministers. He wanted to pÂµt in a&#13;
     team of--1 was administering the technical assistance funds, which was 5 million&#13;
     dollars or so, and basically I could sign any contract oh that There was a technical&#13;
     assistance contract for Batam Island where they were asking a team--1 don't        Â·&#13;
     remember--! mean, I do remember the members, but I won't name them. But one of&#13;
     the outstandfog qualifications of one of the women members of the team was editor of&#13;
     the college newspaper. You can see the huge fees, huge things. So I went to see the&#13;
     minister and said, you know, and then I wrote a letter saying, "Wonderful idea to have&#13;
     a study, but perhaps you might reconsider the te,am." He got--basically asked some of&#13;
     his other consultants tb draft the letter for him, which was a very, very rude letter to&#13;
     me basically saying, "Shut up and put up.'' As I said, the technocrats are not all ...&#13;
&#13;
     So some other technocrats helped me with this. Basically I never had to go back to it.&#13;
     And the others whittled down the fees to something which in the end I could accept&#13;
     but it was a difficult process. But this becalT).e well known, and as one doesn't really&#13;
     have friends, everybody s~id, you know, this particular minister wouldn't talk to rne,&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
which was a bit overdoing it, but, you know, well. So who would make the official&#13;
plea from the government to keep me there? It was he. And he then explained to me;&#13;
you know, that because it was known that we had problems, my colleagues in&#13;
government asked me that I should be the one asking McNamara officially you should&#13;
stay--very Javanese! I'm telling you this anecdote because it's very Javanese. It's&#13;
very ...&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That was a genuine--they thought _he would be the best messenger.&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: No, he would be.the messenger because it would showthat even the man&#13;
who has been known to have problems is going to ... [both 'speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS:    Buth~    was the best, most persuasive, yeah, okay.&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: He may have been, but in the end they brought me back, and this&#13;
happened. I think the relation--this is becoming very difficult because I have to now--&#13;
that's why I told you at the beginning that I have a very special bias on this. You have&#13;
to discount whatever I'm saying. It is a fact that t~ey rejected Ping Loh, then after a&#13;
while Shahid asked Stanley Please to go out, who was the director.here. Stanley went&#13;
out, and he had to come back.over after three months; he had a nervous breakdown.&#13;
Now, I know from my colleagues here that one of the, at least participatory&#13;
[inaudible] The governor of the central bank is traditional governor for the World&#13;
Bank and the main contact, and during his stay here Stanley couldn't get an&#13;
appointment.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That was before he went out?&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: No, no-when he was there. He went out in September or so, October,&#13;
and he came back in December or January, and he could never see the man for-well,.&#13;
it was also a sign as the Indonesians do it. God knows that even when you have good&#13;
relations it's not always easy to see people. It was a message.&#13;
               .             '   .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
After that there were ups and downs. My understanding is, but I'm-maybe, you&#13;
know, I haven't discussed the people; just I listen. I don't ask questions. My&#13;
understanding is that probably Russ [Russell J.] Cheetham was an up, and then there&#13;
were downs and so forth, you know, and every which way; My impression is-but&#13;
obviously I'm biased--that it has never quite duplicated the relationship which we had&#13;
in my days.&#13;
&#13;
Also, I think another change is, obviously even from Bernie's days on, that in Bernie's&#13;
days the Bank's say-so was essential, you know, not only because of Bank financing--&#13;
it was IDA [International Development Association] financing--but consortia. Then&#13;
commercial banks came in later, and very often the Bank's say-so was not, certainly in&#13;
my days--the most important say from me, I thought, was not, "You should go ahead&#13;
with getting that money," but it's what you shouldn't be doing: "Don't borrow too&#13;
much." So that's a very different relationship, and that got, of course, much amplified&#13;
with theÂ· second oil boom and all that. So they needed the Bank less, and that is, I&#13;
think, normal. But as-Bank advice is more controversial in terms of liberalization and&#13;
so on, so I think that also works for relaxed ties.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              \&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
 Then I think our coming on issues of difficulties was within, you kno:w, sad things&#13;
 like environment, what are we doing- to dams--'or not doing to dams--and all that,&#13;
 which ar.e again complicating relationships. And Indonesia's growing up. I mean, it's&#13;
 a dif~erent group. It's a different group of technocrats, also. It's people who are ...&#13;
&#13;
 WEBB: What role was trade policy playing during the time that you were there?_&#13;
 Was it very much on the table?&#13;
&#13;
   BANETH: Not in a, I wouldn't say in a--certainly when I went out the key issue was&#13;
   the finances. You know this was the Pertamina thing, and they were starting to wind&#13;
   that down when I went out, but there were all sorts of pre-Pertamina programs still in&#13;
   the making. So the--one of my main efforts was to get the investment and borrowing&#13;
   plans under control and get some additions made of what are you getting into.&#13;
   Frankly, the first report was, "Just add up your plans." It got into more--not directly&#13;
   qua trade policy, I think, more as industrial policy, but with atrade aspect. It got into&#13;
 Â· greater swing later, focusing on employment and the need to develop a labor-intensive&#13;
   manufacturing, but again in some ways the more urgent aspect of this was saying,&#13;
   "Don't-put all your money into an olefin plant or whatever." You know, that's the&#13;
                             1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   more urgent because once you start investing in it, you'll have nothing left for that, but&#13;
   with the other part also. Not easy, because traditionally the industrial ministry was&#13;
' not a technocrat, not a technocrat in the Berkeley Mafia sense, a different type of&#13;
 ~~oocr~                                                        -&#13;
&#13;
  Towards the very end of my stay we got a letter from the minister of industry, which I&#13;
  very largely drafted myself, but not a stupid [inaudible] "stupid" by which I mean I&#13;
  drafted the letter by which the minister to sign. He signed while giving it ill our&#13;
  report. I made a draft, we discussed, and there was at least halfway commitment to a&#13;
Â· policy which would be stressing labor-intensive-to some extent this was a reaction&#13;
  to what I thought was a sincere but in some ways disastrous expo_sition_ofwhat we&#13;
  thought policy needed to be when McNamara came on a visit. This must have been&#13;
  early '79. It was; you know, very much the large, large investment type of thing. And&#13;
  I went back many times to try to explain, "This is wonderful once you have the&#13;
Â·.money, but the way you'll get there is to get rich first. And t6 get riCh first you have&#13;
. to stress employment, and to stress employment you need to decentralize industry,&#13;
  you need proper pricing and wages. You don't need." You know, the usual speech.&#13;
  In the end there was a letter to McNamara which was by no means as I would have&#13;
  wanted exactly Indonesian industrial policy to run, but it was a very good rnove in my&#13;
  way--even half sincerely subscribed to--in the right direction.Â· So we were--there was&#13;
  a small-scale industrial mission, I think, which was perhaps-you know, you can get&#13;
  details--engineering,&#13;
          /&#13;
                         engineering industry, going in the same direction towards&#13;
                                                                                 .&#13;
                                                                                      trade&#13;
  policy.&#13;
&#13;
 Ther:e was a big devaluation while I was there--'78, I think it must have been--which I&#13;
 can say (but I don't know that it needs to be put down) !'personally was against. I&#13;
 personally was against because the argument was that, given your wage rates, which&#13;
 were very, very low, you know, probably prices are not the main obstacle to--and this&#13;
 comes back to industrial policy. The main obstacle is that you should be able to go&#13;
 from harbor to the factory and back without having to pay fees and all of that, and that&#13;
 lowering the basic wage rate, which in some sense as what the devaluation was_ doing,&#13;
 is probably not the best way around it. And there are inflation implications. They'd&#13;

got inflation under control, and you know-:-there was a debate. I can't, I will not&#13;
pretend--! could pretend, but I won't--that I was intimately involved. I had been&#13;
consulted, but I was not really in the inner circle of--as is very proper, I think that I&#13;
should not be in the inner circle.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Were there other foreigners--the Harvard people or someone? Was HIID&#13;
[Harvard Institute for International Development] more involved in that sort of&#13;
thing?&#13;
&#13;
BANE TH: I don't think so. I think the only, people seriously involved towards the&#13;
end were the IMF an_d possibly--! know at the last few days Bernie was involved. He&#13;
was there by that time privately, but;--and I know in the last few days he was involved.&#13;
How much he had been involved in the--before the decision actually was made, I&#13;
don't know. My suspicion is that they asked quite a few people--oh, sorry. Yes.&#13;
When you said "HIID," I misunderstoo~. I thought AID [U.S. Agency for&#13;
International Development]. No, the Harvard advisory ...&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The Harvard advisory group.&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: ... they definitely put up papers, so they were involved in that sense and&#13;
theywere for.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: They were for the devaluation?&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: They were for the devaluation.&#13;
&#13;
There was a fiscal debate, you see. A part of the debate and perhaps, unfortunately,&#13;
the decisive argument was the fiscal, the worth of the oil revenues ..I mean, in a ~ense&#13;
it's a shadow world, but it's suddenly we increase our current revenues by whatever it&#13;
was, 50 percent. In the end I think they handled it very well, partly because they had&#13;
price controls clappec:J on, and just to make sure that everybody knew they were&#13;
serious, they put the political police chief, Admiral Sudomo; in as price administrator.&#13;
That got the message tprough because otherwise everyone was racing through          Â·&#13;
supermarkets raising every-I bought a bag of lemon, totally local product, with the&#13;
old price crossed out and a new price 50 percent more put on. So you could have&#13;
wiped the whole thing out in a day. What they did is they then, two or three days&#13;
later, froze prices at the pre-devaluation level, put in Admiral Sudomo as price&#13;
administrator, and then over the next few months they relaxed. So, in fact, it was in&#13;
many ways successful, although I always will continue regretting that they didn't&#13;
choose that time to stabilize prices in Indonesia, which were pretty stable and in a&#13;
sense the inflation expectation~ restarted. But it's [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
So, you know, our involvement--! could say that I was not intimately involved. I did&#13;
not actually participate in discussion with Widjojo and the governor of the central&#13;
bank and the president, "Should we be devaluing?" And I don't think Bernie did,&#13;
either. They-asked my opinion. They asked me ifl had a reliable' way of doing it, to&#13;
put it on paper, so I used my administrativ~ assistant to type it. And how much is--it's&#13;
not "they" collectively, also. It's one particularly important player in the game. So,&#13;
you know, I can present this as being a--but in a sense, once it came out; I felt,'you&#13;
know--1 have somewhere an interview by a French magazine which says, "He denies&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                          15&#13;

any responsibility, but by what proprietary interest does he explain the decisions?"&#13;
Obviously we were there. You had a role. Y o.u couldn't be critical in public about it,&#13;
not only because of the relationship, which would have been totally destroyed, but&#13;
broader responsibility of the World Bank. And certainly the decision could~-there&#13;
were plenty of arguments for defending it. Once it has been done, you had to use all&#13;
those {arguments. But that reinforces the special relationship.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Jean, let me ask you about corruption just a little bit. I'm sure my ideas and&#13;
  impressions are very simplistic, but they w.ould be something like this: that there is a&#13;
  very high quotient overall of corruption in Indonesia, one, and, number two, that the&#13;
  Bank probably has had-Â·with almost spotless in its own operations-at least we&#13;
Â· have_n't heard of any, three, that the technocratic sector, those people, have us a little&#13;
  bit puzzled. They seem themselves actually to be very well off and quite comfortable,&#13;
  and so they look as if they have a fair amount of add-on incoine, but they also seem to&#13;
  be operationally pretty immune, but then that they're sort of insulated somehow from&#13;
  the rest of the system. And finally that the Bank has found it useful to sort of keep its&#13;
  blinkers on in this one, that it wants to keep its own business clear but that it's been&#13;
  reluctant to kind of blow whi~tles_ and mess.up this intimate relationship.&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: John, let me relate two anecdotes. One is, Indonesia, I don't know. You&#13;
don't have a proof until you have it. Iran, which was not an uncorrupt society, and&#13;
you have in a sense the demonstration because you suddenly find these people abroad&#13;
and you see who has money and who doesn't, and it's full of surprises. You.know,&#13;
Abdul Majid Majidi~ who ran the empress's charity and had been briefly before-then&#13;
the head of the plan organization, so you would imagine he's got billions and he&#13;
certainly had every opportunity for billions--very, very modest life. Ber daughter&#13;
worked her way through college. And there are many others. At the same time there&#13;
are plenty who with the huge houses in Los Angeles and here and there--so every&#13;
system has surprises, and before it blows up, you don't know who it will be.&#13;
&#13;
Secondly, what you said about-Indonesia; everything is Â·correct, but the technocrats--&#13;
one of the parts of the Indonesian system is to give high level civil servants, including&#13;
ministers, adequate standards of living; I don'.t know whether you. would call it legal,&#13;
but officially. So they have (a) a basic salary; which is not absolutely miserable but&#13;
not very high; second, they are put in three or four or five committees which are, you&#13;
might say, part of their work. You know, you are in a plan organization, but you're&#13;
also the supervisory committee of the popular bank, for instance, on the board. So&#13;
you get another income. You get an offici~I car. You get an official house for which&#13;
you pay rent, but it's a very reasonable rent. And after awryile, like everybody who&#13;
has been in a house paying rent for awhile, you can buy it, but it's official, but.then&#13;
you can rerent it. It takes tiine; it's not your--it becomes your house. It's official. It's&#13;
not corruption in the sense that it's not something--you know, the President makes&#13;
sure that if you want to be living reasonably, then you can live reasonably affluently'.&#13;
Unlike India where I remember a high civil servant telling me, "Is it unreasonable for&#13;
me to wish that my son can afford a Coca-Cola once a week?" In Indonesia they&#13;
always took care that this should be--not high. And .one very high-level person--l'd&#13;
rather not name him, but he certainly had plenty of opportunity to be corrupt--having&#13;
calculated whether he could afford to send his daughter to the D.s (this was fifteen&#13;
years ago) he decided, no, he can only send her to college in the Philippines. So ...&#13;

 LEWIS: ... Widjojo. He has a daughter in school, secondary school, here?&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: No, no. These things nowadays you can afford with the official income .&#13;
you are getting for the various things you are doing. It's, you know, it's not. ...&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I'd like. to clarify, there's one thing which really gives us the [inaudible]&#13;
thatÂ· Widjojo' s quite [inaudible] the issue of conflict of interest is not that&#13;
[inaudible]. . . Â·&#13;
&#13;
 BANETH: No, but let's separate these two things.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: 1 You .said they can be on boards of all these private firms.&#13;
                                            "&#13;
BANETH: Well, let's separate these two things. -It's quite true about the private&#13;
firms. Also, it is not all that widespread:-~at least, it wasn't in my day when I was in&#13;
Jakarta. But the public income is made to be reasonable. So maybe in my day it&#13;
didn't quite run to sending somebody to college in the U.S. or you could [inaudible]&#13;
but find it perfectly reasonable that people-you know, little things like you can travel&#13;
and you can take your wife when you are a minister. You know, it's official. On the&#13;
other hand, I can tell you about people, you know, which may be conflict of interest,&#13;
but it's not worse than the coupon system. I remember people who were high level&#13;
officials, also high possibility for corruption, but when they were traveling on official&#13;
business, the travel agent gave them the maximum number of side trips and they&#13;
would clip basically these coupons, and the travel agent managed to convert that ,,&#13;
every' so often into an additional ticket for the wife. Okay? So it's not the sort of&#13;
thing which perhaps in the U.S. administration you would allow; on the other hand, in&#13;
the World Bank when you get flight--not this sort ofthing--but when you get these,&#13;
whatever, these frequent flyer things, it's yours. So it's not something fonctiom11ly&#13;
more . You have the car. You have the house, which at the very least allows you to&#13;
rent out your private house, and so on.&#13;
&#13;
 Ali Wardhana's daughter may be--Ali Wardhana may be very rich, but one day a&#13;
 young woman with perfectly good credentials turned up at the office--and I was there-&#13;
 -looking for a job as a secretary, without any letter of introduction, and it turned out to&#13;
 be Ali Wardhana's daughter. We hired her, incidentally. She had the best credenti~ls&#13;
 from a secretarial school in London and all that. We hired her; she did very well. We&#13;
 also had a--she's still there, in fact. One of the board mertibers of Bank oflndonesia's&#13;
 daughter, she's still in the office.&#13;
&#13;
  So yes, conflict of interest rules are not very tight. I don't think Â·it matters too much&#13;
  for sittin'g on a board. I think it's much more important that X's wife (quote "wife")--1&#13;
  mean, wife can run a business and .is not to be excluded that the husband being in an&#13;
  official position.helps. Now, at the very least it helps in a system where there are&#13;
  many barriers, .illegal barriers; it helps to have somebody who can cut through the&#13;
. illegal barriers. So there is no illegal action; but it's worth money to have somebody&#13;
  powerful's wife orÂ·daughter-in-law or whatever on your board to go through things,&#13;
  and prob.ably the Bank never really looked at these things. It's difficult to know how&#13;

I,&#13;
                                                                                                  17&#13;

!&#13;
I     to deal with them, and I don't know the truth because I don't ask people their income&#13;
      levels. But I believe that some of the technocrat ministers are very rich, some of them&#13;
      by means which maybe conflict of interest rules might have affected, but probably not&#13;
      five," ten years ago even in the U.S., you know, awife in business, and there's an&#13;
      indirect benefit from having a husband. Other . stories are that it's a .bit more than that,&#13;
      even for some of the technocrats.&#13;
&#13;
      Clearly there are circles. It probably--! never heard of a story of one of the&#13;
      technocratic ministers, you know, Berkeley ministers or similar, intervening in favor&#13;
      of a given business or even a given policy because of his own business interests. May&#13;
      be, but I haven't heard it, and I heard lots of corruption stories. On the contrary, they&#13;
      were very energetic, some of them, but perhaps not--yes, including some who had&#13;
      great business interests--in trying to reduce the barriers, therefore indirectly remove&#13;
      this particular benefit of being able to go through the barriers.&#13;
&#13;
       KAPUR: The Bank's project files on Indonesia--irrigation, transmigration--there one&#13;
     . sees quite explicit references to corruption.&#13;
&#13;
      BANETH: Low level.&#13;
&#13;
     .KAPUR: Yeah, or you know--exactly.&#13;
&#13;
      BANETH: Well, look, the last interview I gave when I went about Indonesia I was&#13;
      asked a question about corruption, and I said, "Yes, there is corruption." So of course&#13;
      the headline was, "World Bank Chief Says There Is Corruption in Indonesia"! It&#13;
      hasn't been held against me.                 Â·&#13;
&#13;
      Yes, and in some ways the government, including the President, is against that sort of&#13;
      corruption, but it is true that conflicts of interest rules are n9t seen the same way, that&#13;
      it is perfectly reasonable for the President's family to be involved in a reasonable--not&#13;
      everybody thinks it's reasonable, not even among the Indonesians, but the President&#13;
      thinks it's reasonable for his children to be involved in-I don't know--a toll roads&#13;
      project where the government gives out the contract. And clearly the technocrats,&#13;
      even if they had power to stop these things in nominal sense, don't have the powers to&#13;
      stop Â·it in the real sense.&#13;
&#13;
       Low level corruption, well, I cari't think Q.f any country where it's absent. Middle&#13;
       level corruption. Then there ~s th_e funny type of corruption which is--how do you call&#13;
       it--and there the World Bank probably did not intervene. For a long time, for&#13;
       instance-I don't know whether it's still the case--you had to have an agent for&#13;
       clearing things through customs. Well, the work involved is not excessively heavy,&#13;
       and it gives you a small but small per item but very reasonable income. You had to,&#13;
       when there was the ban on log exports--sorry1 not on log exports. There was a ,ban&#13;
       first--logs have to be exported in Indonesian bottoms, Indonesian ships. So what is an&#13;
       Indonesian ship? An Indonesian ship is a Japanese ship With Japanese crew, Japanese&#13;
       shore facilities, chartered by an Indonesian company whose only job is to sign the&#13;
       document and get the IO percent or whatever, depending on whose {inaudible] is&#13;
     . getting. It's perfectly legal; it's not corruption, and if she h'!,ppens to be the wife of the&#13;
       governor of the province where the timber concessions are--ym.i know, everybody has&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
 to make a living! These sort of things, very difficult to go after. The society is tied&#13;
 together in all sorts of ways in which money percolates in all sorts of ways.&#13;
&#13;
 No, we didn't get involved in it, and in a sense I don't know how much we can. Let&#13;
 me confess something. When Ibnu Sutowo--the first year I went out, he was still&#13;
 riding high, and I went to his "liberande" reception (that's the end of Ram~dan).&#13;
 There are a million people, many more than at the President's house where I had been&#13;
 coming from, somehow they all [inaudible]. The following year he was in disgrace.&#13;
 I nevertheless wentto his "liberande" reception, and there was Bob [Joseph L.]&#13;
 Lebacq, I think, the Belgian ambassador, and I, and that was it. But I don't regret&#13;
 having gone, even though he undoubtedly took all the money he was supposed to&#13;
 have been taking. , He didn't do it just on his own. .                              Â·&#13;
&#13;
 He did it--perhaps he overdid it--but he also did all sorts of projects the President was&#13;
 telling him to do, or he was volunteering. You know, "It's a di,sgrace that we don't&#13;
 have any motel facilities here."                                      Â·&#13;
&#13;
 "Yes, sir. I'll do something about that." So you have a chain of Pertamina motels,&#13;
 and because they were built up, you know, not a particle of economic justification, so&#13;
 who looks at what the cost is? So everybody is making a bit of money more or less&#13;
 legally because you just tack on one agent, and so he makes his money perfectly&#13;
 legally, and who's to ask if he's just to sign these documents?&#13;
&#13;
  Because you had all these barriers--! was involved with, because we had a site and&#13;
  .services project for tourism, I got a little involy.ed in trying to recruit desperately a&#13;
  hotel because otherwise you would have these beautiful sites and services and no&#13;
  hotel. Now, in fact, there are 15 hotels there. Anyway, Club Med came out. Because            _,&#13;
Â· I am French and because I like to go to Bali, frankly, so I went with them and tried to-&#13;
  -in the end ~they didn't make the deal at that point. They made it, I think, later. The :&#13;
  reason was that they were told very nicely that they have to get local associates, and&#13;
  the local associates; they would have to lend the money for the equity participation of&#13;
  the local associate money! They said, "Look, we are willing to hire quote consultants&#13;
  end of quote and pay the~ a fee, but we very much want local associates but not this&#13;
  sort of local associate."&#13;
&#13;
 But then again many such deals were made, and where is the corruption? The same&#13;
 people who started out by just protection money basically: "If you have me on your&#13;
 board, your goods will go through customs much easier thari if you don't have me on&#13;
 your board." But they ended up perfectly genuine businessmen after a while. So it's&#13;
 very difficult. Yes, it's very important. It does not--when it really became a major&#13;
 hindrance, like in the customs, the government tackled it very effectively and in a&#13;
 very determined fashion.                     ,&#13;
&#13;
 Re~entment   about it clearly is there when it comes to the President's immediate&#13;
 family. It's much more diffuse with the others; it's balanced against the fact that,&#13;
 "Aha! They at least are pribumi, unlike the others." There was a recent article in&#13;
 Warta Ekonomi, which I was given right after my arrival, which lists the fifty richest&#13;
 people in Asi_a, which lists in the whole of Asia five non-Chinese descent, making it a&#13;
 [inaudible} of these other five. Now, you might notice if you reread the article&#13;
 carefully that not even the Sultan of Brunei is listed among the fifty richest people, so&#13;
&#13;
                                  , Jean Baneth&#13;
                            October 6, 1992-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 you start wondering why, and the answer is they don't want to put any heads of state,&#13;
Â·for obvious reasons, so you have to add to the fifty a number of high family. But still&#13;
 there is this resentment among many of the fact that the Chinese are a very important&#13;
 part of this growth, and they are resented when it's corruption, but at the same time&#13;
 the other part of the corruption, "Well, at least he is not a Chinese."&#13;
&#13;
. 1--my impression is that it was very harmful when it came to the large projects where&#13;
  basically on the whole the technocrats were against, although occasionally you might&#13;
Â·have found them ambivalent, and it was never very clear to me whether the&#13;
  ambivalence was because the President's wishes were so clear that Widjaja, who&#13;
  knows where to bend, just didn't want to oppose it at that point or whether the&#13;
  ambivalence was more genuine. And you would be surprised. Widjojo-here&#13;
  Widjaja occasionally about this sortÂ·ofwhat we call in French "qui amundis," this&#13;
  sort of self-rhetoric, and he also genuinely believed that, and he sometimes may&#13;
  genuinely believe that, yes, we do need a huge steel plant or olefin plant or something&#13;
  for development. Certainly Habibie believes it.&#13;
&#13;
So where do you--whether it was just put in because lots of money in it or whether it&#13;
wa,s put in because you genuinely.believe these things are needed or a combination of&#13;
interests and where exactly the technocrats-who's in them, or how strongly they&#13;
went along with it, I don't know. When it came to the crunch, then sometimes they,.&#13;
were stopped, but those which went ahead and even those wh_ich were stopped, there&#13;
was a lot of money to be colkcted. That's where I think the corruption was most&#13;
harmful.Â· It was--in recent years it was equally harmful--it's not the corruption so&#13;
much as the whole system of--what was harmful, to caricature it, is not so much that&#13;
you have to pay a rupee to the policeman as that the policeman had it in his interest to&#13;
stop you because otherwise he wouldn't get the rupee so that y_ou had--that's what&#13;
paralyzed so long industrial development. ~ages were low; workers were competent,&#13;
biddable, skillful, but, boy, getting things from harbor to town and back was just too&#13;
much of a hassle. And that I think they have tackled q'uite--decisive, not quite as&#13;
completely as perhaps you would like to believe, but fairly decisively.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I hear you saying, I guess, that you don't feel that the Bank can be faulted&#13;
for inattention to corruption.&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: I think what the Bank--yes, well. Look. The Bank has a genuine-Bank&#13;
staff have a genuine problem which--yes, I think we can be faulted. First of all, it&#13;
would be stupid for me to say that we are absolutely spotless or blameless [both&#13;
speaking at once] but we have a real problem. Put yourself into the position of&#13;
whether it's the resident in the field or whether it's the mission chief. You need to&#13;
have good relations with your contacts. Okay? At the same time you have to tell&#13;
them all the things that they are doing wrong and stop them from doing things they&#13;
want to be doing. Very difficult-in fact, impossible. And on the whole, with some&#13;
exceptions, if it comes to the crunch, probably the Bank will favor in some sense the&#13;
good relations than the other thing. What you will be told is, "Ah, it's the way you -&#13;
presented it. You didn't argue it well enough" or whatever. I mean~ it's a difficult&#13;
thing to document, but it's my general feeling. So that, yes, we did bring up the issue&#13;
of corruption. I had it in a statement to the press, that was, I mentioned, in public. I&#13;
had a very, I thought, good discussion with the President on the issue. But (a) we&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                        20Â·&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 can't put it in public documents; (b) you probably cannot investigate it very&#13;
 thoroughly.&#13;
&#13;
 As I told you at the beginning, I do not know who is corrupt and therefore I don't even&#13;
 know where the -corruption is. I can point at--and the reason is partly because I&#13;
 haven't really gone into it very deeply. How much could the Bank have gone into it?&#13;
 We probably could have relatively easily done more about our projects where! think&#13;
 the corruption is indirect and not major. One is this sort of fees to whoever. Now, I&#13;
 would take the position that 2, 3 percent is greasing the wheels and what the hell. On&#13;
 the other hand, it is still some thousands of millions of dollars. You can take either&#13;
 position.&#13;
&#13;
  Probably some of our smaller, our projects where I don't kriow how much you would&#13;
  call corruption or whatever, the beneficiaries were more concentrated than we would&#13;
  have wanted. One clear example to me is this fishpond project where there were&#13;
  limits on size, but you didn't have to dig very far to find out that brother and cousin&#13;
  and sister ... Now, you might argue that after all these are people who competent&#13;
 -and expert in the fishponds and--1 didn't feel terrible about ,it, but it's a fact. The&#13;
  beneficiaries were more concentrated. I strongly believe that the beneficiaries were&#13;
  more concentrated than--1 don't think it was significant. I don't think that our projects&#13;
  in that sense significantly suffered, nor do I think that they were really detoured,-you Â·&#13;
  know; that we are oriented toward certain typesÂ· of programs because they were&#13;
  yielding more corruption. I definitely believe that some of our projects were veiy&#13;
  uncorrupt and really very much needed direction, not that we necessarily initiated Â·&#13;
  them, you know, urban, the kampong improvement, the Indonesian staff [inaudible] I&#13;
  think we very much helped. Transmigration, I'm rather for it also [inaudible}&#13;
&#13;
 On the general we got the other problem. Maybe corruption is not a terrible evil but&#13;
 it's very difficult to--or maybe it is. I think in the Bank some people have, "Oh, well,&#13;
 corruption greases the wheels." I personally hold that it may grease the wheels, but it&#13;
 also contributes to the system that first people put on wheels which are squeaking&#13;
 because that's the only way they are going to get the grease. But it's not a direction in&#13;
 which we have--! don't think we have ever done a deep study in any country of. Â·&#13;
 corruption. Now, maybe we should have, but it is bloody difficult to maintain good&#13;
 relations with a government and ..&#13;
&#13;
 LEWIS: Well, the literature is pretty limited, actually.&#13;
&#13;
  BANETH: Well, one reason is that if you don't want tO end up floating in a lake, and&#13;
  it's very difficult tci investigate the truth of stories. What dd you do when somebody&#13;
  says that someone whom I know is corrupt and I would personally be almost willing&#13;
Â· to put myself---certainly my left arm I put out there. But then again, what is corrupt?&#13;
  You know, this story about houses. Is getting a house, cheap terms from your&#13;
Â· employer who is the government? For me that's not corruption. That's a way~ of&#13;
  getting around this limit of not being able to give salaries which at least allow you to&#13;
  be uncorrupt. The.first-I mean, they want to--1 mean, this was developed over the&#13;
  years, and I think it reduced corruption because if you get 5 dollars a month in a&#13;
  society where 5,000 dollar dresses are being sold next door in a supermarket, it is very&#13;
  difficult to avoid corruption. If you get 5,000 dollars a month, then at least if you are&#13;
  not greedy you can afford it.&#13;
&#13;
                                   Jean Baneth&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
. And third, yes, I think the Bank might have gone more deeply. It's very difficult to d.o&#13;
  it by maintaining the relationship. On balance the relationship was helpful. I would&#13;
  put this into the broade'r problem of how .do you get genuine insightful investigations&#13;
  of any problem--technical, economic, corruption--while shielding the investigator&#13;
  from this aura of, "Ah, he's got bad relations!"&#13;
&#13;
 You know, coming back to my case, there was this contract I refused, and I bloody&#13;
 well had to refuse it. B.ut immediately there is, you know--so when you say, "But do&#13;
 you want me to?"&#13;
&#13;
 "Oh, no, but you should have done it differently."&#13;
&#13;
  Now, in the case oflndonesia, this worked out fine in the end. At least, I certainly&#13;
Â· don't mind, but also, as I said, I got genuine help from other technocrats which--I&#13;
  exposed the problem to them, and they said, "Okay, you don't do anything more about&#13;
  this. We'll handle it." So in th.e end--I don't know by what means-but basically I got&#13;
  a letter one day saying, "We are withdrawing this request. We want the request as&#13;
  .much lower fees." Okay, fine.&#13;
&#13;
 But it's very difficult to get there, and what do you do to maintain the relationship?&#13;
 What do you do when the budget deficit is going out of hand and, you know, they say,&#13;
 "Ah, but we have an election. Don't say so. We'll do something afterwards." How&#13;
 do you get...                                                 n&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 l think the Bank has not worked out a way of protecting the people who do the&#13;
 relationship. It would be relatively easy ifthere is visible, explicit pressure from&#13;
 Washington, from people who don't have this one-on-one relationship, to get out.&#13;
 Then you could say, "Look, chappies, I' would trust you, but here is this pressure from&#13;
 the vice president" or the president or what have you. But in fact it has been-&#13;
 certainly in my days as country man--just the reverse.&#13;
&#13;
 LEWIS: We used to do that in [US.] AID all the time.&#13;
&#13;
' WEBB: So how do you evaluate -and find the Bank's relationship with Indonesia in&#13;
  that sense; because so much-you've had, this special arrangement whereas with other&#13;
  countries you do have people here more coldly personally sending evaluations.&#13;
&#13;
 BANETH: Yes, well, even in, I think, in other countries if you look at what&#13;
 happened there's perhaps excessive pressure to be optimistic and not enough&#13;
 protection to the poor economist who is doing the reports so that he can go out again.&#13;
&#13;
 However, !think in Indonesia it worked out well partly because&#13;
     '                                                       '&#13;
                                                                   of the Bank, partly&#13;
 because of the Indonesians. There is, at practically every level, not just these so-&#13;
 called technocrats--! mean, Habibie may be misguided, and he may end every&#13;
 problem by talking about airplanes, but he still wants development. The military, they&#13;
 get rl:ioney, they get many other things, but they genuinely want the good of the&#13;
 country as a whole; they have some genuine commitmenUo the ideal of development.&#13;
 And the people who are most so committed use the Bank to furtheflhat ideal. To&#13;
 some extent even the President did that. But because the Bank was in a 9ertain shape&#13;
&#13;
                                   Jean Baneth&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                      22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and was willing to do certain things, it could be so used. I mean, the Bank could have&#13;
screwed it up, and it didn't, and I think it actively-partly through luck because&#13;
Bernie was available in the early days, partly through the way it works, it helped&#13;
along the proce~s. It helped the move towa~ds liberalization when the times called for&#13;
it. Perhaps it could have done it more energetically and earlier, but basfoally it came.&#13;
&#13;
We could have done a lot more things, I think. We could have stopped this&#13;
proliferation of the bloody automobile industry which is, you know--there are many&#13;
things we--and we had the power to do so, but then the relationship comes in. So on&#13;
balance had we put our foot down, then, for instance--you know, it's a very clear case.&#13;
I'm convinced ifthe Bank had said in 1973 or thereabouts,, '73 through '75--you'll&#13;
have noted that. I very prudently take out the period when I was t~ere-"Stop the&#13;
automobile. Don't do this~ Don't ban the importation. But if you ban the importation,&#13;
finish the [inaudible] okay but not more than three automobile plants." There were&#13;
plenty of allies in Indonesia. I mean, they are not crazy. They realize that you can't&#13;
produce twenty-five. But--so I'm convinced we could have done it and a clear&#13;
economic benefit, clear political cost with some people, you know, all the people who&#13;
got import licenses, who got then the [inaudible] licenses, and they're all powerful&#13;
people. I'm not sure it would have been worthwhile, honestly, taking the total of&#13;
relationships together. It may not even have helped the technocrats because they&#13;
would have been told, "Look, the allies and friends of the technocrats are stopping&#13;
industrialization and money, whatever." Then you would have to come down to a&#13;
choice. "Okay, if it is twenty-five, there is no issue. Everybody can do it, and then&#13;
it's a resources, but if it's three, so who should be chosen?" So how far down do you&#13;
go?                                                                                 .&#13;
&#13;
It's one example I'm giving to say we didn't use fully our power, but I'm not&#13;
convinced that, given the political realities, one could really go farther away. On the&#13;
whole I think it worked out and it continues to work out pretty well in favor of&#13;
development. Now, mind you, like every story, you'll only know how it works out&#13;
when it's finished. As Solon said, "Never say a man is happy until you've seen him&#13;
die." And. we foresee, I think, a difficuh period at the presidential succession time,&#13;
a~d that's an even broader issue, the evolution of the whole regime. How are political&#13;
processes evolving and reconciling with evolving society? How is society evolving?&#13;
&#13;
You know, throughout the world the break-up of the Soviet Union has given a--there&#13;
are many indications, but one of them is a negative signal, that you can never be sure&#13;
that the nation has pulled together. And the Indonesians, when I was out there, I was&#13;
amazed. One. very senior military minister--and we were not just tete-a-tete; he had&#13;
several of his aides with him--and he sort of in a puzzled and funny way said, "You&#13;
know, when our generation goes, I'm not sure that we'll have the country together."&#13;
And there is this genuine question tip. And so in the end this will determine, all this&#13;
will determine how the Bank worked out. But judging as of today I think the Â·&#13;
relationship was on the whole very, very helpful to Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Exceptionally, if you think of the other countries that the Bank has ...&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: I only know well--nobody knows well Asia; but I mean Asia is my&#13;
favorite: I think, well, it's very difficult to say which is exceptional. If you have a&#13;
very good pair of scissors, I would say h's an exceptional pair of scissors, but whether&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                        23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the top blade worked less well or better in other places, given that the bottom blade&#13;
was different, I wouldn't be~able to say.&#13;
&#13;
 I find our relationship with India, which was my other, the other country where I&#13;
 stayed, is in some ways much deeper than with Indonesi~. It's a different way of&#13;
 depth. It's deeper because in Indonesia on the whole Bank staff don't speak&#13;
 Indonesian. On the whole Indonesians don't speak English. They give an illusion&#13;
 because, as they speak two or three languages, the, few words of English they speak&#13;
 are very well pronounced. But I remember visiting a shipping project in Sulawesi,&#13;
 and then people said, "Ah! It's a good thing you speak Indonesian. We have all these&#13;
 World Bank experts who come out, and we tell them, 'Yes,- yes,' and then they come&#13;
 back and they ask us, 'Why didn't you do what you agreed to do?' And what they&#13;
 don't know is that we hadn't understood what they were saying." Now in India you&#13;
 don't have that problem, so the relationship in some senses is much deeper than&#13;
 Indonesia. It's much less intimate. Certainly at the political level it has nothing like&#13;
 the intimacy. I mean, I can't remember any minister I ever knew before Manmohan&#13;
 Singh, and I know Manmohan Singh not because he was a minister but because he&#13;
 was non-minister. While in Indonesia, you know, it's first name and . . . So very&#13;
 different. And I'm not exceptional in that. I mean, people may have a more ... But you&#13;
Â·go to irrigation organizations in a state, what have you, and of course the World Bank&#13;
 goes there in Indonesia also, but the dialogue is in a sense more intimate in India. It's&#13;
 also easier to criticize in India than in Indonesia. So again it's a different level of&#13;
 intimacy. So I don't know how the impact was stronger, better. It's a totality; of&#13;
course, and I quote India simply because I know it.&#13;
&#13;
It may well have been in some sense equally fruitful, much less intimate but equally&#13;
fruitful, in Korea in a very different relationship, never a resident mission or anything&#13;
else.&#13;
&#13;
I think it's fruitful where you have some need for finance, at least at the beginning, a&#13;
group which was maybe relatively narrow or very wide where you can have a Â·&#13;
dialogue and where they have a need for somebody to whqm (a) they can talk and&#13;
more importantly which they can quote as a reference for something, somebody. And&#13;
it may well be satisfied in many places where I haven't been. At the same time, I get a&#13;
lot of evidence that in many cases the relationship is not a happy one, many .&#13;
complaints from pe\)ple one meets about high-level lecturing and not understanding&#13;
the intimate problems, not understanding the politics of things. The Bank probably&#13;
has a tendency to [inaudible] people too much and almost to resent intimate--! don't&#13;
mean -~ctually resent,_put not regard it as natural to have intimate involvement.&#13;
                                                              '             '&#13;

There's the two ambassadorial traditions. When [f'ierre Paul] Can'lbon worked out&#13;
the Anglo-French agreement, he'd been ambassador to England for 22 years.        His&#13;
brother had been ambassador to Germany for 17 years. Nowy.days when an&#13;
ambassador has been in--well, some countries rotate them every two, three years.&#13;
Some countries, like the ex-Soviet. Union, used to maintain them a very long time.&#13;
The Bank is ofthe rotating school. I'm not sure that that's very good, and it reduces&#13;
the role.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Do you think the large office, the large size of your resident office in&#13;
Indonesia, was a good thing, useful? It was quite exceptional. That in Indi'a, also.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  BANETH: Â·First thing, the nature of the office has changed fairly radically. Up to&#13;
. and including sort of my stay, basically you had a unit before me--well, Bernie&#13;
  reported fo god. Dave Oordon sort of reported to the vice president. In my days it&#13;
  was basically a tussle. I sort of--Bernie certainly wanted me"to report to him, and&#13;
  Shahid Husain wasn't sure who the report was.Â· &lt;;::!early today the mission is reporting&#13;
  to the country director, and in fact the mission has been in my days already sort of&#13;
  split up with some units reporting to the unit chiefs here just like India, just like East&#13;
  Africa. It's a Bank tradition not to want to--you know, you put up a big office, maybe&#13;
  it remains big in size, but it changes in nature. The office is big, but the chief is not&#13;
  head of the office.&#13;
&#13;
 I think it was very necessary to have as large an office as you had in the early days&#13;
 because the peopie at the office had very much a technical function. Indonesia had&#13;
 been much closed off from to rest of the world, hadn't got a clue as to how to go about&#13;
 with aid agencies. They didn't know much about even technical conjacts. So, yes,&#13;
 people went out and explained to ministers, to high civil servants how to go about&#13;
 things, and everybody of them was useful. And in addition you had dozens of&#13;
 missions coming.&#13;
&#13;
It is presumably quite useful even nowa9ays because it facilitates--the main role of an&#13;
external man is to facilitate the links between internal man. It's a paradox, but it's&#13;
easier to make sure that BAPPENAS [Badan Perencanaan Pembangun Nasional.-&#13;
National Development Planning Agency} and.finance minister of India or whoever,&#13;
you know, technical ministries and plan commissions, talk to each 'other. It's easier&#13;
for the external man; he promotes the occasion. He is there. That's how he moves&#13;
things along. So in that s~nse it's useful. When you look at the overall size of&#13;
the program of Indonesia's development, I have no doubt that it pays very heavily. I&#13;
wi~h it were better organized in some sense--not just Indonesia, but other things.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 I wish our external officers had a better role. The Bank has a way of getting far back&#13;
 into Washington, and that reduces the role of, once it is seen--you know, Bernie and&#13;
 his men could play a role because it was known that they could go to McNamara, and&#13;
 that certainly boosted the value of his advice. It's much more difficult to establish that&#13;
 sort of relation if it is felt_that what you advise or what you agree to, you know, then&#13;
 you have to refer to the third deputy doorkeeper in Washington. It doesn't make--it&#13;
 puts it much more on a personal level. It's more difficult, and yet there is a tendency&#13;
 for that because that's how the Bank is organized; you need somebody here to go out&#13;
 by next Wednesday and explain to the next man.Â· So there is a tendency to establish&#13;
 things saying, "This is going to be the high-level link to whoever it is," and then very&#13;
 rapidly the thing degrades to a--fitting into the hierarchy.&#13;
&#13;
 This takes you away from my experience to my philosophy, but I guess that you have&#13;
 time.Â·&#13;

nationalities. You had a Japanese deputy?&#13;

Japanese.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: [Shigeharu] Takahashi.&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: Takahashi. And there was a British, [C.H} Thompson.&#13;

&#13;
BANETH: Tommy Thompson--well, John Malone was a bit of a problem, but that's&#13;
true, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Takahashi was seen as an American, wasn't he?&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: In both ways, but I don't think it--yes, he was seen as American. He had&#13;
been out there with Bernie .. Shig was never perceived as the sort of overall policy&#13;
advisor, but he had very good relations. You know, at some level you could--they are&#13;
perfectly willing to overcome nationality issues, and it's also a matter of level, what&#13;
you put in at what level. But I don't think--Shig was seen--obviously, he looked very&#13;
Japanese--but J1e was seen as both, and I don't think it was a problem, whereas John&#13;
Malone came from--he was a funny--this is getting very awkward--but difficult&#13;
associate, how shall I say it?&#13;
&#13;
  Yes, John Malone was Shahid's idea. He came out with great enthusiasm. I don't&#13;
Â· know whether he had been told, as I think Ping Loh had been told, that he would&#13;
  succeed to me. Then he got very disillusioned, and he started talking to journalists.&#13;
  There was this huge, blowilp article in the Wall Street Journal, several of a series&#13;
  about how catastrophic everything was-in Indonesia. /&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Especially on the transmigration project.&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: Everything! And John Malone was very much in there. Then he wanted&#13;
to come home to Washington earlier. And I said, "Fine, let's Jet him." That's when&#13;
Ping Loh came out. Ping Loh, I think--1 don't know what happened.&#13;
                                                     I&#13;
But I think nationality was--you know, there was the positive. They sort of saw&#13;
American as being a good thing. When McNamara went out in a visit to Indonesia&#13;
right after the slipersemar and Suharto had taken over, legend has it that-Peter&#13;
Cargill told me, so presumably it's true--thatas soon as he came back from Indonesia&#13;
his first visit was not to the Bank but to the White House, which may well have been&#13;
appropriate, but, you know, in a sense it was seen by the Indonesians as very much as&#13;
a joint effort where the Bank was taking the lead. So an American was a plus, clearly.&#13;

 BANETH: ... both ways, and one of the first issues I was confronted with was aÂ·&#13;
 paper on financial.flows to developing countries, prospects for financial flows to&#13;
 developing countries, we had to write. Now, I knew nothing about debt except what I&#13;
 had learned in Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
 WEBB: This was '80?&#13;
&#13;
  BANETH: This was 1979, actually, late '79. But fairly early on--and 1 have a copy&#13;
  on my files--1 wrote a note to my supervisor saying, "Having looked at the issue, it&#13;
  seems to me there are two ways of perceiving it One is that somehow developing Â·&#13;
  countries need money on appropriate terms, and there's plenty of such money around&#13;
  in .the world, but there is a market failure. It doesn't go to them. So the Bank may&#13;
  have to intervene to facilitate this flow. The other way oflooking at it is that they&#13;
  can't use money on those terms which is available because of creditworthiness&#13;
  problems, in which case all the Bank can do is to try to get them more aid and try to&#13;
  get them to transform their economies. And it is my perception that it's the second&#13;
  problem that is the real problem." This was early [inaudible] And I was told, "That's&#13;
. not the question;"&#13;
&#13;
 WEBB: This was when in 1980?&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: This is '79, endish, because I came back late September. I have the paper&#13;
somewhere in my files. But more significantly, I think, the debt problem-- I mean, in&#13;
a sense we had a--ifyou look at 1979, '80 WDR [World Development Report}, you'll&#13;
see that the ten-year projection shows still huge financial flows in 1990, positive net&#13;
transfers with implications extraordinarily high, gross flows which (ifl am not&#13;
mistaken) they are still specified there. Underlying. it there is a projected real interest&#13;
rate of 1 percent. Â·&#13;
&#13;
I did this finance paper with a 3 percent interest rate, and it led to very different&#13;
conclusions. But these conclusions did not in those days seem acceptable. These led&#13;
to the conclusion, which I had put in that earlier paper, that the problem was&#13;
creditworthiness by the borrowing countries, that sooner or later these gross flows&#13;
would have to be increasing so much to maintain net transfers that it was not possible,&#13;
and net transfers would b~come negative, while the other side of the Bank was&#13;
projecting them in a sense as positive. And this was not really happily resolved i.n&#13;
1980. We did drafts.                            Â·                                   Â·&#13;
&#13;
The Bank has a problem of being unable to quite distinguish between internal&#13;
argument and documents which ultimately go to the Board, so that every argument at&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                           27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
. some point is inflected--at least that I've been involved in-.by what can we go out in&#13;
  public. So in the end I think we did not tackle what might have been tackled in those&#13;
  days about it. We did not anticipate. It was very difficult even by that time quite to&#13;
  stop a crisis from coming without provoking it because how do you argue with&#13;
  countries where, if you make out something in the economic report, "This.country is&#13;
  on the verge of bankruptcy," you're bloody sure of provoking the bankruptcy&#13;
  immediately. So it's a real problem of the circle put in productiori. But on the whole&#13;
  I think because of McNamara's impulse, the Bank was still working on the argument&#13;
  that "If you only use the money well, then it doesn'tmatter what the interest rate is.&#13;
 Â·Or maybe it matters, but it's going to be low, and let's get more money," which was&#13;
  reflected by all the discussions on getting a Bank subsidiary going (which was Gene&#13;
  [Eugene HJ Rotberg's argument) which can go out to the markets and borrow a lot of&#13;
  money with a 5 percent equity input from the Bank, and this changing ofthe gearing&#13;
  ratio of the World Bank and all of that.&#13;
&#13;
 KAPUR: But that came later, right?&#13;
&#13;
  BANETH: No. That came in '79-'80. All .of that was '79-'80. Yet I think the&#13;
. numbers. were fairly clear. I, because--partly because of my frustrations with this, I&#13;
  went to some absolutely god-a~ful obscure conference on systems research and&#13;
  cybernetics.                             Â·&#13;
&#13;
 LEWIS: My goodne~s.&#13;
&#13;
 BANETH: It was in Cancun, which sounds-I beg your pardon: Acapulco~&#13;
 Acapulco! But I published a paper which said, you know, "In the '70s net transfers&#13;
 from the banking system facilitated things. In the '80s net transfers will be reversed,&#13;
 perhaps brusquely, and this will create problems for developing countries." It so&#13;
 ~appened--obviously, I don't carry this thing around with me-but I have here a paper&#13;
 which I presented in Paris about the Marshall Plan, "From the Marshall Plan to the&#13;
 Brady Plan," it was called, at a conference, historical conference on the Marshall&#13;
 Plan, and I was invited. And I quoted this sentence in French, so I reread it just the&#13;
 other day. I vaguely remembered it.&#13;
&#13;
  It was foreseeable, and I think partly through the right--1 don't know. The Bank did&#13;
  not do what it could have done to foresee it and perhaps to forestall it. As late as the&#13;
  following year--I went to EPD in 1980, around the end of'80 or early '81. When did&#13;
  McNamara leave? McNamara left [all speaking at once] '81. So the last discussion of&#13;
  the WDR main assumptions with McNamara, I did not go, but my boss, Helen&#13;
  Hughes, went. In '79-'80 I had a huge discussion with Helen Hughes and Russ&#13;
  Cheetham, who was responsible for projection of that. In the end we very well&#13;
Â· realized that the main issue was real interest rate. You know, you could still disagree&#13;
  _as to how growth, when would growth "stop growing," but obviously how much they&#13;
  had to grow was the real interest rate issue. We had a big discussion of the real&#13;
  interest rate issue which we didn't resolve, so the WDR went ahead with the projection&#13;
  of 1 percent, and this finance paper used the projection of 3 percent. It made a big&#13;
  difference, and which we had to fudge a little because you couldn't cut it out publicly-&#13;
  -every draft had to reduce a little the creditworthiness--they went into a&#13;
  creditworthiness examination for a number oflarg~ countries, saying, "Well, they&#13;
  can't really go on borrowing like that." This was toned down in every draft.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                           28&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  LEWIS: You used the same growth rate projections?&#13;
&#13;
  BANETH: Oh, yes. Â·I didn't really-it was just the financial slope projections that&#13;
  changed.&#13;
                                                      I&#13;
 I had convinced Helen Hughes by 1980; monetary goals had been changed; 3 percent&#13;
 even looked too low--so I convinced- Helen .. At least she said I convinced her; it's not&#13;
 that I doubt her word but I clearly want to distinguish what I know directly and maybe&#13;
 only colored by my own distorted mind and what I know from hearsay. The way she&#13;
 told it, she went to see McNamara with the 4 percent, and McNamara ruled it out and&#13;
 agreed only to 2 percent as real interest rate projection. And clearly McNamar&lt;:t,&#13;
 nobody's fool, realized that if you have a different one, then you have different capital&#13;
 inflow and so on.       Â·&#13;
&#13;
  So I think we didn't sufficiently look ahead on that. It's very difficult thereafter to,&#13;
  first of all in my own mind, to separate things which I became convinced of later and&#13;
  sooner, how much one knew at the beginning, how much we didn't know, how much&#13;
  was overall knowledge, how much was selective. Again, because I was looking a:t&#13;
  this Marshall Plan--smry, it wasn't the Marshall Plan; it was some other paper I was ~&#13;
. reviewing, which was also for publication--! quoted'from World Bank'ahnual reports&#13;
  from '79 or 1980 to 1987, how we viewed the debt crisis. And it's very easy to quote&#13;
  sentences from the annual report, and it so happened that the section EPD in effect&#13;
  prepared, which showed that in fact one realizes a genuine, long term is going to be a&#13;
  hell of a difficult thing to get out of it. It.also, I am sure, would be fairly easy to find&#13;
Â· senten~es which would say just the contral)'..          Â·                             Â·&#13;
&#13;
   And I don't think we were duplicitous. I think we genuinely did not have a full&#13;
   internal debate, and I suspect h's for the same reason as this inability to separate the&#13;
   internal debate from the external message. I think it makes a lot of sense not to tell&#13;
   fully officially to the outside world in 1982 that Mexico, let's say, Mexico :will never&#13;
.. recover before a debt reduction.. It was too early. How do you give the inessage?&#13;
   What do your shareholders say? God knows what else., How much do you get&#13;
   blamed for if indeed it comes true? I think it might have been useful to have an&#13;
   internal debate, but in fact the Bank doesn't have processes for that. The only way we&#13;
   debate things is in the preparation of papers. The ~nly thing which was sort of in lieu&#13;
   of that internal debate was a CPP, the Country Program Paper, which was specifically&#13;
   intended for that process, but it did not fully remai.n ...&#13;
&#13;
  You almost had the same type of arguinentbefore; I think probably McNamara also&#13;
  did not encourage the sort of paper which would have told him, "This country, you&#13;
  know, forget it." So the process didn't evolve. C~rtainly in the '80s, as far as I know,&#13;
  my leveJ,..-1 was an assistant director and then director of the EPD-we did not have a&#13;
 .genuine internal debate on that i,mtil the Bank reorganization in '86.       .&#13;

 LEWIS: Oh, you mean in '88? Let me ask you about this real interest rate a little bit&#13;
 more. You say McNamara wouldn't buy Helen's 4 percent a year. Would other senior&#13;
 m~nagement? [Ernest} Stem? Did Hollis [Chene;'ry] get into this discussion?&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      BANETH: In '79 .or '80 when--it must have been in early '80-when we were&#13;
      working on this paper and there was the conflict, McNamara or maybe Qureshi, but I&#13;
      think it must have been McNamara, referred it inÂ· a sense to Hollis, who referred it to&#13;
      Hel~n in the sense that she should invite two outside economists to discuss the&#13;
      reasonableness of this real interest rate 'issue, not the rest, just the reaL interest rate&#13;
    Â· issue. I don't recall who the two economists were from the outside. I'm sorry. This&#13;
    . was ten years ago, but I do remember a discussion. So in a sense McNamara and&#13;
      Hollis got involved but not actually adjudicating it. In the end it' wasn't decided. It&#13;
      was a sort of everybody remained on their position.&#13;
&#13;
     The one decision that was taken, .there used to be something called an "inflation&#13;
     committee" in the Bank which gottogether various departments so that an inflation&#13;
     assumption had to be agreed on because it was key to aÂ· number of projections. And&#13;
     in 1979 or '80 it was transformed into a "planning assumptions committee"&#13;
     specifically in order to consider also interest rates. But the interest rate decision then&#13;
     got taken by McNamara. To the best of my kllowledge it was Helen and McNamara,&#13;
     with others not really getting involved in the--McNamara took a very great interest in          ~&#13;
     these projections, and he approved these planning assumptions or what have you,&#13;
     projection assumptions. Now how much Helen actually pushed for it, you know, she&#13;
     clearly had not been fully convinced herself. She had remained an optimist, and so .&#13;
     she may not have--l'm quite convinced she put up the case. She may not have had her&#13;
     heart in fighting for it. So I don't know what really happened, but anyway.&#13;
&#13;
     KAPUR: But McNamara left in June of'81.&#13;
&#13;
     BANETH: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
     KAPUR: Already things had not yet come to-Mexico was still a year away. What&#13;
     happened from that point?&#13;
&#13;
/    BANETH: Obviously, I recall it much better when I was right than when I was&#13;
     wrong. So I don't really know what happened, frankly. I'm trying to remember.&#13;
     1982, I was involved fairly heavily in making the first draft of the Part I of WDR&#13;
     which in the end was rejected and Bevan Waide took it over. And my recollection is&#13;
     that I came back to my "da-da" that net transfers will be tu'ming negative, but I&#13;
     haven't reread that draft for probably ten years.&#13;
&#13;
     KAPUR: Do you have it with you? Or ...&#13;
&#13;
     BANETH: My God! It is somewhere. Ifl"have kept it, which is by no means sure, it&#13;
     should be in Geneva. But I think my recollection is that I don't think it was central to&#13;
     rhe rejection.&#13;
&#13;
     There were many--it was Â·a very difficult process. Hollis was still here, but he&#13;
     basically had lost interest. Bevan was nominally in charge, but he--there was-I'm. Â·&#13;
     trying to remember; I suppose it was agriculture, but was it'Millard Long?Â· I don't&#13;
     remember who was the team leader. We drafted something. It was an early draft. I&#13;
     thought it was pretty good. I think it had this part also in it, as I recall, but they didn't&#13;
     like it. Then the team, the core team, redrafted something. And I was at the meeting&#13;
&#13;
                                        Jean Baneth&#13;
                                October 6, 1992-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    with [Alden W] Clausen when Clausen said he had gone around the world. "We've&#13;
    been everywhere. WDR is very prominenrin offices, and they are very good quality,&#13;
    and, Hollis, I think this is not it, particularly the Part I." So back to the drawing&#13;
    board. Hollis didn't want to take a hand, and Bevan asked me do I want to redraft.&#13;
/&#13;
    Well, by the time I was pretty peeved, and I said, "No, I certainly don't want to&#13;
    redraft." So they redrafted. In the end it was a sort of a hodge-podge. It did not have&#13;
    negative fund transfers put in.&#13;
&#13;
    Again, it's very difficult to know, you know, what could you Â·have done with that&#13;
    projection. You could have said, I think, fairly convincingly that, "If not a train crash,&#13;
    at least a very, very painful braking lies ahead." I said that. That is documented&#13;
    there. My memory does not--and I did it very much on purpose to get it on paper,&#13;
    sufficiently low key that it didn't create a debate. But so what?&#13;
&#13;
    LEWIS: That would have been the '82 WDR?&#13;
&#13;
    BANETH: No, sorry. Before that. I'm coming back now to my '80, and I'm pretty&#13;
    sure that in '82 I would have put that-that was late '81--1 would have put thCJ.t it in&#13;
    also. That's my recoliection, but I haven't really [inaudible]       Â·&#13;
&#13;
    But so what? What could you have done with that prediction? My colleagues&#13;
    working on _Mexico would tell me that, ye~, of course they knew what was coming on&#13;
    by late '81. So what do you do about it? Now, how genuine this is? How much did&#13;
    they did know? How high that went? I believe that Clausen had been told by&#13;
    [Nicolas] Ardito Barletta that there's no problem until practicafly the last minute, but I&#13;
    wasn't there so I can't really explain to it. But supposing you do know? So what do&#13;
    you do about it? What Mexico was doing by '81 is borrowing very heavily in short-&#13;
    term to maintain--you know, I think until 1979, '80, Mexican borrowinÂ·g was quite&#13;
    reasonable. I don't think corruption was worse than elsewhere. They did build a lot&#13;
    of infrastructure. Oil revenue was coming, so why not to borrow? Then when the oil&#13;
    revenue came, instead of repaying they borrowed even more. And because they&#13;
    couldn't go on borrowing long-term, they were shorter and shorter so the gross&#13;
    problem for the following year went up very much. Sure, the problem would have&#13;
    been less if you stop it in '80 and '82, but it would have been your problem more than&#13;
    their problem. So how--I'm not sure how-what could have been done. Probably it's&#13;
    at least good to know and conduct analysis to the end, probably that never happened&#13;
    in an explicit way. There are all sorts of statements by people, "Yes, we knew," but I&#13;
    don't think there was a genuine report saying to any vice president, "Mexico is going&#13;
    to have a crisis next year."&#13;
&#13;
     LEWIS: Footnote question: the Development Committee at about that time--must&#13;
     have been in '79--those were the days when they used to have task forces, and there&#13;
     was a task force on nonconcessional flows, proposed by and chaired by Mexico. Do&#13;
    .you remember--does that ...&#13;
&#13;
    BANETH: I remember nothing about that. I may not have been--1 mean, my&#13;
    financial episode was just a year. We had the [Willi] Brandt Commission papers, a&#13;
    lot of them including the gearing ratio and some discussion on that. There were all&#13;
    these ideas about the Rotberg or the [both speaking at one~]&#13;

 BANETH: Gearing ratios. Rotberg was against gearing ratio change. He was for the&#13;
 Bank's Bank, and I thought all this was a bit sort of funny.&#13;
&#13;
 But, anyway, then came the debt crisis.&#13;
&#13;
 KAPUR: I'm sorry; I have just another question. Just looking through all of Ernie's&#13;
 files and everyone else's files, it is just absolutely-and all the Mexico LEAP&#13;
 [lending, economy and program] files, the CPP discussion of Mexico in early '82,&#13;
 spring '82, and Clausen's own visit to Mexico ...&#13;
&#13;
 BANETH: Clausen's visit I know. He had been told at the highest levels, "There are&#13;
 a bit of difficulties here and there, but nothing really very serious."&#13;
                                                              /&#13;
 KAPUR: But internally in the Bank, at least, I think there is absolutely no place&#13;
 where this was told, at least at the s~nior level. Or there's no evidence, at least.&#13;
&#13;
  BANETH: You know, it would be wonderful ifl could tell you I explicitly recollect&#13;
  having warned about Mexico. I don't recollect anything about that problem. I know&#13;
  that for this paper we were planning iri '79, at the draft level we had bullets of country&#13;
  creditworthiness discussions, and now that you mention, it comes back. I would like&#13;
Â·.to know what I wrote about Mexico. I don't remember. It so happens it sticks in my&#13;
  memory that we wrote something about Brazil, not that it's going to go bust, but it&#13;
  bloody well better start reducing its borrowing right away because otherwise the&#13;
  shock is going to be much more severe. I simply have no-recollection at all. I'm sure&#13;
  we did say something about Mexico. I have no recollection about it. I know that this&#13;
  general overall discussion at each successive draft was sort of whittled down. I don't&#13;
  "remember any--in fact, I don't remember any involvemef}t in these issue~ ,in 1979.&#13;
&#13;
 Now, EPD, y~u must know, when I went there the debt division was a very technical&#13;
 debt data division. It wasn't at all asked to or expected to go into issues of&#13;
 creditworthiness or how much thershould borrow, just how much had they borrowed&#13;
 two years ago. And it's only subsequently that it was transformed gradually into a&#13;
 more analytical department. And after my--basically I don't really recollect internal&#13;
 discussion whatever about Mexico. I know that my colleagues, when I discussed with&#13;
 some of them, they said, "Oh, of course we knew it was coming," but' how it was&#13;
 documented or whether or ...&#13;
&#13;
 The two are not actually-in some cases, as I said, there is a great deal of funny&#13;
 pressure in the Bank: "Don't provide advice which people don't want to hear." You&#13;
 know, it's almost, "Please, Â·sir, tell me what is it that you want me to advise you." I'm&#13;
Â·caricaturing this, obviously. It's a real problem. It's a real problem, and I don't think&#13;
 the reorganization or anything resolved this, creating_ a mechanism for at some level&#13;
 genuinely airing issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    JeanBaneth&#13;
                            October 6, 1992-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Much, much later--I'm now jumping ahead-when, after the reorganization, there was&#13;
 no vice president, David Hopper-asked a few of us. There was--my recollection is he&#13;
 asked John Holsen and me to his house. __ Be had just become, you know. "What is the&#13;
 biggest problem, economic problem, in the world whic~ I should raise to [Barber B.]&#13;
 Conable's attention?"&#13;
&#13;
 And we both said, "Debt. The debt strategy, the so-called [James A. III] Baker&#13;
 strategy, is not working."&#13;
&#13;
 Sb he asked us to make a paper, Act4ally, we did two papers. One was just for&#13;
 Conable's eye and the other one was a bit broader but still very, very restricted. And&#13;
 there was an enormous battle about whether there should be in fact a fask force for&#13;
 discussing the issue, not on what the results will be, but whether there should be even&#13;
 a discussiori of the issue. And in the end sort of Conable agreed that there should be aÂ·&#13;
 task force, which roughly lasted for six months, very difficul_t because then everybody&#13;
 and their brothers had to be in it. Then after awhile the instruction was, "Get a .&#13;
 consensus." Well, you have a lot of consensus, but it is very difficult to get a&#13;
 consensus saying (a) from people who are reporting to higher-level people who are&#13;
 saying (b), you know. But it's in my recollection the only time when you had a&#13;
 discussion, a very serious one, whose ultimate aim was not some form of quasi-public&#13;
 paper, and it was not a process happily taken by many people.&#13;
&#13;
  So I don't think there were these things in the '80s. And it's normal in many ways&#13;
  because if you have a limited tool, you wantto use it. You know, Jamaica: if you&#13;
  want to help Jamaica, you can't do it by just talking. You can'tÂ·do it by IDA money&#13;
  because it's too high, so you have to do it by Bank money.Â· But if you have to do it by&#13;
  Bank money, then you have to have a rationale for .using the Bank money. The&#13;
  rationale has to include that they can repay. That has to involve certain both external&#13;
  assumptions and internal assumptions. The future is unknown, so the range of&#13;
  plausible assumptions is fairly broad. If the alternative to making these assumptions&#13;
  were to say, "We can't do anything today to help Jamaica except to tell the world that,&#13;
  you know, you are helping," .then the chances are that the pressure is to come up with&#13;
  assumptions, none of which is completely ridiculous, does nothing for the [inaudible]&#13;
  the whole concatenation of which might look pretty odd because, you know, 10&#13;
  percent probabilities or even 2Q percent probabilities, but 50 of them together, it&#13;
  makes a pretty low probability there. But there is a mechanics for provoking--from&#13;
  the best of reasons. It doesn't even have to do with my wanting to get my lending&#13;
Â· program through because I want to get the brownie points. I just want to help&#13;
  Jamaica. I want to help it today, and God knows what will happen in five years. So&#13;
  there_ is a pressure which--that way.&#13;
&#13;
 To some extent the same thing you play with.the debt system, the debt problem. The&#13;
 only means available for the Bank were structural adjustment lending for immediately&#13;
 relieving liquidity pressure, so you make the effort for structural adjustment lending,&#13;
 and that involved in a sense saying that that will Â·help resolve the problem. And so, Â·&#13;
 because you couldn't be sure in any case that it won't resolve the problem, there was&#13;
 this inclination to do so.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Jean Baneth&#13;
                           October 6, 1992-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                Â·.                                          33&#13;
&#13;
   KAPUR: But you were asking--was the intellectual analysis or a frank intellectual&#13;
   analysis within the Bank, precluded by what were perceptions or 1""hat may or may&#13;
   riot be received from the U.S. Administration? -.&#13;
&#13;
   BANETH: Oh, I don't think it's just the U.S. Treasury. Look, let's put that particular&#13;
  Â·myth to bed. Treasuries were together. There was one particular debt--you know, I&#13;
   used the World Debt Tables preface as a tool for a message which was not quite&#13;
   official. We pretended that it wasn't because the more serious regard, the more it&#13;
   became an official document. But we didn't clear it because, you know, we finished&#13;
   calculations today and tomorrow we have to get out. So it was fairly[inaudible]&#13;
   One.day we said something about debt relief or something to that effect for Africa, for&#13;
   the poorest countries in Africa, whatever the wording was. And it wasn't the U.S.&#13;
   Treasury who organized the pressure; it was the French Treasury. So, you know, it's&#13;
   not just the U.S. Treasury. Obviously, it's more important, and it's a lot closer. And&#13;
   th~ Hill is important, and it's a lot closer than other parliaments, but it's not only that.&#13;
&#13;
   Yes, there was pressure. But I think it came in more cases implicitly. It's not, "Don't&#13;
   say that!" It's,. "We may better want to avoid saying that, and undoubtedly&#13;
   Treasuries' reactions--in the plural, rather than just the U.S. in the singular-played a&#13;
   role in the attitudes of senior management. But probably indirectly it precluded somÂ·e&#13;
   analysis, the use .of some analytical tools.&#13;
&#13;
    I think one should have a--it's perhaps both the cutting up ofresponsibility between&#13;
    the finance divisions, which frankly were not very strong. The people under Joe [D.&#13;
    Joseph] Wood, which, you know, people whom I took over for a year, they were not&#13;
    very strong analytically; they were; through the right of processes,. relatively not very&#13;
    high flyers, had gravitated there. Between EPD, which had been going into these&#13;
    mechanical projections which were pretty good but they were not terribly credible;&#13;
  . between the country divisions, and there was no strong interaction; and the lack of a&#13;
    genuine forum where to analyze things without having this ultimate goal of&#13;
    publication. And I recognize it, you know, even in my--even I, as a [inaudible] on&#13;
    that, I found' it very difficult to organize discussions without having a publication at&#13;
    the end. And once you have that, then you have this, "Well, what is it"--ultimatefy&#13;
    comes into it-"what is it that we can publish?"&#13;
&#13;
   WEBB: This restraint, as I understand it, is very natural, but do you think that has&#13;
   changed over time in the Bank, if you remember back? [both speaking at once]'&#13;
&#13;
    BANETH: In some ways, going back to the old Banl&lt; when I came in, it was not an&#13;
    intellectual--1 mean, it didn't have this high level of debate b~cause basically we didn't&#13;
. _ have a World Development Report. We didn't have a world picture. We didn't have&#13;
    any regional reports. Th~re was a lot Of debate about country economic rep0rts, but I&#13;
    don't think it was a large Â·issue. I think what McNamara did bring in is much more . .&#13;
    intellectual ferment on lots of issues.'So probably the debate got'enlarged. But.the&#13;
    format it took, that issue perhaps didn't arise very much in the early days, but&#13;
  Â· probably it was.less publication. Certainly we didn't have any publication except the&#13;
    original one.         -&#13;
&#13;
   I re.member when I first wrote something for puqlication, and my'boss thought yes, it&#13;
   should be pubiished but under-an assumed name, and sent it to Burke Knapp, who&#13;
&#13;
                                      Jean Baneth&#13;
                              October 6, 1992-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  34&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     ,said, "NotÂ·even under an assumed name." It was something pretty innocuous about&#13;
      international payments issues. There was no publication policy. McNamara said,&#13;
      "Publish, and it doesn't have to be a Bank view." So obviously, it created ferment,&#13;
      but in a sense the fem:ient was by that canalized around the publications and reports.&#13;
&#13;
     I don't think it changed for the worse. Â·Frankly, I'rri not convinced it changed for the&#13;
     better. I don't think the reorganization provided for that, or maybe it did, but it sort of&#13;
     fell by the wayside. The Bank genuinely, I think, in comparison to many&#13;
     organizations, is good for intellectual deb~te, but it lacks this last stage of getting the&#13;
     debate separate from, "Now we have resolved the issue. What do we do about it?" I&#13;
     think there are two debates in many cases. "What do we do about" in public may be 'a&#13;
     different debate for an organization like the Bank with shareholders and all that.&#13;
&#13;
      LEWIS: I hear you talk; it reminds me very much of the dilemma of public&#13;
      forecasters. I used to be in the forecasting business, and if ymi're with the staffof the&#13;
I     Council of Economic Advisors or a member of the Council of Economic Advisors&#13;
      you're very aware that you can create self-fulfilling prophecies, as you say. And as&#13;
      you get the WDR as an instrument, you also have much more clout as an institution.&#13;
      What you say does have a real impact in the real world.Â· I'm much more impressed Â·&#13;
      with this as a hypothesis as to what some restraints than pushing from Treasuries from&#13;
      the outside. I think it's really people who are very concerned. First of all, you get a&#13;
      bunch of people who are trying to make things come out right, have good answers.&#13;
      They're optimists, and things get chancy, sort of, but they can still see a positive road&#13;
    Â· ahead. What they say about it is going to have a lotto do with how things move until&#13;
      some realist like you comes.along Â·and says, "Does the risk look big?" and shows that&#13;
      it isn't likely that that road doesn't haxe a great big hole in it.&#13;
&#13;
     BANE TH: Â· Yeah, but again, in eac.h separate country you cannot prove it, and&#13;
     furthermore it's a little--if you have no alternative to it, it's a little like the triage, you&#13;
     know: this chap is unlikely to recover, but if that's my forecast then you make sure&#13;
     that it's realized because you move on to the next man. It's not as if you say, "Let's&#13;
     put him into intensive care." We don't have intensive care. Basically take the&#13;
     Jamaica case--it so Â·happens I was. involved in the discussion--but, you know, you&#13;
     don't have aid, cheap money, for Jamaica. We orily have Bankmoney. So it's that or&#13;
     nothing. And if it's nothing, then it's not as ifthen our people would jump in with 1             /&#13;
&#13;
     some more. So it's not just an intellectual argument. If you say they can't repay, then&#13;
     you can't lend. If you can't lend, then they are going to suffer much more today .. And&#13;
     I think that's a very weighty and a very honest-perhaps wrong--to do it that way.Â·&#13;
     Perhaps it's wrong not to make it,,at least in some internal document, clear what's the&#13;
     argument. You know, that's why I would prefer that process. It isn't there.&#13;
&#13;
     So I'm a bit optimistic on import elasticities. I'm a bit optimistic on [inaudible] Yes,&#13;
     there was pressure from Treasuries, even at my level, but it was not the determining&#13;
     thing. And often you find that you can say the same thing in words which in the end&#13;
     become acceptable and you find that, "What the hell have I,". you know, you haven't&#13;
     lost so much.                  Â·                        Â·&#13;
&#13;
     But also, you know, opinions lead back people, not under pressure in.Washington,&#13;
     publicly. Lots ~f people thought that the strategy of just waiting a little will work,&#13;
     that world recovery wa~ going to be much stronger than it proved to be, that there was&#13;
&#13;
                                         Jean Baneth&#13;
                                 October 6, 1992-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                     35&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
elasticities down there responding to devaluations. It probably came as a surprise to&#13;
the IMF that devaluations promoted inflation  so   that everything is wonderful except&#13;
that, you know, the inflation: "If only the inflation hadn't eroded it away, then we&#13;
would really be in business today."&#13;
&#13;
Also some things were unforeseen. Certainly the growth rate of the '80s, which was&#13;
another big debate: "What will be the world growth rate?" In 1980 the '70s were&#13;
looked on as an aberration of low growth rates in the industrial countries. Of course,&#13;
the 1980s turned out to be lower than the ' 70s, and now the World Bank is&#13;
forecasting the '90s lower than the '80s. But that wasn't how we looked at it, and&#13;
probably if you had had a 5 percent growth in the industrial countries rather than&#13;
whatever it was--2--things might have turned out differently.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It was the era of stagflation.&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: Yeah. Many other things were genuinely--not only genuinely--it was&#13;
reasonable to make mistakes. It was reasonable not to recognize the paradigm shift&#13;
that had happened, for instance, on interest rates. I mean, why did I say 3 percent?&#13;
Because I remembered [William J.] Fellner telling me at Yale thirty years ago that 3&#13;
!percent was roughly what the British bonds yielded in the nineteenth century, so I&#13;
thought a reasonable bottom. I mean, it didn't really go very much beyond that. I&#13;
thought that in the long run the '70s and late '60s were an aberration. Also, I was&#13;
more open to Europe than others where real interest rates were never quite that low as&#13;
 in the US. But it wasn't dishonesty or even stupidity to think that shorter term&#13;
horizon. I mean, what relevance are the 1850s? So you look at the '60s and '70s:&#13;
 "Well, you know, the interest rates are low."&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: At the same time, Anne Krueger had shifted the intellectual leadership at&#13;
the World Bank and the Bank's public rhetoric was much more-seemed to be much&#13;
more directed at problems of the LDCs [less developed countries] which were&#13;
.endogenously created, although there were both things, of course, the endogenous&#13;
environment [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: No question.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: How did you see that?&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: Well, I would certainly be well to the left; if that's the word that we want,&#13;
of Anne Krueger. She knew that; I told her that. I think Anne herself probably never&#13;
underestimated external factors and probably ne_ver underestimated the difficulty of&#13;
making internal adjustments. She would have, on more than one occasion, expressed&#13;
herself more simplistically than she would find [inaudible] Let me say that she--I&#13;
never had any pressure on me personally on this matter I'm presenting with you. To&#13;
use&#13;
 -&#13;
    the {inaudible] bankers' conference&#13;
                               '&#13;
                                        situation were discussed by-not only we had&#13;
the World Debt Tables and so on, you know, we had discussions, but in the end I&#13;
would go with what I thought we could get away with, but not just with Anne. But&#13;
also Anne encouraged a number of other people who did not have quite her&#13;
intellectual powers and whose views and the way of expressing it were much more&#13;
simplistic.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  Jean Baneth&#13;
                          October 6, 1992-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       36&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Secondly--and that's i;iot just Anne--there is a general and genuine difficulty of&#13;
knowing how much weight you should place on the internal political obstacles of&#13;
somebody doing something. You see, nothing is more pernicious than to say, "Of&#13;
course, the government knows what it needs to be doing. Unfortunately they can't for&#13;
political reasons. But they're good guys so we should help them" because in the end&#13;
then what distinguishes the good guy from the bad guy? Now, Anne may have gone--&#13;
and certainly some of her followers have gone too far away from this. I would also&#13;
say that probably Anne overestimated the-well, underestimated the general supply&#13;
problems, overestimated the supply elasticities in some countries and therefore&#13;
underestimated the time it will take to help with their debt.&#13;
&#13;
Moving away from the "blame the external world," yes, I think she was part of that.&#13;
She was part of a current. I don't think it's just Anne; If you read some other high-&#13;
level people's pronouncements, you know, there was a McNamara rhetoric which&#13;
towards the end was sort of detached from the reality of the purse strings. At the&#13;
beginning it was tremendously rousing and effective. It remained rousing but less&#13;
effective, but at some point of "rousingness" when you see that there's no effect, then&#13;
you feel a bit, sort of--it's very awkward.                             Â·&#13;
&#13;
Clausen certainly didn't encourage that rhetoric, but, you know, one of the more&#13;
controversial statements which created him lot of problems, as he discovered, was his&#13;
so-called Tokyo speech, Clausen's Tokyo speech, where he said the third world is&#13;
over. This was before the debt crisis, incidentally, so everything-it was all private&#13;
sector and lots of money from the migrants, remittances in the future and so on. That&#13;
had been drafted-let's get names on the table-Â·by [Shahid} Javed Burki. I had seen,&#13;
some of the drafts and it's on record that we said, "These numbers are nonsense."&#13;
Well, not otherwise nonsense. Clausen went ahead with his speech. Ernie had not&#13;
been involved in the process at all and he wrote, but too late, I mean, too late not to&#13;
respond because he didn't see the whole thing, a devastatingly critical ...&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Javed. Who else was it?&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: Javed Burki. Javed Burki. And people were, you know, who had been--&#13;
well, it was the new rhetoric. This had nothing to do with Anne, and Anne may have&#13;
disagreed with some of the criticism I made of some of the implications of that, about&#13;
how the private market is going to, all the capital is going to go to the private market.&#13;
Again, net transfers came in there when I saw that, you know, maybe the lending in&#13;
private markets is going up but net transfers are increasingly public and projections I&#13;
got also. So it must have been before the debt crisis. I don't remember the date of it,.&#13;
but it can be found easily. It was not an Anne Krueger message.&#13;
&#13;
The times had changed. The times had changed, and Amie l,(rueger in a sense had&#13;
changed with the times. She personally, I think--and I don't know that we parted on&#13;
friendly terms [inau,diblej--1 think she, restrained by a strong intellect, she would not&#13;
say anythi,ng stupid, or if she would say it, sheÂ· would go back on it. We all say&#13;
something stupid like tha~. She also, however, was very strong in her loyalties and&#13;
may not restrain some not so clever statement or more one-sided statement by some of&#13;
her associates; it was an admirable private quality but not aJways a good public       Â·&#13;
quality. And, yes, she was very insistent on trade policy; that had been her field. We&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                  Jean Baneth&#13;
                          October 6, 1992-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             37&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       were in full agreement when it came to trade policy in India--or lack thereof, rather. I&#13;
       wouldn't think that it would work, say, in South Africa,' but I'm not sure she would.&#13;
&#13;
       You know, I was asked--very funny--! was asked to comment. I had been deputy&#13;
       director in Helen Hugh~s's department, and the time came, she was going to leave,&#13;
       and I went to see Anne Krueger and said, you know, "Would you make me ... "&#13;
&#13;
       And she said, "I don't know. I'm thinking about it."&#13;
&#13;
       Well, I decided that I would look for alternatives. Happily, Bilsel Alisbah then told&#13;
       me that they were lookingÂ· for both a chief economist for Africa and for a residerit in&#13;
       Cote d'Ivoire. And I went to see David Knox, asked to see me, and I told him, "Look,&#13;
       I'm attracted more by the resident position than by chief economist," because I had&#13;
       been chief economist, "but I would take either. But I would like to be director there,&#13;
       and if Anne Krueger takes me, I'll take that." And then I told my--secure in my&#13;
       knowledge, I told my--I mean, I was acting director-told the assembled division&#13;
       chiefs that I don't know who the next director will be, but I could tell them who the&#13;
       next assistant director will not be. Anyway, I wanted--l'm saying this--1 really wanted&#13;
       that position. I wanted it very much.&#13;
&#13;
       Anne Krueger gave me a paper to comment on. It dealt with Papua New Guinea and&#13;
       there was something about devalu~tion and being [inaudible] And I didn't know, but&#13;
       I. suspected she would favor that. And yet I came out arguing why I did not.think that&#13;
       was the position, for a variety of reasons connected with real wages and so on. She&#13;
       liked it very much, and when she called me in about, you know, whether ideologically&#13;
       we would not be on a different wavelength, I told her, "I probably would not be as&#13;
       opposed as generally as you are to public enterprise. I would be more concerned .&#13;
       about how it is being managed and a few other things. On the other hand, on trade&#13;
       policy I, again, you know, I think--I certainly agree with the importance of it, broadly&#13;
I      on how it is to be don~." Where we may have differed is I was perhaps more&#13;
       conscious--though I have to be careful not to speak with hindsight--of the difficulties&#13;
I -&#13;
I      of supply responses in some parts of the world. But how strong?&#13;
&#13;
       So I don't thin_k--no, I think she went with the times. She may have contributed to&#13;
       them. I don't think she was an essential factor in the change in rhetoric .&#13;
&#13;
      . In a sense I'm not even sure that it was Clausen directly, although he certainly&#13;
        contributed. Yes, then the U.S. Treasury does come in indirectly. You know, IDA&#13;
        has been negotiated at a certain level, and it had to be geared down. The Bank's very&#13;
        existence had been questioned. There was vei"y dfrect interference, it is my&#13;
        understanding--although I don't have it from Anne; I have it frorri another high-level&#13;
        source--in some of the nominations, not so much from the Â·Treasury U.S. as from the&#13;
        Treasury transmitting what Capitol.Hill or what certain congressmen wanted.&#13;
&#13;
      But the times had changed. I mean, [Ronald W}Reagan was popular not only in&#13;
      America and it gave a certain message and l think the Bank went with it--with some&#13;
      dissent. I told you I remember Ernie's scathing attack on the process and the&#13;
      substance of parts of the Tokyo speech in writing afterwards, but he hadn't been&#13;
      involved. I mean, one of the problems was the enormity of the issues [inaudible]&#13;
      public sector [inaudible]         Â·&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That would have been in '81?&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: Very early on [both speaking at m:ice] I suppose i1,1 '8l, but I don't&#13;
remember. But in a sense it was a very different message of the world to the&#13;
developing countries. That was the Clausen message. He was then told by--I guess it&#13;
must have been LG. Patel. Was I.G. still in ...&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Yes, I:G. was at that conference.&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: No, no. It wasn't. It was in his visit to    India~   Eithed.G. or Manmohan&#13;
must have told him.Â· I don't rememberwho he was.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I.G. was still in India. He was at probably [inaudible] or maybe he was still&#13;
[both speaking at once] World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: No, it goes back [both speaking at once] I think it was I.G. as reserve&#13;
bank governor telling Clausen how he felt badly about it, and Ciausen-you know,&#13;
that also shook Clausen. I didn't realize the sentimental implications of his speech.&#13;
Way back.&#13;
        ,                                 (&#13;
It's terrible to be reminiscing and dropping names, obviously. Again, I know that one&#13;
has a tendency to remember very genuinely and honestly one's own role better than it&#13;
was. And I know that I remember some writings as being terribly prophetic, and&#13;
when I look them up, they were far from being quite so prophetic. It's a construction&#13;
of the mind, and I hope you will take that into account. I'm not lying ...&#13;
              I&#13;
LEWIS: No, no, no.&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: ... but I know it's being occasionally colored by what one wishes to have&#13;
done.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I was curious about one thing, Jean. In that speech that Javed apparently&#13;
wrote, are you saying that Anne was more or less approving of that?&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: No, I think Anne was not fully approving intellectually of some ofmy ...&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I know two or three years later they were bitter adversaries.&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: ... of some of my dissent. No, no, but wait a minute. I mean, Javed had&#13;
many roles, and this time he was the-Anne thought that some of my dissents on&#13;
private sector role and differences between developing and so on were overdone, but&#13;
she certainly did not stop them, did not try to stop it.&#13;
&#13;
Anne was a very complex--! mean, everybody is a very complex person. My&#13;
relationship with her was sometimes difficult, more so towards the end than in the&#13;
beginning.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: But she did recruit you for that job, wasn't it?&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
     BANETH: Yes, she did recruit me in the end, as I told you. I had been actually in&#13;
'   .Rochester being a discussant of a paper of hers on the World Bank, and I got a&#13;
     telephone call just before presenting my paper that, you know, she is the likely next&#13;
     vice president. Well, I had written my text, so what the hell!                      Â·&#13;
&#13;
    No, she recruited me. She didn't always have harmonious relations.with everybody.&#13;
&#13;
    LEWIS: No,      rio.&#13;
      BANETH: I think she continued to have for me and I know I continue to have for her&#13;
      great intellectual respect. She could almost deliberately close her mind to something,&#13;
      but you could open it for her. And I never found her persisting ill a discussion in silly&#13;
    Â· opinions, and I never found her penalizing you for a well-argued opinion. She could&#13;
      be devastating for small mistakes.                       Â·&#13;

&#13;
    BANETH: ... increase by 6 percent when they mean the inflation rate was 6 percent,&#13;
    you know, and she could just tear people fl part for this sort of thing. And she could&#13;
    tear people apart for very correct statements w~ich she had misunderstood and they&#13;
    somehow couldn't communicate. There was somebody saying that governments may&#13;
    oppose devaluation because it lowers the--[inaudible} the terms of trade. Well, Anne&#13;
    was for devaluation in many cases as a policy, and the way, she defined it, it didn't&#13;
    necessarily involve deteriorating terms of trade the way this chap had defined it. I&#13;
    pointed that out to Anne: "Anne, it's tautological. He defines it as the exchange rate&#13;
    lowering export prices," you know, and in fact in reality it does that, that's why you&#13;
    are selling more, but never mind. And this man had been rather admired by Anne&#13;
    before. Pffft. She just crossed him off, but not because she resisted the idea in a&#13;
    sense: it was because he had not been able to communicate it correctly. And I don't&#13;
    think in this particular case she held it against me that,( explained.&#13;
&#13;
    She--we got an absolute blast from .her at some point because we defined devaluation&#13;
    as a lowering of the exchange rate while many Americans--or Americans are&#13;
    undecided, but, you know, sometimes so they--you know what I mean. They raise the&#13;
    exchange rate from 10 rupees to 15 rupees per dollar. We always defined it a certain&#13;
    way, and there was a footnote; she got into a long argument, "Why are your numbers&#13;
    different froin what ram told by EPD?" Â·Well, it turned out they were the same&#13;
    numbers, arranged fairly differently. We got a blast. I got it back w!th a ~airly&#13;
    sarcastic set of, collection of how various people are using it--she went along with us.&#13;
    She said, "Okay. Now I know what you are doing. I am not going to do it, but if you&#13;
    think it's okay for the Bank to do it, fine. Tell the Bank to do it." She didn't actually&#13;
    get into the fight on our side, but she didn't-so it was a difficult relationship. But&#13;
    first she could be a very, -Very-however, I don't think her--&#13;
&#13;
           although I don't agree with many of her ideas.&#13;
&#13;
    LEWIS: Did you find her and Ernie generally together on issues?&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: It's an interesting question. I think Ernie got at some point, but&#13;
[inaudible]--my perception would be that at some point Ernie got to use her to&#13;
criticize country plans in the sense of, you know, pushing towards tougher measures&#13;
domestically. So that very often and somewhat surprisingly--they were very differeot Â·&#13;
personalities--but in fact I wasn't really interacting regularly. At some point Anne&#13;
really started to be dissatisfied with my way of representing whatever it was called in&#13;
those days--ERS, I think, or whatever; yeah, ERS--in the Loan Committee, so she&#13;
replaced me by [Constantine] Michalopoulos. So after that I did not get much&#13;
involvement, but my impression, secondhand, is that in fact in a surprising number of&#13;
cases Ernie went along with Anne's message, or vice versa, I'm sure [inaudible]&#13;
Anne had great respect for Ernie, intellectually. I mean, there is no question aboutÂ·&#13;
that. It's difficult to be here and see him juggle nineteen balls up in the air&#13;
[inaudible] respect. Anne ha9.certainly no delusions about...&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: ''she wasn't running Ernie, I take it.&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: No, but she didn't try, and she--Anne did have genuine respect for&#13;
intellect. She had, I think, excessive contempt when she saw fuzziness, and she&#13;
sometimes even saw it when it wasn't there, just genuine questioning, but she&#13;
certainly had respect for intellect and she had it for Ernie. Â·&#13;
                                       \&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, this has been ...&#13;
&#13;
BANETH:     T~at's   it?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: ... this has been very, very rich and: ..&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: Let me ask you a question on a differerit Bank issue. It's in a sense&#13;
topical again, and maybe will oecome topical for me: project evaluation&#13;
methodology, this [Herm.an G.} van der Tak - [Lyn] Squire method, which I guess is&#13;
still our Bible.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: It's a kind of passport.&#13;
&#13;
BANETH: Well, more generally, what do you see about the history of that?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: We haven't really gotten into that too much. I mean, just the first impression&#13;
I get walking around is that the Bank hasn't had a very, hasn't had a single and&#13;
mechanical formula or method of project evaluation. It went gung-ho at a rhetorical&#13;
level for project evaluation methodology; then it didn't apply very much.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Talking to Lyn Squire, social cost/benefit was their only--in a number of&#13;
projects it was applied [inaudible] ,&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Well, sure. Ian Little recently made a comment to that effect, that he'd&#13;
[inaudible] retroactively his own recommendations and [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                   Jean Baneth&#13;
                           October 6, 1992-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            41 Â·&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 BANETH: ... those days I guess McNamar~, but I don't know that survey. I know&#13;
 that on the social rates of return Hollis made. a sort of task force of van .der Tak, Bela&#13;
 [Balassa] and myself, on the social aspect, not the economic. And at least on the&#13;
 social Bela and I were aligned, and yet van der Tak kept out'Voting us, from which I&#13;
 concluded that McNamara was on the side.&#13;
&#13;
 But there's a broader question, you know: what is it the Bank should be doing?&#13;
 Supposing every one of our projects had been absolutely A-1 grade, perfect project,&#13;
 100 percent rate of return, wonderful benefits and so on. So what, you know? Is that&#13;
 what we should have been doing? Suppose that every one of our projects is shown to&#13;
 have negative rates ofreturn? So what? Maybe that's exactly what we should have&#13;
 been doing because the negative rates would have been even bigger otherwise. So I&#13;
 don't know that we have, or that one can develop, a specific todl for an organized, for&#13;
 a small number of projects. It's one thing to have possibly a tool for all projects.&#13;
&#13;
 I have very serious doubts about the van der Tak method. In those days I was quoting&#13;
 Robert Louis Stevenson: "I have a little shadow. It goes in and out with me. And&#13;
 what the use of him may be is more than I can see." There's a memo in the files!&#13;
&#13;
 But, you know, it's one thing if everybody applies such a thing, but what is it that the&#13;
 organization which just finances some projects should be doing to maximize not its&#13;
 projects' rate of return but its own usefulness, its rate of return, in some sense. Arid I&#13;
 don't think that the--1 mean, there is a lot of fuzzy discussion of this in economic&#13;
 literature; I don't think there's any hard discussion .. Certainly neither Ian Little nor the&#13;
 van der Tak thing really attacked that problem, and I'll be damned ifl know! But I&#13;
 was interested ifthat comes up in the ...&#13;
&#13;
 What is the schedule for this? When are you actually ...&#13;
&#13;
 LEWIS: Oh, that's an embarrassing question!&#13;
&#13;
 BANETH: All right. That's wrong.&#13;
&#13;
 LEWIS: Maybe 1994 if we're awfully lucky and get fast pens we might ...&#13;

        <abstracts>
            On October 6, 1992, Jean Baneth was
            interviewed by the Brookings Institution on behalf of the
            World Bank Group Archives oral history program by John
            Lewis, Richard Webb, and Devesh Kapur. During his tenure at
            the Bank from 1962 to 1994, Mr. Baneth worked in the
            following areas: as an economist for the South Asia and
            Middle East department (1962-1966); as an economist for his
            resident mission in India (1966-1970); as a senior economist
            for the South Asia department (1970-1972); as a chief
            economist for the regional office for Asia and South Asia
            (1972-1975); as director of World Bank resident staff in
            Indonesia (1975-1979); as an assistant director of financial
            analysis for the programming and budgeting department

            economics Vice Presidency (1987-1989); and as director at
            the Bank's Geneva office (1989-1992). In the years
            after this interview, Mr. Baneth became senior adivsor to
            the office of the President (1993-1994). His transcript
