I. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. BANK PRE-WAR INVOLVEMENT IN ENERGY&#13;
1.    The Bank has been heavily involved in the energy sector in Bosnia and&#13;
Herzegovina in the past, notably in electric power, petroleum and natural gas. Power&#13;
sector projects, which benefitted partly or exclusively BH included the Third Power Loan&#13;
(Loan 386-YU; US$75 million; 1972) and the Fourth Power Loan (Loan 1469-YU; US80&#13;
million; 1977), both of which helped finance the development -of SFRY's interconnected&#13;
power system; the Fifth Power Project (Loan 1561-YU; US$73 million; 1978) was for&#13;
development of the hydro power plants on the middle Neretva River; the Sixth Power&#13;
Project (Loan 1561-1-YU; US$61 million; 1983) was for construction of the Mostar dam;&#13;
the Seventh Power Project (Loan 2338-YU; US$120 million; 1984) financed SFRY's&#13;
energy management system; and the Eighth Power Project was for the Visegrad hydro&#13;
power plant (Loan 2527-YU; US$125 million; 1985). In the petroleum sector the Bank&#13;
financed the First Petroleum Project (Loan 2597-YU; US$92.5 million; 1985) for&#13;
development of indigenous energy resources. In the gas sector the Bank financed the&#13;
Sarajevo Air Pollution Control Project (Loan 1264-YU; US$38 million; 1975). An&#13;
Emergency District Heating Reconstruction Project was approved by the Bank's Board of&#13;
Directors on May 14, 1996 (Credit TF024034; US$20 million). The Bank did not&#13;
previously finance projects in the coal sector in BH.&#13;
B. NATURAL GAS&#13;
2.    Background. The gas system in BH was developed starting in 1975 under the&#13;
Bank's Sarajevo Air Pollution Control Project (Loan 1264-YU). Russian gas is supplied&#13;
via Hungary and Serbia and enters BH at Zvornik, in Republika Srpska. As of 1992 the&#13;
gas supply network consisted of 190 km of transmission mains and offtake pipes, running&#13;
from Zvornik to the Sarajevo area via Semizovac and from the latter to Zenica.&#13;
Consumption peaked in 1990 with 610 million cubic meters, constituting 8% of the total&#13;
energy consumption in BH. Within Sarajevo, there were 15,000 household connections&#13;
and all major boilers of the city's district heating network had been converted from coal to&#13;
gas-firing. Gas imports for BH are metered at the Ukraine/Hungarian border (Beregov,&#13;
the contractual point of delivery of the gas) and from there they are transported through&#13;
the Hungarian and Serb transmission systems to Zvornik. The cost of transporting the gas&#13;
from Beregov to BH is equivalent to about 35% of the contracted gas volume. The gas&#13;
was imported under a contract between Energopetrol, a state-owned oil and gas company,&#13;
and Gazexport, the export branch of Russia's Gazprom. Within BH, gas transmission and&#13;
distribution was (and is) the responsibility of Sarajevogas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
3.    Current Situation. At the beginning of the war gas supply coming into Sarajevo&#13;
was reduced to such an extent that gas use for industry and much of the district heating&#13;
became impossible. With the additional destruction of part of the district heating system&#13;
in Sarajevo early on and given a sharp reduction of electricity generation in BH, gas&#13;
suddenly assumed major importance for the inhabitants of Sarajevo as a means to stay&#13;
warm and to cook. Many improvised connections and appliances were made, which has&#13;
often led to explosions and highly inefficient gas use. As of the end of 1995, the total&#13;
number of household connections in all of Sarajevo was estimated at around 85,000. Gas&#13;
consumption now constitutes about 70% of all energy consumption in Sarajevo and it is&#13;
the basic heating and cooking fuel for the city's remaining 300,000 inhabitants.&#13;
4.    Debt to Gazexport. While the gas supply from Semizovac to Zenica (the entire&#13;
western branch of the transmission system, affecting several major industries along that&#13;
line) was shut off during the war. some gas was allowed to come into Sarajevo. In&#13;
exchange, gas was allowed to go to Belgrade and to the Bosnian Serbs. The total debt for&#13;
gas supplied by Gazexport was US$105 million as of October 12, 1995. Of this total,&#13;
GBH claims that only about 30% is owed by it for the supply of gas to the Bosnian part of&#13;
Sarajevo. The new agreement signed between Gazexport and Energopetrol calls for&#13;
delivery at Beregov of specified quantities of gas for both the Federation and the&#13;
Republika Srpska at US$80 per 1,000 m3. Since then, most supplies have been paid for&#13;
and efforts are underway to come to a permanent solution for full payment of current gas&#13;
consumption.&#13;
5.    Sector Strategy. The proposed sector strategy would be to: (i) seek partial donor&#13;
funding for the next three years of gas consumption; (ii) reconfigure the gas network and&#13;
restore safe service to acceptable levels; (iii) ensure demand management through&#13;
disconnection of consumers that can be reconnected to the district heating system,&#13;
introduction of energy efficient appliances, and cost recovery, (iv) strengthen the sector&#13;
enticy; and (v) settle past debts to Gazexport. An Emergency Gas System Project is&#13;
expected to be presented to the Board in FY97.&#13;
C. DISTRICT HEATING&#13;
6.    Background. In 1991 BH had district heating (DH) systems in most major towns&#13;
and cities with a population in excess of about 25,000 inhabitants. The systems were&#13;
generally run by municipally-owned district heating enterprises (DHEs). Cogeneration&#13;
was provided only by the combined heat and power plants in Tuzla and Kakanj as well as&#13;
by local industries; the remaining heat was generated by local heat-only boilers. Already&#13;
prior to the war, some efforts had been made to start converting coal-fired boilers to gas&#13;
or oil firing, notably in Sarajevo. DH systems throughout BH served 120,000 customers,&#13;
equivalent to 450,000 inhabitants or 10% of the total population. The Sarajevo DH&#13;
system was the country's largest, serving about 180,000 inhabitants or 45% of the&#13;
population of Sarajevo. All DH systems delivered mostly heat only and provided domestic&#13;
hot water only to a small percentage of consumers. Heat prices were set locally and were&#13;
not uniform nationwide. Subsidies for heat and hot water consumption were provided&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
based on income level from local tax proceeds.  The average subsidy was US$100 per&#13;
annum, compared to an average annual heat bill of about US$370 per consumer.&#13;
7.    Current Situation. Currently, the DH systems in Sarajevo, Banja Luka, Bihac&#13;
and Mostar are only partly operational. In Sarajevo the system has been damaged due to&#13;
shelling and freezing of the pipes in the network; building internal heating installations in&#13;
residential dwellings (pipes, radiators and valves) have incurred substantial damage, also&#13;
due to the rusting associated with non-usage of the system. In Banja Luka most of the&#13;
damage is related to non-usage of the system due to lack of fuel, and associated rusting&#13;
and freezing. In all cities, lack of maintenance due to the absence of spare parts has been&#13;
significant and further aggravated the problems.&#13;
8.    Sector Strategy. The proposed sector strategy would be to: (i) restore urban&#13;
district heating services to adequate levels as soon as possible, disconnect previously&#13;
serviced flats from the gas system (in Sarajevo) and reduce fuel wood consumption (in&#13;
Banja Luka); (ii) rehabilitate building internal heating installations; (iii) strengthen sector&#13;
institutions and increase cost recovery; and (iv) undertake master plan studies to prepare&#13;
plans for the optimal configuration of each city's future heating system. An Emergency&#13;
District Heating Reconstruction Project was approved by the Board of Directors on May&#13;
14, 1996.&#13;
D. ELECTRIC POWER&#13;
9.    Background. In 1990 BH produced 13,090 Gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity&#13;
from generating plants located on its territory. Electricity consumption was 11,181 GWh.&#13;
The system comprised 13 hydro power plants with a total capacity of 2,034 Megawatt&#13;
(MW) and an average output of 6,922 GWh/year, and 12 thermal power plants with a&#13;
total capacity of 1,957 Megawatt (MW) and an output of 10,675 GWh in 1990. The&#13;
thermal power plants were coal and lignite fired, with the fuel coming from mines within&#13;
BH. EPBiH was responsible for operating its own system and meeting local demand.&#13;
However, being part of the former Yugoslav network, the 400 kV power grid in BH was&#13;
controlled by JUGEL's dispatching center in Belgrade. Power exchanges with neighboring&#13;
countries were also controlled by JUGEL.&#13;
10.   The BH power system was operated by Elektroprivreda Bosne i Hercegovine&#13;
(EPBiH) and consists of generation, transmission and distribution facilities interconnected&#13;
and operated at 400, 220, 110, 35, 20, 10 and 0.4 kV voltage levels. Transmission&#13;
voltages are 110 kV and higher; distribution voltages are 35 kV and lower. Total length&#13;
of the transmission lines was about 5,400 km and of the distribution lines 92,000 km.&#13;
Transmission and distribution transformer capacity was about 15,300 MVA.  The&#13;
backbone of the interconnected transmission system is a 400 kV network (with a&#13;
transmission line length of about 800 km and with 8 substations), which is interconnected&#13;
with Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia. The 400 kV transmission line section of Trebinje-&#13;
Gacko-Mostar forms part of the southern main line interconnecting the member countries&#13;
of SUDEL (Austria, Italy, Greece, Former Yugoslavia) and UCPTE.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11.   Current Situation. War damage to the BH power system started in 1991 with&#13;
destruction of transmission facilities and interconnection lines to neighboring countries and&#13;
UCPTE and thereafter spread to large parts of the generation, transmission and&#13;
distribution systems. A description of the damage follows:&#13;
Generation: Installed capacity in the Federation area was 2,574 MW (or 65% of&#13;
the total installed capacity in BiH) and 49% of its generating capacity is currently&#13;
damaged. The following hydropower plants on the Neretva River are damaged or&#13;
out of operation for other reasons: Jablanica (6x25 MW); Grabovica (2x57 MW);&#13;
Salakovac (3x70 MW); Mostar (3x25 MW); and the Rama plant on the Rama river&#13;
(2x80 MW). The Tuzla (779 MW) and Kakanj (578 MW) thermal power plants&#13;
also suffered extensive damage. The condition of the hydro power plants on the&#13;
Trebisnjica River (2x54 MW, lx60 MW, 2 x 215 MW, and lx8 MW) and on the&#13;
Drina River (3x105 MW), and the Ugljevik (1x300 MW) and Gracko (1x300&#13;
MW) thermal power plants has seriously deteriorated due to lack of maintenance&#13;
as a result of the war. In 1994, generation of the major power plants in the&#13;
Federation area was only 1,744 GWh (41% of the total generation in BiH).&#13;
Transmission: About 60% of the transmission network and control system are&#13;
seriously damaged.  Many transformer stations, including all eight 400 kV&#13;
transformer substations, civil works, telecommunications and maintenance&#13;
equipment are seriously damaged or destroyed. The interconnection with SUIDEL&#13;
and UCPTE has been interrupted, as well as the connection of Greece with&#13;
SUDEL through the 400 kV line through Mostar.&#13;
Distribution: The distribution network is largely destroyed. During the first half&#13;
of 1994 residential consumers in the Federation area received only 4-6 hours of&#13;
electricity per day. The Government introduced rationing of electricity in 1995.&#13;
Residential consumers were allowed a maximum of 180 kWh/month/household in&#13;
May 1995.&#13;
12.   Sector Strategy. The proposed sector strategy would be to: (i) restore service to&#13;
acceptable levels; (ii) reconfigure the electric power network to optimize the system,&#13;
taking into account BH's need for significant independence from the SFRY's network and&#13;
its security of supply, (iii) improve sector finances by improving billing and collections and&#13;
gradually revising the tariff structure and levels to reflect supply costs for each category of&#13;
consumers; and (iv) restructure the sector by introducing a sector structure and regulatory&#13;
framework that would facilitate attracting potential investors&#13;
E. COAL&#13;
13.   Background. In the 1980's the coal rnines in BH produced annually about 18&#13;
million tons of coal, of which 10 rnillion tons of brown coal and 8 million tons of lignite.&#13;
Their brown coal output accounted for about 80% of total SFRY production, lignite for&#13;
only 15%. Production was concentrated in areas near Tuzla and Zenica in both open pit&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
as well as underground mines. In addition, two mines in the Republika Srpska were&#13;
important: Ugljevik (brown coal) and Gracko (lignite). About half of the production&#13;
originated from surface mines and the other half from underground mines. BH's proven&#13;
reserves of coal are about 1.6 billion tons. More than 80% of BH's total production was&#13;
used for electric power generation and the remaining 20% for industrial and household&#13;
uses.&#13;
14.   Current Situation. Coal production dropped to 1.5 million tons in 1994, i.e. less&#13;
than 10% of the pre-war level. The coal mines in the Federation have been grouped into&#13;
two principal companies: the Tuzla Coal Mines and the Central Bosnia Coal Mines, which&#13;
supply thermal power plants. The Ugljevik Coal Mine is an important and relatively&#13;
modern surface mine in Republika Srpska. Much of the mobile mining equipment has&#13;
been cannibalized beyond repair. Some newer mobile equipment had to be turned over to&#13;
the army or just disappeared. There is an acute lack of critical materials such as fuel, tires&#13;
and spare parts.&#13;
15.   Despite the drastic drop in production, no efforts were made to concentrate&#13;
production in a few large and economic mines. The number of people employed has&#13;
decreased from 26,000 to about 7,000. Since production declined much faster,&#13;
productivity is now among the lowest in the world. Present production costs appear to be&#13;
at or above the world market level of coal prices adjusted for quality and are higher than&#13;
sales prices, which are set by the State. To ensure future financial viability, coal mining&#13;
enterprises need to close uneconomic capacity.&#13;
16.   Sector Strategy. The proposed sector strategy would be to: (i) determine priority&#13;
actions for the lowest cost mines whose output is competitive with imports; (ii) restore&#13;
output of the lowest-cost mines to minimum acceptable levels (para 24 (j)); and (iii)&#13;
restructure the coal industry, including closing uneconomic mining capacity and&#13;
privatizing services and the most efficient mines wherever possible&#13;
I. BANK RESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
17.   The conclusion of the Dayton-Paris Peace Agreement in December 1995 ended&#13;
Europe's most destructive war in the last fifty years. The war has shattered the economy&#13;
and brought productive activity almost to a standstill. The country's pre-war GDP of&#13;
about US$9 billion has shrunk to about US$2 billion, and its per-capita GDP declined&#13;
from about US$1900 to about US$500. The majority of the 900,000 workers employed in&#13;
1991 are currently still unemployed. Wages and salariesare low. Pensions are paid but at&#13;
low levels. Many people still receive some form of humanitarian assistance. At least 200-&#13;
250,000 people are dead or missing, and over 1 million people left the country. In&#13;
addition, there are about 1.5 million displaced people in the country, many of whom live in&#13;
temporary shelters.  Enormous damage has been inflicted on the country's physical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
infrastructure, including energy. Direct war damages are huge, probably in the range of&#13;
US$15-20 billion. Indirect damage due to lack of maintenance and corrosion accounts for&#13;
many more billions of dollars of losses.&#13;
A. SECTOR RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAM&#13;
18.   A reconstruction and rehabilitation program for the combined energy sectors of&#13;
BH  of about US$900 million has been prepared as part of the US$5.1 billion&#13;
reconstruction program for all sectors, over 3-4 years, which the Bank has helped to&#13;
develop in a joint effort with the country and the donor community. The energy sector&#13;
program calls for a major effort to restore destroyed, damaged and forcibly neglected&#13;
equipment and to bring service back as soon as possible to near pre-war levels. The&#13;
proposed project will be the second major element in this program, following the&#13;
Emergency District Heating Reconstruction Project (Credit TF 024034 of US$20 million;&#13;
May 1996). It aims to ensure restoration of reliable and continuous electricity supply to a&#13;
number of major cities and industries. The financing of some urgently needed equipment&#13;
for the power sector is already included under the Bank's Emergency Recovery Project.&#13;
19.   A third emergency project in the energy sector planned for FY97 is the Emergency&#13;
Gas System Reconstruction Project, which focuses mostly on Sarajevo. Projects with a&#13;
medium term perspective would deal with further reconstruction and rehabilitation of the&#13;
various energy sectors and would address broader policy issues such as the sector's&#13;
regulatory framework, energy pricing, sector restructuring, and eventual privatization in&#13;
more detail.&#13;
B. WORLD BANK STRATEGY AND PROGRAMS IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA&#13;
20.   On April 1, 1996 BH fulfilled the conditions of succession to the Socialist Federal&#13;
Republic of Yugoslavia's membership in the Bank, IDA and IFC.  Membership is&#13;
retroactive to February 25, 1993.&#13;
21.   Since early 1995, the Bank Group has been deeply involved in developing a donor-&#13;
funded reconstruction program for BH. A joint mission of the Bank, IMF, EU and EBRD&#13;
in late 1995 resulted in the proposed Priority Reconstruction Program which was first&#13;
presented to a donors' meeting, co-sponsored by the Bank and the EU in Brussels, a week&#13;
after the signing of the Paris/Dayton Peace Agreement. This meeting led to donor&#13;
commitments of about US$600 million for immediate reconstruction activities. A second&#13;
donors' conference, again co-chaired by the Bank and the EU, was held in mid-April, 1996&#13;
and resulted in additional donor pledges in the order of US$1.2 billion for financing&#13;
priority reconstruction activities during 1996.&#13;
22.   The Bank has been following a two-track assistance strategy, which seeks to&#13;
leverage its limited resources with significant resource transfer from donors. First, before&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
arrears resolution, the Bank supported selected immediate assistance programs through a&#13;
special Trust Fund for Reconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina (TFBH) which is&#13;
providing US$125 million on concessional terms equivalent to those offered by IDA, as&#13;
well as an additional US$25 million in grant funds.  Seven emergency operations,&#13;
committing the entire US$150 million, have been approved under the TFBH: an&#13;
Emergency Recovery Project; a Water, Sanitation, and Solid Waste Urgent Works&#13;
Project; an Emergency Farm Reconstruction Project; an Emergency Transport Project; an&#13;
Emergency District Heating Reconstruction Project; an Emergency Education&#13;
Reconstruction Project and a War Victims Rehabilitation Project. Second, following&#13;
arrears resolution (which was made possible by the effectiveness of the Consolidation&#13;
Loan package on June 14, 1996), while the Bank will continue to focus on supporting the&#13;
implementation of the reconstruction program, its assistance program will be broadened to&#13;
include support for the initial phase of the Government's macroeconomic and institutional&#13;
reforms.  In the area of reconstruction, Bank assistance will focus on employment&#13;
generation and housing, both needed to facilitate the reintegration of demobilized soldiers&#13;
and the return of refugees, as well as on continued support for the rehabilitation of&#13;
infrastructure and clearance of landmines.&#13;
III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
23.   The objectives of the project would be to: (i) restore electricity service to&#13;
acceptable levels in major cities and for vital industries. Initial reconstruction would target&#13;
mainly critical power plants (including notably cogeneration plants), principal substations&#13;
and major transmission lines; (ii) increase coal production in the most efficient mines to&#13;
supply the fuel necessary for the cogeneration and power-only thermal plants; (iii)&#13;
reconfigure the electric power network, taking into account BH's need for significant&#13;
independence from Belgrade and security of electricity supply, (iv) enhance the sector's&#13;
institutional capacity and improve its finances; and (v) support sector restructuring. In&#13;
addition, the project would establish a procurement monitoring and audit unit for all&#13;
Bank/IDA financed, cofinanced or administered projects.&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
24.   The proposed project has electric power generation, transmission and distribution&#13;
components, an associated coal mining component and, in addition, a procurement&#13;
monitoring and audit unit component. The electric power component of the project is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
described in detail in Attachment I and would consist of components (a) through (i) as&#13;
follows:&#13;
a) Rehabilitation of Hydro Power Stations. Rehabilitation and maintenance of&#13;
hydro plant at:  (i) Jablanica (4x25 MW); (ii) Grabovica (2x57 MW); (iii)&#13;
Mostar (3x25 MW); and (iv) Jajce I (2x25 MW). The project would restore the&#13;
plants to normal operating condition;&#13;
b) Rehabilitation of Thermal Power Stations. Rehabilitation and maintenance of:&#13;
(i) the Tuzla cogeneration plant (IxlOO MW); (ii) the Kakanj cogeneration plant&#13;
(2xl 10 MW); and (iii) the Ugljevik power station (1x300 NW). The project&#13;
would restore the units to provide reliable continuous service for up to another&#13;
seven to eight years,&#13;
c) Reconstruction of Transmission Lines and Substations. Reconstruction of about&#13;
350 km of 220 kV and 110 kV transmission lines, and thirty one 220/110/35 kV&#13;
and 110/35/10 kV substations needed for rebuilding the damaged power supply&#13;
system, restoring power supply to the cut-off areas, and improving the reliability&#13;
of supply for Sarajevo, Tuzla, Zenica, Mostar, Gorazde, Foca, Banja Luka,&#13;
Bihac and their environs;&#13;
d) Reconstruction of Distribution Networks. This would cover the most urgent&#13;
reconstruction needs of the distribution networks in the districts of Sarajevo,&#13;
Tuzla, Zenica, Mostar, Doboj, Bihac, Grahovo, G. Vakuf, Maglaj, Banja Luka,&#13;
Bijeljina, Pale, Trebinje, Gorazde, Foca, Kopaci, Glamoc and Jajce;&#13;
e) Repair of Communication and System Control. The system control and&#13;
communication system has been extensively damaged. To retain control of the&#13;
power system, the microwave link Sarajevo-Kakanj and the Sarajevo Load&#13;
Dispatch Center have to be urgently repaired,&#13;
f) Purchase of Service Vehicles. Most of EPBiH's service vehicles were damaged&#13;
during the war. The project would supply vehicles for generation, transmission&#13;
and distributions maintenance, and for billing and collection services;&#13;
g) Purchase of Spare Parts.  The spare parts to be ordered are primarily for&#13;
maintenance of existing generation plants and for the transmission and&#13;
distribution systems. This includes the reestablishment of sufficient stock levels&#13;
with a minimum inventory level of two years at the time of project completion;&#13;
h) Technical Assistance comprises engineering and consultants services as follows:&#13;
(i) engineering services for preparation of bidding documents, technical&#13;
approvals of vender offers, drawings and designs, construction supervision,&#13;
inspection and expediting, and general assistance to the electric utilities in&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina. It will comprise international power experts' services&#13;
and a large number of man-months of local engineering consultants' services&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
over a period of 24 months; and (ii) consultants' services to prepare a sector&#13;
restructuring study (para 27), a tariff study and a least cost investment plan;&#13;
i) Project Management Support. A project management support component is&#13;
included for partial repair of office facilities and the supply of basic office&#13;
equipment for the Project Implementation Unit of EPBiH;&#13;
j) Associated Coal Mines. The emergency rehabilitation of selected economically&#13;
viable coal mines (the Dubrave, Sikylje and Banovici surface mines, and the&#13;
Mramor underground mine of the Tuzla Mining Company, the Vrtliste surface&#13;
mine and Breza underground mine at Kakanj of the Central Bosnia Mining&#13;
Company, and the Ugljevik surface mine at Ugljevik) focuses on meeting the&#13;
coal supply needs of the Tuzla, Kakanj and Ugljevik thermal power plants. To&#13;
meet the power plants' requirements, urgent rehabilitation of these specific coal&#13;
mines is required. The rehabilitation would mainly consist of: (i) supply of&#13;
consumable materials, such as tires, conveyor belts, cable and spare parts for the&#13;
existing equipment; (ii) replacement of key smaller equipment damaged beyond&#13;
repair, but crucial to operation and maintenance; (iii) overhaul of major&#13;
production equipment; and (iv) provision of consultants' services to assist the&#13;
Government in preparing a coal sector restructuring program (Attachment 2.1);&#13;
and&#13;
k) Procurement Monitoring and Audit Unit. To optimize the benefits of the&#13;
ongoing Emergency Reconstruction Program and to promote mobilization of&#13;
additional resources from abroad, the objectives of efficiency and economy&#13;
should be adhered to at all times. This objective would be achieved by the&#13;
creation of a Procurement Monitoring and Auditing Unit (PMAU) that ensures&#13;
transparency of procurement process in all Government-executed projects,&#13;
regardless of the source of their financing. The Government is expected to&#13;
establish formally such a PMAU not later than October 31,1996.&#13;
25.   Because of the urgency of  establishing an effective and well functioning&#13;
procurement monitoring and auditing system as soon as possible, an interim arrangement&#13;
for one year, starting September 1, 1996 would entrust this function to an experienced and&#13;
reputable international firm. During the first year the PMAU consultants would: (a)&#13;
monitor at least one full cycle of procurement and disbursement transactions carried-out&#13;
by each executing agency (PIU) for Bank/IDA financed or administered projects. The&#13;
selection of the transactions at their different stages of processing would be made&#13;
randomly. Monitoring of additional contracts or steps of processing for the same project&#13;
will be necessary only in cases of observed important deficiencies in procurement&#13;
practices; (b) carry out ex-post annual procurement audits for all projects financed by the&#13;
Bank up to September 1, 1996; (c) prepare specific audits as requested by Government or&#13;
by the Bank as needed; (d) submit findings according to a pre-agreed time table to the&#13;
head of the executing agency, the government and the Bank for all the audits referred to&#13;
above and according to a pre-agreed schedule, including recommendations for&#13;
improvements or adjustments; (e) design a monitoring and auditing system with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
appropriate policies and procedures to be applied to all Government financed projects in&#13;
Bosnia and Herzegovina; and (f) provide necessary training to a core staff to take over the&#13;
full procurement auditing function by September 1997 (Attachment 2.2).&#13;
C. SECTOR RESTRUCTURING&#13;
26.   There are today, de facto, three entities in the power sector in BH: (i) EPBiH; (ii)&#13;
Elektroprivreda Herzeg-Bosna, operating in the Croat areas of the Federation and which is&#13;
not integrated with the Croatian power entity; and (iii) Elektroprivreda Republika Srpska,&#13;
operating in the Republika Srpska and which exchanges power with Serbia. Because the&#13;
core of the BH electricity system (almost 50% of all installed capacity, containing both&#13;
hydro as well as thermal power plants) is managed by EPBiH, IDA would focus its&#13;
funding on the EPBiH-managed part of the system, while the EU, the EBRD and some&#13;
other donors would primarily focus on distribution and generation in BH.&#13;
27.   While the power system may be too small to enable effective competition,&#13;
measures can and should be taken to introduce a sector structure that would facilitate&#13;
attracting potential investors as follows:&#13;
a) In a first stage, generation could be separated from transmission and distribution&#13;
and broken down in several generating companies, each operating on a&#13;
commercial basis; the transmission system could be unified under a single&#13;
authority to ensure the optimization of power transmission and permit effective&#13;
power trading as well as system stabilization. Distribution enterprises could be&#13;
organized on a local basis. As part of a proposed power sector restructuring&#13;
study an Energy Law should be prepared (and eventually passed), under which a&#13;
Regulatory Authority should be set up to regulate power prices and to ensure&#13;
third party access to the transmission system.&#13;
b) In a second stage, once the Regulatory Authority has been established and&#13;
operates with reasonable autonomy, the generation and distribution companies&#13;
could be partially or totally privatized. The transmission entity could eventually&#13;
be considered for privatization after the new ownership arrangements in the&#13;
generation and distribution segments have stabilized. Regardless of whether or&#13;
not the transmission entity is privatized, the Energy Law should allow for third&#13;
party access. Consultants services will be provided under the proposed project&#13;
to assist in carrying out the electricity sector restructuring study.&#13;
D. COST ESTIMATE&#13;
28.   The estimated total project cost, including physical contingencies of 10%, is&#13;
US$196 million equivalent, of which US$180 million for power and US$16 million for&#13;
associated coal mines. The foreign exchange cost is US$180 million (or 92% of the total)&#13;
and the local cost is about US$16 million equivalent. Project components for generation,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- I1 -&#13;
transmission, distribution and general plant facilities were defined based on detailed war&#13;
damage assessments, reconstruction studies, and engineering designs carried out by&#13;
EPBiH, Elektroprivreda Herzeg Bosna, Elektroprivreda Republika Srpska, their local&#13;
consultants, and by the coal mining companies. The cost estimates reflect end-1995 prices&#13;
and are based on the latest international tendering information available for similar works.&#13;
They exclude customs duties and taxes, which are expected to be waived for this&#13;
emergency project. The cost estimates for the proposed project are summarized in Table&#13;
1. Detailed estimates of project cost and estimated annual project expenditures are&#13;
provided in Attachments 3 and 4.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
E. FINANCING PLAN&#13;
29.   The financing plan is shown in Attachment 5. Of the total cost of US$196 million&#13;
equivalent, IDA would provide US$35 million to finance reconstruction of the Grabovica&#13;
hydro power plant and the Tuzla cogeneration plant and associated coal mines,&#13;
transmission substations, spare parts, and project management in the Federation area. The&#13;
US$30 million amount for electric power includes a US$3.8 million district heating&#13;
component covering goods and works for the Emergency District Heating Reconstruction&#13;
Project (TF024034), which is intended to offset the US$3.8 million Project Start-up&#13;
Advance for the proposed Project that was made available under the District Heating&#13;
Project (para 38). The IDA credit would meet about 18% of the total project cost. The&#13;
EU would finance primarily reconstruction of transmission lines and distribution networks.&#13;
The EBRD would mainly finance communication and system control and spare parts. The&#13;
UK, USA, France, Austria, the Netherlands and Ireland would finance primarily&#13;
distribution networks. Switzerland would finance reconstruction of the Jablanica hydro&#13;
power plant. Belgium would supply and install part of the transmission substation&#13;
equipment. In addition, Norway and other donors would finance international expert&#13;
services to assist in engineering and project implementation. Other donors, such as Japan,&#13;
the Czech Republic, and the Central European Initiative (CEI) would also contribute to&#13;
various project components. Commitments for financing are based on the results of May&#13;
20-22, 1996 Infrastructure Technical Meeting with donors held in Paris. A financing gap&#13;
of about US$63.0 million (or 32% of the total project cost) still remains. In the event&#13;
such additional financing cannot be mobilized by the end of 1996, the project scope would&#13;
be adjusted by reducing or eliminating investments in: (i) the Mostar hydro power station&#13;
(which requires much more preparatory work before reconstruction can start); and (ii) the&#13;
Kakanj thermal power plant and associated coal mine components and deferring these&#13;
investments to a possible follow-up project.&#13;
F. PROCUREMENT&#13;
30.   All procurement of equipment and materials financed by IDA will be in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under Emergency Projects for BH as&#13;
approved by the Ad Hoc Committee on January 4, 1996. Contracts estimated to cost&#13;
more than US$5 million each would be awarded, to the extent possible, through simplified&#13;
International Competitive Bidding (ICB), and for contracts estimated to cost between&#13;
US$2 million and up to US$5 million each, Limited International Bidding (LIB) will be&#13;
used. The aggregate value for ICB is about US$8.3 million (or 24 percent of the total&#13;
credit), and the aggregate value for LIB is about US$2.9 million (or 8 percent of the&#13;
credit). Standard documents for procurement of goods will be used.&#13;
31.   Given the need for quick project implementation and because of the proprietary&#13;
nature of much of the equipment needed, the bulk of the equipment for the proposed&#13;
project would be procured through International Shopping (IS), and Direct Contracting&#13;
(DC). IS will be used for procuring equipment and materials or standard specification&#13;
commodities, estimated to cost between US$200,000 and US$2 million per contract up to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
an aggregate amount of US$5.5 million (or 16 percent of the total credit). IS is based on&#13;
comparison of price quotations obtained from at least three suppliers in two countries.&#13;
Direct Contracting (DC) will be used for proprietary items, for reasons of compatibility&#13;
and standardization, which would include contracts for: (i) equipment proprietary to&#13;
process design; (ii) equipment requiring compatibility with existing units; and (iii) where&#13;
replacement of power plant or substations components would be required, to assure&#13;
adequate fit with existing equipment and/or to meet dimensional clearance restrictions.&#13;
The aggregate value for DC is about US$12.5 million (or 35 percent of the total credit).&#13;
The list of spare parts to be procured, as well as the procurement method of direct&#13;
contracting, should be reviewed and approved by IDA. Advance contracting using both a&#13;
Project Start Up Advance as well as retroactive financing is being carried out (para 38).&#13;
32.   National Competitive Bidding (NCB) will be used for the Grabovica tailrace&#13;
reconstruction civil works with an amount not to exceed US$3 million (or 9 percent of the&#13;
total credit). Simplified National Competitive Bidding (SNCB) will be used for minor&#13;
works for the rehabilitation of EPBiH's office space with an amount not to exceed US$1&#13;
million (or 3 percent of the total credit). SNCB contracts are awarded on the basis of&#13;
quotations obtained from three qualified national contractors in response to a written&#13;
invitation. National Shopping (NS) will be used for supply of basic office equipment and&#13;
furniture for the rehabilitation of EPBIH's office facilities, with an amount not to exceed&#13;
US$0.3 million (or 1 percent of the total credit). There are two qualified local consulting&#13;
firms which have the capability to carry out detailed design, procurement, construction&#13;
supervision and project management. Both firms were shortlisted and one (Electroforce)&#13;
has been competitively selected to provide consultancy services following the Bank's&#13;
guidelines. Assuming that the cofinancing will be tied, those funds should generally be&#13;
provided through turn-key contracts, which are faster disbursing and easier to monitor&#13;
than other arrangements. Turn-key contractors should be encouraged to use local labor as&#13;
much as possible, because local labor capable of doing the job is cheaper and because it&#13;
would provide much needed local employment opportunities.   The procurement&#13;
arrangements are summarized in Table 2. A detailed procurement plan and schedule are&#13;
shown in Attachment 6. 1.&#13;
G. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
33.         Power. The three Elektropfivredas would manage and implement the&#13;
project components in their respective service areas. Management of the IDA-financed&#13;
part of the project would be carried out by EPBiH, which would be responsible for&#13;
implementation, including procurement and disbursement of funds. It has the organization&#13;
and key staff required for project management. Nevertheless, to facilitate effective project&#13;
implementation on an emergency timetable, EPBiH will establish a Project Implementation&#13;
Unit (PIU), directed by the Head of Development reporting to EPBiH Management, to&#13;
carry out the reconstruction activities. The PIU would consist of Deputy Task Managers&#13;
for Hydro Power, Thermal Power, Transmission, Distribution, and Procurement and&#13;
Logistics (each assisted by a full-time coordinator responsible for day-to-day&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
implementation), and charged with coordinating, supervising and monitoring the execution&#13;
of their part of the project. A local consulting firm (Electroforce), which is able to carry&#13;
out most of the engineering services required for the generation and transmission works,&#13;
has been appointed to assist EPBiH in carrying out engineering, procurement, and project&#13;
implementation. The PIU will be assisted by international power experts. These power&#13;
experts will assist in reviewing procurement documents, coordination and supervision of&#13;
this reconstruction effort, harmonization of designs and standards, and efficient use of&#13;
resources. The PIU is also in charge of coordinating, supervising, and monitoring the&#13;
execution of the power component under the Emergency Recovery Project.&#13;

34.   EPBiH will ensure that PIU-related activities and independent functions within the&#13;
EPBiH organization are effectively integrated. While the PIU exercises control over all&#13;
project-related activities, it would receive cross support from other EPBiH units in&#13;
selected areas, such as procurement, technical support, legal matters, budgeting,&#13;
accounting, disbursement and cost control, scheduling, manpower allocation, and&#13;
operational support. The implementation of the sub-projects would be the primary&#13;
responsibility of the local generation and transmission entities, who will report to the PIU.&#13;
Replacement of transmission equipment in operation would be performed by the&#13;
transmission entities' own maintenance staff on force account, who have handled&#13;
satisfactorily similar work during the past few months. Installation of major equipment&#13;
would be done in most instances by the suppliers on a turn-key basis, using local&#13;
construction capacity as much as possible.&#13;
35.   Coal Mining. The Tuzla, Central Bosnia and Ugljevik coal mining companies will&#13;
be responsible for physical implementation of the associated coal mine rehabilitation&#13;
components.  A project manager will be appointed for each company.  Physical&#13;
implementation will be assisted by highly skilled technicians from the manufacturers of&#13;
existing equipment. International coal experts will provide procurement assistance and&#13;
logistical support and facilitate coordination between the mining companies and the&#13;
donors. The Ministry of Energy and Industry will be responsible for contracting the&#13;
technical assistance services for the sector restructuring study.&#13;
36.   The organization charts for project implementation and the implementation&#13;
schedules for the various components of the project are set out in Attachments 6.2 and&#13;
6.3.  Similar organizations for project implementation will also be established by&#13;
Elektroprivreda Herzeg Bosnia and Elektroprivreda Reupblika Srpska for implementation&#13;
of project components in their respective areas.&#13;
H. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
37.   The IDA Credit would be disbursed against: (a) 100 percent of the expenditures&#13;
for directly imported equipment, materials and services quoted on CIF basis; (b) 100&#13;
percent of local expenditures (ex-factory cost and other items procured locally) net of&#13;
taxes; (c) 100 percent of civil works net of taxes; and (d) 100 percent of expenditures for&#13;
consulting services. For expenditures pertaining to all civil works contracts, for contracts&#13;
for goods worth less than US$1 million and for consultants' services worth less than&#13;
$300,000 (except for individual consultant contracts for which the threshold would be&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent) disbursements would be made on the basis of statements of&#13;
expenditures. Documentation supporting such expenditures would be retained in EPBiH's&#13;
and RUT's offices and made available for review by IDA supervision missions. To&#13;
facilitate disbui sement under this project, four Special Accounts (one each for the&#13;
Government, EPBiH, RUT and for the District Heating component) in US dollars will be&#13;
established in the name of the Ministry of Finance in a commercial bank, to be maintained&#13;
and operated under conditions acceptable to IDA. The authorization allocation of the&#13;
Special Accounts will be limited to US$6.0 million equivalent (US$0.5, US$3.5, US$1.0,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
and US$1.0 million, respectively), representing about four months (average) of IDA's&#13;
share of estimated expenditures expected to be paid from the Special Accounts.&#13;
Replenishment applications should be submitted monthly, and must include reconciled&#13;
bank statements, as well as other appropriate documents.&#13;
38.   Attachment 7 presents the disbursement schedule for the proposed IDA Credit.&#13;
IDA's standard disbursement profile would not be observed since this is a two-year&#13;
emergency project; most of the contracts would be placed in 1996 and early 1997 and&#13;
delivery would be completed in 1997. A US$3.8 million Project Start-up Advance (PSA)&#13;
for this project as well as a PSA for the proposed Emergency District Heating&#13;
Reconstruction Project (US$5.3 million) and for the proposed Emergency Gas System&#13;
Reconstruction Project (US$6.0 million) were approved by the Board of Executive&#13;
Directors on March 27, 1996. The PSA has been applied to project preparation and start-&#13;
up activities. PSAs for this and the other two projects were necessary because no other&#13;
funds were available to launch reconstruction operations. The PSAs are advanced against&#13;
the Emergency District Heating Reconstruction Project's US$20 million Credit from the&#13;
TFBH. To ensure that the full US$20 million will be available for district heating, the&#13;
proposed Emergency Electric Power Reconstruction Project and the Emergency Gas&#13;
System Reconstruction Project will contain components for the Emergency District&#13;
Heating Reconstruction Project and, after Board approval and effectiveness, these&#13;
components will be financed from the Credits for these projects. In addition to the PSA,&#13;
IDA would provide retroactive financing of up to 10% of its credit amount (US$3.5&#13;
million) for advance procurement, because the Power Project's PSA was significantly&#13;
smaller than the PSAs provided for the District Heating and the Gas projects. The credit&#13;
would be disbursed over a period of about two and a half years. The project completion&#13;
date would be June 30, 1998, and the closing date would be December 31, 1998.&#13;
1. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
39.   In accordance with OD 4.01 this project has been rated environmental "Category&#13;
B." This category is reserved for projects which may have relatively mninor adverse&#13;
environmental impacts, despite the fact that the project would result in a net reduction in&#13;
air pollution. An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has been prepared with and&#13;
agreed to by EPBiH (Attachment 8). The project has been designed to include all&#13;
mitigation and monitoring recommended in the EMP. In general, the reconstruction&#13;
program will seek to improve the environmental impact of the components to be&#13;
reconstructed.&#13;
40.   Kakanj Cogeneration Plant.  The following are the principal environmental&#13;
concems in connection with the Kakanj plant:&#13;
Air Oualitv. The plant burns mostly brown coal with a 2% sulfur content. The&#13;
electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) are performing at an efficiency well below their&#13;
design level. They were designed to meet a standard of 500 mg/m and should be&#13;
rehabilitated to their original specified (design) performance capability. The S02&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
emissions could produce significant air quality impacts due to the poor quality&#13;
(combination of heating value, ash, and sulfur) of fuel from the Kakanj Mine and&#13;
the high terrain near the facility. To reduce S02 impacts the 4 x 32 MW units will&#13;
be phased-out after the year 2000. Another option to consider for the plant's&#13;
future rehabilitation for reducing S02 impacts may be to vent the 4 x 32 MW units&#13;
into the 300 meter stack to which the 2 x 110 MW units are currently connected.&#13;
Water Quality. A new wastewater treatment plant for this station is currently not&#13;
operating, and the completion and operation of this treatment plant should be&#13;
considered in the future.&#13;
Ash Disposal. Ash is transported by conveyor and dumped off a sheer cliff over a&#13;
drop of approximately 60 meters. No drinking water sources are near the ash&#13;
disposal site. The ash pile would be reclaimed (i.e., covered with soil/vegetation),&#13;
the drop height minimized and the ash wetted to reduce dusting.&#13;
Oil Storage Tanks. The station has three above ground oil storage tanks and two&#13;
underground tanks. Above ground tanks are surrounded by a berm and are&#13;
installed on a concrete pad. Since there are no sources of drinking water near the&#13;
underground tanks, the only required action should be to monitor the tanks for&#13;
leakage.&#13;
Fuel Handling and Storage. The coal is transported by truck to a crushing area at&#13;
the mine and is then transported by conveyor belt to the plant. The conveyor belts&#13;
are totally enclosed. Consideration should be given to reduce dusting from truck&#13;
transport of fuel (e.g., cover trucks, minimize material disposal heights).&#13;
41.   Tuzla Cogeneration Plant.  The following are the principal environmental&#13;
concerns in connection with the Tuzla Plant:&#13;
Air Quality. No maintenance or replacement of components in the ESPs has&#13;
occurred since the startup of these units in the early 1970s. They should be&#13;
rehabilitated to their original (design) performance.&#13;
Sulfur Dioxide. The plant burns mostly lignite with a 0.5% sulfur content. The&#13;
sulfur dioxide impacts caused by emissions from the station were evaluated since a&#13;
aerodynamic downwash situation had been identified and included in the mitigation&#13;
plan. An air quality impact analysis indicated that ambient levels of SO2 would be&#13;
more than 60 micrograms/Nm3 (annual average) higher and dust levels 32&#13;
micrograms/Nm3 (annual average) higher without the project, because people&#13;
would use the poor quality fuel in individual heaters rather than rely on the&#13;
cogeneration plant.&#13;
Water Quality. Water for plant use is supplied from a lake 10 kilometers from the&#13;
plant. Wastewaters are all discharged directly to the river without treatment.&#13;
Waste oil and plant lubricants are fed into the boilers as a disposal method.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
Wastewater streams from the station should be tested to determine the need for&#13;
water treatment facilities.&#13;
Ash Disposal. Ash is transported in a slurry to several disposal areas in the hills&#13;
approximately 5 kilometers away. No drinking water supply is near the disposal&#13;
areas.&#13;
Oil Storage Tanks. Above ground oil storage tanks are surrounded by berms and&#13;
are installed on an impervious pad. There are four underground oil storage tanks.&#13;
Since there are no sources of drinking water near the underground tanks, the only&#13;
required action should be to monitor the tanks for leakage.&#13;
Asbestos and PCBs. Asbestos is present on cooling tower plates and boiler house&#13;
insulation.  This material should be inspected for deterioration.  No Poly-&#13;
Chlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) are used in transformers at the station nor anywhere&#13;
in the system according to EPBiH.&#13;
Fuel Handling and Storage. Some minor dusting is likely from truck delivery of&#13;
fuel, storage of fuel, and fuel handling.  Simple control measures can be&#13;
implemented to reduce dusting (e.g., cover trucks and minimize drop height when&#13;
transferring fuel).&#13;
42.   Transmission Facilities. Transmission line corridors and substation sites were in&#13;
place before the war and their rehabilitation will not involve new routing or disturb new&#13;
areas. No new environmental impacts are anticipated.&#13;
43.   Hydroelectric Facilities. The Jablanica and Grabovica hydroelectric plants were&#13;
in service before the war and therefore no new environmental impacts will be caused by&#13;
their rehabilitation.&#13;
44.   Associated Coal Mines. Key environmental issues associated with the coal mines&#13;
rehabilitation are with utilization rather than with mining. In particular, the high sulfur and&#13;
ash content of brown coal is a concern for future development of thermal power and will&#13;
impact future mine development.   Concerning  surface coal mining, the major&#13;
environmental issue is use and disturbance of land. As mining will take place in existing&#13;
mnining areas, will not use and disturb additional land, and in view of the emergency&#13;
character of the project, no environmental mitigation measures other than prudent&#13;
engineering and operational practices are deemed necessary now. However, for any future&#13;
expansion of mining activities, appropriate approval and mitigation enforcement&#13;
procedures would need to be followed. Environmental acceptability will be an important&#13;
criterion for selection of a development strategy, and terms of reference for consulting&#13;
services to assist in coal sector restructuring (para 16) would include environmental&#13;
aspects as a component. Furthermore, as part of the technical assistance to be provided&#13;
for project implementation, advice would be obtained on the use of new mining equipment&#13;
in order to reduce potential environmental impacts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
J. AccouNTs, AUDITING AND REPORTING&#13;
45.   Separate and auditable accounts would be established by EPBiH and RUT. These&#13;
accounts would include: (i) a record of withdrawals on the IDA Credit with copies of all&#13;
disbursement requests and underlying documentation; and (ii) a record of transactions on&#13;
the Special Accounts and the copies of the bank statements on this account. Technical&#13;
assistance has been included under the project to establish proper accounts and financial&#13;
controlling procedures.&#13;
46.   The financial statements of the Beneficiaries and the project accounts would be&#13;
audited annually by independent auditors under terms of reference acceptable to IDA.&#13;
Separate audit statements would be prepared for the Special Accounts and for Statements&#13;
of Expenditures. All audit reports would be made available to IDA at the latest six&#13;
months after the end of the fiscal year. Project accounts would be maintained for one year&#13;
after they have been audited. The Beneficiaries will separately prepare and furnish to IDA&#13;
quarterly progress reports showing the status of implementation of the project as well as a&#13;
financial report in a format acceptable to IDA.&#13;
K. SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
47.   Project implementation will require intensive IDA staff involvement, especially&#13;
during the first 12 months of implementation and will require a high degree of flexibility in&#13;
view of the need to adapt to rapidly changing circumstances. Implementation progress&#13;
would be formally evaluated approximately 12 months after effectiveness, when project&#13;
implementation should be in full swing. In addition, the Resident Mission in Sarajevo&#13;
would assist in supervising initial project implementation and would assist closely on&#13;
matters requiring advice and rapid decisions by IDA, such as procurement and&#13;
disbursements.&#13;
IV. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ASPECTS&#13;
A. FINANCIAL ASPECTS&#13;
1. Past Performance and Current Situation&#13;
48.   EPBiH's financial statements, including forecasts up to the year 2000, are&#13;
presented in Attachment 9. Evaluation of its financial performance has to be approached&#13;
with caution due to the disruptions in data collection and accounting systems during the&#13;
war years, and the absence of audited accounts. In 1994 and 1995, EPBiH is estimated to&#13;
have incurred losses equivalent to about US$40 and US$78 million, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
Electricity sales in 1995, at 1,173 million kWh, were far below the peak levels reached in&#13;
1989 (when BH as a whole consumed about 11,700 milllion kWh). Furthermore, due to&#13;
the financial difficulties faced by households and corporate consumers during these years,&#13;
collection rates were very low, although collection performance improved substantially in&#13;
1995 to reach around 50% of cash operating expenses&#13;
49.   Cost Structure. Fuel (coal and oil) costs account for around 25% of EPBiH's&#13;
total operating expenses. EPBiH purchases its coal from domestic coal mines; costs per&#13;
gigajoule are high in relation to international standards but are expected to improve when&#13;
the coal mines are restructured. Operating and maintenance costs are at acceptable levels,&#13;
however, this is aided by the depressed levels of wages and salaries as well as the lower&#13;
than normal staff level. Depreciation charges have been only about 1.5% of gross fixed&#13;
assets during the war period; they will need to be increased to appropriate levels (at least&#13;
2.5% on average) and be reflected in the electricity prices, so that EPBiH can internally&#13;
generate adequate amounts of funds necessary for normal levels of investments and&#13;
operations.&#13;
50.   Tariffs. Considering the difficult situation in the war period, tariffs were&#13;
maintained at fairly high levels of about US$0.052 per kWh on average in 1995.&#13;
However, these levels do not fully cover costs. Moreover, the structure is distorted in&#13;
favor of households who, at only about US$0.024 per kWh, are charged far less than the&#13;
full cost of providing electricity; this encourages uneconomic use, including for space&#13;
heatinig. On the other hand, industries and high voltage users pay a tariff that may exceed&#13;
the effective cost.  Therefore, the tariff structure should be revised to reflect the&#13;
differentials in supply costs for different groups of customers. EPBiH should consider&#13;
introducing an interim tariff of about US$0.057 per kWh for consumption in excess of 150&#13;
kWh per month per household starting in 1997, in order to discourage space heating with&#13;
electricity, as opposed to with district heating or gas. Furthermore, tariff levels in general&#13;
would need to be raised progressively, first to permit adequate internal generation of funds&#13;
to cover EPBiH's expenditures and provide modest cash balances, and later to provide full&#13;
cost coverage as EPBiH undertakes further necessary efficiency-improving investments.&#13;
51.   Metering, Billing and Collection. Many households are not metered, and are&#13;
billed on the basis of estimated consumption. Large numbers of meters are needed,&#13;
essentially for households and small industries, which would be financed under the&#13;
distribution component of the proposed project (para 24). As a result of inadequate&#13;
metering as well as the impact of the war on consumers' finances, the collection rate as a&#13;
percent of billing dropped from 80% in 1991 to about 50% in 1995, ranging from near-&#13;
zero in the war-torn areas to close to the pre-war level in non- affected areas. This&#13;
collection performance can be expected to improve as meters are installed and the&#13;
authority of EPBiH agents in war-ravaged areas is restored.&#13;
52.   Receivables and Payables.  As of December 1995, receivables were about&#13;
US$66 million equivalent. Most receivables are due from entities depending on the&#13;
Government budget: municipal organizations, health institutes, schools, heating plants, and&#13;
urban transport enterprises. Regarding payables (US$70 million), the main creditors are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
the coal mines. EPBiH's outstanding long term debt is about US$230 million equivalent,&#13;
to which should be added the interest arrears accumulated since 1992 (about US$70&#13;
million on the outstanding IBRD loan amount of US$186 million alone).&#13;
2. Future Financial Performance&#13;
53.   EPBiH projects electricity sales to increase from 1,173 million kWh in 1995 to&#13;
about 3,700 million kWh in the year 2000. At these levels, electricity consumption would&#13;
remain far below the pre-war levels. At the same time, EPBiH's current tariff levels do&#13;
not even cover its cash operating expenses, resulting in further increases in its&#13;
indebtedness to suppliers. Therefore, as a first step, it is assumed that EPBiH would raise&#13;
its average tariff from the current level of about 5.4 cents per kWh to 6 cents per kWh&#13;
starting at the beginning of 1997, and maintain it at least at this level during the next few&#13;
years. Given the continuing financial difficulties faced by many of its customers, EPBiH&#13;
can expect to achieve only gradually full cost recovery. The collection rate (as a percent&#13;
of annual cash operating expenses) is expected to improve from about 50% in 1995 to at&#13;
least 60% in 1996, 90% in 1997, and 100% in 1998, in accordance with the targets agreed&#13;
with EPBiH.&#13;
54.   In addition to the above tariff and billing and collection measures, EPBiH&#13;
management would need to take steps to start improving the enterprise's productivity.&#13;
Since employment is expected to increase from the low present levels as staff returns from&#13;
the army, management would need to keep close control over labor costs, with wage and&#13;
salary increases not outstripping improvements in the enterprise's financial situation.&#13;
Total employment is therefore projected to increase by not more than 50 percent by the&#13;
year 2000, and wage and salary rates in 1996 and 1997 by not more than 12 and 25&#13;
percent, respectively, over the 1995 levels.&#13;
55.   Debt service on EPBiH's accumulated past debt and interest arrears have not been&#13;
taken into account in the financial forecasts pending a resolution of this issue. The State&#13;
Government recently received a Debt Consolidation Loan from the Bank, covering inter&#13;
alia the debt of EPBiH to the Bank. It is not known whether the State Government will&#13;
ask EPBiH to repay all or part of its past debts, or whether the State will assume the debt&#13;
repayment burden.&#13;
56.   With the assumed modest increase in average tariffs starting in 1997, and the cost&#13;
recovery and collection levels which are deemed to be the maximum achievable, EPBiH's&#13;
internal cash generation is projected to remain negative in 1996. However, thereafter&#13;
EPBiH should be able to at least break even in 1997 and reach by 1999 a modest positive&#13;
cash flow of about US$25 million per year, to be applied to the many alternative claims of&#13;
essential investments, reductions in payables, debt service, and the like.&#13;

B. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION&#13;
1. Demand Forecast&#13;
58.   Projections of the demand for electricity in Bosnia are highly speculative at present&#13;
because of uncertainties over future political and economic developments. However, they&#13;
are needed in order to evaluate investment requirements. EPBiH has prepared projections&#13;
making imaginative use of available information'. From an analysis of differences between&#13;
patterns of seasonal variation in demand before and after the war and the fact that&#13;
electricity rationing is relatively small during the summer, it has been estimated that&#13;
demand in 1995 would have been about 30% higher than the actual if there had not been&#13;
load shedding. New demand sparked by expected increases in economic activity will soon&#13;
add to the total. EPBiH projects total demand to return to within 90% of prewar demand&#13;
by the year 2000. Its base projection for the area served by the company as of February&#13;
1996 assumes that the total number of households served will increase from 450,000 in&#13;
1995 to 616,000 by 2000 and average household consumption will be 8 kWh per day (the&#13;
prewar level). Household sales would be 48% of total electricity sales by the distribution&#13;
entities. This is higher than the 40% experienced before the war, since industrial sales are&#13;
1  EPBiH accounts for almost 50% of installed generating capacity in BH and for 41% of the country's&#13;
total electricity generation in 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
not expected to fully recover, and increased demand by the service sector would not make&#13;
up for the industrial shortfall. Sales to EPBiH's direct industrial consumers were forecast&#13;
individually on the basis of specific information about the companies. Sales to these&#13;
companies are projected to grow to 720 GWh by 2000 compared to 60 GWh in 1995 and&#13;
1,083 GWh in 1990. Total electricity consumption within the territory served by EPBiH is&#13;
projected to increase by 150% from 1995 to 1998. Forecast electricity balances are&#13;
shown in Attachment 10. While EPBiH's forecast is plausible, account needs to be taken&#13;
of possibly slower growth in demand based on the possibility that the economy will not&#13;
return to the pre-war level until some time after the year 2000. The power investment&#13;
program would, in any event, increase supply by considerably less than the likely demand&#13;
increase. It would raise net power generation to only 38% of the 1990 level.&#13;
2. Benefits&#13;
59.  'T'he total estimated cost for the proposed project is about US$196 million, of&#13;
which about US$144 million (including the coal investments) is an integral part of the&#13;
1996-98 investment program applicable to the area served by EPBiH. In addition, the&#13;
program includes power investments under the Emergency Recovery Project (US$17&#13;
million). The economic analysis was carried out based on the whole investment program.&#13;
60.   The project is an integral part of the overall reconstruction program and its&#13;
absence would create a major bottleneck because the power system is already greatly&#13;
overloaded and most forms of economic activity depend on electricity. Frequent power&#13;
interruptions stop industrial processes, trams and trolley buses, computers, fax machines,&#13;
elevators, lighting, cooking and critical hospital activities. The proposed investments&#13;
would repair much of the damaged equipment in the power sector and permit the return to&#13;
operation of undamaged equipment by providing linkage. The additional power supply&#13;
(Attachment 11) would permit EPBiH to eliminate currently unmet demand estimated at&#13;
30% and satisfy one-half of the additional demand which is expected to occur up to 1998&#13;
as the economy revives. The additional power would allow a return to acceptable levels&#13;
of electricity service to households and other end-use consumers who have suffered&#13;
through numerous and prolonged blackouts and brownouts since the beginning of&#13;
hostilities. It would also forestall any tendency for industries and others to install costly&#13;
backup generators. The additional power supply, combined with the resumption of full&#13;
operation of the economy, would provide much needed revenue to the power sector.&#13;
61.   The coal mine rehabilitation component under this project will enable the thermal&#13;
power plants to resume the use of the domestic fuels for which they were designed and&#13;
supply cogenerated heat to the district heating systems of Tuzla and Zenica.  The&#13;
estimated per unit cost of additional coal supplied from these mines (US$0.028/kWh&#13;
generated) is less than the estimated cost of imported coal (US$0.039).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
3. Economic Rate of Return Calculation&#13;
62.   Benefits were estimated as the revenue from the additional electricity sold, valued&#13;
at the average tariff rate of US$0.054 applicable as of February 1996. The estimates&#13;
reflect willingness to pay by consumers from 1999 on. During the transition period it is&#13;
assumed that Government and/or donors would pay part of the electricity costs because of&#13;
the temporarily low incomes of consumers. The costs include: the proposed investments,&#13;
operation and maintenance costs, and fuel costs for additional thermal power generation at&#13;
Tuzia and Kakanj. Import duties were excluded. Fuel costs were calculated using the&#13;
incremental operating and maintenance cost of coal mines to be rehabilitated under the&#13;
coal component of the proposed project.&#13;
63.   The internal economic rate of return was estimated to be 33%, which is&#13;
satisfactory. It underestimates the true economic rate of return since many consumers&#13;
would be willing to pay more than the current price rather than do without electricity, as&#13;
demonstrated by their use of costly back-up generators. The results are very robust. The&#13;
changes needed to reduce the rate of return to 12% are: 30% lower revenue collection, or&#13;
90% higher investment costs, or a 5 year delay in benefits after investments are made. The&#13;
detailed results for the base case are in Attachment 12.&#13;
4. Risks&#13;
64.   There are significant risks associated with this project, other than a renewed&#13;
outbreak of hostilities. A general failure of economic growth to resume would have wide-&#13;
ranging implications, inter alia on the consumers' ability to pay. The resulting operating&#13;
deficits would either have to be funded by the Government budget and donors, or services&#13;
would have to be drastically cut back. The financial risk of EPBiH having inadequate cash&#13;
flow is being addressed by the project's emphasis on speedy reintroduction of billing and&#13;
collection systems in areas where this was not done during the war and by agreeing on&#13;
specific minimum targets for collections on an annual basis. A tariff study would be&#13;
implemented and, over the longer term, tariffs ought to reflect costs in order to ensure&#13;
adequate enterprise cash flow to maintain and expand the system. Although any remaining&#13;
cash deficits might affect operation and maintenance of the system, repairing it now would&#13;
still cost significantly less than repairing it later, assuming that minimal maintenance will be&#13;
provided.  Project cost overruns are possible, despite the inclusion of a 10% physical&#13;
contingency, if the damage in certain areas turns out to be more severe than expected.&#13;
Implementation delays might occur because of unexpected technical complications and&#13;
because of a possible multiplicity of procurement procedures, depending on the number of&#13;
donors and international financial institutions involved. The latter risk is manageable,&#13;
because international experts will assist EPBiH in procurement and project&#13;
implementation. The risk of the project's financing plan remaining incomplete (financing&#13;
gap) has been mitigated by the design of the project, with part or all of the thermal power&#13;
plants and coal mine rehabilitation to be deferred as required to meet the level of financial&#13;
resources.&#13;

EMERGENCY ELECTRIC POWER RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT&#13;
Project Description: Electric Power&#13;
1.    The primary objective of the project is to carry out emergency reconstruction in order&#13;
to improve the overall standard and reliability of the electric power service provided by the&#13;
EPBiH power system and to reduce the occurrence of power system outages through&#13;
reinforcement, rehabilitation, repair and maintenance of the most critical existing power system&#13;
facilities. The project seeks to assist in reconstruction, rehabilitation and maintenance of the&#13;
most urgently needed generation plants and transmission facilities through the provision of&#13;
equipment, materials, parts and services for plants and facilities located in various parts of the&#13;
system, particularly in the Tuzla, Zenica, Bihac, Mostar, Sarajevo and Banja Luka areas.&#13;
2.    Upon completion of the project, the subject plants and facilities will be in sound and safe&#13;
condition to provide a reliable basic electricity supply service for the above-mentioned major&#13;
cities and their environs. Without the project, a further deterioration in electric power service&#13;
with more power supply interruptions and load shedding can be expected.&#13;
3.    The scope of the physical project components consists of:&#13;
(i)   Jablanica Hydro Power Station (US$6.5 million): The power station is located&#13;
on the Neretva River. It is one of the major power plants in the EPBiH system,&#13;
with an installed capacity of 150 MW (6x25 MW), and was constructed in the&#13;
1950s. The availability of five out of the six units at this station has declined&#13;
significantly during the war. Among the five units, four units (4x25 MW) have&#13;
deteriorated extensively and need urgent overhaul. The rehabilitation would&#13;
include repair of the generators' winding, cooling and brake system, overhaul of&#13;
turbine runners, wicket gates, and regulators, and refurbishment of 110 kV&#13;
switchgear, control and protection, measuring and signalling equipment. The&#13;
units would be restored to normal operating condition.&#13;
(ii)   Grabovica Hydro Power Station (US$2.7 million): The power station is located&#13;
downstream (about 37 km from Mostar) of the Jablanica power station on the&#13;
Neretva River, with an installed capacity of 114 MW (2x57 MW). Rehabilitation&#13;
of this station's damaged tailrace is of prime importance. Tailrace failure can&#13;
well cause loss of the entire output of the plant. Without reinforcement of the&#13;
retaining wall and tailrace embankment, the failure is likely to be disastrous. The&#13;
emergency civil works would include:  (i) reinforcement of stilling basin,&#13;
retaining wall, and tailrace embankment; and (ii) dredging of the tailrace channel.&#13;
(iii)  Mostar Hydro Power Station (US$12.2 million): The power station is located&#13;
downstream (about 6 km from Mostar) of the Salakovac power station on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Attachment I&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
Neretva River, with an installed capacity of 75 MW (3 x 25 MW). Due to heavy&#13;
shelling the power station was badly damaged and the machine hall flooded. The&#13;
generators have been completely submerged for the last three years and have to&#13;
be lifted out for cleaning and corrosion damage inspection. Sensitive control and&#13;
regulation equipment has been completely damaged and stolen and must be&#13;
replaced. The rehabilitation work would include: (i) preliminary works and&#13;
spillway rehabilitation; (ii) rehabilitation of generators/turbines; (iii) rehabilitation&#13;
of electric, measuring and control systems; and (iv) rehabilitation of auxiliary&#13;
equipment.&#13;
(iv)  Jajce I Hydro Power Station (US$0.9 million): The rehabilitation would include:&#13;
(i) rehabilitation of 2 x 25 MW generator; (ii) replacement of turbine parts and&#13;
drainage pumps; and (iii) repair of turbine governors and auxiliary&#13;
electromechanical equipment.&#13;
(v)   Tuzla Coal-Fired Combined Heat and Power Plant (US$9.2 million): This power&#13;
plant, which suffered direct damage during the war, consists of 6 units with a&#13;
total installed capacity of 779 MW. The one 100 MW is heat and power&#13;
cogeneration unit, which provides hot water for the heating of 16,000 dwelling&#13;
units. Rehabilitation of this district heating capacity has priority. The project&#13;
will supply all equipment, materials and spare parts to carry out the urgent repair&#13;
of this cogeneration unit. Rehabilitation work would include the steam generator&#13;
plant, turbine plant, electrical equipment, measuring and control systems,&#13;
auxiliary equipment, and refurbish and upgrading of the electrostatic precipitators&#13;
and environmental monitoring equipment. It is expected that the unit would be&#13;
able to provide reliable continuous service for another eight to nine years after&#13;
rehabilitation.&#13;
(vi)  Kakani Coal-Fired Combined Heat and Power Plant (US$12.6 million): The&#13;
power plant is located about 45 km north-west of Sarajevo, consists of 7 units,&#13;
with a total capacity of 578 MW. The two 110 MW units are cogeneration units,&#13;
which supply power to the grid and supply district heat to the town of Kakanj.&#13;
The condition of the units is marginal due to the war as well as prolonged periods&#13;
of little or no maintenance. Urgent rehabilitation is required. Rehabilitation&#13;
works would include steam generator plant, turbine plant, electrical equipment,&#13;
measuring and control systems, auxiliary equipment, and refurbishing and&#13;
upgrading of the electrostatic precipitators and environmental monitoring&#13;
equipment. After rehabilitation the units would be able to provide reliable&#13;
continuous service for another eight to nine years.&#13;
(vii) Ugljevik Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant (US$1.4 million): Rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance of the 1 x 300 MW unit and its auxiliary equipment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Attachment 1&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
(viii) Transmission Lines (US$16.9 million) and Substations (US$12.7 million): The&#13;
rehabilitation of the transmission facilities must be given top priority, since the&#13;
transmission lines and substations have been repeatedly attacked and heavily&#13;
damaged during the war.  Mine clearing will be carried out prior to the&#13;
commencement of reconstruction works. The scope of rehabilitation are listed in&#13;
Tables 1 and 2.&#13;
(ix)   Communication and System Control (US$3.7 million): The system control and&#13;
communication system has been extensively damaged. To regain control of the&#13;
power system and operate it efficiently, the microwave link Sarajevo-Kakanj has&#13;
to be urgently repaired and the supply and installation of a mainframe computer&#13;
at the Sarajevo Load Dispatch Center is required. Software and training would&#13;
be included in the contract for the mainframe computer.&#13;
(x)   Distribution Networks (US$55.8 million): The most urgent reconstruction needs&#13;
of distribution networks are in the districts of Sarajevo, Tuzla, Zenica, Mostar,&#13;
Doboj, Bihac, Grahovo, G. Vakuf, Maglaj, Banja Luka, Bijeljna, Pale, Trebinje,&#13;
Gorazde, Foca, Kopaci, Glamoc and Jajce. The required equipment consists of&#13;
standard 35 kV, 20 kV, 10 kV and 0.4 kV distribution equipment, and ripple&#13;
control system and communications, plus consumer connections, poles, and&#13;
meters.&#13;
(xi)   Maintenance Vehicles (6.8 million). Most of EPBiH's service vehicles were&#13;
damaged during the war. The project would provide a bare minimum of 119&#13;
vehicles with which EPBiH will be able to operate and carry out necessary&#13;
maintenance. The list of vehicles is provided in Note A.&#13;
(xii)  Spare Parts (US$12.5 million). The spare parts to be ordered are primarily for&#13;
maintenance of existing thermal power plants and for the transmission system.&#13;
This includes the reestablishment of sufficient stock levels with a minimum&#13;
inventory level of two years at the time of project completion.&#13;
4.    The technical assistance component is described in adequate detail in para 24 (j) of the&#13;
main text of the Technical Annex.&#13;

EMERGENCY ELECTRIC POWER RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT&#13;
Project Description: Associated Coal Mines&#13;
1.    The objective of the emergency rehabilitation program for coal mines associated with the&#13;
Tuzla and Kakanj thermal power plants is to ensure critical coal supply from the most efficient&#13;
mines (Dubrave, Sikylje and Banovici surface mines, and Mramor underground mine at Tuzla;&#13;
and Vrtliste surface mine, as well as Breza underground mine at Kakanj), in line with the fuel&#13;
needs of the Tuzla and Kakanj power plants. Equipment of the Ugljevik coal mine will also be&#13;
repaired to ensure coal supply for the Ugljevik thermal power plant.&#13;
2.    The rehabilitation works consist of the following:&#13;
(i) Materials, small equipment and services (US$10.2 inmillion). These supplies and services&#13;
are needed to boost production from mines which are in good operational condition and&#13;
have readily accessible coal reserves for low-cost exploitation. The supplies and services&#13;
are most critical for achievement of required output increases. The materials include:&#13;
(i) consumable materials such as tires, conveyor belts, cables, and spare parts for existing&#13;
equipment; (ii) replacement of key equipment items damaged beyond repair; and (iii)&#13;
small auxiliary equipment necessary for the operation or maintenance of existing main&#13;
production equipment in good condition. The services include the contracted overhaul&#13;
of major production equipment which can significantly increase coal output in a low-cost&#13;
manner.&#13;
(ii) Replacement Investments (US$6.0 million). Generally, investments are to be avoided in&#13;
the first-year of emergency rehabilitation work. The exception is the Vrtliste surface&#13;
mine at Kakanj because: (i) this is evidently the lowest cost, nearest and largest coal&#13;
resource for the Kakanj power plant; (ii) the existing equipment is damaged and&#13;
cannibalized beyond repair; and (iii) the relatively small investment in this mine is&#13;
enough to secure a minimum low-cost coal supply to the Kakanj power plant in the&#13;
medium/long-term. The replacement investments for the Vrtliste mine cover a small&#13;
fleet of mobile mining equipment capable of achieving the required coal production&#13;
increase in the medium-term, when the overburden/coal ratio can be kept at about 3. To&#13;
maintain the output with increasing overburden ratios, additional equipment would have&#13;
to be added in the longer term.&#13;
(iii) Technical Assistance (US$0.8 million). Consultants services are required to the Ministry&#13;
of Energy and Industry in preparing a restructuring plan for the coal sector. A review&#13;
of all operations of the coal companies will be undertaken to develop a strategy for their&#13;
adjustment or development and provide a basis for future investment decisions. The&#13;
review would be carried out jointly by local experts and experienced foreign consultants,&#13;
based on terms of reference agreed with the Bank.&#13;

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA&#13;
EMERGENCY ELECTRIC POWER RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT&#13;
Project Description: Procurement Monitoring and Audit Unit&#13;
A. Objectives&#13;
1.    The Government of BH, with the assistance of the international community, is&#13;
implementing its Emergency Reconstruction Program estimated to amount to about&#13;
US$5. I billion over the next three to four years. About US$1.8 billion have been pledged&#13;
in 1996 and contracts for an estimated US$1.5 billion are expected to be let during this&#13;
first year of the Program. By June 30, 1996 the World Bank Board of Directors would&#13;
have approved US$160 million and by September 30, 1996 another US$171 million would&#13;
be approved bringing the total World Bank commitments to US$331 million by September&#13;
30, 1996. These amounts would finance a total of sixteen projects across the key sectors&#13;
of the economy.&#13;
2.    To respond to the emergency needs of the country in a timely and efficient manner,&#13;
the Bank has adopted procurement procedures which allow the required speed and enable&#13;
rapid impact on post war reconstruction. These streamlined procedures are within the&#13;
framework of the procurement guidelines for goods, works, and use of consultants&#13;
services which apply to all Bank/IDA financed projects. To optimize the benefits to the&#13;
country and their intended beneficiaries, and to promote mobilization of additional&#13;
resources from abroad, the objectives of efficiency and economy should be adhered to at&#13;
all times. This objective would be achieved by the creation of a procurement monitoring&#13;
and auditing unit (PMAU) that ensures transparency of procurement process in all&#13;
Government executed projects. This has become all the more necessary because of the&#13;
absence of such mechanism in the country.&#13;
3.    To promote good governance practices, particularly in the use of public resources,&#13;
enhance fiscal responsibility and public accountability, Government would need to&#13;
establish a procurement monitoring and auditing system to serve all public transactions&#13;
regardless of the source of their financing. This function would be assigned to an&#13;
institution to be created by an Act of Parliament and reporting to it.&#13;
4.    Because of the urgency of establishing an effective and well functioning system as&#13;
soon as possible, an interim arrangement for one year, starting September 1, 1996 would&#13;
entrust the procurement monitoring and auditing function to an experienced and reputable&#13;
international firm, selected on a competitive basis and on terms of reference acceptable to&#13;
the Bank. The firm will have access, at all time, to all records and accounts of institutions&#13;
participating in procurement of goods and services under emergency reconstruction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Attachment 2.2&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
projects and programs financed or administered by the Bank/IDA. It is expected to&#13;
provide, in addition to the monitoring and normal audit of procurement transactions, the&#13;
design of monitoring and auditing systems and to extend necessary training to the staff of&#13;
the institution to be entrusted with this function throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina after&#13;
September 1997. The Government is expected to designate formally such a PMAU not&#13;
later than October 31,1996.&#13;
B. Tasks of the PMAU&#13;
5.    The selected firm  of consultants would carry out essentially the following&#13;
procurement monitoring and auditing tasks:&#13;
*     Monitoring of at least one full cycle of procurement and disbursement&#13;
transactions carried-out by each executing agency (PIU) for Bank/IDA financed or&#13;
administered projects.  The selection of the transactions at their different stages of&#13;
processing would be made randomly. The procurement monitoring will consist of an&#13;
assessment of methods and practices used by the executing agency concerned in procuring&#13;
goods and services. It will ensure that they are in line with the procurement policies and&#13;
procedures agreed to in the credit agreement and they are reflected adequately in the&#13;
tender documents issued and contracting practices of the executing agency. Monitoring of&#13;
additional contracts or steps of processing for the same project will be necessary only in&#13;
cases of observed important deficiencies in procurement practices.&#13;
*     Ex-post annual procurement audits will be carried-out for all projects&#13;
financed by the Bank up-to September 1, 1996. About 16 projects are expected to be&#13;
approved by such date and an estimated 600 contracts will be let under these projects by&#13;
September 30, 1997, about one third of this number will be under processing by&#13;
September 30, 1996.&#13;
*     Specific audits will be prepared as requested by Government or by the&#13;
World Bank as needed. It is expected that not more than four to five such specific audits&#13;
will be requested by the end of the contract period.&#13;
*     Submit findings according to pre-agreed time table to the head of the&#13;
executing agency, the government and the Bank for all the audits referred to above and&#13;
according to pre-agreed schedule, including recommendations for improvements or&#13;
adjustments.&#13;
*     Design a monitoring and auditing system with appropriate policies and&#13;
procedures to be applied to all government financed projects in Bosnia and Herzegovina&#13;
territory.&#13;
*     Provide necessary training to a core staff to take over the full procurement&#13;
auditing function by September 1997.&#13;
&#13;

C. Supporting Documentation&#13;
6.          In carrying out its monitoring and auditing tasks, the firm will refer, but not&#13;
exclusively, to the following key documentation related, inter alia, to the World Bank&#13;
Procurement Guidelines of January 1996 and Guidelines on Use of Consultants of August&#13;
1981; the Project or Program Credit and related Subsidiary Agreements; the Technical&#13;
Annex; the letter of invitation; the tender documents; the bidding documents; the bid&#13;
evaluation report; the contract and the purchase order; the letter of credit; the suppliers'&#13;
invoice and certificate of origin; the import documents and inspection certificates; any&#13;
other evidence of receipt of goods or services; the authorization of payment; the evidence&#13;
of payment; and the accounting records of approval, disbursements, and balance available.&#13;
D. Audit Scope and Staffing&#13;
7.    On the basis of the documentation indicated above, the PMAU will evaluate the&#13;
effectiveness of controls (segregation of functions and duties between initiation of&#13;
transaction, authorization, disbursement, and recording) and accuracy of documentation&#13;
presented. It will ascertain that all actions are properly authorized and approved,&#13;
contracting effected according to agreements, and expenditures eligible for Bank/IDA&#13;
financing and disbursement. The audit will confirm, as appropriate, the physical existence&#13;
of significant items procured.&#13;
8.    About 36 foreign expert-months are expected to be needed for the tasks outlined&#13;
above. They will be assisted by about ten local experts to constitute the core staff of the&#13;
PMAU to be created not later than October 31, 1996.&#13;
9.    During their one year contract, the selected international experts are expected to&#13;
devote about 60% of their time to project procurement auditing; 30 % to procurement&#13;
monitoring and 10% to designing the system's policies and procedures and providing&#13;
necessary training to the PMAU's staff. The project component is expected to cost about&#13;
US$1.2 million, of which about 50% would be in foreign currencies.&#13;

IRR  =  33%&#13;
Investment: Emergency Recovery Project plus Emergency Reconstruction Project&#13;
-  0 &amp; M: 3% of cumulated investments per year.&#13;
- Fuel: operating cost for incremental coal production of 562,000 tons in 1997 and 966,000 tons in 1998 and&#13;
thereafter, assumed equal to 50% of 1995 operating cost per ton for production at Tuzla.&#13;
- Revenue: assumes 1995 average tariff rate of US$0.054/kWh, increased sales over 1995 level equal to increased&#13;
generation attributable to the investments of 100 GWh in 1996, 1,083 GWh in 1997, and 1,463 GWh in 1998,&#13;
less 17% transmission and distribution losses (14% from 1999).&#13;
Revenue falls after 2000 due to ending of generation from 32 MW coal-fired units and after 2005 due to ending&#13;
of 100/1 10 MW rehabilitated units at Tuzla and Kakanj.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Emergency Electric
            Power Reconstruction Project are to: a) restore electricity
            service to acceptable levels targeting critical power
            plants, principal substations and major transmission lines;
            b) increase coal production in the most efficient mines; c)
            reconfigure the electric power network; d) enhance the
            sector's institutional capacity and improve its
            finances; and e) support sector restructuring. The
            projects' components consist of: a) electric power
            generation by rehabilitation of hydro and thermal power
            plants; reconstruction of distribution networks,
            transmission lines, and substations; and the purchase of
            service vehicles and spare parts; b) transmission and
            distribution of power; c) associated coal mines; and d) a
            procurement monitoring and audit unit component.
