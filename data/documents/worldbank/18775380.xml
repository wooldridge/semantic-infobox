The MDF-JRF Working Paper Series: Lessons Learned from Post-Disaster Reconstruction in&#13;
Indonesia was prepared by the Secretariat of the Multi Donor Fund for Aceh and Nias (MDF) and&#13;
the Java Reconstruction Fund (JRF). The World Bank serves as trustee of both funds. The series,&#13;
consisting of five working papers, was produced under the guidance of Shamima Khan, MDF and&#13;
JRF Manager. Anita Kendrick, Monitoring and Evaluation Officer of the MDF and JRF, developed&#13;
the concepts and managed the production of the Working Paper Series and the Knowledge Notes&#13;
based on each paper.&#13;
&#13;
This paper, Working Paper 4 in the series, is entitled More than Mainstreaming: Promoting&#13;
Gender Equality and Womenâ&#128;&#153;s Empowerment through Post-Disaster Reconstruction. The&#13;
paper is based on research and background text written by Mary Ann Brocklesby, World Bank&#13;
consultant. Shamima Khan provided general guidance, support and oversight of the entire writing&#13;
and production process. Anita Kendrick, MDF-JRF Monitoring and Evaluation Officer, managed&#13;
the paper preparation and provided editorial oversight and guidance to the design, content and&#13;
production process. Gillian Brown, Gender Specialist, and Helene Carlsson Rex, Senior Social&#13;
Development Specialist, World Bank, provided extensive and useful comments on the text as peer&#13;
reviewers. Sharon Lumbantobing managed the production process, and Kate Redmond and Devi&#13;
Asmarani provided editorial support.&#13;
&#13;
Other members of the MDF/JRF Secretariat team and consultants provided significant inputs to&#13;
the working paper on content, design, layout, and production as well as logistical support for&#13;
the review team: Safriza Sofyan, Deputy Manager of the MDF, along with Akil Abduljalil, Deslly&#13;
Sorongan, Inge Susilo, Eva Muchtar, Inayat Bhagawati, Nur Raihan, Nia Sarinastiti, Olga Lambey,&#13;
Amenah Smith, Friesca Erwan, Harry Masyarafah, and David Lawrence. Ola Santo and her team&#13;
from Studio Rancang Imaji prepared the design and layout of the Working Paper Series and&#13;
accompanying Knowledge Notes.&#13;
&#13;
The MDF Secretariat would like to thank the many partners and stakeholders who cooperated with&#13;
the review team during the fieldwork and research period. These included representatives of the&#13;
Government of Indonesia, including line ministries, as well as local governments of Aceh, North&#13;
Sumatra, and Nias, and donors, partner and implementing agencies, and beneficiary communities&#13;
in Aceh and Nias.&#13;

&amp;#12;THE MDF-JRF WORKING PAPER SERIES&#13;
&#13;
The Multi Donor Fund for Aceh and Nias (MDF) and the Java Reconstruction Fund (JRF) are widely&#13;
recognized as having played a significant role in the remarkable recovery of Aceh, Nias and Java,&#13;
following some of the worst disasters in Indonesia over the last decade.&#13;
&#13;
The MDF, and the JRF which is patterned after it, are each considered a highly successful model&#13;
for post-disaster reconstruction. Key factors in this success have been the leadership provided by&#13;
the Government of Indonesia and the strong partnership of multiple stakeholders in support of&#13;
the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s reconstruction agenda. The two programs have produced impressive results,&#13;
both in terms of physical reconstruction, and in the less tangible but equally important benefits&#13;
such as community empowerment, strengthened governance, and communities that are more&#13;
resilient to future disasters. The experiences of the MDF and JRF have generated many useful&#13;
lessons and created effective models and approaches that can be adapted and replicated in other&#13;
reconstruction contexts.&#13;
&#13;
The Secretariat of the MDF and JRF, as part of its culminating activities, has prepared a series&#13;
of working papers to document these achievements and lessons learned. The MDF-JRF Working&#13;
Paper Series: Lessons Learned from Post-Disaster Reconstruction in Indonesia consists of&#13;
five working papers covering five key areas. These are: 1) community driven approaches for&#13;
post-disaster recovery; 2) capacity building in a post-disaster context; 3) reconstruction of&#13;
infrastructure; 4) promoting gender equality and womenâ&#128;&#153;s empowerment through post-disaster&#13;
reconstruction; and 5) multi-donor trust funds as a framework for effective partnerships for&#13;
reconstruction. Each Working Paper describes the strategy and approaches adopted by the MDF&#13;
and/or JRF across its projects, notes the achievements, and draws lessons that will be useful in&#13;
other post-disaster settings. In addition to the full working papers, a series of Knowledge Notes has&#13;
also been prepared, providing a short summary of the key lessons and conclusions from each of&#13;
the longer working papers.&#13;
&#13;
This paper, Working Paper 4 in the series, is entitled More than Mainstreaming: Promoting Gender&#13;
Equality and Womenâ&#128;&#153;s Empowerment through Post-Disaster Reconstruction. It presents lessons&#13;
from the MDF and JRFâ&#128;&#153;s efforts to facilitate womenâ&#128;&#153;s empowerment and gender equality during the&#13;
reconstruction process. This paper documents a range of good practice examples from the JRF and&#13;
MDF, and makes experience-based recommendations for the kind of strategies and actions needed&#13;
to mainstream gender sensitive approaches in future reconstruction efforts.&#13;
&#13;
Collectively, the lessons and experiences from the MDF and JRF form a legacy of the remarkable&#13;
achievements of these two programs and the effective partnerships on which they were based.&#13;
We hope that the lessons captured in these papers will contribute to future reconstruction and&#13;
preparedness efforts in Indonesia and other disaster-prone countries around the world.&#13;

&#13;
                                     Indonesia is one of the most disaster prone countries in the world. It is vulnerable to earthquakes,&#13;
                                     tsunamis, landslides, floods, volcanic eruptions, and wildfires. Between 2004 and 2010 Indonesia&#13;
                                     experienced a series of devastating natural disasters which attracted an outpouring of support&#13;
                                     from around the world.&#13;
&#13;
                                     December 2004â&#128;&#148;Earthquake and Tsunami in Aceh&#13;
&#13;
                                     The earthquake and tsunami that struck Indonesia and several other countries in the Indian Ocean&#13;
                                     region on December 26, 2004 was one of the worst natural disasters in recorded human history.&#13;
                                     The massive earthquake measuring 9.1 on the Richter scale was centered in the Indian Ocean&#13;
                                     about 150 kilometers off the coast of the province of Aceh on the northernmost tip of the island&#13;
                                     of Sumatra. Huge tidal waves fanned across the Indian Ocean, causing death and destruction&#13;
                                     across Southern Asia including Thailand, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, and as far away as East&#13;
                                     Africa. No country suffered more than Indonesia. Waves towering ten meters high came&#13;
                                     crashing into the shoreline in Aceh. The scale of physical devastation and human suffering was&#13;
                                     enormous. In Aceh alone, 221,000 people were killed or missing, and over a half million were left&#13;
                                     homeless. As many as 750,000 people lost their livelihoods. At all levels, infrastructure was&#13;
                                     paralyzed or completely destroyed.&#13;
&#13;
                                     In minutes, human settlements along the coastline of Aceh and parts of North Sumatra were&#13;
                                     demolished. People, houses, boats, cars, and buildings were engulfed as the tsunami swallowed&#13;
                                     everything in its way. Villages were reduced to rubble where minutes before thriving communities&#13;
                                     had flourished. Many roads, bridges, communications systems, schools, hospitals and clinics&#13;
                                     collapsed or were severely damaged. Fishermen, farmers and others lost their livelihoods and&#13;
                                     many businesses were destroyed or could no longer operate.&#13;
&#13;
                                     The subsequent assessment of the impact of both disasters, conducted by the Government along&#13;
                                     with the World Bank and other partners, assessed the damage and needs to be US$4.9 billion.1 This&#13;
                                     figure was later revised to $6.2 billion.&#13;
&#13;
                                     The massive destruction in Aceh seriously affected provincial and local governments already&#13;
                                     weakened by years of conflict. The tsunami destroyed 21 percent of public buildings and 19 percent&#13;
                                     of the equipment in these buildings. Approximately nine percent of civil servants perished and at&#13;
                                     least 21 percent of surviving civil servants were severely affected, impacting their ability to function&#13;
                                     as a local government. Twenty-seven percent of public records were destroyed. The replacement&#13;
                                     value of these losses was estimated to be over $81 million.&#13;
&#13;
                                     Prior to the tsunami, governance in Aceh already faced numerous challenges, including lack of&#13;
                                     institutional capacity and inefficient delivery of public services such as health and education,&#13;
                                     especially in the rural areas. The tsunami exacerbated these challenges to say the least, and the&#13;

March 2005â&#128;&#148;Earthquake in North Sumatra and Aceh&#13;
&#13;
Just three months later on March 28, 2005, another massive earthquake measuring 8.7 on the&#13;
Richter scale struck Aceh and the neighboring province of North Sumatra. This quake devastated&#13;
the Nias islands in the province of North Sumatra, located in the Indian Ocean 130 kilometers off&#13;
the western coast of Sumatra just south of Aceh. The island of Simeulue, part of the province of&#13;
Aceh off the western coast of the mainland, was also hard hit. This second disaster resulted in the&#13;
death of nearly 1,000 people and the displacement of nearly 50,000 survivors. The earthquake&#13;
wreaked more havoc on an already ravaged area. The physical damage was severe. Approximately&#13;
30 percent of buildings were destroyed. The destruction rendered transportation and other critical&#13;
infrastructure inoperative, including the major ports linking the remote island populations with the&#13;
mainland. Nias and Simeulue stood among the poorest areas of Indonesia prior to the disasters and&#13;
were only further isolated by the destruction of the earthquake.&#13;
&#13;
These two disasters devastated two areas of Indonesia that were already grappling with multiple&#13;
challenges. The province of Aceh was in the grip of an internal conflict between the Acehnese&#13;

&#13;
                                     separatist rebel movement and the Indonesian military. This conflict, stretching over thirty years,&#13;
                                     had paralyzed development and economic growth, and had seriously weakened both public and&#13;
                                     private sector capacities. At the time of the December 2004 tsunami, poverty in Aceh was 28.4&#13;
                                     percent, substantially higher than the national average of 16.7 percent.2 The districts of Nias&#13;
                                     and South Nias on Nias Island ranked among the poorest districts in Indonesia. Poverty, largely&#13;
                                     attributable to the isolation of the island, was approximately 31 percent at the time of the March&#13;
                                     2005 earthquake.3 These dual challenges of poverty and isolation created an extremely difficult&#13;
                                     operating environment for reconstruction in Nias.&#13;
                                     	&#13;
                                     The local governments, already weakened by the conflict in Aceh and isolation in Nias, were&#13;
                                     initially overwhelmed by the disasters. Recognizing this, and recognizing the magnitude of the&#13;
                                     reconstruction task at hand, the central government created the Agency for the Reconstruction&#13;
                                     and Rehabilitation of Aceh and Nias (Badan Rekonstruksi dan Rehabilitasi Aceh dan Nias, widely&#13;
                                     known as the BRR) to manage reconstruction. This special agency was based in Aceh and led by a&#13;
                                     minister-level appointee who reported directly to the President.&#13;

May 2006â&#128;&#148;Earthquake in Java&#13;
&#13;
Disaster again struck Indonesia on May 27, 2006, when an earthquake measuring 5.9 on the Richter&#13;
scale hit the island of Java, resulting in extensive damage in the province of Central Java and the&#13;
Special Region of Yogyakarta. The earthquake hit one of the most densely populated areas in Asia,&#13;
claiming more than 5,700 lives and destroying over 280,000 homes. Damage to private houses made&#13;
up more than 60 percent of the total destruction, which also affected small and medium enterprises,&#13;
a large number of them home-based industries. While infrastructure suffered comparatively less&#13;
damage, hundreds of thousands of homes and smaller structures were destroyed.&#13;
&#13;
Many houses in the area had been built without proper reinforcement and with low quality&#13;
building materials, resulting in more deaths and damage than would normally be expected from&#13;
an earthquake of this magnitude. Approximately 40,000 people were injured in the earthquake.&#13;
Thousands of people were trapped and buried beneath their toppled houses and buildings.&#13;
&#13;
A joint team led by the National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas), with local governments&#13;
and the international community, prepared the preliminary Damage and Loss Assessment in order&#13;
to determine the overall needs for the rehabilitation and reconstruction phase. Total damage and&#13;
losses from the earthquake were estimated at around $3.1 billion.&#13;
&#13;
The economic impact of the earthquake was particularly heavy because of the concentration of&#13;
home-based industries in the areas destroyed by the earthquake. More than 650,000 workers&#13;
were employed in economic activities directly affected by the earthquake with close to 90 percent&#13;
of damage and losses concentrated in small and medium enterprises. Many of the home-based&#13;
industries in the areaâ&#128;&#153;s important handicraft sector were severely affected. Rebuilding homes&#13;
would also support recovery of home-based businesses and livelihoods.&#13;
&#13;
July 2006â&#128;&#148;West Java Tsunami&#13;
&#13;
Just two months later, on July 17, 2006, a second major submarine earthquake struck off the&#13;
southern coast of Java. The earthquake, measuring a magnitude of 7.7 on the Richter scale,&#13;
triggered a tsunami that caused widespread damage. The tsunami hit the south coast of West&#13;
Java, taking more than 650 lives and displacing over 28,000 people. Almost 1,000 people died&#13;
or remained missing and more than 50,000 people were displaced. Damage and losses reached&#13;
an estimated $112 million. Ciamis district, West Java, was the worst affected. Along the coast of&#13;
Ciamis alone, close to 6,000 families were displaced. The tsunami caused economic destruction in&#13;
the fishing villages and tourist resorts along the south coast of West Java, where large numbers of&#13;
fishing boats were lost and the small fishing ports destroyed.&#13;
&#13;
October and November 2010â&#128;&#148;Mount Merapi Volcanic Eruptions&#13;
&#13;
On October 26, 2010, disaster hit Java once again when Mount Merapi, a volcano located on the&#13;
border between Yogyakarta and Central Java, erupted. This was followed by seven additional major&#13;
eruptions, with the last one occurring on November 11, 2010. For two long weeks, the eruptions&#13;

                                     spewed hot gas into nearby villages and hot lava accompanied by hot gas flowed into several&#13;
                                     rivers. The clouds of hot ash and poisonous gas combined with heat clouds at temperatures of 600&#13;
                                     to 800 degrees Celsius incinerated everything they reached, including livestock, crops and trees&#13;
                                     that were essential to the livelihoods of evacuees. Ash rain, which blanketed everything in fine&#13;
                                     volcanic dust, was found in cities across Java. All villages within 20 kilometers of the crater were&#13;
                                     evacuated. Along with massive damage to local infrastructure, approximately 2,900 houses were&#13;
                                     destroyed and 350,000 people were displaced and accommodated in evacuation camps. Due to&#13;
                                     timely evacuation, casualties were limited but still almost 300 people perished and more than 500&#13;
                                     were injured. The eruptions impacted areas in the province of Central Java and the Yogyakarta&#13;
                                     Special Region, including some communities that had been affected by the 2006 earthquake and&#13;
                                     were still in the process of rebuilding.&#13;
&#13;
                                     These eruptions resulted in widespread damage to housing and local infrastructure, as well as&#13;
                                     loss of livelihoods. During the eruptions, volcanic debris mixed with rain flowed down the slopes&#13;
                                     of Mount Merapi as massive mud flows. In Java this is known as â&#128;&#156;lahar dinginâ&#128;&#157; or cold lava and&#13;
                                     is made up of ash and sand from the eruption which when combined with rain turns into thick,&#13;
                                     slushy rivers of mud that gather up everything in the way. Cold lava surged down the mountain&#13;
                                     burying entire villages, farms and fields. Huge boulders, trees, houses, livestock, motor bikes, and&#13;
                                     cars were carried away by the mud. Several villages located in the danger zone near the volcano&#13;
                                     were relocated to safer areas.&#13;
&#13;
                                     Facing the Future&#13;
&#13;
                                     The numerous disasters since 2004 are a stark reminder that Indonesia is highly prone to natural&#13;
                                     hazards. Improvements in early warning systems are expected to save lives, as will ensuring that&#13;
                                     homes and other structures are built to seismic resistant standards. Many of the homes destroyed&#13;
                                     during the earthquakes were found to have used poor quality materials and building techniques,&#13;
                                     both of which contributed greatly to the number of lives lost and the high level of damage. Through&#13;
                                     the recovery and reconstruction efforts following these disasters, Indonesia has learned many&#13;
                                     lessons. It has created institutions and put systems in place for disaster risk reduction. As a result&#13;
                                     of the recovery and reconstruction process communities across Aceh, Nias, and Java are more&#13;
                                     resilient to face future disasters.&#13;

The Multi Donor Fund for Aceh and Nias (MDF) was established in April 2005, in response to&#13;
the Government of Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s request to coordinate donor support for the reconstruction and&#13;
rehabilitation of affected areas following the December 2004 earthquake and tsunami, and the&#13;
subsequent March 2005 earthquake.&#13;
&#13;
The MDF pools $655 million in contributions from 15 donors. These funds amount to nearly ten&#13;
percent of the overall reconstruction funds. At the request of the Government of Indonesia, the&#13;
World Bank serves as Trustee of the MDF. Grant funds are provided to projects which are&#13;
implemented by government and non-government agencies and communities, with partner&#13;
agencies providing oversight. Partner agencies include the United Nations Development Programme&#13;
(UNDP), the World Food Programme (WFP), the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the&#13;
World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Under the MDF portfolio, 23 projects were financed in six outcome areas: (1) Recovery of&#13;
Communities; (2) Reconstruction and Rehabilitation of Large Infrastructure and Transport; (3)&#13;
Strengthening Governance and Capacity Building; (4) Sustaining the Environment; (5) Enhancing&#13;
the Recovery Process; and (6) Economic Development and Livelihoods. These projects reflected the&#13;
priorities of the Indonesian government throughout the reconstruction process.&#13;
&#13;
The MDF was coordinated by the Government of Indonesia, initially through the Agency for&#13;
the Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of Aceh and Nias (BRR), which was set up to manage the&#13;
reconstruction and recovery effort. After the BRR closed in April 2009, the National Development&#13;
Planning Agency, Bappenas, took on this critical role. The MDF is governed by a Steering Committee&#13;
with representatives from the government, donors, the trustee, and civil society. The Steering&#13;
Committee is supported in its work by a secretariat.&#13;

                                           Following a request from the Government of Indonesia, the Java Reconstruction Fund (JRF) was&#13;
                                           established to respond to the May 27, 2006 earthquake that struck near Yogyakarta, and the&#13;
                                           tsunami that hit the southern coast of West Java Province in July 2006. The JRF was later extended&#13;
                                           to respond to volcanic eruptions of Mount Merapi in October and November of 2010. The JRF&#13;
                                           program closed on December 31, 2012.&#13;
&#13;
                                           The JRF is based on the successful model of the Multi Donor Fund for Aceh and Nias. Seven&#13;
                                           donors supported the JRF with contributions totaling $94.1 million. The donors are: the European&#13;
                                           Union, the Governments of the Netherlands, United Kingdom, the Asian Development Bank,&#13;
                                           Canada, Finland and Denmark. The World Bank serves as Trustee of the JRF. Following the&#13;
                                           governmentâ&#128;&#153;s priorities, the JRF supports the recovery of communities and livelihoods, and increases&#13;

                                           The JRF was coordinated by the Government of Indonesia, initially through the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                                           National Coordinating Team (NCT) and the National Technical Team (TTN). After the mandate of&#13;
                                           the NCT and the TTN ended in 2008, the JRF worked with the National Planning Agency (Bappenas)&#13;
                                           and the Provincial Planning Agencies (Bappeda) for the overall coordination of the reconstruction.&#13;
&#13;
                                           Using a governance structure similar to the MDF, the JRF was governed by a Steering Committee&#13;
                                           with representatives from the Government of Indonesia and donors. Bappenas co-chaired the&#13;
                                           Steering Committee, along with the European Union as the largest donor, and the World Bank&#13;
                                           as Trustee. The Steering Committee is supported by a secretariat. Through shared staffing and&#13;
                                           expertise with the MDF for Aceh and Nias, the secretariat achieved efficiencies of scale, resulting in&#13;

                                           The JRF portfolio consisted of five projects which drew from the MDFâ&#128;&#153;s experience and used a&#13;
                                           phased approach to address: (1) Transitional Housing; (2) Restoring Housing and Community&#13;
                                           Infrastructure; and (3) Restoring Livelihoods. The World Bank had a supervisory and oversight role&#13;
                                           on all JRF projects as the partner agency.&#13;

The JRF Portfolio&#13;
&#13;
The JRF portfolio followed a phased approach to reconstruction, adopting lessons learned from&#13;
the MDF. Early support focused on meeting housing and community recovery needs and&#13;
subsequent support focused on addressing economic recovery. The JRF prioritized disaster risk&#13;
reduction in all its programs. Five projects were supported:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Transitional Housing Projects (2 projects totaling $2.3 million). The JRF financed two transitional&#13;
housing projects, implemented by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and&#13;
Cooperative Housing Foundation (CHF) International and managed by the World Bank. The projects&#13;
provided nearly 5,000 transitional shelters.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 The Community-based Settlement Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project (1 project&#13;
totaling $75.1 million), better known as Rekompak, made up most of the JRF funding allocation.&#13;
Following the model established in Aceh, it used a community driven approach to rebuild homes&#13;
and local infrastructure in earthquake affected areas of Yogyakarta Special District, and Central&#13;
Java, and later, parts of West Java affected by a subsequent earthquake and tsunami. After&#13;
the 2010 eruptions of Mount Merapi, the project was expanded further. Implemented by the&#13;
Ministry of Public Works (MPW) and managed by the World Bank, the project rebuilt over 15,000&#13;
houses and completed over 4,000 local infrastructure projects.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Livelihood Recovery Projects (2 projects totaling $17.1 million):&#13;
   -	 The Livelihood Recovery in Yogyakarta Special District and Central Java project&#13;
   contributed to the Government of Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s initiatives to assist micro, small and medium&#13;
   enterprises (MSMEs) affected by the earthquake to revitalize their businesses and re integrate&#13;
   affected low-income communities into economic life. The project provided access to finance,&#13;
   developed loan work-out strategies for defaulting borrowers, restored capacity and improved&#13;
   competitiveness of medium-sized companies in Yogyakarta and Central Java. The project&#13;
   was implemented by the Deutsche Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) and&#13;
   managed by the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
  -	 The Access to Finance and Capacity Building for Earthquake Affected Micro             and Small&#13;
  Enterprises project, implemented by the IOM and managed by the World Bank,               supported&#13;
  the recovery of micro and small enterprises in Yogyakarta and Central Java               to enable&#13;
  them to reach their pre-earthquake capacity. It provided asset replacement,              marketing&#13;
  support, and techical assistance. The project worked with over 4,000 micro               and small&#13;
  enterprises (MSEs), over 40 percent run or owned by women.&#13;

Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    Reconstruction processes in the wake of a disaster are a window of opportunity to address&#13;
                    gender and other social inequalities. Disasters create legitimate reasons to do things differently:&#13;
                    to introduce new polices, programs and legislation and support progress towards womenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                    empowerment and gender equality.&#13;
&#13;
                    Both men and women are vulnerable to disaster impacts, but gender inequalities create distinct&#13;
                    disparities. For example, women suffer more seriously from psycho-social trauma, long-term&#13;
                    displacement, loss of homes and jobs and chronic poverty. Following recent disasters in Aceh,&#13;
                    Nias and Java, work and care responsibilities increased dramatically for women survivors.&#13;
                    Women were less able to access information or to share assets and benefits equitably with men,&#13;
                    and were less likely than men to have their voices heard in setting the agenda for reconstruction.&#13;
&#13;
                    The experiences of the Multi Donor Fund for Aceh and Nias (MDF) and the Java Reconstruction&#13;
                    Fund (JRF) offer valuable lessons about strategies and actions to support gender equality, womenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                    empowerment, and mainstreaming gender sensitive approaches in reconstruction efforts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    Experiences in Enhancing the Role of Women under the MDF and&#13;
                    JRF Programs&#13;
                    Improved and sustained outcomes in housing and infrastructure: Womenâ&#128;&#153;s active participation&#13;
                    and greater control over decisions through community driven approaches led to positive changes&#13;
                    in the design and selection of housing and local infrastructure. This improved quality and cost&#13;
                    efficiency and increased ownership and satisfaction, thereby enhancing willingness to sustain and&#13;
                    maintain new assets.&#13;
&#13;
                    Faster economic and livelihood recovery and increased productivity: Women made up over 40&#13;
                    percent of the workforce, working mainly in small and medium enterprises and in agriculture&#13;
                    (often as unpaid family labor). Economic regeneration was accelerated by womenâ&#128;&#153;s participation&#13;
                    in livelihood recovery. In Java, women managed nearly 50 percent of the JRF livelihood recovery&#13;
                    supported enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
                    Strengthening of womenâ&#128;&#153;s legal rights: Women are particularly vulnerable to the loss of land and&#13;
                    property rights post-disaster. Almost 30 percent of the land certificates issued in Aceh under the&#13;
                    MDF were for women, strengthening the livelihood security of women-headed households, and&#13;
                    opening up their access to credit and productive assets. A community driven approach to the&#13;
                    adjudication of land rights was established, which has set future patterns for land adjudication.&#13;
&#13;
                    More representative decision making: Womenâ&#128;&#153;s active participation in local decision-making&#13;
                    processes increased social cohesion and made local institutions more representative. Outcomes&#13;
                    changed as a result, leading to an increase in provision of public goods such as water, sanitation&#13;
                    and health clinics. Women reported positive impacts on the levels of womenâ&#128;&#153;s involvement in&#13;
                    village and public affairs. Men recognized the benefits of women having a more active voice in&#13;
                    public affairs.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                     23&#13;

                                                                                                            More Than Mainstreaming: Promoting Gender Equality and&#13;
Enhanced resilience for women and communities: Womenâ&#128;&#153;s active involvement in reconstruction,&#13;
community settlement planning, livelihood recovery and disaster risk reduction increased their&#13;
resilience in case of future disasters. Women learned skills and gained knowledge that enabled&#13;
them to build and maintain their livelihoods and cope with losses. Women were more responsive&#13;
than men, for example, to the importance of earthquake safe construction practices and principles,&#13;
and to build soft skills such as knowledge networks, marketing, and business skills.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Promoting Womenâ&#128;&#153;s Participation and Access to Benefits&#13;
Experiences from the MDF and JRF reveal a number of opportunities as well as challenges for&#13;
advancing gender equality in decision making and benefit sharing.&#13;
&#13;
Access to information can be a major barrier to womenâ&#128;&#153;s participation. Throughout the&#13;
reconstruction process, community meetings and notice boards were the main mechanisms&#13;
for information exchange and triggering womenâ&#128;&#153;s participation in reconstruction efforts.&#13;
But in communities where levels of trust were low, and in those with higher levels of rivalries&#13;
and factionalism, womenâ&#128;&#153;s ability to access information was highly dependent on their access to&#13;
village leaders. More powerful members of communities controlled information flow, leading to&#13;
dissatisfaction with access to information.&#13;
&#13;
Social capital plays a part in open information flow â&#128;&#148;the stronger the levels of mutual trust, the&#13;
greater the circulation of information. Projects which tapped into strong local networks, particularly&#13;
those linking women, were most effective in helping women to rebuild their lives by supporting&#13;
womenâ&#128;&#153;s access to information.&#13;
&#13;
Psycho-social stress undermines womenâ&#128;&#153;s capacities to participate meaningfully in project&#13;
activities. Infrastructure and economic development projects, which are a large proportion of post-&#13;
disaster reconstruction, generally do not incorporate strategies and actions aimed at addressing&#13;
the psychological impacts of trauma, and specific measures are needed to do so. One MDF project&#13;
implemented by the Canadian Cooperative Association (CCA) focused initially on peace building,&#13;
counselling and sensitization activities. Starting with small savings and loans groups, the project&#13;
was able to build the trust, confidence and emotional security of participants to re-engage with&#13;
profitable livelihood activities, and only later supported major economic development for women&#13;
through cooperative development.&#13;
&#13;
A clear lesson is that building into a project a response to alleviate the impacts of psycho-social&#13;
trauma will require extra time and resources. However, better understanding of the impacts of&#13;
disaster will help identify respectful and sensitive starting points for different and incremental levels&#13;
of support. Failure to do so will exclude the most affected women and will undermine potential&#13;
benefits not only for the women involved, but for the overall recovery as well.&#13;
&#13;
There are trade-offs between operating at scale and ensuring participation of poor and&#13;
marginalized women. Large-scale community infrastructure projects with ambitious delivery&#13;
&amp;#12;24&#13;
Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    targets often do not have the flexibility, time and resources to reach and involve poorer and isolated&#13;
                    women meaningfully in decision-making. Such projects can, however, coordinate interventions&#13;
                    with smaller organizations which have the mandate and capacities to work with marginalized&#13;
                    women. The Kecamatan Development Project (KDP), for example, used non-MDF funds to support&#13;
                    PEKKA (the Program for Women-Headed Households in Indonesia), a complementary program that&#13;
                    worked exclusively with poor, vulnerable and marginalized widows. This enabled both projects to&#13;
                    work to their strengths and bring a greater number of poorer women into community planning&#13;
                    processes.&#13;
&#13;
                    Formal partnerships and linkages between projects to address gaps in delivery to marginalized and&#13;
                    disadvantaged women is a smart investment. These partnerships improve project outcomes and&#13;
                    open up space for strengthening the role of women in the overall reconstruction process.&#13;
&#13;
                    Strengthening womenâ&#128;&#153;s voice in reconstruction processes requires focused and active&#13;
                    facilitation. Setting head count targets and encouraging women to be present and to speak&#13;
                    is necessary for increased involvement of women, but not sufficient to empower them to&#13;
                    exercise leadership. The impact of such targets alone on womenâ&#128;&#153;s ability to engage meaningfully&#13;
                    in community planning and decision making is modest, leaving women, especially poor and&#13;
                    disadvantaged women, consistently dissatisfied with their limited opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
                    When projects used active facilitation strategies (e.g., women-only meetings, a longer time spent&#13;
                    on mobilizing women, women facilitators, or house visits) to enrich the quality of womenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                    participation, womenâ&#128;&#153;s role in project decision making and in implementation was enhanced.&#13;
&#13;
                    Support to build womenâ&#128;&#153;s skills and capacities for resilient livelihoods is an investment for the&#13;
                    future. Livelihood and community recovery programs that committed time and resources to&#13;
                    developing soft skills, such as knowledge networks, marketing, and business expertise, were more&#13;
                    likely to build resilience among women, providing them with competencies, knowledge and skills&#13;
                    to cope with possible future disasters.&#13;
&#13;
                    More needs to be done to ensure womenâ&#128;&#153;s equal participation in Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR).&#13;
                    There were missed opportunities to harness womenâ&#128;&#153;s commitment to DRR in reconstruction&#13;
                    interventions, and to involve them in sustaining community resilience for the future. Building the&#13;
                    capacity of project staff to include gender mainstreaming in DRR planning or gender-sensitive&#13;
                    communication strategies is necessary to optimize womenâ&#128;&#153;s impact in future reconstruction.&#13;

                    Key Lessons for Promoting Womenâ&#128;&#153;s Equality through&#13;
                    Reconstruction&#13;
                    â&#128;¢	 Make gender equality a fully integrated objective of reconstruction strategies.&#13;
                       Projects need to be designed and implemented with a clear objective to improve gender&#13;
                       equality and womenâ&#128;&#153;s economic empowerment for better quality outcomes. Budgets should be&#13;
                       realistic, gender equality linked to indicators and accurately monitored, and exit strategies must&#13;
                       accommodate womenâ&#128;&#153;s needs. Specific gender-based actions arising from project objectives&#13;
                       must be fully funded, supervised and evaluated.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                        25&#13;

â&#128;¢	 Integrate gender analysis and gender-disaggregated data into post-disaster needs and loss&#13;
   assessments.&#13;
   Damage and Loss Assessment after the disasters need to be gender-sensitive for responsive&#13;
   programming to the different needs of men, women, boys and girls. This is critical so that:&#13;
   a) there is a shared baseline for implementing agencies, and b) information is available to&#13;
   mainstream gender issues into the national recovery and reconstruction strategy.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Develop sector-wide and theme-based gender analysis as early as possible after a disaster.&#13;
   Complementary to the Damage and Loss Assessment, sector-based gender analyses can inform&#13;
   early recovery and reconstruction and support better coordination and linkages between&#13;
   different sector interventions, and support the transition from recovery to development.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Strengthen operational gender expertise.&#13;
   A major gap for agencies working on reconstruction was the lack of experienced operational&#13;
   gender experts for post-disaster reconstruction, especially in housing and reconstruction. Such&#13;
   expertise is essential to mainstream gender into infrastructure and livelihood recovery projects.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Institutionalize gender in operational procedures, supervision and support systems.&#13;
   Routine and fully-budgeted supervisory support needs to include performance indicators&#13;
   and review, coaching and mentoring, and gender support networks. Operations manuals&#13;
   of implementing agencies should include clear guidelines for addressing gender issues in&#13;

â&#128;¢	 Include quantitative and qualitative gender sensitive indicators in results frameworks.&#13;
   Future reconstruction efforts will benefit from stronger gender indicators tracking the quality of womenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
   participation and gender quality results in access to benefits and jobs, and need to go beyond gender&#13;
   disaggregated data.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
Promoting womenâ&#128;&#153;s empowerment in reconstruction requires the commitment and effort of all&#13;
stakeholders. Gender equality must be facilitated at every level â&#128;&#147; in the international aid community,&#13;
in national and local government, and in projects and communities. Policies and encouragement are&#13;
not enough; additional investment and support are needed to turn good intentions into outcomes.&#13;
This is not just a moral obligation; it is quite simply â&#128;&#156;smart economics.â&#128;&#157; Everybody benefits.&#13;
&#13;
The experience of promoting womenâ&#128;&#153;s equality and empowerment was uneven in the MDF and JRF&#13;
reconstruction processes, all providing lessons for the future. A range of good practice&#13;
examples abound throughout the programs. At the same time, processes and mechanisms&#13;
for actively involving women in decision-making and implementation could have been better&#13;
institutionalized. Barriers to womenâ&#128;&#153;s involvement are generally high, but the costs of ignoring&#13;
gender in disaster reconstruction are potentially enormous in terms of overlooked damages,&#13;
needs and priorities that exacerbate poverty and inequalities. As good practice lessons&#13;
from MDF and JRF projectâ&#128;&#153;s experiences show, when women are active participants in&#13;
reconstruction with a voice to shape the design and management of reconstruction, there are&#13;
better quality outcomes for everyone.&#13;

                        In the wake of a disaster, reconstruction processes are a window of opportunity to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                     Empowering Women through Post-Disaster Reconstruction&#13;
                                                                                                                     More Than Mainstreaming: Promoting Gender Equality and&#13;
                        address gender and other social inequalities. Disasters engender socially acceptable&#13;
                        and legitimate reasons to do things differently: to introduce new polices, programs and&#13;
                        legislation and support progress towards womenâ&#128;&#153;s empowerment and gender equality.&#13;
                        The scale of the response to the Indian Ocean Tsunami provided a unique moment. The&#13;
                        Government of Indonesia (GoI), in its commitment to â&#128;&#156;Build Back Better,â&#128;&#157; grasped the&#13;
                        opportunity, first in Aceh and Nias and later in Java. Gender equality was one of the&#13;
                        guiding principles adopted by the GoI and its donor partners in its reconstruction plans.&#13;
                        Despite many constraints, advances towards gender equality were acknowledged in the&#13;
                        reconstruction processes.1&#13;
&#13;
                        This working paper documents best practices and lessons learned from the MDF and&#13;
                        JRFâ&#128;&#153;s experiences promoting gender equality and empowering women through post-&#13;
                        disaster reconstruction. It focuses on a particular set of reconstruction interventions in&#13;
                        Aceh, Nias and Java: community infrastructure, housing and livelihood recovery. The&#13;
                        paper explores the level of gendered change and the extent to which womenâ&#128;&#153;s voices&#13;
                        and agency impacted on reconstruction in the MDF and JRF funded projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                             What is Gender Equality?&#13;
&#13;
                             â&#128;&#156;Equality between women and men (gender equality): refers to the equal rights,&#13;
                             responsibilities and opportunities of women and men and girls and boys. Equality&#13;
                             does not mean that women and men will become the same but that womenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                             and menâ&#128;&#153;s rights, responsibilities and opportunities will not depend on whether&#13;
                             they are born male or female. Gender equality implies that the interests, needs&#13;
                             and priorities of both women and men are taken into consideration, recognizing&#13;
                             the diversity of different groups of women and men.â&#128;&#157;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            The purpose of the paper is a practical one: to contribute to international understanding&#13;
                                            about what works well or what doesnâ&#128;&#153;t work in promoting womenâ&#128;&#153;s empowerment&#13;
                                            and gender equality in relation to community and livelihoods recovery in post-&#13;
                                            disaster contexts. These are interventions where women, particularly in housing and&#13;
                                            infrastructure, have frequently been marginalized in reconstruction processes.2 They&#13;
                                            are also areas where, because womenâ&#128;&#153;s roles have so frequently been undervalued,&#13;
                                            the potential for transformative change in terms of promoting gender equality,&#13;
                                            creating equitable and more representative decision making, and increasing economic&#13;
                                            productivity for women post disaster is greatest.&#13;
&#13;
                                            The working paper focuses particularly on the experiences and lessons learned from&#13;
                                            projects in two outcome areas of the MDF and JRF funding portfolios: community&#13;
                                            recovery projects comprising eight projects which supported reconstruction and&#13;
                                            rehabilitation of community infrastructureâ&#128;&#148;roads, drainage, housing and public&#13;
                                            buildings, and livelihood recovery projects, comprising four projects aimed at&#13;
                                            contributing to the GoIâ&#128;&#153;s efforts to rebuild livelihoods post-disaster. All of these&#13;
                                            projects included elements in their design, implementation and institutional&#13;
                                            arrangements to promote the participation of women in project activities and as direct&#13;
                                            beneficiaries. The 12 projects selected for this paper are summarized below. MDF&#13;
                                            and JRF projects working to ensure womenâ&#128;&#153;s participation in disaster preparedness&#13;
                                            processes are also included in this study in order to ensure their lessons for future&#13;
                                            programs are captured.3&#13;

                                               terms with men in decision-making processes during reconstruction.&#13;

CDD approach are a range of mechanismsâ&#128;&#148;block grants to communities to plan and&#13;
build small-scale infrastructure, open and transparent decision-making between local&#13;
government and communities, user-friendly complaint-handling mechanisms, targets for&#13;
womenâ&#128;&#153;s participation as beneficiaries and staffâ&#128;&#148;aimed at gender equitable community-&#13;
led reconstruction. The biggest â&#128;&#147; the Kecamatan Development Project â&#128;&#147; a large and&#13;
significant long-term project across rural Indonesia, had been active in Aceh since 1999&#13;
and also operated in Nias. The Urban Poverty Program was KDPâ&#128;&#153;s sister project operating&#13;
in urban and peri-urban municipalities. Like KDP, UPP was part of a wider project across&#13;
Indonesia, operating in Aceh before the tsunami. Both KDP and UPP were scaled up&#13;
in both the area and size of their operations under MDF support. A third community-&#13;
driven project, the Community-Based Settlement Rehabilitation and Reconstruction&#13;
Project (CSRRP), widely known by its Indonesian acronym Rekompak, envolved out of&#13;
the UPP and supported the Goverment of Indonesia to rebuild housing and community&#13;
infrastructure post-disaster in Aceh. The Nias Kecamatan-based Reconstruction and&#13;
Rehabilitation Planning Project â&#128;&#147; KRRP used a combination of the KDP and Rekompak&#13;
approach for housing and community reconstruction adapted to working in the remote,&#13;
hard-to-reach rural areas of Nias. Another MDF project on community recovery was the&#13;
Reconstruction of Aceh Land Administration System (RALAS), which aimed to support&#13;
the reconstruction of property rights and issuing of land title certificates to women and&#13;
men. The RALAS project also provided support to the reconstruction and development&#13;
of land institutions in Aceh with attention to the land administration systems.&#13;
&amp;#12;32&#13;
                           The MDF also funded three projects as part of its reconstruction of infrastructure,&#13;

                           support the active participation of women in project activities. Two of these were the&#13;
                           ILO implemented local road rehabilitation projects: Capacity Building for Local Resource-&#13;
                           based Rural Roads Project (CBLR3), implemented in Aceh and Nias, and the Rural Access&#13;
                           and Capacity Building Project (RACBP) in Nias. The third was the Tsunami Recovery&#13;
                           Waste Management Programme (TRWMP) implemented in Aceh and Nias. TRWMP was&#13;
                           developed to address the public health and environmental concerns of the disasters.&#13;
                           It transitioned into a program focused on building capacities of local government for&#13;
                           sustainable municipal solid waste management, creating long-term employment&#13;
                           opportunities in recycling, and rehabilitating Acehâ&#128;&#153;s waste management infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
                           JRF â&#128;&#147; Community Recovery Projects: Rekompak was replicated in Java under the JRF&#13;
                           for housing reconstruction and community planning and reconstruction of community&#13;
                           infrastructure. Building on successes and learning from the implementation lessons of&#13;
                           Rekompak MDF, it focused on providing transitional shelters for the survivors of the&#13;
                           earthquake and volcanic eruption, seismic-resistant permanent houses, community&#13;
                           resettlement plans, and community infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
                           MDF Livelihood Recovery Projects: MDF supported two separate projects. The&#13;

                           economic development and poverty alleviation through development of a variety of&#13;
                           key commodities. It also provided assistance to the Government of Aceh in project&#13;
                           management and capacity building. The Nias Livelihoods and Economic Development&#13;
                           Project (LEDP) facilitated post-disaster recovery and poverty alleviation, working through&#13;
                           local government to empower and build the capacities of poor rural households to&#13;
                           sustain livelihood opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
                           JRF Livelihood Recovery Projects: JRF funded two complementary projects aimed at&#13;
                           supporting livelihood recovery in earthquake-affected areas in Yogyakarta and Central&#13;
                           Java. The GIZ-implemented Livelihood Recovery Project supported micro, small and&#13;
                           medium enterprises (MSMEs) affected by the earthquake by providing access to finance,&#13;
                           micro-credit and technical assistance. Gender inclusiveness was embedded in all&#13;
                           components of the project with targets set for womenâ&#128;&#153;s participation, access to benefits&#13;
                           and inclusion in the management and decision-making processes of the project. The&#13;
                           IOM-implemented Livelihood Recovery Project in Java used a participatory community&#13;
                           mobilization approach that provided training and technical assistance, business support,&#13;
                           and replacement of equipment and tools. Women were targeted both as beneficiaries&#13;
                           and as key actors in the capacity building activities to improve linkages between MSEs,&#13;
                           local governments, NGOs and the private sector.&#13;

1.2 Outline of the Working Paper&#13;
      Following the introduction, Section 2 examines gender issues in disasters and the different&#13;
      gender contexts in Aceh, Nias and Java. Section 3 considers the institutional responses&#13;
      to gender issues in Indonesia and specifically in the MDF and JRF. Section 4 explores&#13;
      the main lessons learned with regard to the role of women in community planning and&#13;
      the prioritization of needs. Section 5 addresses the experiences and lessons learned&#13;
      about womenâ&#128;&#153;s economic empowerment and the access to benefits under community&#13;
      and livelihood recovery projects. The final section looks ahead to the design of future&#13;
      post disaster projects and programs in the light of the lessons learned about the role of&#13;
      women in reconstruction under the MDF and JRF.&#13;

WHY GENDER MATTERS IN DISASTERS&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                                                              35&#13;
                         Gender matters in disasters. Pre-existing structures, systems and social conditions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                     Empowering Women through Post-Disaster Reconstruction&#13;
                                                                                                                                                     More Than Mainstreaming: Promoting Gender Equality and&#13;
                         determine that natural disasters will affect some members of the population more,&#13;
                         and in different ways, than others. Gender is one of the differences that influence how&#13;
                         individuals are affected as well as their capacities to survive and withstand the impacts&#13;
                         of disaster. While both men and women are vulnerable to the impacts of disaster, pre-&#13;
                         existing gender inequalities create distinct disparities in how men and women are&#13;
                         affected in the aftermath of disaster. Natural disasters, on average, kill more women&#13;
                         than men, and women are likely to die from disaster impacts at a younger age than&#13;
                         men.1 More women than men died in the disasters that hit Aceh, Nias and Java, creating&#13;
                         long-term gendered demographic imbalances.2 In Aceh, it is estimated that two thirds&#13;
                         of those who died in the in the 2004 tsunami were women, the majority of whom&#13;
                         were young girls and older women. These women were most impacted because their&#13;
                         childcare responsibilities and livelihood activities were at home, while men were more&#13;
                         likely to be away from home. In Aceh, many of the men were fishing out at sea, and out&#13;
                         of immediate danger.3 Cultural norms prevented many women from having learned to&#13;
                         swim; when the wave hit, the attempts of women to save their children and the elderly&#13;
                         prevented many of them from escaping the waves themselves.4 Of the major disasters&#13;
                         covered by the MDF and JRF, only in the 2010 Mount Merapi eruptions were more of the&#13;
                         fatalities men than women.5&#13;
&#13;
                         Post-disaster, womenâ&#128;&#148;particularly poor and older women and those marginalized&#13;
                         by, for example, ethnicity, culture, or beliefâ&#128;&#148;are at greater risk than men of psycho-&#13;
                         social trauma, long-term displacement, loss of homes and jobs and chronic poverty.6&#13;
                         Increased rates of domestic violence, alcoholism amongst men and underage marriages&#13;
                         are often recorded post disaster, all contributing to violations of womenâ&#128;&#153;s rights and&#13;
                         their capacities to demand appropriate support and response.7&#13;

                evacuated to safe areas.&#13;

                                                              responses that overlook what the realities of disaster mean to both women and men&#13;

                                                              Gender roles can and do change post-disaster as a result of death, displacement, loss&#13;
                                                              of possessions and social connections and even, as happened in Aceh, loss of the&#13;
                                                              whole community. Post-disaster aid may either further womenâ&#128;&#153;s equality or undermine&#13;
                                                              womenâ&#128;&#153;s rights if pre-existing gender dynamics are not fully understood and addressed.&#13;

                                                              women and men were very different and significantly affected womenâ&#128;&#153;s abilities to&#13;
                                                              access support and take part in reconstruction processes. These differences were not&#13;

                                                              Thirty years of conflict in Aceh profoundly affected gender relations. While outside&#13;
                                                              agencies attempted to make distinctions between conflict and tsunami-affected areas,&#13;
                                                              for the Acehnese there was no real distinction. Most households in some way had&#13;
                                                              been affected by both the impacts of the conflict and the tsunami. While men had a&#13;
                                                              higher profile during the conflict, womenâ&#128;&#153;s roles, both direct and indirect, were often&#13;
                                                              overlooked. Women were involved sometimes as combatants or as front-line support,&#13;
                                                              and more frequently in maintaining their communities and households as well as&#13;
                                                              providing shelter and support for combatants when they returned home. Pre-tsunami,&#13;
                                                              an estimated 23 percent of households were women headed, significantly higher than&#13;
                                                              the national average of around 11 percent.9 Conditions for women were harsh; their&#13;
                                                              mobility was restricted by curfew, road blocks and fear. The conflict exposed women&#13;
                                                              to high levels of gender-based violence. Social networks were severed, trust within&#13;
                                                              and between communities broke down and womenâ&#128;&#153;s already traditionally limited&#13;
                                                              public roles became even more restricted. Both women and men suffered high levels&#13;
                                                              of psycho-social trauma due to the conflict that was compounded by the devastation&#13;

                                                              conflict. In August 2005, a memorandum of understanding was signed between the&#13;
                                                              GOI and the Aceh Independence movement. The resulting peace process ran in parallel&#13;
                                                              with reconstruction. Over time the BRR encouraged greater donor involvement in areas&#13;

                religious, cultural and educational affairs. Depending on how the law was interpreted at&#13;
                local levels there were significant impacts on womenâ&#128;&#153;s lives. In some parts of Aceh, for&#13;
                example, reports indicated that curfews for women had been introduced, as well as the&#13;
                policing of â&#128;&#156;inappropriate dress and behaviorsâ&#128;&#157; by women.10&#13;
&#13;
                 Acehnese women, particularly unmarried women, were traditionally involved in unpaid&#13;
                subsistence work in agriculture or fisheries. At the time of the tsunami there had been&#13;
                a noticeable shift for women from unpaid work to selfâ&#128;&#147;employed, low-profit work.&#13;
                These were often in informal home-based micro enterprises because of childcare and&#13;
                household responsibilities. Limited access to markets and capital as well as restricted&#13;
                mobility during the conflict had greatly limited livelihood opportunities for women&#13;
                outside the home.11&#13;

                                                            Gender relations on Nias Island are patriarchal and deeply unequal. Men control assets,&#13;

                                                            Women have no customary inheritance rights, work predominantly as unpaid family&#13;
                                                            laborers on the family farms and plantations, and have limited access to education and&#13;

                                                            can only spend the money they actually earn, largely through petty trading. There are&#13;
                                                            very few opportunities for women to work in the cash economy; less than 40 percent&#13;

                                                            Underlying the gender inequalities is the tradition of dowry (jujuran) or bride wealth.&#13;
                                                            Before marrying, men will pay jujuran of between 70 -100 million rupiah in gold, goods&#13;
                                                            and money.13 Jujuran shapes gender relations. Women are perceived as a commodityâ&#128;&#148;&#13;

                                                            The isolation and poverty of Nias have resulted in high levels of out and circular migration&#13;
                                                            among men and younger women in search of jobs and a better life. Older women with&#13;

                                              2.3 Women in Post-Disaster Central Java and Yogyakarta&#13;
                                                            Gender relations in Central Java and Yogyakarta are understood in terms of domains.&#13;
                                                            Women are highly influential in, and at times control, the private domain of home and&#13;
                                                            household. Men dominate the public domain of work, politics and community decision-&#13;

                                                            all contributed to blurring the boundaries between these domains, particularly in the&#13;
                                                            urban areas of Yogyakarta and central Java. Nevertheless, â&#128;&#156;â&#128;¦ women in Javanese society&#13;
                                                            are... (still) known as a manâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#152;koncowingking,â&#128;&#153; or the husbandâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#152;friend in the backâ&#128;&#153;.â&#128;&#157;14&#13;
                                                            This sense of different domains has influenced the role women play in public decision&#13;

                absent or silent within public fora, especially in rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
                Within the household women have a great deal of control over household budgeting&#13;
                and expenditure and maintain their own assets (gold or livestock, for example). Women&#13;
                expect their husbands to give them the income from employment or the sale of assets.&#13;
                Women play an important role in maintaining household security, working as unpaid&#13;
                family labor, or as day laborers on farms. Many rural households, owning little land,&#13;
                have diversified livelihood activities into low profit home-based industries in order to&#13;
                survive. These industries, such as batik making, running food stalls, and mobile catering,&#13;
                to name a few, are dominated by women, who were severely impacted by the loss of&#13;
                their livelihoods post-disaster. While there are high levels of out and circular migration&#13;
                by men in rural areas, women are less able to move because of childcare responsibilities,&#13;
                restricted public networks and, for poorer women, lower educational levels. The result&#13;
                is high numbers of de-facto women-headed households; in some of the communities&#13;
                affected by the earthquake and volcanic eruptions, over 30 percent of the households&#13;
                were headed by women.15&#13;
&#13;
                The tradition of â&#128;&#156;gotong royongâ&#128;&#157; (self-help and mutual cooperation) is strong in central&#13;
                Java and played a significant role for both men and women in accelerating livelihood&#13;
                recovery. However, in some communities, particularly those displaced by the disaster,&#13;
                there was evidence that â&#128;&#156;gotong royongâ&#128;&#157; was under considerable strain, causing social&#13;
                tension and distrust between community members.16 These social tensions impacted most&#13;
                on the poorest and most disadvantagedâ&#128;&#148;mostly women, who, as a result, experienced&#13;
                difficulties in accessing information about, and support for rebuilding their lives. External&#13;
                agencies did not necessarily respond to the changing dynamics or adjust their intervention&#13;
                strategies, thus sometimes inadvertently reinforcing social divides and exclusion.&#13;

                      otherwise: women actively fight for their communitiesâ&#128;&#153; survival.1 Despite the trauma,&#13;
                      women are able to maintain their normal responsibilities, more so than men, who&#13;
                      in some cases are violent or manic in response to post-disaster trauma.2 Women&#13;
                      mobilize their own formal and informal social networks and kinship groups to meet&#13;
                      needs, organize shelter and care for affected members of their extended families. In&#13;
                      the immediate aftermath of disasters in Aceh, Nias, and Java, women survivors were&#13;
                      essential partners with men in their communities, taking responsibility for the sick&#13;
                      and injured, supporting children, foraging for food, finding water and keeping the&#13;
                      household together. Their designated social roles as caregivers and nurturers naturally&#13;
                      extended to risk management, to secure life and to maintain the life support systems.&#13;

                           â&#128;&#156;We were all frightened and traumatized, both men and women.&#13;

                           the children. It wasnâ&#128;&#153;t just the men doing the work. We took it&#13;
                           in turns to keep our houses safe, and both men and women&#13;
                           went looking for food. In fact it was us women who were most&#13;
                           active in finding food. The men were too frightened to go to&#13;
                           the farms.â&#128;&#157;&#13;

                      The emergency response post-tsunami did not consult women effectively and as a&#13;
                      result, the subsequent design and implementation of reconstruction efforts in many&#13;
                      cases did not adequately address womenâ&#128;&#153;s needs. Damage and loss assessments3&#13;
                      (DALA) were mostly conducted by male-dominated teams relying on information&#13;

hit Yogyakarta in May 2006. The JRFâ&#128;&#153;s livelihoods recovery programs&#13;
provided an opportunity for women to learn new skills and develop&#13;
business opportunities that helped them increase incomes and build&#13;
their confidence to engage more actively in their communities. This&#13;

                  reconstruction. As a result, gender equality objectives came after other commitments,&#13;
                  such as rebuilding the infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
                  Donors and civil society, especially womenâ&#128;&#153;s advocacy organizations in Aceh, played a&#13;
                  significant role in bringing gender issues back to the forefront of reconstruction efforts&#13;
                  once the emergency phase was over in Aceh and Nias. In April 2006, concerns about&#13;
                  limited progress led the BRR to establish multi-stakeholder gender working group to&#13;
                  develop a gender strategy. BRRâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#156;Promoting Gender Equality in the Rehabilitation&#13;
                  and Reconstruction Processâ&#128;&#157; strategy document was launched in September 2006.&#13;
                  It confirmed commitments to gender equality and outlined a gender mainstreaming&#13;
                  strategy in the formulation of policies, planning and implementation in all sectors,&#13;
                  including economic development and infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
                  The BRR Gender Policy was a significant milestone for the mainstreaming of gender&#13;
                  equality perspectives and womenâ&#128;&#153;s concerns into the GoIâ&#128;&#153;s goal of â&#128;&#156;Build Back Betterâ&#128;&#157;.&#13;
                  It aimed at improving equality after reconstruction by transforming gender roles and&#13;
                  relations. Key components of the strategy with the best opportunities to progress&#13;
                  transformational change were the focus on:&#13;
&#13;
                  â&#128;¢	 womenâ&#128;&#153;s empowerment â&#128;&#147; ensuring womenâ&#128;&#153;s active participation in reconstruction&#13;
                     efforts, and&#13;
                  â&#128;¢	 womenâ&#128;&#153;s economic empowerment â&#128;&#147; promoting womenâ&#128;&#153;s access to economic&#13;
                     opportunities and an emphasis on equal distribution of economic resources.&#13;
&#13;
                  These are the two areas that, globally, are the most challenging elements of gender&#13;
                  equality to address9 and in Indonesia are the two areas of gender equality where&#13;
                  progress had been slow overall.10 However, the gender strategy was only partially put&#13;
                  into action. BRRâ&#128;&#153;s division for Womenâ&#128;&#153;s Empowerment was tasked with coordinating,&#13;
                  supporting and supervising the implementation of the policies and strategies&#13;
                  formulated in the strategy. BRR also had a gender specialist and senior-level technical&#13;
                  support from UNIFEM. However, the operational structure of BRR meant that BRRâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                  gender competence was largely at the margins of the reconstruction process, limited&#13;
                  to specific womenâ&#128;&#153;s empowerment issues. The womenâ&#128;&#153;s empowerment unit had few&#13;
                  resources and little influence on large-scale interventions, into which MDF funds&#13;
                  were channeled,such as housing, infrastructure, and economic development. These&#13;

                Secondly, the process of gender mainstreaming is a holistic one requiring investments&#13;
                in capacities, programming resources and the systems and mechanisms for diagnostics,&#13;
                supervision, monitoring and staffing. It also takes time. Lack of time was cited as the&#13;
                primary reason for not mainstreaming gender in design and early implementation,&#13;
                even in projects designed years after the initial disaster when speed of delivery was no&#13;
                longer an issue. Yet international experience indicates that gender sensitivity speeds&#13;
                up rather than slows down transition from relief to reconstruction and transition to&#13;
                development.12&#13;

                the GOI and agencies working on reconstruction was the lack of experienced operational&#13;
                gender experts for post-disaster reconstruction, coupled with the low numbers of women&#13;
                in senior positions, particularly in infrastructure and housing. A common frustration&#13;
                for project staff, including community facilitators, was that they wanted to do more to&#13;
                facilitate womenâ&#128;&#153;s empowerment, for example, but lacked the practical skills and expertise&#13;
                to do so. Gender expertise, when available, was often focused towards gender advocacy,&#13;
                essential but not sufficient to mainstream gender into infrastructure and livelihood&#13;
                recovery processes. A further constraintÂ­   â&#128;&#148;particularly in Aceh and Nias where local&#13;
                capacities were much weaker than in Javaâ&#128;&#148;was the unintended dilution of capacities of&#13;
                local civil society organizations (and to some extent what was left of local government)&#13;
                with operational experience in implementing gender-sensitive programs. The better&#13;
                working conditions and salaries of international organizations led to the most experienced&#13;
                staff leaving and few opportunities for local organizations to replace them or strengthen&#13;
                their own institutional gender capacities. The implications for long-term sustainability&#13;
                are profound. Gender equality mechanisms cannot be institutionalized through&#13;
                individuals; strong organizations that can carry forward the lessons learned post-&#13;
                reconstruction are necessary. Womenâ&#128;&#153;s empowerment, for example, takes time, much&#13;
                longer than the typical 2-5 year timeframe of reconstruction projects. It needs structures&#13;
                in place to nurture, sustain and build on gains made. A lesson for future disasters is that&#13;
                mechanisms which require short-term projects to work through local NGOs will be more&#13;
                effective in sustaining advances in gender equality.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.3 Gender and the MDF-JRF&#13;
                Gender and strengthening the role of women in reconstruction through promoting&#13;
                womenâ&#128;&#153;s empowerment was one of the cornerstones of MDF and JRF policies guiding&#13;
                project approval, monitoring and review. The Recovery Assistance Policy (RAP) of the&#13;
                MDF, approved by its Steering Committee, outlined the actions that projects were&#13;
                expected to take in order to promote gender concerns in design, implementation and&#13;
                monitoring.15 However, the structures, systems and capacities of both the MDF and&#13;
                the JRF were not optimized to promote gender equality or actively support projects&#13;
                to meet their gender objectives. The lack of an overarching gender-mainstreaming&#13;
                strategy within the funds themselves linked to a dedicated budget and staff resources&#13;
                certainly limited the ability to pro-actively advance gender equality concerns within&#13;
                the project portfolios. Neither program employed a dedicated gender technical&#13;
                advisor within their secretariats. Despite the availability of funds and a high level&#13;
                commitment to gender mainstreaming, the absence of in-house gender expertise&#13;
                limited the ability to operationalize a gender focus across the program. By design,&#13;
                the MDF and JRF relied on their partner and implementing agencies to provide the&#13;

                                                            time and resource constraints meant that gender monitoring and oversight was not&#13;

                                                                                           More Than Mainstreaming: Promoting Gender Equality and&#13;
targets for womenâ&#128;&#153;s participation or gender trainings and capacity building. The lack&#13;
of gender equality objectives meant that both financial and staffing resources were&#13;
limited or time constrained because gender equality activities were subsumed under&#13;
broader objectives. It also resulted in weakly defined gender-sensitive indicators and&#13;
monitoring processes.&#13;
&#13;
Results Framework informed by gender baselines and indicators: A social and gender&#13;
baseline provides the means to measure gender progress and with it the changing role&#13;
of women in reconstruction. It allows the results frameworks to be tailored to context&#13;
and realistic gender-sensitive outcomes and indicators in accordance with projects.&#13;
Neither fund established their own gendered baselines, relying solely on the data from&#13;
the damage and loss assessments and funded projects. However, with few exceptions&#13;
(KDP, UPP, GIZ Livelihoods recovery and TRWMP for its livelihoods component) project&#13;
baselines, when they existed, had little in the way of socially disaggregated or gender-&#13;
specific data. Social and gender indicators were also inconsistent and not necessarily&#13;
aligned with the Results Frameworks which were also inadequate in gender sensitive&#13;
indicators. Where they did exist they were often output-and target-orientated (e.g.&#13;
number of trainings, number of women participating in meetings, etc.). A required&#13;
mix of output and outcome indicators providing gender information on, for example,&#13;
gender equality, participation, and womenâ&#128;&#153;s empowerment would have been much&#13;
stronger. The lack of such indicators led to under reporting of positive gender-focused&#13;
results. For example, innovative approaches towards strengthening information flows&#13;
to women in project areas that enhanced the level and quality of womenâ&#128;&#153;s participation&#13;
under the Capacity Building for Local Resource-based Rural Roads (CBLR3) project&#13;
were not adequately reported and captured in results frameworks. Conversely, some&#13;
projects had no formal data for analyzing changes in womenâ&#128;&#153;s voice and agency. Less&#13;
than 50 percent of the Aceh Economic Development Financing Facility (EDFF)â&#128;&#153;s sub-&#13;
projects had a gender baseline or gender-sensitive indicators. They were unable to&#13;
provide gender sensitive data that would have allowed EDFF to assess the extent to&#13;
which womenâ&#128;&#153;s empowerment had been progressed by project activities.&#13;
&#13;
Practical operational gender technical reviews of projects: An acknowledged&#13;
weakness of the technical reviews was the generic, abstract gender review of project&#13;
proposals. Donors often took the lead, through the MDF and JRFâ&#128;&#153;s Technical Review&#13;
Groups (TRG), in ensuring a gender focus was incorporated into project proposals at&#13;
review and approval stage. While donor attention had a positive impact in supporting&#13;
improved attention to gender in project designs, this is not the most effective way&#13;
of operationalizing a commitment to gender focus in projects. External agencies&#13;
like donors by necessity can only play a limited role. They cannot and should not be&#13;
available for routine technical guidance on gender issues. This was the role of the&#13;
partner agencies, but with no mechanism to enforce compliance and few internal&#13;
resources devoted to gender within the secretariats, the operational aspects of&#13;
addressing gender were often overlooked or not fully incorporated into the design,&#13;
systems and processes of projects.&#13;

                                                            Gender focus in operational manuals: Operational manuals are the key organizational&#13;

                                                            information in operational manuals is a major reason why lessons learned about what&#13;
                                                            works in strengthening the role of women in reconstruction are not institutionalized&#13;

                                                            Gender equality objectives were not mainstreamed into any of these instruments&#13;

                                                            absence of such formal accountability mechanisms, however, joint monitoring missions&#13;
                                                            with donors and partner agencies were a valued way of informally influencing attention&#13;
                                                            to gender and social issues. Gaps in gender mainstreaming in the first phase of ILOâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;

                                                            a considerable increase in womenâ&#128;&#153;s involvement in the projectâ&#128;&#153;s subsequent phase.&#13;
                                                            However, the process was highly dependent on the interests and capacities of donors&#13;
                                                            and managers. Gender mainstreaming was often a low priority for the government&#13;
                                                            agencies implementing these projects in a difficult reconstruction setting in which they&#13;
                                                            faced significant implementation challenges beyond mainstreaming gender.&#13;

                                                            that gender equality was promoted and gender issues were mainstreamed was not&#13;

                                                            had more direct responsibility for ensuring that projects addressed gender and the&#13;
                                                            role of women. The role of the funds and specifically their respective secretariats was&#13;
                                                            one of oversight and supervision. However, this may have been a missed opportunity&#13;
                                                            to provide a strategic overview for gender issues and a coordinating role between&#13;

significant advances were achieved in enhancing the role of women in the MDF&#13;
and JRF programs. Policies changedâ&#128;&#148;the GoIâ&#128;&#153;s championing of womenâ&#128;&#153;s legal rights&#13;
through the joint titling initiatives is one example. Programs changedâ&#128;&#148;for example&#13;
the acceptance of womenâ&#128;&#153;s employment in non-traditional areas such as road&#13;
building. Attitudes towards womenâ&#128;&#153;s roles in reconstruction also changed with a&#13;
growing awareness inside and outside of government of womenâ&#128;&#153;s right to participate&#13;
as leaders and shapers of reconstruction. These developments are explored in the&#13;
following sections.&#13;
&#13;
A key lesson learned is that future reconstruction programs will need systems, capacities&#13;
and staff focused on gender issues to support womenâ&#128;&#153;s empowerment. More&#13;
effective oversight requires a pro-active staff in place with the competence to generate&#13;
and support explicit gender quality result statements, gender-focused performance&#13;
indicators, clear operational guidelines and strong accountability mechanisms. Putting&#13;
these resources and mechanisms in place from the outset of every reconstruction&#13;
program will provide the institutional support to allow women to play a greater role in&#13;
future post-disaster recovery situations.&#13;

                        the prioritization of needs is a recognized challenge in post disaster reconstruction.1&#13;
                        The urgency of disaster response sometimes overrides policies that exist to ensure&#13;
                        women are empowered to participate actively in planning and implementation. This&#13;
                        is particularly true for infrastructure, where the push for speedy delivery of essential&#13;
                        infrastructure undermines gender equality in planning and delivery.2&#13;
&#13;
                        This section explores the strategies and processes used by MDF and JRF projects in their&#13;
                        efforts to address the challenge of ensuring womenâ&#128;&#153;s participation and to strengthen&#13;
                        the role of women in community planning and the prioritization of needs. It looks at&#13;
                        what worked and what was less successful in supporting women to access information&#13;
                        about reconstruction opportunities and strengthening womenâ&#128;&#153;s voice, agency and,&#13;
                        participation. In spite of structural and operational challenges and limitations, the MDF&#13;
                        and JRF projects by and large had positive experiences in these areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
       4.1 Womenâ&#128;&#153;s Access to Information&#13;
&#13;
                        There is no easy way to improve information flows to women. Projects depend on village&#13;
                        leaders and community facilitators to spread information. In post-disaster situations&#13;
                        where communities have been displaced and social cohesion fractured by loss and&#13;
                        trauma, reaching women is doubly difficult. Work and care responsibilities increased&#13;
                        dramatically for women survivors in all three regions. They were the primary support&#13;
                        for sick and frightened children, the injured and elderly and for keeping the household&#13;
                        functioning.3 All of these responsibilities gave women, especially the poorest women&#13;
                        and those heading households, little time to attend community meetings or participate&#13;
                        actively in reconstruction.&#13;
&#13;
                        Mobility and security, always barriers to womenâ&#128;&#153;s participation, become major stumbling&#13;
                        blocks to accessing information. Road and pathway blockages increase fears of accidents&#13;
                        or attack and make it difficult to move around or get to community meetings. Poor and&#13;
                        isolated women are especially disadvantaged because of their social and spatial distance&#13;
                        from village leaders.&#13;

information for women especially difficult:&#13;

    â&#128;&#156;We donâ&#128;&#153;t get much information. We didnâ&#128;&#153;t know what was&#13;
    happening, unless our husbands told us. The distance makes a&#13;
    difference. The further away from the village head the harder it&#13;
    is to get to know about projects to get support. Meetings were at&#13;
    night and we couldnâ&#128;&#153;t get to them; it was too far, too dangerous to&#13;
    go out and anyway we couldnâ&#128;&#153;t leave our families.â&#128;&#157;&#13;

aftermath of disasters. This woman, a member of a batik producersâ&#128;&#153; group in Central Java,   IOM&#13;

Strengthening womenâ&#128;&#153;s voice in reconstruction processes requires focused and&#13;
active facilitation. Setting head count targets and encouraging women to be present&#13;
and to speak is necessary for increased involvement of women, but not sufficient to&#13;
empower them to exercise leadership. The impact of such targets alone on womenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
ability to engage meaningfully in community planning and decision making is modest,&#13;
leaving women, especially poor and disadvantaged women, consistently dissatisfied&#13;
with their limited opportunities. When projects used active facilitation strategies to&#13;
enrich the quality of womenâ&#128;&#153;s participation, not only did the overall number of women&#13;
involved increase, their role in project decision-making and implementation was also&#13;
strengthened.&#13;
&#13;
Achievements&#13;
&#13;
Higher levels of womenâ&#128;&#153;s participation benefitted the whole community. Womenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
active participation led to higher levels of satisfaction with the quality and design of&#13;
both community infrastructure and private housing. Rekompak projects in all three&#13;
regions for example, recorded higher satisfaction rates than other housing projects. In&#13;
Java, 97 percent of all community participants surveyed in an evaluation were satisfied&#13;
with rehabilitated housing and infrastructure.&#13;

The projectsâ&#128;&#153; insistence on including women in leadership committees and setting&#13;
targets for levels of womenâ&#128;&#153;s participation led to higher levels of womenâ&#128;&#153;s participation&#13;
than in comparable projects. The trend across all projects was towards greater gender&#13;
equality in decision-making with approximately 25 percent of village management&#13;
leaders being women. There were differences between projects and within projects&#13;
between different communities relating to the different contexts and social dynamics&#13;
of communities. In Aceh and Nias for example, there were disparities in womenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
participation between different districts in TRWMPâ&#128;&#153;s cash-for-work program. Overall (in&#13;
13 districts) women comprised 19 percent of the 700 workersâ&#128;&#148;the daily average, but&#13;
women were highly visible in Aceh Barat (48 percent), Aceh Besar (42 percent) and South&#13;
Nias (42 percent). However, in Aceh and Nias, by 2007, more than 1.1 million women&#13;
(over 65 percent of the total) had participated in community-level planning activities of&#13;
MDF post-tsunami projects according to the MDF 2007 progress report. The KDP project&#13;
recorded average participation levels of 46 percent for women in Aceh, significantly&#13;
higher than the 30 percent government targets. In Java, both livelihood recovery&#13;
projects exceeded their initial targets of 30 percent representation of women. About 44&#13;
percent of the GIZ and 42 percent of the IOM beneficiaries receiving technical assistance&#13;
under the JRF livelihoods recovery projects were women and close to 57 percent of the&#13;
micro-credit borrowers were women, significantly higher than the percentage of women&#13;
involved in government income generating projects.&#13;
&#13;
Women-only meetings built confidence and agency. In post-disaster situations womenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
agency is severely constrained and opportunities to facilitate womenâ&#128;&#153;s empowerment&#13;
compromised by weakened organizational capacities or limited resources. In these&#13;
circumstances, women-only meetings are an important mechanism for strengthening&#13;
womenâ&#128;&#153;s agency. The projects which institutionalized women-only meetings in&#13;
implementation had, for example, higher levels of womenâ&#128;&#153;s participation and provided a&#13;
space for women to develop the skills and confidence to engage actively in mixed public&#13;
fora.&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;&#156;I learned to be strong in the women-only meetings, to give my&#13;
    opinions. It helped when we met together in community meetings&#13;
    (with men). The other women supported me and I felt brave to&#13;
    speak out. Everybody listened; they took me seriously.â&#128;&#157;&#13;

The level of womenâ&#128;&#153;s participation in Rekompak increased significantly in Aceh once&#13;
women-only meeting were established, a lesson taken forward to housing reconstruction&#13;
in Java. Only the CDD projects (KDP, KRRP, UPP, Rekompak) under the MDF and JRF did&#13;
this. The other projects relied on special training sessions for women or maintained&#13;
joint men and womenâ&#128;&#153;s meetings.&#13;

                participation of poor and marginalized women. Large scale infrastructure projects,&#13;
                like Rekompak, KDP, UPP, and KRRP with ambitious infrastructure delivery targets,&#13;
                did not have the flexibility, time and extra resources to reach and involve poorer and&#13;
                isolated women meaningfully in decision-making processes. In Aceh, for example, the&#13;
                normal planning cycle (in non-disaster areas) for KDP was shortened to enable faster&#13;
                delivery of much-needed assistance. This compromised facilitation processes and led&#13;
                to lower participation levels and involvement of the poorest women. Big infrastructure&#13;
                projects do have possibilities to coordinate interventions with smaller organizations&#13;
                with the remit and capacities to work with marginalized women. However, there were&#13;
                few examples of this kind. KDP was an exception. It used off-budget non-MDF funds&#13;
                to support a complementary Programâ&#128;&#148;PEKKAâ&#128;&#148;which worked exclusively with poor,&#13;
                vulnerable and marginalized widows (see box bellow). This enabled both projects to&#13;
                work to their strengths and bring a greater number of poorer women into community&#13;
                planning processes. However, other large scale infrastructure projects such as Rekompak&#13;
                could not take advantage of this linkage. Their village selection criteria, requiring that&#13;
                they were the sole large scale housing project, while aimed at avoiding duplication,&#13;
                forced PEKKA to exit villages where the bigger housing projects worked. While overall&#13;
                more houses were built, the unintended consequence was that the most vulnerable and&#13;
                marginalized were unnecessarily excluded.&#13;
&#13;
                The lesson for future reconstruction processes is that formalized partnerships and&#13;
                linkages to address gaps in delivery to women is a smart investment. It improves project&#13;
                outcomes and opens up space for strengthening the role of women in the overall&#13;
                reconstruction process.&#13;

                     Strengthening Support for Poor and Highly Vulnerable Widows&#13;
&#13;
                     In Aceh, the Program for Women Headed Households in Indonesiaâ&#128;&#148;PEKKAâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
                     offered KDP a complementary approach to large scale infrastructure programs&#13;
                     and providing a route for highly vulnerable women to begin to exercise their&#13;
                     voice in public, including in community planning processes. Funded directly by&#13;
                     the Japan Social Development Fund, it was implemented and linked into the KDP.&#13;
                     With over 1,200 members in Aceh, the project aimed not only to provide micro-&#13;
                     credit for small businesses and scholarships for child education, but also training&#13;
                     in vocational and leadership skills. The aim was to empower highly vulnerable&#13;
                     women in Aceh. These women were already often marginalized within their&#13;
                     own communities and, post-tsunami, were becoming more marginalized with&#13;
                     the implementation of Shariah law. PEKKA had a clear focus on empowering&#13;
                     women, not just economically through livelihood support, but also socially. From&#13;
                     the start, PEKKA had the aim of ensuring that a â&#128;&#156;rightsâ&#128;&#157; perspective was equally&#13;
                     valued alongside the projectâ&#128;&#153;s other development goals.7&#13;

                      us. We helped a bit.... We talked about what we wanted with our husbands and&#13;
                      they represented us at community meetings. We never had a separate meeting for&#13;
                      women, or if there was, we never heard about it.â&#128;&#157; The women did not feel they&#13;
                      had an active role in reconstruction and worried that they were ill-prepared for the&#13;
                      future. â&#128;&#156;We would have liked to be involved in community settlement planning,&#13;
                      but there wasnâ&#128;&#153;t any and no, we didnâ&#128;&#153;t have any evacuation drill training.... It would&#13;
                      help; if we know what to do we can help protect our families, ourselves and our&#13;
                      communities. If we donâ&#128;&#153;t know what to do we will just panic.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
                      The remoteness of the village, coupled with a short time frame for reconstruction,&#13;
                      undermined the amount of time Rekompakâ&#128;&#153;s facilitators could give to community&#13;
                      facilitation or supporting womenâ&#128;&#153;s involvement. Equally, the village leadership&#13;
                      had little interest in actively involving women. The 30 percent target for womenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                      representation in project meetings and the requirement that a woman was included&#13;
                      in the leadership team were viewed as conditions that had to be met in order to&#13;
                      get external support. As they admitted: â&#128;&#156;They [women) donâ&#128;&#153;t talk much [at the&#13;
                      meetings] and itâ&#128;&#153;s more important they attend community meetings when there&#13;
                      are issues important to them like child health.â&#128;&#157;9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                   techniques for addressing equity between women and reaching marginalized women.&#13;
                   There is also no way of knowing precisely how far most projects were able to reach&#13;
                   and include poor and marginalized women as project monitoring systems, even when&#13;
                   indicators were sex disaggregated, as project monitoring systemsâ&#128;&#153; did not track wealth&#13;
                   or social differences between different groups of women.&#13;
&#13;
                   Gender sensitive accountability: Accountability is not gender neutral. Women and&#13;
                   men use different strategies and mechanisms to raise concerns or hold projects to&#13;
                   account. Hotlines, texting complaints and complaint boxesâ&#128;&#148;the standard methods&#13;
                   of formal complaintâ&#128;&#148;are more problematic for women. Partly this is because their&#13;
                   access to information is more limited. Women much more than men were uncertain of&#13;
                   their rights to hold projects to account, make complaints, or seek redress. A review of&#13;
                   accountability mechanisms in the MDF reported that most women, particularly poorer&#13;
                   and disadvantaged women, were unaware that complaint boxes or hotlines existed.10&#13;
                   Cultural norms and expectations of womenâ&#128;&#153;s role in communities also prevented women&#13;
                   from vocalizing their concerns.&#13;

implementation processes, will have very different outcomes. In these circumstances,&#13;
as the story of two villages in the box featured illustrates, women may be involved,&#13;
but as passive beneficiaries rather than active decision-makers and shapers of project&#13;
interventions. The challenge for projects is in addressing the social and gender dynamics&#13;
which cause these disparities. A number of lessons emerged from the experiences of&#13;
the MDF and JRF:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Context specific gender analysis is essential to support projects to develop and tailor&#13;
   their facilitation processes. This is because it helps identify drivers for and barriers&#13;
   against, womenâ&#128;&#153;s participation and develop context-specific strategies. Only KDP and&#13;
   UPP consistently undertook context-specific analysis and adjusted their strategies.&#13;
   UPP, for example, after early difficulties in engaging with women post-tsunami, began&#13;
   to post their community facilitators within communities to enable closer contact and&#13;
   rapport building with all sections of communities.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Invest in staff capacities to facilitate womenâ&#128;&#153;s empowerment processes in challenging&#13;
   contexts. Investing in the capacities of community facilitators was recognized as one&#13;
   of the most valuable expenditures for effective implementation. In all projects,&#13;
   greater investment in the form of support and mentoring was given to the hard&#13;
   skills â&#128;&#147; engineering, business development and marketing for example â&#128;&#147; rather than&#13;
   the soft skills of engagement and facilitation. In practice the balance tipped towards&#13;
   facilitating the delivery of outputs and away from the process of empowerment. Both&#13;
   are equally important and require appropriate investments. Gender training and&#13;
   sensitization were not followed up with supervision, coaching and monitoring, which&#13;
   undermined the steps made towards enhancing the quality of facilitation processes.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Flexible budgetary mechanisms enable pro-active responses to disparities in levels of&#13;
   participation. In the large infrastructure projects such as the CDD programs or TRWMP&#13;
   that operated through government, it became clear that front-line government staff&#13;
   follow rules and guidelines set nationally; they do not have the mandate to reallocate&#13;
   resources or staff to address disparities in implementation plans or build capacities to&#13;
   address implementation weaknesses. In Aceh for example, implementation challenges&#13;
   in Aceh Besar â&#128;&#147; including engaging women participants â&#128;&#147; were much higher than in&#13;
   Pidie. Levels for womenâ&#128;&#153;s participation in Aceh Besar fell well below the 30 percent&#13;
   target. However, KDP could not move more staff into Aceh Besar or alter the time&#13;
   allotted for mobilization for each community without parliamentary approval. Off-&#13;
   budget support to the PEKKA program was one solution.&#13;
&amp;#12;         66&#13;
                                                                                    Ensure womenâ&#128;&#153;s equal rights to participation in Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR)&#13;

The key lesson from MDF and JRF is that strengthening womenâ&#128;&#153;s voice and agency&#13;
in community planning requires focused and active facilitation. Setting targets,&#13;
encouraging women to be present and to speak promotes increased involvement of&#13;
women but is insufficient to encourage decision making and leadership in reconstruction&#13;
processes. Longer time for mobilization, robust support systems for facilitators and&#13;
investments in identifying and overcoming the barriers to womenâ&#128;&#153;s participation are all&#13;
needed, if women are to be empowered to engage meaningfully in reconstruction.&#13;

WOMENâ&#128;&#153;S ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT:&#13;
INCREASING ACCESS TO&#13;
RECONSTRUCTION BENEFITS AND JOBS&#13;

                      Typically, in disasters menâ&#128;&#153;s access to the benefits of reconstruction is greater than&#13;

                                                                                                                     More Than Mainstreaming: Promoting Gender Equality and&#13;
                      womenâ&#128;&#153;s. Women are less likely to receive direct government or donor assistance in&#13;
                      their own right, normally receiving benefits as part of a household. Menâ&#128;&#153;s livelihood&#13;
                      recovery is also given higher priority than womenâ&#128;&#153;s. Through gender stereotyping the&#13;
                      types of jobs available are held to be menâ&#128;&#153;s work: housing, road building; infrastructure&#13;
                      development generally benefits more men than women. Men are likely to be more&#13;
                      mobile, moving away from their home area to seek job opportunities; womenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                      household and reproductive duties restrict their ability to seek work.1 In consequence,&#13;
                      womenâ&#128;&#153;s economic empowerment is compromised and they recover more slowly from&#13;
                      the economic impacts of disaster.&#13;
&#13;
                      The story is not that different for post-disaster Aceh, Nias and Java. Livelihood gains were&#13;
                      modest and economic insecurity increased with the highest economic losses faced by&#13;
                      already poor and economically insecure women. In Aceh, for example, more than 80&#13;
                      percent of men had recovered paid employment by 2008, while less than 50 percent of&#13;
                      women of working age were earning income in the agriculture or other sectors of the&#13;
                      cash economy.2 In Yogyakarta and Central Java, poor women, over-represented in low-&#13;
                      profit home-based industries, suffered the double loss of their homes and livelihoods&#13;
                      after the earthquake. Poverty levels increased in both Aceh and Nias while nationally&#13;
                      poverty levels were decreasing. Rural women working on family farms lost one of their&#13;
                      few income earning opportunities, sometimes for years, because of land degradation&#13;
                      post-tsunami. Women headed and orphan-headed households were significantly&#13;
                      impoverished with least access to work or income earning opportunities.3&#13;
&#13;
                      Despite the modest gains for womenâ&#128;&#153;s economic security post-disaster, there were some&#13;
                      successes across the projects within the MDF and JRF portfolios in empowering women&#13;
                      through access to infrastructure and livelihood opportunities. This section explores the&#13;
                      range of tangible benefits women gained from their involvement in the MDF and JRF&#13;
                      community and livelihood recovery projects. There were two distinct areas in which&#13;
                      women benefited:&#13;

                     â&#128;¢	 Economic Empowerment â&#128;&#147; access to jobs, income, housing, equipment, materials,&#13;

                      marketing, and on womenâ&#128;&#153;s rights and gender. Production of the emping has&#13;
                      increased eight fold since the start of the project in 2010. The membership has&#13;
                      grown to nearly 200 members. Job opportunities for women are few in this part&#13;
                      of Aceh. The Koperasi has given women choices, allowed them to build a business&#13;
                      and start to diversify their livelihoods. Small loans are also given to individual&#13;
                      women to start their own businesses such as small food stalls, shops and selling&#13;
                      clothes. Incomes have risen from about IDR 300,000 to IDR 500,000, or around&#13;
                      $30 to $50 per month. Women acknowledge they benefit from far more than just&#13;
                      the business opportunities:&#13;

                            â&#128;&#156;I only got as far as junior high school; now I feel I am&#13;
                            getting an education. There were many projects that came&#13;
                            after the tsunami. This one was different. It gave us lots of&#13;
                            information, lots of meetings for women. We had lots of&#13;
                            training and support. And we gained hope for the future.&#13;
                            Women are starting to know their rights, to speak out. Life&#13;
                            has changed for the betterâ&#128;&#157;.6&#13;

                 Income, skills and capacities for women in non-traditional work areas increased&#13;
                 significantly. The two ILO road projectsâ&#128;&#148;CBLR3 and RACBP, as well as the CDD projects&#13;

                   The Women of An-Nisa&#13;
&#13;
                   The women of An-Nisaâ&#128;&#153;Wal Athfal meet every day in three locations across Aceh&#13;
                   Barat, one of the areas of Aceh worst affected by the disaster. These women&#13;
                   gather to make handicrafts from recyclable material such as coconut fiber,&#13;
                   cloth, and pandanus leaves. An-Nisa is much more than simply a business to sell&#13;
                   handicrafts; it brings together disadvantaged poor women to improve their lives&#13;
                   and the lives of their families. These foundation in Acehâ&#128;&#153;s west coast was selected&#13;
                   for support under the MDFâ&#128;&#153;s Tsunami Recovery Waste Management Program&#13;
                   (TRWMP) and implemented through TRWMPâ&#128;&#153;s partner, Terre des Hommes.&#13;
&#13;
                   â&#128;&#156;Our focus is on the housewife,â&#128;&#157; said Dasni Husin, founder and executive director&#13;
                   of An-Nisaâ&#128;&#153;Wal Athfal. â&#128;&#156;No one is concerned for them. We give them knowledge&#13;
                   and training so they can help themselves.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
                   Today, orders are pouring in for the handicrafts. Coconut fiber mats are their&#13;
                   most popular item, but pandanus leaves tissue boxes come in a close second.&#13;
                   The demand was so great for the handicrafts that the women have opened a new&#13;
                   store with a prominent showroom and visibility in the community.7&#13;

               Opening up new space for women in the cash economy and non-traditional areas of&#13;
               work. The new job opportunities for women in all three regions were few (e.g. waste&#13;
               recycling, roads maintenance and brick making). Most livelihood opportunities for&#13;
               women centered on their traditional domestic roles such as handicrafts, snacks and&#13;
               cake production.8 Projectsâ&#128;&#148;particularly the EDFF in Aceh and LEDP in Nias, could&#13;
               have supported more activities that open up new spaces in the cash economy and&#13;
               non-traditional areas of work for women. In Aceh, for example, the post-tsunami&#13;
               housing boom provided women with less than half of one percent of their livelihood&#13;
               opportunities. In Nias, the only sector which saw more than a rise of one percent in&#13;
               job growth for women was the service sector.9 Infrastructure and housing were two&#13;
               areas where potentially jobs for women could have been created; building on their&#13;
               involvement in community infrastructure projects. RACBPâ&#128;&#153;s site supervisorsâ&#128;&#153; training&#13;
               for road construction and maintenance on Nias offers one successful example. It was&#13;
               targeted at both young women and men, but 50 percent of the applications were&#13;
               women, demonstrating a clear interest by women for work in a non-traditional area.&#13;
               However, less than 30 percent of the final trainees were women; the rest failed to meet&#13;

&#13;
                       â&#128;&#156;Any innovative activity requires at least two or three years of&#13;
                       support upfront before starting on serious business development,&#13;
                       compared with something people have done all their lives... We&#13;
                       underestimated the socialization; we underestimated the time it&#13;
                       would take.â&#128;&#156;11&#13;

                 Looking forward, the lessons from Aceh, Nias and Java suggest that livelihood recovery&#13;
                 interventions for women with the potential to progress economic empowerment and&#13;
                 sustain gains need to:&#13;
                 â&#128;¢	 Start early within six months post disaster and develop incrementally;&#13;
                 â&#128;¢	 Be based on a gender-focused livelihood analysis, and have defined gender end&#13;
                    objectives and exit strategy;&#13;
                 â&#128;¢	 Focus initially on building confidence, skills and knowledge; and&#13;
                 â&#128;¢	 Expand activities in phases over a five to seven year time frame, distinguishing&#13;
                    between recovery, strengthening economic security and developing sustainable&#13;

                 Protecting womenâ&#128;&#153;s land and property rights: The institution of joint land titling was an&#13;
                 important step towards establishing womenâ&#128;&#153;s land rights as central to gender equitable&#13;
                 reconstruction processes. Overall in Aceh, close to 30 percent of land titles were issued&#13;
                 solely or jointly to women, although the number was much lower in some areas.12 The&#13;
                 environment was highly challenging in Aceh. As a consequence of 30 years of conflict,&#13;
                 there was a deep distrust of government institutions and their legitimacy especially in&#13;
                 relation to tenure and land ownership. The situation was compounded programmatically&#13;
                 by limited gender-sensitization, no gender mainstreaming strategy and no initial analysis&#13;
                 of the gendered nature of land and tenure regimes in Aceh which prevented RALAS from&#13;
                 capitalizing on the opportunities for strengthening womenâ&#128;&#153;s land rights post-disaster.&#13;

                Womenâ&#128;&#153;s active involvement in the building of their house contributed to the healing&#13;

                particularly serious, exacerbating psycho-social stress. The denial of rights, voice and&#13;

                men.16 In Java, where most women have more decision-making power in the home than&#13;
                in public life, the loss of home is significantly disempowering. Being actively involved in&#13;
                the design and building of their homes through Rekompak helped the healing process,&#13;

                On an individual level, some women indicated that earning income through infrastructure&#13;
                and livelihoods projects led to greater respect and social empowerment within the&#13;
                household. It gave them confidence to demand more time for their work and activities&#13;

                significantly. Women in infrastructure projects did not generally perceive that their&#13;
                social standing in communities had changed either positively or negatively. The short&#13;
                time frame for the projects and limited follow-up may be contributing factors. Women&#13;
                who had moved through reconstruction onto livelihood recovery projects noted positive&#13;
                impacts on their social status. Women waste pickers, some of the poorest and most&#13;
                marginalized women in Aceh who graduated from cash-for-work to developing small&#13;
                businesses in waste recycling, valued the increased social standing. Participation in the&#13;
                project had brought greater respect from men and the wider community members.&#13;
                Women participants of the CCA cooperatives sub-project of EDFF, which supported&#13;
                women through loans, training and business development, reported a similar story.&#13;
&#13;
                     â&#128;&#156;Before, I was just one of the women; nobody knew me. Now,&#13;
                     within the cooperative men and women have equal rights. Our&#13;
                     ideas are more acceptable to everyone; we can go and talk to the&#13;
                     village leaders and to the cooperative department. People know&#13;
                     who I am; they respect me. I feel proud.â&#128;&#157;&#13;

                In the JRF livelihood recovery programs, womenâ&#128;&#153;s involvement could lead to greater&#13;
                public recognition from local government, the village leadership and community&#13;
                members. In a GIZ livelihoods recovery project working in a remote village to help&#13;
                women develop a snack business, participation had linked the women into the district&#13;
                development forum and led to them become respected members of their community.&#13;
                However, women involved with some of the micro-credit groups with limited training&#13;
                and follow-up reported no change in their social status.&#13;
&#13;
                Building community resilience to future disaster was enhanced through DRR. Women&#13;
                are more conscious than men of the need for DRR and are prepared to invest significantly&#13;
                in disaster preparedness in order to protect themselves and their families.17 In all three&#13;
                regions, women involved in DRR activities perceived opportunities to learn practical&#13;
                measures for disaster preparedness as a significant benefit. Women, for example, were&#13;
                more responsive than men towards acknowledging the importance of earthquake safe&#13;
                construction practices and willing to invest their time and resources into applying these&#13;
                principles.18 In Java, women saw the community settlement plans (see box following) as&#13;
                a collective asset which contributed to greater security and peace of mind.&#13;

               Infrastructure, housing and economic development projects in post-disaster situations&#13;
               generally do not incorporate strategies and actions aimed at addressing the impacts&#13;
               of trauma. Usually it is special projects or health and education programs which&#13;
               integrate counseling and other support activities into their work.22 Rebuilding houses&#13;
               did undoubtedly support the healing process and the longer timeframe that Rekompak&#13;
               took in mobilizing and supporting community members enabled both men and women,&#13;
               to some extent, to identify their own level of engagement. However, by not actively&#13;
               addressing the impacts of psycho-social stress there were missed opportunities to&#13;
               identify small incremental steps that could overcome the specific barriers created by&#13;
               stress that inhibited womenâ&#128;&#153;s active involvement.&#13;

               Two projects did actively respond to womenâ&#128;&#153;s trauma and adjust their implementation&#13;
               strategies to enable participants to benefit fully from the activities: DRR-Aceh and the&#13;
               CCA-supported PESAT under the EDFF. CCAâ&#128;&#153;s work was funded in two phases. In the first&#13;
               phase of 4 years (funded by CIDA) CCA, mindful of the high levels of psycho-social stress,&#13;
               focused on peace building, counseling and sensitization activities. Slowly, starting with&#13;
               small savings and loans groups, it was able to build the trust, confidence and emotional&#13;
               security of participants to re-engage with profitable livelihood activities. Only in the&#13;
               second phase of its work, funded by the MDF, did it begin supporting major economic&#13;
               development for women through cooperative development. There are lessons for future&#13;
               infrastructure and economic development interventions. Building a response to alleviate&#13;
               the impacts of psycho-social trauma into a project will require extra time and resources.&#13;
               However, better understanding of the psycho-social impacts of disaster will help identify&#13;
               respectful and sensitive starting points for different and incremental levels of support.&#13;
               Failure to do so will lead to the most affected women self-excluding and undermine the&#13;
               potential benefits for both the women involved and the regional economy.&#13;

                                                                                                                   More Than Mainstreaming: Promoting Gender Equality and&#13;
                     lessons about the capacities, support structures, systems and mechanisms necessary&#13;
                     to promote gender equality and womenâ&#128;&#153;s empowerment in future reconstruction&#13;
                     processes. To do so necessitates two inter-related actions:&#13;
                     â&#128;¢	 Making gender equality a full objective in post-disaster reconstructionâ&#128;&#148;that is,&#13;
                         identifying interventions that progress gender equality and empower women&#13;
                         economically or increasing womenâ&#128;&#153;s agency, and&#13;
                     â&#128;¢	 Mainstreaming gender concerns throughout the DRR process from response to&#13;
                         reconstructionâ&#128;&#148;that is, establishing the systems, mechanisms and processes that&#13;
                         enable a gender equality perspective to be operationalized.&#13;
&#13;
                     Indonesia took a major step forward in national disaster-preparedness with the&#13;
                     publication of the Post-disaster Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Guideline (2010) and&#13;
                     the Indonesia Post-Disaster Needs Assessment Guideline (2011). Included within these&#13;
                     guidelines is the requirement to address the socio-economic impacts of disaster on&#13;
                     women and men during the initial needs assessment process. However, they both fall&#13;
                     short in providing guidance on how to operationalize this requirement or mainstream&#13;
                     gender in to disaster preparedness and response: a lacuna that needs to be addressed&#13;
                     for effective operations in future disasters. Aside from contributing to international best&#13;
                     practice, these lessons from MDF and JRF may provide the basis for the development of&#13;
                     a national gender-sensitive operation manual.&#13;
&#13;
                     Based on the experiences of the MDF and JRF, this section highlights practical ways in&#13;
                     which an institution can make sure that men and women are involved before, during and&#13;
                     after disasters happen.&#13;
&#13;
                     Good practice is being added to all the time, and work indicates three main routes to&#13;
                     take to bring gender issues to the forefront of disaster management.1&#13;
&#13;
                     These include:&#13;
                     Focusing â&#128;&#147; involving men and women equally when preparing for disaster, responding&#13;
                     while a disaster is occurring, and in the rebuilding process after it has passed.&#13;

   administration. This provides a shared understanding, often missing in international&#13;
   or non-local staff and organizations, of the cultural and social norms which determine&#13;
   gender roles and, how agencies can work with these norms to promote womenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
   active participation.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Establishing a global pool of disaster-focused gender experts. More investment is&#13;
   needed in developing a global pool of operational gender experts who can provide&#13;
   advice on what needed to be done to ensure the lessons already known are&#13;
   implemented. Practically, this requires the technical experts with the knowledge,&#13;
   seniority and experience to, for example: develop indicators to track increases in&#13;
   womenâ&#128;&#153;s agency; influence procurement processes; influence and refine operational&#13;
   manuals; and develop gender-sensitive mechanisms which fit with and support&#13;
   existing sectoral and administrative procedures and systems.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Developing open-source sector-wide and theme based gender analyses as early as&#13;
   possible post-disaster. These analyses, developed for use by all implementing agencies,&#13;
   are complementary to the damage and loss assessments. Sector-based analyses can&#13;
   inform early recovery and reconstruction across the whole sector and initiate the&#13;
   transition links from recovery through to development. For example, identifying the&#13;
   different roles, responsibilities, needs and barriers to participation of women, men,&#13;
   boys and girls in relation to housing or waste recovery and management. The results&#13;
   of the analyses support better coordination and linkages between different sector&#13;
   interventions. Thematic analysis provide the opportunity of addressing cross-cutting&#13;
   issues such as the psycho-social impacts of the disaster on women, men, girls and&#13;
   boys or assessment of interventions supporting womenâ&#128;&#153;s economic empowerment.&#13;
   The results of this can support adaptations to a range of sectoral projects especially&#13;
   in the infrastructure sector, which does not normally make use of non-technical&#13;
   thematic analyses to inform project design.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Including gender focus in technical review of project proposals. Future reconstruction&#13;
   projects will be greatly strengthened by technical reviews providing realistic and&#13;
   concrete gender appraisals, including operational strategies giving clear examples&#13;
   of what can be done to support gender-based outcomes. Some examples are:&#13;
   strengthening womenâ&#128;&#153;s role in decision-making, performance and outcome indicators&#13;
   for tracking womenâ&#128;&#153;s empowerment or gender-sensitive tracking of accountability&#13;
   mechanisms. A review of operations manual prior to project start is also required,&#13;
   embedded in the designed gender principles and strategies within operations.&#13;

   to sustain and maintain new assets.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Faster recovery of local economies and productivity gains â&#128;&#147; Women made up over&#13;
   40 percent of the workforce working largely in small and medium enterprises and in&#13;
   agriculture (often unrecognized as unpaid family labor). Strengthening their skills&#13;
   and talents to actively participate in livelihood recovery helped accelerate economic&#13;
   regeneration. In Java, nearly 50 percent of the of the JRF livelihood recovery supported&#13;
   enterprises were managed by women contributing to GOIâ&#128;&#153;s revitalisation of the local&#13;
   economy.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 More representative decision-making â&#128;&#147; Womenâ&#128;&#153;s active participation in local&#13;
   decision-making processes increased social cohesion and made local institutions more&#13;
   representative of a range of voices. The active involvement of women in community&#13;
   planning changed policy, leading to the increase in provision of public goods such as&#13;
   water, sanitation and health clinics, all of which mattered more for women.&#13;
â&#128;¢	 Enhanced community resilience - Increasing womenâ&#128;&#153;s emotional, physical and&#13;
   livelihood security through active involvement in reconstruction, community&#13;
   settlement planning, livelihood recovery and DRR paid dividends for national and&#13;
   local resilience to future disaster. Women gained the competencies, knowledge and&#13;
   skills to cope and mitigate against losses, vital in situations where there are high levels&#13;
   of male out-migration, such as central Java, or Aceh during the post-tsunami housing&#13;
   boom.&#13;
&#13;
The experience of promoting womenâ&#128;&#153;s equality and empowerment was uneven in the&#13;
MDF and JRF reconstruction processes, all providing lessons for the future. A range of&#13;
good practice examples emerge from the two programs. At the same time, processes&#13;
and mechanisms for actively involving women in decision making and implementation&#13;
could have been better institutionalized. Barriers to womenâ&#128;&#153;s involvement are generally&#13;
high, but the costs of ignoring gender in disaster reconstruction are potentially&#13;
enormous in terms of overlooked damages, needs and priorities that exacerbate&#13;
poverty and inequalities. Understandably, the focus of reconstruction was on reaching&#13;
large numbers of beneficiaries and on deliverables: houses built, infrastructure&#13;
rehabilitated, small businesses revived. While necessary and important, this focus too&#13;
often overshadowed the potential for and development of qualitative improvements in&#13;
womenâ&#128;&#153;s empowerment.&#13;
&#13;
The key lesson from the MDF and JRF is that promoting gender equality and womenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
empowerment requires active facilitation at every level: the international aid community,&#13;
national and local government, projects and communities. Policy prescriptions and&#13;
encouraging women to be present and speak are not enough. Post-disaster gender&#13;
equity needs additional investment and support: this is not just a moral obligation; it is,&#13;
quite simply, â&#128;&#156;smart economicsâ&#128;&#157;. As good practice lessons from the MDF and JRF project&#13;
experiences show, when women are active participants in reconstruction with a voice to&#13;
shape the design and management of reconstruction, there are better quality outcomes&#13;
for everyone.&#13;

       The framework of analysis informing the working paper on the role of women in reconstruction&#13;
       study is underpinned by three interlinked components.&#13;
&#13;
       1.	 Non-discrimination and Equity of Access are fundamental rights guaranteed for women&#13;
           and men in Human rights Law to which Indonesia and its donor partners were signatories1.&#13;
           This component explores the extent to which, and how, MDF and JRF Programs were able&#13;
           to promote fair and equitable access for women to their services and benefits during the&#13;
           reconstruction phase. It focuses on what lessons can be learned about the approaches and&#13;
           strategies used by projects to enable women to fulfill their rights, take part and benefit&#13;
           from the interventions.&#13;
&#13;
       2.	 Participation, voice and accountability: Community participation was a prominent feature&#13;
           of the MDF and JRF programmatic support: the majority of its supported programs included&#13;
           some element of community consultation. The extent to which women survivors are able to&#13;
           participate in the decision-making, management and development of projects has a major&#13;
           impact on the form their role takes in reconstruction and their levels of satisfaction with&#13;
           reconstruction efforts.2 This component explores the extent to which womenâ&#128;&#153;s voices were&#13;
           heard and responded to by MDF and JRF projects as well as how and at what levels;&#13;
           (policy making; management, field, beneficiaries) projects were accountable their women&#13;
           constituents.&#13;
&#13;
       3.	 Inclusion of women and in particular, vulnerable and disadvantaged women: Attention to&#13;
           the social inclusion of all women, irrespective of their status, ethnicity, levels of disadvantage&#13;
           and vulnerability is vital to the effectiveness and sustainability of reconstruction processes.&#13;
           Reconstruction efforts, by overlooking and directly discriminating against women can&#13;
           perpetuate and even reinforce existing patterns of vulnerability and disadvantage.3 The&#13;
           final component looks at the systems, mechanisms and processes that the MDF and JRF and&#13;

â&#128;¢	 validating information through field visits to selected communities in Aceh, Nias and Java&#13;
   to conduct participatory interest group discussions with a range of women and men.&#13;
&#13;
 A total of 25 participatory interest group discussions (19 with women, 6 with men) were held&#13;
involving 207 women and 92 men who had been involved in either infrastructure projects&#13;
(housing, road rehabilitation and village infrastructure) or livelihood recovery projects. The&#13;
objective of the field visits was neither research nor evaluation but a chance to listen to, and&#13;
learn from, the insights provided by women, and men, of their experiences as participants of&#13;
MDF and JRF Programs.&#13;

            More than mainstreaming : promoting gender
            equality and empowering women through post-disaster reconstruction
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Multi Donor Fund for Aceh and Nias
            (MDF) and the Java Reconstruction Fund (JRF) have played
            significant roles in the remarkable recovery of Aceh, Nias
            and Java, following some of the worst disasters in Indonesia
            in recent years. The MDF and the JRF, which is patterned
            after it, are each considered a highly successful model for
            post-disaster reconstruction. This paper presents lessons
            from the MDF and JRF's efforts to facilitate
            women's empowerment and gender equality during the
            reconstruction process. The reconstruction process presented
            opportunity to address gender issues and other social
            inequalities. Enhancing the role of women under the MDF and
            JRF programs saw significant results, such as improved and
            sustained outcomes in housing and infrastructure, faster
            economic and livelihood recovery and increased productivity,
            strengthening of women's legal rights, more
            representative decision making and enhanced resilience for
            women and communities.
