11.      PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION&#13;
A. Objectives&#13;
1.       The project will contribute to the national development goals of the Interim Afghanistan&#13;
National Development Strategy (I-ANDs) of maintaining Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)&#13;
prevalencebelow 0.5 percent inthe generalpopulationand below 5 percent amongvulnerable groups&#13;
at high risk of infection. The project's development objectives are to slow down the spread of HIV&#13;
and build up the national capacity to respond to the epidemic. This will be accomplished by: (a)&#13;
behavior change among vulnerable groups at high risk; and (b) improving knowledge of HIV&#13;
preventionand reducingstigmarelatedto HIV and (AcquiredImmunodeficiencySyndrome) AIDS in&#13;
the generalpopulation.&#13;
2.       The key performance indicatorsthat will be usedto track the projectdevelopment objectives&#13;
are:&#13;
&#13;
         (a) the percent of injectingdrug users who have adoptedbehaviors that reducetransmission&#13;
              of HIV, that is, who useclean injectingequipment at last time injecting;&#13;
&#13;
         (b) the percentof sex workers who reportusinga condom with their mostrecentclient; and&#13;
&#13;
         (c) the percent of young people aged 15-24, in areas covered by the project, who correctly&#13;
              identifyways of preventingHIV transmission.&#13;
&#13;
B. Description ofProjectComponents&#13;
&#13;
Component 1: Communicationsand Advocacy&#13;
&#13;
3.       This component will strengthen the advocacy and communication capacity of the National&#13;
AIDS Control Program (NACP) to create a policy environment that enables scaling up of targeted&#13;
interventionsfor vulnerable populationsat highrisk, and reduces stigmaand discriminationrelatedto&#13;
high risk behaviors. Specifically, informedadvocacy among policymakersand opinion leaders will&#13;
aim to reduce stigma and harassment of vulnerable populationsand have leaders: (a) appreciate the&#13;
threat of HIV to Afghanistan; (b) better understand the actions that can prevent a full-blown HIV&#13;
epidemic; (c) becomeeffective sources of informationfor the rest of the community; (d) take actions&#13;
themselves to assist their communities to avoid HIV; and (e) provide continuous support for the&#13;
AIDS control program.It has been agreed that a national policy statement with commitment to the&#13;
principlesof confidentialityand the voluntary nature of HIV testingwill be inplace at the start ofthe&#13;
project, and that during the course of the project, appropriate substitution treatment policy for&#13;
injecting drug users (IDUs) will be developed. The communications activities, including behavior&#13;
change communicationand media activitiesdescribedbelow, will increase access to informationand&#13;
appropriate knowledge of HIV prevention and other related health issues for vulnerable groups at&#13;
highrisk, includingsex workers and their clients, truckers, andyouth in areas covered by the project.&#13;
The behavior change interventionswill includea focus on the use of clean needles and syringes, and&#13;
on condom use among IDUs and their partners; on consistent condom use among sex workers and&#13;
their clients; and, on appropriateknowledge about HIVtransmission andways ofpreventingit among&#13;
all vulnerable populationsat risk.&#13;
&#13;
4.       Activities will include (a) target audience research; (b) development of an advocacy strategy&#13;
and activities such as high level meetings, training, and disseminationof evidence-based advocacy&#13;
informationpackages;(c) development of core training and informationpackagesfor target audiences&#13;
for use by service providers; (d) specific communication trainingfor Non Government Organizations&#13;
(NGO) service providers, journalists, private practitioners and others; (e) gender- and culturally&#13;
&#13;
                                                   2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
appropriate communication media targeting vulnerable persons at risk; (f)audience surveys; and (g)&#13;
reporting. To ensure a coherent approach and complementarity o f activities, one organization will be&#13;
contracted to develop the plan and implement all elements o f the communication and advocacy&#13;
component under the coordination and guidance o f the National AIDS Control Program (NACP).&#13;
&#13;
Component2: StrengtheningofHIV Surveillance&#13;
&#13;
5.       This component will build the evidence base for HIV and AIDS planning and help monitor&#13;
and evaluate the effectiveness o f the program. Itwill buildNACP capacity to track the magnitude and&#13;
trajectory o f the HIV epidemic in Afghanistan through the development o f second generation&#13;
surveillance (SGS) system. The SGS system includes separate mapping and size estimation o f at risk&#13;
populations, collection o f biological data from representative samples of the populations, and tracking&#13;
the behaviors that contribute the most to HIV transmission dynamics. Based on the current&#13;
understanding o f the epidemic, these behaviors are injecting drug use and unsafe sex. In addition to&#13;
providing data for monitoring o f the epidemic, the wide array o f knowledge, behavioral, and service&#13;
utilization data collected through SGS will provide the basis for future resource allocation and&#13;
program management decisions to be made by NACP. All the SGS data will therefore be owned by,&#13;
and readily available to, the NACP, and generated on an intermittent or routine basis, and not subject&#13;
to the same internal review processes put in place for research and special studies. All surveillance&#13;
activities involving HIV testing will follow the standard confidentiality and voluntary testing&#13;
procedures o f the voluntary confidential counseling andtesting (VCCT) sites.&#13;
&#13;
6.       Epidemiologically relevant data in Afghanistan remain scarce; however some recent studies&#13;
o f at risk populations will be used to refine the selection o f survey groups and locations for the&#13;
baseline round o f the surveillance activities. As the baseline round o f surveillance data become&#13;
available, adjustments and potential expansions o f the surveillance sites and target populations will be&#13;
made as needed to more appropriately monitor the epidemic. Likewise, the preliminary targets&#13;
established by the program (see results framework) will be adjusted based on available data.&#13;
&#13;
7.       The SGS activities will be implemented by an organization selected through international&#13;
competitive bidding.This organization will work with the National AIDS Control Program (NACP),&#13;
guided by an HIV Surveillance Working Group (H-SWG), to train its staff to conduct surveillance,&#13;
obtain all necessary test kits and other materials, provide timely reports, and disseminate findings.&#13;
The surveillance firm is given explicit responsibility for conducting national level capacity building&#13;
on SGS methods and providing thorough documentation on the design and execution o f the various&#13;
studies. The terms o f reference for surveillance include: (a) an initial desk review o f currently&#13;
available information about location and size o f at risk populations, including characterization with&#13;
respect to patterns o f mobility and intersection with other risk groups; (b) annual mapping and size&#13;
estimation o f at risk populations in urban centers (up to 8 sites every second year or twice during the&#13;
duration o f the project); (c) integrated biological and behavioral surveys (IBBS) o f IDU, female sex&#13;
worker (FSW), prisoners, and truckers using probability based methods conducted twice during the&#13;
Program Implementation Plan (PIP) period; (d) two rounds o f Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices&#13;
( U P ) surveys o f mainstream opinion leaders to assess the effectiveness o f the advocacy and&#13;
communication component; (e) annual data synthesis and epidemic modeling o f available&#13;
surveillance and other data to project the impact o f the epidemic onthe overall country scenario.&#13;
&#13;
8.       Due to the importance o f obtaining baseline measures for the core program indicators in order&#13;
to measure project results, the data collection activity for the IBBS o f IDU, SWs, and prisoners&#13;
should be completed within the first 6-9 months o f the project. The early development o f service&#13;
quality standards and guidelines for different program components will also ensure that the survey&#13;
instruments are specific and relevant to the program being implemented.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Component3: Targeted Interventionsfor HighRiskBehaviors&#13;
&#13;
9.       This component will support targeted interventions(TIS)to prevent further spread of HIV&#13;
amongvulnerable groups at highest risk (see Appendix 5 for definitionof TI packages). The TISwill&#13;
support safe practices and reduce risky ones. The targeted intervention for HIV preventionamong&#13;
IDUs provides a comprehensive harm reduction package, including needle and syringe exchange,&#13;
peer counselingand education, and condompromotion,deliveredat drop incenters andthrough other&#13;
outreach services. The services will be delivered where HIV transmission is most likely to occur,&#13;
basedon mappingof highrisk populationsand sero prevalence survey data, with flexibility to expand&#13;
to new sites as they are identified. Proposals will be invited from NGOs for work with identified&#13;
groups, such as IDUs and their partners, sex workers and their clients, and others as appropriate in&#13;
selected sites startingwith the major urban areas. InKabul, due to the estimated size and spread of&#13;
mainly street based IDUs, there will be three contracts covering different parts of the city and&#13;
surroundingareas, while inthe other three cities with surrounding areas (Herat, Jalalabad andMazar)&#13;
there will be one contract for each area. NGOs will provide the services under contract with the&#13;
Ministry o f Public Health(MOPH). The Grants and Contracts Management Unit (GCMU) will have&#13;
the managerialand financial responsibilitiesandtheNACPwill providethe technicalsupervision.&#13;
&#13;
10.      The terms of reference (TOR) for targeted interventions for IDUs, sex workers and their&#13;
clients, truckers and prisoners will include (a) gathering of baseline data to estimate the size of the&#13;
populationto be covered, on a case by case basis, taking into account local data needs and the data&#13;
that is already available through social mapping; (b) establishment and operation of appropriate&#13;
services such as, inthe case of HIV preventionamong IDUs, drop in centers (DIC), social support,&#13;
needle and syringe exchange, condom distribution, sexually transmitted infections (STI) care, other&#13;
medicalsupport, andVCCT; and(c) reporting.The contracts for IDUswill target groups in four cities&#13;
and their surrounding areas with flexibility to expandto new sites each following year basedon data&#13;
showingadditionalsites (hot spots) with concentrationof personswith highrisk behaviors.There will&#13;
be only one contract each for HIV prevention among truckers, sex workers and their clients, and&#13;
prisons.Procurementof this will be basedon competitivebidding.The prisonprogramand one ofthe&#13;
IDU TISwill include operations research to assess the feasibility of alternative options for effective&#13;
substitutiontherapy, to informnationalpolicy to be developed on substitutiontherapy. Ethnographic&#13;
study will be conducted to learn more about MSMnetworks and how to design appropriate strategies&#13;
for reachingMenwho have Sex with Men(MSM)with HIV preventioninterventions.&#13;
&#13;
Component 4: ProgramManagement,CapacityBuilding,Monitoringand InnovationActivities&#13;
&#13;
11.      This component will strengthen the core functions of the national HIV/AIDS prevention&#13;
program, including program management, capacity development, and monitoring by NACP and the&#13;
multi sector HIV oversight o f the HIV/AIDS Coordinating Committee o f Afghanistan (HACCA).&#13;
This component will also provide funding of innovativeapproaches - an "Innovation Initiative" for&#13;
mainstreamingof the national multi sector HIV response.Membership of HACCA is extensive and&#13;
includesNGOs and civil society representatives as well as ministrieslisted below. Capacity building&#13;
activities in this component will facilitate learning and include exposure visits, short term TA,&#13;
training, including training of health services providers, and conferences leading up to policy&#13;
development and review. The NACP will be supported though six national advisors, the program&#13;
manager, and an international advisor - two of the national advisors will support the GCMU on&#13;
financing and procurement. The Project will support NACP office operations and transport for&#13;
monitoringand supervisionactivities, includingregular (monthly) visits to activity sites throughout&#13;
the country.&#13;
&#13;
12.      This component will support the development of routine monitoring and service quality&#13;
assessment, closely aligned with the existing Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) and Health&#13;
&#13;
                                                  4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Management Information System (HMIS) o f the MOPH, and including an action plan, timeline, and&#13;
assigned responsibilities to the M&amp;E advisor and other NACP staff. Standardized, routine monitoring&#13;
indicators and formats will be developed for each program area. The principles and operations o f&#13;
routine monitoring for NACP will be consistent with established practices o f the larger MOPHM&amp;E&#13;
and HMIS system for Basic Package o f Health Services/Emergency Project Health Services facilities.&#13;
This includes emphasis on local units reviewing and analyzing their own data for program&#13;
management purposes. In a few program areas, where other ministries or other M O P H departments&#13;
(e.g., Ministry o f Counter-Narcotics (MOCN) or the M O P H demand reduction unit) play a role in&#13;
managing NACP supported or externally funded activities, it will be critical to obtain consensus on&#13;
routine monitoring standards and requirements so that NGOs receiving funds from multiple donors&#13;
follow a single standard, and data can be analyzed across various types o f implementation units.&#13;
&#13;
13.     The Innovation Initiative for multi sector mainstreaming will invite proposals from sectors&#13;
other than health. The Innovation Initiative will enable other line ministries, NGOs and the private&#13;
sector to develop action plans in support o f the project development objectives, through a&#13;
memorandum o f understanding with the MOPWNACP (line ministries) and through NGO contracts&#13;
managed by the MOPWGCMU. This will enable innovative HIV prevention activities, for example&#13;
among women, youth, refugees and returnees, and other initiatives to reduce stigma in different&#13;
population groups. The grants under the Innovation Initiative will include: (a) baseline (if available);&#13;
(b) appropriate innovation activity for an agreed target group in an agreed location; (c) monitoring&#13;
and evaluation plan; and (d) reporting. The first round may cover several contracts for different&#13;
audiences and/or target groups. The second and third round may extend these contracts and/or add&#13;
contracts for additional audiences and/or target groups.&#13;
&#13;
14.     ProjectCosts. The estimated cost o fthe project with contingencies is about US$lO.O million&#13;
over three years. The project costs summary and cost breakdowns by components are described in&#13;
more detail inAppendix 1.&#13;
&#13;
111.    IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
A. InstitutionalArrangements&#13;
&#13;
15.     The project will be implemented over a three year period by the MOPH. The institutional&#13;
framework is in place, assigning the program coordination, management and technical roles to&#13;
MOPWNACP and the financial management and procurement responsibilities to the MOPWGCMU,&#13;
under the overall multi sector oversight o f HACCA. Technical working groups are being established&#13;
(Le,, HIV Surveillance WG) by the NACP to guide its work program, drawing on available technical&#13;
experts from professional, academic, research or other organizations within the country. These&#13;
technical working groups will support and report to NACP, which in turn will present the&#13;
recommendations o f the technical working groups to the H A C C A for endorsement. The M O P H will&#13;
contract the surveillance and communications components o f the project to agencies that can carry&#13;
out those functions while developing and transferring capacity in these areas. The targeted&#13;
interventions for the prevention of HIV among IDUs, sex workers and their clients, truckers and&#13;
prisoners will be contracted to NGOs and Community-based Organizations (CBOs) with experience&#13;
inworking with the communities at risk.Non-health ministries, private sector and NGOswill be able&#13;
support or implement HIV prevention programs, funded through the Innovation Initiative, by&#13;
preparing proposals to be reviewed by a multi sector review panel led by the NACP, and reporting to&#13;
the HACCA. Specifically, the roles ofthe NACP, GCMU and HACCA are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
16.     National AIDS Control Program will lead the implementation o f the proposed project, in&#13;
close coordination with relevant departments within MOPH, Le., Reproductive Health, Mental&#13;
Health/Drug Demand Reduction, Information, Education and Communication (IEC), Environmental&#13;
&#13;
                                                   5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Health, and M&amp;E Departments and with key non-health sectors. The targeted intervention activities&#13;
will be contracted out to NGOs and CBOs. Working with NGOs and CBOs in the prevention,&#13;
treatment and care o f HIV and AIDS is international best practice, and will: (a) facilitate access and&#13;
use o f preventive services among vulnerable groups at highest risk through peer educators and other&#13;
outreach strategies; (b) ensure the protection o f communities at highest risk; and (c) help sustain the&#13;
program among communities at risk. The strengthening o f surveillance and the communications&#13;
components will also be contracted to organizations with experience in carrying out and building&#13;
capacity inthese areas. MOPHhas a good track record o f implementing the Health Sector Emergency&#13;
Reconstruction and Development Project, which includes the NGO-contracting approach to service&#13;
delivery. In fact, civil society involvement is even more relevant to HIV prevention efforts, because&#13;
the vulnerable population groups are particularly difficult to reach through governmental channels&#13;
and need to be involved for effective coverage and quality. The proposed multi sector Innovation&#13;
Initiative under AHAPP will be managed by the MOPH, reporting to HACCA. A multi sector review&#13;
board, chaired by the NACP, will approve proposals from non-health sectors, through the Innovation&#13;
Initiative.&#13;
&#13;
17.      The NACP capacity will be strengthened. NACP is currently staffed by a Program Manager,&#13;
an international advisor (supported by the project), and four officers, most o f whom need to further&#13;
their skills and expertise in HIV/AIDS program management. The NACP i s in the process o f&#13;
recruiting a total o f six national advisors to help build NACP and G C M U capacity in the following&#13;
areas: (a) monitoring and evaluation; (b) advocacy and communication; (c) IDU interventions; (d)&#13;
interventions for other vulnerable populations; (e) procurement; and (f') accountant/financial&#13;
management. The NACP team will focus on the monitoring, coordination, quality control and&#13;
management o f various activities proposed by the AHAPP, while the GCMU, which has a strong&#13;
track record o f handling project financing and procurement, will manage those aspects o fthe project.&#13;
&#13;
18.      HIV/AIDS Coordination Committee of Afghanistan (HACCA) has been established by&#13;
M O P H to ensure a broad-based and inclusive oversight mechanism. This multi sector committee is&#13;
chaired by the Deputy Minister for Technical Affairs o f MOPH, and includes the participation o f key&#13;
ministries, agencies from public and private sectors, civil society and external development partners.&#13;
HACCA will have eight provincial representatives (representing all 34 provinces) and two&#13;
representatives o f people living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHAs) to guide the national Program&#13;
Operational Plan (POP) and the Project Implementation Plan (PIP), a subset o f the POP, and begin a&#13;
deeper involvement o f various sectors and partners. HACCA will play a critical role inthe process o f&#13;
developing a national policy on HIV/AIDS to be endorsed by key ministries and parliament,&#13;
including support to the principles o f confidentiality and voluntary testing and the protection o f&#13;
vulnerable groups at highrisk from stigma and discrimination.&#13;
&#13;
19.      Grants and Contracts Management Unit. The Head o f the accounting department for&#13;
G C M U in MOPH will manage the financial transactions o f the program, such as the preparation o f&#13;
M-16 forms (payment orders), coordination with other line ministries involved in the program, and&#13;
overall contract and project management. This department is staffed with financial management (FM)&#13;
personnel who are efficiently managing all current external grants including the (International&#13;
Development Association (IDA) Health Sector Project. A qualified and experienced procurement&#13;
specialist and an accountant are being recruited by MOPH to strengthen the financial management&#13;
and procurement capacity o f GCMUto handle the additionalwork related to the AHAPP.&#13;
&#13;
B. FinancialManagement,Disbursementand Audit Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
20.      An Afghanistan's Public Finance Management (PFM) performance rating system has&#13;
recently been developed for Afghanistan by the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability&#13;
(PEFA) multi-agency partnership program, which includes the World Bank, International Monetary&#13;
&#13;
                                                    6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Fund (IMF), EC, and other agencies. Afghanistan's ratingsagainst the PFM performance indicators&#13;
portray a public' sector where financial resources are, by and large, being used for their intended&#13;
purposes as authorized by a budget that is processed with transparency and has contributed to&#13;
aggregatefiscal discipline.&#13;
&#13;
21.     Financial management and audit functions for the proposed project will be undertaken&#13;
throughthe agents contractedunder the Public AdministrationCapacityBuilding project.This is the&#13;
primary instrument for continuing to strengthen the fiduciary measures put in place for ensuring&#13;
transparency and accountability of funds provided by the Bank and other donors. Under these&#13;
contracts, two advisers-Financial     Management and Audit-are       responsible for working with the&#13;
government and line ministriesto carry out these core functions. The FinancialManagement Agent&#13;
(FMA) is responsiblefor helpingthe Ministry of Finance(MOF) maintainthe accounts for all public&#13;
expenditures, including IDA-financed projects and for building capacity within the government&#13;
offices for these functions.&#13;
&#13;
22.     At the project level, financial management will be coordinatedby the NACP through the&#13;
GCMU of MOPH. The financial management capacity in GCMU, which has experience in the&#13;
managementof Bank projects, will be strengthenedby the recruitmentof an additionalqualified and&#13;
experiencedaccountant.&#13;
&#13;
23.      Quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports will be prepared by the NACP/GCMU/MOPH&#13;
accountingunit. Consolidated projectreports will be prepared, reviewed, and approved by the MOF,&#13;
supportedby the FMA.&#13;
&#13;
24.      A DesignatedAccount (DA) with a ceilingof US$500,000 will be opened at DaAfghanistan&#13;
Bank (DaB, Central Bank) in the name of the project on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
The DA will be maintained by the MOF. Withdrawal applications for reimbursement will be&#13;
submittedmonthly.Financialmanagementarrangementsfor the project are detailedinAppendix 4.&#13;
&#13;
Fund Flows&#13;
&#13;
25.      Fund management for the Project will follow existing procedures. As with all public&#13;
expenditure, all payments under the project will be routed through MOF. The FM Agent will assist&#13;
the MOF in executing and recordingproject payments. In keepingwith current practices for other&#13;
projects in Afghanistan, the DA will be operated by the Special Disbursement Unit (SDU) in the&#13;
Treasury Department MOF. Requests for payments from DA funds will be made to the SDU by&#13;
MOPH. In addition to payments from DA funds, MOPH can also request the SDU to make direct&#13;
payments to contractors, consultants or consulting firms, and to request issuance of special&#13;
commitments for contracts covered by letters of credit. Such requests will follow World Bank&#13;
procedures. All withdrawal applications to IDA, including reimbursement, advances, special&#13;
commitment and direct payment applications, will be prepared and submitted by MOF.&#13;
GCMUMOPH will prepare statements of expenditures based on suggested formats given by the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Accountingand Reporting&#13;
&#13;
26.      A Financial Management Manual will be prepared by MOPH documentingthe financial&#13;
management arrangements for the project, including detailed arrangements and procedures for&#13;
payments and reporting for those that will benefit from the InnovationInitiative. The manual will&#13;
outline guidelines for project activities including specific requirementsfor line ministriesinvolvedin&#13;
the program, and establish a project financial management system in accordance with standard&#13;
Afghan government policies and procedures. This will include use of the Chart of Accounts&#13;
&#13;
                                                    7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
developedby the FMA to recordproject expenditure. Projectaccounts will be consolidatedcentrally&#13;
inMOF, throughthe SDUand supportedby the FMA. ConsolidatedProjectFinancialStatementswill&#13;
bepreparedfor all sources anduses of projectexpenditures.&#13;
&#13;
InnovationInitiative&#13;
&#13;
27.      An amount ofUS$l,OOO,OOO     is to be set aside from the projectfunds for innovativeactivities&#13;
that will strengthen multi-sector responses from government departments, community NGOs, and&#13;
privatef m s accordingto the project'sresults framework and essentialpackagesof services.Budgets&#13;
for the InnovationInitiative will form part of the total project budget for MOPH which will be the&#13;
responsible line ministry for the expenditures incurred, irrespectiveofthe benefitinglineministry.&#13;
&#13;
28.      Disbursements for proposals approvedby the multi sector reviewBoardunder the Innovation&#13;
Initiativewill requiresignedperformanceagreements(Le., MOlJsfor line ministriesandcontractsfor&#13;
community NGOs and private firms) between the MOPH and the recipient institutions. The&#13;
performance agreements will delineate each party's responsibilities, record procedures for&#13;
procurement and financial management, and containa copy of the approvedfundingproposal.Itwill&#13;
also define performance milestones in project implementationthat, when verified, serve as triggers&#13;
for the release of additionalpayments, after the initial tranche payment made based on the proposal.&#13;
For NGOs and CBOs, IDA is financingthe sub-grant on either a lump sum or tranched basis, with&#13;
MOPH doing detailed monitoring of actual expenditures of sub-grant funds. For other Line&#13;
Ministries,IDA is financingthe procurement contracts (for works, goods, services) awardedandthus,&#13;
doing actual expenditure monitoring and requiring expenditures (use of sub-grant proceeds) to be&#13;
providedvia either records (supportingdocumentation) or reports of statement ofexpenses(SOEs).&#13;
&#13;
29.      Forfinancial reportingfrom recipientinstitutions, reports will be submitted quarterlyor at the&#13;
time of request for funds tranche release, whichever is earlier. The reports shall consist of financial&#13;
and physicalprogress. MOPHwill designcommonreportingformats or templates, inorder to enable&#13;
it to assemble financial information from a number of participating institutions into an aggregate&#13;
reportfor onward submission to the Bank (as part ofthe quarterly interimun-auditedprojectfinancial&#13;
reports). Detailsandformats wouldbe includedinthe project's financialmanagementmanual.&#13;
&#13;
DisbursementMethod&#13;
&#13;
30.      Disbursements from the IDA grant will be in accordance with the Bank's Disbursement&#13;
Handbook for World Bank Clients and include advances reimbursement, direct payment, and&#13;
payments under Special Commitments including records (full documentation) or against summary&#13;
reports(statementsof expenditures), as appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
Audit ofProjectFunds&#13;
&#13;
3 1.     The Auditor General, supportedby the Audit Agent, is responsible for auditingthe accounts&#13;
of all IDA-financedprojects. Annualauditedproject financial statementswill be submittedwithin six&#13;
monthsofthe close ofGoA's fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
C. ProcurementArrangements&#13;
&#13;
32.      Procurementactivitieswill be carried out by the MOPHthroughthe GCMU.&#13;
&#13;
33.      Procurementwill be in accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under&#13;
InternationalBank for Reconstructionand Development(IBRD)Loans and IDA Credits" (datedMay&#13;
&#13;
                                                   8&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2004; revised October 2006); "Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank&#13;
Borrowers" (dated May 2004; revised October 2006); and the provisions stipulated in the&#13;
Development Grant Agreement. The Bank's Standard Bidding Documents, Requests for Proposals,&#13;
and Forms o f Consultant Contract will be used. In case o f conflictlcontradiction between the Bank's&#13;
procurement procedures and any national rules and regulations, the Bank's procurement procedures&#13;
will take precedence. The summary o f the procurement capacity assessment o f the implementing&#13;
agencies and precise arrangements are presented inAppendix 3,&#13;
&#13;
D. MonitoringandEvaluationArrangements&#13;
&#13;
MonitoringArrangements&#13;
&#13;
34.      M&amp;E o f the national program will be NACP's responsibility, in cooperation with the M&amp;E&#13;
department o f MOPH, and aligned with the HMIS. The project will strengthen the capacity o f the&#13;
NACP to monitor program implementation and evaluate progress towards the national HIV&#13;
development goal, which is to keep national HIV prevalence below 0.5 percent among the general&#13;
population and below 5 percent among the population groups with highrisk behaviors. Strengthening&#13;
o f surveillance is a major component o f the project, since sero-prevalence and behavioral data are&#13;
critically needed to inform policy, priorities and decision making. As part o f evaluation, the project is&#13;
also considering support for a feasibility study o f piloted harm reduction interventions, to strengthen&#13;
the evidence base for the most effective, feasible and appropriate substitutiontherapy options in the&#13;
Afghanistan context. Other special studies include an ethnographic survey o f M S M and analysis o f&#13;
the relationship between injecting drug use, poppy cultivation and counter narcotics policies. These&#13;
evaluation data and special studies will supplement the routine monitoring system, which will collect&#13;
and analyze data, contributing to, and using a compatible database platform as the existing M O P H&#13;
HMIS system.&#13;
&#13;
35.      The project results framework (Section 1) was developed to ensure consistency between the&#13;
PIP and the broader POP, and linkingproject components and major actions with expected outcomes.&#13;
A checklist for the policy assessment index is being prepared to identify core policy issues necessary&#13;
to create an enabling environment for HIV/AIDS control programs to be effective in Afghanistan.&#13;
The checklist i s intended to award credit for partial achievements in advocacy considering the&#13;
substantial effort required to pass policy and legislation. Scoring i s determined objectively according&#13;
to whether policies are in place and supportive follow-up actions to enforce or apply such policies&#13;
have occurred.&#13;
&#13;
36.      The ongoing social mapping o f high risk groups and the surveys o f sero-prevalence and&#13;
behavioral determinants among those and other groups (University o f Manitoba and University o f&#13;
California San DiegoNAMRU-3 respectively) will provide some results by mid 2007 and help build&#13;
a baseline for the project. The ongoing exercise is also building skills in the country to map highrisk&#13;
groups, skills essential for implementation and monitoring.&#13;
&#13;
37.      Project Monitoring will be carried out at different levels. At the level o f NACP, the Manager&#13;
would conduct quarterly reviews with NACP staff and implementation partners (NGOs, CBOs, non-&#13;
health line ministries that draw from the multi-sector fund and academic or research institutions that&#13;
would carry out research studies). At the level o f MOPH, the Deputy Minister for Technical Affairs&#13;
would conduct regular biannual reviews. HACCA will also review the progress o f project&#13;
implementation at Annual Review meetings, including all development partners. A routinely&#13;
collected set o f monitoring data and service quality assessments will comprise the basis o f these&#13;
reviews. The specific indicators in both these sets will reflect the terms o f reference o f the program&#13;
component, and the guidelines/operations manual developed for use by the implementationagencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38.      Evaluation would be o f two types: (a) project evaluation, which would be carried out at the&#13;
end o f the project; and (b) assessment o f the feasibility o f pilot activities planned under the project.&#13;
The former would depend on baseline data, largely collected through the first round o f the planned&#13;
SGS activities, at the beginning o f the project period; routine monitoring data and periodic progress&#13;
reports through the life o f the project, a process monitoring based mid-term review 18 months into the&#13;
project's life and an end-line measurement o f achievements. Feasibility studies o f pilots would be&#13;
carried out by robust scientific methods, and would be built into the respective pilots themselves, in&#13;
order to determine the programmatic effectiveness and feasibility o f each intervention being tested,&#13;
and to learn lessons for incorporation incase the pilot intervention is deemed fit for scaling up.&#13;
&#13;
IV.      ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFEGUARDPOLICIES&#13;
&#13;
A. EnvironmentalAssessment&#13;
&#13;
39.      Provision o f preventive and diagnostic services under the HIV/AIDS project is expected to&#13;
benefit the health situation in Afghanistan, however, it could generate infectious bio-medical wastes&#13;
such as sharps (infected needles and syringes, etc.), infected blood, HIV test kits used in Voluntary&#13;
Counselling and Testing (VCT) centers and laboratories and pharmaceutical wastes. These wastes, if&#13;
not managed and disposed properly, can have direct environmental and health implications.&#13;
&#13;
40.      This project has been classified as category "B" as per the World Bank's Operational Policy&#13;
on Environmental Assessment (OP 4.0 1) for environmental screening purposes given the risks&#13;
associated with the handling and disposal o f medical waste and general health waste. Category B&#13;
projects imply that the potential adverse environmental impacts o f the program are site-specific and,&#13;
in most cases mitigatory measures can be designed readily and appropriately. An Environmental&#13;
Management Plan, including an Infection Control and Waste Management (IC-WM) Plan has been&#13;
developed by NACP which focuses on the establishment o f a sound management system for the&#13;
treatment and disposal o f the waste related to the testing, treatment and prevention o f HIV/AIDS/STIs&#13;
and includes generic guidance and protocols and alternative technologies for treatment, transportation&#13;
and disposal in accordance with the size o f healthcare facilities. The details o f the Environmental&#13;
Management Planare described in a separate Addendum to the TA.&#13;
&#13;
B. Safeguard Policies&#13;
&#13;
41.      This project has triggered OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment due to the potential adverse&#13;
environmental impacts o f healthcare waste as discussed in the previous section. A limited&#13;
environmental assessment was undertaken by different stakeholders and included consultations and&#13;
field visits to some government run and some NGO run facilities. NACP does not have the necessary&#13;
institutional capacity to implement the I C - W M Plan and will need to obtain appropriate support for&#13;
components such as training, IEC and monitoring. An external independent evaluation is&#13;
recommended before the midterm review o f the program, to ensure all activities are on track. It is the&#13;
responsibility o f the NACP o f the MoPH to make the final version o f the Infection Control and Waste&#13;
Management Plan (to be disclosed in the World Bank InfoShop) available to all relevant national&#13;
stakeholders inthe local languages as well as on the relevant websites.&#13;

                            Appendix2: Economicand FinancialAnalysis&#13;
&#13;
ProjectRelationto AfghanistanDevelopmentContext&#13;
The project is well situated within the overall development context of Afghanistan as expressed inthe&#13;
InterimAfghanistan NationalDevelopment Strategy (I-ANDS)and inthe "Afghanized" MDGtargets&#13;
and indicators.&#13;
The I-ANDS. One main pillar o f the I-ANDSis to improve the well-being o f the poor through social&#13;
protectionas well as to mainstream cross-cutting issues ingender. The project approach to HIV/AIDS&#13;
prevention and control will necessarily be cross-cutting due to the multi-sectoral nature of the&#13;
response to this disease. Furthermore, HIV/AIDS presents a major economic shock for infected&#13;
individuals and their families and preventing infections i s an important form of social protection.&#13;
Costs of treatment for illness, and especially the death o f a household member, may push otherwise&#13;
economically robust households into poverty (Wagstaff, 2005). One recent study from Vietnam&#13;
estimated that, with the exception of households inthe richest quintile, all households with a PLWHA&#13;
will fall below the poverty line as a result of the income and expenditure effects of HIV/AIDS&#13;
(United Nations Development Program D D P ] , 2004).&#13;
&#13;
The project focus on targeted interventions (e.g., harm reduction programs) and advocacy efforts&#13;
reflects another major theme of the I-ANDS. This theme looks to strengthen protection of human&#13;
rights for all and assure redress for violations. Attempts to reduce the social stigma of, and provide&#13;
health services to, at risk and vulnerable groups will have the additional advantage of improving the&#13;
human rights situation for these socially marginalizedgroups.&#13;
&#13;
The "Afghanized" MDGs. The "Afghanized" MDGs, as they relate to HIV/AIDS, aim to halt and&#13;
reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2020 and the MDG monitoring includes monitoring of the&#13;
condom use rate, the percent of the adult population with knowledge o f HIV/AIDS, and the HIV&#13;
prevalence rate among groups at high risk. The MDGtargets also include the proportion of injecting&#13;
drug users intreatment by 2015. Project activities will contribute to all o fthese outcome measures.&#13;
&#13;
Justification for GovernmentFinancing&#13;
&#13;
Public financing o f the project is justified because of the positive externalities associated with&#13;
preventing HIV transmission and because of the public goods nature o f advocacy and other&#13;
communication efforts, the establishment of a second-generation HIV surveillance system, and the&#13;
piloting of treatment programs among vulnerable groups at high risk.Equity considerations are also&#13;
relevant as part of the overall economic justification for the project; as suggested above the&#13;
microeconomic impact of HIV infection on households is severe. An additional important externality&#13;
of the project arises as a consequence of a reduction in the incidence of HIV/AIDS - an expected&#13;
corresponding reduction in opportunistic infectious and costly diseases such as pulmonary&#13;
tuberculosis will further reduce the burden on households and the Afghan health system. Given the&#13;
public health nature of the interventions supported through the project andtheir large externalities, the&#13;
GOAhas a central role insupportingactivities inthis area.&#13;
&#13;
EconomicAnalysis&#13;
The project will fund activities in three broad HIV related components: (a) harm reduction programs&#13;
and other behavioral interventions (including behavior change communication (BCC) focused on&#13;
reducing stigma and discrimination) that aim principally to reduce the transmission of HIV; (b) the&#13;
establishment of a second generation surveillance system; and (c) policy and program development&#13;
on a pilot basis, including substitution treatment for IDUs. Each of these three components will be&#13;
discussedseparately inthis economic analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Harm Reduction Activities&#13;
&#13;
The cost effectiveness o f reducing HIV transmission has been demonstrated in numerous global&#13;
settings. These findings are partly due to the simple fact that the disease largely affects prime age&#13;
adults and the associated costs o f an adult death constitute the key microeconomic impact o f the&#13;
HIV/AIDS epidemic. Over the course of the disease, household labor quality and quantity are&#13;
reduced, initially as the infected person i s less productive, and subsequently with their death. This&#13;
cost o f foregone earnings i s one major microeconomic cost o f the disease. These costs are&#13;
exacerbated when there is more than one infectedperson inthe household, which is not unusual given&#13;
the nature o f transmission. Other major costs include health care needs and the foregone earnings of&#13;
family caretakers.&#13;
&#13;
The general success o f HIV prevention interventions, including harm reduction interventions for&#13;
IDUs, is another reason for its general cost-effectiveness. International and regional evidence,&#13;
including in resource constrained settings, demonstrate HIV prevention programs do indeed reduce&#13;
HIV transmissions (Bertozzi et al., 2006). HIV prevention interventions are most timely -many more&#13;
infections are preventable - in countries where the epidemic is growing rapidly rather than in&#13;
countries where it i s stable or declining. This is the case in Afghanistan where the epidemic i s&#13;
believedto be growing but concentrated in several key sub-groups, mainly IDUs.&#13;
&#13;
IDUshave been the starting point o f the HIV epidemic in many East and South Asian countries and&#13;
the focus o f this project on the reduction in HIV transmission among IDUs as well as across to other&#13;
groups i s well justified. Usingthe Asian Epidemic Model, Saidel et al., (2003) demonstrated that in&#13;
countries where the epidemic among IDUsstarts in advance o f a generalized (non-IDU) heterosexual&#13;
epidemic there i s a 171 percent increase over a 15 year period in infections if IDU prevalence i s not&#13;
kept under control.&#13;
&#13;
The total costs o f the program are well-anticipated, yet the proposed program will occur in an&#13;
environment with other donor supported HIV/AIDS activities coordinated under the National&#13;
Framework and the POP. Bank-funded activities, however, will focus on reducing transmission&#13;
(including the piloting o f substitution therapy) among the groups most urgently requiring&#13;
interventions for the future health o f the country.&#13;
&#13;
Through the targeted interventions, the project will directly benefit socially excluded groups such as&#13;
IDUsand SWs. This is true for harm reduction as stated above. It should also be true for behavioral&#13;
change communication and stigma reduction since changing popular attitudes towards PLWHAs as&#13;
well as attitudes towards vulnerable groups should at the very least increase the effectiveness o f harm&#13;
reduction interventions. As these socially excluded groups find increased social acceptance, at least&#13;
among important contact populations such as health workers, they will be more likely to respond to&#13;
public or NGO sponsored interventions.&#13;
&#13;
The economic analysis here attempts to assess the net impact o f the program's package o f behavioral&#13;
interventions. Towards this goal it adopts a cost-benefit approach couched in the general&#13;
epidemiological patterns observed in Afghanistan's neighbors. This approach i s adopted because,&#13;
largely as a result o f the longstanding conflict, the absence o f a surveillance system on HIV/AIDS in&#13;
the country and current reliance on sporadic and unsystematic data make it very difficult to (a)&#13;
determine the magnitude o f the actual epidemic today; (b) understand the dynamics o f transmission;&#13;
and (c) assess the potential for its further diffusion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                     14&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
However, what information exists suggests a potentialfor rapid increase indiseaseprevalence:&#13;
&#13;
        (a) Countries experiencing war or in complex emergency states, like Afghanistan, are&#13;
             particularly vulnerable to rapid HIV transmission (Wollants et al., 1995; Smallman-&#13;
             Raynor and Cliff, 1991). Factors related to increased transmission during war include&#13;
             poverty, displacement of a population with high HIV prevalence to areas of lower&#13;
             prevalence, and sexual abuse or use of sex as a survival commodity. Additionally,&#13;
             populations within post-conflict states experience psychological effects that lead to&#13;
             increasedriskbehavior.&#13;
&#13;
        (b) Limitedhealth care and education also contribute to the continuation of risk behaviors,&#13;
             particularly among IDUs. Displaced Afghan heroin users exhibit less knowledge&#13;
             regarding HIV transmission and engage in high-risk behavior when compared to&#13;
             Pakistani heroin users (Zafar at al., 2003). A recent study o f 464 IDUs in Kabul found&#13;
             that 35 percent claimed to have ever shared syringes, 76 percent had ever paid for sex&#13;
             with a woman, 27 percent had ever had sex with other medboys, 19 percent had ever&#13;
             been in prison, and 4 percent had ever been paid for donating blood. In this sample 3&#13;
             percent were already HIV sero-positive and 37 percent carried the Hepatitis C virus&#13;
             (Todd et al., 2006).&#13;
&#13;
        (c) Afghanistan is re-emergingas the leading supplier of opium inthe global market. Heroin&#13;
             use is widespread in Afghanistan and though injection i s not a common route of&#13;
             administration traditionally, this is increasing as displaced persons returnto Afghanistan&#13;
             with injection techniques learned in bordering countries (IRINews.org, 2004). UNODC&#13;
             estimates there are 50,000 narcotics addicts in Afghanistan, o f which 7,000 inject. They&#13;
             also estimate that a large number of people are injecting over the counter&#13;
             pharmaceuticals (e.g., pentazocin) which suggests there may be as many as 19,000 IDUs&#13;
             inAfghanistan at risk for acquiringHIV(UNODC, 2006).&#13;
&#13;
        (d) Central and South Asia are experiencing a rapid increase in HIV cases introduced by&#13;
             injection drug use and the commercial sex trade (Joint United Nations Programme on&#13;
             HIV and AIDS [UNAIDS], 2006). Iranhasthe highest rate ofheroinaddiction per capita&#13;
             inthe world: 20 percent of Iranians aged 15 to 60 are engaged in drug abuse 9 to 16&#13;
                                                                                              -&#13;
             percent of whom inject drugs. Twenty-three percent of IDUs in Tehran are HIV positive&#13;
             (Zamani et al., 2006), this is an increase from 15 percentjust one year earlier (Zamani et&#13;
             al., 2005).&#13;
&#13;
The HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Islamic Republic of Iran appears to be accelerating at an alarming&#13;
rate. The Iranian HIV adult prevalence rate in 2001 stood at less then 0.1 percent, roughly where&#13;
Afghanistan stands today. By 2006 there were 66,000 HIV positive adults in Iran, or 0.2 percent of&#13;
the adult population (UNAIDSAVorld Health Organization [WHO], 2006). The Iranian experience&#13;
may be particularly relevant for the future of the epidemic in Afghanistan. A 2005 United Nations&#13;
Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) report found that at least 50 percent of injecting drug users in&#13;
Afghanistan reported to have started in Iran. In addition, the genotype o f the virus identified in a&#13;
recent sero-prevalence study is identical to that found among IDUs in Iran (Todd et al., 2006).&#13;
&#13;
IfAfghanistan were to follow the Iranian example then an increasefrom less than 0.1 percentofthe&#13;
general adult population (15-49) to 0.2 percent over five years represents a minimum o f 16,000 new&#13;
infections (assuming a mortality rate of 15 percent over the next five years for individuals already or&#13;
soon to be HIV-positive). This hypothetical course of the epidemic in Afghanistan serves as the&#13;
baseline progression of the disease for this economic analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The impact o f the project can be modeled as a series o f harm reduction interventions that affect the&#13;
transmission rates within and across vulnerable groups as well as across to the general population.&#13;
The likely impact o f the proposed interventions on transmission is treated as a random variable with&#13;
hypothesized distributions. The analysis then adopts Monte Carlo methods to generate a distribution&#13;
o f anticipated total benefits, at the national level, to compare with costs.&#13;
&#13;
The assumed impact ontransmission of the project inits entirety is set at the deliberately conservative&#13;
expected value o f a 30 percent reduction in expected infections over the period 2007-2010&#13;
(approximately equal to 4800 infections averted). In other words, disease prevalence in the overall&#13;
adult population in five years time would be 0.03 percent less as a result o f the program if the&#13;
trajectory o f the epidemic would have followed the Iranian pattern. To account for heterogeneity in&#13;
project outcomes, we assume a standard deviation o f 25 percent, or 1200 infections averted. In each&#13;
simulation, a new draw o f infections averted is taken from this distribution in order to explore&#13;
benefits o f the project under various levels o f effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
The monetized benefits from a reduced number o f HIV infections are here determined as the sum o f&#13;
three factors: the costs o f medical treatment foregone, the value o f lost earnings for PLWHAs given&#13;
increased mortality, and the value o f lost earnings for the typically familial and unpaid caretakers.&#13;
Table 1 gives the summary cost parameters used inthe analysis. The analysis makes no attempt either&#13;
to directly value the years o f life lost due to premature mortality or to cost the pecuniary savings from&#13;
a reduction intuberculosis and other opportunistic infections transmitted to HIV-negative individuals.&#13;
Clearly, taking these values into account will substantially increase the estimated benefits depicted&#13;
here.&#13;
&#13;
The number o f productive work years lost to premature HIV-related death is assumed to average 20&#13;
years across individuals. Wage and earnings information for Afghan workers are incomplete and&#13;
often o f questionable validity. One careful small-scale longitudinal study conducted in three urban&#13;
centers (Kabul, Herat, Jalalabad) estimates mean annual earnings to be US$425 (Beall &amp; Schutte,&#13;
2006). Since this study spans a 12-month period it includes seasonal spells o f under- and un-&#13;
employment. Approximately 80 percent o f earners are male, so this wage estimate is heavily&#13;
weighted towards male earners. However this may not introduce much bias since the majority of&#13;
IDUs are male and correspondingly many o f the infections in the next few years are expected to be&#13;
male. Real wages are set to grow an average o f 3 percent a year (in-line with economic projections),&#13;
with a standard deviation o f 0.5 percent. This additional source o f variation ensures that every&#13;
simulation will have unique real wage growth rates.&#13;
&#13;
When infected individuals fall sick, they need care and the cost o f foregone earnings for the care-&#13;
takers is another substantial cost. For example in Vietnam, three-quarters o f PLWHAs interviewed in&#13;
a recent UNDP sponsored qualitative study claimed they required the assistance o f a caregiver on&#13;
average for five hours a day. A quarter o f caregivers reported having to give up a job in order to&#13;
spend time with the infected person (UNDP, 2004). This analysis sets the expected earnings loss for&#13;
caregivers at one half o f annual earnings, and this loss occurs in the final year o f life for PLWHAs&#13;
when they are most in need o f homecare.&#13;
&#13;
The expected lifespan, after infection, o f a PLWHA is assumed to be nine years and an enhanced&#13;
level o f health care will be necessary in the final five years, with the final year o f life preoccupied&#13;
with even greater medical care (Zaba et al., 2004). Little information on the costs o f care for&#13;
PLWHAs, both out-of-pocket private expenditures and public sector spending, exists in Afghanistan.&#13;
One linked facility and household survey estimates that 49 percent o f total Afghan health spending&#13;
was out-of-pocket private expenditure (Johns Hopkins Unit, 2006). The same study estimates that the&#13;
average monthly expenditure for a sick adult presenting to a health facility is US$20. This analysis&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        16&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
assumes that after an HIV positive individual begins to suffer from opportunistic infections and falls&#13;
ill,bythe fifthyear ofinfection, s/he willpresentthreetimes annuallyto ahealthfacility, for an&#13;
average private cost o f US$60 a year. The study further assumes an equal amount o f resources in the&#13;
public sector are devoted to that individual's care (since the amount o f spending in the health system&#13;
from private and public sources i s estimated to be roughly equal).&#13;
&#13;
It is to be expected that this level o f care, for the maintenance o f OIs, will be necessary for several&#13;
years, while in the final year the costs are expected to rise substantially. The same UNDP sponsored&#13;
Vietnam study referenced above found that the average per capita health expenditure per PLWHA&#13;
rose seven fold in the final year o f life (UNDP, 2004). This study takes the same multiplier and&#13;
applies it in the Afghan context. Hence, both public and private spending inthe final year o f life for a&#13;
PLWHA averages US$420 each.&#13;
&#13;
The analysis also adopts a discount rate o f 5 percent, a typical value for the evaluation o f health&#13;
projects. Table 2 presents the range o f benefit-cost figures as determined inthe Monte-Carlo analysis.&#13;
The total gross program cost is US$10 million over three years, yielding a net present value o f&#13;
US$9.40 million given the anticipated disbursement schedule. The median present value o f total costs&#13;
averted i s estimated at US$30.8 million, yielding a gross benefit-cost ratio o f 3.28. Indeed almost&#13;
every point in the range o f possible outcomes, depicted in the kernel density plot in Figure 1, i s&#13;
associated with a substantially higher present value o f total costs averted. Inonly one simulation (out&#13;
o f 500) is the estimated gross benefit less than cost. Where gross benefits exceed costs, the benefit-&#13;
cost ratio ranges over the interval (1.16, 6.14).&#13;
&#13;
The median present value o f savings to the healthcare system due to reduced system expenditures on&#13;
PLWHAs is estimated at US$2.04 million, resulting in a net program cost o f US$7.36 million and a&#13;
net benefit-cost ratio o f 4.19. Where net benefits exceed costs (which occurs in 499 out o f 500&#13;
simulations), the benefit-cost ratio ranges over the substantially longer interval (1-25, 9.00). These&#13;
ranges o f gross and net benefit-cost ratios calculated here are consistent with the ratios found in other&#13;
countries in the region, especially when the conservative estimates o f program impact are taken into&#13;
account. Even with these very conservative assumptions on program impact, made in a data scarce&#13;
environment, the anticipated net benefits are substantial.&#13;
&#13;
StrengtheningHIV Surveillance&#13;
&#13;
The cost to Afghan society o f the proposed new surveillance system for HIV/AIDS, which the project&#13;
would support over the first three years o f operation, would be the cost o f establishing the new system&#13;
and subsequently the cost o f operating the system as per its design. This component is currently&#13;
valued at a total cost o f US$1.6 million. Onthe benefits side, the economic benefits that would accrue&#13;
to society from the new HIV surveillance system are those discussed above, namely the costs o f&#13;
medical treatment foregone and the value o f avoided lost earnings for both HIV patients and unpaid&#13;
caretakers.&#13;
&#13;
In practice, estimating distinct benefits as a direct result o f surveillance independent o f the overall&#13;
package o f interventions and investments would be very difficult. Instead the influence o f the new&#13;
system on actual health outcomes is reflected in the analysis above in so far as a functioning HIV&#13;
surveillance system will increase the efficacy and targeting o f harm reduction programs. Indeed ifthe&#13;
surveillance framework does substantially improve the effectiveness o f interventions, then the true&#13;
benefits estimated above may be even greater than depicted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     17&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Nevertheless, there are several dependent processes nested in the establishment and operation o f a&#13;
surveillance system that need be made explicit. For any economic benefits to arise it would be&#13;
necessary that:&#13;
&#13;
        (a)  Competent and qualified personnel are identified and recruited to the organizations&#13;
             charged with establishing and maintainingthe surveillance system.&#13;
&#13;
        (b) The surveillance system collects reasonably accurate information on HIV/AIDS as per&#13;
             its design.&#13;
&#13;
        (c)  Relevant personnel process such information into meaningful reports and ensure the&#13;
             dissemination o f the reports in a timely fashion to those officials in place that are able to&#13;
             utilize them for policy purposes.&#13;
&#13;
        (d) The reports result in effective action taken by the relevant decision makers inthe public&#13;
             or private sectors, which in turn improves the delivery o f services on the ground in a&#13;
             way that results inthe prevention o f a number o f cases o f the disease or a more effective&#13;
             treatment for those already afflicted.&#13;
&#13;
Program design must be such to ensure that these steps are accomplished.&#13;
&#13;
PilotTreatment Programsfor IDUs&#13;
&#13;
The program and policy component o f the project includes the establishment o f harm reduction and&#13;
substitution treatment programs among IDUs. Given the current lack o f such programs, and the&#13;
importance o f IDUs as a group in the transmission o f the disease, the need to develop cost-effective&#13;
procedures to treat IDUs for substance dependency is an important component in GOA'Soverall&#13;
response to the HIV epidemic. The chief economic benefit o f any pilot arises from the externalities&#13;
from learning-by-doing. It i s expected that after several years o f experience with the treatment of&#13;
IDUsGOAwill be able to implement effective substitution treatment programsfor IDUs.Because the&#13;
value o f the pilot lies in the learning opportunities, a formal cost-benefit analysis i s not applicable&#13;
unless the externalities are adequately understood and converted to a monetary value. However the&#13;
analysis notes that the project should ensure as many key preconditions as possible so that the pilot&#13;
exercise will indeed be a valuable learning tool for the GOA.&#13;
&#13;
The key preconditions for a successful IDU drug substitution pilot include the following: thorough&#13;
training and adequate supervision and regulation o f clinic staff; a procurement and distribution system&#13;
that can ensure timely delivery o f medication to groups in need; the medication being included in the&#13;
essential drug list; a M&amp;E system that is able to accurately forecast demand for services and to plan&#13;
accordingly; and effective cross-sectoral cooperation among all involved ministries, including the&#13;
Ministries o f Interior and Justice.&#13;
&#13;
FiscalSustainability&#13;
&#13;
The completion o f the project will bequeath modest recurrent costs to GOA.The estimated recurrent&#13;
costs engendered by the project, listed separately by main areas o f activity, are presented in Table 3.&#13;
&#13;
The burden o f recurrent government expenditures generated by the proposed project is estimated to&#13;
equal US$2,976,000 per year after project completion. The uses o f recurrent expenditures falling to&#13;
the central government include the continuing activities o f national BCC, the continued operation o f&#13;
the HIV surveillance framework, and the on-going harm reduction activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    18&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
This amount is relatively small (2.1 percent) in comparison with the total health sector Government&#13;
spending, which is currently US$140 million per year (including donor support) and expected to&#13;
increase substantially inthe comingyears. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth is projected at&#13;
12 percent in 2007/08 and 10 percent from 2008/09 onwards. In addition, the share of government&#13;
health expenditures in total GDP is expect to increase 40 percent by 2009/10 (IMF, 2006). This&#13;
anticipated growth implies that the inherited recurrent spending will total only 1.2 percent of the&#13;
public sector healthbudgetby 2009/10.&#13;
&#13;
Furthermore, the budgetary impact of the project recurrent expenditures may very well be over-&#13;
estimated. The economic analysis for this project determinedthat the direct costs averted within the&#13;
healthsector as a result of fewer infectionsmay also lessenthe budgetary burden.&#13;

Reconstructionand Development Services (ARDS) that is holding the current responsibility for&#13;
government's procurement administration.As part of the broader review of PFM system, the Bank&#13;
recently carried out an assessment of the procurement environment in the country based on the&#13;
baseline and performanceindicatorsdevelopedby a group of institutions led by the World Bank and&#13;
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)/Development Assistance&#13;
Committee(DAC).&#13;
&#13;
The first key issue identifiedthroughthe procurementassessmentwas the need for ownership and a&#13;
championin the Government for reform, deepeningof capacity, ensuring integrity inthe operation of&#13;
procurement systems, andpromotingsoundprocurement amongministries.&#13;
&#13;
A new procurement law was adopted in November 2005 which radically transformed the legal and&#13;
regulatoryframework for the procurement administrationof Afghanistan.While it provides a modern&#13;
legal system for procurement, effective implementationof the law may encounter difficulties in the&#13;
current weak institutional structure and capacity of the Government. A Procurement Policy Unit&#13;
(PPU) has been established under MOF to ensure the implementation through the creation of&#13;
secondary legislation, preparationof standardbiddingdocuments, provisionof advice and creation of&#13;
the necessary information systems for advertising and data collection. Afghanistan Procurement&#13;
ProcedureshavebeeneffectivesinceApril 12,2007. Proceduresfor ProcurementAppealand Review&#13;
have been developed by PPU/MOF. Members have been appointed and the system has been&#13;
functionalsince April 2007.&#13;
&#13;
In the absence of adequate capacity to manage procurement activities effectively, some interim&#13;
arrangements have been put in place to improve the procurement management of the country. A&#13;
central procurement facilitation service, ARDS, has been established under the supervision of the&#13;
Ministry of Economy.The Bank and the Government have agreed on a program for country wide&#13;
procurement reform and capacity building, leading to the transitionfrom centralizedto decentralized&#13;
procurementservices. The Bank funded Public AdministrationCapacity Buildingproject(PACBP) is&#13;
the primary instrumentfor implementingthe programto strengthen capacity of the line ministries to&#13;
manage public procurement in an effective, transparent and accountable manner. However, the&#13;
implementationof the procurementcapacity buildingstrategy has not made any significant progress&#13;
yet due to lack of coordinationand delays indecision makingwithin the Government.The envisaged&#13;
radicalchanges to the procurementmanagementenvironment expectedfrom the new law also require&#13;
the urgent implementationof a comprehensivehuman resources and capacity development program.&#13;
The implementationof the procurement reform component of the PACBP and the proposed Public&#13;
FinancialManagementReformProject should be consideredwith due priority to ensurethat fiduciary&#13;
standards are further enhanced and that capacity is developed in the Government to maintainthese&#13;
standards.&#13;
&#13;
General&#13;
&#13;
The procurement administration of the project would be carried out in accordance with the World&#13;
Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004, revised&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Operational Costs which would be financed by the project would be procured using the&#13;
implementing agency's administrative procedures which were reviewed and found acceptable to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Assessment of the agency's capacity to implement procurement&#13;
&#13;
Procurement activities will be carried out by the MOPH through GCMU.&#13;
&#13;
An assessment of the capacity of GCMU, the Implementing Agency, to implement procurement&#13;
actions for the project, was carried out by World Bank procurement specialists in December 2006.&#13;
&#13;
The G C M U is a group o f individual consultants established in 2003 to carry out procurement&#13;
activities for the Bank financed Health Sector Emergency Reconstruction and Development Project,&#13;
HSERDP (P078324). The agency is staffed by 30 people and the procurement unit is staffed by four&#13;
procurement officers. One o f the four procurement officers is working on procurement o f health&#13;
sector goods and the three others are busy with hiring and managing consultant contracts under the&#13;
Health Sector EmergencyReconstruction and Development Project.&#13;
&#13;
The procurement specialists responsible for hiring consultants do not have adequate experience. The&#13;
procurement officer working on the procurement o f health sector goods i s involved only with&#13;
procurement o f small contracts (less than US$200,000) o f health sector goods. Big contracts (more&#13;
than US$200,000) o f health sector goods are procured through ARDS. ARDS i s a Government&#13;
Procurement FacilitatingAgency.&#13;
&#13;
As previously indicated, the existing procurement personnel: (a) do not have adequate experience for&#13;
procuring and managing large value contracts; and (b) are fully busy with their procurement activities&#13;
under the Health Project. To mitigate the risk, the following arrangement will be adopted for the&#13;
Project:&#13;
&#13;
         (a)  A competent procurement specialist will be hired under GCMU o f MOPH to procure&#13;
              small value goods, works and consultancy contracts. The procurement specialist will be&#13;
              responsible for     managing procurement for           the  project based on technical&#13;
              specifications/TOR provided by NACP. The procurement specialist, if needed, will also&#13;
              get help from the procurement team already hired under the IDA financed Health Sector&#13;
              Emergency Reconstruction and Development Project (P078324).&#13;
&#13;
         (b) To ensure compliance with World Bank policies and procedures, procurement&#13;
              documentation for complex and large value goods and consultancy contracts will be&#13;
              carried out in consultation with the ARDS.&#13;
&#13;
The overall project risk for procurement is high.&#13;
&#13;
Frequency of Procurement Supervision: In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried&#13;
out from Bank offices, the capacity assessment o f the Implementing Agency has recommended two&#13;
supervision missions to visit the field to carry out post review o f procurement actions. As the overall&#13;
project risk for procurement i s high, 20 percent o f contracts will be post reviewed.&#13;
&#13;
Procurementaudit: In addition to the prior review and post review supervisions to be carried out&#13;
from Bank offices, an independent procurement audit will also take place duringthe project life.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                            Appendix 4: FinancialManagement&#13;
&#13;
Country Issues&#13;
&#13;
The Bank has gained substantial experience and understanding of the financial management&#13;
environment inAfghanistanthroughthe large number of projectsunder implementationover the&#13;
past four years. The PACBP is the primary instrument to continue and enhance the fiduciary&#13;
measuresput in place duringthe past years to help ensure transparency and accountabilityfor the&#13;
fundingprovidedby the Bank and other donors.&#13;
&#13;
A PFM performance rating system using 28 high-level indicators that was developed by the&#13;
Public Expenditureand FinancialAccountability (PEFA) multi-agencypartnership program was&#13;
applied in Afghanistan in June 2005. PEFA is comprised of the World Bank, IMF, EC, and&#13;
severalother agencies.The system is structuredaroundsix core dimensions of PFMperformance:&#13;
(a) budget credibility; (b) comprehensiveness and transparency; (c) policy-basedbudgeting; (d)&#13;
predictability and control in budget execution; (e) accounting, recording, and reporting; and (f)&#13;
external scrutiny and audit. Afghanistan's ratings against the PFM performance indicators&#13;
generally portraya public sector where financial resourcesare, by and large, being usedfor their&#13;
intended purposes. This has been accomplished with very high levels of support from&#13;
internationalfirms; this assistance will continue to be needed over the medium term if these&#13;
ratingsare to be maintained. There is also muchroomfor improvement.&#13;
&#13;
In spite of undeniable gains made in reconstructionsince the end of 2001, the challenges facing&#13;
Afghanistanremainimmense; not least becauseofthe tenuous security situationinthe regionand&#13;
continued prevalence of a large illegal and illicit economy. The policy framework benchmarks&#13;
have not yet been fully costed so various priorities are funded through the annual budgeting&#13;
process. The rising costs of the security sector constitute the major constraint on attainment of&#13;
fiscal sustainability. With regard to executive oversight, the national assembly will play an&#13;
increasinglyactive role.All in all, the new national strategy has created high expectations of the&#13;
executivewhich couldproveto be quite difficult to meet.&#13;
&#13;
The public sector, in spite o f considerable efforts to reform its core functions, remains extremely&#13;
weak outside of Kabul.The lack ofqualifiedstaffinthe civil service andthe absenceof qualified&#13;
counterparts in the government after 30 years of war and conflicts is a bindingconstraint.Delays&#13;
in reformingthe pay structure and grading of civil servants have severely crippled the public&#13;
administration of the country. Domesticrevenues lag behind expenditures by a factor of ten to&#13;
one. Large-scalecorruptioncould emerge to underminethe government's efforts to enhance aid&#13;
flows through national accounts. Capacities to track expenditures and monitor expenditure&#13;
outcomeshave improved, butthey needrapidand substantialstrengtheningifprogresstowardthe&#13;
attainment of nationaldevelopment targets is to be monitored.Currently, 75 percent of external&#13;
revenuesbypassgovernment appropriationsystems.&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank is financing a FinancialManagementAdvisor to assist the Ministry of Finance,&#13;
an Audit Advisor to assist the Control and Audit Office, and a ProcurementAdvisor to assist in&#13;
Procurement-related activities. Also an Internal Audit function is being developed within the&#13;
Ministry of Finance with World Bank financing. USAID, and earlier the IndianAid Assistance&#13;
Program, is financing a team of consultants and advisors to assist the Da Afghanistan Bank in&#13;
local as well as foreign currency operations. The activities carriedout under the existingPublic&#13;
Administration projects have helped the Government to ensure that appropriate fiduciary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               32&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   standards are maintainedfor public expenditures, includingthose supported by the Bank and the&#13;
   donor community.&#13;
&#13;
   Progress has beenslower than expected in shiftingfrom operations support providedby the three&#13;
   Advisors to capacity development and knowledge transfer to the civil servants. Giventhat, it is&#13;
   expected that the Advisors will continue to be required for the medium term. Challenges still&#13;
   remaininattainingthe agreed upon fiduciary standards and also to further enhance them. And to&#13;
   make matters more complex, the regulatory environment in Afghanistan has advanced&#13;
   significantly in the past three years. Unfortunately, even mastery of basic skills in the early&#13;
   environment does not fully qualify the civil servants to work effectively in the new emerging&#13;
   environment.&#13;

Strengths and Weaknesses&#13;
&#13;
Strengths&#13;
&#13;
The Government provides assurance to the Bank and other donors that the measures in place to&#13;
ensure appropriate utilization o f funds will not be circumvented. The Government support for PACBP&#13;
is strength in itself to enhance financial management in Treasury operations, public procurement,&#13;
internal audit inthe public sector, and external audit by the Auditor General. This i s the second IDA-&#13;
funded grant for MOPH so the agency has experience in implementing Bank projects and following&#13;
Bank procedures.&#13;
&#13;
Weaknessesand ActionPlan&#13;
The main weakness in this project, as in many others in Afghanistan, is the ability to attract suitably&#13;
qualified and experienced counterpart staff especially for Financial Management. The additional staff&#13;
to be funded by the project, together with intensive training programs included in this project, is&#13;
expected to strengthen the fiduciary arrangements.&#13;

ImplementingEntity&#13;
The institutional framework i s in place, assigning the program coordination, management and&#13;
technical roles to MOPWNACP and the financial management and procurement responsibilities to&#13;
the MOPWGCMU, under the overall oversight o f the multi sector HACCA. Technical working&#13;
groups are being established (Le., HIV Surveillance WG) by the NACP to guide its work program,&#13;
drawing on available technical experts from professional, academic, research or other organizations&#13;
within the country. These technical working groups will report to NACP, which inturn, presents the&#13;
recommendations o f the technical working groups to the HACCA for endorsement. The MOPH will&#13;
contract the surveillance and communications components o f the project to agencies that can carry&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     35&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
out those functions while developing and transferring capacity in these areas. The targeted&#13;
interventions for the prevention of HIV among IDUs, sex workers and their clients, truckers and&#13;
prisons will be contracted to NGOs and CBOs with experience working with the communities at risk.&#13;
Non-health ministries, the private sector and NGOs will be able support or implement HIV prevention&#13;
programs, funded through the Innovation Initiative, by preparing proposals to be reviewed by a multi&#13;
sector review panel ledby the NACP, and reportingto the HACCA.&#13;
&#13;
Specifically, the roles of the NACP, GCMU and HACCA are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
National AIDS Control Program. NACP will lead the implementation o f the proposed project, in&#13;
close coordination with relevant departments within MOPH, Le., Reproductive Health, Mental&#13;
HealtWDrug Demand Reduction, IEC, Environmental Health, and M&amp;E Departments and with key&#13;
non-health sectors. The targeted intervention activities will be contracted out to NGOs. The&#13;
strengthening of surveillance and the communications components will also be contracted to&#13;
organizations with experience in carrying out and buildingcapacity inthese areas. MOPH has a good&#13;
track record of implementing the Emergency Health Project, which includes the NGO-contracting&#13;
approach to service delivery. In fact, the civil society involvement i s even more relevant to the&#13;
HIV/AIDS prevention efforts, because the vulnerable population groups are particularly difficult to&#13;
reach through governmental channels and needto be involved for effective coverage and quality. The&#13;
proposed multi sector Innovation Initiative under AHAPP will be managed by the MOPH, reporting&#13;
to HACCA. A multi sector review panel, chaired by the NACP, will approve proposals to the&#13;
InnovationInitiative from non-healthsectors.&#13;
&#13;
HIVIAIDS Coordination Committee of Afghanistan. HACCA has been established by MOPH to&#13;
ensure a broad-based and inclusive oversight mechanism. This multi sector committee is chaired by&#13;
the DeputyMinister for Technical Affairs of MOPH, and includes the participation of key ministries,&#13;
agencies from public and private sectors, civil society and external development partners. While&#13;
HACCA ensures multi sector coordination and oversees the broad Program Operational Plan (POP),&#13;
the MOPHhasthe technical lead role, and provides the programmatic accountability for NACP.&#13;
&#13;
Grants and Contracts Management Unit.The head of the accounting department for GCMU inMOPH&#13;
will take responsibility for the financial management activities of the program. GCMU will carry out&#13;
the day-to-day financial management operations of the project, preparation of M-16 forms (payment&#13;
orders), preparation of summary reportshimplified statements of expenditures, coordination with&#13;
other line ministries involved in the program and overall contract and project management. This&#13;
department is adequately staffed with FMpersonnel who are efficiently managing all current external&#13;
grants including the IDA Health Sector Project. However, a qualified and experienced procurement&#13;
specialist and accountant are being recruited by MOPH to strengthen the financial management and&#13;
procurement capacity of GCMU to managethe additional contracts under this project.&#13;
&#13;
Budgeting&#13;
A PlanningCommittee will be appointed to coordinate the preparation o f annual work plans and the&#13;
derivation of annual budgets. This committee will be made up of representatives from the HACCA,&#13;
NACP, GCMU, and MOPH and shall report to the HACCA. The Planning Committee shall also&#13;
coordinate quarterly budget reviews to ensure adequate budget discipline and control. The committee&#13;
will be responsible for ensuring that project expenditures for each fiscal year are captured in the&#13;
Governmental Development budget of that fiscal year. The MOPH must get approvals from the&#13;
presidential office and the parliament and attach them to B27 and PCS forms at the time of requesting&#13;
yearly allotments for contracts under the project to avoid delays in payment processing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   36&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
FundsFlow&#13;
The standard funds flow mechanism inAfghanistan will be followed inthis project. Project funds will&#13;
be deposited in the DA to be opened and maintained at the D a Afghanistan Bank (DaB). The DA, in&#13;
keeping with current practices for other projects in Afghanistan, will be operated by the SDU in the&#13;
Treasury Department o f MOF. Requests for payments from the DA will be made to the SDU by the&#13;
G C M U M O P Hwhen needed.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to payments out of DA funds, the GCMUMOPH can also request the SDU to make (a)&#13;
direct payments from the Grant Account to contractors, consultants or consulting firms; (b) transfer&#13;
sub-grant amounts to beneficiaries (awarded out o f the Innovation Initiative component); and (c)&#13;
request issuance o f special commitments for contracts covered by letters o f credit. These payments&#13;
will follow World Bank procedures. All project payments will be made to either international firms,&#13;
local firms or individuals or sub-grant recipients that have bank accounts in DaB, a local commercial&#13;
bank, or an overseas bank. All payments will be made either through bank transfers into the account&#13;
o f such firms or by check. Expenditures for each component will be paid centrally from MOPH in&#13;
accordance with the approvalmechanisms documented inthe HIV/AIDS project FMManual.&#13;
&#13;
Payments to line ministries, community NGOs and the private sector from the Innovation window&#13;
will be based on the approved performance agreement, Le., memorandum o f understanding (MOU)&#13;
for line ministries and contracts for NGOs and private firms. The request for payments should be&#13;
authorized by the line ministry's designated representative to enable NACP and G C M U to commence&#13;
processing the payments. Release o f first tranche payments, where necessary will be based on the&#13;
terms o f the performance agreement. Subsequent release o f funds will be dependent on the&#13;
achievement o f performance milestones stated in the agreement, submission o f SOEs to&#13;
G C M U M O P H by sub-grant recipients and relevant supporting documents (if required), and&#13;
submission of financial and physical progress reports to G C M U M O P H as o f that date. Where it i s&#13;
observed by NACP and G C M U that a recipient has utilized the funds to finance activities other than&#13;
those stated inthe approved work plans, these would be considered as ineligible expenditures and the&#13;
amounts would need to be refundedto the project.&#13;
&#13;
Cash advances may be taken from the Designated Account, and held and managed by MOPH. This&#13;
agency's controls, holding, accounting, and preparation o f SOEs have been satisfactorily assessed.&#13;
New cash advances will only be made when all other prior cash advances have beenjustified through&#13;
submission o f SOEs to the SDU.&#13;
&#13;
Retroactive financing o f up to SDR 657,000 (US$l.O million equivalent) is envisaged for&#13;
expenditures between March 1, 2007 and when the grant i s signed. Retroactive financing can be&#13;
disbursed only after the grant becomes effective.&#13;

&#13;
Provisiono f preventive and diagnostic services underthe HIV/AIDS project i s expected to&#13;
benefit the hygiene and sanitation situation inthe country however it could generate&#13;
infectious bio-medical wastes such as sharps (infected needles and syringes, etc), infected&#13;
blood, HIV test kits usedinVCT centers, blood banks and laboratories and pharmaceutical&#13;
wastes. These wastes, ifnot managed and disposed properly, can have direct environmental&#13;
and public health implications.&#13;
&#13;
The proposed project has been classified as category "B" as per the World Bank's&#13;
Operational Policy on Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01) for environmental screening&#13;
purposes given the risks associated with the handling and disposal o f medical waste and&#13;
general health waste. Category B projects imply that the potential adverse environmental&#13;
impacts o f the program are site-specific and inmost cases mitigatory measures can be&#13;
designed readily and appropriately.&#13;
&#13;
The MoPH and the NACP team are feeling that under this project we are focusing on the&#13;
Infection Control and Waste Management issues only inthe activities pertaining to this&#13;
current HIV/AIDS project but it could be a good start and foundation stone for a more&#13;
comprehensive Waste Management Framework with other programs and institutions inthe&#13;
country inthe future.&#13;
&#13;
An Infection Control and Waste Management (IC-WM) Planhas been developed by NACP&#13;
which focuses on the establishment o f a sound management system for the treatment and&#13;
disposal o f the waste related to the testing, treatment and prevention o f HIVIAIDS STI and&#13;
includes generic guidance and protocols and alternative technologies for treatment,&#13;
transportation and disposal inaccordance with the size o f healthcare facilities.&#13;
&#13;
Safeguard Policies&#13;
&#13;
This project has triggered OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment due to the potential adverse&#13;
environmental impacts o f healthcare waste as discussed inthe previous section. A Limited&#13;
environmental assessment was undertaken, by different stakeholders, by visiting some&#13;
government runand some NGOs runfacilities, which included field visits and&#13;
consultations. NACP does not have the necessary institutional capacity to implementthe&#13;
IC-WM Plan and would needto obtain appropriate support for components such as&#13;
training, IEC and monitoring. An external independentevaluation i s recommended before&#13;
the mid term review ofthe program to ensure all activities are on track.&#13;
&#13;
The final version, ofthe Infection Control and Waste Management Plan should be&#13;
disclosed inthe World Bank InfoShop prior to Appraisal and also it i s the responsibility o f&#13;
the NACP and the MoPH to make it available to all relevant national stakeholders inthe&#13;
local languages as well as inthe relevant websites.&#13;

 Provision o f preventative and treatment services under the NACP i s expected to generate&#13;
 infectious bio-medical wastes such as sharps (infected needles and syringes, equipment,IV&#13;
 sets) infected blood, HIV test kits used in VCT centers, blood banks and laboratories and&#13;
 pharmaceutical wastes. These wastes, if not managed and disposed properly, can have&#13;
 direct environmental and public health implications. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at&#13;
 great risk as most bloodborne occupational infections occur through injuries from sharps&#13;
 contaminated with blood through accidents or unsafe practices. Systematic management o f&#13;
 such clinical waste from source to disposal i s therefore integral to prevention o f infection&#13;
 and control o fthe epidemic.&#13;
&#13;
 In this context, governments have an obligation to implement the provisions of the 2001&#13;
 UnitedNations Declaration o f Commitment on HIVIAIDS, which include a commitment to&#13;
 strengthen health-care systems and expand treatment, as well as to respond to HIVIAIDS in&#13;
 the world of work by increasing prevention and care programs in public, private and&#13;
 informal work-places.&#13;

HIV/AIDS ControlProgram in Afghanistan&#13;
&#13;
The first HIV positive case was identifiedincentral blood bank in 1989. As the country&#13;
was inconflict inthat time the Government o f Afghanistan responded to it by launching&#13;
awarenessprograms. In2003 the Government o f Afghanistan formed National AIDS&#13;
Control Program (NACP) inMoPH. The first National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan was&#13;
developed which was revised in2006. Now the six functional VCCT centers are&#13;
functioning throughout the country.&#13;
&#13;
Afghanistan National Development Strategy has a statement regarding HIV/AIDS which&#13;
indicate a high political commitment on government side.&#13;
&#13;
Environment and Public Health Impactsof the Program&#13;
&#13;
Provision o f preventative and treatment services under the HIV AIDS project i s expected to&#13;
generate infectious bio-medical wastes such as sharps (infected needles and syringes,&#13;
surgical equipment, IV sets) infected blood, HIV test kits usedin VCT centers, blood banks&#13;
and laboratories and pharmaceutical wastes. These wastes, if not managed and disposed&#13;
properly, can have direct environmental and public health implications. Healthcare workers&#13;
(HCW) are at great risk as most blood-borne occupational infections occur through injuries&#13;

The NACP projects specially world bank supported project for the first time, has been&#13;
classified as Category "B" as per the World Bank's Operational Policy on Environmental&#13;
Assessment (OP 4.0 1). Category B projects imply that the potential adverse environmental&#13;
impacts o f the program are site-specific and in most cases mitigatory measures can be&#13;
designed readily and appropriately. NACP i s developing an Infection Control and Waste&#13;
Management Plan which defines a structured a systematic approach to institute best&#13;
practices in managing health and environmental risks effectively.&#13;
&#13;
Also the ministry has developed guidelines on Auto-Disable Syringes Use and Disposal.&#13;
Auto-Disable (AD) syringes have beenintroduced inthe country as part o f the Universal&#13;
ImmunizationProgram. Accordingly, the MoPHhas laid down the National Guidelineson&#13;
use and disposal o f AD syringes.&#13;

&#13;
National AIDS Control Program was established in 2003 as a unit in MoPH to lead the&#13;
country response to the epidemic o f HIV/AIDS. NACP has the responsibility o f steering,&#13;
supporting, coordinating and overseeing the activities carried out for HIV/AIDS control&#13;
program. HIV/AIDS Co-ordination Committee o f Afghanistan (HACCA) i s the entity&#13;
which oversees NACP.&#13;
&#13;
NGOs form an important element o f targeted intervention. NGOs undertake HIV&#13;
prevention activities through the public health system as well as through targeted&#13;
interventions. Thus while the bulk o f VCTCs, STD clinics are inthe public sector, targeted&#13;
interventions are implementedthrough NGOs who work with the high risk groups. For the&#13;
most, these NGOs also make testing services available through the same public networks.&#13;

The findings from the site visits and primary data collection have beengrouped intwo&#13;
categories:&#13;
&#13;
       (a) Government-runFacilities ("Government Facilities") that include primary,&#13;
            secondary and tertiary healthcare facilities; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
         (b) NGO-runFacilities ("NGO Facilities") that include VCTC and STD clinics.&#13;
Government-runFacilities&#13;
&#13;
Overview&#13;
&#13;
Most o f the government-run facilities surveyed had poor standards o f hygiene and&#13;
inadequate IC-WMpractices. Although awareness o f the Bio-medical Rules and Hospital&#13;
Waste Management Guidelines i s high (over 90% o f the facilities visited), lack o f funds,&#13;
irregular supply o f barrier protection and PEP(Post Exposure Prophylaxis) and human&#13;
resource shortage were cited as the main reasons for poor implementation o f IC-WM&#13;
practices. Though more than 90% o f the facilities visited were aware o f the Applicable&#13;
statute and guidelines, specific compliance requirements were not known to the majority o f&#13;
the HCWsinterviewed.&#13;
&#13;
Inmost ofthe facilities surveyed, hospital infectioncontrol committees had not been&#13;
constituted. Even inthose facilities inwhich IC-WM committees were present, the&#13;
authorities admittedthat these were not very active.&#13;
&#13;
Few or none IEC material were observed inmost of the facilities visited. Additionally,&#13;
there i s no evaluationprocess to assess the quality of training imparted and its outcome in&#13;
terms o f improved IC-WMpractices.&#13;
&#13;
Employment of InfectionControlMeasures&#13;
&#13;
The general assessment was that a large number o f nurses, paramedics were found to be&#13;
ignorant o f good practices. Since these H C W also will work with HIV/AIDS patients, the&#13;
lack o f availability o f barrier protection, disposable needles and PPE becomes a critical&#13;
issue. In several instances the staff admitted to not using gloves during blood handling&#13;
procedures. They also admitted to using the same disposable syringe for several patients&#13;
and thus needle recapping was a common practice. AD syringes could not be observed at&#13;
any of the facilities visited. On the contrary glass syringes were being used at several&#13;
places for which the general practice i s reuse after sterilization.&#13;
&#13;
Needle Cutters were rarely available and were mostly electric ones which are prone to&#13;
beingunderutilized during power cuts or being damaged due to voltage fluctuations. It was&#13;
observed that HCW either did not utilize the needle-cutters or instead broke the needles&#13;
with their bare hands, or by using a heavy object, or even not at all. In majority o f the&#13;
instances the intact syringes or mutilated needles were not immersed in 1% hypochlorite&#13;
solution as required.&#13;
&#13;
H C W in several o f the secondary and tertiary facilities did report accidents due to needle&#13;
stick injuries. However, the incidence o f reporting was low, with only 30-40 percent o f the&#13;
total injuries being reported.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In PHCs, no waste segregation and disinfection practices could be observed. The general&#13;
standards o f sanitation and hygiene were found to be very low. Infectious waste (blood-&#13;
soaked cotton, used un-mutilated syringes, worn gloves) was seen scattered under the&#13;
patients' beds, in the corridors and washrooms. All infectious and non- infectious waste&#13;
was observed to be collectively disposed in shallow open pits.&#13;
&#13;
Insecondary and tertiary facilities partial waste categorization and segregation practices&#13;
were observed though awareness o f statutory (Regulatory) requirements was largely absent.&#13;
Even if known, non-availability o f appropriately colored poly-bags and bins, leads to&#13;
improper segregation with waste being generally handledwithout any barrier protection.&#13;
&#13;
NGO-run Facilities&#13;
&#13;
Overview&#13;
&#13;
In general, all NGO run-facilities demonstrated awareness of and adherence to good IC-&#13;
WM practices, partial or complete. These facilities typically had regular training, sufficient&#13;
funds, regular supply o f barrier protection and PEP and human resources. Awareness o f&#13;
NACP publications was also high as these form the basis o f training and functioning o f&#13;
these facilities. Since the funding o f NGO facilities i s separate from that o f Government&#13;
facilities, hence selective training and equipmentavailability could be observed.&#13;
&#13;
Employment of InfectionControlMeasures&#13;
&#13;
Due to systematic training and re-training, the awareness is significantly higher in these&#13;
HCW. NGO have been providing barrier protection, PEP, disposable needles and needle&#13;
cutters (electrical type) on a regular basis. Accident Reporting i s also observed to a large&#13;
extent and most workers had been vaccinated against HBV.&#13;
&#13;
Employment of Waste Management Measures&#13;
&#13;
The fact that the waste disposal for NGO facilities i s dependent on the host facility's&#13;
disposal practices further compounds the problem o f waste management. In instances&#13;
where waste management i s being carried out by third parties (such as at Common&#13;
Treatment Facilities) there is a higher degree o f conformance to Biomedical Rules.&#13;
&#13;
RECORD OF CONSULTATIONLDISCUSSION WITH RELEVANT&#13;
STAKEHOLDERS&#13;
&#13;
Two types o f consultations were held during the course o f this study:&#13;
&#13;
         (a) Consultation with individual stakeholders during the site visits; and&#13;
&#13;
         (b) Consultation convened by the NACP design team and facilitated by&#13;
             environmental department o f MoPH.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The IC-WM Plan proposed below is based on existing documentation, observations during&#13;
site visits, review o f existing practices amongst other health initiatives and discussions and&#13;
consultations with stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
INFECTION CONTROL AND WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN&#13;
&#13;
The IC-WM Plan("Plan") provides a consolidated, reference material on IC-WM good&#13;
practices that may be further tailored to suit the facility's needs. The Plan i s build on the&#13;
following framework:&#13;
&#13;
        (a) Section I : Infection Control and Waste Management;&#13;
             ,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        (b) Section 11: Capacity Building;&#13;
&#13;
        (c) Section 111: Institutional Framework;&#13;
&#13;
        (d) Section IV:Monitoring and Evaluation; and&#13;
&#13;
        (e) Section V: Implementation Schedule.&#13;
&#13;
Section I: InfectionControland Waste Management&#13;
&#13;
Healthcare workers involved in the NACP face the highest occupational risk due to the&#13;
nature o f their work dealing with testing and treatment o f HIV/AIDS cases. Infectious&#13;
waste from AIDS related activities include primarily: needles and sharps, blood and blood&#13;
bags, used test kits, culture samples and slides and other related infectious waste such as&#13;
swabs, gloves, bandages, sputumcups etc. Thus it i s imperative that good IC-WM practices&#13;
are implemented. This activity should not be restricted only to certain sections of the&#13;
healthcare facility likeVCTC, PPTCT, but extend to all facilities runnedby NACP.&#13;
&#13;
1.      Waste Segregation and On-siteStorage&#13;
&#13;
Segregation at source i s the most critical step towards a well- functioning waste&#13;
management system. Separation o f infectious and non- infectious waste becomes&#13;
impossible once mixed, resulting in greater risk to all concerned.&#13;
&#13;
The Bio-medical Rulesprovides color coding for waste segregation and their respective&#13;
treatment options, as listed below inTable 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
The facility should ensure that there are designated segregation points, as close to the&#13;
generation points as possible. Segregation requires appropriate consumables, such as good&#13;
quality and adequately sized containers, non-chlorinatedplastic bags, needle cutters and&#13;
safety boxes. The specifications and color-coding provided inthe Biomedical Rules need to&#13;
be strictly followed.&#13;
&#13;
2.      Collectionand Transportationof Bio-medicalWastes&#13;
&#13;
Transportation o f bio- medical wastes, within and outside the healthcare facility needs to be&#13;
secure and well-managed. Spills and leakages can be risky for patients and the community,&#13;
but can also result inpilferage and reuse o f potentially infectious items such as syringes&#13;
etc.&#13;
&#13;
Specific steps to be taken by each facility include:&#13;
&#13;
        (a) Waste should be collected from various sources and transported to a central&#13;
             location;&#13;
&#13;
        (b) Within the facility, special waste routes should be designated to avoid patient&#13;
             care areas. Special timing should be identified for transportation o f bio-medical&#13;
             waste to the central point;&#13;
&#13;
        (c) Dedicatedwheeled containers, trolleys or carts should be usedto transport the&#13;
             waste to the collectiodtreatment site. These should be such that the waste can&#13;
             be easily loaded and emptied and remain secured during transportation. They&#13;
             should not have any sharp edges and be easy to clean and disinfect;&#13;
&#13;
        (d) Ifdisposal is done within the premises o fthe healthcare facility, care should be&#13;
             taken that different categories o f waste are disposed of accurately (sharps in&#13;
             sharps pit, anatomical waste in deep burial pits etc) as designated inthe&#13;
             Biomedical Rules; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        (e) Waste handlers should be properly trained and should use barrier protection&#13;
             duringtransportation.&#13;
&#13;
3.      Treatment and Disposalof Bio-medicalWastes&#13;
&#13;
        (a) Used sharps (needles, slides, scalpels etc), blood bags, syringes and other&#13;
             infectious plastic and liquid wastes (Categories 4, 7, 8, and 10 of the&#13;
            Biomedical Rules) need to be disinfected by immersion in 1% hypochlorite&#13;
             solution or any other equivalent chemical reagent. It must be ensured that&#13;
             chemical treatment ensures disinfection;&#13;
&#13;
        (b) Waste containers should contain freshly prepared disinfectant solution and be&#13;
             kept closed all the time. At all times, the waste container should not be more&#13;
            than 3/4th full;&#13;
&#13;
        (c) The waste containers should be emptiedat least once everyday;&#13;
&#13;
        (d) Infected linen in the hospital should be carefully packed in plastic bags, and&#13;
             disinfected before being sent for washing. Personnel involved in laundering&#13;
             infected linen should take adequate precautions to prevent the exposure to&#13;
             infections;&#13;
&#13;
        (e) A log o f quantity o f waste generated by type, name o f waste handler, time o f&#13;
             emptying waste container, time o f cleaning container and pouring disinfectant&#13;
             should be maintained; and&#13;
&#13;
        (0 Disposalas recommended inthe Rules,should be as follows:&#13;
&#13;
              (i)   Sharps intheir puncture proof containers should be drained of the&#13;
                    disinfectant and disposed inthe sharps pit, constructed within the&#13;
                    premises;&#13;
&#13;
              (ii)Infectedorganicwaste       should be disposed o f inthe deep burial pits&#13;
                    also constructed withinthe facility and covered with a layer o f lime and&#13;
                    soil; and&#13;
&#13;
              (iii)Infectedrecyclablessuchasplasticsandmetals,canbesentfor&#13;
                   .&#13;
                    recycling but only after disinfection and/or autoclaving.&#13;
&#13;
All equipment used for bio-medical waste treatment should be periodically subjected to&#13;
maintenance checks to ensure its functioning. Both preventive and corrective maintenance&#13;
schedules and records should be retained in the facility. As a general practice o f&#13;
maintaining good hygiene, the floors o f the facility should be first swabbed with a wet&#13;
cloth, then swept to remove grits to avoid dust carrying pathogens from rising into the air&#13;
and, finally, swabbed with a disinfectant solution. The swab cloth should be washed with&#13;
detergent after every use. The housekeeping personnel should employ use o f protective&#13;
barriers to prevent exposure to infection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4.      Sharps Management&#13;
&#13;
Given the high risk of infection from infected sharps, a separate section on the safe use and&#13;
disposal o f sharps i s being detailed. Sharps are anything that may cause puncture and cuts.&#13;
Sharps include needles, scalpels, blades, broken glass, slides, lancets, sutures, and IV&#13;
catheters. Infectedneedles, sharps and blood, if improperlyhandled, can be a source of&#13;
infection for the HCWs.&#13;
&#13;
Although the risk o f infection from contaminated sharps i s high for all categories o f HCW,&#13;
those most at risk o f exposures are nurses, medical staff and clinical laboratory staff (blood&#13;
collectors). Physicians are at some risk, but surgical and dental staff, although at high risk&#13;
o f injury, have a lower risk o f infection. It must be remembered that all health care&#13;
personnel (including cleaners, laundry staff and waste contractors) may be exposed to&#13;
inappropriately discarded sharps. While emergency rooms and operating theatres pose high&#13;
risk for HCW, it has been found that a) the majority o f exposures have occurred in general&#13;
ward areas and b) a larger number o f exposures which would be classified as high risk have&#13;
occurred in medical wards.&#13;
&#13;
The following measures must be taken to ensure sharps safety inthe work-place:&#13;
&#13;
              Barrier protection must always be usedwhen handling sharps;&#13;
&#13;
              Sharps must be segregated and stored inpuncture-proofcontainers at the point&#13;
              o f generation;&#13;
&#13;
              Sharps must be mutilated before treatment and disposal. Useddisposable or&#13;
              Autodisable (AD) syringes should be mutilated by usingneedle cutters/&#13;
              destroyers and hub-pullersand dropped into a puncture-proof container.&#13;
              Clipping, bending or breaking o f needles by hand or re-capping should be&#13;
              avoided as this may cause accidental injuries;&#13;
&#13;
             ,Usedsharps should not be left untreated or carelessly on counter tops, food&#13;
              trays, or beds, as this can pose a risk to all concerned;&#13;
&#13;
              Mutilated sharps should be immersedin 1 percent hypochlorite solution or any&#13;
              other equivalent chemical reagent for disinfection. Treatment by autoclaving /&#13;
              microwaving is also approved; and&#13;
&#13;
              Final disposal should be ina secured landfill. Wherever this i s not available&#13;
              everywhere,sharps pits or encapsulation should be used.&#13;
&#13;
A sharps pit is a circular or rectangular pit, where sharp wastes are disposed. These pits are&#13;
lined with brick, masonry or concrete rings. The pit shouldbe covered with a concrete&#13;
slab. When the pit is full, it should be sealed completely and another pit i s prepared.&#13;
&#13;
Encapsulation i s another method. When a container (puncture and leak proof containers) is&#13;
three-quarter full, material such as cement mortar, bituminous sand, plastic foam or clay i s&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
poured untilthe container i s completely filled. After the mediumhas dried, the containers&#13;
are sealed and disposed inlandfill sites.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
No.        Steps/ Stages&#13;
&#13;
1          Severe needles from disposable syringe immediately after administering injection&#13;
           usinga needle cuttedhub-cutter that removes the needle from disposable syringesor&#13;
           cuts plastic hub o f syringe from AD syringes.&#13;
&#13;
2          The cut needles get collected inthe puncture proofcontainer of the needlecutteri hub-&#13;
           cutter. The container should contain an appropriate disinfectant and the cut needles&#13;
           should be completely immersed inthe disinfectant&#13;
&#13;
3          Segregate and store syringes and unbroken (but discarded) vials in a red bag or&#13;
           container.&#13;
&#13;
4          Send the collected materials to the common bio-medical waste treatment facilities. If&#13;
           such facilities do not exist, then go to the next step.&#13;
&#13;
5          Treat the collected material in an autoclave. Ifthis is unavailable, treat the waste iii&#13;
           1% hypochlorite solution or boil inwater for at least 10 minutes. It shall be ensured&#13;
           that these treatments ensure disinfection.&#13;
&#13;
6         Dispose the autoclaved waste as follows: (i)Dispose the needles and broken vials in a&#13;
           pit / tank, (ii)Send the syringesand unbroken vials for recycling or landfill.&#13;
&#13;
7          Wash the containers properly for reuse.&#13;
&#13;
8         Make a proper record o f generation, treatment and disposal o f waste.&#13;
&#13;
         I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.      Blood safety in Laboratory&#13;
Blood i s the single most important source o f HIV, HBV, HCV and other blood borne&#13;
infections for HCWs. It i s mandatory to screen blood units for five transmissible infections:&#13;
Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV, syphilis and malaria. The Rules in the country also require&#13;
for testing procedures, quality control, standard qualifications, and experience for blood&#13;
bank personnel, maintenance o f complete and accurate records, strict guidelines for holding&#13;
of blood donation camps etc. and to be further improved.&#13;
&#13;
Careful donor screening, discouraging use o f paid donors, stringent screening o f donated&#13;
units of blood to prevent HIV transmission through blood and blood products. Another&#13;
important action taken by MoPHhas beento modernize the blood banks inthe country.&#13;
&#13;
Risk of infection varies with a number of factors, including type and number of exposures,&#13;
amount of blood involved in the exposure, amount o f virus in the patients' blood etc.&#13;
Modes o f exposure to blood borne pathogens ina laboratory have beendefinedas below:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 As per the Bio-medical Rules, infected blood and blood samples is characterized as liquid&#13;
 waste and should be disinfected with hypochlorite solution.&#13;
&#13;
. Screened positive blood bags, contaminated test kits and items are categorized as infected&#13;
 solid waste and should be disinfected by chemical treatment / autoclave and mutilated&#13;
 before disposal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Transport o f specimens should be done ina diligent manner. The sample should be kept&#13;
first inprimary container with enough absorbent material around it. The primary container&#13;
should then be placed in secondary container.&#13;
&#13;
Staff should take care that the secondary container i s also leak-proof, properly sealed and&#13;
labeled. Uprightposition must be maintainedat all times.&#13;
&#13;
6.      InfectionControl&#13;
&#13;
The four key areas o f infection control for the NACP are:&#13;
&#13;
        (a)   Immunizationagainst nosocomial infections;&#13;
&#13;
        (b)   Availability and use o f barrier protection;&#13;
&#13;
        (c)   Management o f PEP; and&#13;
&#13;
        (d)   Awareness.&#13;

Section 11: Capacity Building and Awareness&#13;
&#13;
Training and sensitization o f various HCWs and functionaries within and outside the health&#13;
care system i s vital for the successful implementation o f any IC-WM Plan. The training&#13;
should focus on Universal Precautions, principles of waste management, identification o f&#13;
roles and responsibilities for implementation, monitoring and reporting.&#13;
&#13;
All awareness, training and communication initiatives should be oriented towards&#13;
providing knowledge / information, building skills and competencies and bringing about a&#13;
fundamental, mindset change in the attitudes o f staff and personnel. The Training Plan and&#13;
budget should be included into the MoPH PIP and into NACP PIP and program budget.&#13;
&#13;
The following steps should be followed for implementing training:&#13;
&#13;
             Conduct baseline assessment o f training needs for HCWs involved inthe&#13;
             implementation o f AIDS Control Program. For an integrated approach;&#13;
&#13;
             A Training Planneeds to be developed basedupon existing capacity and&#13;
             training needs. At the outset, this plan should distinguishbetween trainers and&#13;
             non-trainers and elaborate the criteria for identifying trainers and their&#13;
             requirementfor training;&#13;
&#13;
             Training should be provided to all HCWs, including doctors, nurses, ward&#13;
             boys, paramedics, laboratory technicians, and Class IV and/or housekeeping&#13;
             staff; and&#13;
&#13;
             Training should be imparted through:&#13;
&#13;
             (i)Disseminationof Information,EducationandCommunication&#13;
                 (1EC)material that will sensitize HCWs and create general awareness on&#13;
                 importance o f IC-WM; and&#13;
&#13;
            (ii)TechnicaltrainingforHCWswithspecificresponsibilitiesfordiscrete&#13;
                 activities related to IC-WM.&#13;
&#13;
            Training inInfection Control and inWaste Management should be a&#13;
            comprehensive package as the two are closely inter-twined;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
              The Train the Trainer program will have to be undertaken at two levels - state&#13;
              and district levels. Training should be provided on an annual basis, with&#13;
              refresher courses annually or biannually;&#13;
&#13;
               Inadditionto classroom typetraining, IEC material and awareness-creating&#13;
               activities also needto be employed for training the HCW. Training should&#13;
              preferably be provided on site;&#13;
&#13;
               Eachfacility should keep records o f training provided to employees, by&#13;
               category o f employee; and&#13;
&#13;
               The IEC material must be prepared inthe local language on both IC and W M&#13;
               and should beprominently displayed at various places. It should serve as a&#13;
               reminder for all the trained employees as well as sensitize patients visiting the&#13;
               facility.&#13;
&#13;
Section 111: Reporting,Monitoringand Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring &amp; evaluation will be done through a mix o f internal and external approaches.&#13;
The internal reporting and evaluation mechanism on the IC-WM implementation should be&#13;
integrated with overall NACP reporting. Management Information Systems (MIS)&#13;
indicators pertaining to the IC-WM will be developed during implementation. External&#13;
monitoring inthe form o f IC-WM implementation audits is also beingrecommended.&#13;
&#13;
1.      Quarterly monitoring&#13;
&#13;
Each facility must establish a robust system o f monitoring through regular documentation&#13;
and assessments. Ideally, each facility should designate one senior employee responsible&#13;
for documentation and another for internal evaluation. Inthe case o f VCTC, PPTCT and&#13;
blood banks, the laboratory technician should maintain records o f waste sharps, gloves, etc.&#13;
and infectious waste. The records must be maintained on a daily basis and internal&#13;
assessments should be conducted on a monthly basis. The monthly report from NGO&#13;
should directly be send to NACP.&#13;
&#13;
2.      PeriodicImplementationReview&#13;
&#13;
Periodic implementationreview o f the IC-WM should be undertaken, and as far as&#13;
possible, this review should be inbuilt into the regular review process o f the NACP.&#13;
&#13;
This review should focus on consolidated information and reporting from individual&#13;
facility level. To facilitate regular and sustained monitoring, each NGO implementing&#13;
HIVIAIDSprogram develops annual Action Plans specifically for IC-WM, which should&#13;
be includedinto the MoPHPIPS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                16&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3.      PerformanceIndicators&#13;
&#13;
NACP envisages a robust nationwide Strategic InformationManagement System (SIMS)&#13;
with focus on implementation, monitoring, evaluation and strategic surveillance,&#13;
appropriate standards for measuring performance, analyzing variances, identifying&#13;
bottlenecks, alerting program managers and facilitating corrective measures. Some generic&#13;
Performance Indicators o f the IC-WMPlan have beenrecommendedbelow, which should&#13;
be integrated into the NACP SMIS.&#13;
&#13;
        (a)   Implementationo f all components o f the IC-WMPlan;&#13;
&#13;
        (b)   Timely procurement and distribution o f IC-WM consumables and equipment;&#13;
&#13;
        (c)   Regular and timely training programs undertaken;&#13;
&#13;
        (d)   Regular evaluation o f training effectiveness and assessment o f employee&#13;
              behavioral practices;&#13;
&#13;
        (e)   Timely interventions and coordinationwith host facility on significant issues&#13;
             which could hinder effective implementation o f IC-WMPlan; and&#13;
&#13;
        (f)  Timely and regular reporting and evaluation undertaken, with corrective&#13;
             measures when necessary.&#13;
&#13;
4.      ExternalImplementationAudits&#13;
&#13;
The NACP will be responsible for hiringo f an external technical consultant/firm to&#13;
undertake an independent evaluation o f the program and its implementation. The agency to&#13;
conduct this technical review should be chosen on the basis o f their technical expertise and&#13;
established experience in Bio-medical waste management and environmental auditing.&#13;
Such an independent audit review will be undertaken once duringthe life o f the program,&#13;
preferably before a mid-term evaluation is conducted.&#13;
&#13;

            Afghanistan - HIV/AIDS Prevention Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The HIV/AIDS Prevention Project will
            contribute to Afghanistan's national development goals
            of maintaining HIV prevalence below 0.5 percent in the
            general population and below 5 percent among vulnerable
            groups at high risk of infection. The project's
            development objectives are to slow down the spread of HIV
            and build up the national capacity to respond to the
            epidemic. This will be accomplished by: (a) behavior change
            among vulnerable groups at high risk; and (b) improving
            knowledge of HIV prevention and reducing stigma related to
            HIV and AIDS in the general population. The project has four
            components: communications and advocacy activities will aim
            to increase knowledge of HIV prevention among opinion
            leaders and the general population, and reduce stigma and
            discrimination against vulnerable groups at high risk of HIV
            and AIDS; strengthening HIV surveillance through biological
            and behavioral surveys and knowledge attitudes and practice
            studies; targeted interventions for people engaged in high
            risk behaviors, including injecting drug use and unsafe sex;
            and program management, capacity building, monitoring and
            evaluation, and an Innovation Initiative to promote multi
            sector activities in support of project objectives.
