&#13;
The following is a transcript of an oral interview conducted by the authors of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
fiftieth anniversary history: John P. Lewis, Richard Webb and Devesh Kapur, The World Bank: Its&#13;
First Half Century, Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press, 1997. It is not a formal oral&#13;
history, and it is not a systematic overview of the work of the person interviewed. At times the&#13;
authors discussed the planned publication itself and the sources that should be consulted; at other&#13;
times they talked about persons and publications extraneous to the Bank. Some interview tapes and&#13;
transcripts begin and end abruptly. Nevertheless, the World Bank Group Archives believes that&#13;
this transcript may be of interest to researchers and makes it available for public use.&#13;

[Begin Tape 1, Side A]1&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: . . there was a lot that I don't know, including who, what other people were being&#13;
considered, but I understand there were a number of candidates, because Tom [Alden W.] Clausen&#13;
was known from the time of the annual meeting preceding his departure not to be subject to&#13;
extension. He had had a fight with Don [Donald T.] Regan apparently of some sort and had&#13;
decided that he would announce his retirement at the annual meeting before, nine months before his&#13;
term ended. And so a lot of people came forward and wanted to be President of the World Bank.&#13;
And I was called in March, I guess, of that year by Jim [James A. III] Baker, who was then&#13;
Secretary of the Treasury. I had been out of Congress for two years--for a year and a half anyway.&#13;
I was teaching at the University of Rochester and I was on a number of corporate boards and&#13;
writing editorials for U.S. News and World Report and doing a lot of speaking on tax subjects and,&#13;
well, having a good time. There was a lot of foundation work, too.&#13;
&#13;
Jim said, "Barber, we've got a real problem. We've got a lot of candidates for the World Bank, and&#13;
a lot of them are totally inappropriate. And we're trying to weed them down, and it's hard to do&#13;
because they all have their adherents. And if you would let me use your name, I could get a&#13;
number of them out of the race."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Well, Jim, I don't know anything about the World Bank, and I'm not a candidate."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "That's all right. I just want your permission to use your name." Famous last words, huh!&#13;
And he said, "There are some of these people would know who you were and would realize they&#13;
didn't have much choice if you were a candidate." He said, "It will never become public. I will not&#13;
embarrass you by appearing to have had you under consideration" and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Well, fine. Go ahead." I didn't hear from him for a couple of weeks.&#13;
&#13;
I called up George Bush, who was an old friend of mine, Vice President then, and said, "George,&#13;
what in the world's going on? I haven't heard anything more about this, but they were using my&#13;
name in connection with the World Bank thing for reasons that seemed a little spurious."&#13;
&#13;
And he said, "God, I don't know whatâ&#128;&#153;s going on there, Barber, but I'll find out about it."&#13;
&#13;
Well, as a result Baker called me back and said, "I'll let you know within a week what's happening&#13;
here." He said, "We're having considerable difficulties of one sort of another in resolving it."&#13;

                                      Barber B. Conable&#13;
                              May 8 and August 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      3&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Don Regan and George Shultz and I have entered into an agreement that any one of the&#13;
three of us could veto a candidate, and so we're working together on this."&#13;
&#13;
A week later he finally called me back and said, "Barber, I'm sorry to tell you."&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Well, Jim, you know, don't apologize for a thing. I wasn't a candidate. It's perfectly&#13;
all right."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "God damn it, listen to me. I'm sorry to tell you you're the only guy we can agree on." He&#13;
said, "I told you the three of us had veto power, and everybody else is out. It is not going to be an&#13;
American unless you take it."&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Well, [Ronald W.] Reagan won't appoint me because I've been saying nasty things&#13;
about his tax bill."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "You didn't listen to me. It isn't going to be an American unless you take it. We're telling&#13;
the President that if you won't take it, itâ&#128;&#153;ll have to be offered to the Europeans."&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "My lord, Jim, this--you can't do this to me! I--this was not the understanding we had."&#13;
&#13;
And he said, "I know, I know. I'm sorry; this is the way it's worked out."&#13;
&#13;
And that's what happened. I--I met with my family and we earnestly discussed it, and I finally&#13;
decided very few people from Alexander, New York, get the chance to be useful on a global scale,&#13;
and Iâ&#128;&#153;d better be grateful for the opportunity. So I took it.&#13;
&#13;
Now, when I decided that Iâ&#128;&#153;d reached the stage in life where I should probably subside, I was&#13;
scared about what, who Nick [Nicholas F.] Brady might appoint. Nick has had very little interest&#13;
in this institution. And so I went directly to George, and I said, "George, I want to tell you the U.S.&#13;
has been bullying this institution to a degree that unless you appoint somebody who is recognized&#13;
as a man of international stature, the Europeans and the Japanese are very likely to try to take the&#13;
presidency away from you. Thereâ&#128;&#153;s no--there's nothing in the charter that says it's got to be an&#13;
American, and I can tell you there is a lot of dissatisfaction in U.S. leadership in the Bank. And&#13;
you better accept the responsibility yourself, because if Brady makes an appointment, it's likely to&#13;
be one of the people in Treasury."&#13;
&#13;
George said, "Don't worry. It won't be [David C.] Mulford. Let's talk about who you think it ought&#13;
to be."&#13;
&#13;
I mentioned Paul Volcker.&#13;
&#13;
He said, "What about Lew [Lewis T.] Preston?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Lew Preston is a recognized, a man of international stature. I think he would work out well.&#13;
I don't know Lew well, but I know him to be a man of judgment and a man who was sought out for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Barber B. Conable&#13;
                               May 8 and August 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      4&#13;
&#13;
his advice by others. He's certainly the leading banker in the United States. So,â&#128;&#157; I said, â&#128;&#156;I think he&#13;
would be fine."&#13;
&#13;
Next thing I knew, Iâ&#128;&#153;m telling you more--again, I'm telling you more about this than I really should,&#13;
probably--Brady called me and said, "Barber, George has asked Lew Preston to be President of the&#13;
World Bank. So I'm telling you this so that if he calls you, you can put in a good word for the job."&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Well, how do you feel about it, Nick?"&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Well, it's the boss's call." That's not what Joe [Henry H.] Fowler thought about Bob&#13;
[Robert S.] McNamara.&#13;
&#13;
But before I knew it, that night John Robinson came over and said, "Barber, now you didn't know&#13;
this, but I'm very interested in being President of the World Bank, and if Lew Preston turns Bush&#13;
down, will you put in a good word with Bush for me?" I said, "John, I'd be glad to, but I think the&#13;
President's going to make this decision himself." And of course Lew accepted.&#13;
&#13;
But it was a strange affair all the way around, except that I felt I did not want to rely on Nick&#13;
Brady--who knew nothing about the job or the institution, despite having been our governor all&#13;
these years--did not want to rely on him to make a somewhat casual appointment.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: How about your--the Board [of Executive Directors] in all of this? Do they get . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: The Board sent people to me. Both Part I and Part II people came to me and said,&#13;
"We can assure you if you want to extend, you can be extended, and that we would like you to stay&#13;
because we're scared of what we might get otherwise." Put it on a high level. And I was grateful&#13;
for that. And that meant that I--what I said to George in effect was, "Look, if you're going to&#13;
appoint some guy who ran for Congress on the Republican ticket from Boise, Idaho, and got&#13;
defeated to be President of the World Bank, I'm not leaving because I can be extended by my&#13;
Board, and I don't need your nomination." Now, George is an old friend. I can talk to him very&#13;
frankly. "I don't need your nomination. I'm emotionally involved with the institution. I don't want&#13;
to stay, but I will stay if--unless you appoint somebody who is of international stature, who can&#13;
ensure that the institution will have strong support in this country and who can understand the&#13;
initiatives I've undertaken over there and extend them." I--so I talked fairly tough to George, too.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: What about this as a process? Is it . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: It's a very strange process because by tradition it's an American nomination. The&#13;
Board, however, does the choosing.&#13;
&#13;
When Jim Baker asked me, I remember saying to him, "Jim, I'd never get through the Senate&#13;
because I'm pro-choice on abortion."&#13;
&#13;
Jim said, "You don't have to go through the Senate. It's all handled in your Board." And he said,&#13;
"We can sell you, and we will, to our major partners."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Barber B. Conable&#13;
                              May 8 and August 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                        5&#13;
&#13;
But I must acknowledge there was a lot of misgiving on that Board about me when I came on.&#13;
They had not had a politician there before, and they were well aware that the average American&#13;
congressman doesn't know a hell of a lot about the World Bank, as I didn't. I had supported the&#13;
World Bank. It was one of those institutions I had vaguely thought worthy of support but didn't&#13;
know a great deal about the details of its corporate existence. And I went back and looked up my&#13;
record on the World Bank--I wasn't even sure of that. I found that I had been quite supportive over&#13;
the years and was pleased about that. That was another thing I looked up before this.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I suppose the president that the Board resisted the most at the beginning was probably&#13;
McNamara.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: I don't know whether that's so or not, but McNamara had a very difficult time the&#13;
first couple of years because of his identification with the Vietnamese War. We hear a lot of myths&#13;
around here about McNamara's having other people get out of the airplane first and so forth, about&#13;
the tremendous protest that attended his presence at the Copenhagen meeting of the World Bank in&#13;
1970 and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
Bob saw this as an opportunity for atonement. He threw himself into it with a vigor that made him&#13;
the prototype president of the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Most people think I succeeded him. I introduce myself, and they say, "What do you do?"&#13;
&#13;
I say, "I'm President of the World Bank,"&#13;
&#13;
"You're not Bob McNamara." You know, that's the reaction. He was here for thirteen years, and&#13;
his identification with the institution was total.&#13;
&#13;
I guess Bob had a tough time at the beginning and at the end of his term. In the middle he was&#13;
considered to be an elemental force. At the end the elemental force had begun to grate on the staff&#13;
here to some extent. He was a very--of course, he was very much a loner always in the institution,&#13;
made his own decisions and tried to control details, which in an institution like this is not easy to&#13;
do. This is a big cross-cultural bureaucracy of some dimension.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: After you gave in, decided to accept . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: I came down here then May first and was here a month before I took over the job&#13;
because I knew I didn't know anything about it and I wanted to be well indoctrinated. It was,&#13;
however, not handled very well, I'd have to say. I was put in an office over in the International&#13;
Square Building, three or four blocks from here, and people traipsed over and met with me and then&#13;
traipsed back. I got no sense of the institution until the day I became president. I got to know some&#13;
of the personalities involved on a one-on-one basis, but the--now, for instance, Iâ&#128;&#153;ve got--next week&#13;
Lew Preston will be here for three days, and I'll take him to a senior management meeting, I'll take&#13;
him to a board meeting, he'll haveâ&#128;&#148;Iâ&#128;&#153;ve given him in an office in the back of the suite here. I want&#13;
to be sure he has a greater sense of this institution as an institution than I had when I came here, and&#13;
we'll do everything we can to see that he understands the nature of the job. I think Lew probably&#13;
thinks he's going to do a lot of financing here. I spent 2 percent of my time on financing. My time&#13;
&#13;
                                       Barber B. Conable&#13;
                               May 8 and August 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                        6&#13;
&#13;
was 98 percent spent on development and political issues of one sort or another. Although it's a&#13;
non-political institution, it does have the time and the politics of 155 countries.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Right, right. You know, we have a second volume we're going to produce, which we're&#13;
going to edit. It's going to be written by ten invited authors, and they all are going to be looking at&#13;
the Bank from some outside perspective, a borrowing country or whatnot. One of them is going to&#13;
be looking at the Bank as a non-political institution in a political world.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Now that's, thatâ&#128;&#153;s a--it's a tough business because although our standards are non-&#13;
political and great efforts are made to keep economic standards as the sole criterion of our activity&#13;
here, nevertheless our Board is made up of people who have direct political accountability to their&#13;
governments.&#13;
&#13;
And on an issue like China after Tiananmen Square weâ&#128;&#153;ve had a very difficult time. There are a&#13;
billion, a hundred million people living on less than a dollar a day, fit subjects of development&#13;
activity, and a government which, despite its authoritarianism, is willing to do economic&#13;
experimentation. And there's a lot to be learned from working in China quite apart from the&#13;
contributions we can make to the quality of life there, quite apart from the significance of economic&#13;
pluralism as a precursor to political pluralism. So--but there I've had to deal with a G-7 that has 52&#13;
percent of the vote in our Board and had an absolutely united front on â&#128;&#156;nothing but basic needs,â&#128;&#157;&#13;
which is not part of our charter. There is no such criterion in our charter. We couldn'tâ&#128;&#148;we&#13;
couldnâ&#128;&#153;t operate on that basis. It wasâ&#128;&#148;I mean, it would have been illegal to use that as a criterion&#13;
for the lending we've put together. Now, we've tried to constrain our lending now to economic&#13;
reform support of one sort or another, but eventually the G-7 has come apart on their resistance to&#13;
it. The U.S. [inaudible] in China. Now, there's a political context for a very important&#13;
development issue that made it extremely difficult for us to function. We had planned a 2.3 billion&#13;
dollar program for China the fiscal year beginning July first after Tiananmen Square. We wound&#13;
up putting 700 million dollars in that year, and this year we will have put in about a billion and a&#13;
half, so we're creeping up toward a normal program again for a China of the size and poverty of&#13;
that country.&#13;
&#13;
But looking at this institution as a non-political institution from a political viewpoint is pretty&#13;
interesting.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, it certainly is.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Could I come back to the appointment just for a minute? Just after the decision was made&#13;
on both sides of--did you . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: With respect to myself?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yes, your own decision to accept. Did you have discussions with people in the U.S.&#13;
government with respect to what the government, U.S. government . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Expected?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Barber B. Conable&#13;
                               May 8 and August 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                       7&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: . . expected the role of the World Bank might be?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Baker told me I should come down early to learn something about the institution.&#13;
Then, as you may know--and this was very tough--the U.S. started raising hell with the budget Tom&#13;
Clausen submitted. Finally, two days before I took over, after Iâ&#128;&#153;d been here for 28 days, the Board&#13;
finally voted through the budget with the U.S., Japan, and France voting against the budget and&#13;
Britain and Germany abstaining.&#13;
&#13;
And I went to Jim Baker, and I said, "Jim, what have you done to me? You twisted my arm to&#13;
come in here, and now you've pulled the rug out from under me. What am I expected to do when&#13;
all my big donor nations will not support the administrative budget of this institution and make that&#13;
decision known two days before I take over. What do you expect of me?"&#13;
&#13;
And he said, "Well, what do you suggest?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Well, do you want me to sequester money and go back to zero growth?"&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Oh, you better not do that. You'd get in trouble."&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Well, then, the only other thing I can think of is to have a major reorganization."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Well, you've got a lot of fat over there."&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Well, I'm going to have to do something because I have a very clear demonstration of&#13;
no confidence on the part of my big countries, and I'm going to find out if a reorganization is&#13;
appropriate."&#13;
&#13;
So, what did I do? I got a consultant in. First of all I talked to David Rockefeller to see if he could&#13;
advise me. I talked to Bill [William F.] Pounds from MIT and Yale, and he came down and said, "I&#13;
can recommend some consultants for you."&#13;
&#13;
I talked to Bob McNamara. Bob said, "Oh, Barber, I wish I'd done this before I left. You've got to&#13;
do that.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
I said, â&#128;&#156;Would you serve on our reorganization committee because it will be reassuring to the Bank&#13;
if you will because you hired all these people.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
So gradually we whittled down the issues to the point where a number of the middle-level Bank&#13;
staff agreed to serve on a reorganization committee in an effort to try to recast the Bank in ways&#13;
that would be more flexible and more economical.&#13;
&#13;
And of course from there on we went downhill. There was tremendous criticism. Everybody&#13;
agreed the reorganization was necessary. Baker agreed that it was necessary because the&#13;
Europeans and Japanese felt their people had been hired for life here. I had to put together such a&#13;
rich separation package that I lost the support of the U.S. for the reorganization. And I had just a&#13;
terrible fight from the word "go" from the staff who had never had their right to their job here&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                         8&#13;
&#13;
challenged before. Bob McNamara had quadrupled the size of the Bank while he was here, and&#13;
McNamara was the toughest guy on my whole reorganization committee wanting to get rid of&#13;
people.&#13;
&#13;
We had about 500 redundancies, mostly burn-out cases, people that had, because they were good&#13;
technicians, had been risen into the management to the point where they wereâ&#128;&#148;the â&#128;&#156;Peter&#13;
Principleâ&#128;&#157; applied. We had a very, very tough time, and for two years my name was Barber B.&#13;
Mud here because I created the terrible disruption of that reorganization.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the whole philosophy of it was correct. We decided to decentralize, to eliminate three levels&#13;
of bureaucratic review, to ensure that managers were responsible for the people who worked for&#13;
them rather than having them assigned by central personnel so that if they got somebody they didn't&#13;
like, they just worked around them, put them in an office to shuffle papers. The managerial teams&#13;
were their own choice, and they had to accept responsibility for them. And clearly now, three to&#13;
four years later, the staff feels that we are leaner, even though we've grown some since then, that&#13;
we are more responsive, that procedures take less time, and that they know more where they stand&#13;
with their own managers than they used to. And so I think morale is generally pretty good now in&#13;
relation to the efficient use of the talents and motivation that brought the staff here in the first place.&#13;
But clearly for a long time the disruptive element involved in this reorganization was very severe.&#13;
They all blamed me for the implementation of it, which of course was carried out by my senior&#13;
managers, not by me. I didn't [inaudible] about the Bank. They blamed me for having gone into&#13;
the reorganization they all urged me to do at first, at the beginning. And my member countries--&#13;
every one of my executive directors--considered the reorganization a plot against his nationals who&#13;
got fired. It was tough.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Looking at it from outside, I had a feeling that one feature that generated so much panic&#13;
was this sort of musical chairs character, the fact that you announced that you were going to reduce&#13;
personnel and then you sort of set up an internal open labor market where people . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Picked their own people. The ones who weren't picked were declared redundant.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, and . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: And they felt that it created a "buddy system." I don't know how you could do it,&#13;
though--you know, the big problem was that under the old system nobody gave anybody a bad&#13;
performance rating, but when they had to choose their own team, somebody who had a perfect&#13;
performance rating would be left out, and he felt that was a terrible injustice and indicated that the&#13;
"buddy system" was under operation. But in fact what had happened was that nobody took any&#13;
responsibility for rating anyone as long as they were all assigned by central personnel. Nobody&#13;
wanted to say anything unpleasant, but when they had to decide who they wanted to work with&#13;
there were some guys that clearly could not be employed anywhere in the Bank. And that's what&#13;
happened, and a lot of them were fairly high-level people, too. As a matter of fact, a lot of people&#13;
got out, played their cards to avoid being chosen because there was such a rich separation package.&#13;

LEWIS: Do you feel that the dust now has settled and on the whole this came out as a pretty&#13;
positive thing?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: I think most people believe the Bank functions better today than it did and believe&#13;
that conceptually it is better designed to do its work than it was when people at the country level&#13;
knew their work was going to be reviewed three levels above them. They didn't have to be&#13;

&#13;
accountable for the decisions they made, and it meant also that the country people, country leaders,&#13;
didn't know with whom they were dealing. So I think in terms of accountability and transparency&#13;
itâ&#128;&#153;s far better. I believe alsoâ&#128;&#148;and speaking about the length of time between appraisal and&#13;
implementation--very substantial.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Would that be . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Now, you'll get different views from other people, in all probability. That's my&#13;
impression as an overall conclusion. There are some people that still are unhappy about the&#13;
reorganization. It depends on whether they got into a job they liked better or one they liked less.&#13;
And they of course have a tendency to blame whatever their own circumstances were on&#13;
reorganization.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: We were thinking that as you approached the end of this five-year run it would be&#13;
interesting just to have your quick sort of notion of what the main story line has been, as you see it.&#13;
What are theâ&#128;&#148;what are the big items, sort of?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Well, itâ&#128;&#153;s a dramatically changing world. The change in expectancy here has&#13;
resulted in many shifts in the way we function. And a number of operational initiatives which I&#13;
think would have had to occur whether I had been here or not: an acceptance, for instance, of the&#13;
tremendous overlap between environment and development; the need for a "women in&#13;
development" initiative where half the human race had been left out in significant ways of&#13;
development earlier on; tripling of the money going into primary education; at least a doubling of&#13;
the money going into forestry; a renewal of the poverty focus of the Bank because we had come to&#13;
believe during the early '80s that economic growth was valuable for its own sake, and we hadn't&#13;
learned yet that a lot of poor people fell through the cracks in an adjustment lending environment&#13;
which began about 1979 and which was mature by the time I arrived but which had resulted, for&#13;
instance, in substantial growth in Asia that simply bypassed the landless poor. We found we had to&#13;
target poverty much more than we had previously. We had to develop a strategy for dealing with&#13;
poverty. It was no longer to be assumed that "trickle down" would occur if we got economic&#13;
growth. And I think these reflect the sort of things that were going on.&#13;
&#13;
We made the processâ&#128;&#148;weâ&#128;&#153;ve had a tendency in this institution to rely on panaceas over the years,&#13;
and we made the process during the last five years increasingly complex by interweaving strands of&#13;
different operational initiatives in an effort to keep the poor from falling through the net somehow.&#13;
&#13;
I think that would be my interpretation of what's been happening, and I think it's appropriate, and I&#13;
don't claim a lot of credit for it. It certainly is difficult, more difficult to explain to a bunch of&#13;
finance ministers that aren't very interested in development in the first place but at least have&#13;
enough clout to be able, once they understand something, to go home and enforce it on their&#13;
cabinets.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: This new or revised strategy for the, for anti-poverty, supporting the poor, where did that&#13;
come from intellectually within the Bank?&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                    11&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: It came from the World Development Report 1990, last year's World Development&#13;
Report, which simply was, didn't cut a lot of new paths. It simply restated the basic message of the&#13;
1970s period which was that you have to understand that the poor have only their labor to sell, that&#13;
therefore capital-intensive project work is not a great idea, that you've got to try to find ways of&#13;
involving the poor in the development process, and that if you can backstop the value of their labor&#13;
with education and health programs, that their labor is worth more and therefore you get a better&#13;
redistributive effect from the economic activity in which they engage. Now, that's not a remarkable&#13;
new idea, but it was well stated in the 1990 World Development Report. It buttressed the earlier&#13;
theses which would have supported this general view with better evidence and therefore it had a&#13;
much more probative force on the world at large. There has been a very good acceptance of this&#13;
thesis now, and we find a lot of people willing to consider aid as properly directed to those&#13;
countries which have a poverty strategy and encourages developing countries to accept the poverty&#13;
strategy as a way to get more aid. In that way we think we make better use of the available money.&#13;
&#13;
Don't worry about this. What's happening in there is that the--we have a ten-year anniversary every&#13;
month for people who've been on the staff for ten years, and they're setting up that room in there. I&#13;
go out and give them a little lecture about how the World Bank appreciates their services, and I&#13;
shake hands with them in front of the globe. And they take a picture and I lovingly inscribe the&#13;
picture to them, and that tells them that they're appreciated. It's a very modest ceremony, but at&#13;
least somebody says "thank you" to them.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s very good. When do you do that?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: We do that at four.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: At four. Okay.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: But they're starting to set the room up, and they have to clear out furniture. That's&#13;
why we're meeting in here.&#13;
&#13;
Incidentally, that room used to be Bob McNamara's and Tom Clausen's office, but it's so big and so&#13;
impressive I felt like a damned high priest there and felt insignificant in such surroundings and so I&#13;
came in here. This was a little conference room, and I felt this was more intime. I don't like to&#13;
have a desk between me and the people I'm talking to, either. That's the way politicians are, you&#13;
know, always thinking of little symbolic things.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Your story line for the last five years, how do you see the debt issue?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: The debt issue has been important, because obviously debt is one of the major&#13;
obstacles to development. I was interested and supportive of the Brady plan. It has been used in&#13;
relatively few cases, but we consider many of the middle-income countries potential Brady&#13;
countries. The problem is they have to have a fairly strong track record in economic reform before&#13;
you can really use the Brady plan effectively. It's not enough to reduce debt for its own sake.&#13;
You've got to reduce it as part of a process of economic performance that will ensure that debt isn't&#13;
recreated again, and so--because otherwise just reducing debt for its own sake would simply be&#13;
disruptive of reasonable economic relations in the global economy.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                  12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Would you see it as something that has really hamstrung the Bank over the last five&#13;
years?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Well, a lot of the money we lend is diverted into debt service. We don't lend money&#13;
just to repay debt. We don't lend money unless there is a component of growth in the process&#13;
somewhere, but money is fungible and so obviously as we lend significant amounts of money some&#13;
of it does get diverted into debt service, and that means that it's not being used as effectively as&#13;
it should be. And we have to be accountable for the money we lend, so we believe it's important&#13;
that there be some sort of coherent way of dealing with debt and that in any scenario into which we&#13;
lend there be significant growth performance beyond any impact it could possibly have on debt.&#13;
&#13;
Debt is a big problem in the world. We're having a lot of difficulty with it right now because, while&#13;
we have a tool now in the Brady plan, for dealing with commercial debt of middle income&#13;
countries, while we have a tool in the Paris Club terms, in the Toronto terms, and possibly after the&#13;
next summit the Trinidad terms or one of those other initiatives for dealing with official debt&#13;
reduction for the poorest countries, we still have no coherent way of dealing with official debt&#13;
reduction for middle-income countries. And the result of that is that we have a bunch of very&#13;
sensitive Japanese who have been doing a lot of co-financing with us--they're quite forthcoming in&#13;
that respect--but who are just scared to death as a result of Poland and possibly Egypt that some&#13;
kind of a formula will be applied to their official debt (loaned out through co-financing with the&#13;
World Bank for the most part) some kind of a formula will be applied to that and that therefore&#13;
their taxpayers will suddenly not get more than a factional return on the loans they've made. So the&#13;
Japanese are very goosy right now, and we're having to spend a lot of time leaning over backwards&#13;
to explain that all official debt reduction for middle-income countries must be on a country-by-&#13;
country basis and that new money is very important for these countries and not just debt reduction--&#13;
to try to keep the Japanese in the game.&#13;
&#13;
One of the problems of recent years--and it's not because of the Brady plan; it was a problem before&#13;
the Brady plan--is that commercial banks have stopped lending because--they've stopped lending&#13;
for development, both because they lack the resources and because they feel quite burned as a&#13;
result of the excesses of the '70s when they were recycling a lot of petrodollars and didnâ&#128;&#153;t give a&#13;
damn. They were operating on the [Walter B.] Wriston theory that a sovereign never defaults.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Thereâ&#128;&#153;s also--the free-rider problem hasn't been solved.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: No, the free-rider has not been solved. They--there are lots of exit plans of one sort&#13;
or another that can mitigate the free-rider [inaudible] and so on.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Do you worry about the Bank getting more "front and center" and therefore more&#13;
exposed?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Sure I do. Our resources are large. Our commitment is total. It's inevitable as fewer&#13;
people lend that we'll get more exposure. And of course there are lots of people who believe that&#13;
we should be required to reschedule. They don't understand that currently we get only three&#13;
percent cash from our donors, that weâ&#128;&#148;that 97 percent comes from investment returns on our&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                   13&#13;
&#13;
liquidity from profit. We got a billion dollars of profit every one of the four years I've been here,&#13;
previously, and I think we'll have more than that this year--and that we borrow 12 billion a year&#13;
of the 16 or 18 that we lend through the IBRD [International Bank for Reconstruction and&#13;
Development]. People don't realize that and therefore we cannot reschedule and retain the kind of&#13;
credit rating we've got that permits us to borrow at low enough rates so that we can provide a major&#13;
service to our customers. So we have that problem, the problem of potential overexposure, a sense&#13;
that somehow we should be required no longer to exercise a preferential position among the&#13;
creditors but should reschedule also. If we start doing that, we're in trouble. We're in trouble&#13;
unless the nature of the institution changes, and we expect all our members to contribute money to&#13;
us instead of just the guarantees on which we go out and borrow money.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Is it [inaudible] to mention this is a very special issue in the case of Peru . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Well, the--some of our donor nations, France in particular, have served notice on us&#13;
that they will not put up additional money to help pay off arrears for this institution or the IMF&#13;
[International Monetary Fund]. Each of us is owed about a billion dollars by Peru, 300 million to&#13;
the IADB [Inter-American Development Bank]. So they want assurance that we will lend them&#13;
enough to cover our arrears. Now, we are not--remember, I told you earlier, we don't lend money&#13;
for the payment, repayment of debt. There has to be a growth component in there. So we have&#13;
been insisting on and indicating that we will lend for a normal program, that normally such a&#13;
program, given good performance, would result in significant enough loans to offset our debts, but&#13;
that we will not promise specifically to lend them enough money to cover our arrears, and they&#13;
don't like that. So it is a sensitive issue. They don't want to be held up to scorn and contumely&#13;
because they haven't come up with bridging loans or something of that sort and do not wish to&#13;
contribute to the repayment of IMF or World Bank money because they think of us as better off&#13;
than they are. Of course, the French are also very sensitive about the Cote dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Didn't the Bank also do it for Zambia recently, sort of?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: That was an IDA [International Development Association] country. It was quite&#13;
different. The money we put up there is not borrowed money; it's cash money on the line. We did&#13;
not, we also did not exceed our normal IDA entitlement for a country of that size and that poverty,&#13;
and in fact there were substantial contributions from bilateral donors there, something that we&#13;
cannot promise for Peru. So you could say that every country is different, though.&#13;
&#13;
And one of the realities you learn in this position is that everything is country-by-country. You talk&#13;
about Eastern bloc of Middle European countries or the emerging states bloc. One of the first trips&#13;
I took was to West Africa to understand the West African bloc problems. And I went to Nigeria&#13;
and Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire and Mauritania, and you couldn't have had four more different&#13;
countries in the world than those four countries right stretched along the coast of West Africa. So&#13;
everything is really country-by-country.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: The Bank seems to be thrust into more and more of a brokering role.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: We do an awful lot of aid coordination, a lot of so-called "catalytic work," and this is&#13;
one of our big problems on budget. Our traditional donors like to think the efficiency of the&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Bank can be determined by taking our aggregate lending and dividing it by the size of our staff.&#13;
The reality is that we're providing nowadays, in a much more complex development world than we&#13;
used to have, a tremendous amount of economic and sector work, a tremendous amount of&#13;
technical assistance, an awful lot of supervision work, and a coordination of aid that eats up&#13;
hundreds of staff years every year.&#13;
&#13;
For instance, in Africa, where we've made, as you know, a major commitment--half our IDA&#13;
money goes to Africa; that's roughly 3 billion dollars a year--but we have connected with IDA a&#13;
Special Program of Assistance, SPA it's called, where we use previously committed, bilateral ODA&#13;
[official development assistance], mostly from Europe, as co-financing with our IDA in Africa.&#13;
And that amounts to 8 billion dollars over three years; that, by itself, it almost doubles the amount&#13;
of IDA. Now, we have to spend a lot of time coordinating that bilateral aid to all the different&#13;
countries there so that it will be applied in coordination with our IDA lending in order to increase&#13;
the leverage for those countries that are in adjustment and to increase significantly the flow of&#13;
resources for a resource-starved continent. So there is something that takes a lot of our time.&#13;
&#13;
As a matter of fact, we have very significant trust fund money we administer now. Our--having&#13;
had a tight budget ever since I've been here, the average growth of the Bank administrative budget&#13;
over the last four years has been 1.1 percent in real terms. Now, it's been more than that in nominal&#13;
terms because we've had pay increases, and inflation has, affects this institution like anything else,&#13;
but in real terms it's been 1.1 percent. The pressure on our budget has resulted in a lot of our&#13;
people being entrepreneurial in going out and getting money for special purposes from bilateral&#13;
donors, and thus we administer now something like 321 trust funds, as well as using our own&#13;
resources. Now, that goes beyond, you see, the coordination of bilateral flows implicit in the SPA.&#13;
&#13;
You take something like our capacity-building initiative in Africa, which is over the next three&#13;
years to provide 100 million dollars to beef up some of the good regional universities in Africa for&#13;
purposes of economic management training. In Africa you've got more expatriates working now&#13;
than you had at the end of the colonial period. That's a devastating indictment of development. It&#13;
means that development is reversible there, that people are doing development for Africa, not&#13;
Africans doing it for themselves, and so we want to beef up their indigenous managerial capacities.&#13;
We're doing that through a capacity-building initiative. That's entirely money, except for roughly&#13;
15 million . .&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: . . that's a billion dollars, more than a billion dollars, that's being administered in&#13;
connection with our operational activities in cooperation with UNDP [United Nations Development&#13;
Program] and UNEP [United Nations Environment Program]--where we have to coordinate and&#13;
spend time on that as well--for the purpose of providing additional concessional money to IDA and&#13;
IBRD countries for global problems that transcend national boundaries. Now, I want to tell you,&#13;
we're putting a lot of staff years into that as well. So, you see, the old idea that somehow you can&#13;
determine the efficiency of the Bank program by dividing the number of staff into the aggregate&#13;
lending is a crazy idea.&#13;

&#13;
LEWIS: Is this increased coordination that you're doing in Africa related at all to the increased&#13;
field representation you have there?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: No, that's related more to the fact that we have adjustment programs in 30 of those&#13;
countries. You know, when you're operating with comparatively unsophisticated people,&#13;
inexperienced administrators, in policy programs, policy-related programs, you have to have close&#13;
dialogue with them. So the size of our resident representation abroad is increased sharply with the&#13;
increase in adjustment lending. Now, that was not realized until after I got here. We've greatly&#13;
expanded our resident representatives abroad in the past five years, largely because we found if we&#13;
didn't engage in very close dialogue with countries, with unsophisticated countries that were going&#13;
through the adjustment process, we would have severe problems of communication.&#13;
&#13;
Incidentally, that's another reason why our costs are under considerable pressure because it costs a&#13;
whale of a lot more to put, to maintain people overseas than it does to send out missions from here.&#13;
We have the largest American Express bill in the world for the travel that goes out here from the&#13;
Washington headquarters, but it would be much more expensive to maintain a higher level of&#13;
people overseas. As a matter of fact, our resident representatives are encouraged to hire local help&#13;
where possible, and they try to get nationals.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It's been a very highly-centralized organization over the years, and I myself am delighted&#13;
to hear that you are, even though it's expensive, going with more field representation.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Well, it makes us much more efficient in our relations with our members, with our&#13;
borrowing countries.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Thisâ&#128;&#148;maybe itâ&#128;&#153;s just an historical anecdote now, but this increased brokering roleâ&#128;&#148;if&#13;
you read the Articles of Agreement, it reallyâ&#128;&#148;one has a sense that that was the original idea, the&#13;
central idea for the Bank to . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Well, I think there were a lot of views that were, that have not squared with the&#13;
[noise drowning out words]. I hope we continue to learn from our mistakes and from our&#13;
experience here. I have the sense the institution has changed quite a bit, but largely because the&#13;
world is changing so fast and they expect to.&#13;
&#13;
You know, there's an awful tendency on the part of highly motivated and experienced people to&#13;
want to do what they're doing because they know they do it well, they've had experience doing it,&#13;
and they think it's the most important thing in the world. We've had a lot of problem getting any&#13;
redeployment of resources into new initiatives. That's why I've had to push so hard on operational&#13;
initiatives. You push an awful lot at the top to get a little movement down here at the bottom&#13;
because people are convinced they're doing significant work and they don't want to be told, "You've&#13;
got to cut that back so you can do something else." They say, "Give me more money if you're&#13;
going to expect me to do something else. Give me more resources with which to do it," instead of&#13;
saying, "All right, even though I know I do this well, I'm going to cut it back some in order to do&#13;
this new thing," this women in development initiative, let's say. The problem is that you can't&#13;
really afford in an institution like this to be supply-oriented if what you're doing is only--you're&#13;
&#13;

doing it only because you know you do it well, regardless of whether it's needed out there or not.&#13;
I'm afraid you're not, youâ&#128;&#153;re not maintaining your relevance.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It's pretty hard to do that slowly or smoothly and incrementally, isn't it? Maybe that's one&#13;
of the arguments for your reorganization, in fact.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Yes. That was one of the arguments at the time that we used, but I think it's a&#13;
legitimate argument.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Let me change . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: I hope we've covering the things you're interested in.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, we're covering them. We would probably like to get back at you again before you . .&#13;
.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Well, I'm a little concerned. I'm talking very frankly with you. Don't embarrass me&#13;
in this stuff.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: No, no, no. I think we'll be, not be harsher . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: You know, I have good human relations with my predecessors, and I hope with my&#13;
successor and with my staff here. I'm convinced this is a great institution, that it's tremendously&#13;
important and central in the world of development. And I don't want to appear to be overstating the&#13;
political elements, even though that's one of the things you seem to be interested in.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, yeah, you have to be. I think that--that just was one of things that you have&#13;
brought the institution is a greater track record that qualifies you to deal with the U.S. Congress.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Well, you mentioned that as a question, and I don't think that amounts to shucks.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It doesnâ&#128;&#153;t, huh?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Sure it's been a help that I knew people up in Congress and they wanted to help me.&#13;
That'sâ&#128;&#148;thatâ&#128;&#153;s nice. But, of course, I'm not supposed to lobby the Congress. If I go up and appear&#13;
before a committee of Congress, I've got to appear before every parliament in the world. So I'm not&#13;
supposed to have direct relations with legislative bodies. I'm supposed to be represented by the&#13;
finance ministries of the world before those legislative bodies.&#13;
&#13;
I must say that the U.S. Treasury is not a vigorous representative before the U.S. Congress and that&#13;
I have felt obliged from time to time to make phone calls to friends about things that were a matter&#13;
of particular concern where all Treasury wanted to do was talk about how high our salaries were.&#13;
You know, I have never yet had a member of Congress say to me, "You guys are paid too much."&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Really?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Barber B. Conable&#13;
                               May 8 and August 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                       17&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Nick Brady tells me when I go over there, "They never talk about anything up here&#13;
but how high you guys are paid. You guys have made it impossible for us to represent you in the&#13;
Congress." They never--I have never once had a Congressman mention that to me, and yet that's&#13;
what Treasury does. Unless they can keep us on the defensive all the time, they can't control us,&#13;
and they want to control us for the linkages that are involved. They want to be able to project a lot&#13;
of influence in this institution so they can get trade concessions from Japan or something else. I'm&#13;
pretty cynical about this.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Right, I . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: And Iâ&#128;&#148;and when they tell me, "We can't get the IFC [International Finance&#13;
Corporation] capital increase through up there because we can't get two things through at one time&#13;
and the IMF quota is up this year," they're talkingâ&#128;&#148;theyâ&#128;&#153;re whistling Dixie. We got more interest&#13;
in the IFC capital increase in Congress than we got here in the IBRD because that's related to the&#13;
private sector and because a lot of people believe itâ&#128;&#153;sâ&#128;&#148;up in Congress--itâ&#128;&#153;s one of the best parts of&#13;
the World Bank. But Treasury is afraid if they send up a bill with the IFC capital increase in it&#13;
along with a quota increase for the IMF that theyâ&#128;&#153;ll, that Congress will cherry-pick and pass the&#13;
IFC capital increase and won't pass the IMF quota increase. After all, [Charles H.] Dallara worked&#13;
for the IMF.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Do you have a sense of whether Treasury has been projecting more pressure on the Bank&#13;
latterly during your time than they did prior . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: I donâ&#128;&#153;t know.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You donâ&#128;&#153;t know about it.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: All I know is that the, that Nick's relative disinterest in this institution--he's had a lot&#13;
of problems, of course, with the S&amp;L's [savings and loans] and with the budget and everything&#13;
else--his relative disinterest in this institution has left the fate of the institution in the hands of&#13;
negotiators at the Treasury, people who are interested in the linkages that can be generated here and&#13;
interested in the opportunities that come with control, not people interested in this as a tool for&#13;
development or as a mode of cooperation. I can understand why Treasury is not terribly interested&#13;
in this institution. First of all, they can't control us. All they can do is control a vote for 17 percent&#13;
of the weighted voting in the Board. And they have not been able to deal with their partners very&#13;
satisfactorily here, so that means theyâ&#128;&#153;ve been pretty much by themselves on a lot of things.&#13;
&#13;
But also Title 150 of the U.S. budget is 91 and 1/2 percent under the control of the State&#13;
Department and 8 and 1/2 percent under the control of the Treasury. Now, Nick made a serious&#13;
effort to try to get another hundred million for us to maintain the purchasing power of IDA IX over&#13;
IDA VIII, and he couldn't get Baker to spring for a hundred million dollars to maintain that&#13;
purchasing power out of the 91 and 1/2 percent of the budget that he controlled, and he finally had&#13;
to generate it somehow out of the 8 and 1/2 percent that Brady controlled. So that's the way things&#13;
are here. We're kind of a step-child.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                               May 8 and August 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      18&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: There is certainly evidence that, I think, State doesn't have a hell of an interest in&#13;
development at this point.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Let me tell you another thing, and this isâ&#128;&#148;please, again, don't embarrass me on this.&#13;
&#13;
Jim Baker says something--Jim's my friend; I know him very well--Jim Baker says something to&#13;
Turkey at the time of the Gulf crisis that leads the Turks to say to us, "You gotta give us this money&#13;
without conditionality now."&#13;
&#13;
So I want to find out what Jim said to them. So I go over to State to talk to him. Dallara sees me in&#13;
the lobby of State; two days later I get called over to Treasury and told, "Look, Treasury is your&#13;
boss, not State. What are you doing over at State?"&#13;
&#13;
Two weeks ago I got honored by the G-7 Council. My American ED comes to see me here and&#13;
says, "Barber, I want you to know there's a lot of sensitivity about your going over to State for this&#13;
honor you're getting."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "What do you want me to do? Turn it down?"&#13;
&#13;
"Oh, no. I just want you to know there's a lot of sensitivity about that."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Why? What is the G-7 Council?"&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Well, I don't know, but it's organized by State." So I shouldn't be honored by them, you&#13;
see, because they're State. Now, I want to tell you, that's crap!&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It certainly is.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: And it sounds like the Japanese government . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I was going to say . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: . . with the relations between MITI [Ministry of International Trade and Industry]&#13;
and the ministry of finance. And I told George about this. I said, "George, your government is&#13;
coming apart at the seams. Treasury and State don't talk to each other, or at least if they do they&#13;
don't want me to talk to them both.â&#128;&#157; I'm turned off by that. Excuse me. My tongue is running&#13;
away with me here. Again, in writing the history of this institution, I hope you won't let my&#13;
personal remarks over sway you.&#13;
&#13;
What have we left out there? Well, we've covered most of it indirectly, one way or another.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Weâ&#128;&#153;ve touched on most.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You just mentioned relations withâ&#128;&#148;youâ&#128;&#153;ve talked some about your relations with the&#13;
Board, but you just mentioned Japan. Japan is playing financially a larger role. Did you see--is the&#13;
role a more active one?&#13;
&#13;
                                       Barber B. Conable&#13;
                               May 8 and August 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: The Japanese have a very good ED here now, a bright guy, but he's held on a very&#13;
tight tether by the ministry of finance. And the Japanese are not terribly demanding, no. I have&#13;
always said to the Japanese I hoped they would take a more independent role. They are very- they&#13;
tend to be quite subservient to U.S. Treasury interests. And so, although they have now as a result&#13;
ofiDA IX moved up to-no, IDA VIII, excuse me--moved up to the second largest shareholder in&#13;
the Bank, they have not tried to assert a much greater influence than they ever did.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It was just in the paper today, wasn't it, that [Attila] Karaosmanoglu had been talking in&#13;
Tokyo about a sort of closer working partnership between the Bank and Japan?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Well, I'm entirely in favor of that. I think the Japanese have been most forthcoming&#13;
in the way of co-financing and in their general outreach and extert;J.ally-oriented viewpoint, but in&#13;
fact they're not terribly assertive about their place in this institution.&#13;
&#13;
The one problem we have with the Japanese is that they raise absolute hell with us about staffing all&#13;
the time. The road to preferment does not lead through Washington for a Japanese man, and so it's&#13;
very hard to get people to accept a role in the World Bank.&#13;

&#13;
LEWIS: We have a good one at the Woodrow Wilson School this year, [Toyoo] Gyoten.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Well, Gyoten is top flight, and I made every effort to get him to accept a senior vice-&#13;
presidency here. He would not do it because he had his eye on something else. Gyoten is a man of&#13;
such reputation that he could move into a senior vice-presidency here very easily.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, I agree. He's very, very good.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Toyoo. Toyoo.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That's right. What else, Richard?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: [inaudible] sure of his name.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: In general, about the Board, you've already mentioned that you--again this year there&#13;
seemed to be troubles, protracted problems over the budget, and it almost seems to be a repeat of&#13;
Clausen' s last year . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Oh, I don't believe so. I think we'll have-they' ll be able to get it through without&#13;
major defections. There' ll be some. The U.S. will vote against it, of course; they always do.&#13;
Probably the Canadians because the Canadian ED is very close to the U.S. ED.; certainly the&#13;
&#13;

                              May 8 and August 19,1991- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                       20&#13;
&#13;
Australians, who have no money and always make no bones about no money, spending by the&#13;
World Bank, and believe that they have been bypassed largely because of their remoteness;&#13;
possibly the Japanese if the U.S. gets to them. However, while that's a large block, itâ&#128;&#153;sâ&#128;&#148;you could&#13;
still have a close to 30 percent negative vote on it and 70 percent positive. I don't expect to win&#13;
them all.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I mean, in the largest sense, then, how do you see these factors that go on the budget&#13;
affecting the way the institution does its work?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Well, if we had a repetition of what happened the year before I got here, it would be&#13;
devastating to confidence. Don't forget what I told you there, that the U.S., Japan, and France&#13;
voted against the budget and Britain and Germany abstained. It passed by a vote of something like&#13;
27 percent to 25 percent or something of that sort. It was devastating at that time. I don't think that&#13;
will occur. I may be wrong, but we don't see it on the horizon at this point.&#13;
&#13;
We will probably have 2 percent real growth this year, assuming that they accept what we're&#13;
negotiating at this point. That is not astonishing. We have, however, a very large wage increase&#13;
this year that has increased the nominal growth significantly. And that results from the U.S.'s pay&#13;
formula, which they have never supported after having forced it on us, for a pay increase in the&#13;
Fund and the Bank. It involved using comparators rather than a cost of living adjustment, and the&#13;
big comparators in the public sector were U.S. civil service, half; one-quarter, French civil service;&#13;
one-quarter, German civil service; and then comparators in a number of corporations nationally and&#13;
internationally for the private sector, for the other half of the comparators of higher-level staff.&#13;
Dallara held out for this for more than three years and finally got it. They have never supported it&#13;
since then, because this resulted in larger pay increases than they wanted to support. This year it&#13;
resulted in a pay increase, a structural increase, of 8.3 percent, which is considerably more than the&#13;
cost of living. Why? Because, first, the American comparator, half the public side of the&#13;
comparator, was affected by a $25,000 Congressional salary increase, which is feeding through the&#13;
whole system, of course. Then you had the decline in the value of the dollar before the February 1&#13;
cut-off date for the comparators. It was way down, as you know, which meant that the relative&#13;
value of the French and German was high, and then you had the Germans knocking off a small&#13;
payroll tax last year so that the net pay for German civil servants was considerably higher before&#13;
the February 1 cut-off date. Since then it's been raised again. Now, we bent the formula as much&#13;
as we could to keep the pay increase which otherwise would have been 13 percent down to 8.3, but&#13;
we had to try to preserve the system because otherwise the only way to have a salary increase&#13;
would beâ&#128;&#148;politically--just pick a figure out of the air and say, "This is what it's going to be." But&#13;
again the Americans would not support it, even though that was the Dallara formula.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: We've been having a sort of hypothesis that the president of this institution is very&#13;
important as a--I mean in the sense that once you're in place, you do have a lot of clout. It really&#13;
depends--when you compare the reins on you that are placed by the Board to the reins on the&#13;
executive branch that used to be placed by the Congress, that the executive here has more&#13;
discretion, doesn't he?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Well, we have more discretion than they do at the Fund. The Fund has a much&#13;
narrower scope of decision-making, and the Board can take a more active role there in the Fund.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                     21&#13;
&#13;
Here the work of development is as broad as human experience. It requires a high degree of skill.&#13;
We don't have the stability of the Fund board. Our Board, most of the members tend to tum over&#13;
every two years. The result is that almost by default it becomes a management-run institution. Of&#13;
course, the management is--the president is in the middle. He's the chairman of the Board and the&#13;
president of the management. I feel myself.constantly pulled two ways by everything, and clearly&#13;
that puts me in a very strategic role. I have to tell you, though, that most of the things I've pointed&#13;
to as possible accomplishments--operational initiatives, things like that--! think would have&#13;
happened anyway, whether I had been here or not. I think they're part of a democratic institution's&#13;
response to a changing world expectancy. It's very difficult for any institution that's receiving a lot&#13;
of outside stimuli not to react to them in some way. But clearly that's the reputation this institution&#13;
has of being a presidential-led institution.&#13;
&#13;
I'll tell you, the first two years I was here I spent most of my time trying to find out how decisions&#13;
had been made, not making them myself. And my impression is that most of the things that come&#13;
to that desk are turf problems. There's a tremendous amount of entrepreneurial activity goes on&#13;
here in a big cross-cultural bureaucracy like ours as people struggle to control aspects of the&#13;
development process. And so I have to make a lot of decisions of an administrative nature relating&#13;
to jurisdiction. It's a tough job, from that point of view. In Congress, you pick your issues, you&#13;
keep your head down, you can be a hero when you want to be, you can stay out of it when you&#13;
don't, and you can't do that here. Whatever comes to that desk has to be dealt with, and what comes&#13;
to that desk is trouble. You're making half the world mad at you.&#13;
                                                                                                                    ~&#13;
                                                                                                          -i&#13;
LEWIS: We notice that--we've been looking at the, some of the minutes of the president's council.&#13;

You do have to spend quite a lot oftime on housekeeping kinds of things.                                  c::::l&#13;
                                                                                                          c-'1&#13;

                                                                                                                    t.â&#128;¢.1&#13;
                           But I was told that they'd spend sometimes two days on a complex issue,&#13;
trying to arrive at a consensus. Very difficult to do when you've got strong personalities like&#13;
Moeen Qureshi and Ernie Stem who are not always on the best of possible terms. And so I decided&#13;
when I came here that I would let them advise me, we' d--everybody'd have his say, and then I'd&#13;
make the decision. I have to say that I don't ordinarily make decisions that do not have significant&#13;
support in the president's council, bu~ clearly I wanted to preserve the right to stop short of a&#13;
consensus if possible. And it has saved us a lot oftime. The president's council meets only two&#13;
mornings a week and never goes over to the afternoon--or almost never--while the Board meetings&#13;
go on two full days a week here. It's a terrible way to run a store, isn't it!&#13;
&#13;
LEWI S: Well, maybe we should let you go on to run your store.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Well, we've got a good ten minutes before the tenth anniversary meeting. You might&#13;
be interested in staying for that for a little and seeing, listening to what goes on. [All talking at&#13;
once.] You can do what you want It will be next door, right in this big room, and I'll just get up&#13;
and say a few words of appreciation.&#13;

&#13;
LEWIS: You got any words of advice to us as to how do you think this history job ought to be . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: I would hope you will approach the institution sympathetically, that's all. And I hope&#13;
that also, although I've talked very frankly with you--I haven't held anything back here in this&#13;
discussion and please don't embarrass me too much with the people that I've got to live with. If you&#13;
would say something, say it gently, in other words, because I would rather talk frankly with you&#13;
and rely on your judgment on this than I would hint darkly at a lot of stuff and leave you in doubt&#13;
as to what I'm saying.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: We would enormously prefer to have you talk frankly and weâ&#128;&#153;ll try to play our part in the&#13;
game. And we will certainly want to . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: You're both from Brookings, aren't you?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Well . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: We're both part-time . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: For the moment.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: . . temporarily. Richard is [talking at once]&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: You know, I spoke at Brookings more than any other member of Congress when I&#13;
was, in the twenty years I was there.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I once was a staffer at Brookings. Again, I was not in town. They sent me over to India&#13;
back in '59 and '60, but this thing, as you know, you made a decision that it should be situated&#13;
somewhere outside of the Bank and that Brookings was a good place to park this one as you did&#13;
with the [Edward S.] Mason-[Robert E.] Asher one earlier. And Brookings had talked with me&#13;
about making a proposal, and we got Richard aboard, and so now we are--Devesh is a full-time&#13;
Brookings employee.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Oh you are, huh? My dear friend Bill [William E.] Frenzel has gone over there now.&#13;
He and I were the "curmudgeon caucus" up on the Hill, the two of us, back to back, voting against&#13;
everything.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I've heard that. They had a public radio [inaudible] about Brookings's 75th anniversary&#13;
and saying it was getting "balanced up" again in political terms.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Well, it has a reputation of being a stable for old Democratic warhorses during&#13;
Republican administrations, but I . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: But they were saying . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: . . I was a Republican, and I spoke there more than anybody else. [E. William]&#13;
Proxmire and I used to debate each other on the economy once a month there for several years.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well back then, in the days of the '30s, in New Deal days, it was regarded as quite a&#13;
conservative think tank. Edwin G. Nourse, the first chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers&#13;
...&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Its constitution changes from time to time.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah. But it's a good place to--I know a lot of that, those refugees from the Democratic&#13;
administrations. I know Charlie [Charles L.] Schultze.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: He's a good guy.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: A very good guy. Youâ&#128;&#153;re going to be . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: I like Bruce [MacLaury], too.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, he's very good to us and interested in the project.&#13;
&#13;
We're going to be trying not to get--do you realize that we have access to something like 65,000&#13;
cubic feet of your records?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: I was aware of how much that was when I went to give my papers to Cornell when I&#13;
left Congress. I had 7,000 cubic feet, and that seemed like a tremendous amount.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That's a lot for one person. My goodness. Tremendous!&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Well, you know, it was mostly junk! Mostly form letters. So how much did you say&#13;
you've got?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Sixty-five thousand cubic feet.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Oh, no, no, no, excuse me. Mine was 700, 700 cubic feet. Sixty-five thousand! Oh,&#13;
heavens!&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: A lot of it's up in the salt mine, you know, in Pennsylvania. Well, the problem, of&#13;
course, is how in the world do you tap into that mass in any sort of responsible way, and we don't&#13;
really know the answer, but . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: I doubt that it's that well organized, either.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Itâ&#128;&#153;s getting . . .&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Itâ&#128;&#153;s very poorly organized. The Archives of the Bank are . . .&#13;

&#13;
CONABLE: As a matter of fact, very little was done on that for the first couple of years I was&#13;
here. I was astonished to find how little archival interest there was, and I've been trying to get it&#13;
organized some lately, but it's still got a long ways to go.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Institutional memory is very . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Yes, but the big problem again is budgetary.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, the vice-presidencies have their own libraries, don't they, documentary libraries?&#13;
And they seem, some of them, to be in pretty good shape.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: The problem with the Bank is that people move all the time, and as they move they&#13;
discard. And there is no systematic . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: I wish I discarded more than I do.&#13;
&#13;
Well, good luck in the project.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Thank you very much. You're going to be leaving the job when?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: September first.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, we'll certainly be back before that. Weâ&#128;&#153;d like to get back at you again.&#13;

CONABLE: Well, you go over this stuff you might find there are a lot of holes here . .&#13;

&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: . . my own purposes later on to see what happened between the Bank and AID [U.S.&#13;
Agency for International Development] and the government of India back in the '60s. He was very&#13;
sharp-tongued even back in those days [inaudible], but very, very interesting and . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Well, there were a lot of people who were deeply distressed by the reorganization&#13;
here. It was an extremely disruptive experience for the Bank. The Bank had a kind of--not&#13;
complacency but a sense that it was somewhat invulnerable to change, and they saw this as an&#13;
American conspiracy, which it was not. As a matter of fact, I got very little help from the U.S.&#13;
government in reorganization. I came here with a vote of no confidence ringing in my ears. This&#13;
happened two days--I was completely unaware that this was happening until two days before I&#13;
came on board, and the vote in the Board was such that I realized that there was tremendous&#13;
unhappiness with the way the institution was functioning.&#13;
&#13;
And I went to Baker, and I said, "What do you expect me to do?â&#128;&#157; I said, â&#128;&#156;You twisted my arm and&#13;
brought me here, and then you guys organized the vote that puts me in a position where I've got to&#13;
turn the place upside down or do something. What do you want me to do? Do you want me to&#13;
sequester all funds above zero growth?"&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Aw, that won't work."&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Well, what do you want then? You want a reorganization?"&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Well, that's something you should consider, but I'm not telling you you've got to have&#13;
one."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Well, you're telling me something, and I don't know what it is, and I'm going to have&#13;
consult."&#13;
&#13;
Of course, the staff here all wanted a reorganization, you know; it was sensed somehow that the&#13;
institution had become too centralized. And of course by the time I had satisfied the Europeans and&#13;
the Japanese that we were not going to put people out in the cold, cruel world without a significant&#13;
severance package, the U.S. decided we were paying them too much. And I got into a real cross-&#13;
ruff. I learned a lot about politics the first few years I was here and found it quite instructive, not&#13;
necessarily happily so.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah. We sent you . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Excuse me. You sent me something, and I haven't had a chance to look at it. So you&#13;
can give me a case ofâ&#128;&#148;you can get a case of first impressions from me.&#13;

&#13;
LEWIS: All right. Okay. Well, we've got a whole long list of things here.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Do you want me to look at it?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, sure.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: â&#128;&#156;The length of term of Bank presidents as related to the age of an incumbent.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
Well, obviously, it's desirable to have vigorous younger people, if possible, if you can find people&#13;
that are recognized as people of international stature. It is not a good idea to pluck some&#13;
unsuccessful politician from somewhere because he's young and put him in here or even someone&#13;
who has not achieved some degree of success in business because the perception of this institution&#13;
is of a president-dominated institution.&#13;
&#13;
Now, as to the length of term, I think continuity is important. It has to be balanced against,&#13;
however, the need for a frequent infusion of new ideas.&#13;
&#13;
And I want to tell you, most of the people who are here are thoroughly committed to their work and&#13;
believe what they are doing is important. People who believe what they are doing is important do&#13;
not want to be capricious about their work and, therefore, tend to become quite stable in it. They&#13;
know what they do well because they've done it for a while, and they're highly motivated and don't&#13;
want somebody micromanaging them. And accountability requires that they not be micromanaged.&#13;
On the other hand, unless somebody looks around outside the institution, decides what's happening&#13;
to the world out there, unless somebody challenges them to be relevant to the world as it is and not&#13;
the world as their supply-oriented institution would like to think it is--because they're comfortable&#13;
doing what they're doing and believe that they're doing the most important work in the world--&#13;
unless somebody comes along and presses them to test them and encourages operational initiatives&#13;
that will be responsive, not reactive but responsive, to change, why the institution quickly becomes&#13;
irrelevant.&#13;
&#13;
I want to tell you, I've said to a lot of people, â&#128;&#156;I may have been here only five years, but I've had&#13;
about twenty years of experience in that five years!â&#128;&#157; And thereâ&#128;&#153;s been a tremendous amount of&#13;
change. Who could have anticipated what was going to happen in Eastern Europe when I came&#13;
here? Who could have anticipated the Gulf crisis? Who in the world would have ever said this&#13;
institution would be asked to take over a global environmental fund? When I came here there&#13;
wasn't even an environmental division here or--and as far as the world at large was concerned, the&#13;
Bank was the villain with the black moustache on environmental issues. Why do we have the&#13;
Global Environmental Fund? Because there's nowhere else for it to go. We had to do it. We had&#13;
to be responsive to a changing global environment with respect to that. So the point is: it is&#13;
important to have somebody here in the management who has not been here forever and is willing&#13;
to cast an eyeball outside the Bank at what the changing expectancies are in the world.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Wouldn't you say that--I think there is quite a perception . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: So all I'm saying is you've got to find some balance between continuity and an&#13;
infusion of new ideas and enthusiasms in the managerial level.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                      27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: But it--wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t it be a misunderstanding of your own pattern here to say that you went&#13;
through this very difficult reorganization thing, which you've explained to us quite a bit, but&#13;
then you've been on sort of a rising curve of really getting to these new initiatives, areas of&#13;
emphasis, identified and pushed. And you seem to be on a growth curve when the five years runs&#13;
out.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: You've got to balance that also against my age.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, sure.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: And so I would agree that it's desirable to get younger people. That has not&#13;
happened. They--I told the President that he must choose somebody of international stature or he&#13;
might be challenged on whether an American should lead the Bank. And, of course, he went to&#13;
somebody who was unquestionably of international stature, but he was 64 years old, is 64 years&#13;
old. And he thought I was younger than he was. Couldn't imagine why I was leaving at this&#13;
moment.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, I think that . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: So I haven't got a ready answer for you. There aren't any easy answers on things of&#13;
this sort. And it's got to be a matter of balance. I do believe that continuity is important, and I don't&#13;
have any doubt that, were I to stay for another five years, I'd find I was repeating myself. And I do&#13;
believe that it is easier to change a man functioning at the level of judgment, which is what a&#13;
president must do, than it is to change rapidly people who function at the level of skill and hands-&#13;
on negotiation with governments.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Do you see some change in the qualifications that the Bank president [inaudible] maybe&#13;
more, more political?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: I think, I personally think that's not a bad idea, to have people who have some sense&#13;
of development and of political procedure and political values in general. I worry about my--if I&#13;
worry about my successor at all, it is only that he has some sense that his financing skills will serve&#13;
him well here. I'll bet I spent 2 percent of my time on financing work. I deal almost entirely with&#13;
development issues and with relations with governments. I've just been having an interesting talk&#13;
with the Jordanians--right while you were waiting--and trying to assure the staff that the Jordanians&#13;
understood that they had a serious problem, trying to assure the Jordanians that the staff understood&#13;
they had a serious problem, and the two of them were each maneuvering to try to say what they&#13;
thought was important and were talking past each other too much. Well, I think it's valuable to&#13;
have somebody who's somewhat sensitive toâ&#128;&#148;Iâ&#128;&#153;ll tell you--politics.&#13;
&#13;
I'll tell you, the governmental people always greeted me by saying they knew I was a, had been a&#13;
member of Congress and understood their problems. Now, I think you can overstate that, too. I&#13;
don't believe--I think it's more the qualities of heart and mind you got in your leader are much more&#13;
important than any specific type of background you have. I--I think so.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Bank/Fund relationship: the circumstances that led to disagreements between the Argentina&#13;
episode.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
Well, it was largely the United States that caused the problem there. Jim Baker pressed me to go&#13;
into a major adjustment. He wanted to help--what was his name? [Raul R.] Alfonsin. He wanted&#13;
to help Alfonsin, and Michel [Camdessus] had dug his heels in and said, "Not unless in this&#13;
election year you get your deficit down to zero." And Baker was angry about that and goaded me&#13;
to go into it. I was assured of strong U.S. support. Baker immediately left to run George Bush's&#13;
campaign, and David Mulford, who had sat in the room and said nothing during the entire time,&#13;
decided that it was a big mistake to let Conable run it and pulled the rug out from under me and&#13;
encouraged other people to resist it. We got it through, but--and we designed it in such a, we&#13;
designed the thing in such a way that it would need very little up-front money. Everything would&#13;
be dependent on achieving certain results.&#13;
&#13;
But Camdessus was furious, obviously, about our moving ahead with a country that did not have a&#13;
Fund program and undercutting him and heâ&#128;&#153;d laid the line down to Alfonsin. And it was--because&#13;
of Mulford's encouragement, decided it was time to get us out of the adjustment business,&#13;
adjustment lending, and wanted all macroeconomic decisions that the Fund had primacy, meaning&#13;
we couldn't do anything without their approval, unless they accepted investment lending.&#13;
&#13;
Well, we negotiated all spring about this. And I was quite bitterly resentful of what my&#13;
government was doing to me.&#13;
&#13;
I've been that way on several occasions.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And Michel Camdessus is not bashful about . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: No, and he's a very bright, knowledgeable guy. And I had some people in my&#13;
management who wanted to turn tail and run, and I had a very difficult negotiation. We have had&#13;
no problem since we got that thing signed, and weâ&#128;&#153;ve--I was able to maintain the basic concept that&#13;
while they have the right to set overall macroeconomic goals, we have the right to vary the&#13;
elements that make up those goals, that we can advocate cutbacks instead of tax increases if that's&#13;
what we think is appropriate. But we can do the restructuring, the sectoral conditionality that&#13;
creates the elements of a macroeconomic program, the overall pattern of development [inaudible]&#13;
Weâ&#128;&#153;ve worked out--we've worked well together since then. And you know we always, even during&#13;
this period of contention, we had no problem of interface at the staff level.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I was going to say I'd be surprised if, given the big development of macroeconomics&#13;
within the Bank from the, at least from the beginning of the '70s now, I'm surprised that there&#13;
would be any senior people in the Bank whoâ&#128;&#153;d want to cede all macroeconomic sort of turf to the&#13;
Fund.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Well, I don't think there were many, but there were a lot of people who wanted to&#13;
argue about where we had to make concessions and considerable concern over the extent to which&#13;
the G-10 got into us, dictate to us. It was a very difficult period.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
WEBB: Do you deal often with Camdessus?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Quite a bit, yes. Iâ&#128;&#153;ve established the pattern of having regular monthly luncheons&#13;
with him with an agreed-upon agenda, and we've had--one is at his private dining room; the next&#13;
one is at my private dining room. We have three people from each side, depending on what the&#13;
subject matter is, the agenda is, and . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Plus yourselves?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Plus ourselves. And we go right down the list. Weâ&#128;&#153;ve behaved with discipline about&#13;
it. Theyâ&#128;&#153;ve been for the most part genial opportunities for an exchange of views to be sure that we&#13;
are on the same wave-length with respect to country issues, with respect to administrative issues,&#13;
things like salaries and all the various opportunities for entertainment and fun. And it's been a very&#13;
successful institution. It was something that apparently was not done previously or, if it was done,&#13;
it was done very sporadically. We've done it very religiously every time, and that's been helpful.&#13;
My relations with Michel are quite good.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: We heard there is quite a healthy volume of correspondence [inaudible] from the vice&#13;
presidentâ&#128;&#153;s office.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Mm-hmm, I think so. We donâ&#128;&#153;tâ&#128;&#148;we still have--the problems are not of cross-&#13;
conditionality. They're problems of disagreement about facts or something of that sort, and we are&#13;
always running into different assumptions on oil prices or something, and then our Boards get&#13;
upset. But, you see, we also have more contact than we used to have. For instance, the policy&#13;
framework papers provide a point of contact. I don't think they're terribly significant myself, but&#13;
those are worked out on a tripartite basis; the government, the Fund, and the Bank work out the&#13;
policy framework papers. And we discuss them, and a Fund man comes and listens to the&#13;
discussion. And we send our conclusions over to them, and they act on them ultimately. And&#13;
theyâ&#128;&#153;veâ&#128;&#148;and because that's been an element of country strategy that was visible to the Board, it&#13;
has tended to be upgraded in terms of the Boards who all want to have something to say about who&#13;
gets loaned what money. The Board has been significantly intrusive in recent years in terms of&#13;
wanting to get a bigger handle on real decisions.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Policy framework papers have been pushed more by the Fund than . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Well, they have more relevance to the Fund than they do to us. Our country&#13;
strategies have been pretty much management strategies.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yes, yes, yes.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: But the policy framework paper is something the Bank needs as a preliminary to&#13;
enhanced, to an E-S-A-F, ESAF [extended structural adjustment facility].&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;IFC capital increase and private sector development and could the Bank have tried to lend to the&#13;
private sector without government guarantees by simply increasing its own lending to the IFC?â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Barber B. Conable&#13;
                              May 8 and August 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   30&#13;
&#13;
Oh, I suppose so, but of course the IFC is--we have a lot of separatism over in the IFC. They feel&#13;
that they're kind of the stepsons over there.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And they feel they don't have the same sort of country strategy uses.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Well, they don't give a damn about strategies; they want deals. They're a deal-&#13;
oriented institution, and that's fairly appropriate, too.&#13;
&#13;
Now, the problem that the U.S. exploited some in the current negotiation, the recent negotiation we&#13;
had with them, was that the IFC doesn't want to have to draw its conclusions about the environment&#13;
in which it's lending, doesn't want to have a lot of policy people. It wants to send people out and&#13;
make deals and that's the end of it, and then let's work on, start working on the next deal. The&#13;
Bank, of course, in its adjustment lending, has to know something about the overall environment,&#13;
therefore the private sector among other things, and they would like to be able to consult with the&#13;
Fund, with the IFC, about what the problem is in Hungary anyway. And so the U.S. insisted on the&#13;
IFC setting up a small policy unit centrally that would then advise the Bank--not the government,&#13;
but the Bank--about economic environments in areas where the IFC is lending so the Bank could&#13;
then build that into their structural change requirements and improve the economic environment in&#13;
the context.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Now, to whom was that offensive?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: It wasn't offensive to anybody but to Bill [William S.] Ryrie, who didn't want to have&#13;
to put six or seven staff years into a group that wasn't out making deals. It ran up his expenses, and&#13;
it meant somebody was going to have to be disturbing all those deal-makers out there to try to draw&#13;
some conclusions from the deals they were making.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: But the U.S. position . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: But the U.S. position was in support of that. That was one thing on which we&#13;
agreed. But, you know, we had considerable confusion with the U.S. about this. As it started out&#13;
with Dallara and [E. Patrick] Coady, they seemed to want to--they wanted us to be able to make&#13;
loans directly to the private sector without government guarantees in the IBRD.&#13;
&#13;
And we took the position, â&#128;&#156;Well, that that's what we organized the IFC for. We don't see it would&#13;
do any good except to short-circuit the IFC.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
And David Mulford later said, "Well, that wasn't what we wanted at all." But he was not really&#13;
involved until after Dallara left.&#13;
&#13;
And so we were quite confused about what they really wanted. We have agreed to make a study of&#13;
it, but there's very little support for it anywhere. And I'm not even sure that, from what Mulford&#13;
said, that the U.S. wants it now. It's one of the things we spent a tremendous amount of time on!&#13;
So it was confusing. It was a very confusing negotiation. We spent most of our time trying to get&#13;
the U.S. to clarify what it wanted, and frequently it was a moving target.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Barber B. Conable&#13;
                              May 8 and August 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     31&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And I would think that a lot of other members wouldn't have been all that offended by,&#13;
for example, giving the Bank the--except for having this whole business of amending the Articles, I&#13;
guess, which is sort of a big deal, but substantively that shouldn't have been too offensive to a lot of&#13;
members, making loans to the private sector without government guarantees.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Well, there was a lot of concern in the finance department about whether it would&#13;
affect our ratings.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: And there was concern about confusion as to what our function was.&#13;
&#13;
This was part of a pattern of concern among other countries that the U.S. somehow had decided on&#13;
the private sector as an end in and of itself. Most people accept the global consensus about the--&#13;
that market forces make for greater economic efficiency, but there are a lot of folks here who are&#13;
very development-oriented. They want to be reassured constantly that the goal of the Bank is to&#13;
reduce poverty, and if somehow the goal of the Bank seems to have shifted to creating a private&#13;
sector qua private sector, they're going to be upset about it. So I've been constantly trying,&#13;
repeating the refrain, â&#128;&#156;The goal is to reduce poverty; the private sector is one of our more effective&#13;
modalities of doing that, but it is only a modality.â&#128;&#157; They were afraid the U.S. had made it an end in&#13;
itself.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: So they really perceived it as an ideological kind of thrust.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Yes. They were afraid of that.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Military expenditure, environment, and governance. How much does it complicate the&#13;
institution's own governance when it enters these contentious issues?â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
Well, governance and military expenditure obviously are matters of concern to sovereign nations,&#13;
and they are very sensitive in terms of sovereignty. And clearly we would be in a, we would have a&#13;
difficult time developing a significant military expertise which has very little to do with&#13;
development, and so we have to be careful about not promising too much in terms of military . . .&#13;
&#13;
Let me just give you an analogy here on the governance issue and suggest the nature of the&#13;
concerns among the Part IIs. Back in the beginning of this country the American Indians were&#13;
quickly under the dominance of the Europeans when they came, but as long as they could play the&#13;
French off against the English, they became quite skillful diplomats at doing that and maintaining&#13;
some relations with each and benefiting from the duality. For many reasons we don't need to go&#13;
into of an economic nature they finally, the key tribes in the eastern, northeast of the country, sided&#13;
with the British who were settlers, not fur traders. And their siding with the British was decisive in&#13;
throwing the French out. To their horror, the Indians in my neck of the woods discovered the&#13;
British no longer gave them gifts and told them, "You've got to do this, you've got to do that if you&#13;
want to get anything from us."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Barber B. Conable&#13;
                               May 8 and August 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      32&#13;
&#13;
Now, there's a somewhat similar situation here at the end of the Cold War. As long as there was a&#13;
confrontation between two great superpowers and people could choose sides and play both sides,&#13;
the conditionality was pretty limited. Many of the Part IIs now see a pyramid of conditionality.&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Now they want democracy as a condition, and they want to define democracy in their own ways.&#13;
Now they want to start leaning on you. The sinners all of a sudden are the ones who buy military&#13;
goods, not the ones who sell it, and all of a sudden the sinners are the ones who produce drugs, not&#13;
the ones who buy it.â&#128;&#157; And all of a sudden the Part IIs see the Part Is as irrationally putting pressure&#13;
on them to conform, and they see that as one of the complications as a result of the demise of the&#13;
Soviet Union as a force. And so thereâ&#128;&#153;s a lot of sensitivity. They're looking, they're watching us to&#13;
see what we're going to do next.&#13;
&#13;
And this coincides, of course, with the G-7, with its 52 percent of the weighted vote, saying, "No&#13;
more loans to China," and all the Part IIs thinking, "My god, the next thing they're going to do is&#13;
theyâ&#128;&#153;re going to say, 'No more loans to Zaire or Ethiopia or somebody else whoâ&#128;&#153;s worse than China&#13;
but doesn't happen to be in the sights right now.â&#128;&#153;â&#128;&#157; And there's been a general sense of pyramiding&#13;
conditionality and increasing stridency in the imperatives imposed by this institution on the Part IIs.&#13;
And it's something that needs to be worried about because this institution should be the property of&#13;
all its owners, not just those who happen to have a little heavier-weighted vote. And that's why&#13;
somebody in my position winds up spending a lot of time trying to look at things from the point of&#13;
view of the Part IIs rather than simply following the orders of Treasury.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That's a very good, telling analogy, and it runs just the opposite direction of what I had&#13;
sort of perceived, namely that maybe the Part IIs were a little less sensitive now about having&#13;
people wag their fingers at them about military expenditures than they used to be. I--your&#13;
predecessor, George Woods, almost got nailed to the wall when he, in the course of the&#13;
negotiations with the Indians in 1965 spring, about the [Bernard R.] Bell mission report and so on,&#13;
brought up the subject of military spending. He did it at the behest of the State Department, I think,&#13;
from reading correspondence, and it was a no-no. Now, the Indians are very sensitive about some&#13;
of these things anyway, but I had sort of a sense that the dialogue or the community had, the&#13;
development community had become more and more sort of desensitized to the whole issue of&#13;
military spending.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Well, I think theâ&#128;&#148;you know, the thing I hear in my Board about governance and&#13;
military is, "It's hard to talk about these things generally. We believe it's important, too, and we're&#13;
going to talk to our people and say, 'Look, this is important to your welfare,' but don't send out&#13;
some young professional to talk to my president and dictate to him." And that's what I hear all the&#13;
time, a sense somehow that the growing consensus means that everybody wants to get into the act&#13;
and that everybody has a different view of what is the right type of military.&#13;
&#13;
You know, there are all kinds of military services. There's the big standing army, there's the&#13;
national guard with the people participating, there's the army that's used for internal security as well&#13;
as for external threats, there's the government which spends a lot of money on F-16 fighters when&#13;
they got starving people, and you'll find a mixed bag everywhere. But one big concern is they still&#13;
want to have control of it themselves. Whatever the consensus may be globally, they don't want to&#13;
have an institution like this dictating to them about it. It's a sensitive area of national sovereignty,&#13;
and I think there's a growing sensitivity about that, even though as you say there is a. . .&#13;

God, I went to the--I spoke at the OAU [Organization of African Unity] this year, and I was just&#13;
astonished at how everybody there was talking about cutting back on military spending. Well,&#13;
what were they saying? They were saying, "It is important the OAU develop a cooperative mode&#13;
so outsiders won't come in and start dictating to us." And so they were all talking about reducing&#13;
military spending, but they wanted to be--and I said this, too. I said, "It is distressing to me that the&#13;
OAU does not accept more responsibility of civil strife because civil strife is destroying&#13;
development in major parts of your continent.â&#128;&#157; And that kind of talk is reassuring to them. They&#13;
would not be reassured if I went in there and said, "You can't spend more than five percent of your&#13;
GNP on military if you're going to borrow from the World Bank." I'll tell you, they wouldn't like&#13;
that.&#13;
&#13;
And that's where I think Bob McNamara makes a mistake. He's trying to define military spending&#13;
in very rigid ways. I think you've got to keep it at a general level and talk about cooperative ways&#13;
of reducing defense, not conditionality.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I noticed in the files something about the Fund and the Bank are collaborating on some&#13;
kind of assessment of this issue? No?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Well, Michel--Michel is very sensitive about loss of function. You know, he doesn't&#13;
have control of exchange rates anymore and so he's testing. Heâ&#128;&#153;s trying to get an environmental&#13;
department over there. You know, what are they going to do with an environmental department in&#13;
the Fund? He's trying to get, to establish himself as a big man on military spending. Well, you&#13;
know, military spending does have a major impact on public expenditure priorities and so that's&#13;
appropriate and I think he has the right to talk about that. But we donâ&#128;&#153;t--he sent a letter to the G-7&#13;
about that, and they interrogated me, "What about you? What do you think?" So I wrote them a&#13;
letter and said I thought it would be a good idea if it would [inaudible] Michel talked about how it&#13;
would be great if the Part IIs didn't buy any arms.&#13;
&#13;
Okay. Letâ&#128;&#153;s see; what's the next one here? "How true is the perception that European interest in&#13;
the Bank is rather lukewarm other than non-issues involving specific national interests of these&#13;
countries [inaudible] Francophone Africa and East Europe?â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
I thinkâ&#128;&#148;I think the U.S. has overplayed its hand in this institution and not played it very&#13;
intelligently with the result that Europe looks at dealing with this institution as providing linkages&#13;
for U.S. pressure. I think that's the biggest problem.&#13;
&#13;
There is an increasingly complicated relationship here coming out of the EBRD [European Bank&#13;
for Reconstruction and Development] where [Jacques] Attali and [Francois M.] Mitterrand take&#13;
positions that one would not expect because they want to control, through the EBRD, French&#13;
interests in Europe, in Eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union.&#13;
&#13;
The staffing issues are tough. We are not getting the recruitment we should from the European&#13;
countries. They're too prosperous.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Salaries aren't that attractive, I guess?&#13;
&#13;
                                       Barber B. Conable&#13;
                               May 8 and August 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   34&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: The U.S. doesn't give a damn about that and makes it apparent. They vote against all&#13;
salary increases, all benefit increases, and they would be perfectly happy to have this Bank staffed&#13;
entirely by Indians on the support staff level and Americans on the senior staff level. And I'm sorry&#13;
to say there is a good deal of U.S. resentment of Part IIs in senior management. I think some of the&#13;
current personnel over at Treasury believe you can't trust a Part II [inaudible] because the&#13;
[inaudible] in order to balance staffing.&#13;
&#13;
I--the Europeans? Of course, they're putting more and more money through the European&#13;
Community. They see that as something they can control without the complications of American&#13;
and Japanese clout. They like that. And we've had a very bad time with Francophone Africa and&#13;
France because Francophone Africa is in terrible shape and the French are very anxious to maintain&#13;
their interests there. At this point Cote d'Ivoire is a symbol of the terrible kind of things that the&#13;
French [inaudible] Iâ&#128;&#153;m unhappy about that. And it's largely their total resistance to any ideas,&#13;
evaluation, the French make. On the other hand, the French, the Europeans generally, have co-&#13;
financed with us magnificently in Africa. We got eight billion dollars in the special program of&#13;
assistance for Africa over the next two years and had only five billion in the last three years. And,&#13;
of course, they insisted and are putting half of IDA money into Africa even though it's got only 450&#13;
million people as opposed to the billion 900 million in India and China.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: This other . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: I think their--the staffing problem is one of the basic difficulties the Europeans have.&#13;
They don't see this Bank as affecting their national interests very much. We have quite a few&#13;
Germans high in management but very few below that. We have no French high in management&#13;
except Yves Rovani. We have very few Italians high in management; a guy who was a country&#13;
director in East Europe had a health problem and had to move onto the shelf. The British have&#13;
some significant presences in management, but the British are kind of linked with the Americans in&#13;
the European mind. And the Japanese play their own games. And I'm talking very frankly again. I&#13;
shouldn't be.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, we appreciate it. The Japanese not moving any more toward . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Towards assertiveness? They'veâ&#128;&#148;theyâ&#128;&#153;re sometimes difficult, but when the chips&#13;
are down they always vote with the Americans. And Mulford and others play all their cards to&#13;
maintain linkages with the Japanese in all sorts of things.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: This overplaying of the hand by the U.S. . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: I don't understand it. It's not in their interest.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Is it something--my sense is that it's been worse in the '80s than it was before.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: It was particularly bad under Don Regan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Barber B. Conable&#13;
                              May 8 and August 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                        35&#13;
&#13;
Jim Baker, I've had no particular problem with. Jim understood this institution and was willing to&#13;
be reasoned with about it. He was tough.&#13;
&#13;
But Brady has had very little interest in this institution. I've almost never called him that he has not&#13;
said, "Barber, I haven't been following that. I'll have to ask Mulford about it." And I've tried to&#13;
call him on a number of occasions. Many of the things that are viewed as accomplishments here&#13;
during my term occurred only because of intervention or fear of intervention by the White House&#13;
with Treasury. That got their attention. I happen to be a good friend of George Bush; George,&#13;
however, did not--I did not dare go to the well too often because Brady's his best friend, and I did&#13;
not want to appear to be undercutting him too much. It would not serve this institution's interests&#13;
were I to do so. But when I really got up against it, I didn't hesitate to go to Brent Scowcroft or&#13;
George, and that usually got Treasury moving.&#13;
&#13;
Of course, we used Congress. Congress is sometimes interested in our problems, too.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: The impression one has is of the Treasury . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Their interest is in maintaining hegemony here. Looking ahead with their&#13;
tremendous shortfall of foreign aid money and the probability that it's going to get even tighter,&#13;
they think it's terribly important that they control this institution. And they're more interested in&#13;
controlling it and in controlling it in a sensible way.&#13;
&#13;
Another thing that Treasury believes that I think is going to--I'm going to have to warn Lew Preston&#13;
about--whenever it is necessary--you see, until the U.S. decides on issues that involve burden-&#13;
sharing, nobody else will because they're the major shareholder here. And they have decided the&#13;
only way to get something from this institution, as long as you've got troops like me running it, is to&#13;
wait until we need something from them and then to make a condition for their contribution&#13;
something that they couldn't get passed by a majority vote in the Board. That explains their desire&#13;
to get something at the time the IFC capital increase was coming up. The trouble is they didn't&#13;
have it clearly in mind what they wanted, and they didn't make a lot of sense when they wanted 50&#13;
percent support for the private sector by 1995. I showed them factually that we were putting more&#13;
than 50 percent in the private sector now through adjustment lending, through the IFC, through&#13;
infrastructure, energy, telecommunications systems, and all those other things that the private&#13;
sector needs--education--and they said, "That's just the way you guys always do! We come up with&#13;
a good idea and you tell us you're already doing it!" Well, we finally settled on some quantitative&#13;
criteria to show that we were making progress in supporting the private sector. But they didn't have&#13;
a clear idea of what they wanted except they knew, "If we don't demand it now, we'll never get it&#13;
because now they need us to come down on their side or they won't get their IFC capital increase."&#13;
&#13;
Now, the same thing happened at the time of IDA IX. They had certain things they wanted, that&#13;
their environmentalists were raising hell about in the United States, and soâ&#128;&#148;and they wanted to&#13;
require country strategy discussions in the Board so frightful Part II types weren't going to be&#13;
deciding what the country strategy was. This would be decided by the Board. And so at that time&#13;
they imposed conditions that couldn't have passed through the Board and eventually got accepted as&#13;
a condition for the contribution to IDA IX. And, as you may recall, we had not the same situation&#13;
but some noise at the time of the doubling of the capital of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
                                       Barber B. Conable&#13;
                               May 8 and August 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   36&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So I don't know what it's all about except I think it has to do with hegemony, with maintaining&#13;
control, maintaining such things as statement of the Bank's capital in dollars--they're really very&#13;
nervous about their legal powers--maintaining the presidency of the Bank and whatever other target&#13;
of opportunity happens to be up at the time of the need for a U.S. contribution to a pattern of&#13;
burden-sharing.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Is this all the Treasury leadership or do you think the Treasury bureaucracy has&#13;
something to do with it?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: I personally believe it starts with Mr. Mulford. I mean, he's a man who has certain&#13;
power goals. I don't think they're personal power goals; they're goals for the institution as an&#13;
American-run institution.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I think the . . .&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side B]&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: . . well, I went and bitched to the President about it. The President looked helpless.&#13;
You know, Baker understands this institution. Baker has not been willing to lift a finger for us&#13;
since he went over there.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Or for anything in the development field, AID or anything.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: But . . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Volcker was much more involved, work out solutions.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Yes, Alan [Greenspan] has not beenâ&#128;&#148;Alanâ&#128;&#153;s an old friend of mine. I was on the&#13;
Social Security Reform Commission with him. But he is not [inaudible] Volcker was much more&#13;
concerned about it.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;In the first half of the '80s, the Reagan Administration took its perceived [inaudible] view on&#13;
population policies, the reason they seem to have put this at the top of the institution [inaudible]&#13;
How do you see these changes occurring in your own thinking as well as in the institution's policies&#13;
are concerned?â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
Well, I think it has a lot to do with the quality of life and with preventing economic growth from&#13;
being overwhelmed by population growth in places like Africa. The institution does not seemâ&#128;&#148;the&#13;
U.S. does not seem to be terribly--the Reagan Administration--opposed to family planning as such,&#13;
provided it isn't the Family Planning Association in the United States, which they think fosters&#13;
abortion. I don't believe it does, but they seem to.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Barber B. Conable&#13;
                              May 8 and August 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                         37&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The U.S. did flip pretty badly, visibly on that at the time of the Mexico conference, when&#13;
[James L.] Buckley went down to lead that delegation. The U.S. had been out in front on&#13;
population . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: They still do a lot of family planning stuff.&#13;
&#13;
Well, I think it's got to have a higher priority here than it's got. There is real resistance to it in the&#13;
staff here.&#13;
&#13;
I was just horrified. Last month I said, "Who's being hired to replace Steve [Steven W.] Sinding?"--&#13;
our population advisor went to [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
And the word came back, "Nobody."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "What is this noise! Get somebody! Get me a nice woman from Sri Lanka or somewhere."&#13;
I don't know; I hope they're doing it because I really think they should have somebody riding herd&#13;
on population.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Steve Sinding has left?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: He left, yeah. He went to the Ford Foundation to get far away from us. And he felt&#13;
he was a voice in the wilderness because he felt resistance from Operations on this issue.&#13;
Operations is frustrated with the population programs because so many of the governments aren't&#13;
willing to own them. You can put all the contraceptive materials you want available to the public&#13;
and, unless the government pushes it, it doesn't happen. And so we've had a lot of population&#13;
programs that just haven't gone anywhere. There are a few splendid exceptions, but a lot of them&#13;
don't.&#13;
&#13;
I think it's a very important part of development. It has a lot to do with quality of life, reduction of&#13;
poverty, and so forth. You know, our studies indicate that by the year 2000, if everything as of the&#13;
â&#128;&#152;90s, as of 1990 continued on, current trends, by the end of the year 2000 there would be 300&#13;
million less people living in absolute poverty, 400 million of them in Asia and a negative 100&#13;
million in Africa. In Africa weâ&#128;&#153;d have 100 more million people living in absolute poverty by the&#13;
year 2000 than now, while in Asia there would be a reduction of about 300 million. Latin America&#13;
would be a stand-off. Now, that's the difference if population [inaudible] Well, at a somewhat&#13;
higher economic growth rate in India up until now, a few years [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
I don't know what changes have occurred in U.S. thinking, except that I think the U.S. still is a&#13;
major supporter of family planning abroad--not in this country. I think the institution's policies can&#13;
be faulted in that we've talked a lot about it and haven't done enough, and I want to see it addressed&#13;
more. I think Preston will be interested in that, too. He and his wife are both active members of&#13;
the Family Planning Association up in New York City.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: These other areas of special emphasis that are associated with you: environment.&#13;
There's been a good deal of pushing from the environmental lobby, hasn't there?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Barber B. Conable&#13;
                                May 8 and August 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     38&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Mm-hmm. But 1--1 don't know. Somehow the Bank got the idea that they mustn't&#13;
become an environmental institution, that they must remain a development institution. I don't see&#13;
that. I think you've got to be an environmental institution if you're going to be an effective&#13;
development institution. And if I've made any contribution at all~ it's in the rather simple things I've&#13;
said about that, that you can't sustain development unless it's environmentally sound, that poverty is&#13;
a toxic force itself, that the poor people are the ones least able to adapt to environmental&#13;
degradation, and that there's a tremendous overlap between, therefore, between environment and&#13;
population which must not be ignored. And as long as you constantly reiterate the fact that you're&#13;
doing this because you want to improve the lot of poor people, you can sell the idea of environment&#13;
in an institution like this which has resisted it. Even though there were a lot of individual&#13;
environmentalists here, institutionally it resisted it. It happened to coincide with a remarkable&#13;
growth in concern about the environment, and the reality that environmental action didn't have any&#13;
possible situs except in the World Bank if you're going to have a global program of some sort. If&#13;
you'd told me five years ago that we were going to be asked to run a global environmental fund in&#13;
1990, I would have been astonished because at that point the Bank was the villain with the black&#13;
moustache as far as environmentalists were concerned. We still are to some degree, but at least&#13;
people understand that unless we do it no body's going to do it effectively.&#13;
&#13;
''Women and development."&#13;
&#13;
Now, I think there's a strong consensus, then, behind environment as a necessary handmaiden of&#13;
development; there's a lot of overlap with development. Women 1n development I'm not so sure&#13;
about. Again, there's a lot of cultural resistance to that, and I am spending a lot of time now--I went&#13;
up and met with the Women's Caucus up on Capitol Hill just the other day to tell them to keep an&#13;
eye on what was happening. It is awfully important that somebody maintain an interest, to keep&#13;
outside pressure on the institution. The thing is to try to ensure that development did not leave off&#13;
half the human race, not for the sake of advancing the role of women but for the sake of reducing&#13;
poverty because poverty is a very substantial women's problem just as illiteracy is a very&#13;
substantial [inaudible] I'm not convinced that that initiative here is necessarily irreversible, and I&#13;
think we've got to work on that some more.&#13;
&#13;
. And, you know, here in the Bank promotion of women is viewed by many of the Part lis as a&#13;
  conspiracy to promote Americans because many of the women working in the Bank are Americans.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: I think that's the other side of the coin of women and development, trying to get more&#13;
women high up in the management. For the first time in history we've had a woman appointed as a&#13;
country director, and now we've got two of them. One is an American; one is a German. We've&#13;
always had a woman somewhere in the management, but she was always the token or maybe she&#13;
was a woman like Anrie Krueger, who was there for ideological reasons.                                     j&#13;
                                                                                                           ct&#13;
LEWIS: Anne handled that pretty well.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                   39&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Kathryn Marshall is one of our own.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Kathryn Marshall's first class; sheâ&#128;&#153;s first rate, very bright, savvy, with-it lady.&#13;
Marianne Haug is very good, too, Ph.D. in economics from MIT. Ball of fire!&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: We're going to talk with her.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: She was my assistant for a while here, very good.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: There is one question that we skipped over, number six. Even though you did . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Six? "Polarization of Part I and Part II?"&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: I'm distressed about that. There is a lot of mistrust. For instance, in the Soviet&#13;
Union, where we could have had our meeting tomorrow, it would have been the Part IIs that would&#13;
have been opposing setting up a special fund for the Soviet Union, and they would have insisted&#13;
that, if we set up a special fund, we broaden it to make it available to others besides the Soviet&#13;
Union. Technical assistance is given to Part II countries but as part of a lending program, for the&#13;
most part. There is no lending program for the Soviet Union. So there was the Soviet Union going&#13;
to get free technical assistance from a fund created out of net income of the Bank, paid by the Part&#13;
IIs. They were very distressed about that, some of them. They felt that if the Soviet Union was&#13;
going to get free technical assistance, the Part IIs should, too. Now the Africans didn't worry about&#13;
that so much as the Middle Easterners and the South Americans and the Indians.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Do you think that--you remember--I donâ&#128;&#153;t know if you were involved in the big North-&#13;
South dialogue back in the '70s . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Not very much.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It was very strident at that time. And one senses that particular wave of rhetoric is&#13;
greatly diminished. The South Commission was a kind of a washout in terms of it didn't get much-&#13;
-Manmohan Singh was the quote [inaudible] He's a first-class man to my mind and heâ&#128;&#153;s doing&#13;
quite a job now, but it didn't really make much of a splash, as far as I can tell. But do you sense&#13;
that within the Bank this confrontation has gotten sharper?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Yeah, I believe so. The China thing was quite distressing for the Part IIs. They all&#13;
felt, "There but for the grace of god go I."&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: I see. And that was pinned on the G-7 reaction to China, particularly the U.S.?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Mm-hmm. You see, the Part IIs feel that--and you remember also when the general&#13;
capital increase went through, the U.S. would not let them get 43.6 percent of the vote which they&#13;
had had before the general capital increase that left them at 42 percent--and they felt they were&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                    40&#13;
&#13;
robbed on that. That's at the same time the G-7 drafted the 2 percent thing. But they also feel&#13;
increasingly, "Look, you've had a billion dollars of profit for each of the past five years. That's&#13;
after you've taken the debt service we've paid you and paid all your administrative expenses,&#13;
after you've set up all your reserves, then you've had a billion dollars of profit, and the U.S. and&#13;
others have always resisted putting any of that profit into IDA." Thereâ&#128;&#153;s been small amounts put&#13;
into IDA from time to time, but now it's just going into surplus. They pay that, and they say, "You&#13;
big countries that contribute only 3 percent of the capital now to the IBRD are doing nothing but&#13;
dictating how our money is going to be used in this institution that's supposed to be for our benefit."&#13;
I hear this a lot.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Increasing?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: You bet. To begin with, they only contribute 3 percent in cash. Remember that.&#13;
The U.S. contributes 70 million dollars, the largest contribution to IBRD annually. What do we&#13;
loan? 16.4 billion this year for 70 million dollars, and who do we loan it to? A very substantial&#13;
degree to South America, which is the U.S. sphere of influence, or in debt reduction for South&#13;
Americaâ&#128;&#148;big sums of money going to debt reduction loans, for instance, helping American banks.&#13;
"With our money!" Part IIs say.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That was the Argentine thing, wasnâ&#128;&#153;t it?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Hmm?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: The claim in the case of Argentina was to bail out the commercial banks.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Sure.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Do you see a split within the Part II countries on this?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Some, because some of them are IDA and some of them aren't. Of course, the IDA&#13;
people don't contribute much to the cost of running this institution.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Well, IDA reflows are going to begin.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: IDA reflows will be up to a billion dollars by 1995.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: That's another contentious issue?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: It's a contentious issue, but I think most people believe that Korea should repay its&#13;
IDA. You see, that's the thing. If you don't take the reflows, then some of the countries that have&#13;
graduatedâ&#128;&#148;I mean, if you don't use the, if you donâ&#128;&#153;t insist on getting the reflows, some of the&#13;
countries that have graduated aren't going to be contributing to the countries that are poor now.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Oh, I think that thereâ&#128;&#153;s noâ&#128;&#148;I wouldn't think there would be much doubt about, should&#13;
take the reflows. The question is what you do with them. But . . .&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
CONABLE: Well, we put them right back into IDA. Well, you see, we set it up so that we could&#13;
even out the reflows and schedule a fairly stable amount during the '90s.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: That's one non-appropriated source.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Mm-hmm. And instead of five billion, we're lending six billion in IDA now. So&#13;
that's good.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Would you care to speculate at all about some of the changes that are coming to the&#13;
Bank?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: I don't know. Itâ&#128;&#153;s very hard to do. There are so many turns in the road that you don't&#13;
expect. The Bank should be a responsive but not necessarily a reactive institution. It's got to&#13;
remain relevant, and that means it's got to be prepared to anticipate changing expectations of it. I&#13;
think it will continue to be a very central part of the development process. I don't really believe&#13;
thereâ&#128;&#153;d be much advantage in a merger between the two institutions. I think pluralism helps. I&#13;
believe in pluralism, and we do have different functions.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: In other words, there's more of a common turf now?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Thereâ&#128;&#153;s more common--well, you see, we're the long-term institution; they're the&#13;
short-term institution. We both reach into the intermediate term, and that's where we had our&#13;
problems, the overlap between the two institutions there. We deliberately decided against trying to&#13;
define the medium term in such a way that there would be mutual exclusivity because we really--as&#13;
full-service institutions we could provide better service to our member countries if we could deal in&#13;
the medium term in comparable areas, providing that you let this [inaudible] over areas of primacy&#13;
[inaudible]. So we deliberately decided to do that. There is more overlap, as you say, but not a&#13;
hell of a lot. They're still a very short-term institution. For instance, they're putting a lot of money&#13;
into East Europe now. We're making a lot of long-term commitments in East Europe. If you look&#13;
at the actual flows, youâ&#128;&#153;d see that the Fund is putting more in than we are right now, but we've&#13;
committed a whale of a lot more than the Fund over a period of time because we're involved in the&#13;
long-term stuff, the sectoral changes that will take a lot of time to accomplish.&#13;
&#13;
Well, I--looking ahead you'll see an increasing number of institutional, of operational initiatives, I&#13;
think. For instance, I think we're going to have to deal with the problem of aging. In large parts of&#13;
the developing world the informal structures that support the elderly are crumbling, mostly family&#13;
and the necessary incidence of subsistence agriculture. You're going to have to get into that as an&#13;
operational initiative. It's expensive, and it's not a long-term investment, but it's part of a&#13;
humanitarian society, and I think it's going to be necessary.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: More into health financing?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Well, I think our development help is going to be, continue to be very largely&#13;
addressed to preventive medicine and the less formal aspects of it. I hope so.&#13;
&#13;
I think you're going to have to push population more than we have.&#13;
&#13;

                               May 8 and August 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    42&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I hope there will be increasing complexity in the development picture. I think you're going to have&#13;
to find where the poor are falling through the holes and block those one by one, and that's what my&#13;
operational initiatives have been designed to do. I think you're going to have to worry about things&#13;
like, youâ&#128;&#153;re continue to worry about things like food security, the various structures that make crisis&#13;
less famine-producing.&#13;
&#13;
I think the environmental thing is going to continue to grow [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I looked at the numbers. The main transfer number [inaudible] to me it is surprisingly&#13;
small.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Oh, yes, thatâ&#128;&#153;s true. It's a reflection of the maturity of our portfolio and the fact that&#13;
we're a long-term institution.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: The Bank seems to get an awful lot of leverage on that amount of money. Do you think&#13;
that will continue?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: I think for one thing there is going to be a lot of pressure on us to reschedule, and I&#13;
worry about that because that will have a big impact on our capacity to borrow money cheaply. If&#13;
we are viewed as appropriately, weâ&#128;&#153;re required to reschedule, our AAA rating is gone. We aren't&#13;
necessarily a preferred creditor, but everybody thinks we are. As long as they think that, we are--a&#13;
lender of last resort.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Is this external pressure [inaudible] institution?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: The Japanese as major co-financiers are increasingly upset that they would be&#13;
required toâ&#128;&#148;in other words, if we ask them to loan with us, they could be required to reschedule&#13;
their debt when we canâ&#128;&#153;t. I can understand that. They think that weâ&#128;&#153;re going to ask them to go in&#13;
with them if we provide the [inaudible] take the risks as well as the gains.&#13;
&#13;
And, of course, we are getting a higher and higher proportion of the portfolio debt in the world.&#13;
Weâ&#128;&#153;re a big institution; weâ&#128;&#153;re lending out for long periods of time; and the bilateral lenders are in&#13;
many cases cutting back. So we have to pick up the slack, and therefore increasingly we're going to&#13;
be viewed as the guy that is forcing the diversion of money into debt service that would go instead&#13;
into feeding the hungry. So I suppose that's going to be an increasing problem.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: The Bank had to reschedule in the '60s and the '70s [inaudible] that there would be&#13;
[inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Not very much. I've heard of that, yes. We don't discuss it.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You don't talk about that much! Do you think this convention is beginning to develop&#13;
some cracks, huh? I mean, itâ&#128;&#153;s aâ&#128;&#148;you donâ&#128;&#153;t, thereâ&#128;&#153;s no question you see . . .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                              May 8 and August 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    43&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: I--this is a natural concomitant of the departure of the commercial banks&#13;
internationally.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Sure. Absolutely.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: We've got to pick up the slack. If we're picking up the slack, we're increasingly the&#13;
creditor. If we're increasingly the creditor, we're increasingly under pressure to behave as other&#13;
creditors do. It would seem perfectly logical, but it also has a lot to do with the perception of our&#13;
being a lender of last resort.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: But if that's so, if you're increasingly a creditor, does it necessarily mean that your credit&#13;
rating is going to suffer if you sometimes reschedule?&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: I don't know. This is a mystic area. Credit ratings are mystic. I don't pretend for a&#13;
minute that I know the answer on that. It seems as though when we have callable capital that we&#13;
should be able to go back on our governments, our capital-providers, if we are suddenly faced with&#13;
a portfolio of growing non-performing debt.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: And if you did that successfully, that ought to be a reinforcement to your credit rating, in&#13;
the sense that you could do it.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Provided you could do it. But I'm told that it's important to have the guarantees on&#13;
both sides of the equation. You want to have--the thing I don't understand is the IFC, which has an&#13;
AAA rating with no government guarantees at all.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: It piggybacks on you, I think.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Well, I think they--there's a lot of confusion about the extent to which they are a part&#13;
of our coattails. And that's an interesting thing: you have this--that's another thing that might&#13;
happen. You might see the IFC become increasingly independent. The U.S. is trying to press them&#13;
into a closer relationship to us. And as a matter of fact, they could have pulled the rug out from&#13;
under them completely if they had required us to change our charter to go to direct lending to&#13;
private sector. The IFC, however, feels it wants to have its own building. It wants to have different&#13;
procurement rules. It wants to have different personnel rules. They resent the complexities of our&#13;
procedures which, of course, are those of a great cross-cultural bureaucracy, while they are small,&#13;
light-footed, dart-in-and-dart-out type of people. So they may become more independent. On the&#13;
other hand, there is a lot of pressure to make them less independent as well. That will be another&#13;
thing that you might want to watch.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Iâ&#128;&#153;ve got a small, sort of minor historical detail. The IFCâ&#128;&#153;s capital increase was made in&#13;
the morning of June 1991. In the morning the U.S. sort of agreed; in the afternoon sort of seems&#13;
that they said no. How did you sort of make a, manage the change there? I mean, it seems you&#13;
were caught by surprise, too.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: I certainly was. We had a deal. They welshed. I called Brent Scowcroft. I told him&#13;
that I was humiliated and embittered by my government's treatment of me and that by god heâ&#128;&#153;d&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                      44&#13;
&#13;
better get it straightened out or I might go public! Excuse me, Iâ&#128;&#153;m--please, you better not get off&#13;
into too much of this! I'll tell you, I've had a tough time with the U.S. I want you to know I felt&#13;
that they have not been my major ally in this institution, let's put it that way. Somebody talked to&#13;
David Mulford, and the following day he agreed to come over and talk with me, and he settled it all&#13;
in five minutes with a claim that he had not known what was happening.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: The closest thing to . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: I get tense when I talk about this!&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: . . the closest thing we have to a villain in this whole scenario is Mulford.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: I don't know whether he's a villain or not. He's a very cock-sure, very intelligent&#13;
man. He can be very nice. I have not had a lot of direct personal difficulty with him. I don't know&#13;
who's doing what to whom over there, but I know that the Secretary is not doing much to anybody.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: But there is a kind of antipathy, isn't there, toward the Bank, thatâ&#128;&#153;s very . . .&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Yes, it is in the sense that I have been too independent, that I am too reliant on Part&#13;
IIs, that the Bank after all should be responsive to U.S. interests because the U.S. is the largest&#13;
shareholder, that we are a big embarrassment to them because we have such high salaries.&#13;
&#13;
Let me tell you an interesting point: I have never yet had a member of Congress talk to me about&#13;
how high our salaries are. The U.S. Treasury tells me they talk about nothing else to them, to the&#13;
U.S. Treasury. I suspect itâ&#128;&#153;s the U.S. Treasury talking to the U.S. Congress, not the other way&#13;
around. And when I talk to Congressmen, I sometimes bring it up myself and say, "We have a&#13;
problem of recruitment, of getting people to dislocate and come here." And, well, I don't want to&#13;
get off onto this. Little things like the TAMRA [U.S. Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of&#13;
1988] change in the inheritance tax law--it absolutely devastated our staff here. And what does&#13;
Treasury want to do? They want to bargain with me about it. They didn't even know it happened&#13;
when it happened. You know something about that, don't you?&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: A little, yes.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: They startedâ&#128;&#148;they decided they would tax for inheritance tax purposes all foreigners&#13;
residing in this country, even on G-4 visas, so that if--let's say a fellow who has worked here fifteen&#13;
years and has his wife here on a G-4 visa dies, he doesn't get the marital deduction--his estate&#13;
doesn't get the marital deduction under TAMRA. And the widow, who has an actuarial expectancy&#13;
of 50% of his pension for the rest of her life, has to borrow the money to pay the actuarial value of&#13;
that pension before she leaves 60 days later. She has to get out of the country in 60 days. She will&#13;
have a million dollar pension expectancy. If she dies the following day, she still owes the full&#13;
million dollars; it's still subject to inheritance tax here.&#13;
&#13;
Now, this is a crummy thing. It's a total violation of the spirit of the Bretton Woods institutions.&#13;
Treasury says, "We'll negotiate about it." I've taken it up to Pat [Daniel Patrick] Moynihan and&#13;
Sam Gibbons, two of my good Democratic friends, a bill to replace, to put this back the way it was.&#13;
&#13;
                                      Barber B. Conable&#13;
                              May 8 and August 19, 1991 - Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                        45&#13;
&#13;
Treasury doesn't even know it. But they want to tell us, "No, we'll give you a little bit back." And&#13;
they didn't even know it happened when it happened because the purpose was to catch foreigners&#13;
living under work permits in this country and staying here for years, who were not here on G-4&#13;
visas solely because they were working for a multi-national institution allegedly protected by the&#13;
Bretton Woods Treaty or who were protected by the special treaty setting up the U.N.&#13;
&#13;
This is the sort of thing that really destroys our capacity to recruit. You tell some young fellow, "If&#13;
something happens to you here, you're caught with the value of your house without a marital&#13;
deduction, you're caught with any savings you've got in this country, and you're caught with the&#13;
actuarial value of your widow's pension. You've got to do it all, get it all paid off 60 days before&#13;
you leave." I tell you, you know, the inheritance tax starts at 37 percent. Usually, you get the&#13;
600,000 dollar marital deduction--if you're an American. Not if you're a foreigner! Excuse me. I&#13;
didn't mean to get off on this.&#13;
&#13;
There are a lot of technical things like this. You know, Treasury won't help us! And then they say,&#13;
"No increase in pay for you guys. You're paid too much now." They vote against us every time a&#13;
pay increase comes up. And you know why it comes up? Because of the Dallara formula! We got&#13;
a big pay increase--excuse me. I get it going here. Excuse me.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Iâ&#128;&#153;d heard about that one.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Yes, well, he held it up for four years over here in joint committee until he got&#13;
exactly what he wanted, and ever since then the U.S. has voted against it because it resulted in too&#13;
high a pay increase. I'm sorry; I'm sorry. I get going. You understand.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: We do.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: This has something to do with why a fellow leaves because I get so exasperated&#13;
sometimes. I don't understand it. This is my government! I was in it for twenty years! They're all&#13;
my friends! And they act as if they hate this institution!&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: You've got a copy of this.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
Look, friends, I talked very directly to you, and I say things I shouldn't say from the point of view&#13;
of the institution. I don't give a damn about me because I'm going and I'm not likely to come back.&#13;
But you've got to be somewhat careful in how you . . .&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: We're going to try to use judgment.&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: Yes, I wish you would because it is not in the interest of the institution to have&#13;
somebody appear to have a virulent anti-U.S. animus in the management. The U.S. has got to&#13;
consider its relationship to this institution because it is a terribly important institution, greatly&#13;
advancing American interests.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: Right. It has to be a theme of this work we're doing, that the U.S. role is clearly central.&#13;
It's been terribly important, much has been positive and it's been pretty ...&#13;
&#13;
CONABLE: And usually the U.S. has been right on the substantive issues they have taken.&#13;
They're right about the private sector as an important modality. They've been right about the&#13;
environment, although I must say they aren't concerned about the environment qua environment.&#13;
They're concerned about environmentalists pressing on their Congress, and that's an interesting&#13;
thing. I have a tendency to believe that the empowerment that must take place sh~uld be&#13;
accountable to the people of the countries we are dealing with and not necessarily to a great&#13;
international network of sometimes distressingly single-minded donors to environmental causes&#13;
where their consciences are involved because they are spewing out petrochemicals or using 30&#13;
percent of the energy in the world when they have only 3 percent of the population. I think our&#13;
accountability should instead be to the NGOs in India who happen to be every bit as outraged about&#13;
the Sardar Sarovar dam as somebody from London is orÂ·somebody in New York City.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: You've got the first ever independent review of the Bank funded {inaudible} What sort&#13;
of-it's the first, I guess [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;

Morse]                                                          We're having an interesting time&#13;
on that. We'll get it straightened out. He's coming in tomorrow, as a matter of fact.&#13;
&#13;
That, however, is something that I think is entirely reasonable, having--if there is a good bit of&#13;
dispute about a project of that sort, let's find out what the facts are because there's an awful lot, you&#13;
know--that project, for instance, will benefit a million five hundred thousand people through&#13;
electricity, through drinking water, and through irrigation. It will affect 40,000 to 60,000 tribal&#13;
peoples sometime after 1995. As far as I know, most of the tribal peoples have already been&#13;
guaranteed land elsewhere, but they still are the focal po.int of the Survival Limited group in&#13;
London and some of the other environmental groups who think that this outrage has got to be&#13;
stopped.&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank is providing a very modest portion of the fmancing for this, but we are being held&#13;
accountable. For some time, two years ago, I got over a thousand letters a day from Britain alone&#13;
about the Sardar Sarovar dam. Well, it's time we tried to cut some of the legend out of this and find&#13;
out what the facts actually are. And I sold the Indian government on that approach, and I'm not in a&#13;
position to make major concessions to international environmental groups so that they can have&#13;
their hour on the stage denouncing us. The idea was not to make a political exercise out of it to try&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
to remove the objections but to find out what the facts are and publicize those instead. I hope we&#13;
can get it straightened out. We're going to try.&#13;
&#13;
This is an interesting exercise, though, because it is quite new, as you say to go into that. I&#13;
originally offered them a budget of 250,000 dollars. The Canadian consultants have just submitted&#13;
a proposed budget of 1.3 million. I have agreed to compromise with Mr. Morse to go up to&#13;
500,000, but I'm not willing to go beyond that.&#13;
&#13;
It's an interesting exercise, as I said.&#13;
&#13;
LEWIS: This has been a fascinating interview. Thank you very much.&#13;

CONABLE: Well, all right. It's good to see you. I hope things . . .&#13;

        <abstracts>
            On May 8 and August 19, 1991, Barber
            Conable was interviewed by the Brookings Institution on
            behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral history program
            by John Lewis, Richard Webb, and Devesh Kapur. During his
            tenure at the Bank from 1986 to 1991, Mr. Conable served as
            the seventh president of the World Bank Group. He is known
            for advocating for the Bank's responsibility to address
            environmental and social problems, promoting programs to
            curtail population growth, and advancing the role of women
            in development. His transcript discusses the Bank's
            reorganization upon his appointment, a process that
            ultimately cut four hundred redundant positions within the
            organization. While the reorganization was being
            implemented, Conable sought funding for the Bank from the
            U.S. administration, obtaining solid support from the U.S.
            Congress. Negotiations for the IDA-8 replenishment were
            accomplished smoothly. During his presidency, Mr. Conable
            also fought to relieve the ongoing developing world debt
            crisis with a particular emphasis on funding programs in
            Africa. The Bank also increased its activities to support
            the private sector during Conable's tenure. The
            Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) was launched
            in 1988 to insure private investors against political risks
            and thereby promote private investments in developing countries.
