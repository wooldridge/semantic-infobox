Description of Activities, Expenditures and Governance Arrangements under the MAF Multi-&#13;
Donor Trust Fund for Yemen&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all agreements entered into&#13;
between the Bank and entities (collectively, the "Donors") that provide contributions (the aggregate&#13;
of all contributions from the Donors, the "Contributions") to be administered by the Bank for the&#13;
Trust Fund.&#13;
A. DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIES&#13;
The overarching objective of the YMAFTF is to strengthen the capacity of the government&#13;
to coordinate and monitor commitments made under the six pillars of the MAF and by donors at the&#13;
Riyadh and New York Meetings.&#13;
(i)   Bank-Executed Trust Fund Activities:&#13;
(a) provision of advisory support to the MAF Coordination Secretariat in order to&#13;
build and strengthen its capacities and competencies; (b) program management and Trust&#13;
Fund administration; and (c) supervision of Recipient Executed activities.&#13;
(ii)  Recipient-Executed Trust Fund Activities:&#13;
(a) setting up MAF Coordination Secretariat, equipped with high level professional&#13;
and administrative staff; (b) provision of office equipment and furniture for the MAF&#13;
Secretariat; (c) organizing and conducting consultation workshops and study visits on key&#13;
policy issues; and (d) provision of on-demand technical assistance on various areas of the&#13;
MAF.&#13;
B. CATEGORIES OF EXPENDITURE&#13;
For Bank-Executed activities, the Contributions may be used to finance: (a) associated&#13;
overheads; (b) consultant fees individuals and firms; (c) contractual services; (d) extended term&#13;
consultants; (e) media, workshops, conferences and meetings; (f) staff costs - with indirect&#13;
costs; (g) temporary support staff costs; and (h) travel expenses.&#13;

The foregoing categories of expenditures may include the financing of taxes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿C. GOVERNANCE ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
The World Bank will be solely responsible and accountable for the administration of MAF&#13;
Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Yemen, as well as the supervision of recipient-executed tasks&#13;
financed under YMAFTF, within the context of its operational policies and guidelines, and as&#13;
stipulated in the respective Administration and Grant Agreements. A World Bank Task Team&#13;
Leader (TTL) will oversee implementation of this Trust Fund. In addition, a field-based&#13;
YMAFTF coordinator will be selected to oversee the broader program requirements, and&#13;
coordinate and facilitate day-to-day operations of YMAFTF. The YMAFTF coordinator will&#13;
work in close coordination with the TTL as well as the World Bank Country Manager located in&#13;

activities and Recipient-executed activities) will apply. As part of the MAF agreement, there&#13;

commitment made. These meetings will be co-chaired by the Government of Yemen (GoY) and&#13;
the WB, and will provide status update on the progress (Annex- Results Framework) and give&#13;
opportunity to the representatives of the MG to provide suggestions on adjustments in direction&#13;

place every six months to take forward the discussion on MAF implementation.&#13;

and priorities identified by the Bank in consultation with Government and which meet the&#13;
overall objective of implementing and operationalizing the Mutual Accountability Framework&#13;
(MAF).&#13;
