PRIORITIES IN EDUCATION: PRE-SCHOOL; EVIDENCE AND CONCLUSIONS&#13;
This paper presents and evaluates the broad results of pre-school&#13;
intervention experiments and programs aimed at fostering the intellectual&#13;
and social development of "disadvantaged" groups. It is an outgrowth of&#13;
the World Bank's interest in identifying priorities for educational inter-&#13;
ventions. Among the general findings discussed are that there is a "sensi-&#13;
tive," or even "critical," period in child development, an age at which&#13;
a child will be more susceptible to fostering; that a dominant share of&#13;
intelligence develops during early childhood; that a gap in IQ between&#13;
"advantaged" and "disadvantaged" groups exists before school entrance&#13;
and widens thereafter; that "traditional" kindergartens do not protect&#13;
disadvantaged children from lagging behind or failine in school; and that&#13;
malnutrition or poor health have a marked effect on intellectual development.&#13;
While studies have shown that IQ may be accelerated through pre-school pro-&#13;
grams, preschool is not the "cure-all" it was anticipated to be. Generally,&#13;
children with initially lower IQs show the largest gains. But, in most&#13;
studies, it was found that within a few years the children who were not in&#13;
the special programs made up the difference with the "fostered" group.&#13;
Very sophisticated and expensive programs have produced longer-term results,&#13;
but such programs are not feasible in most cases. The results of studies&#13;
where parents were involved in early childhood development have been promising.&#13;
Some such studies have shown that with a shorter-term intervention, the IQ&#13;
gains have been maintained for a longer time than with pre-school programs.&#13;
On the basis of the evidence available the author concludes that priority&#13;
to pre-school intervention can not be justified. Rather, priority should&#13;
be given to educational support to the family unit. T'h most effective age&#13;
group for such support are adolecents.&#13;

PREFACE&#13;
This paper and an accompanying paper by Roger Grawe have been&#13;
produced as part of ongoing work in Population and Human Resources Division&#13;
of the Development Economics Department, and the Education Department to&#13;
evaluate relative educational investment priorities in different age groups.&#13;
In view of the increased priority attached to pre-school intervention in&#13;
recent years, an informal working group within the World Bank was formed&#13;
to consider whether the pre-school period deserved greater emphasis in&#13;
its activities in education, nutrition, and health. Foremost among the&#13;
questions to be considered was the relationship between the timing of the&#13;
intervention on investment and subsequent productivity. Though little&#13;
direct longitudinal evidence could be brought to bear, the hypothesis that&#13;
investments during pre-school years generated outcomes in skills and abilities&#13;
which themselves subsequently enhanced productivity was considered worthy&#13;
of investigation. As the Bank is increasingly involved in assisting less-&#13;
developed countries restructure their educational priorities, an important&#13;
question was, simply, should more priority be given to the education of&#13;
disadvantaged pre-school children in an effort to generate a more equitable&#13;
distribution of outcomes.&#13;
To review the evidence on pre-school intervention the Bank&#13;
invited Professor Moshe Smilansky of Tel Aviv University to participate&#13;
in a staff seminar in November 1975. Smilansky contended that the results&#13;
of pre-school intervention experiments and programs, at least as measured&#13;
by cognitive tests, were inconclusive at best and did not establish a case&#13;
for investments priority to the pre-school age category. However, Smilansky&#13;
noted that the more successful experiments had been those involving the&#13;
participation of parents. Extrapolating from his experience as an educa-&#13;
i&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
tional policy-maker in Israel, Smilansky proposed, in a preliminary fashion&#13;
in an annex to this paper, that the need, particularly in modernizing&#13;
societies, is for greater support to the family unit. The most effective&#13;
target age for such support, he argued, was adolescence.&#13;
The paper by Roger Grawe reviews the role of childhood ability as&#13;
a determinant of subsequent earnings. Grawe then develops some new&#13;
empirical evidence on the effects of various family characteristics in&#13;
fostering abilities in pre-school children. This research reinforces,&#13;
through a quite different methodological route, Smilansky's conclusion that&#13;
pre-school outcomes can best be enhanced oy support to the existing family&#13;
structure; in particular, Grawe identifies the status of the mother and&#13;
income as consistent predictors of ability for children from disadvantaged&#13;
backgrounds.&#13;
A significant limitation to the research reviewed and reported by&#13;
Smilansky and Grawe is its reliance on experience and data from developed&#13;
economies. This is tempered somewhat by the focus on disadvantaged groups&#13;
within these economies but generalizations still cannot be accepted. The&#13;
papers serve to indicate that too little is yet known concerning the&#13;
development of intelligence, and its relevance as conventionally measured,&#13;
to formulate new educational priorities in developing countries. But the&#13;
weight of the evidence is now that intervention through support of the existing&#13;
family structure offers the best chance of augmenting the abilities of&#13;
disadvantaged pre-school children and increasing the likelihood of greater&#13;
subsequent achievement.&#13;
The author would like to express his appreciation to Dov Cherni-&#13;
chovsky and Mats Hultin for initiating this paper and for their detailed&#13;
comments; Martha Grosse, Susan Cochrane, Timothy King, and John Simmons&#13;
also contributed valuable comments. Of course, none of these individuals&#13;
are responsible for remaining deficiencies.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I. WHY PRIORITY TO PRESCHOOL?&#13;
To present in meaningful way the available evidence on the impact&#13;
of preschool intervention in fostering disadvantaged children, we must first&#13;
understand the reasons why priority was given to preschool research and devel-&#13;
opment. Furthermore, to evaluate the mass of evidence that has accumulated,&#13;
the limitations of that evidence must also be considered.&#13;
The wave of preschool research and development originated in the&#13;
early 60's. It was initiated with great faith and abundant funding (mainly&#13;
in the U.S.), and many creative and committed psychologists and educators&#13;
participated in this scientifically unexplored field. The commitment to pre-&#13;
school developed from a variety of sources. Psychologists used theoretical&#13;
or empirical evidence about the impact of early experiences on later behavior.&#13;
They utilized assumptions from theories of learning, theories of thinking,&#13;
and theories of management to construct programs for intervention and foster-&#13;
ing. Mlany of these adaptations may now seem naive, but the social pressure&#13;
at that time was to create crash programs and extend them on a large scale;&#13;
longitudinal evidence to evaluate such programs was not available. Educators&#13;
who had worked mostly in preschools developed for middle-class children&#13;
assumed that with some adaptation, they could use the same assumptions and&#13;
practices to benefit disadvantaged populations also. Politicians and admini-&#13;
strators -- who were under public presure to produce immediate and large-scale&#13;
change toward equality of opportunity, democratization of the school system,&#13;
and social integration -- jumped on the "bandwagon" of promising preliminary&#13;
results from preschool experiments and made large-scale commitments.&#13;
II. LIMITATIONS OF THE EVIDENCE&#13;
Evidence from the preschool programs developed under such pressures&#13;
must, of course, be interpreted cautiously. To evaluate these results, we&#13;
must identify and discuss the limitations of the evidence. One must be par-&#13;
ticularly cautious in interpreting this evidence for use in decision-making.&#13;
Our statements are constrained by such phrases as "assume," "propose," and&#13;
"seem to be," but in some cases, even such phrases do not express the need&#13;
for understatement. Also, we should remind the reader that correlations do&#13;
not prove cause and effect relationship, and statistical significance does&#13;
not assume educational significance to persons and society. The most impor-&#13;
tant limitations are discussed below.&#13;
(a) The research designs and measurement tools are relatively primitive,&#13;
when they are used to measure the very complex and dynamic configu-&#13;
rations involved in the educational fostering of disadvantaged&#13;
children.&#13;
(b)  Because there has been almost no large-scale planning, the research&#13;
projects in human development that have been conducted are nearly&#13;
impossible to compare. In most cases the samples are different,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
different tests were used for similar samples, and information&#13;
about the initial fostering programs and the follow-through experi-&#13;
ence is insufficient. Actually the only standardized test that wits&#13;
used in large enough samples for longitudinal evaluation was the&#13;
Stanford-Binet. So with all its known limitations, there was no&#13;
choice but to depend on its results.&#13;
(c) From hundreds of available experiments in compensatory education&#13;
in the U.S., only a few were appropriate for comparison and gen-&#13;
eralization. The criteria for choice included: (1) relatively&#13;
well-designed experimental and control groups, (2) pre- and post-&#13;
test evaluations, (3) replications with other comparable age groups,&#13;
and (4) data on long-range impact. To illustrate this problem,&#13;
in three large-scale systematic screening attempts by Wargo (1971),&#13;
Stearns (1971), and E. Gordon (1971), which were commissioned and&#13;
financed by U.S. federal agencies, the researchers canvassed hun-&#13;
dreds of studies and found only a few that seemed to meet the pre-&#13;
scribed criteria -- and even then, reservations were raised by&#13;
those concerned.&#13;
(d) In the more relevant evaluations of interventions, which are well-&#13;
designed longitudinal studies with appropriate experimental and&#13;
control groups, only small numbers of cases were available in each&#13;
group. Thus, the necessary differentiations of variables for in-&#13;
depth understanding of the elements contributing to the effective-&#13;
ness of fostering are in most cases unavailable.&#13;
(e) We focused on measures of cognitive development in most generaliza-&#13;
tions and interpretations of available results. There were five&#13;
reasons for this choice0 First, cognitive capacity is the dominant&#13;
recorded deficiency of the disadvantaged groups relative to norma-&#13;
tive groups0 Second, society at an advanced stage of scientific&#13;
and technological modernization demands increased cognitive capabil-&#13;
ities, and those unable to upgrade their level of performance wiLl&#13;
be considered culturally disadvantaged0 Third, the correlations&#13;
between cognitive measurements and school achievement suggest an&#13;
impact of low IQ on school failure0 Fourth, continued experience&#13;
of failure in one of the dominant institutions -- school -- contri-&#13;
butes to deterioration in the affective domain -- mental health,&#13;
self-esteem, achievement-motivation, social relations, etc.&#13;
Finally, although everyone recognizes the importance of the non-&#13;
cognitive domain, the tools available to evaluate this area are&#13;
questionable -- in techniques of measurement, available results,&#13;
and suggested interpretations. Their use in most studies has been&#13;
either sparse or questionable; and even where interesting data are&#13;
available, there are many unanswerable questions as to their inter-&#13;
pretation for use by decision-makers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-   - 3-&#13;
(f) The best available longitudinal evaluative studies followed&#13;
their subjects only through the early school grades (fourth&#13;
grade, at the latest). Some psychologists (Herzog, 1974;&#13;
Palmer, 1976) suggest that this is a limited perspective of&#13;
the preschool intervention efforts. We also suggest that an&#13;
attempt should be made to find evidence at adolescence and&#13;
adulthood that a specific group of children received any&#13;
benefit from systematic intellectual fostering during early&#13;
childhood. This is not to contradict the fact that positive&#13;
experience of young children during elementary education is&#13;
also a positive contribution.    ,me of the eavly 1&#13;
program developers (Deutsch, 1974; Gray, 1974) claim that if&#13;
the impact of their intervention was registered significantly&#13;
even two years after termination of the program, it should be&#13;
considered very powerful and beneficial. We present both&#13;
suggestions because each may be valid in decision-making.&#13;
(g) Because of financial restrictions, we limited our consideration&#13;
to American and Israeli experiments. But available evidence from&#13;
other developed countries does not seem to produce better results.&#13;
(h) The results of adapting or replicating the available approaches&#13;
in developing countries -- which are the focus of interest for&#13;
the World Bank -- are unknown. Only an international experiment&#13;
that supports developing countries to 'esIgn, prAcess, and eAvalate&#13;
their fostering attempts will provide the necessary complementary&#13;
contribution to the presently available propositions.&#13;
(i) An estimate of the cost effectiveness of specific approaches, with-&#13;
out which a policy-oriented evaluation is incomplete, is beyond the&#13;
scope of this assignment.&#13;
Despite these limitations (and more could be added), the generaliza-&#13;
tions to be made are not invalid. As will be discussed, a systematic trend in&#13;
most data justifies some basic generalizations. And while there is a need for&#13;
improving evaluation processes, suggestions for policy orientation must be&#13;
given careful consideration by those concerned.&#13;
III. IN SUPPORT OF PRESCHOOL PRIORITY&#13;
The large-scale, and very diversified, attempts at intellectual&#13;
and social fostering of the disadvantaged produced hundreds of projects&#13;
that could be used as illustrations. But, to minimize the length of this&#13;
memorandum, we selected evidence that was: conceptually stronger and pre-&#13;
sented by a recognized scientist in this field, empirically stronger because&#13;
it was supported by pre- and post-test data and was based on experimental&#13;
and control groups, and (where possible) comparatively stronger because it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
was based on culturally different groups and at the same time provided similar&#13;
intervention processes. For specific illustrations, data that would not&#13;
qualify under these restrictions, but that are relevant in explaining a&#13;
specific point, will be presented. Other studies that meet the criteria and&#13;
made significant contributions, but are not crucial to decisions about the&#13;
topic of priorities, had to be omitted in the interest of saving space.&#13;
The evidence most often cited to support preschool programs falls&#13;
into six broad areas:&#13;
(a) Evidence of elasLicicy, or even a critical period, during cognitive&#13;
development.&#13;
McVicker Hunt, in Intelligence and Experience (1961), accumulated&#13;
a large body of conceptual and empirical evidence supporting the assumption&#13;
that the preschool years are more open for long-term impact in the cognitive&#13;
domain, in contrast to earlier propositions by the Freudian school about the&#13;
life impact of early experiences on mental health manifestations. Gans (1968)&#13;
went further and said that visual deprivation not only prevents the develop-&#13;
ment of the critical cells but causes a definite regression. The innate mech-&#13;
anisms are incomplete and must be further developed by appropriate experience&#13;
during a "critical" period.&#13;
The origin of the concept of "critical period" can be traced to&#13;
data from studies in animal research of "imprinting" by Lorenz (1970-1), Hess&#13;
(1964), and others. Although no direct and longitudinal evidence of imprint-&#13;
ing was available, Darwinian assumptions prompted the theoretical extension&#13;
from mammals to humans. These extensions were also supported by two clusters&#13;
of evidence. One was research on mother-child separation and the effect of&#13;
deprived institutional experience on later development, which dominated the&#13;
40's and early 50's (Spitz, 1945; Goldfarb, 1945; Bowlby, 1952; Dennis, 1941;&#13;
etc.). The other type of evidence came from transformational linguists who&#13;
held as a basic assumption that man has an inborn, species-specific, acutely&#13;
sensitive, and intelligently responsible facility for language development&#13;
during a critical period early in his development (McNeill, 1966; Fodor,&#13;
1966; Chomsky, 1966),&#13;
(b) Evidence that the dominant share of intelligence develops in early&#13;
childhood.&#13;
Bloom in Stability and Change in Human Characteristics (1964)&#13;
summarized the evidence from most of the available longitudinal studies&#13;
of human growth in the U.S. He plotted comparable developmental curves&#13;
and concluded that (pp. 88-89):&#13;
Many longitudinal studies have been done with measures&#13;
of general intelligence and scholastic aptitude ...The&#13;
studies revealed increased stability with increased age.&#13;
When a number of longitudinal studies are compared with&#13;
each other, and allowances are made for the reliability&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
of the instruments and the variability of samples, a&#13;
single pattern clearly emerges...   Both the correla-&#13;
tional data and the absolute scale of intelligence&#13;
development make it clear that intelligence is a de-&#13;
veloping function and that the stability of measured&#13;
intelligence increases with age. Both types of data&#13;
suggest that in terms of intelligence measured at age&#13;
17, about 50 percent of the development takes place&#13;
between conception and age 4, about 30 percent between&#13;
ages 4 and 8 and about 20 percent between ages 8 and&#13;
i7...  These resuits... reveal the changing rate at&#13;
which intelligence developed, since as much of the de-&#13;
velopment takes place in the first four years of life&#13;
as in the next 13 years.&#13;
(c)  Evidence of high correlations between home environment and child's IQ,&#13;
school achievement, and teacher rating.&#13;
Data has been accumulating on this since early post World War II&#13;
in studies in different countries, which used longitudinal local and national&#13;
samples. In the early 60's more sophisticated approaches, for example, by&#13;
Bloom (1964) and his students Wolf (1964) and Dave (1964) on home process&#13;
variables, contributed to propositions about hypothetical potentialities for&#13;
more directive home interventions. Also elaborate observations in the homes&#13;
of disadvantaged samples by anthropologists, sociologists, and psychologists&#13;
served directly as evidence of the need for home-oriented or institutional&#13;
intervention in child-rearing.&#13;
(d) Evidence of a "cumulative deficit."&#13;
Studies in the U.S., various European countries, and Israel showed&#13;
that a gap between certain ethnic, socio-economic, or geographic groups was&#13;
evident before school entrance.&#13;
Bayley (1965), Francis-Williams and Yule (1967), and Schaefer&#13;
(1969) -- in the U.S. - did not find significant differences in IQ measure-&#13;
ment with the Bayley Infant Mental Test, according to socio-economic back-&#13;
ground, up to 15 months. Hindley (1965) in England and Smilansky, S. and&#13;
Shefatiah (1975) in Israel, both using the Brunnete-Lezine infant mental&#13;
test, found no significant differences at 18 months. But both Hindley and&#13;
Smilansky, S. and Shefatiah found very significant differences at 3 years.&#13;
This difference in IQ according to socio-economic background was evident also&#13;
in the original normative data of Terman (1937) and in the normative data of&#13;
the Israeli adaption of WPPSI by Lieblich, Ninio, and Kugelmas, where the gap&#13;
was evident at age 4. This gap increased during elementary education and&#13;
reached widest proportions during adolescence (In Israel: Ortar, G., 1956;&#13;
Smilansky, M. and Yam, 1969; in England: Floud and Hallsey; in France:&#13;
Girard; and in the United States:   Deutsch, Goldberg, Coleman, Osborne, etc.).&#13;
From such evidence (along with the "dominant share" and "critical period"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
propositions mentioned previously) it was believed that an effective program&#13;
during early childhood could "innoculate" children against the "cumulati.ve&#13;
deficit" disease.&#13;
(e) Evidence about the inability of traditional kindergarten to prepare&#13;
disadvantaged children for the expectations of schooling.&#13;
Through specific evaluations of kindergarten and primary grade&#13;
"iproducts" (Smilansky, S., 1958) -- and from a general realization that&#13;
although kindergartens for 5-year=olds were available in the U.S., England,&#13;
France, Israel, and other countries, failure and retardation in primary&#13;
grades occurred on a large scale for disadvantaged children (Wall, 1956:;&#13;
Smilansky, M., 1957) -- propositions for an earlier Head Start program mnd&#13;
specially designed cognitively oriented programs adapted to needs of the&#13;
disadvantaged have emerged in different countries.&#13;
(f) Evidence of the impact of malnutrition and other health conditions&#13;
on cognitive development.&#13;
Evidence has come from the early studies of Pasamanick and Knobloch&#13;
(1958), Kawi (1959), and Kawi and Pasamanick (1959) on the relationship&#13;
between prenatal and perinatal complications and reading problems. The Birch&#13;
study (1970) demonstrated the impact of child health in the Garibbean a.rea,&#13;
the Werner and Muralidharan study (1970) commented that malnutrition has a&#13;
marked effect on intellectual as well as other development (e.g., head cir-&#13;
cumference and visual-motor development), and an expert group of the American&#13;
Academy of Sciences (1973) made a formal statement on "The Relationship of&#13;
Nutrition to Brain Development and Behavior." These types of evidence were&#13;
the impetus for including health diagnosis and feeding programs in Head Start&#13;
and similar programs0 Many justify the continuation of such preschool pro-&#13;
grams on the basis of this evidence even when the programs do not demonstrate&#13;
long-range cognitive improvement0&#13;
IV. EVALUATIONS OF PROGRAiS IN PRESCHOOL AND INFANCY&#13;
Despite the restrictions and limitations of the research during the&#13;
past decade, some generalizations are possible0 We shall first list each&#13;
generalization and present some supporting evidence, then try to suggest an&#13;
interpretation of the evidence to those interested in setting priorities for&#13;
policies0&#13;
(a) There is evidence that IQ may be changed in preschool years.&#13;
In several projects, mainly small-scale and highly motivated re-&#13;
search experiments, significant changes in IQ of disadvantaged populations&#13;
were demonstrated0 Such changes were evident both in institutional and&#13;
home-based programs of intervention, as will be detailed later0 The more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
successful intervention desi2ns -- both in infancy and preschool age groups --&#13;
produced a mean difference of 14 to 20 points between experimental and control&#13;
groups during a one-year program. Differences of such magnitude were demon-&#13;
strated not only between an experimental "fostering" group and a "no treatment"&#13;
control group (Sprigle, 1974; Palmer, 1968; Weikart, et al., 1970; Karnes, et&#13;
al., 1969; Gray and Klaus, 1970; Heber, et al., 1972) but also between a&#13;
cognitively oriented directive approach and a "traditional" kindergarten or&#13;
preschool approach (Smilansky, S., 1964; Hodges, Spicker, McCandles, 1967;&#13;
Karnes, 1969; Bereiter and Engleman, 1966).&#13;
If only the initially lower IQ children (those with initial IQ of&#13;
80-90 on Stanford-Binet) in the above-mentioned studies are compared, we&#13;
see even greater increases in IQ in the experimental groups after an inter-&#13;
vention of one or two years (Smilansky, S., 1964; Karnes, Bereiter, and&#13;
Engelman, 1969; Weikart, 1970). A year of fostering by S. Smilansky (1964)&#13;
in Jerusalem produced an upward mean difference of 20 points, during a year&#13;
of kindergarten, and a more powerful intervention by Heber, et al. (1972) in&#13;
Milwaukee produced a difference of 26 points at the age of three in a program&#13;
initiated at infancy.&#13;
In the less successful experimental programs, mean differences were&#13;
about 10 points. Regular field-based interventions, like Head Start, gen-&#13;
erally produced changes of less than 10 points. Stearns (1971) stated that&#13;
(p. 13):&#13;
Most of the children in these samples (of Head Start&#13;
studies) ranged in IQ on the Stanford-Binet Intelli-&#13;
gence Scale from the low 80's to the low 90's. The&#13;
changes in IQ (or difference in post-test scores be-&#13;
tween groups) were usually less than 10 points and&#13;
were most often smaller than half of the standard&#13;
deviation from the mean... Even when there were re-&#13;
liable statistically significant changes, they were&#13;
quite modest. The superiority of the Head Start&#13;
children resulted from their knowing only a few more&#13;
items in comparison with the non-Head Start group.&#13;
The practical significance of such gains is difficult&#13;
to determine.&#13;
As one illustration, Stearns presents evidence from Beller (1968) with a&#13;
group of disadvantaged 4-year-old black children in a year-long program in&#13;
Philadelphia. These "children's mean scores on the Stanford-Binet were&#13;
about 90 before and 95 after the preschool experience, while the control&#13;
groups did not change." Stearns summarized (p. 16): "prekindergarten and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
kindergarten classes conducted as part of school systems' compensatory ecluca-&#13;
tion programs seem to have produced about the same order of measured changes&#13;
in general intellectual ability as Head Start."&#13;
There are also examples of highly sophisticated experimental pro-&#13;
grams, with a very high ratio of per pupil investment in professional man-&#13;
power and equipment, that produced less than 10 points of IQ improvement;:&#13;
we shall discuss later the possible explanations for both the significant:&#13;
immediate acceleration and the minimal changes.&#13;
TIare we may summarize by saying that experimental, small-scale.,&#13;
powerful interventions, which were adapted to certain disadvantaged popu--&#13;
lations' potentiality for change, producod immediate acceleration in IQ ---&#13;
ranging about 15-20 points. In large-scale public systems (like Head Start&#13;
or traditional preschools, either in the U.S. or Israel), the range of&#13;
change was only 5-10 IQ points0&#13;
(b) Generally, children who originally score lower in IQ demonstrate more&#13;
change.&#13;
One clear demonstration of this phenomenon was S0 Smilansky's&#13;
first kindergarten experiment (1964, pe27)o "Those whose initial score on&#13;
Stanford-Binet IQ was 79 and less averaged a rise of 29 points when they&#13;
experienced the "directive cognitive" approach and 18 points when in an&#13;
acceleraring-enriching" curriculum. When initial IQ was 90-99, the aver-&#13;
age rises were 17 and 14; and those with 110-119, only 109 points in the&#13;
directive approach and a decline of 3 points in the accelerating-enriching&#13;
control group.&#13;
Three explanations of this phenomenon are generally given by experts.&#13;
First, there is a statistical artifact called "regression toward the mean" in&#13;
repeated testing0 Campbell and Erlbacher say: "for each class of pre-test&#13;
scores, the corresponding mean post-test score lies close to the overall pop-&#13;
ulation mean, post-test values being thereby lower in the case of high pre-&#13;
test values and higher in the case of lower pretest values0" 1/ Second, it&#13;
is possible that those originally scoring lower come from more deprived home&#13;
environments and perform much below their potentialities, and that an appro-&#13;
priate "nourishing" program accelerates their progress toward a higher&#13;
;'threshold" of performance0 Also, it is possible that the available programs&#13;
are geared to the children with lower initial ability and do not produce the&#13;
necessary challenge for the children initially with a higher level of coO1-&#13;
petence0&#13;
1/   "How regression artifacts in quasi-experimental evaluation can mistakenly&#13;
make compensatory education look harmful," in The Disadvantaged Chl:d,&#13;
Vol. 3, 1970, pp. 185-211.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
The last hypothesis prompted S. Smilansky in Jerusalem, Weikart&#13;
et al. in Ypsilanti, and Deutsch et al. in New York to develop special&#13;
programs for the more gifted among disadvantaged preschoolers. Because&#13;
these attempts also did not produce significant results, the first two&#13;
explanations are probably more likely for the majority of cases. Other&#13;
results from more differentiated fostering experiments might affect our&#13;
present summary.&#13;
Herzog (1974) labeled what may seem to be a contradiction with&#13;
the slogan "double deprivation: the less they have, the less they learn."&#13;
Herzog, using a traditio,.al midda-class program (although very intensive&#13;
and rich) found that the children who came from the higher socio-economic&#13;
classes and resembled the middle socio-economic class were the ones who&#13;
benefited most. But a partial explanation of her results may be that the&#13;
disadvantaged children had to adapt to a traditional middle-class social&#13;
climate in her program.&#13;
(c) For most students in the successful experimental projects, the gain&#13;
in IQ is maintained as long as intervention continues, but in general.&#13;
only up to the end of the second grade.&#13;
In the projects discussed (and in other similar projects), the&#13;
experimental group maintained its gains for two or more years, either with&#13;
continued fostering support by the researchers, or through entry into the&#13;
public schools.   But chere are aisu exampleb uf expefieatal groups that&#13;
after termination of intervention, or a year later, experienced regression&#13;
in IQ scores. In another context we shall discuss possible interpretations&#13;
of these results.&#13;
(d) According to longitudinal evaluations, with few exceptions, the control&#13;
group gradually made up the gains shown by the experimental group.&#13;
Usually, the control group closed half the gap (toward the experimental&#13;
group) in the first grade, and eliminated anv significant difference&#13;
toward the end of the second grade.&#13;
The longitudinal data of S. Smilansky (1964) in Jerusalem and&#13;
Hodges et al. in Indiana (1967) illustrate the typical pattern. Although&#13;
the cultural groups, the sampled populations, and the programs of fostering&#13;
were very different, the patterns oi progress for the experimental and control&#13;
groups were similar. In both settings, the mean change in IQ for the experi-&#13;
mental groups accelerated in preschool. Then during the first grade, about&#13;
half of the gap was closed by the steady progress of the control groups, and&#13;
toward the end of the second grade the differences were not significant. In&#13;
some experiments, small differences were still evident a year or two later&#13;
(up to the third grade in the study of Weikart and up to the fourth grade&#13;
only in one study by Gray).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
This general picture appeared even where the experimenters con-&#13;
tinued their special intervention with a follow-through program in the primary&#13;
grades (see S. Smilansky, Deutsch, Weikart, and Gray). In some cases, the gap&#13;
between the experimental and control groups closed because of regression in&#13;
the experimental group's IQ.&#13;
Because these results have been replicated with different age groups&#13;
using the same experimental approach and in other very different preschool&#13;
experiments, the concept of "acceleration" of IQ level seems a proper inter-&#13;
pretation of the contribution of the successful experiments. This is in&#13;
contrast to an assumption that preschool fostering may produce a "transfor-&#13;
mation" in the pattern of thinking and learning, as measured by tests used for&#13;
these age groups.&#13;
(e) In general, prolonging preschool special fostering for more than one vear&#13;
does not produce additional gains for the experimental groups,&#13;
In the experiments of S. Smilansky (1964), Deutsch et al. (1962-&#13;
1969), Gray and Klaus (1962-1968), Hodges et al. (1967), etc., the signLficant&#13;
change occurred in the first year. Continuation of fostering efforts for&#13;
one or more yearb, or replication with an earlier start and a longer span&#13;
program, did nut produc,- additional benefits, when the criterion is upgrading&#13;
IQ.  In the early h rry preschool evaluation (Weikart, 1967) most of the&#13;
groups even demonstrated an IQ regression in the second year. Even a very in-&#13;
tensive and high powered fostering program that continued for five years (in&#13;
preschool and primary grades) did not produce more significant differences --&#13;
with low level disadvantaged groups -- than did a one-year initial input (see&#13;
Deutsch et al (1974) for an extreme demonstration from a high quality foster-&#13;
ing program).&#13;
Exceptions are reports by Bereiter and Engelmaii (1966) and&#13;
V4an de Riet et al. (1970) that show a cumulative improvement in the first&#13;
year of school fostering added to a kindergarten year, or a nursery year&#13;
added to a kindergarten year. In Head Start, the Westinghouse evaluation&#13;
(Cicirelli et al., 1969) showed a limited positive increase in a one-year&#13;
program, but no significant change during a summer program, while a parallel&#13;
evaluation by Datta (1969) did not show a better IQ growtn in a whole year&#13;
than in a summer program.&#13;
From reading the different reports and observing different programs,&#13;
we assume that the conflicting evidence may be explained more by the nature&#13;
of the programs under consideration (management, curriculum, population) and&#13;
the design of evaluation than by the time factor. It seems that there is a&#13;
threshold variable concept. By that we mean that a type of intervention is&#13;
able to accelerate an intellectual growth process through Lts mediating&#13;
specific learning pattern variables.   For most children the minimum threshold&#13;
is approximately a school year input that provides the mediation, while for&#13;
others two years may be needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
These generalizations relate to IQ change.    For skill development&#13;
and knowledge acquisition, additional time may be an important or even a&#13;
crucial variable (for illustration see studies of IEA International Evalua-&#13;
tion of Achievement, 1967-73, Levy and Chen (1974) on school achievement in&#13;
Israel, and Law (1974) on school achievement in California).&#13;
(f) The precise chronological age at which preschool intervention is intro-&#13;
duced does not seem to produce significant differences in the potential&#13;
for IQ change.&#13;
In the experiments of Weikart et al, S. Smilansky, Deutsch et al.,&#13;
Karnes, Gray and Klaus, etc., preschool intervention was introduced at ages&#13;
of three, four, or five. For some groups the term of the intervention was&#13;
only one year, while for others it was two or three years. In terms of IQ,&#13;
the age of entry into preschool did not produce significant differences.&#13;
This generalization seems to be true for both the immediate change at the end&#13;
of the program and the long-range effect.&#13;
For this point the experiment by Hodges, McCandless and Spicker&#13;
(1967) in Indiana made a special contribution. In certain regions of the&#13;
State preschools and kindergarten classrooms were not available.    So in&#13;
addition to comparing their experimental "diagnostically based" curriculum&#13;
with a "traditional" curriculum, they were also able to compare with a group&#13;
entering directly from home (without preschool) into the first grade. The&#13;
table of their results demonstrates clearly that those who did not have the&#13;
benefit of preschool and kindergarten entered first grade with a lower IQ&#13;
(relative to both the experimental and the traditional preschool groups),&#13;
but were catching up during the first grade and closed the gap, produced by&#13;
the "diagnostically based" curriculum intervention, toward the end of the&#13;
second grade.&#13;
Contributing additional support to this point are the infant experi-&#13;
ments -- both home-based and institution-based. When the first wave of&#13;
preschool and kindergarten experiments showed less long-range impact than&#13;
expected, one proposition by many researchers was that preschool age is&#13;
too late. Out of this feeling -- supported by different theoretical assump-&#13;
tions -- emerged a wave of infant and toddler fostering programs. As in&#13;
preschools and kindergartens, these programs were developed in different&#13;
research and service centers, by different researchers, using different&#13;
assumptions and developing different programs. As will be described later,&#13;
some of these intervention programs were home-based, some center-based, and&#13;
some integrated home tutoring with center demonstrations and group discussions.&#13;
Ihe more successful infant projects obtained results very similar to those in&#13;
preschools and kindergartens. For example, Palmer (1968), Schaefer (1971),&#13;
Karnes et al. (1970) working with two-year-olds (but using different methods&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
and working in different geographic areas) produced about 14-16 points of IQ&#13;
change. 1/&#13;
Also, the evidence from a large-scale international comparative&#13;
study of matiematics achievement (Husen et al., 1967) supports the general-&#13;
ization about the limited relevance of the age of entry to schooling and the&#13;
number of years in school to impact school achievement. In this study,&#13;
results on mathematics tests at age 13 have no positive correlation with&#13;
the fact that in Israel and England compulsory education begins at the age&#13;
of five, in Germany and Japan at six, and in Sweden (like in Russia) at&#13;
seven.&#13;
This suggests that if the concept of plasticity is interpreted&#13;
as the capacity to significantly change IQ, then at least the first 7-8&#13;
years of life can be considered an appropriate period for fostering (pre-&#13;
ventive, promotive, and rehabilitative), and no one age proves to be a&#13;
more "crucial" or "sensitive" or "critical" period. While the assumptions&#13;
of sensitive period and plasticity have some support in the available stu-&#13;
dies, the concept of critical period, with irreversible effect, borrowed&#13;
from animal experiments by Lorenz, Harlow, etc. does not have evidence&#13;
to support it.&#13;
(g) There is evidence that a comprehensive, longitudinal, sophisticated&#13;
and expensive fostering program can produce sustained results.&#13;
For this generalization, we have evidence from two very different&#13;
sources. First, a small-scale, longitudinal study by Heber et al. (1972)&#13;
in Wisconsin of a sample of black mothers (with WAIS IQs of less than 75,&#13;
from a socially depressed area) and their infants focused on educational&#13;
and vocational rehabilitation of the mother, her training for child-rearing,&#13;
and intellectual fostering of her infant in the center -- from the third&#13;
month of life up to school entrance. Ihey say (p. 105):&#13;
At 36 months, there is a 30 point difference in mean&#13;
IQ performance (betx.een experimental and control&#13;
groups); at 48 months there is a 31 point difference;&#13;
L(id at 60 months, there is a 26 point difference&#13;
between the groups.   At 66 months ... an IQ difference&#13;
of 30 points. The present data, in all areas of per-&#13;
formance measured, clearly indicate a marked superior-&#13;
ity. However, interpretation of and generalizations&#13;
i/   Of course one should be aware that at different chronological ages&#13;
the IQ (intelligence quotient) or DQ (developmental quotient used&#13;
in infancy tests) measure different capabilities -- during infancy&#13;
the sensory-motor items predominate while in preschool and kinder-&#13;
garten language plays the major role.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
based upon present data must be tempered by the recog-&#13;
nition of the test sophistication which has obviously&#13;
been acquired, and by knowledge of previous enrichment&#13;
studies where treatment gains (particularly in tested&#13;
1Qs) have not tended to be maintained over long post-&#13;
treatment periods.&#13;
Their follow-up study in school should be reported before a final judgement&#13;
is made.&#13;
The second source is an M. Smilansky et al. (1968, 1977) study of in-&#13;
tellectual development of kibbutz-born children. Children born in a kibbutz&#13;
of parents of Middle-Eastern and North-African backgrounds who had elementary&#13;
education or less-scored, at middle grades of primary school and early ado-&#13;
lescence, a mean Wechsler verbal IQ of 109; the mean IQ for children of&#13;
similar backgrounds living in urban settings in Israel was around 95. The&#13;
lcibbutz is a unique demonstration of success due to comprehensive, intensive,&#13;
and long-range fostering from infancy, although even there a gap according&#13;
to parental education of children is evident from our data. Such results&#13;
suggest that intervention that focuses on the family and school environment in&#13;
a mutually supportive, long-term fashion may promote long-range intellectual&#13;
development.&#13;
(h) "rraditional" preschools produce very limited change in IQ, although&#13;
they may have some other positive contribution.&#13;
There is a great deal of evidence for this point from many of&#13;
the studies already discussed. For example, Stearns (1971, p. 20), sum-&#13;
marizing evidence from different evaluations, said: "The general finding&#13;
of these studies was that children in the experimental groups got higher&#13;
post-test IQ scores than traditional nursery school groups and the tradi-&#13;
tional groups got higher scores than children remaining at home." And&#13;
more clearly, Di Lorenzo (p.1-2, 1969), after reporting on the acceleration&#13;
in IQ of the experimental group, added "...these results were achieved&#13;
only by cognitively oriented programs and not by nursery or early child-&#13;
hood oriented programs."&#13;
At the same time, how the impacts of various cognitively oriented&#13;
programs differ is a very complex issue. As only a brief illustration,&#13;
Weikart (1969) conducted comparative experiments with three alternative&#13;
curricula. He says that in three repeated trials all groups showed similar&#13;
post-test gains. At the same time, Karnes (1969) attempted to define struc-&#13;
tures of programs and found a hierarchy of results for the various pro-&#13;
grams -- her "ameliorative" at the top, then "direct verbal," then "tradi-&#13;
tional," then Montessori, and last, the "community-integrated." Again, these&#13;
were immediate impact results; control groups in other experiments (T Wikart,&#13;
et al. (1969), Hodges, et al. (1967), S. Smilansky (1964), IKaus and Gray&#13;
(1968), etc.) gradually were catching up during the primary grades.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14 -&#13;
A statement by Sigel, Director of Educational Testing Child Care&#13;
Research Center (ETS Developments, Vol. XII, No. 3, Summer 1975), expresses&#13;
the traditional point of view of "progressive" education (po 5):&#13;
The purpose of the nursery school is not acceleration&#13;
or to push children in cognitive areaso Rather, it&#13;
provides enrichment of the "givens" -- the traits the&#13;
children already have -- with emphasis on permitting&#13;
the children to move into directions where they can&#13;
go. It is enrichment of the whole social fabrics of&#13;
their lives. If acceleration does occur, it is simply&#13;
a bonus -- the result of enriched experience.&#13;
It is clear from the available evidence of research in the tech-&#13;
nologically and economically advanced countries that one cannot expect a&#13;
transformation in cognitive capacity from regular public preschool educa-&#13;
tion - the effect of "traditional" preschool in developing countries is&#13;
even more questionable. The more successful experimental programs used&#13;
highly educated teachers and one or more aides for about 15 students. "Pro-&#13;
gressive" nurseries of the type Sigel advocates have similar ratios and&#13;
in the kibbutz the ratio of adults per child is even higher0 The financLal&#13;
resources and quality of personnel required for such programs in public&#13;
education are not available even in the United States (where there is today&#13;
an over-supply of professional teachers)0 When we ask ourselves about special&#13;
priority to preschool intervention in developing countries, the available&#13;
evidence seems to suggest a negative reply0&#13;
(i) The trends in IQ changes as described seem to be similar for different&#13;
ethnic groups and geographic localities.&#13;
What may be considered a limiting factor in our summary of evidence&#13;
is that most of the experiments discussed were in the U.S. and some were in&#13;
Israel. The experiments should be replicated in other countries; nevert.he-&#13;
less, there is evidence for the assumption that the data have implications for&#13;
other nations0 The Israeli experiments included large numbers of immigrants&#13;
who originated from Yemen, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Libya, and Morocco0 No signif-&#13;
icant difference was found in the initial level of IQ (when socio-economaic&#13;
status and education of parents was held constant) and in the patterns of&#13;
acceleration and stability0 In the U.S. the Hodges et al. (1967) study of&#13;
white lower class children from Indiana, the Deutsch et al. (1974) studies of&#13;
black children in Harlem, New York; the Weikart et al. (1970) studies of black&#13;
children in Ypsilanti, Michigan; and the Klaus and Gray (1968) studies in the&#13;
black South showed generally similar results -- both among the American&#13;
groups and in comparison to the Israeli groups0 Replication of S, Smilansky's&#13;
Israeli experiments in cognitive fostering through socio-dramatic play,&#13;
drawing, and clay (Mooney and Smilansky, S., 1973) with black and Appalachian&#13;
white preschool and kindergarten children also suggest that there is more&#13;
similarity in the problems of cognitive deficiency and cognitive fostering&#13;
than may have been assumed0 The fact that through the use of similar tests,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
like the Stanford-Binet, very similar trends in the results have been achieved&#13;
in very different settings supports a proposition"that a least in "Western"&#13;
type, technologically advanced, urbanized societies, the generalizations we&#13;
specified can be accepted as valid -- at least, until further replications in&#13;
other cultural settings become available, or until experiments with different&#13;
approaches demonstrate the limitations of the previous experiments.&#13;
(j) Parental involvement in early childhood education program has produced&#13;
significant results.&#13;
Parallel to programs of institutional fostering of young children&#13;
(in infant centers, day-care centers, preschools, and kindergartens), a&#13;
whole range of parental involvement experiments was developed, mainly during&#13;
the past decade of compensatory education. These programs can be classified&#13;
according to different dimensions. We shall first discuss classification&#13;
according to base of operation.&#13;
In home-based, parent-oriented programs, a mother is instructed in&#13;
her home to improve her competence in child-rearing. Some programs are com-&#13;
prehensive, including self-improvement, family life, and home economics, in&#13;
addition to child development; other programs limit their scope, concentrating&#13;
on cognitive stimulation. Mbst programs focus on one child, of a specific age,&#13;
in each family. Different media are used to facilitate improvement, for ex-&#13;
ample, demonstrations to the mother on how to enrich her verbal interaction&#13;
with her child and toy demonstrations.&#13;
In center-based demonstration of child-rearing, the focus remains&#13;
on the mother-child interaction, but the place of the mother's education is&#13;
in a center, with lectures and demonstrations of improved care practices,&#13;
with actual involvement of the mother in the child care role in the center,&#13;
or with group discussions, etc.&#13;
For programs combining home and center activity, the reasoning&#13;
may be economic efficiency or social-psychological and pedagogical reason-&#13;
ing (like value of reference group and group discussion). In some cases,&#13;
it is a child-education, institutionally based program with additional in-&#13;
volvement of parents; in others, the center is used solely for the improve-&#13;
ment of performance in the parental role.&#13;
Another dimension is age. Nearly all programs focus on a specific&#13;
age group. Generally it is infant care (0-2), toddler care (2-3), preschool&#13;
(3-5), kindergarten (5), or primary grades of the elementary school. Usually&#13;
there are theortical assumptions about the crucial role of that age for child&#13;
development or mother competency or both; in other cases, the age group&#13;
selected is a by-product of the role the institution (an infant center or&#13;
preschool, etc.).&#13;
P rental involvement programs can also be classified by goals&#13;
of the initiating agency. A women's organization, or a research institute,&#13;
may aim at increasing self-esteem and the coping capacity of women from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
disadvantaged families. A preschool may be attempting to increase its&#13;
program impact on child development. A community center may be interested&#13;
in serving the needs of its area population. Or a mother-child health&#13;
clinic, which originally was involved in standard mother guidance and infant&#13;
care with physical check-ups, nutritional advice, etc., may recognize the&#13;
need for a program in cognitive fostering of infants. Some programs have&#13;
differentiated behavior-oriented development goals and task specifications,&#13;
while others have only general orientations in the physical, cognitive, and&#13;
affective domains.&#13;
One could also discuss programs according LU other dimensions,&#13;
for example, length of time in program and length of engagement in a week.,&#13;
the staff employed (professional, para-professional -- paid or volunteer)&#13;
the role of the staff (home contact, education, demonstration, facilita-&#13;
tion), program manaRement (research center, health center, teacher of pre-&#13;
school or school, women's organiztion, parent cooperative responsibility,&#13;
etc.) It is beyond the scope of this memorandum to discuss the many im-&#13;
plications of these variables, although some will be mentioned in the pres-&#13;
entation of the evidence which follows0&#13;
Because of space limitation we shall summarize the results of&#13;
parental involvement programs that seem most relevant to our discussion0&#13;
As for the preschool programs the main evidence is from programs that were&#13;
evaluated longitudinally; we will focus on programs that we assume other&#13;
experts will accept as appropriate (considering the limitations discussed&#13;
in our introduction)0&#13;
(i) Parent involvement programs produced results as good as those&#13;
of preschool, and in some ways, the results were even better0 Ihe programs&#13;
that were initiated by Gray and Klaus (1970, 1974), Levenstein (1976), I.&#13;
Gordon (1969), E   Go rdon (1971), Weikart et al. (1970) , Arnes et al. (1970),&#13;
Ortar (1973), Lombard (1973), and others demonstrated the possibility of&#13;
involving mothers in a change process -- producing as great an acceleration&#13;
in their child's IQ as that produced in an institutional program (infant&#13;
center or preschool) and in some cases, maintaining the gain for a longer&#13;
period after termination of intervention0   Gray and KL aus (see 1968, 1972,&#13;
1974) initiated their experiment in 1962 which was a 10-week summer pro-&#13;
gram of preschool and home visits0 The mean rise in IQ was 15 points and.&#13;
although later there was a decline, the superior status (as compared with&#13;
the control group) was maintained for four years after the intervention0 As&#13;
with preschool programs, the control group closed the gap during the first&#13;
primary school years0 levenstein (1976) began her home toy and book demcn-&#13;
stration project in 1965. She aimed to promote mother-toddler verbal inter-&#13;
action and cognitively oriented growth -- during two years (ages 2-3). In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
five successive groups, IQ was raised 15 points and the difference over the&#13;
control group was maintained 3-4 years after termination. 1/&#13;
When we say that parent-oriented programs achieved even better&#13;
results than preschool programs, we refer not only to longer-term relative&#13;
superiority of IQ through a shorter-term intervention. Also important is&#13;
the evidence of a positive impact on mothers -- many raised their self-&#13;
esteem, sought further education, or were employed as semi-professional&#13;
workers in the same project (Levenstein, "Toy Demonstrators" and Gordon,&#13;
I. J., "Follow Through Program Educators").&#13;
One possible explanation for the longer impact of these programs&#13;
is the continued mother self-involvement after program termination. Also&#13;
there is evidence from Gray (1968), and two other projects, on a vertical&#13;
diffusion to younger siblings and possibly even horizontal diffusion to&#13;
neighbors (some belonging to the control group and thus contaminating the&#13;
results).&#13;
The hypothesis about the causes of this relatiyely powerful&#13;
impact on mothers' education are: first, that these projects create im-&#13;
proved cognitively oriented, as well as affectively based, mother-child&#13;
communication; second, that the mother is building new awareness of self&#13;
as educator and of the child's cognitive needs from infancy; and finally,&#13;
that the change in the child's capabilities and expectations has immediate&#13;
impact on the mother's reaction in the dyadic interaction in general, and&#13;
dialogue pattern in particular.&#13;
At the same time, we should repeat that the main limiting factor&#13;
in preschool child-oriented education is evident also in mother-oriented&#13;
education. For example, Gray (1974) started in 1964 with a group of black&#13;
children who had a mean IQ of 81 and raised IQ to 96 two years later, and&#13;
in a 1969 follow-up year, their mean IQ was 92. The control group started&#13;
at 85, reached 90, and in 1966 was 87. The 5-point difference was compar-&#13;
able to that found by M. Deutsch (1974) in the 5-year intensive preschool&#13;
and "follow through" intensive investment but well below expectations.&#13;
(ii)  Home-based and combined home- and center-based Rrograms seem&#13;
to produce similar results, according to S. Smilansky and Shefatiah (in&#13;
Israel, 1976) who tried experimentally at first only home-based programs&#13;
and later tried additional meetings in a center away from home. Their&#13;
results were similar to those of Johnson et al. (1974) in a mother-child&#13;
center in Texas. It seems that for economy as well as for provision of&#13;
1/   However, her report of 1976 with a randomly chosen experimental and&#13;
control group shows only a 5-point difference at termination of two-&#13;
year fostering and raises questions about possible selective factors&#13;
in her previous groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18 Â°&#13;
group experiences to mothers, some combination may be preferred. Of course,&#13;
the final outcome depends on the composition of parents in a certain popuala-&#13;
tion and in some cases on the specific goals of the program.&#13;
(iii) Adding a parental involvement program to a presrhool program does&#13;
not increase children's cognitive development0 Smilansky, S0 and Shefatiah&#13;
in Israel and 1arnes, et al. in the U.S. explored child cognitive development&#13;
through fostering both in a preschool and in the home. These studies also&#13;
found evidence of a 15-point rise in the IQ of the experimental group and the&#13;
"catching up" of the control group over time0 While parent involvement in&#13;
institutional programs rudy be recommended for certain social and psychological&#13;
reasons, it cannot be expected to affect significantly the tempo and mode of&#13;
cognitive change in the child0 Also when we consider overburdened mothers&#13;
with responsibility for a large family, or mothers who have to work for income&#13;
and family care, there may be no justification to add additional pressure on&#13;
the mother to develop cognitive abilities0 Another consideration may be the&#13;
evidence that under some circumstances certain mothers with large families&#13;
tend to neglect other children's or their husbands' needs when involved in the&#13;
one-to-one fostering program with one child0 Finally the program may produce&#13;
problems relating to feelings of incompetence, or pressure in actual home&#13;
management for the mothers.&#13;
(iv) In parent-oriented programs, the time factor is a significant:&#13;
variable0  There is evidence from Gordon, I0 J0 et al. (1975), and others&#13;
who work in this area, that the time of entry (the earlier the better),&#13;
the length of time with program (the longer the better), and the consis-&#13;
tency of program (the more consistent involvement with the programs the&#13;
better) combined to produce the higher IQ levels of the experimental groups&#13;
and their relative gains were maintained for three years after the end of&#13;
project0 According to a levenstein (1975) report, a two-year program with&#13;
mothers (children's ages 2-3) produced more powerful impact than a program&#13;
of shorter duration. Other evidence showed that bi-weekly, weekly, or&#13;
semi-weekly home visits produce no significant differences0&#13;
(v) Para-professionals performed the expected roles as well as pro-&#13;
fessionals did0 levenstein started her experiment with social workers holding&#13;
master's degrees0 With subsequent groups, in the same center and in many&#13;
other centers, she used para-professionals who were project mothers and&#13;
received the same impact on child development0 Gordon states (1975, po&#13;
III-40) that in his program "it was demonstrated that low income para-&#13;
professionals could indeed effect change in development of disadvantaged&#13;
infants and toddlers0" lombard (1973) in Israel also used para-professionals&#13;
successfully in her project, and the same result occurred in many other&#13;
projects that we visited or reviewed0 Of course, in all projects there is&#13;
need for initial training of a professional coordinator-supervisor, initial&#13;
short-term training of para-professionals, and in-service supervision of para-&#13;
professionals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
The benefits of using local para-professionals are: first, that&#13;
in a well-designed program, gradual diffusion beyond the specific program is&#13;
more likely; second, that mothers accept more favorably facilitators coming&#13;
from their own ethnic or social class group; third, that the lower salary&#13;
levels and the use of volunteers keep costs relatively lower; fourth, that&#13;
many mothers who persevere in the program see an option for later paid work&#13;
positions; and finally, that the project budget may attract additional&#13;
political backing since the funds allocated for the disadvantaged are not&#13;
diverted to groups outside the target community.&#13;
(vi) Program goals and actual performance are limited to mothers.&#13;
With one or two exceptions (for example, weekend parent education programs),&#13;
the many programs we reviewed (and others known to experts in this field)&#13;
made no serious attempts to involve fathers, adolescents who are the future&#13;
parents, or grandparents. In some cases the theoretical reasoning is that&#13;
the mother is the primary source of child-care and child security in early&#13;
childhood, so her involvement is basic to the desired socialization of the&#13;
infant and toddler. In other cases, it is added that in a large family in&#13;
poverty areas, mothers are so over-burdened and even depressed (both by&#13;
their overwhelming responsibilities and their low status) that they need&#13;
psychological and practical support to continue to cope with their respon-&#13;
sibilities, and to improve their role performance. Other, more practical&#13;
reasoning is that in reality fathers are not available or not ready to&#13;
participate.&#13;
V. CONCLUSIONS&#13;
liken as a whole, the results of the preschool programs aimed to&#13;
foster the cognitive development of children in disadvantaged families do&#13;
not justify giving special priority to investment in such preschool programs.&#13;
Although IQ may be raised by some preschool programs, the gains are often&#13;
not significant and regardless of program are maintained only for a few years;&#13;
most studies showed that the gains were evident only until the second grade.&#13;
In particular, "traditional" preschools have been able to produce only very&#13;
limited gains in IQ. Long-term, intensive, and expensive programs may pro-&#13;
duce sustained gains, but when financial resources are constrained such&#13;
programs are not feasible.&#13;
Preschool programs that involve parents show promise. Some have&#13;
produced IQ gains as large as those produced in child-centered preschool&#13;
programs. Besides improving cognitive ability, there have been benefits to&#13;
mothers involved in the programs -- many raised their self-esteem, sought&#13;
further education, or became employed through the projects. Because para-&#13;
professionals and volunteers have been successful in carrying out the goals&#13;
of some programs, the costs of the parental involvement program are poten-&#13;
tially lower than for other preschool programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
0o t&#13;
nowever, adding a pareEtal MIwo eont program to a child-centered&#13;
preschool program does not produce EG@at@E Vain   in children's IQs than would&#13;
an experimental preschool alone or a p eeat-oriented program alone. Since&#13;
parent-oriented programs have impo tat poGitive side effects in additioa to&#13;
promoting __gnitive development, It Io gecomaeuded that programs with poten-&#13;
tial to building the family be given cqwderation as a direction for future&#13;
program development.&#13;

WHY PRIORITY TO ADOLESCENCE?&#13;
I. Issues of Adolescence&#13;
C^)  The concept "adolescence" is relatively new.    The term was&#13;
created to describe what is mainly a by-product of the forces of moderniza-&#13;
tion. The modernization process is different in different societies, but we&#13;
can describe it in very broad sociological terms. In traditional agrarian&#13;
societies children were socialized in the institution of the extended family&#13;
and the socio-cultural system of the community. Through "natural" involvement&#13;
and identification with culturally prescribed sex-roles they generally adapted&#13;
very early to home, work, and community expectations; and certain initiation&#13;
rites and forced realities facilitated the transformation from childhood into&#13;
young adulthood. First came adult-type work responsibilities and later&#13;
privileges and social status prescribed by sex role and age role. Industrial-&#13;
ism and urbanism gradually brought fragmentation. These developments also&#13;
forced mobility, fragmentation of the extended family and the community, and&#13;
separation into isolated nuclear families, as well as age groups. The scien-&#13;
tific revolution, industrialism, urbanism, and secularism converged, opening&#13;
many new options, but also contributing to the emergence of large-scale&#13;
problems and crises. It affected, in a unique way, roles and status --&#13;
according to sex and age groups -- of adolescents, women, and the elderly.&#13;
In psychological terms, Stanley Hall "discovered" certain manifes-&#13;
tations of these age cohorts in America in the 1890's; and in his book Adoles-&#13;
cence: Its psychology and its relation to physiology, anthropology, socio-&#13;
logy, sex, crime, religion and education created the universal label&#13;
"adolescence" (1904).   In parallel, Sigmund Freud in his "Three Essays in&#13;
the Theory of Sexuality" (1905) provided the original psycho-analytical&#13;
interpretation on the transformation of puberty, which served as a foundation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
for many later in-depth pioneering studies, by anthropologists and psychologists,&#13;
of adolescent phenomena. Margaret Mead (1928), and later other anthropolo-&#13;
gists and sociologists, questioned the universality of adolescent manifes-&#13;
tations using evidence from preliterate tribes, and maay psychologists and&#13;
other behavior scientists questioned certain phenomena and interpretations.&#13;
But for our discussion, it is more important that in all technologically&#13;
advanced societies, and gradually also in developing countries, adolescence&#13;
is a reality and a problem that must be confronted by all those involved --&#13;
adolescents, parents, and social institutions.&#13;
(b) Adolescence is a marginal and problematic position. In&#13;
sociological perspective, the cohorts in "adolescence" are persons grouped&#13;
by the modernization process into age-stratified, marginal, prolonged&#13;
dependency with relatively little power or status. Because maturity --&#13;
physical, cognitive, and social -- is accelerated, they are not children;&#13;
but because societies do not need them for socio-economic and defense sur--&#13;
vival and consider them immature for adult roles'and status, protected&#13;
environments for custodial and socialization purposes are created for&#13;
them. This protection of adolescents is expressed by compulsory legal&#13;
arrangements (compulsory education laws, work permit laws, age for&#13;
marriage and alcoholic drinking laws, dress and hair-style codes, and&#13;
night curfew regulations) and the creation of segregated custodial and&#13;
socialization reservations called secondary schools and adult-dominated&#13;
youth organizations0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
We are considering adolescence a by-product of modernization. Many&#13;
forces affected this evolutionary social process. Mechanization of production&#13;
and services separated work-roles and work-place from home, and role and&#13;
status became defined according to task assignments. This made child and&#13;
youth work unnecessary, and even competitive, with adult work. In parallel,&#13;
scientific, technological, and social developments increased the pressure for&#13;
prolonged learning and continued schooling. Family planning limited the&#13;
number of children and improved economic conditions, while urbanism and the&#13;
growth of the service sector facilitated middle-class value orientation and&#13;
democratization of prolonged education in school.&#13;
The post-World War II pressure toward secondary democratization&#13;
of education facilitated prolonged schooling in comprehensive institutions and&#13;
the "baby boom" contributed crash programs for growth in size of schools. So,&#13;
large numbers of students in large institutions were socialized by mass-pro-&#13;
duced teachers and curriculum. The need for efficient schooling for larger&#13;
age groups created the age-grade classroom stratification (Aries, 1962).&#13;
Children thus became isolated from family and community involvement and were&#13;
expected to develop the necessary qualities of psycho-social maturity during&#13;
prolonged socialization in a fragmented and competitive age-graded classroom&#13;
and institution.&#13;
At the same time, the scientific revolution, technological devel-&#13;
opments, and secularism contributed to earlier maturation of adolescents&#13;
(Tanner, 1962) and their earlier escape from innocence (Bachman, 1970, 1971;&#13;
Yankelovich, 1973). They cannot be treated as innocent adaptive children,&#13;
but they are also not considered equal to adults and accepted to share in&#13;
the co-determination of their immediate needs and their future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 &#13;
(c) There is ambiguity of feelings toward adolescents. It is&#13;
important to recognize that an ambiguous psychological feeling and social.&#13;
reaction by adults toward the termination of childhood have been evident&#13;
throughout history, as demonstrated by anthropological studies of primitive&#13;
societies. In a tribal homogeneouOs culture, evolving rules and mores were&#13;
inherited and accepted by parencs and children. Both child and mother had&#13;
to face abrupt transformation of attachment -- and adaptation to new roles&#13;
and status -- facilitated mainly through different forms of "rites de passage"0&#13;
The torture of separation-transformation rites (Thurnwald, 196.1;&#13;
Landman, 1927; Byrk, 1928; Whiting, 1941; Mayer, 1953; Muensterberger, 1956;&#13;
Nash, 1958) were an expression of hostility by the old toward the youngo The&#13;
rites aimed to force the severence of son-mother ties, arouse sexual desire&#13;
but facilitate sexual role adjustment, ridicule the non-readiness for adiult&#13;
sex-role whether in intercourse or in work and thereby foster it, pressure for&#13;
conformity to community social order, and prepare the young for future adult&#13;
hardships, according to sex role and status.&#13;
Today adolescence is recognized as a need for adaptation, through a&#13;
gradual, prolonged, socialization process, biologically based but culturally&#13;
oriented, with the transition from childhood to adulthood taking 6-8 years0&#13;
Some of the same basic social-psychological ambiguities exist,&#13;
but in context of a transition to a new stage and pattern of interrelations0&#13;
Prolonged adolescent dependency is a very recent social phenomenon0 It&#13;
emerged and accelerated in the U.S. through the depression of the 30's and ehe&#13;
"great society" of the 60's0 In Europe it was mainly influenced by the&#13;
successive crises of two world wars and the emerging welfare-state during the&#13;
last two decades0 Such accelerated social change, the fragmentation of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
extended family and the community, and the disruption of the cultural norms&#13;
explains some of the inability of the family, the school, and the social order&#13;
to confront the emerging adolescent and parent needs. In the present phase&#13;
of modernization, mass communication and education create guilt feelings in&#13;
parents, teachers, and children about what they have done and what they could&#13;
have been doing and experiencing. This, of course, increases the reason for&#13;
and the experience of ambiguity.&#13;
In traditional societies there was less ambiguity because of in-&#13;
nocence. Knowledge about alternative options was not available in the geo-&#13;
political "closed systems"; awareness of potential danger to mental, or even&#13;
physical, health could not be considered; and even when the rites were in fact&#13;
crises-prone, there was the deferred gratification of becoming a dominating&#13;
adult in a patriarchal or matrilineal traditional system.&#13;
Another aspect of the social phenomena expressing the ambiguity of&#13;
parent-adolescent relations is expressed in the labeling of the current period&#13;
as the "adolescent" or "youth" age. The "youth culture" is dominant as is&#13;
evident from mass communication and personal orientation and behavior in&#13;
grooming, dress, music, recreation, etc. In a traditional society, adults&#13;
enjoyed their mature age status and played their roles accordingly. Children&#13;
sought to model adults. They were role-playing as adults and looking forward&#13;
to adult roles. Today, in the instant-cultures of what some call post-indus-&#13;
trial societies, parents feel culturally deprived because they are not part of&#13;
a youth culture. The mass-communication media feature adolescent playful&#13;
models. Parents imitate their daughters' and sons' dress and grooming--or&#13;
even courting--seeing that as a mirror for keeping up with expectations to be&#13;
relevant and for gaining assurance against being outmoded in a generation gap.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
And at the same time, they speak against the youth culture with its "neg.ative"&#13;
manifestations, describing with nostalgia the good old days. They cannot&#13;
accept their child being different than they are. This psyche-social dilemma&#13;
raises the deep-seated question of ambiguity and psychological incongruence.&#13;
How can someone who is not secure in his self-identity and lacking in self-&#13;
esteem socialize the next generation with security of heritage?&#13;
The other side of this is that many adolescents find themselves with&#13;
no support and guidanceo The mass media continuously raises expectations,&#13;
parents are involved in their own adjustment to the accelerated modernization&#13;
process and their own actualization problem, and most schools seem to have&#13;
become large dehumanized bureaucratic institutions. The choice of many ado-&#13;
lescents is focused toward the outlet of peer systems which promise under-&#13;
standing, support, relevances escape from adult pressures, social status, and&#13;
maybe also the power "to be"0&#13;
(d) The adolescence groblem is especially acute and urgent for the&#13;
socially and culturally disadvantagedo Either because of immigration to a&#13;
very different socio-cultural ecology (from Mexico or Puerto Rico to the U.S0&#13;
or from Yemen and Morocco to Israel)(from rural agrarian tradition to urban&#13;
pressure, from fundamentalist affective religious dependence to secular&#13;
independence) or a fragmentation of familial and community structures and&#13;
norms for those born in an urban setting, the disadvantaged are victims of the&#13;
slum area configuration of forces0 For most of them, the family has lost (-or&#13;
did not develop) the necessary capability for relevant support, the school is&#13;
not adapted to their needs, work options are limited or unavailable, publicity&#13;
for affluent consumerism raises high expectations, the mass media suggests&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
modeling in dissonance with available resources, and the neighborhood ecology&#13;
strengthens these negative forces.&#13;
The problem for the disadvantaged adolescent could be described as&#13;
a "polluted" social environment, in which a feeling of powerlessness dominates&#13;
both parents and adolescents. And unless support becomes available to facil-&#13;
itate a powerful counterbalance intervention -- chrough cooperation of polit-&#13;
ical and educational facilitators with those concerned -- frustration and&#13;
waywardness will prevail for the majority. A minority will escape to other&#13;
ecological settings. But the escape of the more resourceful has an additional&#13;
negative impact on the disadvantaged area because it promotes a negative&#13;
self-image among those left behind, creates a "negative selection" process,&#13;
and allows a domination of the local scenery by socially marginal elements.&#13;
(e) Community ecology and socialization of the young is dependent&#13;
on adolescent behavior. Especially in culturally disadvantaged communities,&#13;
adolescents and youth serve as models to younger age cohorts, to their younger&#13;
siblings in particular.&#13;
In a process of accelerated modernization, parents lose, to a large&#13;
degree, their status and power as models for identification. Therefore,&#13;
younger children tend to follow value-orientations and behavioral manifesta-&#13;
tions of adolescents; adolescents tend to model young adults. Thus, the effect&#13;
of early childhood and primary education -- even when the programs are suc-&#13;
cessful in terms of direct and immediate measured results -- may be limited.&#13;
We should beware of producing diminishing returns by a "disequilibrium power&#13;
model". If the dominant group in a community cultural ecology is adolescents&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
and young adults and if they are frustrated and inadaptive, they will not&#13;
serve as effective models for younger children and, therefore, the impact of&#13;
early socialization schooling programs may be eroded.&#13;
II0 Adolescent Characteristics as a Basis for Fostering&#13;
(a)  Adolescence is a Rosition that may impact three generations.&#13;
First, adolescents are children of the past -- involved in the orientation&#13;
and coping of their family of origin. They are forming a past imagery,&#13;
present identity, and competence to share in the daily reality of their&#13;
family. At the same time, they are already experimenting to form their&#13;
future capabilities and options. Through their coupling patterns they are&#13;
building the second generation family, which in its physical and mental&#13;
health, cognitive competence, moral development, political inclinations,&#13;
socio-economic and affective role performance, etc9,will affect the quality&#13;
of life for a third generation. To those who believe in a primary prevention&#13;
approach -- for assurance of more appropriate development of coupling, sex&#13;
role identity, mental health, social competence, achievement motivation,&#13;
future mother health, family planning, infant well-being and development,&#13;
etc0 - a priority investment in adolescents is economically a very efficient&#13;
approach and socially a promising investment0&#13;
So, we suggest a priority to anticipatory socialization of adoles-&#13;
cents and youth -- for confrontation with value orientations, commitment to&#13;
chosen goals, and responsibility for self-development, coping, family build-&#13;
ing, and community development0 The confrontation with the meaning of t:heir&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
heritage, the options of the present and the emerging stage of modernization,&#13;
and a responsible interface with problems of developing futures -- these are&#13;
the focus for a learning process in adolescent education. Propositions about&#13;
effective environments for learning will be presented in the last section&#13;
of this paper.&#13;
(b)  There is evidence thdL jL%e i,pact of early childhood and&#13;
negative primary school experience may be reversed. In the paper on pre-&#13;
school, we discussed some of the propositions and supporting evidence&#13;
that family background and early childhood experiences impair personality&#13;
development. There is no question that a preventive and promotive approach&#13;
should be preferred to later rehabilitation, but the question is how early&#13;
and what are the appropriate designs for research and development. We&#13;
claim that powerful intervention designs for auring adoiescence promise a&#13;
preventive and promotive head start for tomorrow's family building, and&#13;
that family-oriented support provides a promise of both economic efficiency&#13;
and social equity. In parallel to the preferred preventive option, ado-&#13;
lescence should be considered in terms of rehabilitation. Despite the&#13;
ambiguity of feelings about adolescence by the public and the escape from&#13;
confrontation by policy-makers and high quality researchers and educa-&#13;
tors, there is an accumulation of evidence that a process ot reversibil-&#13;
ity should be considered, that there is no reason to give up on the op-&#13;
tion of rehabilitation. Powerful intervention designs during adolescence&#13;
promise both an immediate and long-range reward for certain groups of the&#13;
population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
The assumption that early childhood influences are imprinted on per-&#13;
sonality development and irreversible was accepted by psychologists from five&#13;
sources: first, Freudian teaching based on and extended from interpretation of&#13;
problem cases in treatment (Freud, S., 1963; Freud, A., 1965); second, many&#13;
studies of mother-child separation and institutional severe deprivation (Spitz,&#13;
1945; Goldfarb, 194,; boulby, 1952; Dennis, W. and Dennis, M.G., 1941);&#13;
third, the extension of animal laboratory experiments on imprinting (Lorenz,&#13;
K.L., 1971, 1972; Hess, E01H0, 1964) into human development, although no such&#13;
direct evidence was available from child psychology; fourth, longitudinal&#13;
studies that produced the evidence of correlation between home background in&#13;
early childhood and later development of IQ (Bloom, BoSo, 1964, and othetrs);&#13;
and last, the evidence of a growing gap in school achievement expressed by&#13;
the term "cumulative deficit" (see illustrated bibliography in Bloom, et: al0,&#13;
1964). But, human personality is a very complex phenomenon and contradictory&#13;
evidence has surfaced since World War II.&#13;
In World War II studies and later in reports from the California&#13;
Institute on adult personality research (McKinnon, 1960), adults whose early&#13;
childhood experiences were very negative were shown to cope successfully0&#13;
The analysis of data from longitudinal studies by Bayley (1949), Kagan mnd&#13;
Moss (1962), and McFarlane (1964) shows variability and low correlations&#13;
between early childhood manifestations and adult performance in different&#13;
areas of personality development. This may be interpreted as demonstrating&#13;
the reversibility of impact for some persons. Follow-up studies of institu-&#13;
tional deprivation in humans also show reversibility of early impact (Dennis,&#13;
1973; Tizzard and Rees, 1974)o Kagan and Klein (1973) reported on Guatemalan&#13;
children's recovery at adolescence from the impact of a very restrictive and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
depriving environment in infancy, although no special fostering program was&#13;
available.&#13;
Suomi and Harlow (1972) reported that in the same way that they&#13;
were able to demonstrate on monkeys the affective deprivation impact of&#13;
separation from mother, they also were able to produce the social rehabilita-&#13;
tion of isolate-reared monkeys. Later laboratory research has also demon-&#13;
strated that even imprinting in nonhumans can be reversed, as reported by&#13;
Hess (1972) and others. And reports from special fostering programs in&#13;
adolescence have shown not only immediate influence but in some cases long-&#13;
range impact.&#13;
To illustrate the results of adolescent fostering programs, we&#13;
shall discuss direct intervention attempts in Israel, since American studies&#13;
are probably easily available to those interested. Smilansky, M. et al.&#13;
(1966) established experimental afternoon and summer Enrichment Centers&#13;
(duration of program 3 years, ages 12-14) in Jerusalem and Tel-Aviv. The&#13;
follow-up report (1966, 1971) indicates that in comparison with a control&#13;
group, in both cities the experimental center groups demonstrated significant&#13;
gains on Wisc IQ, on scholastic retest batteries of the municipal psycholo-&#13;
gical services, on independent evaluation, and on the national scholastic&#13;
survey. Also, although support was terminated (according to design) at the&#13;
end of the 8th grade, the experimental groups (coming from 16 different&#13;
disadvantaged neighborhoods) demonstrated their continued superiority up to&#13;
completion of secondary school education (12th grade).&#13;
A parallel boarding home fostering program (Smilansky, H1. and Nevo,&#13;
1966, 1976) for the more gifted among the disadvantaged (mean Wisc IQ 100)&#13;
produced systematically promising results. The program fostered adolescents&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
from the ages of 14 to 17, during high school. The 10oyear follow-up showed&#13;
a significant superiority for the experimental groups in the rate of passing&#13;
matriculation examinations (in comparison with both the same ability and&#13;
background group and their secondary school classmates). And what is more&#13;
important, although the supportive program was terminated (according to&#13;
design) at the end of high school, and graduates went to serve for three&#13;
years in the army, they showed twice as many university graduates at the time&#13;
of follow-up (six years after termination of fostering) than the control&#13;
group0 Because of the success of the Boarding Home Program, the Ministry of&#13;
Education has gradually enlarged it and today more than 3,500 youth are&#13;
participating in 25 centers0&#13;
Frankenstein (1972) demonstrated with a similar ability and background&#13;
group the possibility of rehabilitating thought patterns, through systematic&#13;
help to teachers to perform such roles0 He achieved significant holding&#13;
power and success in national matriculation examinations although the project&#13;
was only a day program and not a total environment like a boarding home0&#13;
Special compensatory rehabilitation projects for the lower ability&#13;
groups among the disadvantaged are in operation, one in Jerusalem under the&#13;
leadership of Feurstein (1972), and a second in Tel-Aviv in the NETA Secondary&#13;
School Fostering Project (Smilansky, M. et al, 1977)o Feurstein is focusing&#13;
on systematic rehabilitation of cognitive abilities through specially con-&#13;
structed dynamic diagnosis and rehabilitation exercises, and there is evicence&#13;
of immediate positive impacto A longer range evaluation has been organized&#13;
and we await the results0 The NETA project is a more comprehensive curriculum&#13;
adaptation approach. Evaluation of some specific units is available but a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
comprehensive follow-up is planned. Both approaches are used now by the&#13;
Ministry of Education with adolescents in "depressed" areas and it plans a&#13;
follow-up evaluation.&#13;
Finally, cross-sectional achievement testing during the primary&#13;
grades and a follow-up during early adolescence by Levy and Chen (1974,&#13;
1976), like similar evidence by Law (1974) in California, also suggest the&#13;
possibility of arresting a "cumulative deficit" process through appropriate&#13;
investment.&#13;
The different studies on reversibility deserve a more detailed&#13;
evaluation, and some of the observations and experiments should be replicated&#13;
using a scientifically more careful and sophisticated design. But with all&#13;
possible reservations we should be aware of a promise in their basic proposi-&#13;
tion, that should be transformed into a new commitment to reforming secondary&#13;
education.&#13;
(c) Need assessment: Adolescent characteristics provide the foundation&#13;
for fostering programs. A promising fostering program should be based on need&#13;
assessment. But the question is what criteria are guiding us, as a value&#13;
orientation, in searching fo:- needs. For example, when we initiated the&#13;
NETA Secondary School Fostering Program for the low ability adolescent we&#13;
listed his present characteristics to guide curriculum unit developers to&#13;
start from where these persons are -- in their knowledge, skills, and motiva-&#13;
tions. And we attempted to define the normative expectations -- of the school&#13;
and society -- for psycho-socially mature adult behavior in our socio-cultural&#13;
system. But, in conceptualizing a reformation of adolescent education toward&#13;
the future, we chose a different approach -- a more dynamic one. We asked not&#13;
"where is our population?", but "where can it be?", according to need&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
assessment and our assumptions about their growth and change potentiality in&#13;
the context of. the local and national configuration of forces. There were&#13;
several reasons for this second, dynamic approach. First, we are dealing in&#13;
this report with conceptual futurism for building criteria of goal and task&#13;
orientation in developing educational programs for families and their chi].d-&#13;
ren0 Also, many of the present approaches to adolescent education are based&#13;
on static observations and interpretations. They perceive adolescents as they&#13;
are, in the context of present secondary schools, and may have no faith in our&#13;
capacity to effect change. Since we are aware how problematic it is to&#13;
facilitate long-range change in human beings and in social institutions, we&#13;
should start with a consideration of a promising dynamic perspective for an&#13;
effective environment and have faith in human capacity for development; and&#13;
only then ask how a bridge can be built between whprp -dolescents and their&#13;
social institutions are and their potential for growth and change0&#13;
There are at least 11 psycho-social characteristics, or potential&#13;
needs, of adolescents (Smilansky, M. and Sanders, 1972, 1974) that if per-&#13;
ceived and used by developers of education systems -- in goal definition,&#13;
organization, curriculum, social climate, and pattern of learning facilita-&#13;
tion -- can serve in a powerful intervention policy0 Such an approach to&#13;
program development may enable adolescents to be more rzsponsible partici-&#13;
pants, more active and creative, and more self-directive0 They are listed&#13;
next, and in the final section of this paper we outline propositions that&#13;
may provide the foundation for adolescent socialization based on these&#13;
characteristics.&#13;
We do want to repeat our reservation about the range and depth&#13;
of available knowledge, especially in what is defined as the non-cognitive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
domain. The limitations of research on psycho-social development beyond&#13;
early childhood should be recognized when we want to answer very basic&#13;
questions about relations between emotion and social development, cognition&#13;
and social or emotional development, etc. The limitations are even more&#13;
noticeable when we are interested in developmental changes with age, and&#13;
very little is known about the impact of different4il social4zation patterns&#13;
on the development of behavioral traits or competence. We assume that the&#13;
recognition of need dimensions in certain domains will also facilitate the&#13;
emergence of more relevant research.&#13;
(1) Marginality - As mentioned the adolescent is already not a child&#13;
but is also not an adult who has reached competency in knowledge, skills,&#13;
motivations, responsibilities, and status. And, as Mann (1965) said, he wants&#13;
to be an adult in some ways, but is reluctant to gi:ve up t'c   rivileges of&#13;
childhood all at once. Being at a crossroads he is in a position to change&#13;
orientations, and so to change roles, status, etc. His physical, emotional&#13;
and social capabilities are rapidly changing. Therefore relevant educational&#13;
experiences can promote the discovery of new options, orient the adolescent&#13;
toward continued consideration of desired values and behaviors, and help him&#13;
to accept responsibility for choice and performance in new directions. For&#13;
the disadvantaged, the limited available evidence (Amir, 1969; Feurstein,&#13;
et al, 1972; Frankenstein, 1972; Smilansky, M. and Nevo, 1977; Chen, et al,&#13;
1976; Dekel, 1976) shows the impact of a changed educational environment&#13;
during adolescence on motivation, school and army performance, self-esteem,&#13;
and responsibility.&#13;
(2) Potential awareness - The accelerated developmental change allows&#13;
an option for earlier development of awareness about self and the environment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
(the configurations of his parents, the socio-cultural setting, his early&#13;
experiences, expectations of the present and future, etc.). Appropriate&#13;
educational programs (for initial attempts see: Alschuller and Weinstein,&#13;
1974; Newberg, 1972; Smilansky, M. and Rosenman, 1977) aim to facilitate&#13;
change in self-perception and insight, as part of an attempt to foster self-&#13;
identity and social development. Experiences can be provided to enable&#13;
the individual to make more adequate differentiations of the phenomenal self&#13;
and its relation to external reality (Snygg and Coombs, 1949)o This di.ffer-&#13;
entiation is a foundation for the basic need of adolecents for independence&#13;
from parental dominance (Yosselson, 1975)o Awareness is achieved through a&#13;
complex process of perception, self-insight, and self-evaluation. Perceptual&#13;
differentiation is an initial psychological medium toward personal autonomy.&#13;
But to achieve awareness one needs also to reach a capacity for integration&#13;
of the many differentiated perceptions within his selfhood0 This is the&#13;
process of self-insight0 The adolescent needs to be able to confront his&#13;
past experiences, both real and imaginary, both those provided in the home&#13;
and those influenced by his community and national cultural heritage and&#13;
current events0 He needs to differentiate cause and effect, basic trait&#13;
and symptom, fact and interpretation, to understand a pattern and cope with&#13;
it.  This is already another state in awareness building -- self=evaluation0&#13;
Self-evaluation -- of potentialities as well as limitations -- is a prere-&#13;
quisite for conscious self-acceptance, at least to a certain degree0 Lt may&#13;
bring a change in the perception of others (Cowan, 1942); the adolescent may&#13;
begin to take actual responsibility for more confident self-determination,&#13;
self-development, and social development0 In other words, the systematically&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
fostered capacity for awareness, enhanced in adolescence by cognitive and&#13;
moral maturity, allows autonomy and responsibility for choices relating to the&#13;
future.&#13;
(3) Differentiation - Adolescence is an age of accelerated differen-&#13;
tiations in the tempo and mode of growth and development, according to age,&#13;
sex, abilities, knowledge, aptitude&lt;,   ^tiatÂ±0ns, and patterns of coping.&#13;
These differences are influenced by both hereditary and environmental fac-&#13;
tors. They can be perceived and realized -- by parents, teachers, and the&#13;
adolescent -- as positive potentialities, if they are approached positively,&#13;
legitimized, and fostered rather than denied by static evaluation of the&#13;
individual against a fixed stereotype.&#13;
(4) Cognitive maturity - If we use the Inhelder and Piaget (1958)&#13;
definiti4ns of stages, adolescence is a..     vf transformation toward capacity&#13;
for "formal operations" in cognitive development. Those helped to master&#13;
their potentiality find new worlds open to them. They can cognitively master&#13;
the place of man and social institutions within different dimensions of time,&#13;
space, and mode of operation. Therefore, for them experience is not the only&#13;
possible reality.&#13;
Fostering cognitive development is a basic priority in societies&#13;
in an duvdaLLed stage of technologicai, urban, and secular modernism because&#13;
on it is dependent a person's capacity to perceive, gain insight, and under-&#13;
stand self, environment, and his interdependent transformations. While&#13;
originally psychological assumptions focused on mental health fostering to&#13;
promote capacity for cognitive development, later evaluations provide evi-&#13;
dence of how inability to cope with cognitive expectations undermine mental&#13;
health in general and emotional expression in particular (Frankenstein, 1972;&#13;
Smilansky, S., 1958; Hoffman, 1975). AUz-, .,gnitive ability development is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
important for social development both in terms of social conceptualization&#13;
and moral decisionmaking. Different social learning theories are associated&#13;
with different degrees of cognitive development.&#13;
Even those who question the universality of Piaget's timing of&#13;
transformation (on the basis of tests in different socio-cultural ecologies)&#13;
or his social-psychological interpretations, are not questioning the impor-&#13;
tant role of cognitive development in gaining the necessary social perspec-&#13;
tive in a world of accelerated change and complexity, with interdependence&#13;
among elements in the systematic configuration of forces.&#13;
(5) Search for self-identity - Adolescence is an age of feeling, social&#13;
search, and commitment. We discussed some aspects of the need for self-per-&#13;
ception, self-understanding, and self-evaluation -- through different media&#13;
-- in comparison with significant others who serve as a frame of reference.&#13;
But there is more involved. It is the need to develop the necessary autonomy&#13;
for personhood. Although self-knowledge is an important foundation, the next&#13;
step is differentiation from parental attachment and domination and develop-&#13;
ment of a societal pattern of role-expectation, feeling, and reacting (which&#13;
is sometimes even expressed in terms of being an object instead of a subject)0&#13;
Roles must be clarified0 Unlike the abrupt transformation from child attach-&#13;
ment into identity in adulthood in "primitive" societies through "rites de&#13;
passage," in the complexity of modernization a prolonged option for a process&#13;
of transformation is available. Erickson (1959) defined it as the "psycholo-&#13;
gical moratorium"0 Educational programs can utilize this moratorium to help&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
adolescents understand their family of origin and their cultural heritage,&#13;
identify the potentialities in their self and in different environments, build&#13;
awareness about who they are and what they can be and want to be, and facili-&#13;
tate learning to take advantage of possible options. These programs may&#13;
develop persons who are more secure in their identity, more active and com-&#13;
micced, instead of passive and alienaceu.&#13;
(6) Social development - Empirical knowledge in this domain is very&#13;
limited, although there are many hypotheses from personality theories that&#13;
should be tested longitudinally through specification and replication in&#13;
different ecological contexts.&#13;
To reach an appropriate level of psycho-social competence in roles&#13;
in school, peer group, heterosexual intimacy, work place, family building,&#13;
etc., the growing adolescent must develop interpersonai ana soclai competence&#13;
in feeling, valuing, communication, and social integration. While this was&#13;
important to a certain degree in traditional society, it became a dominant&#13;
need in fragmented, competitive, mobility-oriented, role-changing, and&#13;
socially interdependent ecological contexts. Because of inner biological&#13;
and rapid psychological changes, and the need for reorientation to new equi-&#13;
librium, adolescence in our society is characterized by self-centeredness,&#13;
"inward-bound" focusing. This may have positive potentiality for self-aware-&#13;
ness and self-identity, but it may also have negative aspects, for example,&#13;
in terms of being inconsiderate of the needs of others -- it is a lag in&#13;
capacity for empathy, social commitment, responsibility, etc. There are&#13;
different ways to differentiate and discuss areas of necessary social com-&#13;
petence. Here we shall focus only on illustrations from some areas of&#13;
communication and action that have crucial potentiality in adolescence.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
The first illustration is social communication. According to Berlo&#13;
(1960) it depends not only on knowledge level and verbal facility but also&#13;
on the person's attitude and the expectation of the socio-cultural system.&#13;
Social development should aim at what he defines as the fourth (upper) level,&#13;
two-sided mutuality9 where both communicators participate in role-taking and&#13;
influence-making0&#13;
The philosopher Buber defined this achievement as a capacity for&#13;
dialog (instead of duolog, where each person sends crossing, unrelated mes-&#13;
sages). Of course9 such a level of communication assumes a capacity f:or what&#13;
Erickson (1959, po 82) defined as "equality of worth," even where there is no&#13;
"equality of time schedules," as in the case of the father-son relation0&#13;
The second illustration is empathy, the capacity for openness, per-&#13;
ception, insight, feeiing, tolerance, sympaEhy, and concern for che "other"&#13;
in general and to the partner in interaction (communication) in particular.&#13;
Hoffman (1975) suggested that there are three stages in the development of&#13;
empathy from infancy up to nine years, which are related to cognitive devel-&#13;
opment stages0 An extension of research, both in terms of later develop-&#13;
mental stages and differentielly to define the impact of sex roles, social&#13;
class, cultural context, impact, etc., is needed0&#13;
A third example is expressed in what is called friendship, a&#13;
concept embracing the whole gamut of recognition of need and capacity for&#13;
give-and-take relationships between persons0 It ranges from the capacity for&#13;
mutuality in any form of interdependent social relations to what is defined&#13;
as "love"0 Some persons are unable emotionally to give help, but can take&#13;
the given, and even expect it0 Others don't know how to ask for support0&#13;
For some, to "give" is to give on their own terms, according to their needs,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
rather than on the other partner's needs. This capacity is necessary for the&#13;
development of mutually satisfying social relations in any context and is&#13;
crucial to modern family life, which is based on a "love" model. Thus,&#13;
we see sex education for adolescents in the context of sex-role identity and&#13;
anticipatory socialization toward family building. Our curriculum development&#13;
wor'k for socialization in this area aims to develop capacity for effective,&#13;
mutually satisfying give-and-take social development in heterosexual rela-&#13;
tions.&#13;
Another aspect of special importance is social relations in general.&#13;
It is the capacity to develop and maintain necessary and satisfying human&#13;
relations, both with persons of the same sex and with members of the other&#13;
sex. While some are unable even to reach minimal normative standards of com-&#13;
munication, others reach the desired stage of response enjoyment and satis-&#13;
faction, based on trust, expression, and release of feelings, through autonomy&#13;
and spontaneity - almost natural interdependence. Personality research not&#13;
only demonstrates individual differences in this domain but even suggests&#13;
possible hereditary traits, for both the constraints and the creative capa-&#13;
bilities that some persons demonstrate.&#13;
The fact that even common (as if equal) socialization, from birth&#13;
until adulthood, in communal settlements (like the kibbutz) does not diminish&#13;
the great individual differences both in)the need and capacity for social&#13;
intercourse demonstrates how deep-seated these traits are.&#13;
But, there is also evidence from human relations training and dif-&#13;
ferent forms of therapy that some degree of change is possible, whether in-&#13;
depth transformation or only skill development for symptom control. What is&#13;
important for our discussion is that recent initiatives to introduce direct&#13;
intervention in this domain, in early and late adolescent educacion, suggest&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
both a recognition of the need and a readiness for self-development in this&#13;
domain.&#13;
(7) Noral development and political commitment     We could discuss&#13;
these characteristics separately since each has unique developmental foster-&#13;
ing potentiality during adolescence (Kohlberg and Turiel, 1972; Adelsoia,&#13;
1971)o But it was decided to associate them here because of our conviction&#13;
that in a discussion of education by need assessment it is important to&#13;
communicate that a democratic society needs both political commitment of the&#13;
young and political action that is morally based and not just an expression&#13;
of personal and group selfish interest. In both domains there is relatively&#13;
limited comparative and longitudinal in-depth research on the "natural" social&#13;
psychological reality and the impact of different forms of intervention&#13;
(Adkins, et al, 1974; Turiel, 1975).&#13;
Since Adelson's comparative and partly longitudinal analysis (1972,&#13;
based on a series of Ph.D. dissertations 1966=1970) is one of the more&#13;
reliable sources, his statements are relevant for our presentation. First,&#13;
he states (po 106):&#13;
"the years of adolescence9 twelve to sixteen9 are a&#13;
watershed era in the emergence of political thoughto&#13;
Ordinarily the youngster begins adolescence incapable&#13;
of complex political discourse - that is, mute on many&#13;
issues, and when not mute, then simplistic, primitive,&#13;
subject to fancies, unable to enter fully the realm of&#13;
political ideas. By the time this period is at an end,&#13;
a dramatic change is evident, the youngster's grasp of&#13;
the political world is now recognizably adulto"&#13;
Secondly, he points out that age growth in intellectual abstraction&#13;
and moral judgment are the dominant factors in the growth of political con-&#13;
cepts, while sex, intelligence, social class, and ethnic variability are only&#13;
secondaryo As he demonstrates, this growth is expressed in the quality of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
thought, time perspective, motivation, knowledge, modes of reasoning, the&#13;
decline of authoritarianism, etc.&#13;
Third, while cognitive development is a generalized and promising&#13;
phenomenon, the affective ideological involvement and the active commitment&#13;
is a privilege of a minority. This is an illustration of the impact of&#13;
personality factors, family background, and cultural -l4ieu that leads to&#13;
social underdevelopment and suggests a clear need for systematic educational&#13;
intervention by those who want to assume specific value-oriented citizenship&#13;
education.&#13;
Fourth, the depth of need is demonstrated by a comparison. The&#13;
sustained effects of what is called the German authoritarian paternalistic&#13;
character -- after a quarter of a century experience of democratic political&#13;
domination, with continuous economic and CUILULd4 rewards -- should be con-&#13;
sidered as an added illustration of how serious is the challenge for anticipa-&#13;
tory socialization toward democratic values during adolescence, the last&#13;
optional period for compulsory social intervention education.&#13;
Kohlberg made an important contribution (1972) with his proposed&#13;
moral development stages, as an extension of Piaget's cognitive stage trans-&#13;
formation during adolescence. As Kohlberg states (p. 165):&#13;
"The shift in adolescence from concrete to formal opera-&#13;
tions, the ability now to see the given as only a subset&#13;
of the possible and to spin out the alternatives, consti-&#13;
tutes the necessary pre-condition for the transition from&#13;
conventional to principled moral reasoning."&#13;
It is in adolescence, then, that the child has the cognitive capability to&#13;
move from a conventional to a postconventional, reflective, or philosophic&#13;
view of values and society. The rejection of conventional moral reasoning&#13;
begins with the perception of relativism; the awareness that any given&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 &#13;
society's definition of right and wrong, however legitimate, is only one&#13;
among many, both in fact and theory. Kohlberg's contribution extends a:Lso&#13;
into the implication for education, with a demonstration (Kohlberg and&#13;
Blatt, 1972) of an option to "induce considerable upward stage movement in&#13;
thought."' Similar attempts by others using different intervention media&#13;
should serve co give new meaning to the pocencial promise of the political&#13;
decision toward qualitative democratization of secondary education. To this&#13;
we would add that the experience of educators and politically involved&#13;
practitioners - in all shades of the ideological spectrum and in different&#13;
societies -- seems to demonstrate the options for development in this realm.&#13;
The best examples that we know from field situations are the ideological&#13;
"youth movements," originally initiated in Europe and later spread through&#13;
the initiation of political parties in different countries of the world0&#13;
So, from both the theoretical conceptualization and experience, it&#13;
is suggested that in terms of immediate involvement and long-range impact this&#13;
is a crucial stage0 An effective learning environment should lay the founda=&#13;
tion for involvement in moral issues (personal, family, community, nation,&#13;
and world affairs), social integration (in friendship, family, and community)9&#13;
and political action0 Self-identity, family integrity, community cultural&#13;
development, and the whole meaning of the options of modernization -- f:or&#13;
the individual, the group, and society at large -- may depend on systematic&#13;
fostering in these domains0&#13;
(8) Peer influence - Our description of the fragmentation of soci.al&#13;
institutions, the marginality and ambiguity of adolescents' role and status,&#13;
and their need for affiliation, status, communication, and intimacy may ex-&#13;
plain the basic need of adolescents for peer association. In our discussion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
of social education we raised some of the research issues. Here we add that&#13;
peers may serve to provide the necessary awareness, empathy, security, shar-&#13;
ing, and actual support for autonomy in coping and problem-solving. But&#13;
they also may serve as a medium for competition, lowered self-esteem, and even&#13;
forced incapacity for social integration. In the design and development of&#13;
educational and social programs. acoiescent peer groups can be utilized as&#13;
reference and support groups -- systematically and flexibly, for different&#13;
objectives and according to different models -- for social learning inter-&#13;
action, heterosexual social development, emotional support, mutual problem-&#13;
solving, tutoring, community improvement, etc. Peer organization should not&#13;
mean the standard classroom age-cohort, but a fostering of different compo-&#13;
sitions for association in a community. The social aim of peer association&#13;
intervention should be to promote readiness to share in mutual responsibility&#13;
for self-development and improved quality of life in a significant ecological&#13;
setting.&#13;
(9) Family involvement - In the discussion of parent-adolescent ambi-&#13;
guity of feeling and relations we raised the need for support. Our experi-&#13;
ence in developing curriculum programs for parent-adolescent communication&#13;
suggests that there is a need and potential readiness for confrontation by&#13;
both sides. The modular units in this program focused on three central&#13;
themes: parent understanding of adolescence, parent understanding of the&#13;
institution of secondary education and its impact on the adolescent, and the&#13;
promotion of dialog between parents and adolescents. Such dialogs aim to&#13;
facilitate mutual awareness of needs and search for improved options to&#13;
produce improved quality of life in the family and better growth potential.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46&#13;
There is need for additional approaches to education in this domain and a more&#13;
systematic evaluation of both the process and its impact.&#13;
(10) Crisis orientation - Even from our limited discussion of issues and&#13;
problems, one could anticipate that adolescence can be a period of tension&#13;
and crisis especially in this stage of modernization of family and society.&#13;
But there is evidence about adolescents for whom crisis is not the exp,erience0&#13;
Our assumption is that to actualize the potentiality of adolescence we should&#13;
value, foster, and capitalize on the crisi9 proposition. The extent to&#13;
which the adolescent will be able to confront reality, develop new insights,&#13;
and define personal commitments will depend on his initiation into crisis and&#13;
the support that will be available during the process of "positive disorganiza-&#13;
tion." A fostering program for adolescent learning should take responsibil-&#13;
ity to ferment the crisis -- buildUibg awareness and coping capacity through&#13;
facilitation of a differentiation process of self in the context of ernviron-&#13;
ments -- to secure the adolescent's moral conscious and unconscious autonomy&#13;
in relation to his family and community of origin. The "psychologicaL&#13;
moratorium" is available to ferment the crisis. But the problem is that most&#13;
adolescent socializing agencies assume -- explicitly or implicitly - that&#13;
the available period is positive if the rating of adjustment by teach-ers and&#13;
parents is "no problems," while we assume that crisis experience is necessary&#13;
for psycho-social maturity.&#13;
(11) Responsibility - The first stage of liberalism and democratization&#13;
of a social, political, and economic system is the awareness about the needs&#13;
of disadvantaged groups for rights. So it is only natural that with the&#13;
development of modernism, pressure for basic rights of oppressed groups is&#13;
dominant. Since "man" (male) was a dominant person and "work" a dominant&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
need, male-worker rights dominated the initial stage of modernization. Then&#13;
came the demand for "minority" rights -- national minorities, religious&#13;
minorities, ethnic minorities, women, and youth. Here is not the place to&#13;
discuss the order of events among groups, and for each group, and their&#13;
consequences. For our discussion it is important.to recognize that the quest&#13;
for rights -- with all its justified and positive manifestations, raised for&#13;
the future a new and parallel issue -- that of responsibility. While we&#13;
should continue the confrontation with the need for rights, we should face&#13;
also the need for responsibility. We assume that adolescents and youth (like&#13;
these other groups) have the need for autonomy and so the need and capacity&#13;
to be responsible for their performance. In the same way that they may be&#13;
role-playing as egocentric, unresponsive, and irresponsible, they have the&#13;
physical, cognitive, moral, and emotional potentiality for shared responsi-&#13;
bility. They can be partners in their own crisis reorientation, share in&#13;
the co-determination of institutional development toward self-renewal, and&#13;
demonstrate their responsibility toward persons and social issues. If we see&#13;
them as unresponsive and irresponsible it is because societies and families&#13;
in the process of modernization forced on adolescents roles, position, status,&#13;
and power that lead to such reaction.&#13;
From the experience of ideological youth organizations, underground&#13;
political groups, communal enterprises, successful schools, and many families&#13;
who fostered confrontation with responsibility, we can conceptualize that a&#13;
learning environment seeking shared accomplishment (through co-determination&#13;
in participatory democracy and commitment to crucial task-accomplishment)&#13;
will produce youth with responsibility. We are proposing the development&#13;
of experimenting schools that will test this basic proposition with a more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
systematic, comparative, and longitudinal approach in the context of dif-&#13;
ferential socio-cultural environments (Sanders, Smilansky, Ho, and Soffianos,&#13;
1975)0&#13;
But to test this proposition we should recognize the dominant&#13;
impact of appropriate leaders who must serve as models for identification&#13;
and a frame of reference for teachers, adolescents, and parents. In a&#13;
four-year experiment (Smilansky, H0 and Nevo, D., 1966) for the development&#13;
of an adolescent fostering boarding home program we realized how four dif-&#13;
ferent program directors transformed the above-mentioned characteristics of&#13;
adolescents of the same ethnic and social group0&#13;
III0 Effective Environments for Adolescent Education&#13;
Because of space limitation we shall be able only to list some&#13;
of our basic assumptions and propositions. The preceding discussion of&#13;
adolescent need assessment and our general approach to educational reform&#13;
should serve to broaden the meaning behind some of the short statements0&#13;
Only a search for better ways of need assessment and the creation, through&#13;
a process of experimenting, of more effective environments for socializa-&#13;
tion from childhood to adulthood may contribute to a better awareness of&#13;
the ambiguities involved-andthe need actualization of all concerned.&#13;
There is no school, or other social institution, that can be&#13;
adapted to the needs of all adolescents and youth; no single framework that&#13;
can serve even one adolescent for actualizing all his needs; and no one best&#13;
method for teaching or socializing toward psycho-social maturity in the&#13;
cognitive, emotional, and social domain0 But there is a need and an option&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
for an experimental proposition. We have initiated preliminary work in&#13;
conceptualizing development of experimenting schools (Smilansky, M.,&#13;
Sanders, and Coleman, 1973; Sanders, Smilansky, M., and Sofianos, 1974)&#13;
and in the preparation of curriculum modules on self-identity, family build-&#13;
ing, and urbanism (Smilansky, M., et al., 1977). This work needs interna-&#13;
ciona. cooperation and longitudinal and comparative evaluation so it may&#13;
be adapted to different socio-cultural settings.&#13;
(a) School as an independent entity.&#13;
We perceive school as a social organism which must be rooted firmly&#13;
in the needs and expectations of its students and community if it is to live&#13;
and grow. It must be a responsible association for learning -- meaningful&#13;
and valuable to the persons in the ecological context it serves. Those&#13;
associated in the development of the school -- teachers, students, parents --&#13;
should feel that this is their school, for which they share responsibility,&#13;
and must perform according to criteria of accountability.&#13;
This interpretation of the school's role is basic to our value&#13;
orientation about adolescent education because in this socialization institu-&#13;
tion adolescents should be able to perceive a model of participatory demo-&#13;
cracy, a frame of reference for their value orientation, and a field exper-&#13;
ience for the development- of personal autonomy, social relations, and commu-&#13;
nity interpretation. This assumption&#13;
leads to the proposition that a school be limited in the number of partici-&#13;
pants (hundreds and not thousands, and even those sub-grouped into semi-&#13;
autonomous mini-schools) and be managed cooperatively through co-determined,&#13;
shared responsibility by students as well as teachers. In other words a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
school for adolescents should be a micro-system of an active, open, experi-&#13;
menting, democratic community (see Smilansky, M0 and Sanders, 1972)o&#13;
This is important for adolescent education becaus: adolescents&#13;
need both autonomy for experimenting and security in the expected crisis&#13;
developing in the process. The option for dialog in communication, insight,&#13;
empathy, and personal responsibility must be available even to those limited&#13;
in cognitive and social development. The standard large-scale secondary&#13;
schools fail because they are bureaucratic and impersonal and provide a bad&#13;
experience as to the meaning of democracy and community; the alternative "free&#13;
schools" generally fail because of their incapacity to survive crisis,&#13;
inexperienced personnel, economic and social pressures, and lack of con-&#13;
tinuity.&#13;
(b) The school as an associate member.&#13;
A school's autonomy will be based on basic security and trust&#13;
achieved through cooperation in asociation with other schools and with the&#13;
necessary support provided by a regional support system. As a member unit of&#13;
a cooperative association for the development of adolescent education, each&#13;
school -- and its members (administrators, teachers, students) -- will be open&#13;
for continuous communication with, and responsible questioning by, interested&#13;
and competent others engaged seriously and systematically in the same quest0&#13;
Its team members will have an opportunity for reflecting on the experience of&#13;
others and giving help to them as well as receiving it.&#13;
(c) The school as an experimenting institution0&#13;
As stated, we believe that schools, as presently designed and&#13;
operated, are no longer adequate for socialization in an urban, industrial,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
democratic, and secular society. They are not adequate to the task either&#13;
from the point of view of society as a whole or from the point of view of&#13;
adolescents who should learn how to live satisfying lives in a society of&#13;
persistent and sometimes irreversible change. It is our asumption that&#13;
no single type of school will be appropriate for all adolescents, but all&#13;
adolescents should have access to an appropriate school, given their indi-&#13;
vidual needs and the socio-cultural configuration of their community. The&#13;
answer is in how we define "school as an experimenting proposition".&#13;
Since adolescence is a marginal stage -- with a need to search&#13;
for identity and the development of a personal way to achieve psycho-social&#13;
maturity and social integration -- the "experimenting" proposition is most&#13;
appropriate. It may facilitate learning by persons to accommodate&#13;
changes flexibly and share in the generation of ecological systems in ac-&#13;
cordance with their value-oriented needs.&#13;
(d) The school as a person-oriented institution.&#13;
The accelerated modernization process places heavy obligations on&#13;
human personalities, particularly for persons from culturally disadvantaged&#13;
groups. The individual must learn to accept personal responsibility in&#13;
unprecedented form for active, self-directive participation in a rapidly&#13;
changing and increasingly complex social environment. Responsibility for&#13;
protecting personality and developing individual integrity is upon the indi-&#13;
vidual alone or upon the individual with the support of a family in a process&#13;
of adaptation to changing expectations. Only the prepared, well-equipped,&#13;
secure, self-directive, autonomous, and socially responsible person --&#13;
competent to cooperate with others able to support him -- can cope success-&#13;
fully under these conditions. An adolescent student who perceives teachers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
and students accepted and treated as "persons" and not as "objects" (in a&#13;
bureaucratic network) will be socialized toward such an orientation as family&#13;
builder and citizen.&#13;
The three negative adolescent behavior manifestations -- sexual&#13;
waywardness, estrangement from family responsibility, and non-involvement in&#13;
community heritage and development -- may have a common core. In traditional&#13;
societies there was no "personhood01' A child was valued according to his&#13;
future value in extending the power of the extended family, the tribe, etco&#13;
A girl/woman was valued for her capacity to enhance the needs of her father,&#13;
husband, and extended family. And a man was valued according to his power&#13;
(in working, fighting, producing children, manipulating the environment: etc.).&#13;
ReliRious institutions served well for thousands of vears, because they&#13;
sanctioned the power structure by an all embracing god who ordered the uni-&#13;
verse according to unquestionable needs for "law and order." The totalitarian&#13;
regimes, with all their diversity, are actually attempting to role-play&#13;
according to a similar prerogative of taking power from persons to systems in&#13;
the name of the great idea of their leadership0&#13;
While the first stage of the modernization process produced the&#13;
neeative aspects of fragmentation we discussed. it facilitated the sea.rch&#13;
for a new element of integration -- a person0 Education for personhood may&#13;
facilitate a new era of social integration     the free choice commitment&#13;
to family, community, and ethnic or national heritage, not to serve as an&#13;
extension of intergenerational power but to actualize a need for personhood,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
empathy, affiliation, and social intercourse in a community of sharing,&#13;
mutual enrichment, and improvement of the quality of life.&#13;
(e) School as a cognitively oriented but affectively based system.&#13;
Modernization is a complex, comprehensive, dynamic transformation&#13;
process. It is based on science, technology, space and time reduction,&#13;
national and international interdependence, urbanism, secularism, bureaucracy,&#13;
and accelerated change. Those who don't want to be culturally disadvantaged&#13;
should develop the capacity for cognitively oriented performance. At the&#13;
same time, institutional fragmentation, large bureaucratic organizations,&#13;
expanded options, meritocracy, competition, cultural changes, extended family&#13;
fragmentation, etc., produce daily pressure on personal, mental, and even&#13;
physical health. There are feelings of anxiety, loneliness, and incapacity&#13;
to cope with the emerging insecurity and crisis potentialities. So there&#13;
is a need for systematic fostering attempts to secure an affective base for&#13;
cultivation of personal-psychological trust, security, and autonomy. Inter-&#13;
vention for us is a nourishment of the transaction capacity between persons.&#13;
An environment to promote learning toward aims which are deemed worthwhile&#13;
should be developed. Since adolescence is a stage for transformation toward&#13;
higher levels of cognitive, moral, and affective competence (we illustrated&#13;
their interdependence in our discussion of need assessment), a fostering&#13;
social-psychological environment for adolescents should consider the cog-&#13;
nitive and affective domains as different dimensions in an inseparable&#13;
configuration of human forces. These assumptions have implications for&#13;
institutional education practices. Some implications are: mutual respon-&#13;
sibility of staff and students for fostering a genuine and person-oriented&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
learning environment; guarantee of educational access through mutually&#13;
accepted responsibilities in a helping relationship (peer tutoring, peer&#13;
counselling, teacher-student and student-parent task-oriented teams, social&#13;
organization according to subject-matter or problem-oriented modular courses,&#13;
etc.); focus on self-identity9 anticipatory socialization toward family&#13;
building and urbanism; systematic confrontation with social problems in&#13;
general and those in the context of community ecology in particular; and&#13;
dynamic diagnosis as a new evaluation patterno&#13;
(f) School as a helping and extended system.&#13;
Schools should be developed as a social arrangement for helping&#13;
adolescents to learn to be in charge of their own lives and to promote their&#13;
integration with the life of the communityo Being in charge of one's own&#13;
life implies the following capacities: to be aware of oneself and the&#13;
environment9 to understand something and be understanding of somebody, and&#13;
to engage in the environment in the sense of transacting with it and choosing&#13;
with regard to it. Thus the experimenting school for adolescents may be&#13;
viewed as a helping system, because it is an adolescent-centered social&#13;
arrangement that facilitates learning and cultivates the capacities of its&#13;
participants. It can be defined as an extended system because it int:egrates&#13;
students with the life of the community.&#13;
The assumption underlying such an integration is that school is&#13;
not just a building, a closed system of professional teachers and adolescents.&#13;
Adolescents need a variety of experiences for learning self-development and&#13;
coping with the reality of life. The present secondary school is unable to&#13;
fulfill adolescent needs. The answer is not a retreat to the days when&#13;
"common man" adolescents were sent to work in apprenticeships--because the&#13;
O&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
factory, office, and store are even more boring and educationally limited than&#13;
the present secondary schools' (Driben, 1974). The failure of the Russian&#13;
School Reform initiated by Xhruschev in 1959 and a work program in a boarding&#13;
youth village in Israel (Smilansky, M. and Nevo, 1972) should be considered.&#13;
Instead we suggest that the school should be a base for an open social sys-&#13;
tem. It will collaborate with other social agencies in preparing adolescents&#13;
for living in modernizing societies. Since experiences outside the class-&#13;
room are important potential vehicles for learning, institutional settings&#13;
and potential opportunities in the community must be arranged to serve as&#13;
learning environments.&#13;
Supportive staff (partially paid and partially volunteers) of&#13;
parents and community members should be associated with school personnel.&#13;
Some staff enrichment will develop because students must gain experience in&#13;
the world of work, child care, and function of social service institutions&#13;
and must give services to their community in a systematic way.&#13;
Students should become able to observe and practice adult roles&#13;
and activities in a diversity of circumstances. In an agrarian society this&#13;
was achieved naturally because of involvement within an extended family,&#13;
integration of residence and work place, child labor, limited work roles,&#13;
and mostly their primitive nature (consistency of sex roles, etc). Today&#13;
it can be achieved through school-community interchange and cooperation,&#13;
in ways that can be designed through evaluation of available options in&#13;
different countries.&#13;
(g) Work experience, technological education, and vocational training&#13;
In our discussion of the need to enrich the meaning of adolescent&#13;
socialization, we assumed that different forms of work experience should&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
have positive impact, in helping adolescents to confront the meaning of work&#13;
as a basic social role, to understand career options, and to serve the need&#13;
of community involvement and social integration. Technological education is&#13;
a different proposition -- explained in terms of the need of adolescents in&#13;
industrialized society to understand technology and to perceive its applica-&#13;
tion through both their science courses and social studies. But that. is&#13;
not the focus of this discussion. Here wa want to suggest that for some&#13;
youth there is a positive option in early entrance into vocational technical&#13;
education. There are three reasons why vocational-technical education was&#13;
degraded and neglected in many Western democracies mainly after World War II.&#13;
First was the aspiration toward a common secondary school which originated in&#13;
the U.S. during the 30's as part of the New Deal and the progressive education&#13;
era. It appeared in England in the form of a "Vcomprehensive school" as a&#13;
labor party initiative against an early selective system that maintained&#13;
the continuation of a socially stratified school and society, then spread in&#13;
the 50's to Scandinavia and other countries, first in the most comprehensive&#13;
school reform of Sweden, then in France, and later in Israel and other coun-&#13;
tries. Second, persons in industry, economists, and educators assumed thlat&#13;
the accelerated phase of technological innovation made vocational schools&#13;
(curriculum, equipment, and instructors) obsolete, and for economic progress&#13;
schools should be limited to laying foundations in cognitive development,&#13;
basic skills, and social adjustment with vocational training left tc the place&#13;
of production. And third, the prolongation of schooling postponed trhe voca-&#13;
tional training programs to the post-secondary period, junior college--     L:,&#13;
U.S. and technical colleges of different forms in England and similar places.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
While we recognize the reasoning behind this trend it seems to&#13;
us that for some adolescents in all societies, and for most adolescents in&#13;
developing countries, early vocational training should be preferred. In&#13;
Israel, during the 60's, it was decided to give priority to the development&#13;
of vocational-technical education, by reorganizing the curriculum, providing&#13;
a new differentiation in the available programs, opening the way toward&#13;
higher education to technical school graduates, and so changing the status&#13;
of vocational education and allocating larger resources for both school&#13;
improvement and student support.&#13;
The technical school has the distinct advantage of providing an&#13;
opportunity to its candidates to adjust and progress for the following&#13;
reasons (Smilansky, M., 1974):&#13;
a) It includes a practical work program, where the youth can&#13;
see the relationship between the theoretical hypotheses&#13;
and assumptions and their applicability in the field.&#13;
Therefore, those who do not come from an intellectually&#13;
stimulating environment and have not reached the stage of&#13;
"formal operational thinking" will enjoy learning and will&#13;
progress further in this type of learning system.&#13;
b) The program is directed at defined occupations. Therefore,&#13;
those who do not come from the middle class and are not&#13;
ready to postpone immediate gratification for more distant&#13;
and general aims will be able to see a reason for learning&#13;
in this framework and will pursue their studies.&#13;
c) The program is varied and has many rewarding opportunities,&#13;
at least during part of the day, even for those who do not&#13;
show readiness to attend and persevere.&#13;
d) The program is graded and can offer the pupil a constant&#13;
reading of his adjustment and progress. It provides&#13;
him with immediate reinforcement, which is vital to the&#13;
adolescent who is a first-generation literate.&#13;
e) The program is different for different occupations and&#13;
levels. Therefore, it allows immediate application and&#13;
advanced channeling according to the different levels of&#13;
achievement, ability, and aptitudes, without harming the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 _&#13;
feeling of achievement and giving the opportunity to every&#13;
one to attain a certain degree of success.&#13;
f) Since the average ability of most of the pupils is lower,&#13;
it is possible to maintain within this framewor' the&#13;
feeling of achievement and progress -- even in the initial&#13;
stages of adjustment0&#13;
g) The program socializes toward an occupation and does not&#13;
lead only to another stage of learning, as academic high&#13;
schools do. This is very important for those who come&#13;
from poor families where often the head of the family&#13;
ages early and stops working0 During a family crisis a&#13;
youth who has completed a technical high school program&#13;
can support the family either partially or totally0&#13;
Although there are many advantages to the technical high school,&#13;
there are also limitations. WH must be aware of the following developmnents:&#13;
a) The vocational school might lower the aspiration level of&#13;
the pupils and their parents because the youth can complete&#13;
his studies and learn an occupation in a shorter time and&#13;
with less intellectual effort. For example, a pupil in a&#13;
technical school who does not progress as he should in a&#13;
high standard electronics course is directed to an easier&#13;
and shorter program0 while he knows that if he were in an&#13;
academic school, without intellectual effort he would be&#13;
suspended from school0&#13;
b) Attending a vocational school might bar entry into certain&#13;
occupations0 By early specialization, the youth has lim-&#13;
ited his horizons -- at a stage before "formal thinking"&#13;
and before he has the ability 6to see things in broader&#13;
perspective0&#13;
c) The vocational school's practical work is time-consuming0&#13;
Therefore it limits the pupil's opportunity for intellec-&#13;
tual and social development.&#13;
d) The vocational school will accustom its pupils to a&#13;
social environment where the value patterns and behavior&#13;
are like those of workers or technicians -- while at&#13;
least some of the pupils are capable of striving for&#13;
further academic studies to perform on a higher intel-&#13;
lectual level0&#13;
These positive and negative possibilities indicate the need to&#13;
create learning opportunities in various types of institutions, to determine&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
carefully criteria for student selection among the available opportunities,&#13;
and to establish additional opportunities beyond those in the individual&#13;
institutions by providing free transfer options between different institu-&#13;
tions, by diagnosing pupils' condition, and by providing constant counselling&#13;
and guidance.&#13;
The success of the Israeli attempt to d-AV=rs,'f; .echnical educati_O&#13;
was beyond expectations. Although there are many limitations in the programs&#13;
developed, the number of students in vocational-technical education doubled&#13;
during Israel's five year plan. Today more than half of Israeli secondary&#13;
education students are in vocational education (technical-industrial, agri-&#13;
cultural, and maritime), and more than 60 percent of them are from socially&#13;
disadvantaged backgrounds. A recommendation of the Israeli long-range plan-&#13;
ning task force (Peled, et aL., June 1976) was Lo increase che proportion of&#13;
those in the different forms of vocational-technical education up to two-&#13;
thirds of all secondary school students, assuming that this will be achieved&#13;
mainly by absorbing into the mainstream of secondary schooling most of those&#13;
who are currently dropouts.&#13;
This decision should not be accepted as an ideal choice in disre-&#13;
gard of the above discussed negative aspects of early vocational schooling.&#13;
It is only a realization that under the present conditions of social readi-&#13;
ness and school readiness for change, this is one option to give an oppor-&#13;
tunity to a large segment of the population to become socially integrated and&#13;
economically assured citizens during the coming decade. This basic decision&#13;
should also be considered along with the propositions to further improve the&#13;
quality of secondary technical education previously discussed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
(h) A boarding-out option&#13;
There are both adolescents and families who for different reasons&#13;
need for their self-actualization the option of separation during at least&#13;
part of the secondary education period. Boarding-out options (in boarding&#13;
schools, boarding homes, and other facilities) were historically available&#13;
in different societies, mainly for the upper classes who were able to afford&#13;
it, but also for others. Boarding-out education was sought for different&#13;
social-psychological reasons of the family or society. Ruling regimes used&#13;
it to recruit future managerial manpower and military service conscripts,&#13;
and to solve social problems; the church searched for its leadership and&#13;
missionaries; artisans and later industrialists recruited their apprentice-&#13;
ship manpower; and parents used it to solve economic needs or to facilitate&#13;
social mobility of their offspring or because of internal family crisis.&#13;
Later the nuclear family "inward-bound" intimacy, democratization&#13;
or because of internal family crisis of local and regional secondary educa-&#13;
tion, the social-consciousness about youth wotk, the psychological mental&#13;
health propositions about mother-child separation, the rising costs of good&#13;
quality residence facilities, and the adolescent quest for individualized-&#13;
personalized socialization combined to decrease the relative status of&#13;
boarding-out education. An extreme example in this direction is the UOSO&#13;
where boarding education was completely discarded and an assumption prevailea&#13;
that the worst family environment is better than institutional placement0   In&#13;
Israel, because of very different pressures (the need to absorb large numbers&#13;
of refugee children during the Hitler regime, collective value-orientation rf&#13;
socialist pioneers and the availability of the kibbutz option, demands for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
vocational training not available locally, the need for agricultural educa-&#13;
tion for those with no farm-life background, the need for the army to prepare&#13;
early trained manpower, and a cultural-religious tradition of leaving home&#13;
during adolescence in search of traditional intellectualism), a large-scale&#13;
and diversified network of boarding-out educational facilities of varying&#13;
direction and quality deveioped. Today about one-fourth of all 14-17 year&#13;
old secondary students and one-third of all 16-17 year old students are in&#13;
boarding facilities.&#13;
All the positive and negative aspects of this option cannot be dis-&#13;
cussed here. The variety of institutional arrangements available in Israel&#13;
provides programs with different goals, tasks, and quality of performance&#13;
(integration of disadvantaged youth in kibbutz regular education, special&#13;
youth socialization programs in the kibbutz by an organization called Youth&#13;
Aliyah, specialized para-military and technical schools of the armed services&#13;
branches, religious education schools, youth villages -- both general and&#13;
religious, agricultural and maritime schools, special schools for the more&#13;
gifted among the disadvantaged, special programs for the mentally retarded&#13;
or emotionally disturbed, etc.). Although some evaluations of programs in&#13;
Israel are available (Fuerstein, R., 1972; Smilansky, M. and Nevo, D.,&#13;
1977; Aries, 1962), they-are still very limited relative to the need&#13;
and potential learning opportunity for all concerned. What seems to&#13;
be important for this discussion is that there is no question that&#13;
many adolescents and families need an option of part-time or full-time&#13;
separation from the family, and that the "total" environment of a&#13;
boarding institution is a potentially powerful intervention medium for many&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
62 -&#13;
youth. Even in terms of economic efficiency, a study of the cost-effective-&#13;
ness of the army, departments of labor and agriculture and a follow-up&#13;
evaluation for the Ministry of Education of the program for the more gifted&#13;
among the disadvantaged (Smilansky, M. and Nevo, D., Chapters 9 and 11, 1976)&#13;
demonstrate that the increased investment may have a high "2production"u return.&#13;
IV. Conclusions and Recommendations&#13;
On the basis of all the evidence discussed, for developing countries&#13;
we recommend family building and youth education projects, that will also&#13;
include care for young children0 This recommendation will be capitalizing on&#13;
what we learned from both family-oriented programs and youth programs.,&#13;
Adolescence and youth are potentially promising periods for foster-&#13;
ing programs. At present these age groups are either neglected or fL-uflcU uI&#13;
rigid, archaic forms of secondary schooling -- which are not adapted to the&#13;
needs of their populations for developing the capacity for self-renewal and&#13;
problem-solving and for social and economic planning of less developedl&#13;
countries0 Experimental programs that are framed in a broader context of&#13;
family building and community development need to be developed0&#13;
Since I suggested some conceptual options for a new focus to&#13;
adolescent education, the next step should be a more detailed discussion&#13;
of case studies of new models in youth education0 Then priority should be&#13;
allocated to experimenting in adaptation of potentially relevant models to&#13;
different ecological settings0&#13;
Adolescent and youth education may also be supportive of better ele-&#13;
mentary education0 The concern has been expressed that in less developed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
countries, elementary education would suffer if limited resources were&#13;
channeled to adolescent youth programs.    Although the design and develop-&#13;
ment of elementary education should be a topic for special independent&#13;
consideration, one remark may be relevant here. It should be possible in&#13;
less developed countries to design adolescent and youth education on a&#13;
contract basis. About half of an adolescent's weekly schedule cculd be&#13;
devoted to tutorial work in preschool and elementary education (as well as in&#13;
other community improvement responsibilities) with professional supervision&#13;
provided by qualified teachers and counselors and the other half could be&#13;
geared toward the other needs for self-development and coping capacity.&#13;
Needs of working mothers for day-care centers can be met through&#13;
programs for adolescents, youth, and family building. For working mothers&#13;
who need institutional care for their younger children, day-car= w6.l.rG&#13;
should be established as an integrated part of programs for adolescents. A&#13;
school for adolescents and youth should be a laboratory of experience in&#13;
fostering younger children, teaching adolescents how children develop and&#13;
providing training in responsible action for human care. Also, such centers&#13;
would provide opportunities for partially paid work for youth and mothers&#13;
under the supervision of qualified teachers. Training of counselors to guide&#13;
adolescents in learning and performing such new roles can be deveiopeu --&#13;
conceptually and practically - and adapted to the community.&#13;
For educational intervention to have a long-range impact it must&#13;
be: longitudinal, adaptable, family building oriented, and a community&#13;
development supportive effort. A community for this purpose could be an&#13;
eco-system of a rural village, an urban setting, or a boarding school.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
I assume that powerful fostering programs, adapted to different&#13;
needs and options in developing countries, can be developed if there is a&#13;
commitment to such a proposition. H1aaver, it is not possible to translate&#13;
conceptual hypothetical propositions into programs adapted to the neetds of&#13;
people in developing countries, except through a process of systemati.c exÂ°&#13;
perimentingo There is a need to support a rcscarch and development p-roject&#13;
committed to this goal. Its objectives would be to further conceptualize&#13;
and adapt to the realities of the community our general propooitions for&#13;
development. This could be done through the following activities:     need&#13;
assessment, conceptualization of options, incorporation of elements cf other&#13;
programs into an integrated resource program, training of initial leadership&#13;
staff for these countries, implementation, evaluation, etc0&#13;
In the U.So more than 200 million dollars were invested during the&#13;
past decade (by different government agencies, public foundations, and others)&#13;
in research and experimental programs that may be relevant to our propositions&#13;
for developing countries. Investments (of a smaller scale but in some cases&#13;
not less significant) in other countries (England, Sweden, Israel, Canada,&#13;
and others) also produced options that should be explored, evaluated, and&#13;
utilized0 Through such a project, the World Bank could capitalize on these&#13;
large-scale investments-and provide a valuable input for developing countries&#13;
willing to associate0 The project could contribute guidelines for planning&#13;
and development of modular programs, curriculum units, media for learning,&#13;
and training or provision of senior staff from developing countries who would&#13;
initiate and coordinate the program and provide consultation in the process&#13;
of local development and evaluation0&#13;

            This paper presents and evaluates the
            broad results of pre-school intervention experiments and
            programs aimed at fostering the intellectual and social
            development of disadvantaged groups. Among the general
            findings discussed are that there is a sensitive, or even
            critical, period in child development, an age at which a
            child will be more susceptible to fostering; that a dominant
            share of intelligence develops during early childhood; that
            a gap in IQ between advantaged and disadvantaged groups
            exists before school entrance and widens thereafter; that
            traditional kindergartens do not protect disadvantaged
            children from lagging behind or failing in school; and that
            malnutrition or poor health have a marked effect on
            intellectual development. While studies have shown that IQ
            may be accelerated through pre-school programs, preschool is
            not the cure-all it was anticipated to be. Generally,
            children with initially lower IQs show the largest gains.
            But, in most studies, it was found that within a few years
            the children who were not in the special programs made up
            the difference with the fostered group.
