Component-Sharing:&#13;
Up-Scaling Demand-Responsive Approaches in&#13;
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector in Pakistan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Water and Sanitation ProgramÂ­South Asia (WSP-SA), in partnership with Government of Pakistan (GoP) agencies, has been&#13;
working to implement the Rio/Dublin Principles in the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (RWSS) sector in the country. Notable&#13;
progress has been made, although considerable challenges remain.The overarching objectives of RWSS development activities&#13;
continue to be improving access to, quality of, and gender and spatial equity in, delivery of services. In order to achieve these&#13;
objectives, adoption of community-driven and demand-responsive implementation arrangements, leads to substantial savings in&#13;
capital and recurrent project costs and also strengthens sustainability. Component-sharing is a very effective strategy to&#13;
implement Demand-Responsive Approaches (DRAs).&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  Over the past few years, several models have been used to make capital cost-sharing&#13;
  operational. Component-sharing is one such approach. It is transparent, less liable to abuse,&#13;
  and more practical to implement.&#13;

      The Rio/Dublin Principles&#13;
&#13;
      An International Conference on Water and the Environment at Dublin in January 1992 enunciated the four&#13;
      Rio/Dublin Principles:&#13;
&#13;
      (1) Fresh water is a finite and vulnerable resource, essential to sustain life, development and the environment&#13;
&#13;
      (2) Water development and management should be based on a participatory approach, involving users, planners&#13;
          and policy-makers at all levels&#13;
&#13;
      (3) Women play a central part in the provision, management and safeguarding of water&#13;
&#13;
      (4) Water has an economic value in all its competing uses and should be recognized as an economic good.&#13;

1A distinction is made between need and demand for a service. Need is simply the desire to have a service. When this need is backed up by a willingness to&#13;
pay for the service, partially or fully, it is described as demand.&#13;

Box 5&#13;
&#13;
     Community-Contracting: Procuring Construction Services&#13;
&#13;
   With component-sharing, communities themselves are responsible for a number of project components,&#13;
   including procurement of materials, transportation and even construction. In any case, for small (social sector)&#13;
   development projects, most materials as well as requisite skills are available locally. Thus, it would seem more&#13;
   prudent to entrust contracts for all related works and services to the communities. This would also be in the&#13;
   true spirit of community empowerment. Unfortunately, the legal framework for public sector development in&#13;
   Pakistan did (and, in many areas, still does) not allow it. This is a significant impediment in realizing the full&#13;
   potential of a public/NGO/community partnership. In Pakistan, as in AJK, public sector agencies normally&#13;
   engage private sector firms for providing construction services. These firms act as vendors for supply of skilled/&#13;
   unskilled labor and materials, and also coordinate construction activities. But, in the case of small, component-&#13;
   sharing-based projects, use of an external vendor may actually be counterproductive, since most private firms do&#13;
   not have the skills for interaction with communities and normally have relatively high overhead costs.&#13;
&#13;
   AJK presents a remarkable model for contracting by the community. It has had a legal framework for a&#13;
   component-sharing model for almost 40 years. A Manual of Instructions (or Dastoorul Amal in the official Urdu&#13;
   language) was first published as far back as in 1964. In 1990, the Manual was revised and updated. There are&#13;
   plans now to make available copies of the Manual to all offices concerned.&#13;
&#13;
   The Manual lays down the procedure, allowing the community to undertake procurement of all construction&#13;
   work. The LG&amp;RDD acts primarily as a technical advisor, facilitator and a conduit for the public sector grants&#13;
   provided to the community in the form of funds and materials such as pipes, pumps, etc. WSC members are&#13;
   jointly held responsible. In this way, as far as LG&amp;RDD is concerned, the communities are the owners.&#13;
   Construction of small tanks is completely the responsibility of the community and is not included in the project&#13;
   cost. Similarly, the community also makes provision of land and rights to source of water at no cost to the&#13;
   project. For larger overhead tanks (with a capacity of more than 5,000 gallons), the community undertakes the&#13;
   procurement of construction services in accordance with the project specifications. The community is free to&#13;
   use any procurement method (sole-source, limited or full competition, etc.). Payments are released by the&#13;
   public agency to the community in pre-specified tranches based on satisfactory construction progress and&#13;
   quality. The community is responsible to pay the contractors. LG&amp;RDD and WSC jointly undertake procurement&#13;
   of technically more complex tasks. LG&amp;RDD invites the bids and WSC participates in bid evaluation and&#13;
   approval. On identification of the lowest evaluated bid, WSC issues the work order.The funds are released by&#13;
   LG&amp;RDD to WSC to be disbursed to the supplier on performance that is certified as satisfactory by WSC and&#13;
   LG&amp;RDD.Transportation of pipes from the nearest road to the project site and their installation is the complete&#13;
   responsibility of the community. It is believed that this simplified contracting method has reduced cost, execution&#13;
   time, and has improved quality of construction.&#13;

            Component-Sharing : up-scaling
            demand-responsive approaches in rural water supply and
            sanitation sector in Pakistan
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Over the past few years, several models
            have been used to make capital cost-sharing operational.
            Component-sharing is one such approach. It is transparent,
            less liable to abuse, and more practical to implement. This
            field note presents three models of component-sharing with
            differing elements necessitated by the specific environment
            of each model: (a) Local Government &amp; Rural Development
            Department's (LG&amp;RDD) water supply schemes in Azad
            Jammu and Kashmir (AJK); (b) Sanitation schemes in Lodhran
            district of the Punjab being implemented by Lodhran Pilot
            Project (LPP); and (c) The erstwhile Public Health
            Engineering Department's (PHED) pilot water supply
            schemes in Sindh. The models are not comparable in terms of
            size. The AJK model covers the entire rural water supply
            system in AJK and has been in place for over a decade. The
            Lodhran and Sindh models, on the other hand, represent pilot
            activities in a few districts of the provinces of the Punjab
            and Sindh, respectively. Each model, however, has
            significant lessons to offer.
