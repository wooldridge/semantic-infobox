    .or many years, experts, and aid agencies determined how water was to be&#13;
    supplied to rural and urban communities. However, the culture of expert knows&#13;
    best has slowly given way to considering people who matter  the consumers.&#13;
    Participatory techniques have been used to elicit community preferences, and&#13;
    economists have contributed substantially to these procedures through the&#13;
    application of stated preference analysis. In stated preference, opinions and&#13;
    willingness to pay of individuals are sought about the issue in question, in this&#13;
    case, water. Compared to non-economic procedures, stated preference&#13;
    techniques are not only participatory but are also founded in the rigors of&#13;
    statistical theory and economics. If nothing else, this ensures consistency and&#13;
    comparability across studies. Increasingly, these techniques are being applied to&#13;
    major issues such as malaria risks, the loss of ecosystems, types of crop,&#13;
    soil conservation measures, and so on.&#13;

&#13;
During the last couple of decades, the efforts of the government, NGOs, and&#13;
donor agencies have succeeded in creating a water miracle in Bangladesh.&#13;
A combination of three important factors has enabled over 95 percent of rural&#13;
households to access clean, drinking water through tubewells: the shallow water&#13;
aquifers of the country, a sustained public sector campaign encouraging people&#13;
to shift from pathogen-contaminated surface water to ground sources, and the&#13;
introduction of handpump technology. The shallow tubewell technology,&#13;
purchased directly by households from the market, created perhaps the largest&#13;
private sector supported safe drinking water program in South Asia, if not the&#13;
developing world.&#13;
&#13;

However, the contamination of shallow aquifers with         While the figures are unconfirmed, estimates&#13;

&#13;
  are some areas where population density and                    service delivery at the local level. Yet, by nature,&#13;
  income levels may warrant a household-based                    local governments are closest to a crisis of the kind&#13;
  technology. Keeping the option of choice open is               being experienced in the drinking water sector&#13;
  important, especially in a context where                       where alternative solutions will be specific to local&#13;
  technologies and technology costs may be                       contexts. The arsenic crisis has opened the door to&#13;
  constantly changing. It should be noted from the               rethink the role of local government in Bangladesh.&#13;
  findings that the preference for piped water is                Can local governments be empowered to manage&#13;
  driven more by the convenience factor and less by              a community-based response to the arsenic crisis?&#13;
  the issue of arsenic, reflecting perhaps a growing             Can local governments support the emergence of&#13;
  structural shift in the preferences of rural                   independent service providers in rural areas thus&#13;
  households for water services. This shift is largely           drawing on existing NGO capacity? These are&#13;
  independent of the arsenic crisis but nevertheless             critical issues of local governance being brought&#13;
  strengthened by it.                                            out as a direct result of the arsenic crisis.&#13;
6. The study clearly brings out the low level of           8. Another issue indirectly raised by the study is the&#13;
  knowledge and awareness of the health effects of               significance of monitoring water quality. In the&#13;
  arsenic contamination, even in arsenic-affected                euphoria of the private sector-led approach to&#13;
  areas. .or a national crisis of the magnitude that             drinking water delivery, the issue of monitoring&#13;
  Bangladesh is currently facing, household and                  water quality was largely ignored in Bangladesh.&#13;
  public awareness of arsenic contamination,                     Arsenic contamination has now raised the issue&#13;
  its seriousness in terms of its effect on public health,       of institutionalizing mechanisms to monitor water&#13;
  and various technology options need to be                      quality in the country. Establishing standards,&#13;

7. The government should play a more important role              agency, developing a monitoring process, and&#13;
  in the drinking water sector because many of the               linking this with local governments are policy&#13;
  issues that need to be addressed when tackling the             issues that require to be addressed even as&#13;
  arsenic problem, such as dissemination of                      immediate solutions to the arsenic crisis&#13;
  information, ensuring choice and options,                      are developed.&#13;
  monitoring of water quality, and most importantly        .urther research&#13;
  managing the introduction of a network system,           This study raises a number of issues that may guide&#13;
  require the governments involvement on a large           future research. An important issue is to establish the&#13;
  scale. During the 1980s, the role of the                 extent that stated willingness to pay could be translated&#13;
  government in rural water supply diminished greatly      into actual willingness to pay, and the role of&#13;
  as the private sector spearheaded and supported          institutional arrangements for service delivery in this&#13;

  new situation calls for a revival of the assertive role  regard. With the implementation of more pilot piped&#13;

  of the government. In this context, the role of local    water supply projects in rural areas with different&#13;
&#13;
  governments in the drinking water sector in              institutional models of delivery, it would be possible to&#13;

  Bangladesh needs to be explored. In the unitary          study the responses to this issue.&#13;

  governments have not been given the space to             information for policy makers; the pilots being&#13;
  emerge as key players in the management of               implemented will provide equally important inputs.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
In most areas of Bangladesh, groundwater has dangerously high levels of arsenic&#13;
contamination and the number of people affected by arsenic is the largest facing any&#13;
disease in the world today (WHO, 2002). Estimates of the number of people,&#13;
in Bangladesh, exposed to unsafe levels of arsenic in their drinking water varies from&#13;
28-35 million to a high of 77 million people (Ahmed and Ahmed, 2002:99;&#13;
WHO, 2002). These figures would mean that between a quarter to half of the total&#13;
population of the country, estimated at about 129 million as on July 2000&#13;
(Ahmed and Ahmed, 2002; UN, 2000), is at risk of exposure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The problem of arsenic-contaminated tubewells in                               tubewells decreased, as the private sectors&#13;
Bangladesh was identified in the early 1990s.                                  participation in the program increased, and a large&#13;
Traditionally, shallow ponds were the source of                                number of tubewells were supplied and installed with&#13;
drinking water. However, due to the lack of adequate                           their support (Smith et al., 2000:1094). The task of&#13;

agencies, particularly UNICE., actively promoted the                           was provided with bacteriologically safe tubewell&#13;
use of groundwater in the 1970s, and a large number                            water. At present, there are about 6 to 8 million&#13;
of shallow tubewells were installed (WHO, 2000).                               shallow tubewells in the country (Ahmed and Ahmed,&#13;
During the 1980s, UNICE.s support for installing                               2002:92)2 and 97 percent of the rural drinking water&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
In the context of the large-scale contamination of tubewells with arsenic in&#13;
Bangladesh, an immediate concern is to provide safe water free from arsenic as&#13;
well as other chemical and bacteriological contamination. However, the&#13;
technology that is promoted to provide safe water should have features that are&#13;
desirable in any water supply system. The technology should provide an&#13;
adequate supply of water throughout the year, be safe to operate, convenient to&#13;
use, acceptable, and robust. An important related issue is whether households&#13;
have the competence to operate and maintain the technology. This chapter&#13;
discusses available safe water options in Bangladesh and presents a review of&#13;
two recent studies that have evaluated arsenic mitigation technologies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.1 Arsenic mitigation technologies&#13;
In areas where drinking water contains unsafe levels    Heijnen, 2001; Mudgal, 2000). These include:&#13;
of arsenic, the main options to provide safe water are&#13;
either to remove arsenic from the contaminated          !  Oxidation and stripping&#13;
&#13;
source or to find a new safe source of water supply     !  Coagulation, precipitation, and filtering using iron&#13;
(Johnston and Heijnen, 2001; WSP-SA, 2000:3).              and aluminium salts&#13;
The options have been discussed below in detail.&#13;
                                                        !  Lime softening&#13;
&#13;
2.1.1 Removing arsenic from existing                    !  Ion exchange&#13;

                                                        !&#13;
Most technologies for arsenic removal make use of          Membrane process (reverse osmosis)&#13;
&#13;
several processes either at the same time or in         !  Adsorption on activated alumina/ activated&#13;
sequence, and have the advantage of removing other         carbon/ activated bauxite/ ferric hydroxide&#13;
undesirable compounds as well.                             The three major factors to be considered when&#13;
   Several methods can be used to treat water and       choosing an arsenic removal treatment system are the&#13;
make it arsenic-free (Ahmed, 2001; Johnston and         cost, reliability, and ease of O&amp;M of the technology.&#13;
                                                                                                                  7&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Based on these considerations, the processes of                                        piped water supply (Ahmed and Ahmed, 2002;&#13;
    coagulation, precipitation and filtering,5 and adsorption6                             BRAC, 2000; WSP-SA, 2000).&#13;
    are regarded as relatively more suitable for rural&#13;
    households than the other methods listed above.                                             Groundwater in deeper aquifers (below 150 to&#13;
                                                                                           200 meters) is generally free of arsenic (Ahmed and&#13;
        The membrane process and ion exchange are                                          Ahmed, 2002) and can be used as an alternate&#13;

    the cost is high and the technical requirements are                                    tubewells (UNICE., 2000). Surface water from ponds&#13;
    hard to meet (Mudgal, 2000). Reverse osmosis, for                                      or rivers can be boiled or filtered at home to remove&#13;
    example, requires a special membrane and water to                                      bacteriological contamination. .or use at the&#13;
    pass through the filter under high pressure, which may                                 community level, serving 40-60 families or more,&#13;
    not be practical in rural households. The ion                                          pond sand filters can be used to filter water from&#13;
    exchange process is uneconomic if the total dissolved                                  ponds that are reserved exclusively for drinking&#13;
    solid is more than 500 mg/l, which is common in                                        purposes (Ahmed and Ahmed, 2002; BRAC, 2000;&#13;

&#13;
        The oxidation and stripping method is relatively                                        Rainwater can also be a source of water supply. A tin&#13;
    simpler to implement. However, this method is often                                    roof or a plastic sheet can be used to collect rainwater,&#13;
    ineffective in reducing arsenic concentration to the                                   which is then stored in a large cement tank. Rainwater is&#13;
    desired level. .or example, passive sedimentation                                      free from arsenic and bacteriological contamination.&#13;
    (which involves putting water in a bucket, stirring so as                              These harvesting systems can be successfully used in&#13;
    to allow air oxidation, and then letting the water settle                              areas where rainfall is adequate throughout the year.&#13;
    for about 12 hours) is a simple method to remove                                       However, the water harvested through these systems is&#13;
    arsenic in rural areas. However, studies have shown                                    susceptible to bacteriological contamination during the&#13;
    that this method is not effective in reducing arsenic to                               process of collection and storage, and may require&#13;
    the desired level (Ahmed, 2001; Khan et al., 2000;                                     some form of treatment (Adeel and Ali, 2002).&#13;
    WSP-SA, 2000:7).                                                                            Dugwells are 25 to 30 feet deep. Although high&#13;
        The lime softening process leads to high pH levels,                                arsenic levels may be present in shallow aquifers&#13;
    which need to be readjusted. Moreover, a large                                         (which are 20 to 40 meters below the ground),&#13;
    volume of waste is generated. Compared to                                              ultra-shallow aquifers (1-10 meters deep) generally&#13;

    Three main sources of water can be considered as                                       not be safe because it is very difficult to protect it from&#13;
    substitutes for arsenic-contaminated shallow tubewell                                  bacteriological contamination. The problem can be&#13;
    water: groundwater in deeper aquifers, rainwater, and                                  addressed by lining the dugwell with concrete and&#13;
    surface water. Two other options are dugwells and                                      protecting it (using a handpump to lift the water and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        5In the precipitation process, dissolved arsenic is made to form a low-solubility solid mineral, which is then removed through sedimentation and filtration.&#13;
        When coagulants are added and form flocs, other dissolved compounds such as arsenic become insoluble and form solids. This is known as coprecipitation.&#13;
        The solids formed require removal through solid/liquid separation processes (see Johnston and Heijnen, 2001).&#13;
        6Various solid materials, including iron and aluminum hydroxide flocs, have a strong affinity to dissolved arsenic. Arsenic is strongly attached to the&#13;
        sorption sites of these solids, and is effectively removed from the solution. This is the adsorption process for arsenic removal (see Johnston and Heijnen,&#13;
        2001).&#13;
        7Water is purified in a pond sand filter in two stages: through a horizontal roughing filter and a slow sand filter. Instead of a roughing filter, pond water&#13;
&#13;
8       can be pre-treated using other methods such as by adding alum, followed by coagulation and settling (BRAC, 2000).&#13;

Moreover, since piped water is               in the neighborhood, rather than an alternate source (or install equipment&#13;

    Measuring peoples preferences for non-market commodities, such as an&#13;
    improvement in the quality of the environment, poses significant methodological&#13;
    challenges. The challenges were far greater for this study on the demand for safe&#13;
    arsenic-free drinking water (a non-market commodity) in rural Bangladesh.&#13;
    This is because multiple options are available for obtaining safe arsenic-free&#13;
    drinking water, and it was necessary to incorporate this choice into the analysis.&#13;
    Moreover, a suitable methodology was required to estimate the value of&#13;
    arsenic-free drinking water to the rural people.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The field study discussed in this report (hereafter                                    preferred option between piped water and other&#13;
     referred to as the Bangladesh study) used a detailed                                   arsenic mitigation technologies.&#13;

     options in rural areas and evaluate peoples                                            were surveyed. To ensure that responses were&#13;
     perceptions of available arsenic mitigation                                            representative, people were interviewed in arsenic-&#13;
     technologies12 (other than piped water) and piped                                      affected areas, arsenic-free areas, and areas where&#13;

     methodology was used to assess the demand for                                          contaminated sources to arsenic-free supply. By&#13;
     piped water in rural areas and establish the extent to                                 including arsenic-free areas in the survey, it was&#13;

     setting up an alternate safe piped water supply system.                                arsenic-affected areas with that in arsenic-free areas,&#13;
     The survey data helped to ascertain peoples choices                                    and thus derive an estimate of the arsenic-free&#13;
     among arsenic mitigation technologies, their                                           component out of the total value of piped water to the&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
         12  Arsenic mitigation technologies are defined as technologies that enable people in arsenic-affected areas to access arsenic-free water. These include&#13;
         both arsenic removal technologies (or arsenic treatment technologies) and alternate arsenic-safe water sources, such as deep tubewells and pond sand&#13;
         filters. Piped water basically belongs to the latter category of arsenic mitigation technologies. However, throughout the study, this option will be&#13;
         considered separate from other arsenic-free water sources. Accordingly, arsenic mitigation technologies will be used to refer to arsenic removal&#13;
&#13;
14       technologies and alternate arsenic-safe water sources, except piped water which is considered as a separate option.&#13;

Through contingent valuation surveys, people are                                  responses are validated. There are different&#13;

understating their willingness to pay) can seriously                              methods (for instance, the revealed preference&#13;
distort the results of a contingent valuation survey.                             method) (Carson et al., 2001). It must be noted,&#13;
To curb such strategic bias, a dichotomous choice                                 however, that both the contingent valuation and&#13;

 !    A meaningful and realistic questionnaire was designed to assess household willingness to&#13;
      pay for arsenic-free, safe drinking water.&#13;
&#13;
 !    Biases normally associated with such a survey were minimized.&#13;
&#13;
 !    Validity checks to cross-check willingness to pay values were especially designed using&#13;
      revealed preference criteria.&#13;
&#13;
 !    The draft questionnaire was externally reviewed.&#13;
&#13;
 !    The questionnaire was presented at WSP-SA and BRAC (R&amp;D) and finalized.&#13;

&#13;
 !    A survey was conducted in three hydrogeologically representative districts with arsenic&#13;
      contamination. In each district, three severely affected thanas were identified for the survey.&#13;
&#13;
 !    A stratified random sampling methodology was used to select five villages in each identified&#13;
      thana, and 53-55 households in each village.&#13;
&#13;
 !    About 800 households were surveyed in the arsenic-affected areas in each district (totaling to&#13;
      2,430 households) and 300 households were surveyed in an arsenic-free, control area.&#13;
&#13;
 !    In addition, 150 households were surveyed in an arsenic-affected area where there has been&#13;
      a large-scale shift to arsenic-free water sources. This component of the survey was done in&#13;
      five randomly selected villages in one thana of Barisal district, and 30 households randomly&#13;
      selected from each village.&#13;
&#13;
 !    In all, 2,880 households were surveyed.&#13;

&#13;
                                         Analyzing the data&#13;
&#13;
 !    Econometric methodology (a multinomial logit model) was used to analyze the data and&#13;
      derive estimates of willingness to pay.&#13;
&#13;
 !    Relevant and statistically significant explanatory variables were identified.&#13;
&#13;
 !    Preliminary results on willingness to pay were presented at WSP-SA and comments/&#13;
      suggestions incorporated to prepare the draft report.&#13;
&#13;
 !    The draft report was reviewed by an expert on contingent valuation methodology before&#13;
      finalization.&#13;

&#13;
         "Let me now turn to the question of cost-sharing. But, before that, I should give you some&#13;
     details of a piped water supply scheme for the village. Water will be supplied twice a day &#13;
     for two hours in the morning and two hours in the evening. The pressure will be adequate to fully&#13;
     satisfy your need for drinking, cooking, bathing, and washing. The timings of the water supply will&#13;
     be reliable. .or those opting for public standposts, one post will be shared by five/seven families.&#13;

     house. Potable quality water will be supplied, free from arsenic and bacteriological&#13;
     contamination.&#13;
         The water supply scheme will be implemented and managed by the agency of your choice.&#13;
     You have a choice between a public standpost and a domestic connection. Please bear in mind&#13;

  Evolution of contingent valuation methodology&#13;
  Initially contingent valuation studies (conducted by Davis, 1963; Randall et al., 1974) focused on&#13;
  incentives and free-rider issues, with psychometric issues treated as incidental problems that would&#13;
  disappear when the subject had a positive incentive to be truthful. Davis employed an&#13;
  open-ended protocol in which the subject was asked to state his/her maximum willingness to pay.&#13;
  Randall employed a sequential bidding protocol in which the subject was asked for a series of votes&#13;
  on referendums (take-it or leave-it for a quoted price, done repeatedly for a series of prices)&#13;
  converging to a willingness to pay figure.&#13;
&#13;
      The most commonly used protocols in the early 1980s were the open-ended or used payment&#13;
  cards, the latter requesting a choice from a series of ranges. The referendum protocol, stripped of the&#13;
  sequential bidding feature so that the subject was offered a single bid that varied across subjects&#13;
  according to an experimental design, was re-introduced by Bishop and Heberlein (1979) and&#13;
  Hanemann (1984). The protocol was further developed in the later half of the 1980s. By 1993, the&#13;
  referendum protocol with a single bid, or in some applications with a follow-up bid known as double&#13;
  referendum, eclipsed the open-ended protocol. A blue-ribbon panel, assembled by the National&#13;
  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to assess the reliability of contingent valuation&#13;
  methodology, endorsed the single referendum protocol as the preferred procedure for contingent&#13;
  valuation study.&#13;
&#13;
      It is known that the single referendum protocol is statistically inefficient compared to the&#13;
  open-ended protocol, requiring a substantially larger sample to achieve the same level of precision.&#13;
  It also needs more complex econometric techniques to derive estimates of willingness to pay. Yet the&#13;
  referendum protocol has found widespread and relatively uncritical acceptance. This is because the&#13;
  analysts feel that this protocol is easier for the respondent to answer and is incentive compatible, and&#13;
  thus relatively free from strategic biases. Also, it is felt that the referendum method mimics the&#13;
  political referendums, which are an accepted mechanism for social choice.&#13;
&#13;
      Literature on contingent valuation over the last two decades has focused on methodological&#13;
  issues, particularly the issue of biases in responses obtained to the valuation question. A number of&#13;
  studies have tested for biases, such as the hypothetical scenario mis-specification bias and strategic&#13;
  bias, and the findings have been useful in understanding the magnitude and direction of the biases&#13;
  as well as the psychometric issues in contingent valuation. Based on the results of these studies,&#13;
  questionnaires can be designed better and biases minimized.&#13;

method                                                 contingent valuation method were compared with&#13;
The econometric model used for analyzing the           those obtained by the revealed preference method.&#13;
responses of households to the valuation question      The latter estimates were derived from the&#13;
in the survey helped to ascertain whether the          information collected in the survey on changes of&#13;
responses were consistent with the economic            source of drinking water due to arsenic&#13;
theory, particularly whether the demand for piped      contamination of the previous source and the cost&#13;
water increased with household income and              this has imposed on the households, particularly&#13;
decreased with hikes in piped water charges.           the cost of time spent to collect water and the cost&#13;

&#13;
    To understand peoples preferences and willingness to pay for safe water options,&#13;
    it is important to gather information on the socio-economic characteristics of the&#13;
    respondents covered in the survey. Indeed, the econometric models that have&#13;
    been applied in this study to explain the willingness to pay for piped water and&#13;
    the choice between piped water and other arsenic mitigation technologies have&#13;
    used the socio-economic characteristics of the respondents as explanatory&#13;
    variables (details are presented and discussed in Chapters 8-10). These data&#13;
    have also provided inputs into the analysis presented in subsequent chapters.&#13;

     of the household. The findings indicate that the                     members is presented in Table 4.14). In the sample&#13;
     average income per household was Tk 4,588 per                        area, households with a monthly income in the range&#13;
     month in the sample and control areas (Table 4.13).16                of Tk 1,001-5,000 accounted for about 75 percent of&#13;
     In the sample area, the average income level was                     the total households. Within this group, approximately&#13;
     highest in Chandpur, followed by Barisal and Chapai                  half the households earned Tk 1,001-2,000 a month&#13;
     Nawabganj, which is in accordance with the findings                  (22 percent) and Tk 2,001-3,000 per month&#13;
     of the survey that the number of earning members per                 (28 percent). Households earning up to Tk 1,000 a&#13;
     household in Chandpur was a little higher than in                    month constituted only about 3 percent of the total&#13;

&#13;
     and 43 percent in farming, whereas in Chapai                         Nawabganj (3 percent). A significant number of&#13;

    To what extent are households in Bangladesh aware of the consequences of&#13;
    consuming arsenic-contaminated water? Do they perceive arsenic exposure as a&#13;
    potential threat to their families? Are they aware of the symptoms caused by&#13;
    arsenic toxicity? To assess peoples awareness of the symptoms of arsenicosis,&#13;
    and their knowledge and concerns regarding the health risks associated with&#13;
    arsenic contamination, the study sought responses on whether households had&#13;
    heard about the problem of arsenic contamination in the country, their sources of&#13;
    information, whether they knew of any person affected by arsenicosis, if they&#13;
    were familiar with the symptoms of arsenicosis, and whether they could afford&#13;
    the cost of medical treatment. The findings of the survey are summarized in&#13;
    this chapter.&#13;

     Respondents in both the arsenic-affected and arsenic-    25 percent of the respondents reported that they were&#13;
     free areas were asked whether they were aware of the     aware of the problem. The lack of awareness in this&#13;
     arsenic problem and about the sources of their           area may be due to the low level of education&#13;
     information. The results indicate widespread             (53 percent of the respondents are illiterate compared&#13;
     awareness, with approximately 87 percent of the          to 35 percent in the sample area) coupled with the&#13;
     respondents in the sample area and about 53 percent      fact that arsenic contamination is not posing any&#13;
     in the control area reporting that they were aware of    immediate problem to residents of the area.&#13;

         21 There is a need for caution when drawing inferences from Table 5.8. During the interview, respondents were first asked whether they were aware that&#13;
         arsenic contamination could lead to cancer and gangrene, and then asked about affordability (to which most respondents replied that they would not be&#13;
         able to bear the cost of treatment at all). Both the questions and the replies were fresh in their mind when respondents were asked whether they considered&#13;
         arsenic contamination to be a serious threat. This may have prompted many respondents to say that they considered arsenic contamination to be a serious&#13;
42       threat to their familys health though prior to the interview this was not a major concern.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
The demand for alternative sources of water critically depends on the patterns of&#13;
daily use of water in the household and perceptions of how safe and convenient&#13;
current available sources are. Information was collected in the household and&#13;
village surveys to assess daily household water consumption for drinking and&#13;
cooking, the main sources of water, water quality and quantity, impact on health,&#13;
changes in water sources, and whether households continue to consume water&#13;
from contaminated sources after they have been tested and found unsafe.&#13;
Detailed findings on water use and shifts in consumption patterns are discussed&#13;
in this chapter.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6.1 Water consumption&#13;
The average daily water consumption per household                               water consumption are more or less the same in both&#13;
was assessed by asking respondents to estimate their                            seasons. As can be seen from Table 6.1, in the dry&#13;
water use according to different activities in the dry                          season each household used an average of 339 liters&#13;
and wet seasons. The results show that patterns of                              of water daily in the sample area and 382 liters in the&#13;

     Chapai Nawabganj, a number of households had                                       contamination reported by households&#13;
     shifted from public to private tubewells. In Barisal, in                           In the survey, households were asked whether the&#13;

Unlike earlier studies that focused mainly on the technology aspect of arsenic&#13;
treatment units and other arsenic-safe water options, and their effectiveness, an&#13;
important objective of the study on Bangladesh was to evaluate people's&#13;
preferences among selected arsenic mitigation technologies28 currently being&#13;
field-tested in the country. Six technologies were chosen for the study: the three-&#13;
kolshi (pitcher) method, the household-based activated alumina method, the&#13;

deep tubewells (more specifically, manually operated deep tubewell handpumps).&#13;
These technologies represent both arsenic reduction units (the three-kolshi and&#13;
activated alumina methods) as well as technologies that make use of alternate safe&#13;
water sources (dugwells, pond sand filters, and deep tubewells).29 The technologies&#13;
were carefully selected based on the findings of earlier studies in terms of their&#13;
effectiveness in mitigating arsenic and how communities responded to them in the&#13;
course of field trials (BRAC, 2000; BAMWSP, DFID, and WaterAid Bangladesh, 2001).&#13;

&#13;
   28For the purpose of this study, arsenic mitigation technologies are defined broadly as technologies that treat arsenic-contaminated tubewell water as&#13;
   well as those that enable households to access arsenic-safe water sources.&#13;
   29These six technologies will hereafter be referred to as the selected arsenic mitigation technologies or the six selected technologies.&#13;

   32 The finding that rural households prefer community-based arsenic mitigation technologies to household-based ones lends support to earlier studies on&#13;
   the subject. According to one report, "Some stakeholders have expressed doubts about the viability of 'household' arsenic units, and have suggested that&#13;
   'community' arsenic removal units are preferable. They note the difficulties associated with persuading millions of households to use arsenic removal units,&#13;
   and ensuring that they are used reliably, and the advantages of centralized operation and maintenance, including arsenic testing, by trained caretakers"&#13;
   (WSP-SA, 2000:14). It should be noted that from the point of view of a typical household, arsenic mitigation technologies are new, and hence risky. A&#13;
   household will, therefore, probably have a lower preference for household-based technologies as this involves individual risk. Community-based technologies&#13;
   involving community efforts and shared risks would have greater appeal.                                                                                         59&#13;

     preferred alternate safe water sources to a technology       afford the cost of the technology (44 percent) or that&#13;
&#13;
     that purifies arsenic-contaminated tubewell                  they were satisfied with the current water quality&#13;
&#13;
     water (Table 7.3).                                           (29 percent) (Table 7.5, Figure 7.2).&#13;
&#13;
         There were significant inter-district variations in          Comparing responses across districts,&#13;
&#13;
     this regard. In Chapai Nawabganj, there was a                unwillingness to pay for any of the selected&#13;
&#13;
     strong preference for technologies that treat tubewell       technologies was relatively higher in Barisal (37&#13;
&#13;
     water, while in Barisal and Chandpur households              percent) than in Chandpur (24 percent) and Chapai&#13;
     generally favored alternate safe water sources.              Nawabganj (11 percent). In Chapai Nawabganj,&#13;
     This difference could be explained by the fact that it is    most households were not willing to pay for arsenic&#13;
     relatively more expensive to install a tubewell in           mitigation technologies because they could not afford&#13;
     Chapai Nawabganj, so after a household has                   them while in Barisal, the primary reason was&#13;
                                                                  satisfaction with the current water quality (Table 7.5).&#13;

         34 It should be mentioned here that the technological advantages of activated alumina units over the three-kolshi method were explained in the&#13;
         interview. Respondents' possibly preferred the three-kolshi method over activated alumina units because the cost of three-kolshi technology was&#13;
         comparatively lower.&#13;
               Respondents were given the following cost estimates for the selected technologies: three-kolshi method ­ initial cost Tk 300 and annual O&amp;M&#13;
         cost Tk 150; activated alumina technology (household-based) ­ Tk 2,000 initially and annual O&amp;M cost Tk 1,200; activated alumina technology&#13;

respondents who had experience of using the                                    were subsidized by 25 percent or 50 percent. As&#13;

first preference and 2 ranked it second. Thus, the                             46 percent (or about 5 percent of households&#13;

survey results suggest that deep tubewells are                                 subsidized arsenic mitigation technologies -- about&#13;

    Comparative analysis of technology preferences of                          another about 30 percent were willing to use the&#13;
poor and non-poor households brings out that the                               technologies if the subsidy was increased to 50&#13;
preferences of the two categories were considerably                            percent. Thus, in all about 81 percent of the&#13;

was for deep tubewells, followed by three-kolshi                               without any subsidy and 5 percent with a&#13;

&#13;
As mentioned in Chapter 2, piped water supply schemes can provide a long-term&#13;
solution to the arsenic problem and are a major focus of this study. A significant&#13;
advantage of these systems is the convenience they provide. While meeting the&#13;
need of the household for arsenic-free water, they can also deliver water of the&#13;
appropriate quality and in adequate quantity. However, a crucial question is: are&#13;
rural households in Bangladesh willing to pay for piped water, and if so to what&#13;
extent? These issues are addressed in this chapter.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The questionnaire was designed to compare the            capital cost and O&amp;M of the scheme. Households&#13;
willingness of respondents to pay for piped water in     that were not able to contribute to the initial capital&#13;

Cost of piped water supply in rural Bangladesh&#13;
&#13;
The estimated cost of setting up and operating a piped water system in the three&#13;
areas covered in the study was based on the cost of four piped water supply&#13;
projects in Bangladesh -- the Bhashubihar project in Bogra (Rural Development&#13;
Academy); the rural piped water supply project of the Watsan Partnership Project&#13;
in Rajshahi; the rural water supply project in the Barind area (Barind Multipurpose&#13;
Development Authority); and the BRAC (Bangladesh Rural Advancement&#13;
Committee) project at Narayanganj. The DPHE was also consulted on the cost of&#13;
establishing piped water systems in deep tubewell areas (see Annex C for details).&#13;

of water sources and the dense settlement pattern                    (Figure 8.1). Fewer respondents opted for piped&#13;
in Bangladesh. However, as the coverage of                           water in the sub-samples where higher charges were&#13;
electrification in rural Bangladesh is relatively low,               quoted. In the first sub-sample where the lowest&#13;

      (Table 8.3).36 The results also show that the higher the                            was estimated (see Table 8.5). Estimates for the&#13;
      awareness and concern for arsenic contamination                                     amount households were willing to pay as an initial&#13;

      inference that can be drawn from the results is that                                were made.&#13;

      education (above Class X) raises the demand for a                                   each district) was derived using the estimated&#13;

&#13;
           36 These results (and the later finding that the mean willingness to pay for a domestic connection is more than for a public standpost) are consistent&#13;
           with economic theory, suggesting that the responses obtained to the contingent valuation question meet the test of construct validity (see Chapter 3).&#13;

    38Jiwanji (2000) has reviewed contingent valuation studies on the demand for improved water supply in developing countries. In 11 out of 15&#13;
    studies, households were willing to pay 0.5-2.5 percent of their income per month for piped water.&#13;
    39During 2001-02, the interest rate on deposits for two years or more with major banks in Bangladesh was 8-9 percent per annum. The&#13;
    agricultural lending rates ranged from 12 to 16 percent per annum. Therefore, the midpoint of these interest rates, that is, 12 percent, was used&#13;
    for the calculations.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
The survey data presented in the previous chapter clearly reflect a strong&#13;
preference for piped water supply. However, findings also show that majority of&#13;
households in the arsenic-affected areas are willing to pay for and use arsenic&#13;
mitigation technologies. This chapter explores household preferences between&#13;
piped water supply and arsenic mitigation technologies, and the reasons for their&#13;
choice. As arsenic mitigation technologies are not of interest to households in the&#13;
arsenic-free control area, households in the control area were not asked about&#13;
these technologies and hence were not required to make a choice between piped&#13;
water and the arsenic mitigation technologies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
9.1 Choice between piped water&#13;
supply and arsenic mitigation&#13;
technologies&#13;
Respondents were asked to state their preference                                 there was an 80 percent capital subsidy on the&#13;
between piped water supply and their most preferred                              technologies. Such questions are useful to study the&#13;
arsenic mitigation technology (out of the six included                           sensitivity of respondents to the level of subsidy on&#13;
in the study), and the reasons for their choice.                                 arsenic mitigation technologies.&#13;
However, because of the asymmetry between the&#13;
charges quoted in the survey for piped water and                                      Most respondents (89 percent) showed a&#13;
&#13;
arsenic mitigation technologies,41 households were                               preference for piped water supply over arsenic&#13;
&#13;
asked to make a choice between the two options                                   mitigation technologies (taking into account aspects&#13;
under two conditions: with no capital subsidy for                                of cost, convenience, and other issues) (Table 9.1,&#13;
arsenic mitigation technologies, and assuming that                               Figure 9.1).42 Even with the provision of 80 percent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    41While it was assumed that households would pay only a part (about 10-20 percent or one-fifth) of the initial capital cost of piped water systems,&#13;
    the charges for arsenic mitigation technologies did not have any built-in subsidy on capital cost.&#13;
    42Table 9.1 and Figure 9.1 are based on data for 2,280 households out of a total of 2,430 households covered in the sample area. Respondents&#13;
    who did not want to contribute to the capital cost of piped water schemes (150 respondents) were excluded from the analysis.                           83&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
       In some arsenic-contaminated areas of Bangladesh, a large number of&#13;
       households have in recent years shifted their drinking water source from private&#13;
       tubewells to deep public tubewells that provide safe arsenic-free water. The&#13;
       survey fielded in the sample and control areas was also canvassed in these areas&#13;
       to establish whether households that are accessing safe arsenic-free water would&#13;
       prefer piped water as an alternate source of water supply. The extent to which&#13;
       they would be willing to share the cost of setting up and operating such schemes&#13;
       was also assessed.&#13;
&#13;
          In this phase of the study, 150 households were surveyed in five villages in&#13;
       Banaripara thana,44 Barisal district. Thirty households were randomly chosen&#13;
       from each village. The econometric model applied to the data for the sample and&#13;
       control areas (see Chapter 8 and Annex B) was used to analyze household&#13;
       preferences and to estimate the mean willingness to pay in Banaripara. This&#13;
       chapter presents the findings and compares them with the findings of the analysis&#13;
       of preferences and willingness to pay in the sample and control areas.&#13;

&#13;
          44Banaripara was selected for the study because though the area faces a problem of groundwater arsenic contamination, most people were not exposed&#13;
          to arsenic poisoning as they had shifted to public tubewells.&#13;
          45The proportion of households with a monthly income above Tk 10,000 was 1.3 percent in Banaripara as compared to 4.6 percent in the sample area.     89&#13;

    This study was specially designed in the context of the widespread problem of&#13;
    arsenic contamination in rural Bangladesh to gather information on household&#13;
    perceptions about the arsenic problem. The study explores the current solutions&#13;
    being offered and assesses people's willingness to pay for arsenic-free safe&#13;
    drinking water options. It also investigates the factors that influence the demand&#13;
    for arsenic-free safe drinking water and examines household preferences among&#13;
    various arsenic mitigation technologies. The perceived advantages of piped water&#13;
    supply systems, the demand for piped water in rural areas, and whether&#13;
    households prefer such systems to other arsenic mitigation technologies are other&#13;
    issues that have been explored. The findings of the study are discussed in detail&#13;
    in the report.&#13;

     Bangladesh may be reversed. The convenience              household-level technologies in addressing arsenic&#13;
     offered by shallow tubewells will make it difficult to   contamination as the system can be managed and&#13;

&#13;
systems in rural areas is to assess the feasibility of     findings of this study that the preference for piped&#13;
&#13;
delivering these systems through alternative               water is driven more by the factor of convenience&#13;

suggests that Bangladesh has local organizations that      magnitude of the crisis that Bangladesh is currently&#13;

General instructions:&#13;
1.    The questionnaire should be filled completely.&#13;
2.    The correct boxes should be ticked to avoid ambiguity.&#13;
3.    The bullet points should be read out to the respondent to help the respondent answer the questions asked.&#13;
4.    .igures should be written in English not Bengali.&#13;
5.    In each household, the interview should be conducted with the head of the household. If the head of the&#13;
      household is not available, the interview could be conducted with a responsible adult male member of the&#13;
      family, for instance a son who is an earning member of the family. The interview should not be conducted with&#13;
      women members of the family, as far as possible, except in the case of female-headed households.&#13;

Question specific instructions to supervisors and enumerators:&#13;
(.or a number of questions detailed instructions were given to the supervisors/enumerators. The instructions for&#13;
some important questions are summarized below.)&#13;
&#13;
Water use&#13;
Question 2.1: Record the quantity of water used by the family per day for different purposes. Add the quantities used&#13;
for different purposes to get the total water consumption. This is to be filled in both kolshis (pitchers) and liters.&#13;
Indicate (at the appropriate place in the questionnaire) the size of the kolshi that the respondent is using. Ensure&#13;
consistency between the size of the kolshi indicated by you and the quantity of water reported in kolshis and liters.&#13;
.or households that use surface water sources, such as ponds and rivers, it may be difficult for the respondent to&#13;
provide information on the quantity of water used for bathing and washing. Ask the respondent what the approximate&#13;
quantity of consumption would be if they were to fetch the water in a bucket/pitcher for bathing or washing. Under&#13;
other uses, include water used for animals, gardening, etc.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Additional water requirement&#13;
     Question 2.3: Note that the figures to be recorded are the additional water consumption of the household. The&#13;
     respondent will make a judgment on how much their water consumption will go up if they could get water more&#13;
     easily. This information is to be obtained for the dry season and wet season separately.&#13;
&#13;
     Symptoms of arsenicosis&#13;
     Question 3.3: Ask the respondent to tell you about the symptoms of arsenicosis. After listening to him/her, assess&#13;
     the respondents knowledge of the symptoms. Record your assessment at the appropriate place in the questionnaire.&#13;
     Then show the respondent Card 1 and explain the symptoms of arsenicosis.&#13;
&#13;
     Health risks and treatment cost of arsenicosis&#13;
     Question 3.11: Inform the respondent correctly about the health risks and the cost of arsenicosis treatment. Use&#13;
     Card 2 (H) and then Card 2 to provide the information. (Read these cards carefully before the survey, and if there&#13;
     are questions ask your supervisor.) Do not forget to tell the respondent that once arsenicosis has reached an&#13;
     advanced stage, it cannot be cured by treatment.&#13;
&#13;
     Use of contaminated tubewells&#13;
     Question 4.17: Ask the respondent why he/she is continuing to use the tubewell when the water is known to be&#13;
     contaminated. More than one answer is possible so you may tick more than one answer.&#13;
&#13;
     Choice between household-based and community-based arsenic mitigation technologies&#13;
     Question 5.2: Note that the respondent is asked to especially consider convenience when choosing between two&#13;
     types of arsenic mitigation technologies. The cost of the technologies is not to be considered. Ask the respondent&#13;
     not to consider cost, only consider the convenience in using the technologies.&#13;
&#13;
     Ranking of the six selected arsenic mitigation technologies&#13;
     Question 5.5: In this question, the respondent is asked to make a choice between the arsenic mitigation technologies,&#13;
     taking into consideration the health risks, income, cost of technologies, etc. Show Card 9 to remind the respondent&#13;
     of the cost and other information about the technologies that were provided earlier.&#13;
&#13;
     Affordability of arsenic mitigation technology and capital subsidy&#13;
     Questions 5.7-5.10: These questions are applicable only if the respondent says that she/he is not willing to use any&#13;
     of the six arsenic mitigation technologies because he/she cannot afford them. The respondent is then asked if he/&#13;
     she would like to use any of the technologies if a 25 percent subsidy is provided on the capital cost of the technology.&#13;
     If the answer is no, ask the respondent if he/she would like to use any of the technologies if a 50 percent subsidy&#13;
     is provided on the capital cost of the technology. Note that the subsidy is only on the capital cost not on O&amp;M cost.&#13;
&#13;
     Willingness to pay for piped water&#13;
     Questions 6.5-6.15: A split sampling method will be used. You will be told by your supervisor the charges for piped&#13;
     water you will quote (out of the five set of charges listed).&#13;
&#13;
     After the closed-ended question, the respondent is asked to state what is the maximum amount he/she is willing to&#13;
     pay for capital cost. If the respondent is not willing to pay for the capital cost of the piped water scheme (or willing&#13;
     to pay only a very small amount, say Tk 50 or less), then give the respondent the option of contributing to the capital&#13;
     cost of the scheme in terms of labor.&#13;

&#13;
.ollowing the closed-ended question, the respondent is asked what is the maximum amount he/she is willing to pay&#13;
for O&amp;M cost. Since this question is not followed by a review question, ask the respondent to think carefully before&#13;
answering.&#13;
&#13;
Choice between piped water and the most preferred arsenic mitigation technology&#13;
Questions 6.16 and 6.18: Remind the respondent about the arsenic mitigation technology he/she considers to be&#13;
the best and the capital cost and O&amp;M cost of the technology. Then remind him/her of the charges for water supply&#13;
he/she has agreed to pay. Show him/her again the card for piped water systems and the card for his/her most&#13;
preferred arsenic mitigation technology. Then ask him/her to make a choice between piped water supply and the&#13;
earlier chosen arsenic mitigation technology. If the respondent says that he/she prefers a piped water supply system&#13;
to the arsenic mitigation technology, ask him/her whether he/she will choose a piped water system even if there is&#13;
80 percent capital subsidy for the arsenic mitigation technology.&#13;

Note III : Key instructions to supervisors for carrying out the survey work&#13;
&#13;
General instructions:&#13;
1.    Supervisors should ensure that the questionnaires are filled completely and according to the instructions.&#13;
2.    At the end of the day, supervisors should check the questionnaires filled by the enumerators. If a questionnaire&#13;
      is found to be incomplete, the enumerator should be asked to make a repeat visit to the house and get answers&#13;
      to the unanswered questions. The supervisor should ensure that, as far as possible, the enumerators get the&#13;
      questionnaire filled completely in the first interview, even if it means spending a little extra time, so that a&#13;
      second visit is not necessary.&#13;
3.    Supervisors should fill in the daily progress on the prescribed daily tracking sheet (see Note IV).&#13;
4.    Supervisors should inform BRAC/WSP of any problems that may arise during the field study for necessary&#13;
      advice.&#13;
5.    The supervisor will be responsible for filling up the village-level questionnaire. This should be done after the&#13;
      household-level survey has been completed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Instructions on sampling:&#13;
In each district, 800 households are to be covered in the survey. The sample is to be divided into five sub-samples,&#13;
as discussed below and in Note II. In addition, there will be a control area sample of 300 households, covering two&#13;
districts.&#13;
&#13;
.or each district, supervisors will select the villages to be covered in the survey as well as the households to be&#13;
surveyed in each village. .or each district, the thanas to be covered in the survey have already been selected by&#13;
BRAC. Villages under these thanas will be selected by random sampling. This will be based on the list of villages with&#13;
the local BRAC office.&#13;
&#13;
Within each village houses will be selected using interval-based random sampling. .or each village, the number of&#13;
households will first be ascertained. The ratio of the number of households to the number of households to be&#13;
covered will give the interval to be used for choosing houses for the survey. If, for instance, the ratio is about five,&#13;
then every sixth house will be chosen for the survey. However, if a responsible adult male member is not available for&#13;
the interview, the next house will be chosen. Any further instructions to supervisors will be given by BRAC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                           103&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     On split sampling:&#13;
     The entire sample of a district is to be divided into five sub-samples of 160 households each, and one set of charges&#13;
     for piped water is to be quoted from the five sets of charges listed in brackets for the close-ended willingness to pay&#13;
     questions.&#13;
&#13;
     Each enumerator will be informed about the set of figures to be used when conducting the survey in the sub-sample.&#13;
     He will quote that set of piped water charges for all the households in the sub-sample.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Instructions for the survey in the control area:&#13;
     .or the survey of the control area, 150 households each are to be covered in Bolarhat thana of Chapai Nawabganj&#13;
     district and Commilla Sadar thana of Commilla district.&#13;
&#13;
     When the survey is undertaken in the control area, the following questions are not to be asked:&#13;
&#13;
     !   Section 5 entirely (questions on arsenic mitigation technologies); and&#13;
&#13;
     !   Questions 6.16-6.18 (questions on choice between piped water and arsenic mitigation technologies).&#13;
&#13;
     These questions should be scored out from the questionnaire before starting the survey in the control area to avoid&#13;
     confusion at the time of the interview.&#13;

    et al. (2002). The multinomial logit model has also found wide application in contingent valuation studies undertaken in other contexts. See, for&#13;
    instance, Mc.adden (1976). It has been suggested that, in some cases, it may be more appropriate to call the applied model the conditional logit&#13;
    model rather than the multinomial logit model (see Greene, 2000).&#13;

         50In 2001-02 when the survey was conducted, the rate of interest on deposits for two years or more with major banks in Bangladesh was 8 to 9 per&#13;
         cent per annum. The interest rate for agricultural lending in such banks was between 12 to 16 percent per annum. The mid point of the range of&#13;
         interest rates, that is, 12 percent per annum, was used to convert one-time capital cost payment into an equivalent monthly payment. Arguably, the&#13;
         correct interest rate to apply would vary among households depending on their financial position and whether they would pay the initial capital cost out&#13;
         of their savings or would have to borrow money for this purpose. However, due to lack of data, this modification could not be introduced in the&#13;

        example, in the BRAC Narayanganj project, the                                        semi-government agency.&#13;
        capital cost per connection is about Tk 17,000,&#13;
        which is expected to reduce to Tk 5,600 when                                      This provides a conservative estimate of the capital&#13;
        there is full design capacity utilization.                                   cost to pump and supply piped water. However, one&#13;

        water supply in rural Bangladesh is to compare&#13;
        these estimates with peoples willingness to pay                              non-grid power supply. This would mean an&#13;
&#13;
        and analyze issues connected with cost recovery.                             investment in non-grid power systems. .or a piped&#13;

        .rom this point of view, it would be better to take                          water supply scheme serving 200 households, a non-&#13;
&#13;
        a conservative cost estimate because if the                                  grid power supply based on diesel would require an&#13;
&#13;
        analysis indicates adequate cost recovery for                                additional investment of about Tk 500,000. Thus, the&#13;
&#13;
        such cost estimates, this will also be true for                              additional investment per household would be about&#13;
&#13;
        lower cost of piped water supply.                                            Tk 2,500. This figure has been included to obtain a&#13;
                                                                                     final estimate of the capital cost of piped water supply.&#13;
    Another point to be noted in this context is that the&#13;
estimates shown in Table C.1 are based on the                                             Similarly, to estimate O&amp;M cost, maximum&#13;
&#13;
assumption of full design capacity utilization.                                      indicated range has been taken for a conservative&#13;

However, if the utilization remains limited to 80                                    cost estimate.&#13;

percent, which is more reasonable to expect, then the                                     The capital and O&amp;M cost estimates for a&#13;
cost per connection would probably be higher by                                      domestic piped water connection finally used for the&#13;
about 20 to 25 percent.                                                              study are shown in Table C.2.&#13;

about Tk 5/month. The same difference is maintained in the cost estimates finally chosen.                                                          111&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
           The cost estimates shown in Table C.2 can be                        applied for capital cost. However, it may be noted that&#13;
       applied to households opting for a domestic connec-                     many important capital cost items, such as the size of&#13;
       tion. The estimates for households opting for                           the tank and the capacity of the pump, are related to&#13;
       standposts should be lower as it is expected that five                  the volume of water supplied. Therefore, the appor-&#13;
       families would share a connection. How much lower                       tioning of these cost among the beneficiary house-&#13;
       the cost of standposts will be compared to private                      holds should be done according to the quantity of&#13;
       connections will depend on the quantity of water used.                  water consumed.&#13;
       In some rural water supply projects in India the norms                       At the same time, it needs to be recognized that&#13;
       used are 40 lpcd for households using a shared                          shared connections (standposts) would give rise to&#13;
       connection and 70 lpcd for households using a                           some cost saving with respect to the cost of the piped&#13;
       domestic connection. It would not be wrong to use this                  network. It seems reasonable, therefore, to assume&#13;
       ratio for the piped water supply project in rural                       that the capital cost of a standpost would be 50&#13;
       Bangladesh. Based on these figures, the O&amp;M cost for                    percent of the capital cost of a domestic connection.&#13;

&#13;
To estimate the value of arsenic-free water by the       expenditure was incurred by households in operating&#13;
revealed preference approach, the following four         and maintaining the equipment.&#13;
components were valued and aggregated:&#13;
&#13;
1.    How many people have shifted their drinking       Cost of extra time spent to collect&#13;
      water source as a result of arsenic               drinking water&#13;
      contamination, and are now spending more time      The most important element of cost as a result of&#13;
      collecting drinking water? What is the value of    households changing their water source due to&#13;
      the extra time being spent?                        arsenic contamination was the extra time spent to&#13;
&#13;
2.    How many people have shifted from tubewells to     collect drinking water. About 21 percent of the&#13;
&#13;
      surface water sources such as tanks and ponds,     households in the sample area had changed their&#13;
&#13;
      and are boiling water to remove bacteriological    drinking water source in the previous three years due&#13;
&#13;
      contamination? What is the value of time spent     to arsenic contamination of the earlier source. The&#13;
&#13;
      and fuel used in boiling water?                    distance that these households now travel to collect&#13;

3.    How many people had to install a new tubewell,     Consequently, the time spent has also increased from&#13;
      or sink the existing tubewells deeper, because     9 minutes to 27 minutes a day. The valuation of the&#13;

      expenditure incurred?                              who generally collects drinking water for the family).&#13;
4.    How many households had to purchase arsenic            The average wage rate was about Tk 70 per day&#13;

            Fighting arsenic : listening to rural
            communities - willingness to pay for arsenic-free, safe
            drinking water in Bangladesh
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            During the last couple of decades, the
            efforts of the Government, Nongovernmental organizations,
            and donor agencies have succeeded in creating a "water
            miracle" in Bangladesh. A combination of three
            important factors has enabled over 95 percent of rural
            households to access clean, drinking water through
            tube-wells: the shallow water aquifers of the country, a
            sustained public sector campaign encouraging people to shift
            from pathogen-contaminated surface water to ground sources,
            and the introduction of hand-pump technology. The shallow
            tube-well technology, purchased directly by households from
            the market, created perhaps the largest
            private-sector-supported safe drinking water program in
            South Asia, if not the developing world. However, the
            contamination of shallow aquifers with arsenic may well be
            threatening to undo this success, indicating between 30-40
            million people are potentially at risk of arsenic poisoning
            from drinking water sources in Bangladesh. This study has
            been designed to assess and analyze people's
            perceptions on the extent of arsenic problem, and possible
            solutions. It uses a contingent valuation methodology to
            assess household preferences, and willingness to pay for
            arsenic-free drinking water. Findings suggest that while the
            majority of people were aware of the arsenic problem,
            awareness levels about the likely effects on their health
            were found to be low; and, surveys reflect a marked
            inter-district variation in the level of contamination.
            Preferences between arsenic mitigation technologies and
            piped water systems were surveyed, suggesting demand for
            piped water in arsenic-affected areas with access to deep
            tube-wells, show that households were willing to share the
            cost of piped water schemes. The field study findings offer
            insights for policy makers to evolve a framework to address
            the arsenic crisis, and, the study raises a number of issues
            that may guide future research.
