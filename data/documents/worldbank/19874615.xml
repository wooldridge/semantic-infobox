Report of the Committee under Section 4 (iii) of Article III of the Articles of Agreement on the&#13;
proposed Loan (First Capital Market Development and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise&#13;
Finance Development Policy Loan) to the Kingdom of Morocco&#13;
The undersigned Committee constituted under Section 7 of Article V of the Articles of Agreement of&#13;
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) hereby submits its report pursuant to&#13;
Section 4 (iii) of Article III of said Articles in respect of the proposal that the Bank grants to the Kingdom&#13;
of Morocco a loan in an amount of E217,600,000. The purposes of said loan are to: (i) deepen capital&#13;
markets by broadening the range of instruments and investors; (ii) initiate reform of the pension system;&#13;
(iii) foster solutions for the financing of small and young firms; and (iv) consolidate oversight to balance&#13;
greater access with continued financial stability.&#13;
1.     The Committee has carefully studied the merits of the proposal to grant such a loan, and of the&#13;
purpose to which the proceeds of the loan are to be applied.&#13;
2.     The Committee is of the opinion that the program in support of which the proceeds of such loan&#13;
are to be applied comes within the purposes of the Bank as set forth in Article I of said Articles of&#13;
Agreement, and that said program is designed to promote the development of the productive facilities and&#13;
resources of the Kingdom of Morocco and is in the interest of the Kingdom of Morocco and of the&#13;
members of the Bank as a whole.&#13;
3.     Accordingly, the Committee finds that said program merits financial assistance from the Bank,&#13;
and hereby recommends said program for such assistance.&#13;
