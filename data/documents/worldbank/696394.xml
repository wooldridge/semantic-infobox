EMERGENCY DEMOBILIZATION AND REINTEGRATION PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.           Demobilization is one of the basic requirements of the Dayton Agreement. But there&#13;
is widespread concern that a large injection of former soldiers into the economy could threaten peace&#13;
and recovery unless ways are found to expedite their reintegration. Contacts with officials of the&#13;
Federation Ministry of Defense indicate that there will be approximately 245,000 military personnel&#13;
demobilized, 65,000 from the Bosnia Croat Army (HVO) and 180 from the Bosnian Army of the&#13;
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina (ARHB). The average age is 20-35 and the population is almost&#13;
entirely male; 18% are officers and 85% are married. About 25% have some higher education, while&#13;
the majority of the remainder have completed secondary education. In the Republika Srpska (RS), a&#13;
total of 180,000 soldiers will be demobilized; 85% of these are married, 20% have a university&#13;
degree, and the remainder have secondary school or less. The age range is between 25 and 40 years.&#13;
2.           Demobilization is being carried out in phases according to the Dayton Agreement.&#13;
The initial phase emphasizes (i) demobilization of soldiers who had the opportunity to return to their&#13;
initial place of residence and employment, and (ii) those who were returning to complete their&#13;
education which was disrupted by the conflict. By April 30, 1996, 100,000 ARHB and 45,000 HVO&#13;
soldiers were demobilized, with the remainder expected by June 30. By April 14, 1996, a total of&#13;
150,000 RS soldiers were demobilized, with the remainder expected by June 15. These latter phases&#13;
will involve demobilization of soldiers who may have greater difficulty with reintegration because&#13;
they are not able to return to their homes and previous jobs.-' There is some evidence that a&#13;
significant portion of these may have lower general education and professional qualifications, or&#13;
qualifications that are not matched to the economic environment where they are now located. In&#13;
addition, some of these individuals have injuries which prevent them from resuming their former&#13;
occupation. If not given appropriate assistance in the near future, a large portion of demobilized&#13;
military will end up among the ranks of the long-term structurally unemployed who will require long-&#13;
term income support.&#13;
3.           In addition to the reintegration of demobilized soldiers, there are, according to the&#13;
latest statistical figures presented by the Government, an estimated 1,250,000 refugees who are&#13;
expected to return to BH. Like the demobilized soldiers, many may be unable to return to their&#13;
original home and place of work and will likely also join the ranks of the unemployed. In addition to&#13;
these, many of the 900,000 people employed in the civilian economy in 1991 are now unemployed&#13;
because they were displaced by the conflict, or due to the fact that their place of employment is&#13;
damaged and/or working at a reduced capacity.- Other smaller, but significant, groups of individuals&#13;
who may need assistance to return to work are the disabled and widows of soldiers killed in the&#13;
For example, about 30,000 of the 160,000 HVO Croats who were displaced from Central Bosnia during Lhe war are&#13;
not expected to return to their former homes. In the RS there are about 70,000 soldiers who are displaced without&#13;
homes or jobs.&#13;
2/    It is estimated that only about 72.000 were able to keep their jobs during the conflict.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
conflict. The disabled will need training for alternative employment, and many widows are faced&#13;
with the necessity of entering the workforce to support dependents without appropriate qualifications.&#13;
4.            Employment and job creation is driven by reconstruction as well as by economic&#13;
restructuring and privatization. Reconstruction expenditures alone. estimated at over US$5 billion&#13;
during 1996-1999. will generate considerable short-term and medium-term employment for skilled&#13;
and unskilled workers. But there may be a mismatch between the supply and demand for labor.&#13;
Many demobilized soldiers with skills and experience can and will be involved in the reconstruction&#13;
effort. However, even at this early stage of reconstruction, skill shortages are appearing. Economic&#13;
restructuring will likely exacerbate the mismatch of skills for demobilized soldiers and other groups&#13;
described in paragraph 3.&#13;
5.            A reintegration strategy is needed to assist individuals who are not spontaneously&#13;
drawn into reconstruction-related employment, to help them find-jobs in the changing labor market --&#13;
including training and other support to help them start small businesses. This strategy must be&#13;
flexible in order to address the varying needs of the individuals, as well as the communities in which&#13;
they reside. The strategy should include: (a) provision of counseling and job-placement services, (b)&#13;
support for small business creation, including access to credit, (c) support for education and retraining&#13;
to adjust job seekers' qualifications to labor-market needs, (d) support for transitional temporary&#13;
employment through public works and public service employment, and (e) temporary income&#13;
support/cash benefits. Not all individuals will need assistance, and no one program can solve all&#13;
problems.&#13;
6.            The reconstruction program for Bosnia, supported by the Bank and other donors,&#13;
includes initiatives which address many of these needs. The Economic Recovery Project (ERP)&#13;
provides cash assistance for which many demobilized soldiers and their families will be eligible, and&#13;
credit for businesses, including small business start-ups. The several emergency investment projects&#13;
(for farm reconstruction, water supply, transport, district heating, war victims and education) will all&#13;
generate employment opportunities, as will the second-wave investment operations focussed on&#13;
infrastructure rehabilitation or reconstruction. A proposed Local Initiatives Project and Public Works&#13;
and Employment Project are under preparation by the Bank, both designed expressly to put people&#13;
back to work. While none of these projects is targeted specifically to demobilized soldiers, all&#13;
include former soldiers among their target groups. The only elements of the strategy not so far&#13;
explicitly and systematically addressed are the need for employment counseling, and for education and&#13;
retraining to adjust skills to market needs. The proposed Demobilization and Reintegration Project&#13;
would address this need.&#13;
B. IBRD/IDA Assistance Strategy&#13;
7.            Demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants is one of the highest priorities for&#13;
the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina for security, humanitarian, and economic reasons.&#13;
However, this urgent short-term issue must be looked at in the context of related issues including the&#13;
large numbers of refugees which must also be reintegrated into the economy, as well as medium term&#13;
challenges which include rebuilding the basic institutions necessary to operate a modem democratic&#13;
market economy. These short and medium term issues have been taken into account in the design of&#13;
the proposed project. First, steps have been taken to involve the major social partners in the&#13;
reintegration process. This has been done through creation of Employment and Training Foundations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
(ETFs) to manage the project. Members include local government agencies, chambers of commerce,&#13;
and labor representatives. This implementation format will encourage the transfer of responsibility&#13;
from defense to civilian authorities, as well as provide an opportunity to strengthen social dialogue.&#13;
Second, the ETF framework will provide financing to local service providers, including NGOs, which&#13;
will provide services to demobilized soldiers. This support will also help local education and training&#13;
providers rebuild their capacity for medium-term support to the economy. Third, the ETFs provide a&#13;
framework which other Bank-financed projects (e.g. the Public Employment Project) and other donors&#13;
(e.g the European Union which has expressed support for the concept) can use to increase the flow of&#13;
resources to assist with reintegration of ex-combatants and refugees.&#13;
C. Detailed Project Description&#13;
8.           The overall objective of the proposed project is to assist economic reintegration of&#13;
displaced workers into the civilian workforce in order to reduce the burden on families, decrease&#13;
dependency on eventual social assistance, and increase economic productivity. The primary target&#13;
group is demobilized soldiers. Secondary target groups include refugees, war victims and the&#13;
disabled, widows, and the general unemployed.&#13;
9.           The project would finance, in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the&#13;
Republika Srpska, implementation of: improved labor market information data bases, counseling and&#13;
job-finding services, education and retraining services, and management support units to assist the&#13;
Employment and Training Foundations (ETFs) which are to be responsible for implementation&#13;
management in the Federation and the Republika Srpska. Each of these components is described&#13;
below:&#13;
(a)    Labor Market Information Data Base (US$1.5 million): The project would finance&#13;
automation hardware, software, and limited technical assistance and training to&#13;
re-establish, upgrade and broaden the labor market information data base operated by&#13;
Municipal Employment Services which have been severely disrupted by the conflict.&#13;
The previous job vacancy systems would be broadened, through cooperation with the&#13;
Reconstruction Agencies, to include qualitative and quantitative information on&#13;
reconstruction programs to assist with out-placement activities. The job seeker&#13;
registration systems would also be modified and broadened, in cooperation with the&#13;
Ministries of Defence, to include specialized information on the characteristics and&#13;
background of demobilized soldiers which may be useful during counseling and job-&#13;
placement activities. Summaries of this information would be available from the&#13;
Employment Service, in automated and newsletter formats, to agencies responsible for&#13;
organizing services (e.g. counseling, retraining, small business assistance, public&#13;
works) for demobilized soldiers and displaced workers.&#13;
(b)    Counseling and Job-Finding Services (US$1.8 million): The project would finance&#13;
limited technical assistance to develop counseling and job-finding services, and sub-&#13;
project contracts for delivery of counseling and job-finding services targeted&#13;
principally to demobilized soldiers, according to criteria and procedures agreed with&#13;
IDA (Appendix 2). Sub-projects for delivery of counseling and training services&#13;
would be contacted with Municipal Employment Services and/or private or Non-&#13;
Government Organizations (NGOs), and would utilize the previously described Labor&#13;
Market Information Data Base. Services may include (but are not be limited to):&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
family and social counseling, job search assistance, screening of individuals for&#13;
trauma counseling (possibly at the centers being financed under the War Victims&#13;
Rehabilitation Project), screening of individuals for participation in follow-up labor&#13;
adjustment activities (e.g., retraining, public works, small business assistance), and&#13;
provision of information on legal rights and responsibilities in civilian life.&#13;
(c)     Education and Retraining Services (US$ 16.0 million): The project would finance&#13;
sub-project contracts for demand-driven education and retraining services&#13;
(including small business training) primarily to demobilized soldiers in accordance&#13;
with criteria and procedures agreed with IDA (see Appendix 2). These contractual&#13;
services could include the provision of education and training resources to: (i)&#13;
enterprises which agree to provide on-job-training services to the unemployed; and&#13;
(ii) education and training institutions which provide short-term retraining&#13;
programs. Services would be demand driven and primarily provided through group&#13;
training contracts with enterprises and training institutions. Contracts would include&#13;
pre-negotiated levels of job placement at the end of training, and would contain&#13;
financial incentives and disincentives to reinforce job placement targets. In addition to&#13;
group training programs, a voucher program would also be made available to allow&#13;
individuals to enter ongoing institutional training programs, including assisting them&#13;
to complete advanced secondary or post-secondary formal education which was&#13;
disrupted by the war. The total estimated cost of this component is based on the&#13;
assumption that approximately 32,000 individuals receive education or training under&#13;
the project, at an average unit cost of US$500. This figure is based on experience in&#13;
the region, and conditions in BH. If all beneficiaries were demobilized soldiers, the&#13;
project would reach about 8%  of all demobilized soldiers.3'&#13;
(d)     Management Assistance (US$0.7 million): The project would finance technical&#13;
assistance and goods to develop and maintain two small Management Units, one in the&#13;
Federation and one in the RS. These would consist of approximately 3-5 staff each,&#13;
plus one extension officer in each Canton or Region (about five in the RS and 10 in&#13;
the Federation) and would promote, oversee, and monitor the local counseling and&#13;
retraining service contracts. These units would also coordinate all procurement&#13;
financed under the project and act as a liaison to the Bank, through the respective&#13;
Ministries of Finance, for supervision and reporting purposes.&#13;
The region has considerable experience with demand-driven tmning contracts (e.g. Albania, Turkey, FYR&#13;
Macedonia). Placement and retention rates after training exceed 75% in on-the-job-training and are about 50%&#13;
following institutional training, even under the difficult economic condilions in Albania and Macedonia. Typical&#13;
training subprojects are in the service and production sectors. and include such activities as shoe making, crafts, metal&#13;
fabrication, electrical manufacturing, newspapers, construction. food service, crafts, a broad array of hotel services,&#13;
hair dressing, textiles, and auto repair. Many involve small-and-medium-sized enterprises which are formed&#13;
following restructuring of large public enterprises. On-the-job-raining organized by enterprises -- either alone, or in&#13;
partnership with training institutions -- is often an important means of raising worker productivity.&#13;

Project Costs and Financing Plan&#13;
10.            Project Costs. The total cost of the Demobilization and Reintegration Project is&#13;
estimated at US$20.0 million. No price or physical contingencies have been included, given the&#13;
expected short disbursement period of this project and the variable scale of the largest project&#13;
components. The project is expected to disburse over a 24 month implementation period. Project&#13;
costs are summarized in the table below, and presented in more detail in Appendix 1.&#13;

11.            Financing Plan. Of the total cost project cost of US$20.0 million, US$7.5 million is&#13;
proposed as an IDA Credit. IDA funds would finance approved project inputs, net of taxes. Two-&#13;
thirds of total financing for the project would be allocated to project activities in the Federation, and&#13;
one-third to project activities in the Republika Srpska. Within the Federation, resources would be&#13;
distributed roughly in accordance with population. Cofinancing from the Dutch Government (US$0.4&#13;
million) has already been identified. Additional cofinancing of US$12.1 million is being sought to&#13;
meet the remaining financing gap. If financing is not found to fill this gap, the first three components&#13;
(labor market information, and sub-projects for counseling services and retraining services) would be&#13;
scaled back in accordance with available resources.&#13;

12.             Retroactive Financing. Although little capacity exits in the Federation or RS to&#13;
pre-finance activities, the possibility of retroactive financing should not be excluded -- particularly,&#13;
for the Federation, where early start-up is most likely. Therefore, retroactive financing will be&#13;
permitted up to the limit of 10% of the amount of the proposed Credit preallocated respectively to the&#13;
Federation for eligible expenses incurred after May 3, 1996 (but not more than four months prior to&#13;
signing) for TA for management support to the ETF and for initial counseling and retraining service&#13;
contracts.&#13;
Environmental Aspects&#13;
13.                Because the project is not expected to have any adverse environmental impact, it is&#13;
proposed for classification under Environmental Category C.&#13;
D. Institutional Arrangements and Implementation&#13;
Project Organization and Implementation&#13;
14.              The Project would be implemented over a maximum  of 24 months by two&#13;
Employment and Training Foundations (ETFs), established by the Federation Ministry of Finance and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the RS Ministry of Finance. The Federation ETF would be supported by external and local technical&#13;
assistance funding through a Dutch Government Trust Fund, while credit funds or other donor&#13;
support would be used to support the technical assistance for the RS. Responsibility for project&#13;
implementation, including responsibility for awarding education and training contracts. would be&#13;
delegated by the State Ministry of Finance to the Federation and RS Ministries of Finance, and on&#13;
(through subsidiary financing and project implementation agreements) to the respective Employment&#13;
and Training Foundations, which would contract for and oversee project implementation on behalf of&#13;
the respective Ministries of Finance. A summary of institutional arrangements is included in&#13;
Appendix 5. Key activities and roles are as follows:&#13;
(a)    The two ETFs would be established as non-profit foundations by the Federation and&#13;
RS Ministries of Finance, with terms of reference agreed with IDA. (See the proposed&#13;
ETF Charter in Appendix 3). Each ETF would have a Board of Trustees composed&#13;
of representatives from, but not limited to, the respective Federation and RS&#13;
Ministries of Finance, Ministries of Defense, Ministries of Refugees and Social&#13;
Affairs/Employment Institutes, Ministries of Education, Chambers of Commerce. and&#13;
trade unions 4/. Each project implemented under the respective ETFs, including this&#13;
proposed Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project, would have a single&#13;
Executive Director, approved by the ETF's Board of Trustees, with signatory&#13;
authority for expenditures under the project. The ETF Boards would review and&#13;
approve ETF policies, regulations, and major service delivery contracts (over&#13;
US$25,000), upon the recommendation of the Cantonal Steering Committees (para.&#13;
14d). Each project implemented under the respective ETFs, including this proposed&#13;
Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project, would have an Executive&#13;
Committee, chaired by the Executive Director for the project. The Executive&#13;
Committee for this project would also comprise the Financial Director of the project,&#13;
and two members of the Board appointed by the Executive Director on a rotating&#13;
basis. The Executive Committee of the ETF for the proposed project would review&#13;
and approve all service delivery contracts up to $25,000. Each project implemented&#13;
by the respective ETFs, including this project, would have a secretariat to carry out&#13;
the operational requirements of implementation. As shown in Appendix 5, this&#13;
project is to be implemented by the Training Department in each of the ETFs; its&#13;
Executive Director is to be the secretary for implementation of the project; the Public&#13;
Works Departments are to be the secretariat for the proposed Emergency Public&#13;
Works and Employment Project.&#13;
(b)    The Federation and RS Ministries of Finance would initiate the establishment of the&#13;
ETFs and would serve as members of the ETF Boards, with equal voting rights as&#13;
other members.&#13;
(c)    With resources from the IDA Credit (and potentially other financiers), the ETFs&#13;
would contract for counseling and retraining services under approved sub-projects.&#13;
The ETFs would pay for the services delivered based on criteria and procedures&#13;
agreed with IDA (Appendix 2), including: (i) the type of counseling and retraining&#13;
4/    In the Federation there would be two representatives from each agency; each agency would have only one consensus&#13;
vote.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8 -&#13;
services to be provided, (ii) the agencies eligible to provide these services, and (iii)&#13;
eligible costs to be reimbursed under service contracts.&#13;
(d)    The ETFs would have an extension staff member working in each canton, who would&#13;
work with local service providers to develop and monitor implementation of&#13;
counseling and retraining service contracts, following criteria and procedures agreed&#13;
with IDA. All proposals would be reviewed by Cantonal Steering Committees. In&#13;
each canton, the ETF extension agent would serve as the secretariat to the Cantonal&#13;
Steering Committee. The extension agent would nominate a Cantonal Steering&#13;
Committee for approval by the appropriate ETF Board. In addition, each Cantonal&#13;
Steering Committee would include a representative appointed by the main municipality&#13;
of the canton. The Cantonal Steering Committees would review all proposals for&#13;
counseling and retraining services. For proposals which pass this first stage of&#13;
review, the ETF extension agent would forward them to the ETF Executive&#13;
Committee with a recommendation for approval. Proposals in excess of $25,000&#13;
would need to be approved by the full ETF Board.&#13;
(e)    ETFs would reimburse local counseling and retraining contractors on a monthly basis&#13;
against invoices submitted by the contractor, and on the basis of agreed unit costs as&#13;
stipulated in the contracts. The ETFs may provide mobilization payments to sub-&#13;
project contractors, as agreed with IDA.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
15.          Procurement arrangements are summarized in table 5, below. As recommended by&#13;
the Bosnia Procurement Advisory Committee, packages will be procured mainly through International&#13;
Shopping (IS), National Shopping (NS) and Direct Contracting (DC).&#13;

Goods&#13;
16.             Advertising. A General Procurement Notice (GPN) (Appendix 4) will be published&#13;
in DeveloDment Business in June, 1996. The notice would include information about the nature of&#13;
the goods, and services to be procured, and invite interested and eligible suppliers, contractors and&#13;
consultants to send their expression of interest to the ETFs.&#13;
17.             ICB/LIB. It is not envisaged that ICB or LIB procedures will be utilized for the&#13;
procurement of goods or services, since no single contract will exceed US$2.0 million equivalent.&#13;
18.             International Shopping (IS). Procedures for IS will be used for equipment and&#13;
materials or standard-specification commodities estimated to cost between US$200,000 and US$2.0&#13;
million per contract. IS will be based on comparing price quotations obtained from at least three&#13;
suppliers from two eligible countries, in accordance with Bank guidelines. IS is expected to be used&#13;
primarily for computer and vehicles procurement under the project.&#13;
19.             National Shopping (NS). NS will be used for contracts for goods available in Bosnia&#13;
Herzegovina up to an estimated cost US$200,000 per contract, with at least three quotations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
20.          Direct Contracting (DC). DC will be used for proprietary items. for reasons of&#13;
compatibility and standardization. and in any other justified case. Any direct contracting during&#13;
project implementation will require prior Bank approval.&#13;
Services&#13;
21.          Services will be procured through competition and sole-sourcing where and when&#13;
appropriate. Qualified firms have been invited to submit proposals for a comprehensive package of&#13;
consultant services to management the Federation ETF, in accordance with the "Guidelines for the&#13;
Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by The World Bank as Executing Agency" (August&#13;
1981). These proposals are currently under review by the Federation ETF.&#13;
22.          Job Counseling and Training Service Contracts. Individual sub-project contracts&#13;
for job counseling and training services are not expected to exceed US$50,000. Contracts would be&#13;
awarded by the ETF, principally on a sole-source basis according to the following procedure:&#13;
(a)    Local ETF extension agents would publicize the availability of funds for counseling&#13;
and retraining, and help potential service providers prepare proposals using standard&#13;
proposal formats -- readily convertible into service-delivery contracts -- to be&#13;
developed by the ETF in conformity with criteria and procedures agreed with the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
(b)    Local ETF extension agents would convene the Cantonal Steering Committee to&#13;
review and comment on the service proposals. For proposals which pass this first&#13;
stage of review, the ETF extension agent would forward them to the ETF Executive&#13;
Committee with a recommendation for approval.&#13;
(c)    The ETF Executive Committee would review all proposals submitted by the ETF&#13;
extension agents. It would approve proposals up to US$25,000 in value, and would&#13;
forward proposals above that amount to the full ETF Board for approval. The ETF&#13;
secretariat would convert approved proposals into contracts for signature and&#13;
execution. Actual implementation of the contracts would be managed by the Training&#13;
Department of the respective ETFs.&#13;
(d)    Local training and counseling service providers would invoice the ETF on a monthly&#13;
basis for services provided in conformity with their training or counseling sub-project&#13;
contract.&#13;
(e)    The ETF would review invoices and initiate payment from the respective Special&#13;
Account (paragraph 27) through a correspondent bank in BH, to the service provider.&#13;
If agreed, the ETF could provide a mobilization payment of up to 25% of total&#13;
contract value to service providers.&#13;
(f)    The State Ministry of Finance would request replenishment of the Special Accounts&#13;
based on requests from the ETFs, documented with SOEs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-Ill -&#13;
Procurement Review Committee&#13;
23.          The Governrnent plans to establish a generic Procurement Review Committee to&#13;
review procurement under all Bank-financed reconstruction projects. Procuremen under the proposed&#13;
Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project would be subject to audit by this Committee.&#13;
Procurement Implementation Capacity&#13;
24.          Because the Borrower is likely to be short of the capacity for timely implementation in&#13;
various areas, including procurement of goods and services, technical assistance will be provided&#13;
under the ETF management support contract to help facilitate project implementation. In addition,&#13;
procurement under the project will be supported by a World Bank Operations Officer and a&#13;
Procurement Officer located at the World Bank's Bosnia Resident Mission in Sarajevo.&#13;
Prior and Post Bank Review of Procurement Documents&#13;
25.          The Bank has prepared the invitation to quote and contract documents for International&#13;
Shopping, as well as a National Shopping document for goods. These documents would be used&#13;
under the project. Prior review will be required for all contracts procured through IS and Direct&#13;
Contracting (DC). For consultants' contracts, the Bank's standard form for consultants contracts&#13;
would be used. Ex-post review by IDA would be performed for institutional consultant contracts of&#13;
less than $100,000 and of individual consultant contracts of less than $50,000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Disbursements&#13;
26.          Disbursement categories under the Credit are shown in Table 6 below. The project&#13;
is expected to be disbursed over a period of 24 months from the date of effectiveness, scheduled for&#13;
July 1996. The closing date will be January 31. 1999. Retroactive financing will be permitted up to&#13;
the limit of 10% of the amount of the proposed Credit preallocated to the Federation for eligible&#13;
expenses incurred after May 3, 1996 (but not more than four months prior to signing) for TA for&#13;
management support to the Federation ETF and for initial counseling and retraining service contracts&#13;
in the Federation.&#13;

27.          Special Account. To facilitate timely project implementation, payments for agreed&#13;
project actions are to be made from two Special Accounts in US dollars which are to be established&#13;
and maintained by the State Ministry of Finance at a bank acceptable to IDA. The State Ministry of&#13;
Finance would designate the individuals with authority to sign withdrawal applications for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
disbursements from the respective Special Accounts. For the Federation Special Account, this would&#13;
initially include a representative of the Federation Ministry of Finance, the Chairman of the&#13;
Federation ETF, or the Executive Director of the Training Department of the ETF. The authorized&#13;
allocation of the Federation and RS Special Accounts would be limited to DM 1,300,000 and DM&#13;
700,000 respectively, representing about four months of estimated average expenditures expected to&#13;
be paid from the Special Accounts. Replenishment applications would be forwarded to the Bank on a&#13;
monthly basis, and must include reconciled bank statements as well as other appropriate documents.&#13;
28.          Statement of Expenditures. Disbursements would be made against Statements of&#13;
Expenditures (SOEs) for: a) goods contracts up to US$2.0 million equivalent (with the exception of&#13;
the first three contracts less than USS2.0 million), consulting firms and individuals up to US$100,000&#13;
and US$50,000. respectively, and all job counselling and training. Detailed documents evidencing&#13;
expenditures would be maintained in a central location by ETF Management and made available for&#13;
the required audit as well as Bank supervision missions. Each of the ETFs would request&#13;
replenishment of its Special Account based on SOEs. No contracts under the project are expected to&#13;
exceed US$1.0 million equivalent. The project completion date would be July 31, 1998.&#13;
Project Audits, Accounting and Reporting&#13;
29.          Accounts. Separate and auditable accounts would be established by the management&#13;
of each ETF. These accounts would include: (i) a record of withdrawals with copies of all&#13;
disbursement requests and underlying documentation; (ii) a record of transactions on the special&#13;
account and the copies of the bank statements on this account; and (iii) a record of transactions under&#13;
the ETFs.&#13;
30.          Audits. The project accounts, including the ETFs, would be audited annually by&#13;
independent auditors and under terms and reference acceptable to the Bank. Separate audit statements&#13;
would be prepared for the ETFs, the Special Accounts and for Statements of Expenditures. All audit&#13;
reports would be made available to the Bank at the latest six month after the end of the fiscal year.&#13;
All project accounts would be maintained for one year after they have been audited.&#13;
31.          Reporting. The management of each ETF will prepare and furnish to the Bank a&#13;
quarterly progress report showing the status of implementation of the project as well as a financial&#13;
report in a format acceptable to the Bank. The format of the report would be agreed during&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
Supervision Plan&#13;
32.           Project implementation will require a large degree of flexibility in view of the rapidly&#13;
changing circumstances in the country. Implementation progress would be formally evaluated at&#13;
mid-term, approximately nine months after effectiveness. In addition, to facilitate flexibility and rapid&#13;
decision making, social sectors Bank staff located in the World Bank Resident Mission in Sarajevo&#13;
and in the Human Resources Hub in Budapest would provide intensive supervision of all initial&#13;
project implementation steps, and would provide technical assistance on matters requiring rapid&#13;
decision by the Bank. In particular, procurement and disbursement issues would require intensive&#13;
supervision, given the flexibilities built into the implementation plan, and the lack of familiarity of the&#13;
Borrower with Bank procedures and practices. A Project launch workshop is planned as soon as the&#13;
related Technical Assistance Contract is finalized and initial staff are in place. It is expected that an&#13;
average of 25 staff weeks per year will be needed to supervise the Project; it is anticipated that this&#13;
will be provided primarily by staff from the Resident Mission and Hungary Human Resource&#13;
Operations Hub.&#13;

Bosnia and Herzegovina&#13;
Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project&#13;
Principles and Criteria for Use of Funds&#13;
by the Employment and Training Foundation&#13;
General Principles:&#13;
The following principles apply to contracts that will be let between the ETFs and local service&#13;
providers to deliver counseling and retraining services to demobilized soldiers and other categories&#13;
of workers and, unless otherwise agreed with the IDA, will be the basis on which the IDA reimburses&#13;
the Employment and Training Foundations for expenses incurred.&#13;
(a)    Eligible individuals: During the first six months of project effectiveness a minimum of 80%&#13;
of ETF Fund resources for counseling and retraining services will be reserved for assisting&#13;
demobilized soldiers, after the first six months a minimum of 65% will be reserved for demobilized&#13;
soldiers, with the remainder being made available to help other categories of the unemployed who are&#13;
registered at the Employment Services (e.g. war victims and disabled, widows, refugees, and the&#13;
general unemployed). Individuals receiving income support stipends from sources outside the project&#13;
would receive reduced stipends under the project to maintain equity.&#13;
(b)    Demand: Service contracts would be demand driven: developed at the local level, and based&#13;
on requests from demobilized soldiers for skills requalification, and on consultation with the social&#13;
partners (the Canton Steering Committees) to confirm labor market demand.&#13;
(c)    Costs of services: Reimbursement to local service contractors would be based on the average&#13;
unit cost of providing services to an individual times the number of individuals actually completing&#13;
the program. Payments to service providers would be monthly, and would be based on invoices&#13;
presented for services provided, less a per-trainee deduction for dropouts. Mobilization payments, to&#13;
a maximum of 25% of the contract, would be allowed. Two-thirds of resources would be available to&#13;
the Federation (with internal distribution between communities roughly based on population and&#13;
demand) and one-third to the Republika Srpska.&#13;
(d)    Evaluation of services: Service providers would be required to provide job placement&#13;
information for all participants who receive services. (See special note on follow-up requirements on&#13;
retraining services on the following page).&#13;
(e)    Mobility: Labor mobility among participants would be encouraged under the project. To&#13;
support this initiative, the ETFs would collect and disseminate information on training and counseling&#13;
services available under the project. The Labor Market Information Component, in cooperation with&#13;
the ETFs, would include information on Federation job vacancies, reconstruction programs, and&#13;
retraining opportunities. The Fund could support relocation costs for individuals to move to localities&#13;
where suitable jobs are available. It could also support transportation for participants in retraining&#13;
programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

APPENDIX 2&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
(f)    Contract Execution: ETF Executive Committees would have the authority to approve and&#13;
execute contracts up to US$25,000. Contracts above this threshold would have to be submitted to the&#13;
full ETF Board for approval.&#13;
Criteria for Specific Services&#13;
(a)    Criteria for Counseling. Job Finding, and Relocation Services&#13;
1.     Eligible Services: family and social counseling, job search and finding assistance,&#13;

screening of individuals for participation in follow-up labor adjustment activities (e.g.&#13;
retraining, public works, small business assistance), and provision of information on legal&#13;
rights. Maximum length of contracts is 12 months.&#13;
2.     Eligible Local Agencies: Employment Service municipal offices, non-government non-&#13;
profit agencies (NGOs), private firms, and other labor organizations that demonstrate&#13;
minimum capabilities to provide services (e.g. trained staff, facilities, financial viability,&#13;
placement capability).&#13;
3.     Eligible Costs: staff and administrative personnel costs, rent and utilities, non-durable&#13;
equipment and materials, client transportation for job interviews, depreciation of capital&#13;
equipment limited to 30% per year and to 20% of the total contract; minor facility&#13;
refurbishment, limited to 20% of the total contract, and relocation expenses including travel&#13;
of family and transport of personal belongings to a maximum of US$500 per family.&#13;
(b)    Criteria for Retraining Services 1'&#13;
1.     Eligible Services: vocational skills, literacy, communications (including foreign&#13;
language) and mathematics skills, small business skills training and management training.&#13;
Maximum length of training per individual is 6 months.&#13;
2.     Eligible Agencies and Costs: (a) Private, NGO, and public training institutions would&#13;
be reimbursed for: staff and administrative personnel costs, rent and utilities, non-durable&#13;
equipment and materials, trainee transportation, depreciation of capital equipment purchased&#13;
limited to 50% per year and 20% of an individual contract, minor facility refurbishment&#13;

total unit costs noted above; or (ii) instructor, participant transportation and living costs, and&#13;
non-durable costs, whichever is less. F'&#13;
(c)     Criteria for Education and Retraining Services (individual voucher program, para. 9ci)&#13;
Under this option, individual unemployed soldiers would identify ongoing training programs&#13;
at approved institutions, and enroll in ETF-approved programs at institutions. The institution&#13;
would be reimbursed by the ETF for costs incurred. This individual voucher program is not&#13;
available for Enterprise On-Job-Training.&#13;
1.      Eligible Services: (i) short-term  institutional retraining services (see BI), plus (ii)&#13;
support to individual demobilized soldiers who are returning to University to complete studies&#13;
disrupted by the war to complete post secondary and University education).&#13;
2.      Eligible agencies: Essentially the same as for Group Training (see b 2), with the&#13;
added provisions that: (i) the institutions and programs must be on an approved list at the&#13;
Canton (to be developed by the ETF extension agent in cooperation with the CSC) and (ii) the&#13;
institutions must have a contract executed with the ETF that defines agreed unit costs and&#13;
agreed level of job placement for qualifying programs. Institutions not meeting agreed&#13;
placement rates within the preceeding 12 month period will be deleted from the approved list.&#13;
3.      Eligible costs: The same as for Group Training (see b 2) with the same maximum&#13;
average unit costs (US$500) and maximum costs (US$750). Note: all payments under the&#13;
voucher program would be to the participating institution on a monthly basis, and would be&#13;
based on invoices for services delivered to approved participants.&#13;
6/      Note: All retraining contracts are to include a pre-negotiated rate of job placement in the range of 60-90 percent and&#13;
would include incentives for exceeding agreed placement rates (e.g. 10 percent bonus payments) and disincentives for&#13;
not achieving agreed placement rates (e.g. the withholding of 10% of f-nal payment for training services and loss of&#13;
eligibility for further contracts). Information confirming labor market demand (e.g. review and endorsement by the&#13;
Cantonal Steering Committee) are required before training contracts are tinalized between ETF and service provider.&#13;
Training service providers would be required to provide follow-up job placement information to the ETF, both when&#13;
participants exit training and on a sample of at least 25% of trainees three months after program exit.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The overall objective of the Emergency
            Demobilization and Reintegration Project is to assist
            economic reintegration of displaced workers into the
            civilian workforce in order to reduce the burden on
            families, decrease dependency on eventual social assistance,
            and increase economic productivity. The project will
            finance, in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the
            Republika Srpska, the implementation of: improved labor
            market information data bases, counseling and job-finding
            services, education and retraining services, and management
            support units to assist the Employment and Training
            Foundations which are responsible for implementation
            management in the Federation and the Republika Srpska.
