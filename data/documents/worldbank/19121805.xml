so specified, and only such specified criteria, shall be used to determine whether a&#13;
bidder is qualified. Qualification shall be assessed on a "pass or fail" basis, and merit&#13;

prospective bidder's capability and resources to effectively perform the contract,&#13;

and specific experience, and satisfactory past performance and successful completion&#13;

financed out of the proceeds of the Financing shall provide that bidders, suppliers and&#13;

providers, or suppliers, shall permit the World Bank to inspect all accounts, records,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-16-&#13;
