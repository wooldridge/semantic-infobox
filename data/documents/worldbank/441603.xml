        <abstracts>
            The PPI (Private Participation in
            Infrastructure) Project Database covers private
            participation in infrastructure in developing countries. The
            database records details of all projects owned or managed by
            private companies in 1984-97 in the water, energy,
            transport, and telecommunications sectors. This Note focuses
            on private water and sewerage projects that reached
            financial closure between 1990 and 1997 and surveys regional
            trends, type of private participation, project size, and top
            sponsors and operators. The PPI Database reveals the
            following trends in private participation in water and
            sewerage: a) a regional and national concentration of
            private water projects, reflecting varied government efforts
            to create conditions for sustainable private involvement
            through pricing, regulatory, and institutional reforms, but
            also a ripple effect from growing government familiarity
            with private involvement in the sector; b) a dominance of
            concession contracts compared with divestitures, BOT (build,
            operate, transfer) contracts, leases, and, management
            contracts; and c) a few international companies sponsoring
            and operating most major projects.
