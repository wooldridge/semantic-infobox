Interview with Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
By Robert Oliver                                    July 25, 1961&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:    Now, sir, would you identify yourself?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:   This is Harold Larsen at his second session in front of&#13;
&#13;
this machine.   As I said on that former occasion, I joined the&#13;
&#13;
Bank in January 1948.&#13;
&#13;
       I think it's important to realize how very innocent we all&#13;
&#13;
were in those days about what we were supposed to be doing and&#13;
&#13;
how we were supposed to do it.    For example, I was sent overseas&#13;
&#13;
on my first mission as economist (Iâ&#128;&#153;ve been an economist&#13;
&#13;
continually in the Bank) in March 1948.     In these days one would&#13;
&#13;
not send people overseas so quickly.     There's a thing now called&#13;
&#13;
indoctrination.    I traveled quite extensively in my first two&#13;
&#13;
years.    I participated in the first missions to Peru, Ecuador,&#13;
&#13;
Bolivia, Brazil, to the Argentine, to the Dominican Republic, to&#13;
&#13;
Costa Rica.   I think that's the list of what we might call the&#13;
&#13;
First Bank missions in that area.&#13;
&#13;
       Now, at least I in 1948 was quite unclear as to what it was&#13;
&#13;
the Bank was trying to do and what contribution the economist&#13;
&#13;
could make.   On the other side, on the side of our customers,&#13;
&#13;
they had no idea what the Bank was or what it was prepared to do&#13;
&#13;
or what it was inhibited from doing.     So in those early days it&#13;
&#13;
was largely a question of mutual education.    I was trying to&#13;
&#13;
learn their problems, and they were trying to learn how to handle&#13;
&#13;
us.   We were queer people and speaking a language they didn't&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 1 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
really understand.    They had hoped that we would make loans in&#13;
&#13;
financial terms without inquiring too closely into the purposes&#13;
&#13;
of what we were furnishing the money for.    This concept of&#13;
&#13;
specific projects they found difficult to grasp, and the idea of&#13;
&#13;
not lending for local currency they found difficult to accept.&#13;
&#13;
They thought we should do so.&#13;
&#13;
        We on the other side, as no doubt you've heard from other&#13;
&#13;
people, had difficulty in convincing ourselves that the projects&#13;
&#13;
they suggested were either appropriate or properly prepared.&#13;
&#13;
However, I won't enlarge on that because I was working on&#13;
&#13;
projects as such.&#13;
&#13;
        Now, to return to what the economist was supposed to do.&#13;
&#13;
The prime responsibility of the economist as it developed in the&#13;
&#13;
Bank is the determination of this thing called creditworthiness.&#13;
&#13;
We quickly found that it's by no means easy to feel confident&#13;
&#13;
that you can say a country can or cannot repay a foreign exchange&#13;
&#13;
loan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   This was the definition of creditworthiness in those days,&#13;
&#13;
the ability of the country to repay the foreign exchange costs of&#13;
&#13;
the loan?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:    Our loans always were in foreign exchange.   The country&#13;
&#13;
on their side, by the way, as an aside, found it difficult to&#13;
&#13;
comprehend why we were interested in such things as balance of&#13;
&#13;
payments prospects.    Having grasped the idea that we would lend&#13;
&#13;
for projects, if a project was sound, why didn't we lend?      We&#13;
&#13;
                                - 2 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
were inquiring into all their affairs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:    Was this concern pretty much restricted to Latin-American&#13;
&#13;
countries or would you say that all the borrowing countries had&#13;
&#13;
the same sort of question?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:    I think of all of them the first time they encountered&#13;
&#13;
us.    Remember, though, that I was for 11 years in Latin America&#13;
&#13;
only.    I only heard Bank rumors of what was happening elsewhere.&#13;
&#13;
And in those very early days considerable activity was directed&#13;
&#13;
towards Latin America.&#13;
&#13;
        Well, I think we first envisaged the analysis of&#13;
&#13;
creditworthiness as a type of transfer problem.     Assuming that&#13;
&#13;
your borrowing entity had the necessary pesos or whatever the&#13;
&#13;
local currency was, could they transfer it across the exchanges.&#13;
&#13;
Now, as you know, there is in the history of economic literature-&#13;
&#13;
-there was in the â&#128;&#152;20s a big debate about transfers in connection&#13;
&#13;
with reparation payments, and we consulted those.     But I don't&#13;
&#13;
think I'll go into that a great deal.    It soon became fairly&#13;
&#13;
apparent that the presence or absence of creditworthiness was not&#13;
&#13;
a balance of payments problem as such.    It was a problem of&#13;
&#13;
economic growth and the use of resources, the level of savings,&#13;
&#13;
the direction of investment.    We began to use words like&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;balanced growth.â&#128;?    We tried to define balance.   We never could.&#13;
&#13;
But it was fairly obvious in many of the countries that economic&#13;
&#13;
development was being conceived of in terms of industrialization.&#13;
&#13;
America had Pittsburgh; England had the black country.     Steel&#13;
&#13;
                                - 3 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                         Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
mills were what gave you economic growth.      We found ourselves&#13;
&#13;
quite unable to agree with that.    We spent most of our early time&#13;
&#13;
saying, â&#128;&#156;Unless you develop your agriculture, you will not get&#13;
&#13;
balanced growth, whatever that is.       And if you don't have&#13;
&#13;
balanced growth, you're never going to be creditworthy.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
     For example, a country that is importing a great amount of&#13;
&#13;
raw materials to support an industrial complex and is growing&#13;
&#13;
with such imports, is going to work itself into a very tight&#13;
&#13;
balance of payments position quite quickly.      This actually&#13;
&#13;
happened in Peru in one stage.    They were importing wheat which&#13;
&#13;
they could grow, and they were importing meat, which they should&#13;
&#13;
be able to produce.   [Because they were not developing&#13;
&#13;
agriculture.]&#13;
&#13;
     Well, this is a somewhat rambling discussion, I realize,&#13;
&#13;
because I have not in fact prepared a reasoned paper for your&#13;
&#13;
purposes.   But in our groping around, we were assisted by&#13;
&#13;
something which has changed subsequently in the Bank.      Our&#13;
&#13;
initial economic reports were written for management only and did&#13;
&#13;
not go anywhere else.   That is to say, they did not go to the&#13;
&#13;
executive directors--and not to the countries.      They were&#13;
&#13;
confidential staff documents.    This gave you considerable&#13;
&#13;
latitude in what you said and how you said it.      For example,&#13;
&#13;
particularly in those days in Latin America, prospects for&#13;
&#13;
economic growth may be impaired by political instability.        And in&#13;
&#13;
estimating the possibility that resources might be allocated&#13;
&#13;
wisely, to use the jargon, one had to take into account the&#13;
&#13;
possibility of revolution or political strife.      It's pretty&#13;
&#13;
                                 - 4 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
difficult to write about that in a public document.    Not that our&#13;
&#13;
documents ever are public, but they become public in a sense when&#13;
&#13;
they go to our board of executive directors because they&#13;
&#13;
represent the member countries.   It was quite remarkable that a&#13;
&#13;
change in the report style occurred when it was decided that the&#13;
&#13;
staff reports should be edited and sent to the executive&#13;
&#13;
directors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   And when did this change occur?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:   I think that occurred in 1949.   There was a time when we&#13;
&#13;
were writing two reports.   We would write one for management and&#13;
&#13;
then write a second edition.   This was a horrible thing to have&#13;
&#13;
to do, and finally it was decided we would write only one report&#13;
&#13;
which would be suitable for going to the E.D.â&#128;&#153;s and then write&#13;
&#13;
one of what you might call the â&#128;&#156;inside dirtâ&#128;? of what we had&#13;
&#13;
acquired, which could go to the management verbally or by&#13;
&#13;
circulating around.&#13;
&#13;
      This search for a test of creditworthiness has not ended.&#13;
&#13;
The economic staff is still playing around with ratios,&#13;
&#13;
magnitudes, variables, which may or may not be relevant.    But I&#13;
&#13;
think itâ&#128;&#153;s worth saying (perhaps Iâ&#128;&#153;m cynical) but I don't believe&#13;
&#13;
the economist by himself can answer that question.    I think the&#13;
&#13;
economist can identify and at times measure certain relevant&#13;
&#13;
factors, such as, for example, one I have just mentioned: the&#13;
&#13;
neglect of agriculture leading to the necessity of increasing&#13;
&#13;
food imports.   What is really at issue is:   to repay debt, you&#13;
&#13;
                               - 5 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
have to have domestic savings, and you have to decide to transfer&#13;
&#13;
the savings back to the foreigners who have originally lent you&#13;
&#13;
the money.    In other words, in the future you are going to have&#13;
&#13;
to make a decision to forgo some of your own input in repayment&#13;
&#13;
to repay debt.   The question is whether the people in the&#13;
&#13;
government in the future will decide to forgo output which they&#13;
&#13;
otherwise could have--bygones be bygones, the original loan being&#13;
&#13;
almost forgotten.   This becomes a question of the level of&#13;
&#13;
sacrifice involved.   I think an economist can eliminate that to&#13;
&#13;
some extent.   They can say:   â&#128;&#156;In contingency A, the degree of&#13;
&#13;
sacrifice involved in paying the debt is not very much.     In&#13;
&#13;
contingency B, it would be quite large.    Is contingency B a&#13;
&#13;
probable contingency or a possible one?â&#128;?   And then you also have&#13;
&#13;
to make a noneconomic judgment:    Are these a people and a&#13;
&#13;
society which will make sacrifices to repay debt?   One can&#13;
&#13;
readily think of some countries which would endure considerable&#13;
&#13;
hardship to do so; others who may regard their international&#13;
&#13;
obligations, financial or indeed political (and somewhat more&#13;
&#13;
likely political in terms of international treaties, military&#13;
&#13;
alliances), as not worthy of making sacrifices or minimum&#13;
&#13;
sacrifices.&#13;
&#13;
     Now, when I say that you might have a contingency B, which&#13;
&#13;
would involve sacrifices for debt repaid, I don't think any of us&#13;
&#13;
at any stage contemplated a world-wide depression of the early&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#152;30s as something they would have to endure to make repayments.&#13;
&#13;
In a sense all bets would be off in that contingency.   We do have&#13;
&#13;
the power in our articles to agree to a suspension of debt&#13;
&#13;
                                - 6 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
repayment to be considered if the circumstances which cause the&#13;
&#13;
different difficulty are in the first place acute; in the second&#13;
&#13;
place beyond the countryâ&#128;&#153;s control.&#13;
&#13;
Q:   And perhaps hopefully temporary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:   And we would, of course, regard them as temporary.    If&#13;
&#13;
it wasn't temporary, then we would really have failed--not only&#13;
&#13;
the Bank, but the world.   This is something you can't seriously&#13;
&#13;
contemplate.   After all, we did recover from the depression.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   When you were talking about this problem of the generation of&#13;
&#13;
future savings as such, which would make possible the repayment&#13;
&#13;
of loans, did you consider as a separate issue the transfer of&#13;
&#13;
the problem itself, or did you figure that if the country was&#13;
&#13;
able to get the saving, that the foreign exchange problem would&#13;
&#13;
have been solved more or less automatically?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:   No, we also used to consider the transfer problem&#13;
&#13;
itself.   I think you can erect a theoretical model under which if&#13;
&#13;
you had this savings, the foreign exchange would become available&#13;
&#13;
automatically.   But this acquires a free economy, with freedom of&#13;
&#13;
all prices, including an exchange rate--regarding that as one&#13;
&#13;
price.    This is not a model that is applicable to any of those&#13;
&#13;
countries.   They are controlled economies.   They are not even&#13;
&#13;
freely competitive in the main.   Theyâ&#128;&#153;re riddled with monopoly.&#13;
&#13;
And therefore the generation of local currency savings by no&#13;
&#13;
means guarantees that the foreign exchange will be available.&#13;
&#13;
                                - 7 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I was going to say particularly if the International Monetary&#13;
&#13;
Fund insists upon stable exchange rates in the process.&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:   Quite.   Perhaps I might retreat.   I think one of the&#13;
&#13;
things weâ&#128;&#153;ve found very hard to balance in our own thinking and&#13;
&#13;
in our presentation of our reports was the short run and the long&#13;
&#13;
run.   The fact that a country is enduring balance of payments&#13;
&#13;
difficulties today does not mean by itself that she is not&#13;
&#13;
creditworthy for long-term loans, a 20-year loan.    On the other&#13;
&#13;
hand, if you examine only the long-range prospects of growth and&#13;
&#13;
you pay no attention to the day-to-day administration of policy,&#13;
&#13;
you may have a country with excellent long-range prospects, which&#13;
&#13;
is subject to a continuous series of short-term misjudgments; so&#13;
&#13;
that those long-range prospects are not in fact realized.    I&#13;
&#13;
think that has been pretty much the history of Brazil for the&#13;
&#13;
last 12 to 13 years.    Thereâ&#128;&#153;s nothing wrong with Brazil at all,&#13;
&#13;
with a little self-sacrifice in the short run and wisdom in the&#13;
&#13;
longer run, in making today's decisions with an eye on the future&#13;
&#13;
instead of deciding everything in terms of today's expediency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Trying to lengthen the maturity of its average debt, the&#13;
&#13;
average term of its total debt.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:   Basically what's been the matter with Brazil has been&#13;
&#13;
two things:   its coffee policy, which has been highly&#13;
&#13;
inflationaryâ&#128;&#148;its support price for coffee and its method of&#13;
&#13;
financing that support price and which is almost but not quite&#13;
&#13;
the same thing, the large budget deficits.    Now, if you had a&#13;
&#13;
                                - 8 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
government, including a Congress, which would have insisted on&#13;
&#13;
balanced budgets, and there would have not been this inflation,&#13;
&#13;
you would not have had continuous import control of one sort and&#13;
&#13;
another, with grotesque exchange rate systems, behind which grew&#13;
&#13;
an industrial structure which is the pride and joy of the&#13;
&#13;
Brazilians but is completely inefficient.     This, I think, is an&#13;
&#13;
example where the short term decisions are the important ones.&#13;
&#13;
     As a matter perhaps of interest, Brazil first got into&#13;
&#13;
grotesque balance of payments difficulties in 1951 and at that&#13;
&#13;
time ran into a debt to the outside world, including Europe, of&#13;
&#13;
something in the magnitude of $1.3 billion in the form of unpaid&#13;
&#13;
bills.    It was gross mishandling.   They owed the United States&#13;
&#13;
exporters about $750 million in unpaid bills.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q: How did the International Bank feel, incidentally, about the&#13;
&#13;
activities of the Ex-Im Bank in this period?    Which kept bailing&#13;
&#13;
out individual exporters, for example, by assuming their debts?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:   Well, the Brazilians simply sat back and waited for the&#13;
&#13;
Export-Import Bank to bail them out, waited for the American&#13;
&#13;
exporters to exert enough pressure on Washington that it became&#13;
&#13;
irresistible.&#13;
&#13;
     The Brazilian explanation for this was that they thought&#13;
&#13;
there was going to be a major world conflagration arising from&#13;
&#13;
Korea.    They had such a shortage of imports during World War II,&#13;
&#13;
and they had deliberately over-ordered and stockpiled imports to&#13;
&#13;
stand off a siege economy for a while in the event supplies were&#13;
&#13;
                                - 9 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
cut off.   And this is pretty much accepted by everybody.&#13;
&#13;
Everybody in the outside world said, â&#128;&#156;Well, it is a&#13;
&#13;
miscalculation,â&#128;? and they could understand it.&#13;
&#13;
     Well, a Bank mission, which in point of fact consisted of&#13;
&#13;
me only, went down there and spent two months going around asking&#13;
&#13;
people questions and so on.    And I came back and said, â&#128;&#156;This is&#13;
&#13;
not a case of miscalculation.    This is built into the Brazilian&#13;
&#13;
economy.   They will always have balance of payments difficulties&#13;
&#13;
as long as they continue these domestic policies.    Korea affected&#13;
&#13;
the timing of this crisis, but the crisis was inevitable.       And at&#13;
&#13;
their level of operations, it will not relieve the crisis to&#13;
&#13;
remove it.   It will only postpone the next recurrence.â&#128;?      This was&#13;
&#13;
pretty hard for the Brazilians to take and pretty hard for&#13;
&#13;
Washington to take.    We had long discussions with the key&#13;
&#13;
Washington agencies:   Treasury, Federal Reserve, Ex-Im Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Finally it was accepted that this was a valid diagnosis.      I was&#13;
&#13;
even sent back to convince the Brazilians it was a valid&#13;
&#13;
diagnosis.   Well, in that case the Ex-Im bailed them out until&#13;
&#13;
they changed.   And the subsequent history has been a question of&#13;
&#13;
constant pressure to endeavor to get them to change.     For a&#13;
&#13;
while, you know, the United States retreated behind the&#13;
&#13;
International Monetary Fund.    It was very difficult to prescribe&#13;
&#13;
harsh American medicine bilaterally between the two sovereign&#13;
&#13;
countries.   An international organization can do it.    So later&#13;
&#13;
doses of Ex-Im bail-out were made available on the condition&#13;
&#13;
firstly that Brazil reached its peace with the Fund and adopted&#13;
&#13;
and applied a stabilization program agreeable to the Fund, and&#13;
&#13;
                                - 10 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the Ex-Im loans were disbursed in monthly installments, and&#13;
&#13;
disbursement of the next monthly tranche would be suspended if&#13;
&#13;
they breached any element in this stabilization agreement.     That&#13;
&#13;
didn't work out, though, because the Brazilians breached it, and&#13;
&#13;
so did the Americans.&#13;
&#13;
      That is an illustration of what I was saying about the&#13;
&#13;
difference between what weight one gives the short-term&#13;
&#13;
phenomenon and the long-term prospects in this creditworthiness&#13;
&#13;
business.   If you ignore the short term, you may be making a&#13;
&#13;
mistake; and if you become obsessed with the short term, your&#13;
&#13;
perspective is quite wrong.   I think we became convinced that&#13;
&#13;
when a country was behaving like Brazil or like Chile was for so&#13;
&#13;
long, or like Uruguay since about 1940, all cheerfully ignoring&#13;
&#13;
the parameters of the economically possible and indulging in&#13;
&#13;
heavy inflation.   Uruguay because of political necessity, in&#13;
&#13;
Chile because it was accepted official doctrine that savings had&#13;
&#13;
to be increased and inflation constituted forced savings and was&#13;
&#13;
inevitable and desirable, one should suspend activities.   The&#13;
&#13;
economists reported to the Bank in all three cases that nothing&#13;
&#13;
was going to change, that the inflation and balance of payments&#13;
&#13;
instability and all that would continue, until conditions had&#13;
&#13;
deteriorated to a point where the public would no longer tolerate&#13;
&#13;
it.   This is precisely what happened in Uruguay.   Despite the&#13;
&#13;
fact that for its own political purposes, the governing party&#13;
&#13;
ignored economic reality completely--granted wage increases&#13;
&#13;
financed from central bank credit and the like--they were heavily&#13;
&#13;
defeated in the election about two years ago; and a party which&#13;
&#13;
                              - 11 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
had been out of power for 90-some years came in.      The public,&#13;
&#13;
which is supposed to be the beneficiary of these policies,&#13;
&#13;
repudiated them.   The same has happened in Chile.     So when you&#13;
&#13;
get into this sort of situation, you can always sit the storm out&#13;
&#13;
until things reach bedrock, and then there will be a political&#13;
&#13;
determination made to change.    It's no good haranguing them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I suppose Turkey would be another illustration of this point.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:   Yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   When you were concerned with the excessive imports that the&#13;
&#13;
Brazilians were having, was it a matter of concern also as to&#13;
&#13;
whether these were imports which were leading to capital growth&#13;
&#13;
of the country or whether they were simply used to finance&#13;
&#13;
current consumption?    Or was this an issue even?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:   It wasn't a true issue, because although the proportion&#13;
&#13;
of capital equipment in total imports did rise, it was the wrong&#13;
&#13;
capital equipment being used for the wrong purposes.      It was not&#13;
&#13;
sustaining a sound basis for economic growth.     Sure, you can&#13;
&#13;
import machine tools.   If you completely prohibit the import of&#13;
&#13;
the product of those machine tools, what have you got?&#13;
&#13;
      There is, however, one interesting thing.      In that time I&#13;
&#13;
was in Brazil everybody was saying that all Brazilian industry--&#13;
&#13;
and I underline the word â&#128;&#156;allâ&#128;?--was highly inefficient.      Well, I&#13;
&#13;
went around SÃ£o Paulo, and I went to the branches of foreign&#13;
&#13;
                                - 12 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
firms, the subsidiaries of foreign firms which had foreign&#13;
&#13;
management and foreign techniques and foreign know-how and&#13;
&#13;
foreign patents that they were using.     For example, the American&#13;
&#13;
Tire Company or Phillips Electric Lights.    Now, one ought to be&#13;
&#13;
able to make prima facie assumption that these firms were&#13;
&#13;
efficient on the managerial side and the technical side, because&#13;
&#13;
they were not Brazilian.   They were working in Brazil, but they&#13;
&#13;
were not Brazilian.   Iâ&#128;&#153;d ask them what the ex-factory price of&#13;
&#13;
this particular product was, and then Iâ&#128;&#153;d ask them what was the&#13;
&#13;
ex-factory price of that same product in their home factory, and&#13;
&#13;
they'd look up in their catalogs and tell me.     And so I got a&#13;
&#13;
number of equivalents--Brazilian price and home price--for a&#13;
&#13;
whole range of products.   And then I worked the exchange rate&#13;
&#13;
which would make those prices equivalent in each separate case.&#13;
&#13;
And it clustered at that time at an exchange rate of about 75&#13;
&#13;
when the de facto [official] rate was about 30.    So quite clearly&#13;
&#13;
the Brazilian cruzero was badly overvalued.    And if you started&#13;
&#13;
reworking it at an exchange rate of 55, some parts of Brazilian&#13;
&#13;
industry began to look not so bad.     Other parts still looked&#13;
&#13;
dreadful.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Did anybody argue that the Brazilians were getting better&#13;
&#13;
terms of trade on account of their overvalued currency and that&#13;
&#13;
this was a good thing?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:   No, because at that time the Brazilians were not&#13;
&#13;
exporting any manufactures at all.&#13;
&#13;
                              - 13 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   And the price of coffee I suppose was determined almost aside&#13;
&#13;
from the exchange rate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:   Well, in our textbooks we would say it is, but you get a&#13;
&#13;
curious crossfeed of expectations--that in fact exchange rate&#13;
&#13;
does affect the price of coffee.   The economist would say it was&#13;
&#13;
perverse, but in fact the world price of coffee is usually&#13;
&#13;
regarded as the York price.    But, they do watch the exchange&#13;
&#13;
rate, and they do react to the exchange rate, although the&#13;
&#13;
physical supply and the physical demand is unchanged.    You can&#13;
&#13;
say that these two curves intersect in New York, but they&#13;
&#13;
sometimes behave as though they are intersecting in Brazil.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Who else in the Bank dealt with Brazil in these years?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:   At this time. . .   When was this reorganization in the&#13;
&#13;
Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   In â&#128;&#153;52.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:   Yes, at the time I did this it was after the&#13;
&#13;
reorganization, and I became economic adviser to the western&#13;
&#13;
hemisphere.    I was in Brazil at that time.   A chap called Ray&#13;
&#13;
Carlson came in in â&#128;&#153;53.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Mr. Knapp I think had also been there for the State&#13;
&#13;
Department, had he not?&#13;
&#13;
                               - 14 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:   Mr. Knapp was named by the U.S.   He was on leave from&#13;
&#13;
the Bank to go down to be the American chairman of the joint&#13;
&#13;
Brazilian-U.S. commission.    It was a joint thing manned on one&#13;
&#13;
side by the U.S. and the other side by the Brazilians.    And they&#13;
&#13;
were supposed to be drawing up a development program, investment&#13;
&#13;
priorities and all that.     I think the only thing that happened of&#13;
&#13;
really lasting value was a process of education to one or two&#13;
&#13;
Brazilians who subsequently became influential.    I think you&#13;
&#13;
could say that directly out of the work of that commission the&#13;
&#13;
only tangible thing that occurred was the establishment of the&#13;
&#13;
Brazilian Bank for Economic Development.    Its original staff was&#13;
&#13;
largely drawn from the Brazilian staff of the commission where&#13;
&#13;
they had time to think and a lot of argument with their American&#13;
&#13;
opposite members, and they got some education.    And one of the&#13;
&#13;
important people there was Roberto Campos, who, as you may have&#13;
&#13;
noticed, has just been appointed Brazilian ambassador to&#13;
&#13;
Washington.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I wonder if you would comment about the overall relations of&#13;
&#13;
the Bank to the Latin-American countries.    One of your colleagues&#13;
&#13;
in the Bank suggested to me that it was, or perhaps ought to be,&#13;
&#13;
a matter of concern that in the documents preparing the way for&#13;
&#13;
the new Montevideo conference, there is no mention at any point&#13;
&#13;
of the activities of the Bank, suggesting that the Latinos are&#13;
&#13;
not happy even today with the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:   When one is talking about Latin America it's always&#13;
&#13;
                                - 15 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
dangerous to generalize, because every country is very different&#13;
&#13;
from every other country.    There's no such thing as a Latin-&#13;
&#13;
American mentality or a Latin-American economy.     But having said&#13;
&#13;
that, there is a Latin-American solidarity.   They're inclined to&#13;
&#13;
go along with one another, even if they don't agree.     There is a&#13;
&#13;
Latin-American bloc.   Now, that Latin-American bloc is extremely&#13;
&#13;
dissatisfied with the Bank and always has been.     It stems from&#13;
&#13;
the fact that we don't make loans available in financial terms.&#13;
&#13;
We insist on specific projects.    They think we are much too tough&#13;
&#13;
in our project standards.   They think we should lend for local&#13;
&#13;
currency expenditures.   They think we should loan for social&#13;
&#13;
overhead--hospitals, schools, water supply.    In other words, we&#13;
&#13;
are very much a Wall Street enterprise--hard-eyed and&#13;
&#13;
unsympathetic.&#13;
&#13;
     They initially got pretty mad at us because we talked about&#13;
&#13;
defaulted debt.   They regarded this as passed, as the sins of&#13;
&#13;
their fathers.    It wasn't entirely their fault.   The world did&#13;
&#13;
throw a depression at them, and why should they have to be&#13;
&#13;
bothering about that now?&#13;
&#13;
     As an anecdote on that, there was a conference of the&#13;
&#13;
Economic Commission for Latin-America in Santiago, and I was sent&#13;
&#13;
there as the Bank's observer, and the president of Chile&#13;
&#13;
delivered a stinging attack on the Bank.    He said that Chile went&#13;
&#13;
to the Bank with her desperate needs for development, and did he&#13;
&#13;
receive a sympathetic reception?   No, he did not.    Did anybody&#13;
&#13;
try to understand their aspirations?    No, they did not.   What&#13;
&#13;
happened?   The Bank started talking to them immediately about&#13;
&#13;
                               - 16 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
$170 million or so worth of debt which had been in default since&#13;
&#13;
the depression.   Is this helping Chile?   But, because there was&#13;
&#13;
nobody else to whom they could turn, they settled the debt.&#13;
&#13;
     They got a loan for I think $14 million.     Is this a quid&#13;
&#13;
pro quo for sacrifices?   At the end of it some of his economic&#13;
&#13;
advisers saw me in the corridor, and said, â&#128;&#156;That was a fine&#13;
&#13;
speech the old man made, wasn't it?     Youâ&#128;&#153;ve got no answer to a&#13;
&#13;
thing like that.â&#128;?   I said, â&#128;&#156;I think it was an excellent speech,&#13;
&#13;
and I'm sure all the other countries present were extremely&#13;
&#13;
interested to sure that Chile had no intention of paying their&#13;
&#13;
debts.â&#128;?   They didnâ&#128;&#153;t like that at all.    I mean they thought that&#13;
&#13;
they should not settle old obligations which they had undertaken.&#13;
&#13;
This is a curious Latin-American mentality, by the way, and one&#13;
&#13;
of the things that makes it rather difficult to deal with them.&#13;
&#13;
A public official, a minister of finance or what have you, will&#13;
&#13;
sign a document in his official capacity with no feeling of&#13;
&#13;
personal responsibility whatever.   At the same time if you lend&#13;
&#13;
him money personally, he would sell his hacienda to pay you back,&#13;
&#13;
because his status as a gentleman caballero would be involved.&#13;
&#13;
But there's no morality involved in his official acts whatever.&#13;
&#13;
     Now, to retrace slightly.   I was describing the attitude of&#13;
&#13;
what I call the American bloc.   We have, however, I think one or&#13;
&#13;
two staunch friends in Latin America who do not subscribe to this&#13;
&#13;
but who sit silent when this is expounded because they do not&#13;
&#13;
want to get into conflict with their neighbors.     Those are Peru,&#13;
&#13;
Mexico, Costa Rica and to some extent Colombia.     I think Ecuador&#13;
&#13;
is not very unhappy with us.   They were at some stages.   Colombia&#13;
&#13;
                               - 17 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
at times was unhappy with us, but it was temporary.   But Peru has&#13;
&#13;
long supported us.&#13;
&#13;
      One of the things which they accused us of also, which I&#13;
&#13;
didn't mention, was that we didn't lend for private industry to&#13;
&#13;
any remarkable extent, and we didn't lend for smaller or medium&#13;
&#13;
private industry, and that when we did lend, we required a&#13;
&#13;
government guarantee.   Now, that to them is quite unacceptable&#13;
&#13;
and for understandable reasons.   None of them could get a&#13;
&#13;
government guarantee without cutting the government in some way.&#13;
&#13;
So we devised the International Finance Corporation and were&#13;
&#13;
successful in getting the support of the major members of the&#13;
&#13;
Bank for that institution-- namely, the United States, the&#13;
&#13;
European countries.   And this was announced at one of the Inter-&#13;
&#13;
American Economic Conferences.    It fell like a lead balloon.&#13;
&#13;
There was no enthusiasm or interest shown by the Latin-Americans,&#13;
&#13;
and they were very, very slow in coming in and joining.      And yet&#13;
&#13;
this is what they'd been asking for.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Have you any explanation for why they reacted as they did?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:   They were disappointed in the scale of the thing, and&#13;
&#13;
they thought the Articles of Agreement were too restrictive.&#13;
&#13;
Once more the Articles of Agreement were too restrictive, just as&#13;
&#13;
the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s were, because instead of being their thing, it turned&#13;
&#13;
out again to be the creditor countriesâ&#128;&#153; instrument.   Of course&#13;
&#13;
now they have their Inter-American Bank, and this has diverted&#13;
&#13;
their attention from us for a while.   Which, by the way, we&#13;
&#13;
                              - 18 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
helped them establish.   We helped them with the language of the&#13;
&#13;
articles, but it's their bank.    Some of our staff went to the&#13;
&#13;
Inter-American Bank.   We haven't endeavored to instruct the&#13;
&#13;
Inter-Americans.   They can have their own bank, sure.&#13;
&#13;
      One of the Latin-American member countries, when Mr. Black&#13;
&#13;
was visiting it--he had an interview with the President, and they&#13;
&#13;
were very unhappy with us.    The president said, â&#128;&#156;Unless, Mr.&#13;
&#13;
Black, you do so-and-so for my country, I will withdraw from&#13;
&#13;
membership in the Bank.â&#128;?    This was the ultimate threat, you see.&#13;
&#13;
We would have to yield on that.    Mr. Black looked at him and&#13;
&#13;
said, â&#128;&#156;Certainly, Mr. President, withdraw if you wish.â&#128;?    And the&#13;
&#13;
President said, â&#128;&#156;If I do withdraw, Mr. Black, I will explain to&#13;
&#13;
the world why I am withdrawing.â&#128;?    And Mr. Black said, â&#128;&#156;That is&#13;
&#13;
your right.    The other thing you will do is repay all your loans&#13;
&#13;
immediately.â&#128;?    They did not withdraw.   We have since lent them&#13;
&#13;
money.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   So the policy of polite firmness on the part of the Bank you&#13;
&#13;
think is perhaps showing some fruits?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:   Well, one may be deluding oneself in things like this,&#13;
&#13;
but certainly when I left the western hemisphere I did have the&#13;
&#13;
feeling that the Bank was being better understood and better&#13;
&#13;
appreciated.    One had had the experience of meeting a senior&#13;
&#13;
government official who said, â&#128;&#156;Remember that fight we had five&#13;
&#13;
years ago?    You were quite right, you know, and I'm very glad you&#13;
&#13;
stuck to your guns.    We would have been wrong.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
                               - 19 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      You're getting a new generation coming forward in Latin&#13;
&#13;
America.   They understand their business better, and therefore&#13;
&#13;
understand our attitude better.    A leading example of that is the&#13;
&#13;
gentleman I mentioned a little while ago:    Roberto Campos.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I wonder if we might talk a bit about the policy in the Bank&#13;
&#13;
itself in these early daysâ&#128;&#148;â&#128;&#153;47, â&#128;&#153;48, â&#128;&#153;49, when there was a&#13;
&#13;
research staff and also a loan department--and these questions of&#13;
&#13;
what constitutes creditworthiness were being discussed.    There&#13;
&#13;
surely must been conflicts in the Bank itself on some of these&#13;
&#13;
issues.    Could you say something about this question?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:    Well, there were quite severe conflicts within the Bank&#13;
&#13;
itself stemming from multiple causes and focusing on their&#13;
&#13;
relationships between the loan department and the research&#13;
&#13;
department.    The loan department took the view that they were the&#13;
&#13;
Bank and that every other department was a service department to&#13;
&#13;
it; just as the legal department or treasury is a service&#13;
&#13;
department, so is the research department.    And basically the&#13;
&#13;
economists were a damn nuisance.    Theyâ&#128;&#153;re pretty long-haired;&#13;
&#13;
they come, many of them, from universities; they weren't&#13;
&#13;
realistic.    And in the very early days for some reason I never&#13;
&#13;
understood the loan department had its own economists.    So to the&#13;
&#13;
extent that the loan department resorted to economists at all,&#13;
&#13;
they naturally turned to their own economic people.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Were the economists in the loan department concerned with&#13;
&#13;
                               - 20 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
questions of creditworthiness or just with the financial&#13;
&#13;
feasibility. . .?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:    Financial feasibility rather than what we now call&#13;
&#13;
creditworthiness.    I think the loan department's opening attitude&#13;
&#13;
was that we were fundamentally an international banker.     We at&#13;
&#13;
least felt that they were not taking a development attitude but&#13;
&#13;
were trying to invest money.    It was also true, of course, at&#13;
&#13;
that time that the major energies of the Bank at the management&#13;
&#13;
level were preoccupied not so much with lending or the criterion&#13;
&#13;
of lending, but with the seasoning of their bonds, overlooking&#13;
&#13;
the borrower.    I think with hindsight they were probably quite&#13;
&#13;
right, because until we had the ability to borrow, we couldn't&#13;
&#13;
lend.    It is true we had our initial capital subscriptions, but&#13;
&#13;
it was in the usual proportionsâ&#128;&#148;the two percents and the eighteen&#13;
&#13;
percents--but these were not very large funds compared to what&#13;
&#13;
one would hope.     And no doubt the legal department will explain&#13;
&#13;
to you what happened in the early days about making our bonds a&#13;
&#13;
legal investment and their status and so on.    This absorbed the&#13;
&#13;
major attention of management.&#13;
&#13;
        Then there were other elements in the situation:   friction&#13;
&#13;
and conflict between the loan department and research.     One was&#13;
&#13;
the economists themselves.    They were not able to communicate&#13;
&#13;
very well.    The sheer problem of communicating an idea existed.&#13;
&#13;
We were in those days using far too much economic jargon.     Having&#13;
&#13;
learned a language of intellectual communication, we try to use&#13;
&#13;
it; and we couldn't use it.    We had to paraphrase it.    And we&#13;
&#13;
                                - 21 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
didn't realize quickly enough how important it was that we do so.&#13;
&#13;
We had, for example, as assistant director of the department Paul&#13;
&#13;
Rosenstein-Rodan, who I think any economist knows.     Management&#13;
&#13;
never understood one word Paul ever said.     They thought he was an&#13;
&#13;
idiot, just because they couldn't understand him.     So there I&#13;
&#13;
think the economist was to blame.      The lawyer they could always&#13;
&#13;
understand.    They could never understand the economist.   It was&#13;
&#13;
also true that the lawyer was much more self-confident than we&#13;
&#13;
were.    He felt able to say things that we weren't ready to say.&#13;
&#13;
We put forward a hypothesis instead of an assertion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Did this lack of communication result in the Bank adopting a&#13;
&#13;
narrow policy with respect to its loans than might otherwise have&#13;
&#13;
been the case?    Or did it have in fact any effect on the lending&#13;
&#13;
operations of the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:    Taking the broad sweep of the last 13 or so years, I&#13;
&#13;
don't think so.    Possibly we might have done some of the things a&#13;
&#13;
little sooner than we've done them, but I don't think there's&#13;
&#13;
been any permanent damage.&#13;
&#13;
        The final factor in this friction between loan and research&#13;
&#13;
was largely a matter of personalities, as it is in any&#13;
&#13;
organization.    This always exists.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   The Italian loan of â&#128;&#153;51 or thereabouts is frequently cited as&#13;
&#13;
one which was made substantially at the insistence of the&#13;
&#13;
economists.&#13;
&#13;
                                - 22 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:   Yes, that was one.   Paul Rosenstein-Rodan worked very&#13;
&#13;
hard on that one, together with the Italian Mezzogiorno--the&#13;
&#13;
development body for the Italian South.    And that in effect was a&#13;
&#13;
local currency loan, of course, and they came out with an&#13;
&#13;
extremely sophisticated rationale for the thing, with a great&#13;
&#13;
deal of almost econometrics in the exposition.     And the rest of&#13;
&#13;
the Bank felt most uneasy all the time.    They felt this couldn't&#13;
&#13;
possibly be true.    It was too complicated.   But, that one was&#13;
&#13;
very much an economistâ&#128;&#153;s job, and we've never done that sort of&#13;
&#13;
thing again.     We had so much trouble making people understand why&#13;
&#13;
we were doing it.    We tried to think up different&#13;
&#13;
rationalizations for what was in effect a local currency loan.&#13;
&#13;
Now we have much simpler ideas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   What about the analysis of the economic feasibility of loans&#13;
&#13;
as distinct from the financial feasibility of loans?     Were the&#13;
&#13;
economists concerned about showing the larger ramifications of&#13;
&#13;
given loans, questions of external economies, relations of&#13;
&#13;
projects to programs and things of this sort?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:   Yes.   There were simple strands in that rope, of course.&#13;
&#13;
The word that is so frequently used around the Bank, and which is&#13;
&#13;
not very meaningful from an economic point of view, is the word&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;priority.â&#128;?    What one really means there is:   if the loan is for&#13;
&#13;
a sensible purpose, if the project is sensible in terms of the&#13;
&#13;
economic growth of the country, and you try to do everything in&#13;
&#13;
terms of priority, you break down, as we found out during the&#13;
&#13;
                                - 23 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
war, in the World War administration.      Now, the area economist is&#13;
&#13;
supposed to make a contribution in identifying the sectors in&#13;
&#13;
which investment should be increased or improved or perhaps&#13;
&#13;
specific areas within that sector.      You might say transport is&#13;
&#13;
here something that is lagging; it should be improved, and&#13;
&#13;
specifically it should be raised.    On the other hand, we do not&#13;
&#13;
wish to build new railway lines.    On the other hand, we ought to&#13;
&#13;
improve the efficiency of existing railway lines--this line which&#13;
&#13;
is running from nowhere to nowhere.      That sort of thing the area&#13;
&#13;
economist is supposed to do.&#13;
&#13;
     In doing that, the area economist might draw attention to&#13;
&#13;
possible external economies--the fact that this particular&#13;
&#13;
project might be something of the catalyst, which, if executed,&#13;
&#13;
would lead to other people coming in and being now able to do for&#13;
&#13;
the first time something else.   This is obviously a very&#13;
&#13;
important thing like electric power.      While it is true that your&#13;
&#13;
larger industries use captive power plants, it's not necessarily&#13;
&#13;
desirable from a national point of view that they do so.      He&#13;
&#13;
typically, for example, will put in petroleum, whereas we could&#13;
&#13;
build hydro and avoid getting into petroleum imports.&#13;
&#13;
     What that refers to is the identification of sectors or&#13;
&#13;
possibly ideas for projects within the sectors which would be&#13;
&#13;
desirable.&#13;
&#13;
     When it comes to working on a project or examining the&#13;
&#13;
feasibility of the specific proposal, it changes, broadly&#13;
&#13;
speaking, from the area economist now to the T.O.D. economist--&#13;
&#13;
the technical operations or agricultural man, a transport man or&#13;
&#13;
                               - 24 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                     Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
what-have-you.&#13;
&#13;
      It is also true that your area economist is a member of the&#13;
&#13;
working party and is free to make any comments he wishes about&#13;
&#13;
any of this.   But this is not what is frequently called his prime&#13;
&#13;
responsibility.   He makes a contribution, but it's not his prime&#13;
&#13;
responsibility.   Nobody except the area economist can write a&#13;
&#13;
country economic report.   That's his prime responsibility.&#13;
&#13;
Anybody else can criticize that report.   Only a T.O.D. can write&#13;
&#13;
a technical report together with its economic sections.    Anybody&#13;
&#13;
can criticize that report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   In planning projects (this is really a question of T.O.D.&#13;
&#13;
operations, I suppose), what attention is paid to the actual&#13;
&#13;
engineering techniques of doing things?   Is it, for example, a&#13;
&#13;
policy of the Bank to seek labor intensive ways of doing things&#13;
&#13;
in countries which are very short of capital, even if this would&#13;
&#13;
involve doing things which by American standards would be&#13;
&#13;
regarded as very inefficient?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:   It would be too much to say it's a policy of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
The Bank staff, and especially the economists of the Bank staff,&#13;
&#13;
are alert--or should be alert, to identify a situation where that&#13;
&#13;
may be true.   But it has been, I think, our experience that it's&#13;
&#13;
quite surprising how seldom a thing which seems clear in&#13;
&#13;
textbooks is quite obscure in reality.&#13;
&#13;
      For example, in Pakistan where we had very large roadworks&#13;
&#13;
being constructed under the Indus Basin Settlement Plan and you&#13;
&#13;
                                - 25 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
had a very densely populated country with a considerable amount&#13;
&#13;
of unemployment, the economist would assume prima facie that it&#13;
&#13;
should be as labor-intensive as possible.   I took this up with&#13;
&#13;
the executing authority, the West Pakistan Water and Power&#13;
&#13;
Development Authority, and they had made another arrangement.&#13;
&#13;
They had gone heavily into this question, and it transpired that&#13;
&#13;
the cost to them (the enterprise cost, not necessarily the social&#13;
&#13;
cost) of doing it by labor-intensive methods was higher than&#13;
&#13;
doing it by mechanized methods.   But even more surprising to me&#13;
&#13;
was that they couldn't do it by labor-intensive methods because&#13;
&#13;
there weren't enough donkeys in the country.   The scary thing was&#13;
&#13;
not human labor.   It was donkeys--the sort of thing that you&#13;
&#13;
don't think of.    The donkey has only two panniers, and they&#13;
&#13;
couldn't muster enough donkeys to do this work without destroying&#13;
&#13;
agriculture.   So it's very seldom as clear-cut as that.&#13;
&#13;
      Then, of course, it's almost universally true that if you&#13;
&#13;
do it by mechanized methods, you'll get your benefits quicker.&#13;
&#13;
So when you're working out your cost benefits, the fact that&#13;
&#13;
you're getting benefits quicker may warrant the higher capital&#13;
&#13;
investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   So that in computing capital output ratios, for example, you&#13;
&#13;
have to take into account the time period involved as well asâ&#128;¦?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:   You have to discount future benefits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Having discounted that, do you usually try to find projects&#13;
&#13;
                               - 26 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
which have low capital output ratios?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:   We don't consciously search for them, no.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   I wonder if for the remaining part of the tape it might be&#13;
&#13;
well to turn to quite a different type of question--namely,&#13;
&#13;
something about the relations of New Zealand with the&#13;
&#13;
International Bank, since you were from New Zealand?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:   Yes.   Well, at the time of Bretton Woods a Labor&#13;
&#13;
government was in power, and the Minister of Finance Walter Nash&#13;
&#13;
led the New Zealand delegation, which I believe was quite a good&#13;
&#13;
and intelligent delegation.    And as a delegation, they were fully&#13;
&#13;
prepared to support the Bretton Woods twins; participate, as you&#13;
&#13;
pointed out before we began the tape, in drafting the Articles,&#13;
&#13;
and indeed initial the Articles.    And then they went back to find&#13;
&#13;
a political situation in New Zealand which undermined them.    It&#13;
&#13;
was rather like the League of Nations and President Wilson.       They&#13;
&#13;
found that politically they might endanger their government if&#13;
&#13;
they endeavored to force through these Articles.&#13;
&#13;
      Why?    New Zealand is, or was then, predominantly an&#13;
&#13;
agricultural country.    Since then there's been a considerable&#13;
&#13;
amount of urban development.    And we have a system of assignment&#13;
&#13;
of electorates which makes the rural vote more important than the&#13;
&#13;
urban vote.    The rural vote was one-third or one-half more in&#13;
&#13;
weight.   In these populous rural districts--dairy farms, with a&#13;
&#13;
man running 50, 60, 70 cows for butter and cheese--these men have&#13;
&#13;
                                - 27 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
a mentality which is almost exactly that of the European&#13;
&#13;
peasants.    They are mentally peasants.   They have a very bitter&#13;
&#13;
recollection of the depression of the â&#128;&#152;30s.    It really got into&#13;
&#13;
their souls.    And they have no doubt whatever either then or now&#13;
&#13;
that the depression was entirely engineered by international&#13;
&#13;
finance for its own benefits, and nothing you can say to them&#13;
&#13;
will change their convictions.    So that if they were to join the&#13;
&#13;
Bank, they would have to join the Fund.    If they joined the Fund,&#13;
&#13;
they would be surrendering their monetary sovereignty to the&#13;
&#13;
hands of the international monetary institution, which is a&#13;
&#13;
highly dangerous thing to do, particularly since this&#13;
&#13;
international institution is, in the view of a man on the dairy&#13;
&#13;
farm, dominated by Wall Street.&#13;
&#13;
        Now, the leaders of neither party believed this, nor did&#13;
&#13;
the top civil servants, like the treasury boys and the top&#13;
&#13;
central-bank boys.    Unfortunately, the leader of the opposition&#13;
&#13;
in the National party, capitalized on this by coming out and&#13;
&#13;
making a declaration that he did not think New Zealand ought to&#13;
&#13;
join.    So that when he became Prime Minister, here was this thing&#13;
&#13;
back in his lap.    And it just didn't seem worthwhile to go to the&#13;
&#13;
political trouble and risk of making an issue of this and trying&#13;
&#13;
to get it through with the necessary education.     As it was&#13;
&#13;
explained to me by the Secretary of the Treasury (which is a&#13;
&#13;
senior civil servant in New Zealand, not the Cabinet member), New&#13;
&#13;
Zealand at that time was saving and investing for her own&#13;
&#13;
resources about 22% of national income.     There was one school of&#13;
&#13;
thought in New Zealand, intelligent school of thought, which&#13;
&#13;
                                - 28 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
said, â&#128;&#156;We should increase this rate of investment for the sake of&#13;
&#13;
our children and the future.â&#128;?    And there were others who said,&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Thatâ&#128;&#153;s a pretty damn good performance and we don't need to do&#13;
&#13;
anymore.    Therefore, we don't need to borrow from the Bank or&#13;
&#13;
borrow from anybody.    We can run our own affairs.   Therefore,&#13;
&#13;
there is no need to incur the danger or the risk of going into&#13;
&#13;
these international banking institutions and/or the turmoil at&#13;
&#13;
home.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
        They wanted to establish a paper mill, and they couldn't&#13;
&#13;
scratch together enough money, and they said, â&#128;&#156;Well, the only&#13;
&#13;
place we can get this money is the World Bank, so we might as&#13;
&#13;
well brace for the combat and go into it.â&#128;?    And then the Ex-Im&#13;
&#13;
Bank lent them the money, and so that dropped.&#13;
&#13;
        Recently they've had a series of balance of payments crises&#13;
&#13;
where they've been borrowing in New York and London at 4 1/2 and&#13;
&#13;
4 3/4%, and the fact that this short-term finance for these&#13;
&#13;
purposes is so damned expensive, has finally convinced them that&#13;
&#13;
perhaps they can safely join the Fund.    They've also, of course,&#13;
&#13;
watched the Fund and have decided that it's not such an&#13;
&#13;
authoritarian bankersâ&#128;&#153; institution and that it will be well worth&#13;
&#13;
while to increase New Zealand's international liquidity by&#13;
&#13;
joining the Fund.&#13;
&#13;
        What are their intentions as regards the Bank, I have no&#13;
&#13;
idea.    I doubt that they would come in for anything unless it was&#13;
&#13;
quite big in terms of their own scale of affairs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   But in any event the reluctance of the New Zealander to join&#13;
&#13;
                                - 29 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the Fund does not indicate that they have felt that there's any&#13;
&#13;
criticism to be made in the operations of the Bank, for example,&#13;
&#13;
or the Fund either, for that matter.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:   I don't think so.   Welling now has got to decide to sell&#13;
&#13;
this to the country, and they've taken several steps on that.&#13;
&#13;
About two to three years ago they had a royal commission on money&#13;
&#13;
and credit, and they devoted a great deal of attention to the&#13;
&#13;
Bretton Woods twins and recommended strongly that New Zealand&#13;
&#13;
should join.   So they have that to support their government&#13;
&#13;
attitude.   The Minister of Finance has just produced a nice&#13;
&#13;
little book of, I suppose, 200 pages setting forth the advantages&#13;
&#13;
and disadvantages of both institutions and asserting that he&#13;
&#13;
believes it's highly desirable New Zealand join and giving a list&#13;
&#13;
of operations of both institutions: how a loan is made, a standby&#13;
&#13;
goes to the Fund, the Articles of Agreement--laying the&#13;
&#13;
foundations in public opinion.   They must think that they can get&#13;
&#13;
away with it, because they have applied, and the board of&#13;
&#13;
governors has accepted them.   I think they feel shamefaced,&#13;
&#13;
though, about the curious group of countries they're coming in&#13;
&#13;
with--you know, the particular batch--whereas they could have&#13;
&#13;
been in the foundation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   In just the little bit of tape remaining, I wonder if you'd&#13;
&#13;
care to answer a question I try to ask of everybody, which is if&#13;
&#13;
you can draw contrasts and similarities, if possible, between the&#13;
&#13;
eras of Mr. McCloy and Mr. Black in the Bank.   Have there been&#13;
&#13;
                               - 30 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                         Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
any significant differences, or has everything in the Bank been&#13;
&#13;
pretty much the same under both people?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:    I would say it's been pretty much the same.    After all,&#13;
&#13;
it's been a continuation of pretty much the same tradition.      At&#13;
&#13;
the time that Mr. McCloy was president and Mr. Black was American&#13;
&#13;
executive director, Mr. Black and Mr. McCloy were working&#13;
&#13;
extremely closely together at that time.    Chester McLane was&#13;
&#13;
general counsel, and Dave Sommers was his assistant.      They were&#13;
&#13;
highly influential then in the broad structure of how we did&#13;
&#13;
things.    When McCloy went and McLane went, Black came in and Dave&#13;
&#13;
went up.    They were on the same team.   There is no big breach&#13;
&#13;
with the past.    What has happened since then, as I think would&#13;
&#13;
have happened under either of them, is that we've grown in size&#13;
&#13;
and have had to grow somewhat more mature.    We're a much larger&#13;
&#13;
institution than we were when Mr. McCloy was here, but this is&#13;
&#13;
not because Mr. Black was more energetic or anything.      This would&#13;
&#13;
have happened anyway.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Has it seemed to you that the management of the Bank pays&#13;
&#13;
more attention to economic arguments today, for example, than it&#13;
&#13;
did in the years when you first were with the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:    Yes.   Yes, I think they're much more prepared now to&#13;
&#13;
concede that there may be economic arguments of importance.      What&#13;
&#13;
they are not prepared to concede--and theyâ&#128;&#153;re quite right in&#13;
&#13;
doing so--is that the governing consideration is economic&#13;
&#13;
                                - 31 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
considerations.   We do have some economists who believe that it&#13;
&#13;
should be an economistâ&#128;&#153;s bank.    I don't believe that.   I think&#13;
&#13;
the economist has a contribution to make, an important&#13;
&#13;
contribution, but it's not the dominant consideration.    We may do&#13;
&#13;
something which is not the best in economics as long as you don't&#13;
&#13;
do something that's damn silly.&#13;
&#13;
      The difference, I think, between Mr. McCloy's regime and&#13;
&#13;
Mr. Black's regime is that McCloy had Mr. Garner as Vice-&#13;
&#13;
President, and it was a similar institution.   It was a more&#13;
&#13;
intimate institution.   People knew one another better.   They had&#13;
&#13;
more ready access upwards.   The transfer of Mr. Garner [i.e. to&#13;
&#13;
IFC] when Mr. Black came in, and the establishment of three vice-&#13;
&#13;
presidents, and the growing size of the institution, made for a&#13;
&#13;
much less intimate place than it used to be.   I'll be introduced&#13;
&#13;
to somebody I've never met before and say, â&#128;&#156;Have you just joined&#13;
&#13;
the Bank?â&#128;? and heâ&#128;&#153;ll say â&#128;&#156;No, Iâ&#128;&#153;ve been here several years.â&#128;?     And&#13;
&#13;
I have no idea what he's doing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Do you think that the economists as you were speaking a&#13;
&#13;
moment ago, had their way, the Bank would have made more loans&#13;
&#13;
and probably some bad loans?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Larsen:   Iâ&#128;&#153;m sure we would have made more loans, and we might&#13;
&#13;
have made some bad ones, yes.    I think the early policy of&#13;
&#13;
restraint probably paid off.    Don't forget we've had a capital&#13;
&#13;
increase.   If we'd fallen flat on our face in the early days&#13;
&#13;
through eagerness or carelessness, we'd never have gotten that&#13;
&#13;
                                - 32 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                     Harold Larsen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
capital increase, without which we would not have continued to&#13;
&#13;
grow.   I think the early, careful, slow laying of the foundation,&#13;
&#13;
which annoyed many of our member countries, right from the start,&#13;
&#13;
probably paid off.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q:   Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

            On July 25, 1961, Harold Larsen was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Robert Oliver. Duringhis tenure at the
            Bank from 1948 to 1974, Mr. Larsen worked in the research
            department (1948) and as economic advisor in department of
            operations for the western hemisphere. He participated in
            the first missions to Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Brazil,
            Argentina, Dominican Republic, and Costa Rica. His
            transcript concerns the dissatisfaction with the World Bank
            of countries in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region.
