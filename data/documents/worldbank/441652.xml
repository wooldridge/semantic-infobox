Note No. 115   Water Privatization and Regulation&#13;
in England and Wales&#13;
Caroline        In 1989, England and Wales embarked on one of the first modern privatizations in the water sec-&#13;
van den Berg    tor. The government sold ten publicly owned water companies-encompassing water and sewer-&#13;
age assets and operating licenses-and set up a new, independent sector regulator. These&#13;
reforms have delivered an impressive volume of new investment, full compliance with the&#13;
world's most stringent drinking water standards, a higher quality of river water, and a more&#13;
transparent water pricing system. But experience during the first regulatory cycle also reveals&#13;
some lessons about the information requirements of effective regulation and the risks to the&#13;
political independence of the regulator. This Note reviews these lessons.&#13;
Before 1989, the water industry in England and   as an independent government agency, were&#13;
Wales consisted of ten publicly owned water   supposed to limit political discretion in policy&#13;
authorities and twenty-nine privately owned   and investment decisions. To further strengthen&#13;
water supply companies. The government ar-  independence, the regulator was given broad&#13;
gued for privatizing the publicly owned ser-  discretion in interpreting the law, implement-&#13;

for past underinvestment.                 of economic regulation is the use of price caps.&#13;
These caps set maximum prices for all water&#13;
The government split the water authorities,  companies, in five-year cycles. A second inno-&#13;

        <abstracts>
            In 1989, the United Kingdom embarked on
            one of the first modern privatizations in the water sector,
            selling assets under license and setting up an independent
            economic regulator. An important regulatory innovation is
            its use of price caps and yardstick competition. The author
            highlights two lessons from U.K. regulatory experience:
            effective price cap regulation has heavy information
            requirements, and the necessary data and analytical tools
            take time to assemble. And such built-in checks and balances
            as financial autonomy for the regulator and status as an
            independent government department are not always enough to
            prevent political interference.
