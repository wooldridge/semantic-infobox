include some of which are just about better operational management and some which require investment. There are three&#13;
levels of priority: immediate; this year; and after this year.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This report covers water safety planning
            for Sikkim, India&#146;s rural drinking water system. It consists
            of two volumes. Volume I is a Training Manual. It begins
            with an introduction to water quality and public health.
            Section 2 covers the status of rural drinking water in
            Sikkim. Section 3 describes how to prepare a village water
            safety plan. It ends with several tables and figures. Volume
            II consists of six planning templates for the water safety
            plan: Technical and Financial Survey for Spring Source
            Gravity Flow Schemes; Water Source Plan; Water Safety Plan;
            Operating Plan; Service Improvement Plan; and Performance Indicators.
