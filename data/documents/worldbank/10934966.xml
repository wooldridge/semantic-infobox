&#13;
A regional workshop on Microfinance for East Asia and the Pacific was held in Manila, Philippines,&#13;
from March 20 to 24, 2000. The workshop was organized by the Governance, Regulation and&#13;
Finance Division (WBIGF) of the World Bank Institute, in collaboration with the Foundation for&#13;
Advanced Studies on International Development (FASID) of Japan. The four and a half day&#13;
workshop aimed at bringing together microfinance practitioners from the East Asia and the Pacific&#13;
region, including policy makers, central and commercial bankers, and NGOs, to discuss the&#13;
sustainability and best practices of microfinance operations. The agenda of the workshop focused on&#13;
four key areas of discussion: evolution of microfinance practices and changes in the markets;&#13;
different approaches, methodologies, and delivery systems; policy and regulatory environment for&#13;
microfinance institutions (MFIs); and institutional capacity building. A full-day field trip to local MFIs in&#13;
the Philippines was also organized during the workshop.&#13;
&#13;
There were four specific objectives for the workshop: 1) providing participants with the information&#13;
and tools necessary to develop microfinance operations in their countries based on best practice&#13;
standards; 2) helping participants to identify specific activities to improve the policy and regulatory&#13;
framework and support institutional capacity building of MFIs; 3) providing an opportunity for&#13;
networking among microfinance practitioners; and 4) facilitating dialogue between policy makers and&#13;
MFIs. The workshop was attended by a total of 116 participants from 16 countries. They included 5&#13;
Bank staff and 19 resource persons who served primarily as presenters or speakers. Resource&#13;
persons represented academic/research institutions, as well as selected MFIs/NGOs operating in&#13;
South East Asian countries.&#13;
&#13;
The WBI Evaluation Unit (WBIES) conducted an on-site Level 1 (participants' reaction) evaluation&#13;
using a participants' feedback questionnaire. The evaluation targeted specifically participants from&#13;
the East Asia and the Pacific region, who were the primary audience of the workshop (N=92). The&#13;
feedback questionnaire consisted of three sections. The first section asked the extent to which the&#13;
respondents were satisfied with workshop content and delivery. The second section asked the level&#13;
of respondents' knowledge about specific topics before and after the workshop, based on self-&#13;
assessment. A 5-point Likert type scale that ranged from 1 = "minimum" to 5 = "maximum" was used&#13;
for the majority of the questions in this section. In addition, a 5-point scale of 1 = "insufficient" to 5 =&#13;
"excessive," with a score of 3 being "adequate," was used to rate such questions as the level of&#13;
interaction among participants and the number of participants. The third section was respondents'&#13;
open-ended comments about the workshop. The questionnaire was completed and returned by 71&#13;
out of the 92 targeted participants (a response rate of 77.2%). Twenty-three respondents (32.4%)&#13;
were women.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Respondent Background&#13;
&#13;
     ·   The 71 respondents who returned the questionnaire represented the following organizations:&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     19 (26.8%) from MFIs/NGOs; 13 (18.3%) from donor countries or agencies; 11 (15.5%) from&#13;
     local or state level governments; 10 (14.1%) from Central Banks or state-owned Banks; 5&#13;
     (7.0%) from academic or research institutions; 2 (2.8%) from commercial banks; and 10&#13;
     (14.1%) from other institutions. One respondent did not answer this question (1.4%).&#13;
  ·  Participants to the workshop were found fairly new to the subject of microfinance. About 72%&#13;
     of all respondents reported having had five or fewer years of professional experience&#13;
     working in a relevant area. This was particularly prominent among the donor and government&#13;
     participants, who responded having dealt with issues on microfinance for either less than one&#13;
     year (58%) or one to five years (42%). Respondents from MFIs/NGOs, on the other hand,&#13;
     reported having had more experience with the subject. About 42% of this group had below&#13;
     five years of experience, 37% had six to ten years, and 21% had over 11 years of work&#13;
     experience involving microfinance operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Workshop Content, and Delivery&#13;
&#13;
  ·  Results of closed-ended responses indicated that participants' level of satisfaction with the&#13;
     workshop was above the midpoint of the 5-point scale, or 3.0, on all measures of design and&#13;
     organization. For example, the mean scores of six key performance indicators were the&#13;
     following: relevance of the workshop to participants' current work or functions (3.93); the&#13;
     extent to which information provided was new to participants (3.57); usefulness of the&#13;
     information acquired (4.03); the degree to which the content focused on participants' learning&#13;
     needs (3.48); the achievement of the announced objectives (3.81); and the overall&#13;
     usefulness of the workshop (3.93). The percentage of respondents who gave a higher rating&#13;
     of either "4" or "5" on the overall usefulness of the workshop, an indicator of quality&#13;
     performance used by WBI, was 70% for the workshop. This was well below the "85%"&#13;
     benchmark expected for all WBI training activities. However, the result varied among&#13;
     respondents. Donor respondents were more likely to have viewed the workshop as useful&#13;
     (92% giving a rating of "4" or "5"), compared to government respondents (73%) or those from&#13;
     MFIs/NGOs (63%).&#13;
  ·  The workshop had 4 specific objectives. The objective that achieved the highest rating&#13;
     among respondents was the extent to which participants developed a useful network with&#13;
     other microfinance practitioners during the workshop (mean=4.04). The perceived benefit of&#13;
     this aspect of the workshop was particularly positive among representatives from&#13;
     academic/research institutions (4.5), donors (4.2), and MFIs/NGOs (4.1). On other&#13;
     objectives, however, the ratings were clearly lower. For example, the applicability of different&#13;
     methodologies presented to respondents' countries were was among the lowest in score&#13;
     (3.29), particularly among government participants (3.0) and MFI/NGO participants (3.2). The&#13;
     extent to which the workshop helped participants to identify their next specific activity plans&#13;
     (3.69) was perceived more favorably among donors (4.0) and commercial bank participants&#13;
     (5.0) than among MFI/NGO participants (3.4). On the opportunity for dialogue between policy&#13;
     makers and MFIs (3.54), 80% of the respondents from academic/research institutions felt the&#13;
     workshop was highly successful, giving a rating of "4" or "5" (3.6). The percentage on this&#13;
     item was much lower among government participants (40%, 3.3) and MFI/NGO participants&#13;
     (47%, 3.5).&#13;
  ·  On key discussion areas from four plenary sessions of the workshop, respondents were&#13;
     asked to rate their levels of understanding as they perceived them before attending the&#13;
     workshop and after having completed all of the sessions. Respondents' pre-workshop ratings&#13;
     ranged from 2.48 (Institutional capacity building: supporting the development of microfinance&#13;
     and sector tier structures) to 2.64 (Different approaches, methodologies, and delivery&#13;
     systems) on a 5-point scale. Their post-workshop ratings indicated a positive gain of 49% to&#13;
     54% across thematic sessions. The mean scores at the end of all plenary sessions ranged&#13;
     from 3.72 (Institutional capacity building: supporting the development of microfinance and&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
       sector tier structures) to 3.96 (Evolution of microfinance and changes in the MF markets).&#13;
       The results should be interpreted with caution, however, since they measured respondent&#13;
       impression of their achievement, based on self-assessment. They did not reflect&#13;
       respondents' actual learning gains.&#13;
   ·   On the structure of the workshop, three issues were highlighted. On the number of workshop&#13;
       participants, for example, about half of the respondents (48%) felt the size of the workshop&#13;
       was "excessive" or "somewhat excessive," while the other half (49%) reported the number of&#13;
       participants as "adequate." Similarly, nearly half of the respondents (44%) felt the time&#13;
       allocated for question and answer sessions was "insufficient" or "somewhat insufficient"&#13;
       (49% rated "adequate" on this item). Interaction among participants was perceived sufficient&#13;
       by 53% of the respondents, whereas 30% rated this item as "insufficient" or "somewhat&#13;
       insufficient".&#13;
   ·   Overall, the workshop received positive feedback from respondents. Over 95% of the&#13;
       respondents (64 out of the 67 respondents) reported that they valued the experience of the&#13;
       workshop and would recommend this type of activity to their colleagues in the future. Three&#13;
       respondents who reported they would not recommend this workshop to others were&#13;
       participants from central or state-owned banks (2) and a donor representative. They did not&#13;
       provide any specific reasons to justify their responses, except that one respondent reported&#13;
       the lack of relevant microfinance programs in his country.&#13;
   ·   A number of respondents provided specific comments and suggestions as to how the&#13;
       workshop can improve in the future as a training activity. There were two major points. First,&#13;
       the workshop should take more interactive approaches in delivering its messages (N=19).&#13;
       This would include allocating more time for discussions and debate, more small group&#13;
       activities, and providing more opportunities for participants to exchange success/failure&#13;
       stories from their experiences on microfinance operations. Another issue raised was the&#13;
       need for improvement in the focus of workshop contents (N=18). Respondents preferred that&#13;
       the workshop either deal with fewer topics in greater depth, or target specific type(s) of&#13;
       microfinance practitioners at a time. One suggestion provided in this area was that, when&#13;
       inviting participants from a wide variety of institutions and backgrounds, the workshop should&#13;
       provide separate sessions that focus on specific issues and give participants a choice of&#13;
       selecting the relevant sessions to attend according to their personal needs.&#13;
   ·   A large majority of respondents (62 out of the 66 respondents, or 94%) expressed a positive&#13;
       intention of applying the knowledge and experience obtained from the workshop to their day-&#13;
       to-day work. Three key areas of utilization mentioned by respondents were the following: 1)&#13;
       using knowledge obtained from the workshop in facilitating their own research on&#13;
       microfinance and improving their work plans and activities (34, or 55%); 2) taking specific&#13;
       actions on existing microfinance programs in their work place, such as making&#13;
       recommendations to authorities to review programs, formulating or redesigning financial&#13;
       products to better meet the needs of clients, and improving or updating training modules on&#13;
       microfinance for clients (19, or 30.6%); and 3) disseminating information and materials&#13;
       obtained from the workshop to colleagues, authorities, and microfinance practitioners (9, or&#13;
       14.5%).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Implications&#13;
&#13;
   ·   The workshop was successful, primarily in gathering various types and levels of microfinance&#13;
       practitioners in one forum to discuss issues relevant to the region. The provision of an&#13;
       opportunity to expand and improve networking among the practitioners was the most&#13;
       valued aspect of this workshop. If a similar workshop is to be planned in the future,&#13;
       however, there are few points to be considered. One is that the workshop would need to&#13;
       provide or ensure a more participatory learning environment for all participants.&#13;
       During the workshop, it was often observed that participants from the same countries,&#13;
       particularly those from South East Asian region, were more outspoken and asked questions&#13;
       to speakers, compared to those from the East Asian and the Pacific region. The question&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  and answer session was provided at the end of each plenary session, but only a few&#13;
  participants asked questions. Second, an effort should be made to ensure meeting the&#13;
  learning needs of all groups of participants. In the Manila workshop, the ratings on&#13;
  workshop performance given by certain groups of respondents, particularly those from&#13;
  MFIs/NGOs, tended to be less favorable, compared those given by donor and government&#13;
  respondents. One solution may be that separate workshops be organized for different types&#13;
  of players of microfinance (e.g. government policy makers, financial institutions or credit&#13;
  lenders, and representatives of NGOs), as well as for practitioners at different levels of&#13;
  development (e.g. those from newly established MFIs with less experience on microfinance&#13;
  operation, and those from already established, experienced MFIs, etc.).&#13;
· In order to assess the effect of this regional workshop, a tracer study has been proposed.&#13;
  Participants to the Manila workshop will be contacted in six months for the study and will be&#13;
  asked if there have been any changes in the microfinance institutions in their countries or in&#13;
  their work environment. Results of the assessment will be released upon completion of the&#13;
  study.&#13;

            Regional workshop on microfinance for East
            Asia and the Pacific
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            A regional workshop on microfinance for
            East Asia and the Pacific was held in Manila, Philippines,
            from March 20 to 24, 2000. The four and a half day workshop
            aimed at bringing together microfinance practitioners from
            the East Asia and the Pacific region, including policy
            makers, central and commercial bankers, and non-government
            organizations (NGOs), to discuss the sustainability and best
            practices of microfinance operations. The agenda of the
            workshop focused on four key areas of discussion: evolution
            of microfinance practices and changes in the markets;
            different approaches, methodologies, and delivery systems;
            policy and regulatory environment for microfinance
            institutions (MFIs); and institutional capacity building. A
            full-day field trip to local MFIs in the Philippines was
            also organized during the workshop. There were four specific
            objectives for the workshop: 1) providing participants with
            the information and tools necessary to develop microfinance
            operations in their countries based on best practice
            standards; 2) helping participants to identify specific
            activities to improve the policy and regulatory framework
            and support institutional capacity building of MFIs; 3)
            providing an opportunity for networking among microfinance
            practitioners; and 4) facilitating dialogue between policy
            makers and MFIs. The workshop was attended by a total of 116
            participants from 16 countries. They included 5 Bank staff
            and 19 resource persons who served primarily as presenters
            or speakers. Resource persons represented academic/research
            institutions, as well as selected MFIs/NGOs operating in
            South East Asian countries.
