FOREWORD&#13;
This paper is one in a special series of World Bank Staff&#13;
Working Papers on population change and development.     Prepared as&#13;
background papers for the World Development Report 1984, they&#13;
provide more detailed treatment and documentation of the issues&#13;
dealt with in Part II of the Report.    The papers cover a range of&#13;
topics, including the effects of population growth and change on&#13;
economic development, the determinants of fertility and mortality,&#13;
the links between population growth and internal and international&#13;
migration, and the management, financing, and effectiveness of&#13;
family  planning  programs.    They  include   several  country and&#13;
regional studies of fertility change and population policy.&#13;
The background papers draw on a large number of published&#13;
and unpublished studies of individual researchers, on Bank policy&#13;
analysis and research, and on reports of other organizations&#13;
working on population and development programs and issues.       The&#13;
papers   are   the  work   of   individuals   and   the  views   and&#13;
interpretations expressed in them do not necessarily coincide with&#13;
the views and interpretations of the Report itself.&#13;
I hope these detailed studies will supplement the World&#13;
Development Report 1984 in furthering understanding of population&#13;
and  development   issues  among   students  and   practitioners  of&#13;
development.&#13;

Abstract&#13;
This paper traces the sources of assistance for family planning&#13;
and other "population" programs from developed countries and the flow of&#13;
assistance through principal "channel" organizations to developing&#13;
countries. Official development assistance for population comes primarily&#13;
from the United States, the Nordic countries, and more recently from the&#13;
Federal Republic of Germany and Japan. Population assistance is channeled&#13;
mainly through the United Nations Fund for Population Assistance (UNFPA),&#13;
non-governmental organizations, bilateral programs, and the World Bank.&#13;
The paper discusses why developing countries seek and why&#13;
developed countries offer population assistance, focusing on official views&#13;
of how population growth and high fertility affect economic development,&#13;
environment, maternal and child health, and women's welfare. It explains&#13;
why some countries are reluctant to seek or provide more population&#13;
assistance. It analyzes what population assistance does to extend reliable&#13;
and affordable family planning services and information and to improve&#13;
understanding of population growth, its causes, and consequences. It&#13;
summarizes current population policies and family planning programs in&#13;
major regions of the third world and discusses the role of assistance.&#13;
The paper brings out comparative advantages of principal&#13;
organizations providing population assistance, focusing on UNFPA, the major&#13;
non-government organizations, and the major bilateral programs. Finally,&#13;
the paper discusses the evolution of "policy issues" affecting population&#13;
assistance, especially donors' concern for "demand" for family planning,&#13;
cost-efffectiveness of family planning services, safety, and voluntarism.&#13;
It notes efforts to assess the future need for population assistance.&#13;
Acknowledgment&#13;
My thanks to several organizations for sharing thoughts and&#13;
previously unpublished information so readily. UNFPA, the International&#13;
Planned Parenthood Federation, Family Planning International Assistance,&#13;
the Pathfinder Fund, the Population Council, U.S. Agency for International&#13;
Development, and Swedish International Development Authority were&#13;
particularly helpful. Thanks also to my colleagues in the Bank, especially&#13;
in PHN but also Nancy Birdsall, Paul Isenman and Alex Shakow, for help with&#13;
earlier drafts. Responsibility for remaining shortcomings is, of course,&#13;
mine.&#13;

Ce document analyse les sources de l'assistance en faveur du&#13;
planning familial et d'autres programmes de "population" fournie par les&#13;
pays d6veloppes et suit le cheminement de I'assistance, par les&#13;
principales organisations "canalisatrices", jusqu'a son arrivee dans les&#13;
pays en d6veloppement. La plus grande partie de laide publique au&#13;
developpement destin6e aux programmes de population vient des Etats-Unis.9&#13;
des pays scandinaves et9 plus r6cemment, de la Republique f6derale&#13;
d'Allemagne et du Japon. L'aide aux programmes de population est&#13;
achemin6e essentiellement par l'intermediaire du Fonds des Nations Unies&#13;
pour les activit6s en matiere de population (FnUAP), des organisations non&#13;
gouvernementales, des programmes bilat6raux et de la Banque mondiale.&#13;
Le document analyse pourquoi les pays en d6veloppement&#13;
demandent, et pourquoi les pays developpes offrent, une assistance en&#13;
matiere de population, et expose les points de vue officiels concernant&#13;
les effets de l'accroissement de la population et d'une fecondi;te elev6e&#13;
sur le developpement &amp;conomique, 1'environnement, la sante maternelle et&#13;
infantile et la condition f6minine. On explique pourquoi certains pays&#13;
r6pugnent a rechercher ou a fournIr davantage d'aide en matiere de&#13;
population. On analyse comment cette aide elargit les possibilit6s&#13;
d'acces a des services de planning familial sars et peu coateux et comment&#13;
elle permet de diss6miner des informations sur ces services. On examine&#13;
egalement la fac,on dont elle permet de sensibiliser l'opinion a- la&#13;
question de l'accroissement de la population, ses causes et ses&#13;
cons6quences. Le document fait le point sur la politique demographique et&#13;
les programmes de planning familial en vigueur dans les grandes r6gions du&#13;
tiers monde et etudie le role de lassistance.&#13;
I1 presente 6galement les avantages compar6s des principales&#13;
organisations qui fournissent une aide dans le domaine de la population,&#13;
faisant une large place au FNUAP, aux grandes organisatior.s non&#13;
gouvernementales et aux principaux orogrammes bilat6raux. Enfin, l'auteur&#13;
examine l1evolution des "principes de 'Lassistance aux programmes de&#13;
population, en particulier linteret apport6 par les donateurs a la&#13;
"demande" de planning familial, au rapport cout-efficacite des services de&#13;
planning familial9, a la minimisatÂ°on des risques et au caractere&#13;
volontaire du planning familial. Il prend note des efforts d6ployes pour&#13;
evaluer les besoins futurs d'assistance dans le domaine de la population.&#13;

Extracto&#13;
En este informe se examinan las fuentes de asistencia para lns&#13;
programas de planificaci6n familiar y otros programas relativos a la&#13;
poblaci6n en paises desarrollados y las corrientes de asistencia a trav6s&#13;
de organizaciones principales que la encauzan hacia los paises en desarro-&#13;
llo. La asistencia oficial para el desarrollo en materia de poblaci6n&#13;
proviene principalmente de los Estados Unidos de Am6rica, los paises nor-&#13;
dicos y, en los ultimos anios, de la Republica Federal de Alemania y del&#13;
Jap6n. La asistencia para fines de poblaci6n se canaliza en su mayoria a&#13;
trav6s del Fondo de las Naciones Unidas para Actividades en Materia de&#13;
Poblaci6n (FNUAP), organizaciones no gubernamentales, programas bilatera-&#13;
les y el Banco Mundial.&#13;
Se analizan las razones por las cuales los paises en desarrollo&#13;
buscan este tipo de asistencia y los paises desarrollados la ofrecen,&#13;
haciendo hincapie en opiniones oficiales acerca de la forma en que el cre-&#13;
cimiento de la poblaci6n y una fecundidad elevada afectan el desarrollo&#13;
econ6mico, el ambiente, la salud materno-infantil y el bienestar de la&#13;
mujer. Se explica por qu6 algunos paises estAn poco dispuestos a buscar o&#13;
a proporcionar mas asistencia para fines de poblaci6n. Se examina lo que&#13;
hace esta asistencia para ampliar los servicios seguros y econ6micamente&#13;
alcanzables de planificaci6n familiar y la informaci6n al respecto y para&#13;
mejorar la comprensi6n del crecimiento de la poblaci6n, sus causas y con-&#13;
secuencias. Se resumen las actuales politicas demogrAficas y los progra-&#13;
mas de planificaci6n familiar en regiones importantes del Tercer Mundo y&#13;
se examina la funci6n de la asistencia.&#13;
En el documento se destacan las ventajas comparativas de las&#13;
organizaciones principales que prestan asistencia para fines de poblaci6n,&#13;
en especial FNUAP, las principales organizaciones no gubernamentales y los&#13;
programas bilaterales mAs importantes.   Por ultimo, se examina la evolu-&#13;
ci6n de las "cuestiones de politica" que afectan la asistencia para estos&#13;
fines, en especial la preocupaci6n por la "demanda" de planificaci6n fami-&#13;
liar, la eficacia en funci6n de los costos de estos servicios, la seguri-&#13;
dad y el caracter voluntario de la aceptaci6n. Se observan tambien los&#13;
esfuerzos por evaluar la futura necesidad de asistencia para fines de&#13;
poblacion.&#13;

Summary and Conclusions&#13;
1.        Where does "population assistance" for developing countries come&#13;
from? Where does it go, and through what organizations? Why is it given&#13;
and why sought? What does it accomplish?&#13;
2.        This paper traces the flow of population assistance from&#13;
donor governments through major "channel" organizations to developing&#13;
countries.l/ "Population assistance" for family planning and other&#13;
"population programs" accounts for less than two percent of all official&#13;
development assistance provided by governments--about $370 million annually&#13;
now (over 90% grants). It comes primarily from the United States, the&#13;
Nordic countries, Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany. Beyond this&#13;
the World Bank lends for population and related health services.Z/ This&#13;
paper focuses on official population assistance from governments and covers&#13;
Bank lending only as it affects this assistance.&#13;
3.         Official population assistance goes through three main channels:&#13;
(1) the United Nations Fund for Population Activities and other U.N.&#13;
agencies, (2) non-governmental organizations, notably the worldwide network&#13;
of national family planning associations loosely tied together through the&#13;
International Planned Parenthood Federation, and (3) bilateral programs,&#13;
primarily that of the United States. The World Bank is the major&#13;
additional channel. Population assistance goes to widely distributed&#13;
countries in all three major continents of the third world. While most&#13;
donors and channels try to give priority to poorer countries and regions,&#13;
opportunities there may be limited, and allocations thus reflect&#13;
opportunities as well as "need."&#13;
4.         Donors and recipients of aid are driven to contribute and request&#13;
population assistance from four principal rationales, differentially&#13;
weighed and accepted by different sources of political support. Most&#13;
readily accepted is a maternal and child health rationale, based on what&#13;
family planning can do for the health and well-being of children and their&#13;
mothers. Related to this is a women's opportunity rationale. Increasingly&#13;
widely accepted and espoused is a development rationale, based on the&#13;
burden population growth imposes on efforts to raise living standards.&#13;
Most controversial is a growth-limits rationale, based on the asserted&#13;
danger that continued population growth will overwhelm the environment of&#13;
individual countries or of the earth itself.&#13;
5.         Indeed, po central are these rationales, that some explanation is&#13;
required to account for the minute share of development assistance that has&#13;
gone to population programs. The explanation lies partly in incomplete&#13;
1/ Assistance as defined by the United Nations. Separating assistance&#13;
"for population" from that "for health" is difficult.&#13;
2/ Total Official Development Assistance as defined by the Development&#13;
Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and&#13;
Development (OECD) also includes governments' contributions of capital&#13;
to the World Bank. But "official population assistance" is defined as&#13;
ODA provided by governments specifically to address population and&#13;
excludes Bank lending for population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2 -&#13;
acceptance of the rationales. Primarily, however, it lies in ceesp     eelings&#13;
and powerful political forces aroused in some countries by "blrth control"&#13;
methods and "population-control" programs that raise a spectre of&#13;
government intrusion in the most private decisions of life0 These&#13;
reactions can cause ambivalence and conflict among those who Influence&#13;
governments and their assistance programs. Moreover, competing claims for&#13;
assistance arise from agriculture, educatIlon, etc., particularly when&#13;
assistance budgets are highly constrained.&#13;
6. 0The same ambivalence and conflict often affect progress in family&#13;
planning activities and population policies in individual count-ies0 That&#13;
progress also depends on economic and social development in a country, on&#13;
its cultural and political heritage and educational status, and cn the&#13;
extent to which population size and growth are obvious sources of&#13;
difficulty.&#13;
7.         On the whole, however, family planning in the third uorld has&#13;
grown more popular over the past decade. Over 90% of the peop.l in the&#13;
third world live in countries where governments are trying to extend family&#13;
planning for health reasons. Moreover, the governments of about two-thlrds&#13;
of these people seek to slow population growyth as a matter of official&#13;
policy and support family planning for that reason too0     The coamercial&#13;
sector is also active, particularly in Latin America, sometimes w^ith&#13;
government assistance. In many developing countries a fourth to a half of&#13;
fertile-age couples practice family planning, and the trend is generally&#13;
rising.&#13;
80        But the current stage of population programs differs ri.arkedly&#13;
from country to country and even from region to region0&#13;
9.         In East Asia several governments long committed to slowIAng&#13;
population growth have brought family planning to individual coemunlties&#13;
and households0 "Outreach" workers, often backed by health clin:cs,&#13;
provide family planning and child health care0    In Indonesia anc. T5haland,&#13;
over three-fourths of the people are now wAthin convenient reac&amp; of family&#13;
planning and over half of all fertile-age couples practice fami.:y planningo&#13;
1o0       In South Asia government commitment has been strong but demand&#13;
for family planning more limited by poverty, conservative culture, and&#13;
illiteracy0 Services there are relatively weaker-and harder to organize&#13;
because of limited management capecity, weak infrastructure, and. vast and&#13;
difficult terraino Ambitious efforts are nonetheless underway to extend&#13;
family planning and broader primary health care0    In India about^ one-fourth&#13;
of fertile-age couples practice family planning, in Bangladesh nerhaps&#13;
one-sixtho&#13;
110        In Latin America rapid development has generated consieerable&#13;
demand for family planningo   Faced with official reluctance to oxtend&#13;
family planning, private organizations initiated services and nÂ¢o provide&#13;
some outreach, particularly in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico0     Drugg stores&#13;
and private health care providers also help0 Some governments, -otably&#13;
Colombia and Mexico, have shifted policy and now support family ?1anning0&#13;
120       In Africa, where high birth rates reflect strong pronz:t-alist&#13;
traditions and programs are difficult to carry out, governments a-e&#13;
beginning to express concern about population issues0 Most have begun to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3-&#13;
extend primary health care, often including family planning at least in&#13;
principle for health reasons, but family planning services remain mostly&#13;
limited to urban clinics and scattered outreach "pilots."&#13;
13.        In the Near East, cultural traditions affecting women and&#13;
economic conditions still often yield pronatalist attitudes, but several&#13;
countries (e.g., Egypt and Tunisia) are committed to family planning and&#13;
are trying to extend services.&#13;
14.       Population programs have involved unusually close cooperation&#13;
between assistance organizations and developing-country governments, family&#13;
planning organizations, and other local groups to:&#13;
--   bring reliable, affordable and acceptable family planning&#13;
services and information within closer reach of people even in&#13;
rural areas;&#13;
--   increase research to improve family planning methods and ways of&#13;
delivering services;&#13;
--   improve understanding of demographic trends and their causes and&#13;
consequences.&#13;
Developing countries as a whole now contribute more to their own population&#13;
and family planning programs than they receive in assistance. Assistance&#13;
organizations nonetheless remain critical sources of funding, technical&#13;
advice and logistical support. Continuity of such assistance (policy,&#13;
funding levels, mechanisms) is key to smooth operation of programs.&#13;
UNFPA&#13;
15.       UNFPA is the principal channel for population assistance to&#13;
governments particularly for the poorer countries of Asia and Africa.&#13;
UNFPA typically assists in establishing population policies and family&#13;
planning services and information programs (often along with maternal and&#13;
child health services).   It supports research and demographics too.     Its&#13;
annual program of roughly $130 million (all grants) exceeds one-third of&#13;
official population assistance. It is supported by over 90 countries.&#13;
The United States provides about one-fourth of UNFPA's income.&#13;
IPPF&#13;
16.       The national family planning associations of IPPF typically&#13;
initiate family planning service delivery, to show that services will&#13;
indeed be used. They press governments to extend family planning and to&#13;
adopt supportive policies. As governments do extend family planning, the&#13;
associations shift focus toward hard-to-reach groups or new kinds of&#13;
services. (Sometimes--e.g. Colombia and recently in Africa--governments&#13;
ask the associations to help extend family planning.) The associations&#13;
provide critical continuity even during political upheaval and often set&#13;
standards for cost-effectiveness. They now spend about $90 million&#13;
annually, over half from official development assistance from some 25&#13;
nations. UNFPA and other organizations add modest amounts.&#13;
Other Private Channels&#13;
17.       Family Planning International Assistance--part of the U.S.&#13;
national family planning association--helps introduce family planning in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-. 4-. &#13;
innovative ways, often through private organizatlons0 Ito annual program,&#13;
recently over $15 million, is funded largely by the United States0&#13;
180       The Pathfinder Fund, at around $7 million annually also largely&#13;
from the United States, looks for small "pathf'.nding" ways to introduce&#13;
family planning and build public suppcrt for population policies0&#13;
19o       The Association for Voluntary Sterilization, at around $10&#13;
million annually also largely from the United States, extends safe,&#13;
voluntary sterilization for men and women as a family planning option0&#13;
20.       The Population Council, at about $15 million annuaily, analyzes&#13;
what influences fertility and population growth, funds research on family&#13;
planning methods and services, and offers technical assistanceo    All these&#13;
organizations provide grants.&#13;
21o       Other non-government organizations based in developqd or&#13;
developing countries support family planning to a modest degree as part of&#13;
broader health, educational, or other efforts (e.g., mission hospitals in&#13;
Africa).&#13;
Bilateral Aid&#13;
22.       Bilateral aid comes primarily from the United States and also&#13;
from the Nordic countries, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and several&#13;
other countries, Countries sometimes prefer to give aid bilzterally to&#13;
help countries that matter especially to them and to exercise mDre direct&#13;
control over funds (emphasizing research, support for EGOs, outreach, etc.)&#13;
World Bank&#13;
23.       The World Bank is increasing its population and related health&#13;
lending to governments particularly in Asia and Africa Itz has organized&#13;
several multi-donor programs to help fund major basic health and population&#13;
programs0  It discusses population in policy dialogues and fua6s research0&#13;
Results&#13;
240       Population assistance has funded much of the family planning and&#13;
related analysis undertaken in the third world over the past fifteen&#13;
years0  Thus its impact cannot be isolated from w^hat the developing&#13;
countries have themselves done to extend family planning0 Birth rates have&#13;
started down0 But why?&#13;
25o       In deciding to practice family planning, couples must weigh the&#13;
costs and benefits of another child against the cost and benefits of&#13;
available family planning services as they see them0   Their views on&#13;
desired family size reflect their social and economic circumst,anceso&#13;
Particularly where women's opportunities are constrained and childrenle&#13;
prospects for education and eventual jobs are bleak, many couDles want&#13;
large families0  Nonetheless many undesi:ed pregnancies occur, particularly&#13;
where modern family planning services are scarce0&#13;
26o       Eviden_e suggests substantial increases in family planning&#13;
practice occur within a year or teyo after good services are e2etended,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
followed by lower fertility. Where development has generated economic and&#13;
social conditions conducive to smaller families and to effective program&#13;
management, family planning services are often welcomed and fertility falls&#13;
rapidly (e.g., Mexico and Colombia). "Outreach" is particularly effective.&#13;
27.       Even where poverty persists, services offering safe and effective&#13;
contraceptives conveniently and with sensitivity to culture do appeal, as&#13;
in Indonesia and Thailand. Here too community-based "outreach" (in&#13;
conjunction with some development progress) seems key. Outreach is also&#13;
promising in less conducive settings, including Bangladesh and India. In&#13;
Africa and the Near East, extending services may be still more difficult.&#13;
Nonetheless, services have impact even when demand is limited by poverty&#13;
and culture if they provide several family planning methods and information&#13;
on appropriate use through community-based outreach.&#13;
28.       Most donors consider such family planning programs attractive on&#13;
cost grounds. Establishing basic health services including family planning&#13;
now costs roughly $5-20 per capita population. (Family planning alone&#13;
accounts for perhaps 25% of this.) The average cost per active user of&#13;
family planning alone seems to fall within twenty dollars. (Marginal costs&#13;
tend to be higher in early stages, thin fall until existing demand is more&#13;
or less satisfied, when they may rise--though this varies.) Most family&#13;
planning costs recur (salaries, contraceptives), and many are "local".&#13;
While donors and channels help cover such costs, their willingness may&#13;
erode as requests for population assistance increase--and as demand grows&#13;
for broader health care.&#13;
29.       Donors remain concerned, however, that family planning programs&#13;
be voluntary, safe, and culturally attuned. Several donors encourage that&#13;
family planning be provided with broader maternal and child health&#13;
services, to improve the appeal and the quality of family planning&#13;
services. As determining appropriate balance among services is difficult&#13;
when health-care budgets are tight and health care is scarce, support for&#13;
more focused family planning programs also exists. Substantial research&#13;
has been funded to improve contraceptive technology and to improve delivery&#13;
of family planning services, often in conjunction with broader health care.&#13;
30.        If donors believe population assistance is wanted, if they&#13;
believe no one else will step in to help, and if they believe population&#13;
assistance works reasonably well, then they may be more willing to increase&#13;
it beyond the current 1-2% of ODA. Rising requests for population&#13;
assistance throughout the third world and the growing evidence of its&#13;
effectiveness have helped sustain population assistance. Donors are aware&#13;
that less than 40% of couples in the third-world outside China now have&#13;
reasonable regular access to reliable and affordable family planning. This&#13;
level of service costs somewhat over $1 billion--roughly $500 million from&#13;
assistance--and is associated with an average birth rate of about 37. But&#13;
future assistance is hard to predict given "aid fatigue" and controversy&#13;
surrounding population assistance particularly in the United States.&#13;
31.        This paper is intended to serve as a reference on "population&#13;
assistance" and is organized into sections covering particular donors,&#13;
channel organizations, etc.&#13;

CHAPTER I&#13;
POPULATION ASSISTANCE FLOWS&#13;
A. Sources of Assistance for Population&#13;
1.01       In 1981, (the latest available year) Official Development&#13;
Assistance from governments for population reached about $374 million,&#13;
almost all from the 17 countries of the OECD's Development Assistance&#13;
Committee (DAC). This is about 1.5% of total DAC Official Development&#13;
Assistance of about $26 billion. Population assistance has never accounted&#13;
for more than about 2% of DAC ODA. Beyond this, the World Bank provides&#13;
some population assistance. The U.S. Ford and Rockefeller Foundations also&#13;
provide some resources for population but receive no ODA. As Table 1.1&#13;
shows, total population assistance froa DAC ODA, the World Bank, the two&#13;
foundations, and other minor sources reached some $491 million in 1981.&#13;
This study focuses on the portion that government provide, about&#13;
three-fourths of the total.&#13;
1.02      The United States is by far the leading donor, providing over&#13;
half--about $193 million in 1981 (on expenditure basis) and $211 million in&#13;
1982 (on a commitment basis). Japan, Norway and Sweden provided over $30&#13;
million; Germany ranked next at $23 million. The Nordic countries are&#13;
traditionally leading supporters of population assistance and together&#13;
provided almost $75 million in 1981. Japan and Germany have become major&#13;
supporters recently. (See Chart 1.1.)&#13;

1.03       The trend in population assistance (expressed in current dollars)&#13;
has been rising at about 11% annually over 1971-1982, with a drop in 1980-81.&#13;
(See Chart 1.2.) But in real terms it climbed until 1979 and then slipped&#13;
by 1982 to only 10% above the 1971 level, implying average annual growth&#13;
over 1971-1982 of only about 3%. (See Chart 1.3.)&#13;

1.04      While U.S. assistance climbed, other donors' assistance climbed&#13;
faster, so that the U.S. share gradually declined to roughly 40%. Japan's&#13;
assistance rose dramatically (from $2.1 million in 1971 to $33.4 million in&#13;
1981 and a reported $42.6 million in 1982). The Nordic countries, Canada,&#13;
West Germany, and the Netherlands all increased their commitments as well.&#13;
Most recently, however, assistance from the United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway,&#13;
Denmark, West Germany, and other donors declined somewhat in dollar terms.&#13;
(This partly reflects adjustments in exchange rates as the dollar gained&#13;
strength.)&#13;
1.05      Population assistance has lost ground to other forms of develop-&#13;
ment assistance which have outpaced its growth. "Level of effort", meaning&#13;
the fraction of ODA devoted to population assistance, declined erratically&#13;
from about 2% in the early 1970's to only 1.3% in 1980, 1.45% in 1981.&#13;
(See Chart 1.4.) Norway traditionally leads in level of effort, with a&#13;
high of about 11% in 1976, but declined to about 6.9% in 1981. (See Chart&#13;
1.5.) Sweden traditionally ranks second, with a high of 6.4%, but slipped&#13;
to about 3.4% recently. The United States--the major donor--traditionally&#13;
ranks third at 2-4% and is at 3.4% recently. Despite Japan's increases,&#13;
its population assistance still constitutes only 1% of its ODA, which has&#13;
also risen rapidly. Germany's level of effort has fluctuated and recently&#13;
is about .7%. The United Kingdom has maintained about 1% until 1981 when&#13;
it fell to .6%. On balance, some traditional leading donors have slipped&#13;
in "level of effort," and others have only partly compensated.&#13;

B. Channels of Population Assistance&#13;
1.06      Donor nations route official population assistance to recipient&#13;
nations through three main kinds of channels-&#13;
-- Multilateral channels, principally the United Nations Fund for&#13;
Population Activities and other U.N. organizations;&#13;
--   Private channels D particularly the International Planned&#13;
Parenthood Federation and other non-profit organizations;&#13;
Bilateral channels l/ particularly the government-to goverment&#13;
programs of the United States and other major providers of&#13;
official population assistanceo&#13;
1.07      The main routes of assistance from donor to recipient nations are&#13;
sketched out in Chart 1.6.&#13;

1008      Roughly one-third of official development assistance for&#13;
population goes through the UNFPA channel. About one-fourth goes through&#13;
the major private organizations (closer to a third if additional private&#13;
intermediaries are included)o The remainder goes through bilateral&#13;
channels.&#13;
1/  Technically, "bilateral" can mean several different things. The&#13;
broadest definition is any ODA not channeled through U.N. Institutions&#13;
or the Multilateral Development Banks, This includes&#13;
government-to-government programs and funding for private organizations&#13;
like IPPF or universities or CARE, etc0 The narrowest is just the&#13;
government-to-government portion. Here "bilateral" means ODA for&#13;
population not going through UNFPA (or other UN organizations      a few&#13;
donors count some UNICEF contributions as "population assistance") and&#13;
not going through the five major private organizations0 This&#13;
"bilateral" assistance is thus largely government-to-government but&#13;
includes some research, training, and other efforts0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
1.09      The major multilateral channel for official population assistance&#13;
is the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA). Germany,&#13;
Japan and the Netherlands contribute most of their population assistance&#13;
through UNFPA, and most others except the United States contribute at least&#13;
one third. The United States is nonetheless UNFPA's leading donor,&#13;
contributing about one-sixth of its population assistance to cover about&#13;
one-fourth of UNFPA's program. UNFPA's other leading donors include the&#13;
Nordic countries, Germany and Japan, though some 90 nations each contribute&#13;
something. Recently UNFPA's annual budget has averaged roughly $130&#13;
million. It operates in some 127 countries in every region of the world.&#13;
UNFPA is a politically acceptable source to all countries. It is flexible&#13;
in what it will fund and makes grants rather than loans. It can assist in&#13;
a variety of population-related fields, such as primary health care that&#13;
includes family planning, public information, demography and census-taking,&#13;
and policy development, though it spends about two-fifths of its program&#13;
funds on family planning and related health services.     It devotes about&#13;
two-thirds of its resources to some 53 priority" countries (based&#13;
primarily on need). It often uses other U.N. agencies, including WHO and&#13;
UNICEF, as "executing agencies" for projects it funds, though some&#13;
governments act as their own executing agencies (and sometimes involve&#13;
local private organizations).&#13;
1.10      WHO, UNICEF, and other U.N. agencies -- FAO, ILO, UNESCO -- are&#13;
increasingly engaged in population-related activities, often through&#13;
linkages with UNFPA, but sometimes using their own resources. But while&#13;
many other U.N. organizations may fund activities that bear in some way on&#13;
population, UNFPA has the most direct impact. Unless otherwise noted, this&#13;
study treats UNFPA as the U.N. channel for population assistance.&#13;
1.11      The major organizations that constitute the private channel&#13;
include the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), Family&#13;
Planning International Assistance (FPIA), Pathfinder Fund, the Association&#13;
for Voluntary Sterilization (AVS), and the Population Council. IPPF is&#13;
actually a loose worldwide federation of indigenous private family planning&#13;
associations in over 100 nations.     (Even China has an affiliation with&#13;
IPPF, through a parastatal organization.) The developing countries' family&#13;
planning associations spend roughly $90 million annually on efforts to&#13;
establish family planning services, information, and supportive public&#13;
policy. They raise over one-third of their funds, from sales of contracep-&#13;
tives and services, from their own governments, from private donations,&#13;
etc. Most of the rest (almost $50 million) comes from contributions o.-&#13;
official development assistance to IPPF headquarters, which then makes&#13;
grants to the FPAs. Some 25 countries contribute official population&#13;
assistance to IPPF, collectively over one-third of what they contribute to&#13;
UNFPA. The leading donors are the United States, Japan, Sweden, United&#13;
Kingdom, and Norway. FPIA is a branch of the Planned Parenthood Federation&#13;
of America (the U.S. IPPF affiliate). It works with private organizations&#13;
and governments in developing countries to introduce family planning in&#13;
innovative ways and often in difficult circumstances.     Its annual program,&#13;
recently about $16 million, is funded largely by the United States. It is&#13;
most active in Bangladesh, Brazil, Mexico, the Philippines, and Thailand.&#13;
Pathfinder is a small American foundation, again funded largely by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
United States.   Its annual program level is abou' $7 million.   -'t&#13;
specializes in modest "pathfinding" efforts to establish family planning&#13;
services and build public support fo. population and fam.ily planning,&#13;
working with private third-world institutions and occasionally&#13;
governments.  AVS, again supported largely by the United States, works to&#13;
introduce and extend safe and voluntary steri..zation, also thL-cugh local&#13;
institutions. Its annual program level is abcult $10 million. Thne&#13;
Population Council, with broader funding, concentrates on building interest&#13;
in and support for population and famfly qlanni'ng and improving family&#13;
planning methods and service delivery. Its annual program level is about&#13;
$15 milliono&#13;
1o12      The United States has the largest bilateral program..    ts&#13;
official development assistance for population now averages a&amp;ocut $200&#13;
million annually, of which roughly one-third goes to&#13;
government-to-government programs.   (One-sixth goes to UFPA, one-fourth to&#13;
the five major private organizations, and one-fourth to univers4ties and&#13;
other private organizations for research and other xiorld-wide programs.)&#13;
In addition the U.S. provides some population assistance to Egy')t from&#13;
"Economic Support Funds".   Other countries with substantial bl'ateral&#13;
programs include the United Kingdom (largely in Commonwealth cc^untries of&#13;
Asia), Norway, Sweden (now only in Bangladesh znd Kenya), Japan (largely in&#13;
Asia), and Germany.&#13;
1.13      Table 1.02 shows population assistance by source and chiannel.&#13;
RECIPIENTS OF POPULATION ASSISTANCE&#13;
1.14      Population assistance flows from "channels" to recipient count-&#13;
ries in two ways:   in "global" or "`nterregional" programs with some theme,&#13;
like biomedical research, that operate in several countri.es or in programs&#13;
designed for particular countries.   Roughly two- hirds of all population&#13;
assistance has gone to the country programs in recent years. (See Table&#13;
130.)  Asia, with two-thirds of the third-world population excluding China,&#13;
got just over half the regional assistance anc' about a third of the total.&#13;
Africa, with about a fifth of the population (tXreating Egypt as Near East),&#13;
got about 15% of the country assistance but .ess than one tentTL of the&#13;
total.  Latin America, with about 14% of the population (excluding Vene-&#13;
zuela and Argentina), got about one' fifth o- the country assistance and 13%&#13;
of the total. The Middle East, Medditerranean, and Europe gct about 14% of&#13;
country and 9% of the total.   Earlier consIstent data are scarcez, But&#13;
available data from UNFPA, IPPF, and USAT_D--'which account focr elout&#13;
four-fifths of population assistance net cf double-counting--do show a&#13;
gradual increase in Africa's share, conti'nuing h:igh shares in A5ia, and&#13;
fluctuations elsewhere.   Most donors and all channels are trying to&#13;
concentrate assistance in poorer regions and particularly to increase&#13;
assistance to Africa.o But opportunities to az5ist effectively remain&#13;
limited in AOfrica and the Near East, much greater .n Asia and parts of&#13;
Latin America.  The regional allocation ref..ecta copromIse, wiftli much&#13;
still going to poorer Asian countries where opportunI1ties are more&#13;
plentiful.&#13;

1.17       Table 1.5 shows assistance by channel and destination.         Over half&#13;
of Africa's assistance comes through UNFPA and one-third through the&#13;
private organiat4ons. Bilateral programs account for just over one-sixth.&#13;
About two-fifths of Asia's assistance comes through UNFPA, almost half&#13;
through bilateral programs, and the remainder through private&#13;
organizations. About two-fifths of Latin America's assistance comes&#13;
through UNFPA, over two-fifths through private organizations, and the&#13;
remainder bilaterally. As to the Middle East, etc., one-third comes&#13;
through UNFPA, half bilaterally, and the remainder through private&#13;
organizations. Thus UNFPA accounts for the largest share--at least&#13;
two-fifths--of assistance flowing to Africa and substantial shares in all&#13;
other regions. Private organizations provide about one-third of assistance&#13;
to Africa and lead in Latin America at almost half. Bilateral programs&#13;
lead (providing about half) in Asia and the Middle East.&#13;

1.18      It would be interesting to see at a glance the flow of population&#13;
assistance from source nations through major channels to recipient nations&#13;
grouped by region. This can only be done notionally. One organization's&#13;
ixpenditure is another's income, time lapses before income is spent on&#13;
actual programs, fiscal years differ, and even definitions of what is&#13;
population assisance differ among donors and recipients. The attached&#13;
Table 1.6 thus indicates orders of magnitude roughly, for 1980. The&#13;
pattern has probably not changed much.&#13;
C. Functional Categories of Population Assistance&#13;
1.19      Population assistance is traditionally divided into several broad&#13;
(and sometimes overlapping) categories:&#13;
--   family planning services is the principal category, accounting&#13;
for about two-thirds of population assistance. It comprises technical&#13;
advice on design and management of family planning programs, provision of&#13;
contraceptives and related medical equipment, training for personnel (or&#13;
more usually for trainers of personnel), and financial support for actual&#13;
operations and evaluations. Sometimes "closely related" maternal and child&#13;
health services or health infrastructure is included, with no unanimity on&#13;
where to draw the line. Related research is also included;&#13;
--   information, education and communication (IEC) to build support&#13;
for family planning and interest in population issues among the public and&#13;
its leaders and to inform family planning users about child-spacing (links&#13;
to health, possible methods, etc.);&#13;
--   demographic analysis including basic data collection and&#13;
"population dynamics" analyzing demographic trends;&#13;
--   policy analysis, covering efforts to develop and implement&#13;
policies affecting population (thus including some social science research&#13;
that may relate to operations research);&#13;
--   broader special or "multisectoral efforts".&#13;
1.20      UNFPA estimates that roughly two-thirds of population assistance&#13;
worldwide goes for family planning programs and "related" health measures,&#13;
about one-fifth for official development assistance policy development and&#13;
related demographics, over one-tenth for "multisector" activities, and only&#13;
5% for IEC and special programs (1981 expenditure data). (See Table 1.7,&#13;
which uses the "broad definition" of assistance including World Bank and&#13;
Ford and Rockefeller as well as ODA.) Over the past decade, family&#13;
planning (and related health services) have accounted for two-thirds to&#13;
three-fourths of the total.   Demographic data collection and analysis&#13;
accounted for a higher share several years ago (when first censuses and&#13;
related efforts were getting underway in Africa and elsewhere).    Why&#13;
countries request various types of assistance and trends in actual&#13;
assistance are discussed in Chapter III.&#13;

RATIONALES F'OR POPULATION ASSISTANCE&#13;
2.01       Support for development assistance of any kind is limited in many&#13;
donor countries, including some that nonetheless provide the bulk of&#13;
assistance today. Population assistance, which goes largely to "population&#13;
programs" that extend family planning in the third world, is sometimes&#13;
especially controversial.   This reflects not only skepticism about foreign&#13;
aid, but disagreement about the need for lower birth rates and about family&#13;
planning itself in some donor nations. While population assistance is&#13;
increasingly considered effective and family planning has generally grown&#13;
more acceptable in donor nations over the past decade, controversy&#13;
persists. Controversy is particularly strong now in the United States, long&#13;
the leading donor. In the Nordic countries, however, population assistance&#13;
commands stronger support.l/&#13;
2.02       Some advocates of population assistance believe the very future&#13;
of the world, the preservation of its resources and natural endowment, and&#13;
any hope of its now poverty-stricken peoples to achieve decent living&#13;
standards depend on success in curbing population growth. Some critics&#13;
deny even the existence of a significant "world population problem" or&#13;
believe that development will nonetheless occur (at least if economic&#13;
policies are sound) and naturally create demand for smaller families&#13;
without specially directed "population programs." Other critics suspect&#13;
such programs of coercive and unsafe impositions on unsuspecting peoples.&#13;
Finally, outright opponents regard some family planning methods spread&#13;
through population programs as immoral.&#13;
2.03       These are polar views, of course, but they evoke the deepest&#13;
issues associated with population assistance. Actually, those same issues&#13;
arise in both recipient and donor countries, differing only in level of&#13;
emphasis and concern from one country to another in either category. The&#13;
same rationales for "population programs" and assistance, and the same&#13;
reactions to the rationales and to the resulting programs, are evident in&#13;
many countries.&#13;
A. Rationales for "Population" Programs and Assistance&#13;
2.04       The concerns that motivate sponsors of "population programs" in&#13;
developing nations and supporters of population assistance in developed&#13;
nations emerge in four priaary rationales by which they advocate or justify&#13;
those programs. These relate to (1) mitigating a drag on economic develop-&#13;
ment, k2) living within environmental and resource limitations of a finite&#13;
1/   Support for development assistance tends to be stronger in the Nordic&#13;
countries and the Netherlands. These countries provide a higher share&#13;
of GNP for assistance (approaching 1% in come cases) but, with their&#13;
smaller GNPs, absolute levels of assistance are naturally lower than&#13;
for larger countries providing a smaller share of GNP. See, e.g., IDA&#13;
in Retrospect, World bank, Washington, 1982.&#13;

natural heritage, (3) improving maternal and child health, and (4)&#13;
improving opportunities for women.&#13;
10 Development Drag&#13;
2.05       The most powerful rationale for population assistance is probably&#13;
the conviction that projected population growth will retard or swamp&#13;
efforts to raise tnird-world living standards--that slowing population&#13;
growth will substantially facilitate development progress0-/&#13;
2.06       The simplest form of this concern iaay be the most powerful.    It&#13;
arises when those struggling to produce improvements in living standards&#13;
for existing populations contemplate the numbers that would be added to&#13;
those populations at present or likely future growth rates0 The U.S. State&#13;
Department chart below illustrates its view in recent years of the&#13;
situation; other donors and developing country leaders often share a&#13;
similar view, though no unanimity exists on what demographic projections&#13;
are most defensible and individual donors' views change0&#13;
20U7      To improve living standards while simultaneously prov:;ding for&#13;
these additional numbers may seem a herculean task in countries where&#13;
already many are unemployed or underemployed, crowding into already teeming&#13;
urban slums, and living not much beyond subsistence. If the economy&#13;
succeeds in producing a surplus beyond what is needed to maintain 14ving&#13;
standards for the current population, the surplus cannot all finance&#13;
investment to improve living standards0 Given political realities and&#13;
humanitarian concern, much of it must go for the needs of the added&#13;
millions0 This is a theme recurrent in the docuaents of many donor&#13;
governments developing courntry and Bank studies including the recent World&#13;
Development Report03/&#13;
2.08      14ore technically, but at an unsophisticated level, a nation's&#13;
percentage growth in income translates into per capita growth only after&#13;
growth in population has been subtracted0 Indeed, population is the deno-&#13;
minator of all those per capita ratios that measure living standards,&#13;
educational progress, and development success0     Population growth therefore&#13;
subtracts from whatever growth has been achieved in the numerators measur-&#13;
ing per capita trends, which in important cases are heading down on this&#13;
oasis0 Actual declines in available food per capita in Africa has caused&#13;
special worry0 Levels of investment needed to achieve literacy targets,&#13;
health-care coverage, or access to clean water have caused concern among&#13;
donors as well as the developing countries involved, sometimes generating&#13;
doubt in some donor constituencies that much improvement in living&#13;

standards can really be achieved. Again this point recurs in donor&#13;
government statements.4/&#13;
2.09      Rapid population growth may also slow development by saddling a&#13;
society witn a large "burden of dependency". It produces an age structure&#13;
like tnat illustrated in the lower half of Chart 2.2, in which children&#13;
constitute a disproportionate share of the population. Children are&#13;
dependent and essentially unproductive for ten to twenty years, but require&#13;
nourishment, education, and other support, thus consuming much of the out-&#13;
put of the worKing-age fraction of the population--a fraction much smaller&#13;
than in nations with less rapidly growing populations, as illustrated in&#13;
the upper half of Chart 2.2. If such children are not able to thrive, get&#13;
education and their ultimately jobs, some fear the result may be increased&#13;
political instability. M4oreover, the bottom-heavy age distribution tends&#13;
to "build in" yet inore population growth for the future, since the next&#13;
generation of parents will be considerably larger than the current one.&#13;
The United States and the United Kingdom have emphasized such "population&#13;
momentum" )/&#13;
2.10      A more technical version of the development rationale (but one&#13;
more likely to generate technical debate) involves "diminishing returns to&#13;
labor": the more labor a country applies to "given supplies" of natural&#13;
resources and capital, the less the marginal laborer will contribute. This&#13;
translates into reduced total product per capita, hence into reduced per&#13;
capita income and living standards. Diminishing returns to labor is&#13;
another recurrent theme in policy statements of major donors. Dimainishing&#13;
returns would be forestalled, of course, if on balance the increased labor&#13;
more than commensurately led to increased natural resources, increased&#13;
capital, or improved technology and thereby to increased total output.&#13;
Mloreover, policies more conducive to free trade and efficient operation of&#13;
domestic factor and product markets can stimulate faster economic growth.&#13;
The rejoinder is, however, that at least in prevailing third world&#13;
conditions, much of this is not likely to happen. Political pressures&#13;
(domestic protectionism) thus far constrain free trade and inhibit LDC&#13;
access to developed country markets. On the production side, rapidly&#13;
increasing populations tend more to degrade natural resources than to&#13;
enhance thema, rapidly increasing populations tend more to reduce savings&#13;
and capital more than they increase them, as people and governments use&#13;
what might otherwise be surpluses to care for the added members of their&#13;
families or constituencies; and rapidly increasing populations seem as&#13;
likely to retard technical change by restraining the investment necessary&#13;
to introduce new technology, by holding down educational levels, and by&#13;
perpetuating traditional fatalistic attitudes that typically accompany&#13;

increasing specialization of labor, or otherwise permitting economies of&#13;
scale06/&#13;
20 Growth Limits&#13;
2.11       Taken far enough, of course, this diminishing returns argument&#13;
becomes the neo-Malthusianism of those who believe that rapid population&#13;
growth and attempts at still more rapid production growth are heading the&#13;
world toward global disaster. Others emphasize the circumstances of indi-&#13;
vidual countries, which may, of course, spill over to others. And others9&#13;
while not endorsing the "global disaster view," express serious concern&#13;
over present and probable future pressures on natural resources. Tnis&#13;
rationale thus brings to the support of population programs and assistance&#13;
not only those concerned primarily with development and welfare of third-&#13;
world peoples, but the increasingly powerful (and already overlapping)&#13;
groups concerned with preservation of the environment.&#13;
2.12       The champions of the growth-limits rationale do so at various&#13;
levels of sophisticationo Most recognize that accumulation of capital and,&#13;
above all, tecnnical change have thus far given the lie to Malthus at least&#13;
in the developed third of the world0 Their response is that we now face&#13;
utterly different circumstances in w^hich technical change is likely to be&#13;
overwhelmed and further capital formation inhibited or even halted by the&#13;
current "explosion" of the world's population, illustrated in Chart 201&#13;
from the U.S. State Department docunent0    The most recent major expression&#13;
of this concern was the Global 2000 Report issued in the late days of the&#13;
Carter Administration in the United States (but not accepted by the current&#13;
Reagan Administration)0   Many otners could be cited, of whaich the Club of&#13;
Rome's The Limits to Growth are among the best known07/&#13;
2.13      The "population explosion" and accompanying explosion of human&#13;
demands are seen as likely to exhaust easily available natural resources,&#13;
ruin the environment, and severely stra-n the capacities of human societies&#13;
for social and political adjustment0 In most versions these forces are&#13;

seen as at work already and evident in such phenomena as famines, urban&#13;
favellas, "desertification" of arid areas, erosion of mountainous ones,&#13;
poaching on game parks, laying waste of tropical forests, inflation,&#13;
unemploymaent, wars, and so on.&#13;
2.14      In this view, natural resources are ultimately if not immediately&#13;
limited, if only because "spaceslhip earth is itself finite. Supplies of&#13;
petroleum, coal, metals, and other minerals are seen as ultimately limited,&#13;
if only as the highest quality and most accessible reserves are used up and&#13;
remaining reserves becomae more and more costly to exploit. The key biolo-&#13;
gical resources--fisheries, forests, grasslands, and croplands--are seen as&#13;
limited, declining, and difficult at best to replace. Indeed, a further&#13;
rear is that the carrying capacities of these biological resources are or&#13;
shortly will be exceeded and the resources themselves depleted by&#13;
overfishing, overcutting, overgrazing, and overcropping. They point to&#13;
denuding of the Himalayan foothills and consequent erosion into the valley&#13;
of tne Brahmaputra, disappearance of tropical forest, "desertification" in&#13;
the Sahel and elsewhere, and erosion or exhaustion of cropland as evidence&#13;
of these developments. In some cases, technical change and massive&#13;
investment are considered possible antidotes, while in others permanent or&#13;
nearly irreversible damage is feared. Of particular concern to&#13;
environmental groups and some scienties are threats to other species of&#13;
animals and plants and to wilderness.&#13;
2.15       As population grows rapidly, the growth-limits groups say, the&#13;
resulting demands on limited resources will reduce per capita supplies of&#13;
food, fuel, and other goods, reversing the economic progress of recent&#13;
decades. Already, they point out, the per capita catch of oceanic fish has&#13;
started to decline, other global trends in quality of water or air, soil&#13;
erosion, and quantity and quality of forest cover have flattened, and&#13;
adverse trends have appeared in individual continents and nations.&#13;
2.16       They anticipate that per capita food supplies and real standards&#13;
of living will soon level off and even decline in many countries, rather&#13;
than Just the current few.   They also see the quality of life otherwise&#13;
adversely impacted by personal stresses and social disruption accompanying&#13;
greater crowding in cities and other living areas. They predict increasing&#13;
social and political disruption and disorganization, up to and including&#13;
war and revolution--and they press these predictions in official&#13;
circles.8/&#13;
2.17      Adherents to this view believe the current exponential population&#13;
growth is bound before long to slow and stop as the limits to growth are&#13;
reached because of resource limitation and exhaustion, environmental&#13;
damage, and social and political disruption. They argue, however, that the&#13;
world would be far better off to achieve this sooner, when there is still&#13;
hope for achieving better lives for the world's existing millions, rather&#13;
than later, and to achieve it through a decline in fertility rather than an&#13;

increase in mortality. Hence their .impassioned support for population&#13;
programs and assistance09/&#13;
2.18      Some of these groups also support strict immigration control in&#13;
their own countries. Several developed countries are experienc-'ng heavy&#13;
immigration across their borders from third-world countries undergoing&#13;
rapid population growth. In the United States, "or example, ImxigraEion&#13;
from Mexico and Central America in particular has come ln a flccd and&#13;
caused great concern and debate. Germany, Sweden, and Britai.n e'so have&#13;
substantial immigration0 Some population groups have become significant&#13;
advocates for tougher immigration controls0 Others regard that as an&#13;
ultimately futile beggar-my-neighbor policy0&#13;
2.19      Of course, the limits-to-growth a-rgumeat is controve7Eial, and it&#13;
has its vigorous debunkers0l0/   Actually estimating supplies of "exploit-&#13;
able natural resources" has proved difficult as newJ sources are discovered;&#13;
some argue resources suffice to support rapid enough development, if&#13;
efficient economic policies are pursued, to reduce desired fam`ily size and&#13;
thus avoid any environmental disaster0   Actually modeling globz3&#13;
development--encompassing not only complicated economic intercc-:ions but&#13;
also complicated economic-physical interactions--has also proved nighly&#13;
difficult0  But the limits to growJth idea has d2finltely affected popula-&#13;
tion policy and politics in the United States, United iCtnadom, and other&#13;
donor countries0   With its global imoplications, 9it speaks more directly to&#13;
the interests of developed-country constituencies than the otner rationales&#13;
for population assistance, which appeal primarIly to humanitarfen Instincts&#13;
or calculations of quite long range political aDd economic interest0&#13;
2.20 2oreover, many who may reject the most apocalyptic ve-.sions of&#13;
the growth-limits hypothesis are nonetheless concerned with current deve-&#13;
lopmental, resource and environmental problems such as declining per capita&#13;
food production in much of Africa, rapid urbanizetion and consequent&#13;
degradation in much of Asia and Latin America, and denuding of the Himala-&#13;
yas, and social unrest that they believe are related to populet,on&#13;
growth011/  They may accept that arresting growth of the world&amp;s popula-&#13;
tion, at least for tne time being, wilL free resources to address poverty,&#13;
malnutrition, and human degradation that plague many of the weorld's&#13;

ciple, family planning gets support because delaying and spacing pregnan-&#13;
cies can help substantially to preserve the health of both mothers and&#13;
children. This is perhaps the most widely espoused rationale, at least&#13;
publicly, for population assistance among donor and recipient nations.12/&#13;
2.22       The United States, Nordic countries, and the major channel&#13;
organizations all particularly emphasize that when couples have little&#13;
control over fertility, normal risks of pregnancy to mother and child are&#13;
aggravated.13/ Childbearing in the teens, before the mother has completed&#13;
her physical development or whatever education is available to her, affects&#13;
her subsequent economic prospects and her health. Early pregnancies also&#13;
tend to produce weak, low birth-weight babies.    Other births may follow&#13;
quickly, and short birth intervals sap maternal health further and tend to&#13;
produce weak babies.14/ Several donors have funded a "World Fertility&#13;
Survey" that now shows short birth intervals often raise the risk of infant&#13;
mortality ceteris paribus by 50%-100X, a finding of major interest to&#13;
donors as well as developing countries. As the number of births mounts and&#13;
as mothers age, pregnancy and childbirth are thought to become more&#13;
hazardous and more likely to result in a malformed or undernourished child.&#13;
2.23      Donior policy papers, e.g., from the United States and United&#13;
Kingdom, stress that problems associated with high fertility seriously&#13;
aggravate broader health problems associated with malnutrition, unsafe&#13;
drinking water, poor sanitation, disease, and inadequate medical care.&#13;
USAID describes a "vicious circle": A young, poorly nourished, possibly&#13;
diseased, mother has a weak baby; the baby cannot nurse effectively,&#13;
weakens, and succumbs to common respiratory or diarrheal infections. With&#13;
the termination of lactation another pregnancy quickly ensues, straining&#13;
the mother's health further, and the next baby may be born even weaker.15/.&#13;
2.24       Family planning services can mitigate these problems by delaying&#13;
pregnancy, facilitating spacing of pregnancies, and allowing an end to&#13;
childbearing when the desired family is complete.lb/ Mlost donors, led by&#13;

the Nordic countries, proaote family planning as part of maternal ard chi-d&#13;
health care or perhaps broader "primary health care" designed -0: break the&#13;
destructive cycle of malnutrition, disease, uncontrolled ferti'.ity, and&#13;
other accompaniments of poverty t'nat perpetuate poverty and ill heal tho&#13;
But most donors are also concerned about what mix of services is&#13;
appropriate, about how to assure sufficient priority to family planning&#13;
particularly vis-a-vis curative services for acute needs. Thus several&#13;
donors, including the United States and some Nordic countries, stress the&#13;
need for sufficient attention to family planning when it is embedded in&#13;
broader health programs017/    The major channel organizations usually&#13;
focus more on family planning but support family planning with:'n broader&#13;
primary health care funded from other sourcesl1 /&#13;
2025      A related threat to health--a major one in many cour-ries--is&#13;
septic abortion. Particularly where family planning services are scarce,&#13;
many women are driven to terminate pregnancies by abortion, often clandes&#13;
tine and priwtive019/   The hemorrhage and infection that frequently ensue&#13;
cause much sterility, and death. Family planning programs are seen as&#13;
obviating this extreme and unsafe means of controlling fertili.ty0   Thus it&#13;
was physicians alarmed at the consequences they had seen in Brozilian&#13;
hospitals and clinics from crude and clandestine abortions per-Formed in&#13;
unsterile conditions who started Brazil's principal family planning organ-&#13;
zationi  Studies in Chile showing declines in abortion follow0ing provision&#13;
of family planning have also been influential in some donor ci7cles0    Donor&#13;
nations seldom make this argument explicitly in policy papers, but the&#13;
argument comes up publicly; channel organizations, notably IPPY, emphasize&#13;
it_20/&#13;
2.26      This concern with maternal and child health arises not from&#13;
humanitarian instincts alone0 It is also driven by development considera-&#13;
tions and conforms to current development strategies0&#13;
2.27      For a time the prevailing w^lisdom was that living stendards could&#13;
best be improved through investment to expand physical capital, counting on&#13;
the resulting economic growth to provide jobs, income, and more abundant&#13;
goods and services for everyone0 Development assistance went primarily to&#13;
provide capital for investment in agriculture, industry, and -'nfrastruct-&#13;
ure0 But many donors became disillusioned with this strategy, believing it&#13;

did little for the "poor majority" in near or medium term.21/     It also&#13;
made incomplete use of the productive capacity inherent in the extensive&#13;
labor supply they potentially represent. This encouraged development&#13;
assistance donors to give more weight to "basic needs", particularly of the&#13;
poor. The United States, United Kingdom, and Nordic countries particularly&#13;
emphasized this shift.22/ Besides tapping the humanitarian instinct that&#13;
underlies such strategies, this recognizes the reality that human capital&#13;
may be as important to development as physical capital--particularly in&#13;
nations wnere comparative advantage lies in labor-intensive enterprises.&#13;
Health, including maternal and child health, is necessarily a focus of such&#13;
"basic needs" strategies, as these donors stress.    And family planning and&#13;
other population programs fit right in.23/&#13;
4. Women's Opportunities&#13;
2.28      Allied with the concern for maternal and child health as a&#13;
motivation for "population assistance is a concern for the rights and&#13;
welfare of women--which provides impetus for the disproportionate numbers&#13;
of women involved in family planning and "population" issues in developing&#13;
and developed nations. Several donors, notably the United States, the&#13;
Nordic countries, and United Kingdom, and UNFPA, IFFP, and Pathfinder, see&#13;
family planning as a key means of enabling women to seize broader&#13;
opportunities.24/ While support for programs to improve women's&#13;
opportunities remains limited, it is increasing in many countries in the&#13;
developed and developing world and among international organizations.&#13;
2.29       Women's lack of control over their lives in many traditional&#13;
societies makes the term "women's liberation" seem no hyperbole. In&#13;
various parts of the world women are subjected to "female circumcision" as&#13;
little girls; married and sent to live under the control of their&#13;
mothers-in-law in their early teens; confined largely to home and so unable&#13;
to go to market on their own; required to face the wall in the presence of&#13;
men outside their families; barred from owning property by law or tradition&#13;
and hence also unable to pledge it for credit; liable to be divorced at&#13;
will with no rights to child support or alimony; and quite likely in any&#13;
case to be left by their husbands with large families to care for.25/&#13;
Extended-family traditions that supported both men and women have often&#13;

broken down in the wake of industrialization and urbanization, leaving&#13;
women more on their own and often more vulnerable. Land reform and&#13;
agricultural modernization have also sometimes exacerbated problems of&#13;
landlessness and otherwise harmed the already poor woman0     In Bangladesh,&#13;
for example, roughly a third of all poor households are headed by women.&#13;
2.30       Conditions are, of course, less extreme for most women0    Still,&#13;
more often than not female sex remains an inferior status. W'lomen may&#13;
be "esteemed" yet at a disadvantage in getting the health care, education&#13;
technical assistance, adequate wages, or credit026/    Women sometimes&#13;
apparently fail to achieve their share of economic development, especially&#13;
as cash income becomes more important.&#13;
2.31      UNFPA, IPPF, and several donors emphasize that early and&#13;
continuous childbearing contributes centrally to perpetuation of women's&#13;
restricted status027/    Early marriage and onset of pregnancy followed by&#13;
continued childbearing and heavy child-care responsibllities may foreclose&#13;
further education for women or employment outside the home or homestead0&#13;
2.32      Thus, to help a woman gain control over her fertility is to help&#13;
her gain control over her life0 If a woman can plan pregnancy it becomes&#13;
easier for her to seize broader.educational, employment, and social oppor-&#13;
tunities. In the process she isay shed the fatalistic outlook that makes&#13;
inferior status seem as insuperable fact of life0 Many donors and channels&#13;
thus believe family planning programs and "population" assistance may&#13;
therefore contribute importantly to women's right and welfareo&#13;
2.33      The concern for women's emancipation, like the concern for&#13;
maternal and child health, arises not only from humanitarian instincts or&#13;
"sisterhood", but from development considerations as well0     Development&#13;
experts in donor as in recipient nations have increasingly realized that&#13;
women play a large role in the economies of developing countries0 They&#13;
raise the next generation of "labor", tend to transmit to it w^hatever&#13;
education and modern awareness they have achieved, and are responsible for&#13;
its health. But women not only provide virtually all of the child care, do&#13;
most of the cooking, and fetch most of the wiater and fuel0 Typically they&#13;
do much of the farming as well, and they represent considerable urban labor&#13;
poolo  Where they do acquire some cash income, they are consfdered more&#13;
likely than men to spend it for the welfare of their families0&#13;
2.34       Official interest in "women in development" has therefore&#13;
increased in recent years, leading to an International Women's Year in 1975&#13;
and United Nations conferences on women in that year and in 9g8O28/&#13;
UNFPA and IPPF as well as several major donors helped organize these&#13;
conferenceso Both conferences declared family planning as a "basic rIght",&#13;

a means of improving health, and a way of opening broader opportunities for&#13;
women. Actual Government commitment to improving women's opportunities&#13;
naturally varies, as does derived motivation to extend family planning on&#13;
this basis.&#13;
B. Reactions&#13;
2.35      These then are the four basic rationales for population programs&#13;
and assistance: the development rationale, the growth limits rationales,&#13;
and the maternal and child health rationale, and the women's opportunity&#13;
rationale. They have given rise to substantial "population programs",&#13;
mostly for family planning services and information, in developing&#13;
nations. They have also given rise to significant amounts of "population&#13;
assistance" from the developed nations, as outlined in Chapter I.&#13;
2.36      Yet if these powerful rationales--particularly either or both of&#13;
the first two, which would give population a central role in development&#13;
and in the gloDal future--were fully accepted, one would expect levels of&#13;
effort and expenditure far above those that have actually materialized.&#13;
But the rationales, and the programs they have inspired, have given rise to&#13;
strong offsetting reactions.    These can be grouped into three classes.&#13;
Most powerful are religious and moral reactions against "birth control"&#13;
methods used in "family planning" programs or espoused by the same groups&#13;
who are running or sponsoring such programs. There are also what might be&#13;
called (perhaps overdramatically) anti-imperialist" reactions from some&#13;
who suspect that people in poor countries are being subjected to unsafe&#13;
drugs or devices and "coerced" into accepting contraceptives, steriliza-&#13;
tion, or even abortion by people in rich countris. Finally, there are&#13;
technical reactions from scholars who have reached donor governments to&#13;
argue that population growtlh does not prejudice development of the global&#13;
future.&#13;
Religious and Moral Reactions&#13;
2.37       The moral and religious reactions to family planning programs and&#13;
population assistance are closely linked, perhaps inseparable.&#13;
2.38      Family planning is seen, probably not without somae justification,&#13;
as weakening long prevailing and deeply ingrained beliefs and attitudes&#13;
about sexual activity, sex roles, and family life. Along with related&#13;
social ferment affecting sexual mores and the roles of women (often champ-&#13;
ioned by the same groups that champion family planning), it is accused of&#13;
encouraging sex out of wedlock, affecting the bond between man and wife,&#13;
allowing "selfish" refusal to bring children into the world, or otherwise&#13;
"underraining the family" by weakening traditional religious and cultural&#13;
values.&#13;
2.39       Birth control methods and especially abortion may also violate&#13;
religious or quasi-religious beliefs. The Roman Catholic Church and others&#13;
(many of whom might not regard their views as primarily religious) regard&#13;
abortion as "murder"--termination of human life. Indeed, the Church and&#13;
some allies regard some contraceptive methods, notably intrauterine&#13;
devices, as abortifacients and therefore subject to the same moral objec-&#13;
tion. The official position of the Church, furthenaore, regards all con-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38 -&#13;
traception and avoidance of pregnancy, except by "natural famÂ°7.ly plannfng"&#13;
that involves no artificial drug, device, or procedure, as unacceptable.&#13;
Conservative branches of other major rel:gions have also disccuraged&#13;
contraception, though no unanimity existso    For example, some countries&#13;
where Islam is widely practiced, e.g., Indonesia, favor family planning&#13;
while others do not. Political concerns about size and strength of ethnic&#13;
groups also play a role.&#13;
2.40       The abortion issue, of course, arouses by far the strongest&#13;
passions and political forces. Abortlon is legal on restricted grounds in&#13;
some developing countries0 In reality, most family planning programs in&#13;
the developing countries seldom perform abortions; indeed, they are far&#13;
more likely to prevent them and are sometlmes organized in good part for&#13;
that purpose. Nonetheless, support for family planning progrzms in&#13;
developing nations and population assistance in donor nations is powerfully&#13;
affected by spillover from domestic debate on abortion and related&#13;
issues029/   This happens partly because abortion and "birth control" are&#13;
so closely related (as witness the debate over whether aUDs or "pills" are&#13;
"abortifacients") that feelings toward one tend to become tangled with&#13;
feelings toward the other0 It also happens because some groups that&#13;
support family planning and population assistance also defend a woman's&#13;
"right to choose" wheth,r or not to have an abortion.&#13;
2.41      Opponents of abortion in the United States have obtained legisla-&#13;
tion that prohibits UoS0 population assistance from going to support&#13;
performance of abortions.OI/ In the process these people have become&#13;
highly suspicious of the population assistance program of USAID generally&#13;
and have affected its political stpport0 Most recently they have put on&#13;
considerable pressure, at least to some extent effective, to have the U.S.&#13;
assist only those family planning progrÂ£ms that provide no abortion0&#13;
Others prefer the program emphasipe, or even confine itself to, "natural&#13;
family planning"0   These groups are not always large in numbers, but their&#13;
moral fervor and political activism make them a considerable force to be&#13;
reckoned witho Situations in other donor nations varyo In the Nordic&#13;
countries there is no strong anti-family planning movement and no real&#13;
opposition to family planning assistance per se. Sweden, with legalized&#13;
abortion, will provide assistance for abort:on as for family planning and&#13;
other health programs in developing countries if requestedo In Germany the&#13;
issue exists but is more muted0    Tn the Un:ited lingdom and Jagan there is&#13;
little opposition to family plannlng assistance, though the ,'.osue is more&#13;
delicate than many other aspects of development assistance0&#13;

"Anti-Imperialist" Reactions&#13;
2.42       This heading loosely ties together a somewhat different set of&#13;
concerns.&#13;
2.43      One concern is that third-world men and women will be coerced&#13;
into accepting contraceptives or, particularly, sterilization without their&#13;
truly informed consent. I/   This concern has been fed by incidents,&#13;
alleged or substantiated, of forced sterilization, particularly in India&#13;
and Bangladesh, and by the heavy pressure for smaller families from the&#13;
government of China.   Many other programs arouse the same concern, whether&#13;
or not appropriately, when family planning is aggressively promoted through&#13;
official channels or by powerful local chiefs and headmen.&#13;
2.44      A related concern is safety.    Particularly in the United States,&#13;
"feminist" groups and "consumer activists" attack some contraceptive pills&#13;
as unsafe because of known or suspected side-effects. They also decry what&#13;
they see as "second-class medicine" in the delivery of family planning&#13;
services by third-world family planning programs. Such programs may&#13;
distribute contraceptives without prescriptions; may distribute drugs such&#13;
as depoprovera, the long-acting injectable contraceptive, not yet approved&#13;
for contraceptive use in some developed countries; and may use paramedical&#13;
personnel less well trained than would be required in a developed country&#13;
to provide family planning services.&#13;
2.45      The concern with coercion and the concern with safety are some-&#13;
times associated with a belief or suspicion that developed country donors&#13;
like the United States, or at least those in such countries who advocate&#13;
lower Dirth rates, are motivated by racial fears or imperialist designs.&#13;
2.4b       This set of concerns has never been as powerful as the moral and&#13;
religious concerns in limiting population programs and assistance.&#13;
Moreover, tney may be fading as public and political acceptance of family&#13;
planning visibly spreads in the third world and with increased understand-&#13;
ing of the risKs of not contracepting when malnutrition is rife, sanitation&#13;
poor, and health care scarce. But they remain a factor and affect the&#13;
vigor of family planning programs and commitment to official policies&#13;
supportive of family planning.&#13;
Technical Reactions&#13;
2.47      Donor and channel organizations have also reckoned with critics,&#13;
mostly in academia, who deny that a "population problem" exists, or at&#13;
least that population growth is nearly so serious a threat as the more&#13;
apocalyptic advocates of the growth limits rationale contend.&#13;
2.48       These critics rebut assertions commonly made by advocates of&#13;
lower birth rates.   They deny (citing statistics) that the world's food&#13;
situation is worsening; that worsening famines are inevitable or even&#13;
likely; that arable land is being lost (on net) to desertification, erosion&#13;
31/ Hartman, Betsy and Jane Hughes, "Depopulating Bangladesh: and the Poor&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40 &#13;
or the like; that a larger population necessarlly means "more pressure" on&#13;
existing land; that the environment is deteriorating or in danger of doing&#13;
so; that oil and ores are being "used up"s that supplies of natural&#13;
resource are finite; or that higher population growth implies lover per&#13;
capita growth032/&#13;
2.49      These critics or others like them also takte to task the models by&#13;
which population growth has purportedly been shown to retard economlc&#13;
advance and "limits to growth" have purportedly been demonstrated0 Some&#13;
criticisms are directed at underlying assumptions. More have to do with&#13;
allegedly simplistic extrapolation of trends in exponential growtn models&#13;
that have "tne power to seduce and bewitch".33/ The critics assert that&#13;
such models them take inadequate account of market adjustments and&#13;
technical change. They also are more sanguine on how much economic growth&#13;
the growing populations will induce through larger markets and resulting&#13;
economies of scale, and also through groxing brainpower to create, adapt,&#13;
and diffuse technical change0&#13;
2.50      There are rejoinders to all these rebuttals, of course (also with&#13;
statistics)0 And surrejoinders. The debate in official circles has been&#13;
particularly intense recently in the United States034/ The debate has&#13;
generated demand for further research to clarify debate on a topic of such&#13;
surpassing importance0 In any case, the course of the scientific debate&#13;
will exercise great long-run influence on levels of population assistance0&#13;
2.51      In the meantime, the controversy does not strengthen the case for&#13;
population assistance0 And other types of development assistance--for&#13;
agriculture, industry, education, etc.--have their own advocates, their own&#13;
substantive and political rationales. Actual allocations to population&#13;
assistance naLurally reflect part of a complex balance among these&#13;
competing claims for aid funds that are particularly scarce at present0&#13;
C0 Supply vs0 Demand&#13;
2.52      A narrower debate, and one on which convergence seems more easily&#13;
acnieved, concerns whether birth rates are affected primarily by availa-&#13;
bility of effective family planning services and information ("supply") or&#13;
by social, economic, and cultural conditions that affect how many children&#13;
people want and how intensely they try to limit their childbearing&#13;
accordingly ("demand")0&#13;
2.53      The initial donor response to concern about populat'on growth was&#13;
obvious. bring to the men and women of the poorer countries the same birth&#13;
control methods and devices by which the men and women of the richer coun-&#13;
tries already effectively control their fertility0 "Supply" .hem with&#13;
family planning services and information. To this day family planning&#13;

services and information account for the bulk of population assistance.&#13;
Early enthusiasts were convinced that if effective services and information&#13;
were provided, men and especially women in the third world would welcome&#13;
them and use them effectively to substantially reduce their completed&#13;
fertility.35/&#13;
2.54      In some places that seemed to work.   But elsewhere family plan-&#13;
ning programs seemed to have little effect. "Supply" advocates were&#13;
convinced that where results were lackluster or worse, the problem must lie&#13;
in poor service delivery systems or methods. Others, however, though&#13;
accepting reduction of population growth as an end and, in most cases,&#13;
recognizing some value in family planning programs as means to that end,&#13;
suspected a different cause. Maybe where family planning services were&#13;
undersubscribed or otherwise ineffective, people really did not want&#13;
smaller families. Maybe the real key to reducing birth rates was improving&#13;
"demand" for family planning.36/&#13;
2.55      After all, they reasoned, even before modern contraceptive&#13;
methods were available, where conditions were right, where people had&#13;
wanted badly enough to control births, they had succeeded in doing so by&#13;
other measures. Should it not be true conversely that even if those&#13;
methods were made easily available, they would have little impact unless&#13;
enough people actually wanted to control the size of their families? Even&#13;
if family planning services would make a dent in birth rates, because&#13;
people did want fewer children than they were having, was it not obvious&#13;
that "zero population growth" could not be achieved in that way alone if,&#13;
as surveys showed, they still wanted more than the two children per family&#13;
(roughly) needed to "replace" the current generation?37/&#13;
2.56      It did indeed seem that third world peoples might have reasons&#13;
for not wanting smaller families. As USAID's population policy paper&#13;
noted, a poor and illiterate teenage bride in Bangladesh with a traditional&#13;
husband and still more traditional mother-in-law might want several sons as&#13;
soon as possible to secure her own position in the family. A peasant&#13;
couple in Asia might seek several children, sons especially, for reliable&#13;
labor on the farm, for physical protection, for support during an unpen-&#13;
sioned old age, and for fulfillment of religious duties. A mother in&#13;
Africa who has witnessed the deaths of many infants and children, her&#13;
neighbors' and her own, might want many children so that some survive.    The&#13;
unschooled wife of a farmer in Latin America might think family size is&#13;
a question of fate.38/&#13;

2.57      Underlying this, of course, are inherited biological urges and&#13;
instincts, maternal and paternal, formed in distant epochs and oerhaps&#13;
reinforced by traditional culture.&#13;
2.58      "Demand-side" advocates in donor, channel, and third world&#13;
institutions therefore argued that family planning programs alore would be&#13;
insufficient039/ They suspected that development itself might be "the&#13;
best pill". The near-replacement birth rates of nations in Europe and&#13;
elsewhere seemed to have followed or accompanied economic and social&#13;
development, not preceded it0 More hopefully, many believed development&#13;
strategies might be devised to encourage faster declines in desired family&#13;
size and more effective family planning by changing the economic and social&#13;
circumstances that affect attitudes toward childbearing and family size.&#13;
They urged research on "determinants of fertility" to identify those&#13;
conditions clearly.&#13;
2.59      The United States, United lingdom, UNFPA, and others have indeed&#13;
funded considerable research in response to those urgings.40/ Rhesults are&#13;
not entirely clear; human behaviour persists in obeying no neat rules.&#13;
Nonetheless, patterns emerge. Donors and channel organizations generally&#13;
believe poverty is associated with high fertility, though the links are&#13;
imprecise0    Death rates for children make a difference as expected;&#13;
higher infant and child mortality goes with higher fertility0 Presence or&#13;
absence of social "safety nets" seem to matter; where some provision for&#13;
old age other than a network of children is available, for example, fertil-&#13;
ity may go doin0m Education is also thought to have a powerful effect on&#13;
fertility; literate and relatively well-educated couples seems to have&#13;
fewer children than illiterate and ignorant ones0 Education for wiomen is&#13;
considered specially important, and employment options for women too; where&#13;
women have educational and economic opportunities, particularly outside the&#13;
home, fertility tends to fall0 Several of these "demand side'" forces tend&#13;
to interact synergestically.&#13;
2.60      Meanwhile, the supply-side advocates have also been v:'ndicated in&#13;
parto Donor and channel organizations generally believe the effectlveness&#13;
of family planning services depends significantly on the nature of service&#13;
delivery systems and methods. Experience with operations research, as will&#13;
appear in a later chapter, taught a great deal about what generally does&#13;
and does not work0   And greater sophistication in understanding the&#13;
determinants of fertility in particular countries, and in taking account of&#13;
cultural differences, has helped organizers to design family planning&#13;
programs tailored to local needs and sensitivitieso l/&#13;

2.61       The result seems to be increasing convergence of supply-demand&#13;
understanding. That understanding can be summarized by applying a fairly&#13;
simple model drawn from a U.S. population assistance policy paper that&#13;
conceives of completed family size as having three components:&#13;
(1)  Minimum Desired Family Size:    The number of children the&#13;
parents would want if they felt entirely free to choose,&#13;
without fear that any would die.&#13;
(2)  Insurance Births:   Additional children they would want to&#13;
ensure survival of the desired minimum.&#13;
(3)  Extra Births:   Additional children that they might not&#13;
have chosen to have, at least not consciously, but none-&#13;
theless do have, because they lack access to effective&#13;
birth control, know little or nothing of the birth&#13;
control option, follow cultural or religious tradition,&#13;
just do "what is natural" in the biological sense; or&#13;
resign themselves to a fate that in this respect as in&#13;
others they feel unable to control.42/&#13;
The tidy categories are, of course, artificial; parents do not think about&#13;
family size nearly so clearly, and the influences on their family size&#13;
decisions are not so neatly severable. But the model has a rough&#13;
correspondence with reality and helps sort through "supply side" and&#13;
"demand side" influences on fertility as perceived by donors and channel&#13;
organizations.&#13;
2.62       First, the supply side.   Family planning services and informa-&#13;
tion, made available through "population" programs and assistance or other-&#13;
wise, will plainly be most effective in eliminating unsought "extra"&#13;
births. Most obviously, they make available to people the means to avoid&#13;
such births and the information that such means exist and will work.&#13;
2.63       The major channel organizations, and several other donors gen-&#13;
erally believe there may be a cascading reaction here. Initial successful&#13;
use of birth control by a few of the desperate or the bold makes other&#13;
individuals, indeed the whole community, aware of the birth control&#13;
option. This may not only lead others who are equally desperate or bold,&#13;
or nearly so, to try it for themselves. It may also crack the overlay of&#13;
fatalism and tradition that leads the people to assume they have no control&#13;
over this aspect of their lives. It may lead them for the first time to&#13;
begin thinking of family size as a decision that is theirs to make.&#13;
Indeed, it may help crack the same overlay of fatalism and tradition in&#13;
related aspects of their lives, such as the roles and conditions of women,&#13;
which in turn may feed back again to family size determinations.&#13;

2.64      To the extent that child spacing and avoidance of higher order&#13;
and advanced age births improve child health, availability of family plan-&#13;
ning services and information may also help somewhat to reduce the need for&#13;
"insurance" births. Obviously, howiever, as demand-side advocates point&#13;
out, it can have no direct effect on minimum desired family sixe.&#13;
2.65      On the "demand side" are numerous possible "determinants of&#13;
fertility" to consider, USAID and UMFPA have led in explicatilng these,&#13;
though the United Kingdom and others have also supported resea7ch0&#13;
2.66      Child health (and to some extent maternal health) obvflously&#13;
impacts more directly than any other influence on the need for "insurance"&#13;
births. Health care, particularly maternal and child health czTe, can thus&#13;
affect fertility, as can improved food supply, cleaner water, End better&#13;
sanitationo (Sweden has especially emphasized the need for improved mater-&#13;
nal and child health care.)43/ Of course, all those things are even more&#13;
likely to reduce mortality and so increase population grow-yth, at least&#13;
modestly in the short run0   In the long run the impact of such measures on&#13;
"insurance" births could prove greater than their impact on mortalLty,&#13;
because people may in fact "overinsure".&#13;
2.67      The most precisely targeted "demand slde" determinents of fertil-&#13;
ity are thought to be improved educational and employment opportunities for&#13;
women0 Education and exposure to a wider world may increase women's&#13;
ability and determination to avoid unsought "extra" births0 It may also&#13;
help reduce infant and child mortality and so reduce the need N`or "insur-&#13;
ance" births0   Probably most important, however, is the impact on minimum&#13;
desired family size that seems fairly plain wdhere w^lomen have recently&#13;
joined the labor force--outside the home-in large numbers, raising the&#13;
opportunity cost of large families.&#13;
2068      Equally important are subtler impacts0   More educates, indepen-&#13;
dent, and "modern" women are far lees likely to be bound by fatalism and&#13;
tradition to consider the size of their families beyond their control0&#13;
They are more likely to learn of and to seek out family planning services&#13;
and information, which are still primarily sought by women rather than&#13;
men0 They may also be more assertive in mErriage and so may have a larger&#13;
voice in family size decisions0&#13;
2.69      Most of the negative impact of additional children, it seems&#13;
arguable, falls upon womeno They bear the discomforts and riEsLs of preg-&#13;
nancy and childbirth and do the work of child care0 Their maternal and&#13;
domestic burdens tie them to the hearth and confine them to a narrotwer&#13;
sphere. A larger voice for wives in decisions on additional children,&#13;
therefore, is thought likely to reduce family size, notwithstanding&#13;
"maternal instinct"0&#13;
2.70      The impacts of myriad other "demand side" influences can be&#13;
analyzed in similar ways, though none of them is thought to have the same&#13;
43/  Sweden, SIDA's Health Sector Policy Paper0   See also Sweden, Foreign&#13;
Ministry Communication, 19830&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
level of impact in most cultures as maternal and child health or&#13;
educational and employment opportunities for women.44/&#13;
2.71      General social and economic development will obviously influence&#13;
all three components of completed family size. It seems likely to reduce&#13;
"extra" births both by making access to family planning services and&#13;
information easier, if only because of greater wealth, and by breaking down&#13;
fatalism and tradition that makes fertility seem beyond control. It seems&#13;
likely to reduce "insurance" births as better maternal and child health&#13;
care, improved nutrition, safer water, and better sanitation reduce infant&#13;
and child mortality. And it may encourage lower minimum desired family&#13;
size--as it seems clearly to have done in already developed countries.&#13;
2.72      But the original idea was to enhance development by reducing&#13;
population growth, not vice versa. That catch may be mostly semantic,&#13;
however. Enhanced development and reduced population growth are thought to&#13;
be mutually reinforcing. Looking to development as a "demand side"&#13;
influence on population thus can make sense in a broader context. But the&#13;
problem is that faster declines in mortality of the third world recently,&#13;
as compared to slower declines earlier in Europe, lead to faster increases&#13;
in population growth. It seems far more difficult to raise living&#13;
standards for these rapidly growing populations.&#13;
2.73      Thus it may be necessary to find more selective mechanisms to&#13;
address population growth preferentially. If in a particular country such&#13;
as China, or Bangladesh, or Kenya it appears that further development may&#13;
be difficult without curbing population growth first, more selective mecha-&#13;
nisms may be considered imperative. If the growth-limits theories were&#13;
accepted, of course, finding such selective mechanisms might be regarded a&#13;
central concern for all mankind.&#13;
D. What Population Assistance Does&#13;
2.74      Population assistance is not much used for activities addressed&#13;
to the "demand side". This might be expected, perhaps, since it seems rea-&#13;
sonable that the relatively minor share of all development assistance allo-&#13;
cated to population programs should be addressed first to family planning&#13;
services and information--the "supply side". The insights on the "demand&#13;
side" might more reasonably be expected to be reflected in the use of&#13;
larger "pots" of development assistance moneys. But that, too, has&#13;
happened only to a limited extent. "Demand side" thinking helps support&#13;
quite small "women-in-development" programs, and some programs are&#13;
occasionally jointly funded with population assistance when they have both&#13;
family planning and feminist aspects. It is the feminist movement, though,&#13;
that really sustains the women-in-development programs, not the "demand&#13;
side" population considerations. "Demand side" concerns may have helped,&#13;
however, to encourage female education.&#13;
2.75      Population assistance funds often support family planning ser-&#13;
vices and information combined with other forms of primary maternal and&#13;
child health care. Population assistance could thus be regarded as having&#13;
44/ See e.g., U.S. Population Policy Paper and UNFPA Annual Reports.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46 -&#13;
a "demand side" aspect. At this stage of the demographic transition,&#13;
however, the "demand" aspect of maternal and child health care is regarded&#13;
as mitigating the effect on population growth of reduced mortality that&#13;
also results. Morever, family planning and maternal and child health&#13;
programs are generally combined primarily because "integration" is thought&#13;
to generate economies of scale and other administrative savings.&#13;
2.76      Population assistance thus principally supports efforts to&#13;
introduce and extend family planning services and information. it also&#13;
helps improve family planning methods, and to understand demographic trends&#13;
and what affects them.&#13;

CHAPTER III&#13;
THE SHAPE OF POPULATION PROGRAMS&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
3.01      Governments can thus address population issues through two main&#13;
kinds of efforts:&#13;
- family planning programs, often along with broader maternal&#13;
and child health care;&#13;
- development strategies and programs that naturally build&#13;
interest in smaller families, particularly by improving&#13;
opportunities for women.&#13;
3.02      To assist decision-making, national leaders need information on&#13;
the demographic situation, its consequences for development, and how family&#13;
planning and development may affect it. What governments actually do&#13;
varies with their interest, economic circumstances, cultural and social&#13;
heritage, and assessment of their country's social and political readiness&#13;
for family planning and development measures that may affect family size.&#13;
3.03      Population assistance itself concentrates on extending (1) family&#13;
planning services and information, often along with related maternal and&#13;
child health care (such activities can absorb substantial resources);&#13;
(2) research on family planning methods and ways of delivering services&#13;
(again often including maternal and child health care); and (3) efforts to&#13;
inform national leaders and program managers such as studies of the&#13;
demographic situation and its determinants and consequences. Population&#13;
assistance does not fund other development programs, e.g., public education&#13;
or rural development, that may also affect family size preferences. (Of&#13;
course it may fund sex education in schools or as part of rural development&#13;
or family planning services as part of rural development.)&#13;
3.04      Population assistance can help cover initial or recurring program&#13;
costs; it can help cover foreign exchange costs (either initial or&#13;
recurring) or local costs (which tend to recur). Although most assistance&#13;
donors prefer to cover initial foreign-exchange costs, in population&#13;
programs most costs are recurring (and much is local). Donors and channels&#13;
have proved generally willing to cover local recurring costs even for&#13;
extended periods. However, as will be discussed later, they show more&#13;
interest in shifting away from recurring costs as demand for assistance&#13;
rises. To ensure smooth operations of programs relying on population&#13;
assistance, maintaining reasonable consistency in policy signals, funding&#13;
levels, and funding mechanisms is critical.&#13;
A. Information for Policy Makers&#13;
3.05      The first question any government asks about population is, "Does&#13;
this country have a population problem and, if so, what is it?" Answers&#13;
require basic demographic information as a start. Particularly in least&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 --&#13;
developed countries, such information may be lltmted to begln -'-.1th and hard&#13;
to collect accurately.&#13;
3.06      Governments need information on populat:Â°.on scle, str-i.czure, and&#13;
distribution: birth rates, death rates, growth rates, and othea key demo-&#13;
graphic parameters. Such informatl1on is lyplcally obtained frcTn periodic&#13;
censuses and systems of vital registration, perhaps bolstered by specifIc&#13;
analyses. Over the past decade or so, the f4 .st ' thorough cers.uses have&#13;
been conducted in dozens of countries, recentl:y in many poor Arlican&#13;
countries. Elsewhere, second or third decennial censuses heve occurred0&#13;
Many vital re istration systems have alsO bteen established or consieerably&#13;
strengthened. /   A "World Fertility Fertil-ty Survey-' assess-'ing fertility,&#13;
family planning, and related social and economic conditions in some 70&#13;

population structure and growth that would occur if marriage patterns&#13;
changed or family planning practice increased. While such exercises are&#13;
necessarily simple and imprecise, they can assist policy makers in&#13;
preliminary analysis. USAID believes such exercises can show the&#13;
implications of population pressure persuasively, and its computerized&#13;
projection systems have aroused interest at senior levels of governments,&#13;
e.g. in Egypt.4/ The United Kingdom (ODA) and UNFPA have also supported&#13;
such efforts.&#13;
3.09      Developing country governments often also explore the implica-&#13;
tions of population growth for income growth and distribution, labor supply&#13;
and employment, the productive resource base, and overall development stra-&#13;
tegy. They may also explore broader implications for politics, society,&#13;
and the environment.5/ Such analysis of demographic consequences is still&#13;
in its infancy, and often controversial on theoretical, methodological, and&#13;
data-base grounds. A clearer picture must await further work country by&#13;
country and issue by issue. Population assistance has funded some of what&#13;
is available. Other work has been funded through scientific channels,&#13;
though relatively little thorough research is available on the third&#13;
world. To help replace speculation and ideology with something closer to&#13;
fact, some donors -- e.g., the Bank, USAID and Sweden (SIDA) -- are&#13;
considering increased funding for research on what population trends imply&#13;
for economic development, use of resources, and the environment in&#13;
individual countries and globally.6/&#13;
B. Family Planning Programs&#13;
3.10      Family planning services and information are the principal direct&#13;
means of reducing family size and slowing population growth in many&#13;
countries where substantial numbers of unwanted pregnancies occur. Family&#13;
planning is plainly not the whole story--even good services will not appeal&#13;
to many in extreme poverty and conservative cultures. (And delivering&#13;
"good services" is a plainly tougher job where poverty is severe.) But&#13;
where family planning services and information are woefully inadequate,&#13;
improving and extending them is an obvious step to take. Most population&#13;
assistance thus aims at extending family planning services--services that&#13;
are safe, effective, affordable, and grounded in the principle of free&#13;
choice.7/ Today family planning services are often provided in&#13;
conjunction with other basic maternal and child health care.&#13;

Early Family Planning Programs&#13;
3.11      Historically, as developing countries began "trying"' ami'ly&#13;
planning programs, first programs focused on contraception ir conjunction&#13;
with the most related health care, such as help wsith pregnancy and&#13;
childbirth. (This was true of some developed countries as weLl0)     Prcgrams&#13;
were usually run by private organizations, notably national fEmily planning&#13;
associations, often quite independently from government healt's programs"-"&#13;
partly because private organizations, usually small, wanted to focus on&#13;
"just this much" but also because of official hostility or tl'iidity toward&#13;
family planning or budgeting problems that underlay official reluctance to&#13;
provide it.  In countries at this early stage today, particularly in Afr-'ca&#13;
and Latin America, private organizations continue to pave the way. But&#13;
they collaborate increasingly wlth government health programs as family&#13;
planning has gained acceptability among health officials around the worl Go&#13;
Today governments often ask private organizations, notably t's family&#13;
planning associations, to "test thie waters" by providing the f`irst family&#13;
planning services perhaps using government facilities. Botswaza, Ethiopia,&#13;
Liberia, and Mali are cases in point. Such efforts typically involve heavy&#13;
assistance through IPPF, FPIA, Pathfinder, or universities o:- other&#13;
research organizations (often supported by USAID) that cooper7te w-Tith&#13;
indigenous institutions. The United Kingdom also assists such efforts0&#13;
3.12      Voluntarism and pursuit of acceptability, safety, effectiveness,&#13;
and affordability require consideration of three fundamentals: what family&#13;
planning methods will be offered, how these will be made avaÂ°lable, and hcw&#13;
informed consent will be assured.    Early stage programs typically focus on&#13;
gaining initial public and political acceptance and therefore concentrate&#13;
on voluntarism, safety, and cultural compatibility rather tban brcad impact&#13;
or cost-effectiveness. They are thus usually conservative on all three&#13;
fundamentals. First services are usually provided through urban clinics&#13;
where supervision of service providers is easier and closer touch can be&#13;
maintained with clients. Usually only a few methods--the least controver-&#13;
sial ones--are offered, such as IUDs, barrier methods (condoms, foams), and&#13;
perhaps pills on a restrictive basis. Care is taken to insure that clients&#13;
understand methods0   Advertising or "informational" efforts are limIted;&#13;
clinics offer services to those w^ho come and ask and are thus quite&#13;
passive0 Examples include most programs of national family 1;lanning&#13;
associations in Africa, supported heavily by IPPF, Pathfinder's efforts _r&#13;
Nigeria and Egypt, and FPIA9s in Lesotho. The United Kingdom (ODA)&#13;
supports such efforts at times, eog0, in Bangladesh, and Kenya0&#13;
3.13      Gradually more family planning clinics may be bu'il' to cover&#13;
larger geographic areas, their staffs may be strengthened with nurses or&#13;
other non-physician personnel as well as physicians, and the range of&#13;
methods offered may be expanded, with more liberal access to _llUs or&#13;
sterilization0 Specialized services for back-up may be arrarged through&#13;
existing hospitals or clinics0   This effort can consume conslderable time&#13;
and resourceso   It still relies heavily on assistance, primar'ly through&#13;
private channels since programs remain generally private, though USAID may&#13;
provide some bilateral assistance0 (In Bangladesh, although USAID provides&#13;
substantial assistance to the government, it has looked for opportunities&#13;
to help private organizations on the grounds that they operate effectively&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
in that difficult setting, although on a limited scale.8/) While most&#13;
people remain beyond convenient reach of the clinics and family planning&#13;
practice may be limited, stories will be told of clients who travel for&#13;
days to reach clinics. And where abortion was common, physicians and&#13;
nurses may report fewer women suffering from botched abortion.&#13;
Family Planning Outreach&#13;
3.14      As clinic-based programs become more widely accepted, family&#13;
planning activists--in donor governments, channel organizations, and the&#13;
developing countries--usually press to bring services closer to more people&#13;
to reduce the financial, physical, and psychological cost of obtaining&#13;
services. At first, clinics may simply hire "health educators" to go out&#13;
into the community and discuss family planning. But soon demand arises for&#13;
more sources of service and information within the community itself. This&#13;
leads to the next major stage of service programs: "outreach" down and out&#13;
into the community, the ultimate form of which is "community based distri-&#13;
bution " sometimes including commercial dist,ribution of contraceptives.&#13;
Over the past several years donors and channel organizations have become&#13;
convinced of the merits of the outreach approach; USAID, IPPF, FPIA, and&#13;
Pathfinder now give it top priority, with IPPF leading the way several&#13;
years ago. UNFPA also welcomes opportunities to assist outreach programs.&#13;
3.15      The key to outreach is provision of service through a hierar-&#13;
chical structure rooted in communities. Family planning information and&#13;
contraceptives are offered by networks of paramedical "outreach workers"&#13;
drawn from the communities they serve. These outreach workers are selected&#13;
from trusted members of the community, often women; they are given brief&#13;
training (weeks at most). They work on a volunteer basis or for very&#13;
little compensation, their rewards being largely personal and subjective.&#13;
Their enthusiasm and dedication are often obvious immediately to the&#13;
visitor from abroad. Local "community educators", again community leaders&#13;
such as teachers or priests, may work alongside the outreach workers. The&#13;
outreach workers and "educators" are supervised and directed by relatively&#13;
few professionals, typically including health workers such as nurses from&#13;
the clinics or mid-level managers. These people are in turn supervised by&#13;
a few physicians and senior managers. Early examples include family plan-&#13;
ning associations of Brazil and Colombia (assisted by IPPF, :athfinder, and&#13;
FPIA); later examples include FPIA-assisted projects in Bangladesh, Kenya&#13;
and Nigeria, India's family planning association, and Pathfinder-assisted&#13;
projects in Bangladesh.&#13;
3.16      Several donors and most channels have become convinced that&#13;
outreach systems can promote acceptance since workers are known to and&#13;
trusted by their clients and systems can be designed to reflect community&#13;
culture. For example, women outreach workers who visit households and pro-&#13;
tect client privacy are welcomed in Bangladesh where women live under high-&#13;
ly restrictive customs that inhibit travel and where women's reluctance to&#13;

52 -&#13;
seek health care from men is extreme09/ But outreach organized as a&#13;
community-wide effort with community-wide objectives works well in&#13;
Indonesia where concern for privacy is often weaker, women have more&#13;
independence generally, and communities are accustomed to `mutual self&#13;
help".&#13;
3.17      Using outreach workers is also thought to reduce coots per capitE&#13;
population far below what clinics to achieve similar coverage would have&#13;
required, primarily because outreach workers' wJages are low (or zero),&#13;
fewer clinics will have to be built, and fewer higher level health care&#13;
providers, particularly physicians, hired. Moreover, the involvement of&#13;
communities in service delivery may lead to offers of land for clinics or&#13;
distribution points or of support for the clinics and distribution points&#13;
(even in poor communities)olU/   Precise costs are difficult to specify&#13;
because of the variety in approaches to outreach thorny concept.ual issues&#13;
on what affects health and fertility, and enormous practical problems&#13;
collecting datao But operations research funded by several donors has&#13;
been providing strong evidence that it is comparatively cost-effective.11/&#13;
3.18      The potential weakness of such outreach is safety, because of the&#13;
more distant involvement of the "health professional"0 Yet experience&#13;
suggests outreach workers do generally operate effectively and offer the&#13;
advantage of greater rapport with clients though training and supervision&#13;
affect performance considerably. Exactly wyhat services outreach workers&#13;
are allowed to provide and how vary by country and area, and donors and&#13;
channels tend to review requests for assistance case-by-case and carefullyo&#13;
3.19      Two broad patterns of service delivery have emerged0    Sometimes&#13;
outreach workers work from local "distribution posts", such as their homes&#13;
or shops, organizing group meetings of women, men, or sometimes botho02/&#13;
Sometimes they canvass households systematically, as in Indonesia, to&#13;
discuss family planning and, since they are typically talking to young&#13;
mothers, perhaps related maternal and child health issues0&#13;
3020      Usually outreach workers can provide not only condoms and other&#13;
barrier methods but even pills, after simple screening of potential pill&#13;
users, and pills are likely to be the most popular methodo    Sometimes out-&#13;
reach workers do screening; other times they refer potential pAll users to&#13;
clinics for screening and initial supplies of pills but then Tesupply them&#13;
from distribution posts or at home0 They also refer people w-yho want IUDs&#13;

or perhaps sterilization to clinics. In Bangladesh some outreach workers&#13;
accompany women to the clinics for sterilization, help them get home, and&#13;
visit them for a week or so to check for any problems.13/ Even when&#13;
outreach workers concentrate on family planning, they often discuss broader&#13;
maternal and child health needs with mothers since child spacing decisions&#13;
are part of this broader picture. They also refer mothers and children&#13;
with other health needs, such as treatment for severe malnutrition or&#13;
immunization, to government clinics or whatever other health care is&#13;
available. Thus such outreach programs are hardly ever "pure" family&#13;
planning. By bringing at least some care to women who would otherwise get&#13;
little or none, such programs can improve the health and safety of mothers&#13;
and children. Concern exists among donors and channels that workers'&#13;
training be strengthened so that they can provide quality care and&#13;
understand better when to refer clients.&#13;
3.21      Such outreach programs also typically begin on a small scale,&#13;
assisted largely by private organizations, either national family planning&#13;
associations or more localized family planning groups such as the "Con-&#13;
cerned Women for Family Planning" in Dacca and Chittagong.14/ The main&#13;
channels for such assistance have been IPPF, FPIA, and Pathfinder, though&#13;
other private organizations such as Save the Children, the YWCA or churches&#13;
have also assisted some efforts.   (The United Kingdom, United States, and&#13;
Sweden sometimes provide modest support to such private groups above and&#13;
beyond their substantial contributions to the major channels.)    Sometimes&#13;
such programs expand to a larger scale, as in Pathfinder's community based&#13;
distribution projects covering about one million people in Bangladesh.15/&#13;
Occasionally they reach a massive scale, as in Colombia and Brazil, where&#13;
national family planning associations provide extensive services with&#13;
assistance from IPPF, Pathfinder, and FPIA. Sometimes commercial&#13;
distribution of contraceptives reinforces outreach substantially; when&#13;
assisted by governments or population assistance, such commercial&#13;
distribution becomes "social marketing". Often governments observe or&#13;
assist such programs to test the political climate for community-based&#13;
family planning programs. Again Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico are cases in&#13;
point. Other governments focus more on whether outreach encourages family&#13;
planning practice at an affordable cost. Here Pathfinder's Bangladesh&#13;
efforts are cases in point. The private "channel organizations" support&#13;
such outreach in good part in the hope that governments will see their&#13;
impact, take them over and expand them. Indeed in Indonesia and Thailand,&#13;
governments provide family planning outreach on a massive scale, with&#13;
impressive results, as discussed below.&#13;
Primary Health Care&#13;
3.22      As family planning becomes established via outreach, it has&#13;
tended to encourage and blend with broader efforts to improve maternal and&#13;

child health. Health planners in donor, channel, or developing country&#13;
institutions believe related problems should be dealt with jointlyo Birth&#13;
spacing being tied to maternal and child health, they begin including more&#13;
family planning in their maternal and child health programs and vice&#13;
versa. Family planning workers realize that improvements in maternal and&#13;
child health are needed and may encourage family planning, so they seek&#13;
additional referral facilities and press governments to let them use what-&#13;
ever government health clinics may exist. Government clinics often become&#13;
the backup for family planning as it is extended, and the outreach--even if&#13;
it initially focuses on family planning--tends to broaden to cover basic&#13;
and related maternal and child health issues.16/    It is thought or hoped&#13;
that combining family planning with maternal and child health services may&#13;
encourage family planning practice. But experience has raised concern that&#13;
family planning may suffer as systems broaden--as outreach workers and&#13;
clinics take on additional responsibilities in health care.17/ Debate&#13;
thus persists on appropriate balance between famiy planning and other&#13;
health services.&#13;
3.23      Broader health care is, of course, much desired but had long&#13;
seemed unaffordable and impractical. Early trials of family planning and&#13;
maternal and child health outreach brought hope that this new approach--&#13;
community-based outreach--could be used to extend broader PHCO It was&#13;
hoped that hierarchical networks of community-based outreach workers backed&#13;
by lean clinical infrastructure could bring enough health care--as well as&#13;
family planning--to help break the vicious circle of malnutrition, infec-&#13;
tion, and high fertility, and to deal with broader health problems such as&#13;
parasite control and immunization0.8/ The hierarchical patterns actually&#13;
being tried vary. But some technologies that can deal quite effectively&#13;
with most major threats to health in developing countries are quite well&#13;
understood and relatively easy for outreach workers to provide0 These&#13;
include not only such family plannlng services as pills, condoms, and other&#13;
barrier methods, but oral rehydration salts for combatting dlarrheal&#13;
infections (where the principal danger is loss of fluids), chloroquine&#13;
tablets for malaria0 anthelmintic medicines for some parasites, soap, and&#13;
advice on breastfeeding, weaning, and handwashing (still perhaps the&#13;
principal means of preventing the spread of infection)019/ Immunization&#13;
is also important but harder to deliver when it requires a "cold chain" to&#13;
preserve the chemicals0&#13;

3.24      What outreach workers actually provide varies enormously.    In&#13;
several programs, e.g., in Indonesia, outreach workers are beginning to&#13;
provide not only contraceptives and advice on family planning but also&#13;
advice on nutrition and nutritional supplements and some basic medicines.&#13;
In several countries, e.g., Egypt, outreach workers are beginning to&#13;
provide oral rehydration salts along with contraceptives. In El Salvador&#13;
at least until recently, outreach workers were beginning to travel around&#13;
the country on bicycles with contraceptives, malaria and other anti-&#13;
parasite medications, mung bean seeds and a posthole digger--to provide&#13;
contraceptives and medicines to rural households, dig latrines, and&#13;
encourage planting beans for protein and vitamin A.&#13;
3.25      Donors, including the United States, the Nordic countries, the&#13;
United Kingdom, and UNFPA have pressed particularly for such PHC including&#13;
family planning; some have emphasized that family planning should not "get&#13;
lost" as PHC is broadened. (Sweden has particularly urged that family&#13;
planning services be "balanced" by other maternal and child health&#13;
care.20/) WHO and UNICEF have, of course, also pressed to extend PHC,&#13;
though with less specific focus on family planning. Many donors believe&#13;
that where food supplies are reasonable and at least some clean water&#13;
within reach, such PHC can improve health markedly. Even in difficult&#13;
circumstances, improvements may be substantial. Moreover, such PHC can be&#13;
quite practical. Costs are difficult to estimate precisely but programs&#13;
with substantial impact can be kept within $5-20 per capita per year.&#13;
Overall financing is a problem, particularly as many costs tend to recur&#13;
annually (for medicines, contraceptives, and salaries). Management&#13;
of personnel and materials for extensive programs is another common&#13;
problem, eased as communities contribute resources, organizational talent,&#13;
and people to help provide the services.21/&#13;
3.26      Population assistance contributed to the evolution of such pri-&#13;
mary health care programs. It helped finance the pioneering family plan-&#13;
ning outreach programs run by the private family planning associations in&#13;
Brazil and Colombia, by private organizations in Thailand, and by a few&#13;
government programs, notably in Indonesia, that demonstrated how outreach&#13;
worked when focused on family planning. In Africa smaller PHC outreach&#13;
efforts funded largely by the channel organizations--e.g., FPIA's activi-&#13;
ties in Kenya and the Sudan, Pathfinder's in Nigeria--are demonstrating the&#13;
efficacy of the approach there. The Japanese Organization for Interna-&#13;
tional Cooperation in Family Planning is initiating family planning, nutri-&#13;
tional, and parasite control efforts in several countries in Asia and Latin&#13;
America, often cooperating with IPPF. Other donors, e.g., the United&#13;
Kingdom and United States, have funded similar efforts in India and&#13;
Bangladesh. More rigorous experimentation through "operations research",&#13;
funded particularly by USAID, has helped determine what services could be&#13;
provided safely, effectively, and affordably through outreach networks.22/&#13;

These efforts were complemented by programs sponsored by WHO, UNTICEF, the&#13;
World Bank, and others focused more on health. All these organizations&#13;
have worked to make the potential of PHC knowm among policy makers as well&#13;
as researchers.&#13;
3.27      Such efforts have generated broad interest in extending primary&#13;
health care throughout the third world0   Thus in 1978 most nations joined&#13;
at a United Nations Conference in Alma Ata in a commitment in principle to&#13;
work toward "health for all" by the year 2000. The crit-Ical neans to this&#13;
end in developing countries was to be primary health care, wi2Ji maternal&#13;
and child health and family planning at its core0 Actual effoets have, of&#13;
course, been constrained by competing priorities and resource limitations,&#13;
but some progress is apparent.&#13;
3.28      Most governments of the third world are now committed to extend-&#13;
ing primary health care, and many have embarked on major efforts to do soo&#13;
Most countries of Latin America are expanding government health services,&#13;
many including family planning components (which vary in strength)o&#13;
Colombia, Mexico, Peru, El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Panama are cases in&#13;
point. (Even in Brazil, where the federal government still does not&#13;
support family planning overtly, several state governments cooperate with&#13;
the national family planning association to extend family plaaning using&#13;
government health facilities as backup0) In Asia, almost all governments&#13;
are extending primary health care and family planning, though accomplish-&#13;
ments vary0 In Africa, most governments have established blueprints for&#13;
primary health care, and early efforts to implement programs azre underway,&#13;
though family planning (usually emphasizing child spacing to improve&#13;
maternal and child health) is still at a very early stage in nost&#13;
areas0&#13;
3.29      Official Development Assistance for health is contributing&#13;
massively to these major governmental PHC programso But ODA for population&#13;
also provides support (sometimes focusing more on family plann:;ng and&#13;
related maternal and child health)0 UNFPA is a major source of support;&#13;
UNICEF and WHO also contribute (sometimes using UNFPA resources)0 The&#13;
World Bank has organized multi-donor groups (sometimes informal) to help&#13;
fund primary health care including family planning in several countries of&#13;
Asia and in Egypt and Kenyao   Other donors--Swyeden, Norway, the United&#13;
Kingdom, Japan, Germany, and the United States--often participate in&#13;
Bank-led efforts by contributing population or sometimes health&#13;
assistance0 Sometimes UNFPA joins informally0 Coordinating ouch&#13;
multi-donor efforts has concerned some recipient countries, si7nce&#13;
management requirements are substantial and capacity may be limited0&#13;
Maintaining clear "policy signals" from various donors is critical from the&#13;
developing country perspectiveo Donors also like to avoid ccnplicating&#13;
overlaps among their various efforts0 Thus ofzen a particular donor offers&#13;
to finance a particular part of the Bank's broader effort0 COften the World&#13;
Bank funds the construction of clinics or other infrastructure and,&#13;
especially recently, more service-related components0 USAID and S-.eden&#13;
tend to help provide contraceptives, and USAID supports the outreach layer&#13;
heavily0 UNFPA will cover a broad range of requirements0 Bvz.f India&#13;
"coordinates" its donors by asking each to wfork in a different area0   The&#13;
Bank assists in Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh, UNFPA in Bihar and&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

United Kingdom in Orissa. (Of course each of these states is larger in&#13;
population and area than many developing countries). But Norway prefers to&#13;
concentrate on one aspect throughout India--an All-India Post-Partum,&#13;
Program. As PHC expands and requests for assistance grow, donors are&#13;
becoming more concerned about perpetuating assistance, more interested in&#13;
reducing support for local recurring costs, and more encouraging of&#13;
experiments in charging for services to improve local cost recovery. But&#13;
they remain willing, on the whole, to finance local recurring costs.&#13;
Donors also remain concerned about the focus of PHC programs--about&#13;
preserving sufficient attention to family planning and the most critical&#13;
and cost-effective maternal and chid health measures.&#13;
3.30      As family planning is integrated with primary health care,&#13;
efforts often begin to integrate it with other development programs or&#13;
community organizations, to show how family planning can affect what they&#13;
are trying to accomplish. Such efforts often involve women's groups or&#13;
youth groups, occasionally men's groups, church groups, unions, agricul-&#13;
tural extension workers or the like. They are still tried on a relatively&#13;
modest scale, often with funding from the private organizations, notably&#13;
IPPF, FPIA, and Pathfinder, though UNFPA, USAID, and the United Kingdom&#13;
(ODA) among others, have supported them sometimes.&#13;
3.31       Increased efforts are also often undertaken to distribute&#13;
contraceptives commercially via subsidized programs called "social&#13;
marketing" and/or via regular commercial channels including physicians and&#13;
pharmacies. Such programs can utilize existing distribution networks,&#13;
helpful in difficult conditions (e.g., Bangladesh and India). They are&#13;
also widespread in Latin America. Their potential weakness lies in&#13;
provision of medicines with relatively little supervision. Nonetheless,&#13;
such activities are increasingly common and are often organized to&#13;
reinforce government outreach programs providing maternal and child health&#13;
care. Among donors USAID was first to finance trials of commercial&#13;
distribution; UNFPA, among others, also assists now.&#13;
3.32      As a wider variety of family planning methods is offered through&#13;
a wider variety of channels, concern for safety and informed consent may&#13;
increase among donor and channel organizations, as in the third world.&#13;
Typically efforts are made to improve outreach workers' understanding of&#13;
each method, to encourage early identification of any side effects and&#13;
rapid referral to clinics for advice, and to help women change methods if&#13;
side-effects persist--in short, to promote a "user's perspective."23/&#13;
Such a perspective can also serve the objectives of managers and sponsors&#13;
by encouraging women to remain in family planning programs, though it can&#13;
raise program costs and administrative requirements. In many countries,&#13;
especially in Latin America where contraceptives are often sold through&#13;
drug stores, major programs are underway to train pharmacists and other&#13;
drug store employees in family planning. UNFPA, USAID, Pathfinder and&#13;
other private organizations have all helped develop such educational&#13;
efforts.&#13;

3.33      Special concern has focused on safety and informed consent in&#13;
sterilization programs. Sterilization has proved quite popular in many&#13;
countries. (For example, in Brazil sterilization is not legal as a family&#13;
planning method; yet in some states almost one-fifth of fertile-age women&#13;
have sought sterilization in conjunction with caesarian sections, many&#13;
otherwise unnecessary.) To make the procedure as safe as possible, efforts&#13;
are underway to encourage "minilaparotomy" under local anasthesia, and to&#13;
improve training, set standards and practical guidelines for aseptic tech-&#13;
nique, and investigate any problems. AVS and USAID have been primary&#13;
sources of support for sterilization programs, particularly in Asia, which&#13;
have also gotten support from UNFPA and private channels024/ ::ntensive&#13;
efforts have been made particularly by AVS, other private channels, UNFPA&#13;
and USAID to improve medical technique. Efforts involving donors (espe-&#13;
cially USAID, British ODA and Swedish SIDA), the United Mations, and others&#13;
are also underway to help ensure informed consent (particulariy among&#13;
poorly educated women) by insisting that procedures be explained thorough-&#13;
ly, encouraging formal consent procedures, providing services only to w^omen&#13;
of a certain age with several living children, and so on.&#13;
3.34      In conjunction with family planning services, most countries&#13;
undertake special advertising or "information, education, and communica-&#13;
tion" programs to spread the word on the benefits and availabil.4ty of&#13;
family planning services and on what to do in case of side effects0 Multi-&#13;
media efforts, ranging from radio and television "spots" to traditional&#13;
theatre, are often undertaken, again with substantial help from population&#13;
assistance0 UNFPA has perhaps led in this area, though USAID, the Nordic&#13;
countries, and the United Kingdom (ODA) have funded some efforts, and the&#13;
indigenous family planning organizations supported by IPPF do extensive&#13;
work0&#13;
3.35      More countries are also e4perimenting with incentives for&#13;
acceptors to encourage family planning. Increasingly program planners are&#13;
-onvinced that an economic case for such incentives existso    individual&#13;
couples may have micro-level reasons for wanting many children--for them&#13;
"optimizing" family size may lead late to family planning. lncentives can&#13;
help them share society's expected gain--help prlvatize the public good&#13;
that their decision to limit births is thought to produce0 The risk, of&#13;
course, is that the incentives may be coercive or at least lead to undue&#13;
influence and decisions that are regretted later. Incentives can be given&#13;
in cash or in kind; for individuals or communities; short term or long&#13;
term; based on consumer preferences or "development needs," and linked to&#13;
particular methods of family planning or just overall family planning&#13;
practice or birth rate reductions. A few developing countries, notably&#13;
China and Singapore, have tried a variety of economic incentives, and more&#13;
are considering various mild forms. While most donors shy away from any&#13;
incentives, they are most likely to support community incentives for longer&#13;
term development aims, since these are most likely to reflect the economic&#13;
case for incentives and less likely to involve their liabilities. WThile&#13;
some developing countries have provided transistor radios or cther consumer&#13;
goods as added inducements for family planning, most donors have been&#13;

concerned that this could lead to regretted decisions, undue short-term&#13;
influence and similarly, donors have shied away from cash incentives, which&#13;
can too easily be taken from young women and given over to husbands or&#13;
mothers-in-law who may or may not have the younger women's best interests&#13;
at heart. UNFPA has supported some community incentives--e.g. a program&#13;
covering 14 million people in Egypt where communities are given&#13;
interest-free loans to use for whatever development purpose they choose if&#13;
family planning practice meets certain levels.   Indonesia's family planning&#13;
program includes "savings lotteries" where everyone can win eventually but&#13;
the chance of an early win may have some incentive effect.    Private&#13;
organizations also generally shy away from incentives.    But one, Thailand's&#13;
Population and Community Development Association, is famous for its&#13;
creative use of incentives (e.g. free loans of water buffaloes for help&#13;
with plowing in conjunction with family planning practice).&#13;
3.36      Particular concern has focused on incentives for sterilization&#13;
since it is a permanent method. Thus USAID will not provide any incentive&#13;
for sterilization "over other methods" though it recognizes that providing&#13;
a clean sari to a woman who has only one dirty one will help prevent post-&#13;
operative infection and covering transport costs will enable her to ride,&#13;
rather than walk, home and so reduce the risk of other complications.25/&#13;
It will also reimburse for some work foregone. Sweden opposes incentives&#13;
for clients or service providers that favor sterilization over another&#13;
method.26/ In short, measures that obviously promote safety or put&#13;
sterilization on a par with other methods are not "incentives," though the&#13;
line may be difficult to draw. Actually several nations, e.g., Bangladesh&#13;
and Sri Lanka, have instituted or are considering various incentives in&#13;
conjunction with sterilization and requested population assistance for such&#13;
purposes. Thus on this issue, donors and channels tend to be more&#13;
conservative than some developing countries.&#13;
3.37      Donors have also expressed concern that systems of remuneration&#13;
for service-providers not encourage sacrifice of quality of service for&#13;
quantity (as noted above). Fees for each sterilization procedure or any&#13;
quantitative "targets" for family planning service providers have caused&#13;
particular concern, although fee-for-service is common practice among&#13;
private-sector physicians.&#13;
3.38      Interest persists in exploring the use of "pension programs" or&#13;
other ways to provide old-age security for family planning clients, since&#13;
children and especially sons are often the only practical source of old-age&#13;
support today for poor women in conservative cultures. Why not provide&#13;
some alternative for people willing to limit family size and so blunt the&#13;
need for sons? Cost and management concerns have prevented much experimen-&#13;
tation along these lines. One experiment, tried in India's tea estates,&#13;
did yield intriguing results. The estates were convinced incentives in the&#13;
form of "old-age savings accounts" would pay for themselves by obviating&#13;
the need for some maternal and child health care, housing, etc. Incentives&#13;

were indeed associated with lower birth rates; yet women seemed oddly&#13;
confused about what the incentive was or whether they even had ito27/    A&#13;
clearer picture must await further trials.&#13;
C. Research on Family Planning Methods and Service Delivery&#13;
and Fertility Determinants&#13;
3.39      Donor nations, channel organizations, and recipient nations share&#13;
a strong interest in improving family planning methods and del-very sys-&#13;
tems. Research has been a major focus particularly of the UnIted States,&#13;
the Nordic Countries the United Kingdom, the Population Council, IPPF, and&#13;
increasingly UNFPAo26/   Often working through private organizations, USAID&#13;
has concentrated on applied research--developing new technologles (e.g.,&#13;
tubal rings and clips for use in laparascopic sterilization and cervical&#13;
sponges) and adapting others to developing-country conditions. It has&#13;
modified laparoscopy and "minilaparotomy" techniques (in cooperation with&#13;
Thai physicians particularly) and achieved safer sterilization under local&#13;
anesthesia on an out-patient basis. It has worked to improve .^nuse safety&#13;
of pills (by lowering hormone dosage) and IUDs (particularly t-ne Copper-&#13;
T)0  In so doing, it has also helped determine what methods no2 to use --&#13;
e.g., culdoscopic sterilization, over 20 different IUDs, and certain&#13;
techniques for vasectomy. Other U.S. government and private research has&#13;
substantially improved family planning methods029/&#13;
3.40      Similarly, Sweden and the United lKingdom have supportzed major&#13;
research on family planning methodso British studies of the safety of the&#13;
pill in third world circumstances remain classic0    Swedish scIentists have&#13;
contributed in several fields0&#13;
3.41      Among the channel organizations, UMFPA has supported some biomed-&#13;
ical research; the Population Council and IPPF have supported substantial&#13;
research, and IPPF has helped establish international standards for safety&#13;
and use of particular methodso In 1972 WHO embarked on a major research&#13;
program--the Special Programme for Research in Human Reproduction-which&#13;
has attracted major support from the United States, Sweden, ane several&#13;
other countries bilaterally, as well as UNFPA and other U.N.&#13;
organizations0&#13;
3.42      Operations research and program evaluations of alternative ways&#13;
of delivering family planning have been critical in testing outreach&#13;
systems for family planning and related maternal and child health0 Here&#13;

USAID has led, working through universities and other private organizations&#13;
in some 24 countries. USAID's operations research projects in diverse&#13;
cultural settings show that non-clinical distribution of family planning&#13;
and health interventions is feasible, acceptable, and cost-effective.30/&#13;
On the whole, contraceptive prevalence rates in project areas have doubled&#13;
after a year or two. These results have led to major policy changes and&#13;
improvements in service delivery in all three major continents of the third&#13;
world. For example, the Government of Colombia changed its policy to allow&#13;
primary health care' workers to provide contraceptives in the home; in&#13;
Brazil, operations research tested alternative service delivery schemes&#13;
which significantly improved the cost-effectiveness of the BEMFAM family&#13;
planning program; in Bangladesh, operations research has offered guidance&#13;
not only for family planning outreach but for material and child&#13;
health. Research in other countries such as Haiti, Egypt, Morocco and&#13;
Tunisia demonstrated the acceptability and effectiveness of household&#13;
distribution of contraceptives--leading to major policy shifts and expanded&#13;
contraceptive distribution programs. In several African countries&#13;
(Nigeria, Sudan, Tanzania and Zaire) operations research projects are&#13;
helping launch family planning and maternal and child health services,&#13;
some 13 projects in nine countries have been replicated or expanded, and&#13;
programs are planned.&#13;
3.43       While family planning accounts for the bulk of population&#13;
assistance, its share has fallen recently. As overall population&#13;
assistance fell in real terms, assistance for family planning fell faster.&#13;
The same pattern holds for all regions except EMENA.&#13;
D. Regional Overviews&#13;
1. ASIA&#13;
3.44      Asia's population of some 2.7 billion is now growing at under two&#13;
percent annually and family size (TFR) averages just over four children.&#13;
But this average masks broad variations in the economic, cultural, politi-&#13;
cal, and demographic situations of particular countries.31/ China's&#13;
population of about one billion is apparently growing at around 1.2%&#13;
annually, with an implied average family size (TFR) of about 2.3 despite&#13;
vigorous efforts to promote a one-child family. In Bangladesh, where&#13;
poverty is extreme, the population is growing at about 3.0% and average&#13;
family size exceeds six children. In India, where GNP per capita is about&#13;
$260, life expectancy is just over 55 years, and only one-fifth of women&#13;
can read, the population of over 690 million is now growing at about&#13;
2%. In Indonesia, with GNP per capita of $580 and an outstanding family&#13;

planning program, the population of over 145 mlllion is groe^ing at about 2%&#13;
and family size averages about four children. And in Singapore and Hong&#13;
Kong, population growth has slowed to around 1% and family size averages&#13;
about two children. On balance9 countries where development has progressed&#13;
and where family planning services are available have relatively slowly&#13;
growing populations. In the poorer countries, population groweth varies0&#13;
How much that depends on "development" or "family planning" (and how much&#13;
the ability to organize family planning programs depends on "stage of&#13;
development") is difficult to say0&#13;
3.45      All large Asian countries are deeply committed to family planning&#13;
to bring population growth into better balance with resources, facilitate&#13;
improvement in individual living standards, and improve maternal and child&#13;
health0 Most large government programs have received major population&#13;
assistance for at least a decade, primarily to strengthen family planning&#13;
the World Bank, UNFPA, USAID, the United Kingdom, Nordic countries, West&#13;
Germany, and Japan.&#13;
3.46      In Bangladesh and Pakistan, ambitious family planning&#13;
programshave been tried for years--and been plagued by frustrating setbacks&#13;
as official enthusiasm and policy commitment run afoul of entrenched&#13;
cultural traditions, difficult terrain, and limited management capacity,&#13;
exacerbated in the Bangladesh case by shifts in organization back and forth&#13;
between family planning only and broader PHC programs0   In the Philippines,&#13;
complex relations with the Catholic Church and institutional problems have&#13;
caused the family planning program to fluctuate0 In India, leaders'&#13;
zealousness combined with management and logistics problems are thought to&#13;
have inhibited acceptance of family planning, though a massive effort to&#13;
extend government-sponsored PHC outreach and provide voluntary family&#13;
planning services through government programs is now underwfay0&#13;
3.47      Asian governments usually request major assistance from the World&#13;
Bank, UNFPA, USAID, the Nordic countries and other donors to extend&#13;
government programs over broad areas0 But they often also lock to the&#13;
private organizations for large "pilots" or other innovative efforts0&#13;
Often they also ask private organizations to cover particular fields or&#13;
areas, especially urban outreach or perhaps youth "trial" programs0 They&#13;
also usually involve national family planning associations in building&#13;
public support through information and may ask them to help pioneer some&#13;
service delivery0 And several, e0go, India, Bangladesh, and 'hailand,&#13;
encourage commercial distribution of contraceptiveso They also seek&#13;
substantial operations and other researth0 Total assistance to Asian&#13;
countries is often massive, covering all areas but with principal and&#13;
increasing focus on services0 Often a major problem is coordf-nating donor&#13;
efforts. Another is ensuring that the results of innovative private&#13;
programs and operations research feed quickly into the broader programs0&#13;
3o48      In Indonesia and Thailand, which are not wealthy countries,&#13;
government commitment, conducive social circumstances, and stronger manage-&#13;
ment capacity combine to make a broad range of family planning services and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
information readily available.32/ This has happened through vigorous&#13;
community-based outreach programs. The programs provide pills as the most&#13;
popular method, along with condoms and barrier methods. They also often&#13;
provide advice or help with basic maternal and child health problems. (In&#13;
Thailand it has included more extensive maternal and child health care.)&#13;
The outreach networks link naturally to the emerging PHC infrastructure:&#13;
women are referred to village health posts or more distant clinics for&#13;
IUDs, sterilization, or help with maternal and child health problems. The&#13;
Thai Government has made major efforts to extend sterilization. In both&#13;
countries, fertility has fallen substantially and, some donors and channels&#13;
believe, in good part because of the family planning programs. Projection&#13;
acceptance has "plateaued" in some areas where services are well&#13;
established; on the other hand, even in Thailand and Indonesia many people&#13;
in scattered rural areas still lack ready access to family planning.33/&#13;
3.49       Such programs receive massive assistance from UNFPA, the World&#13;
Bank, USAID, and most other bilateral donors. But even here the private&#13;
organizations continue to work on the frontiers, reaching hard-to-reach&#13;
groups such as adolescents or hard-to-reach areas such as remote islands,&#13;
rural uplands, or jungles; helping establish safe sterilization as an&#13;
option; and strengthening broad public support and official interest.&#13;
Exploratory efforts to test how development influences demand for family&#13;
planning, particularly by improving women's opportunities or by providing&#13;
development-oriented incentives, are likely to occur in these same&#13;
countries, as birth rates begin to fall but faster progress is sought.&#13;
Total assistance to these programs remains substantial, focusing on&#13;
services and training but covering all areas.    In some countries, bilateral&#13;
assistance may have begun to phase out, though donors may fear to pull out&#13;
precipitously.&#13;
B. LATIN AMERICAN AND THE CARIBBEAN&#13;
3.50       In Latin America and the Caribbean over the past decade develop-&#13;
ment has progressed rapidly. Per capita incomes often exceed $1,000 though&#13;
income is distributed unevenly and much poverty persists. But life&#13;
expectancy at birth for women is 66 years, almost three-fourths of women&#13;
are literate, and most women meet their calorie requirements. Simulta-&#13;
neously, demand for family planning has intensified. Vigorous program&#13;
efforts initiated by national family planning associations have found "ripe&#13;
conditions" and have grown. In most of the larger countries, governments&#13;
support family planning and are expanding their programs. Family size as&#13;
measured by the total fertility rate averages only 4.4, down from over 6 in&#13;
1970.&#13;

3.51      In 1981, the crude birth rate in Latin Amerlca was roughly 31,&#13;
the- crude death rate 8. The population growth rate remained high at 2.3&#13;
but is undoubtedly lower today as birth rates are dropping quite quickly in&#13;
several major countries. (Initially family planning may substitute&#13;
extensively for abortion, which still practiced extensively though&#13;
illegally.) Many countries now report high and rising family planning&#13;
practice. In Mexico two-fifths of fertile-age, couples now practice family&#13;
planning, in Colombia almost half the fertile-age couples practice family&#13;
planning, in Peru one third do, and in Venezuela half.&#13;
3.52      Family planning in Latin America began-with private efforts to&#13;
extend services to two or three major areas to test the waters, while offi-&#13;
cial government policy remained ambiguous and official action limited at&#13;
best. Simultaneously, governments initiated primary health care programs.&#13;
The family planning component was often weak, but the infrastructure was&#13;
there when the climate for family planning improved.&#13;
3.53      Meanwhile, the family planning associations expanded family plan-&#13;
ning considerably, as in Colombia, Brazil and Peru, with the increasing&#13;
support of government. Assistance via the major private channels was cri-&#13;
tical at this stage. Assistance from UNFPA also increased. Real levels of&#13;
assistance held roughly steady recently until 1981; three-fourths now goes&#13;
for family planning, down from 90% in 1978.&#13;
3.54      In some countries, notably Mexico and Colombia, as demand for&#13;
family planning grew and services proved safe and practical, governments&#13;
have come to support family planning officially and to extend services as&#13;
part of broader PHC. Peru and several Central American countries are&#13;
moving in this direction, assisted primarily by UNFPA and USAID. Nonethe-&#13;
less, private efforts remain critical. The world's largest private family&#13;
-planning organizations are the national family planning associations of&#13;
Brazil and Colombia. The national family planning association of Colombia&#13;
still provides 40% of contraceptive services, Brazil's BEMFAM is the prin-&#13;
cipal source of subsidized family planning in that country and private&#13;
groups provide much of the urban services in Mexico. Several other coun-&#13;
tries remain at earlier stages, where family planning components of&#13;
government programs are still weak and private organizations provide much&#13;
of what services are available. Commerical distribution efforts are also&#13;
particularly strong in Latin America, particularly in Mexico and Brazil.&#13;
These have been supported largely by USAID but also by UNFPA and&#13;
Pathfinder. The outstanding private programs of Brazil, Colombia, and&#13;
Mexico are discussed further in Chapter IV's sections on private&#13;
organizations.&#13;
C. AFRICA AND THE NEAR EAST&#13;
3.55      Population in Africa is growing faster than in any other region--&#13;
2.7% p.a. on average, 3.5%-4% in several countries including Nigeria,&#13;
Kenya, and Zambia. Birth rates are very high--over 50 in some ar;eas. But&#13;
death rates have dropped in the wake of initial improvements in nutrition,&#13;
sanitation, and health care and efforts to control malaria and other&#13;
parasitic diseases. (Even so, maternal and child health remains the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
poorest of any major region. The infant mortality rate averages 155-160).&#13;
Family size (TFR) averages about 6.5 children. The picture in the Near&#13;
East is roughly similar.&#13;
3.56      The implications of rapid population growth and high fertility in&#13;
Africa vary and are not yet always fully understood. Africa is the poorest&#13;
major region; economies are largely agricultural, but food supplies are&#13;
inadequate and have actually fallen in per capita terms for several years.&#13;
The explanations for these food problems are complex, and the extent and&#13;
role of "population pressure" varies. In some countries no immediate&#13;
shortage of arable land exists, Elsewhere, although much land appears&#13;
vacant or underused, carrying capacity may be constrained by aridity or&#13;
presence of intractable disease. In some countries supplies of practically&#13;
usable arable land have dwindled to the point where population pressure&#13;
cannot be ignored--in Kenya land fragmentation and disputes over control of&#13;
land are major problems worsening rapidly in face of a population now&#13;
doubling every seventeen years. (Yet children serve key economic and&#13;
social functions, of course.) Thus, differences in fact, compounded by&#13;
differences in perception, exist on the extent of "population pressure".&#13;
Hope persists that investments in irrigation, new crops, fertilizers, etc.,&#13;
to make existing land more productive and further technical change will&#13;
ward off any real crisis,&#13;
3.57      Nonetheless, donors and channels are increasingly concerned at&#13;
the health and development implications of high fertility in Africa; this&#13;
concern is increasingly shared, though still generally limited in the&#13;
region. Several governments are dismayed at the sheer size of projected&#13;
populations that will require productive jobs, basic education, health&#13;
care, and, of course, food. Some, including Botswana, the Gambia, Ghana,&#13;
Kenya, Mauritius, Senegal, the Seychelles, and Swaziland, have adopted&#13;
population policies aimed at bringing population growth into line with&#13;
development capacity and objectives. Egypt has long been concerned, along&#13;
with Tunisia and Morocco.&#13;
3.58      Many African and Near Eastern countries lack even rudimentary&#13;
demographic information and are anxious to understand their situations, and&#13;
they have requested assistance in demography and policy areas particularly&#13;
from UNFPA. Dozens of such countries are now completing first censuses or&#13;
establishing vital registration systems with UNFPA help.&#13;
3.59      Moreover, many African countries share particularly severe&#13;
maternal and child health problems that delaying pregnancy and spacing&#13;
births can affect. Early and continuous childbearing increases the odds of&#13;
maternal depletion and infant weakness especially where food and health&#13;
care are scarce, as it is in Africa. The adverse impact on maternal and&#13;
child health of too many and too frequent pregnancies is apparent. Yet the&#13;
number of prenancies per woman may be rising, reflecting weakening of&#13;
traditional values and traditional child spacing techniques (such as&#13;
post-partum abstinence) during the process of modernization. Strong&#13;
pronatalist tradition, perhaps reflecting even higher child mortality in&#13;
times past, persists. Nonetheless, many countries (including Ethiopia,&#13;
Lesotho, Nigeria, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda and Zambia) support family&#13;
planning for reasons of health and family welfare if not explicitly as a&#13;
means of facilitating broader development progress.    (Francophone countries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 &#13;
tend to give less support even for health reasons, though some-e.g. , Zaire&#13;
and Mali--are beginning to shift.)&#13;
3.60      Most African countries seek to extend primary health care to deal&#13;
with their particularly severe threats to health--not only conwon resp4ra-'&#13;
tory and diarrheal infections, but also widespread and severe forms of&#13;
malaria, parasitic diseases, and measles, and the effects of b.'gh fertil-&#13;
ity0 In many countries no more than a fifth of the population now -.ias&#13;
regular access to modern primary health care, mostly in urban centers0&#13;
Many governments have blueprints for major health care programn based on&#13;
outreach. Some have embarked on implementation, though rural cuÂ£treach is&#13;
incipient at besto Family planning may be included in principle&#13;
particularly for child-spacing, which can markedly improve maternal and&#13;
child health in the conditions Africa faceso But family plann:'ng programs&#13;
remain limited0  Major health programs in large countries may be assisted&#13;
by multi-donor groups involving the World Bank or UNFPA and several&#13;
bilateral donors, while smaller countries may be helped largely by UNFPA,&#13;
other U.N. organizations or USAID or perhaps a Scandanavian country.&#13;
Sudan, Kenya, Tanzania, Ghana, Nigeria, and Zaire are cases lr point0&#13;
Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia have been extending PHC and family planning&#13;
more broadly, however, and some reports suggest promising declines in&#13;
fertility0&#13;
3o6l      In the meantime, nationaL family planning associat'-cns affiliated&#13;
with IPPF are encouraging official interest and beginning to I.ntroduce&#13;
family planning quietly0 This typically leads soon after to broad-gauged&#13;
information programs, emphasizing the health benefits of chil&amp;-spacingo&#13;
Then family planning services may be extended on a limited scel%e--through&#13;
private organizations including the national family planning associaticn&#13;
and perhaps FPIA or Pathfinder, or possibly through operations research&#13;
funded by USAID but conducted by universities or other local '.nstitutions.&#13;
Examples include national family planning associations' efforts in Ghana,&#13;
Ethiopia, and Zaire, FPIA's three community-based distribution projects in&#13;
Kenya, and USAID's operations research in the Sudan, Zaire, and in one&#13;
entire state of Nigeria0   In several countries (e.g., Botswana, Ethiopia,&#13;
Liberia, and Mali) private organizations have been asked by governments to&#13;
help initiate or strengthen the family planning component of PHC.&#13;
3.62      As family planning gets started in Africa, it is usually highly&#13;
conservative--relying on IUDs and barrier methods, perhaps pi'llJ5s, and&#13;
passive urban clinics supplying services "if asked"0 But some efforts have&#13;
begu.L to reach limited rural areas, as in FP7.A's Kenya and Sud&amp;a projects&#13;
or USAID's operations research projects in the Sudan, Zaire and Nigeria,&#13;
mentioned above0&#13;
3.63      In recent years, most donors and channels have made particular&#13;
efforts to provide assistance to Africa0   Although opportunit:es are&#13;
increasing, they remain limited--and assistance in real terms is lcw and&#13;
declining0 In the Near East, assistance is also low but increasing0&#13;
Egypt, Tunisia, and Morocco are major recipients.&#13;

5. Population Assistance Flows by Functional Category&#13;
3.64      Population assistance flows can be broken down further into eight&#13;
major categories, according to UNFPA (incorporating biomedical and&#13;
operations research into "family planning"):&#13;
1. Basic Data Collection&#13;
The collection of data and the development and strengthening of&#13;
capacity to collect basic data of population via censuses, surveys, and&#13;
registration systems.&#13;
2. Population Dynamics&#13;
Research, training, institution building and the dissemination of&#13;
findings concerning the causes and effects of population trends.&#13;
3. Formulation and evaluation of population policies and programs&#13;
Development, promotion and evaluation of governmental policies&#13;
and programs in population, including the integration of demographic&#13;
factors in socio-economic plans.&#13;
4. Implementation of Policies&#13;
Implementation of policies designed to influence population size&#13;
and growth: policies affecting fertility (other than family planning),&#13;
sterility and sub-fecundity, morbidity and mortality, internal and&#13;
international migration.&#13;
5. Family Planning Programs&#13;
Development and strengthening of family planning service systems,&#13;
their management and evaluation, including the development of safe and&#13;
effective fertility regulation methods. (This also includes related&#13;
maternal and child health services and biomedical and operations research).&#13;
6. Communication and Education&#13;
Communication for awareness of population issues; the promotion&#13;
and development of knowledge and attitudes concerning population in&#13;
educational programs conducted within school systems and by education&#13;
extension programs.&#13;
7. Special Programs&#13;
Implementation of programs to improve the status of special&#13;
target groups, e.g., women, children and youth, the aged, the economically&#13;
active, the disadvantaged and those affected by natural disasters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68&#13;
80 Multisector Activities&#13;
Multidisciplinary training and research; the development and&#13;
strengthening of the capacity to respond to program needs of the field of&#13;
population.34/&#13;
3.65      As the attached tables suggest, about two-thirds of population&#13;
assistance now goes to family planning services and closely related mater-&#13;
nal and child health care, down from roughly three-fourths in the past&#13;
several years. Multisectoral efforts (combining demand and supply) have&#13;
risen to over one-tenth of the total in recent years0 Demographic data,&#13;
population dynamics, and population policies--which together constitute the&#13;
core of policy-makers' information-have risen from only 6o6% in 1977 to&#13;
almost 16% in 1981, reflecting increasing interest of policy -akers parti-&#13;
cularly in Africa in population issues. (Before 1977, data ware collected&#13;
by OECD under somewhat different categories; they can be used only for&#13;
rough comparison). Bearing this in mind, trends over 1977-81 suggest&#13;
growth in demographic information and policy formulation and "demand side"&#13;
special projects and a relative decline in family planning services0    1982&#13;
data will probably show an increase in the family planni'ng share, however,&#13;
particularly because UNFPA is focusing more on family planningo&#13;
E. Population Assistance Flows by Category and Destination&#13;
3.66      Breaking UNFPA9s 1981 data dowfn further by region reveals program&#13;
patterns associated with each region's overall stage of development (though&#13;
intraregional variations naturally are significanit)0 Africa, generally&#13;
with early-stage interest in population and family planning, shows a low&#13;
total for population assistance and within that a relatively ringh share&#13;
(about one-fourth) for "early stage" activities such as basic datE collec-&#13;
tion, policy development, and population dynamics and even informationo&#13;
Nonetheless over half of population assistance in Africa went for family&#13;
planning services0   In Latin America and the Middle East, Ksditeranean, and&#13;
Europe programs vary widely but on average represent middle stagesO Thus&#13;
data collection, population dynamics, and policy development account for&#13;
only one-sixth of expenditures, while family planning programs account for&#13;
three-fourths0 In the mature programs of Asia, data collection, population&#13;
dynamics, and policy development account for less than one-tenth of&#13;
expenditures while services account for 84%--and Asia receives half of all&#13;
regional assistance0&#13;
3.67      But in every region population assistance focuses on famlly&#13;
planning (and related health) programs0 Two-thirds of all populatfon&#13;
assistance goes for family planning, or three-fourths of the portion&#13;
allocated by regiono Asia has the highest share, but even in Africa most&#13;
population assistance goes to family planning (though the "re:.ated health"&#13;
is likely to be proportionately higher in Africa)0 This is partly because&#13;
services absorb expenditures more readily than demographic or policy&#13;
development efforts can0 But it also shows that family planning programEs&#13;
can be and are undertaken even in difficult c!rcumstences today.&#13;

CHAPTER IV&#13;
MAJOR CHANNELS OF ASSISTANCE&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
4.01      The major channels for population assistance--UNFPA, the major&#13;
private organizations, and bilateral programs particularly of USAID--&#13;
complement each other reasonably well. The World Bank also fits into the&#13;
pattern. No precise division of labor has emerged, since developing&#13;
country conditions vary widely and each "channel" may be asked to cover a&#13;
range of activities in a given country. Moreover, coordinating multi-donor&#13;
efforts can be difficult if one's activity depends in a practical way on&#13;
another's. Nonetheless a rough pattern can be discerned.l/&#13;
4.02      UNFPA primarily assists governments.   It is a core source of&#13;
support for primary health care and family planning programs, for&#13;
information programs in and out of school, and for demographic data and&#13;
policy development. It covers the broadest range of needs and has&#13;
comparative advantage in "start-up" efforts where population remains a&#13;
sensitive issue.&#13;
4.03      The private organizations are the "pathfinders", the innovators&#13;
who test the political winds, show that well designed family planning&#13;
services will be welcomed, and improve family planning methods. They work&#13;
largely with private organizations in the third world but sometimes assist&#13;
governments.&#13;
4.04      USAID's bilateral assistance goes not only to other governments,&#13;
but also to universities, research institutions, and other private firms&#13;
working in population. USAID also provides core support for government&#13;
primary health care and family planning programs, for which it is a princi-&#13;
pal source of contraceptives (and the main source of pills). When possible&#13;
it concentrates on the interface between service provider and client,&#13;
extending and improving outreach. It also supports biomedical and opera-&#13;
tions research heavily and assists with specialized training, policy&#13;
development, and analytic demography.&#13;
4.05      The World Bank has led in multi-donor efforts to support the&#13;
extension of major primary health care and family planning programs. It&#13;
has tended to include construction of clinics and provision of other&#13;
infrastructure in its own contribution, but assists with training,&#13;
management advice, and other service-related areas. Its scope is&#13;
broadening substantially as its lending in this field grows. It also&#13;
covers population in policy dialogue and supports related analysis and&#13;
research.&#13;
4.06      Other nations' bilateral assistance goes primarily to government&#13;
PHC and family planning projects, often in cooperation with the World Bank,&#13;
which may help arrange multi-donor efforts. The United Kingdom assists a&#13;
number of countries (many with ties to Britain), Sweden now assists&#13;

Bangladesh and Kenya, Japan assists several countrles particu:arly in Asia,&#13;
and so on. But several, notably the United Yingdom and Sweden, have also&#13;
supported substantial biomedical research, and since 1982 WHO has sponsored&#13;
a Special Programme for Research in Human Reproduction that h&amp;s attracted&#13;
broad support from several donors. Some bilateral assistance goes to&#13;
special efforts, such as Norway's All-India Post-Partum Program or Sweden's&#13;
arrangement with UNFPA to support sex education in Mexico's schools0&#13;
Modest bilateral assistance also goes to other private organLzations, e.g.,&#13;
hospitals in Africa.&#13;
A0 UNFPA&#13;
4.07      The main multilateral channel for population assistance is the&#13;
United Nations Fund for Population Activities, which has provided over $1&#13;
billion in population assistance over 1969-19820 UNFPA's annual expendi-&#13;
ture level in recent years has averaged about $135 million--t7h1e equivalent&#13;
of about one-third of DAC ODA for population. It assists sowe 127&#13;
countries and territories, including the vast majority of developing&#13;
countries.&#13;
4008      UNFPA was established as a Trust Fund in 1967 by the Secretary&#13;
General in response to a   1966 resolution of the General Assembly and began&#13;
operating in 1969.2/ It w^^as placed under the authority of the General&#13;
Assembly in 1972 (affirmed in 1979)o It actually reports prlmarily to the&#13;
Governing Council of UNDP, but also to the General Assembly E7'd to ECOSOCo&#13;
UNDP's Resident Representatives abroad act as UNFPA's field&#13;
representatives0&#13;
4.09      The United States exercised considerable leadership in the estab-&#13;
lishment of UNFPA and has long been its leadlng donor. It novy provides&#13;
about one-sixth of its population assistance, roughly $33-35 million in&#13;
recent years, to cover about one-fourth of UNFPA's program0 But this&#13;
represents a sharp proportional decline from earlier years as UNFPA's&#13;
funding base has expanded. By 1982 some 130 countries had contributed&#13;
about $850 million to UNFPAo Currently about 90 countries contribute.&#13;
Other major donors now include Japan, Germany, Norway, the Netherlands,&#13;
Sweden, Canada, Denmark, and the United Kingdom03/&#13;
4.10      While UNFPA's program has grown rapidly, its income has not kept&#13;
pace with program opportunities0 UNEFPA now has a project backlog of&#13;
between $50-100 million and can fund only about two-thirds of its&#13;
requests0 In fact, the Governing Council approved programs of' about $147&#13;
million in 1981 and $144 million in 1982, but shortfalls in expected&#13;
contributions occurred as development assistance generally suffered from&#13;
economic declines in many donor nations0 UNFPA was obliged to cut its 1981&#13;
program to about $136 million and its 1982 program to $123.7 million0 It&#13;
also scaled down its 1982-85 work plan from $736 million to about $629&#13;
million and most recently to only $549.1 million, via program stretchouts&#13;
and cancellations even in key regions such as Africa and in priority fields&#13;

such as family plannin%. More recent plans for 1983-1987 have been&#13;
similarly constrained.-/&#13;
What UNFPA Does&#13;
4.11      UNFPA was established to (a) respond to national, regional,&#13;
inter-regional, and global needs in the population and family planning&#13;
field...; (b) promote awareness, both in developed and in developing&#13;
countries, of the social, economic, and environmental implications of&#13;
national and international population problems...; (c) extend population&#13;
assistance to countries "in forms and by means requested by the recipient&#13;
countries"...; (d) "play a leading role in the United Nations system in&#13;
promoting population programs."5/&#13;
4.12      UNFPA is involved in some way in the population and family&#13;
planning efforts of most developing countries. UNFPA is particularly able&#13;
to take the lead in helping interested governments map out approaches and&#13;
organize resources to deal with population issues. The resources of&#13;
population assistance have been critical to establishing family planning&#13;
and other population programs; but technical advice and management support&#13;
have been almost as important. UNFPA has helped in each area. Among all&#13;
donors, it is perhaps in the most natural position to exert leadership,&#13;
although the World Bank could do so as well. But UNFPA's raison d'etre is&#13;
population, while the Bank covers all of development.&#13;
4.13      UNFPA's political neutrality enables it more easily to broach&#13;
discussion of population issues and to offer population assistance in an&#13;
uncharged atmosphere. It has thus provided leadership in developing popu-&#13;
lation policy and program strategy in the last decade, particularly where&#13;
population remains a sensitive issue. Since 1977 UNFPA has undertaken&#13;
"Needs Assessments" to help individual countries analyze their demographic&#13;
situation and design population assistance programs covering family plan-&#13;
ning services and information, demographic analysis, policy analysis, etc.&#13;
to support their own objectives.6/ UNFPA has prepared some 70 Needs&#13;
Assessments--27 in Africa, 23 in Asia, 9 in Latin America, and 11 in the&#13;
Middle East and Mediterranean. These have provided valuable background&#13;
information for most other donors, and "channels", including the World&#13;
Bank, as well as for UNFPA and the developing countries concerned. (Norway&#13;
has particularly assisted this effort.)&#13;
4.14      If countries request population assistance, UNFPA can respond&#13;
flexibly, quickly, and with relatively streamlined bureaucratic procedures,&#13;
all of which appeal to recipient nations. It can also offer grant funds,&#13;
which appeal particularly in fields like family planning, health, and&#13;

education, wihere many costs recur annually. It is amassing experience in&#13;
family planning services and information as developing countr4.es' demand&#13;
for assistance rises. But it also takes a "broad view" of population and&#13;
funds other kinds of activities thought to bear on population and family&#13;
planning issues. UNFPA funds core activities of major governLrent programs&#13;
of family planning and health care but assists private organizations, and&#13;
supports extensive research on all aspects of poulation and other&#13;
innovative efforts. It encourages others to do so as well07/&#13;
4o15      From the donors' viewpoint, UNFPA offers several advantageso    Its&#13;
political neutrality enables it to assist many countries that donors would&#13;
like to assist but where bilateral assistance is inappropriate and private&#13;
organizations may not operate on a significant scale. Of course, it may&#13;
support certain types of activities or assist certain regions or countries&#13;
more or less than any one donor would0   Its flexibility is an advantage in&#13;
accelerating response to opportunities where fast response matterso It is&#13;
also administratively efficient0 Finally, it "multiplies" the contribu-&#13;
tions of any one donor by attracting contributions from many others0&#13;
4.16      UNFPA devotes about two-fifths of its funds to suppcrting exten-&#13;
sion of government primary health care and family planning programs0 It&#13;
now assists several programs in the critical shift from pilot efforts to&#13;
programs covering tens of millions of people0 It and the World Bank are&#13;
best able to organize multi-donor efforts to assist such government&#13;
programs0 For example, UNFPA has provided major support in Bangladesh,&#13;
Egypt, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Thailand0 In&#13;
Bangladesh it provides technical advice, contraceptives, medicInes, and&#13;
other supplies to help the government establish stronger PRC&#13;
outreach0 In India it concentrates on assisting the government PHC program&#13;
particularly at the village level in two of the poorest states, Bihar and&#13;
Rajasthan, with some 80 million people. It is also supplying&#13;
contraceptives and raw materials for production of pills and    UDs and to&#13;
improve voluntary sterilization services0 In Pakistan it supports&#13;
extension of PHC including family planning to over 30 million people0 In&#13;
Egypt it supports extension of village-level family planning for some 14&#13;
million people, in conjunction with community incentives (interest-free&#13;
loans to support projects of village choice)--with encouraging results.&#13;
4.17      UNFPA has also assisted with a number of innovative information&#13;
programs through schools, women's organizations, commercial channels, and&#13;
so ono In Bangladesh it has helped train some 12,000 teachers; and in&#13;
Mexico it is working with Sweden to bring sex education to all. primary&#13;
school childreno   It has undertaken broad informational progrzas in dozens&#13;
of other countries throughout the third worldo UNFPA has also experimented&#13;
more than most donors with "demand side" effortsG-particularly research and&#13;
actual programs to improve women's opportunities while extendiag family&#13;
planning information and services.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
4.18      Of course, UNFPA has led in establishing a worldwide demographic&#13;
data base by assisting many countries with first and second modern&#13;
censuses, strengthening vital registration, supporting the World Fertility&#13;
Survey, and other demographic data collection and analysis.&#13;
Functional Categories of Assistance&#13;
4.19      More precisely, UNFPA can provide assistance in all the basic&#13;
categories described earlier:&#13;
(a) basic data collection;&#13;
(b) population dynamics;&#13;
(c) formulation and evaluation of population policies and&#13;
programs;&#13;
(d) implementation of policies;&#13;
(e) family planning programs;&#13;
(f) communication and education;&#13;
(g) special programs; and&#13;
(h) multisector activities.&#13;
The specific kinds of activities funded under each of these broad catego-&#13;
ries include: general, support, training, research, communication and&#13;
dissemination of information, action programs, and other. UNFPA also&#13;
encourages technical cooperation among developing countries. It will&#13;
support expert/advisory services; fellowships; seminars and conferences;&#13;
equipment; medical supplies including contraceptives, books and other&#13;
supplies; vehicles and, on an exceptional basis, some construction and&#13;
renovation.&#13;
4.20      Beyond its country programs, UNFPA provides worldwide leadership&#13;
in helping organize and analyze global demographic data (in cooperation&#13;
with other arms of the United Nations), in monitoring worldwide expendi-&#13;
tures on population issues and programs and worldwide population assist-&#13;
ance, and in organizing worldwide conferences, such as the World Population&#13;
Conference in Bucharest in 1974 and the International Population Conference&#13;
in Mexico in 1984.8/&#13;
4.21      In practice, as Table 4.1 shows, UNFPA spends about two-fifths of&#13;
its funds on family planning (and related material and child health); about&#13;
one-fifth on demographic data; almost one-fifth on policy development and&#13;
related research; and about one-fifth on communication, education, and&#13;
other areas. The data for for 1969-82 show modest shifts in emphasis, with&#13;

an increase in demographics and policy formation and declIne in family&#13;
planning until 1981 and generally a reversal of these trends tahereafter.&#13;
Occasionally, UNFPA gives special support to priority areas, szch as&#13;
biomedical research, often singling out promising multilateral programs&#13;
such as WHOs9 reproductive biology research program.&#13;

Increasing Program Focus:     More Attention to Family Planning&#13;
4,22       UNFPA has long been convinced that a broad approach to population&#13;
makes most sense; it thus worked to organize the W7orld Populatfion&#13;
Conference in 1974 and draft the WIorld Population Plan of Action, whIch&#13;
called for establishment of family planning services and information and&#13;
promotion of development activities conducive to smaller famil`.es.&#13;
4.23       Nonetheless, its donors have pressed for somewhat greater focus&#13;
on family planning to ensure maximum impact of limited funds,          In 1981,&#13;
UNFPA's Governing Council voted for a more fccused approach In the future,&#13;
giving highest priority to family planning.&#13;
Increasing Country Focus:     The Priority Countries&#13;
4,24       Recent resource limitations have obliged UNFPA to fccus its&#13;
efforts more by country.     In 1977 it identif led 40 "priority" countries,&#13;
including the larger and poorer countries where population growth is&#13;
substantial (and thus excluding much of Latin America), and 13 "borderline"Â°&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
countries.9/ By the end of 1980, UNFPA had provided large-scale&#13;
assistance to 38 of these countries. All the "borderline" countries had&#13;
also received large-scale assistance. In 1980 its governing council&#13;
changed the threshold values of the criteria to determine priority status&#13;
and the priority list was revised to include some 53 countries.10/ Thirty&#13;
of these are in Africa, sixteen in Asia, two in Latin America, and five in&#13;
the Middle East and Mediterranean. UNFPA has attempted to provide about&#13;
two-thirds of its country resources to these countries; it exceeded its&#13;
goal in 1982, when they received some 69%.&#13;

Geographic Distribution of UNFPA Assistance&#13;
4.25      In regional terms, the distribution of UNFPA assistance has&#13;
shifted somewhat, reflecting the increasing concentration on priority&#13;
countries. Africa's share has climbed to almost 17% and Asia's to almost&#13;
43%. Inter-regional and global programs have both dropped substantially in&#13;
the wake of efforts to concentrate more on the priority countries.&#13;

4.26       Historical trends in UNFPA data through 1982 broken dotlin both by&#13;
functional category and regional destination reflect increasing interest in&#13;
policy development and family planning in all regions and the shift toward&#13;
priority countries.&#13;
1  UI'FPA in Africa&#13;
4.27       To support emerging interest in population in Africa, UNFPA&#13;
has recently helped about 30 countries in Africa carry out first censuses;&#13;
it has also supported demographic surveys9 vital registration systems, and&#13;
other demographic activitieso Now these "early stage" activities are&#13;
winding down and requests for support for family planning are increasing.&#13;
4.28       UNFPA's support for maternal and child health and family planning&#13;
in Africa has grown--from 19% of UNTFPA assistance in 1981 to 26% in 1982-=&#13;
"an indication of the growing concern on the part of many governments to&#13;
reduce the high infant mortality and maternal morbidity and to improve the&#13;
health of mothers and children through child-spacing activitiest'.     In l982&#13;
alone, UNFPA helped nine countries initiate family health activities,      Some&#13;
24 countries received UNFPA assistance for educational progra&amp;s on family&#13;
planning and population in and out of schoolo&#13;

2. UNFPA in Asia.&#13;
4.29       Reflecting longstanding government commitment to reducing popu-&#13;
lation growth in Asia, UNFPA has concentrated on supporting government&#13;
efforts to extend primary health care and family planning, which now&#13;
accounts for 56% of its assistance. Of the 16 priority countries in Asia,&#13;
Bangladesh, India, and especially Indonesia haye already achieved substan-&#13;
tial family planning coverage with help from UNFPA and other donors. China&#13;
has only received help on the demographic front--with its first modern&#13;
census. Thailand, though not a priority country, has also received&#13;
substantial UNFPA assistance for its major family planning program. UNFPA&#13;
has worked particularly to promote sound program management, assure&#13;
adequate supplies of contraceptives (assisting an Indonesian effort to&#13;
manufacture, pills in conjunction with USAID), and strengthen training.&#13;
4.30       Some 15 countries continue to receive UNFPA assistance for&#13;
informational and educational activities, particularly for incorporating&#13;
family planning and sex education into school curricula (e.g., in&#13;
Bangladesh and India.)&#13;

4.31       UNFPA provides relatively little assistance on demographic and&#13;
policy development efforts in Asia, reflecting past efforts to develop a&#13;
demographic data base and strong earlier commitment to extending family&#13;
planning in most of the Asian countries.&#13;
3. UNFPA in Latin America and the Caribbean&#13;
4.32       Here UNFPA continues to concentrate on supporting maternal and&#13;
child health and family planning programs in response to strong and growing&#13;
government interest. UNFPA now assists some 24 countries and territories,&#13;
focusing on extending coverage and improving quality of care and manage-&#13;
ment. Some support goes to "natural family planning" in Chile and&#13;
Ecuador.&#13;
4.33       In information and education, UNFPA helped incorporate population&#13;
components into school curricula in five countries and provided education&#13;
on responsible parenthood for teenagers in five other countries, reflecting&#13;
growing concern for adolescent pregnancy particularly out of wedlock.&#13;
4.34       In 11 countries UNFPA has recently assisted efforts to integrate&#13;
population policies more fully into development plans and program. These&#13;
include preparation of a national demographic diagnosis and investigation&#13;
into the Bolivia, Brazil, Mexico and Panama.&#13;

4. UNFPA in the Middle East, Mediterranean, and Europe&#13;
4.35       Here UNFPA assistance has focused on two principal categories:&#13;
family planning and demographic data and other policy development. This&#13;
reflects the composite nature of the regiono Some countries, notably Egypt&#13;
and Morocco, have undertaken ambitfons family planning and primary health&#13;
care programs, while others are laying the demographic groundwork needed&#13;
for broader policy development.&#13;

Executing Agencies&#13;
4.36       UNFPA executes some projects itself, others through other U.N.&#13;
organizations, some through recipient governments themselves, and a few&#13;
through non-government organizations. Some developing countries (e.g.,&#13;
Indonesia) have pressed UNFPA to use governments and non-government&#13;
agencies further.&#13;

4.38      In sum, UNFPA is the major channel through which population&#13;
assistance reaches the third world. It responds to developing countries'&#13;
needs flexibly and sensitively, and it exercises worldwide leadership in&#13;
building interest in population issues and in establishing policies and&#13;
programs to deal with those issues.&#13;
B. The Major Private Organizations&#13;
4.39      The major private channels for official population assistance&#13;
are the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), Family Planning&#13;
International Assistance (FPIA), Pathfinder Fund, and Association for&#13;
Voluntary Sterilization (AVS). Their total annual program level is almost&#13;
$130 million--IPPF at about $90 million, FPIA at about $20 million,&#13;
Pathfinder at about $7 million, and AVS at about $10 million. The United&#13;
States provides about $50 million (almost all of FPIA, Pathfinder, and AVS&#13;
funding). The developing countries themselves contribute around $40&#13;
million (largely to IPPF) and much more in time and resources-in-kind.&#13;
Several other organizations are also active in population, largely in&#13;
research, technical assistance, or small-scale programs, including Ford and&#13;
Rockefeller Foundations with a combined program level of about $8 million,&#13;
and the Population Council at about $15 million. (Ford and Rockefeller&#13;
receive no ODA; the Population Council receives some).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
86&#13;
4.40      The private organizations have collectively worked to push the&#13;
family planning frontiers out--by helping establish policles that reflect&#13;
population issues and that support family planning, by initiating and&#13;
extending safe, effective, affordable, and acceptable family planning&#13;
services, and by promoting public understanding of family planning and&#13;
population. They provide continuity even during political upheaval and&#13;
often set standards for cost-effectiveness0 They work with a wide range of&#13;
public and private institutions.&#13;
4.41      Private organizations   efforts are part and parcel of developing&#13;
countries' own efforts to extend serviLces and informationo Often LDC&#13;
governments explicitly ask their family plannlng association (FPA) to help&#13;
initiate family planning services wlthin a government primary health care&#13;
program, or to cover a hard-to-reach Tegion or group of people, or intro-&#13;
duce a new family planning method, or provide education and information in&#13;
conjunction with government primary health care. Governments also look to&#13;
FPIA or Pathfinder to assist similarly, w^sorking through indigenous organi-&#13;
zations (sometimes the FPA)O Often--perhaps typically--governments look to&#13;
the private organizations and their deve1oping-country partner organiza-&#13;
tions for guidance in designing broader family planning programs0 Govern-&#13;
ments and, at their request, UNFPA and the World Bank have frequently taken&#13;
over and built upon the foundations laid by private organizations0&#13;
4.42      While the private organizations continue to establish supportive&#13;
policies, get services started, and build public support for family plan-&#13;
ning, their major impact recently has been on delivery of family planning&#13;
services: showing that vigorous outreach can work better than passive&#13;
clinic-based services; introducing voluntary sterilization; and designing&#13;
creative approaches for reaching the hard-to-reach, often involving inte-&#13;
gration of family planning into other development efforts or community&#13;
activities0&#13;
4A43      IPPF, FPIA, and Pathfinder--often working together-have tested&#13;
and expanded major outreach programs relying on outreach or "community&#13;
based distribution" (CBD) of one form or another0 Such programs vary by&#13;
culture, geography, and economy, but typically involve networks of volun-&#13;
teer or nominally paid outreach workers linked into a public or private&#13;
health system and covering anywhere from a few hundred to several million&#13;
people0 Estimating cost and impact is, of course, hazardous, but the&#13;
private organizations believe these programs usually cost no more than a&#13;
few dollars per active user per annum ($2-7), or something around $o50-2000&#13;
per capita population depending on composition services, number of users,&#13;
population density, terrain, etc0 (This assumes pre-existlng clinics and&#13;
sometimes free contraceptives0) And they typically lead to comparatively&#13;
high "prevalence" of contraception--over 50% of couples of reproductive age&#13;
in many difficult areas including Bangladesh, Brazil's Wortheast, and rural&#13;
Colombia0 Prevalance rates of 15-20% are also reported in some pilot&#13;
programs in Kenya and Sudan0   These programs are too small to have national&#13;
demographic impact except in Colombia, Brazil, arguably Mexico and&#13;
Bangladesh and Indonesia, and several smaller countrieso RepAlcability-'&#13;
--management, financing, logistics---may not be easy or simple0 But key&#13;
elements of programs design involving outreach are finding their way Into&#13;
national programs0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -&#13;
4.44      The Association for Voluntary Sterilization leads the way in&#13;
providing safe and affordable sterilization, particularly through outpa-&#13;
tient techniques--vasectomy with local anesthesia and minilaparotomy or,&#13;
where conditions permit, laparoscopy. (Minilaparotomy with local anaesthe-&#13;
sia is often the technique of choice for female sterilization in developing&#13;
country conditions). FPAs have also initiated such programs, and Path-&#13;
finder and FPIA also support extension of sterilization. In a few coun-&#13;
tries, notably India and Bangladesh, governments are beginning to extend&#13;
voluntary sterilization programs, often looking to private organizations'&#13;
experience for guidance or technology, informed consent, and management.&#13;
The Bangladesh Association for Voluntary Sterilization, an affiliate of the&#13;
international AVS, accounts for about one fifth of Bangladesh's&#13;
sterilization acceptors.&#13;
4.45      The Population Council has supported extensive biomedical,&#13;
operations, and policy-related research and policy development efforts. It&#13;
has helped establish family planning particularly in Thailand and the&#13;
Philippines.&#13;
4.46      While the private organizations have worked to develop family&#13;
planning services that governments would take over, in Latin America pri-&#13;
vate programs provide much of subsidized family planning for the poor. The&#13;
two largest national family planning associations, Colombia's PROFAMILIA&#13;
and Brazil's BEMFAM, have both pioneered service delivery on a broad&#13;
scale. Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico also have major private programs&#13;
(Mexico's involving not only the FPA but a number of other indigenous&#13;
private organizations). In Bangladesh private organizations have been&#13;
asked to focus on urban areas and together provide significant coverage,&#13;
particularly through community-based outreach. In Thailand, Indonesia, and&#13;
the Philippines, private programs--in cooperation with government efforts--&#13;
have also made a demographic difference. Even here, however, every&#13;
private organizations work for government support of "regular" family&#13;
planning so that they are freer to do what they do best--innovate.&#13;
1. IPPF&#13;
4.47      Founded thirty years ago in India, IPPF is an international&#13;
federation of over 100 indigenous national family planning associations, or&#13;
FPAs--largely volunteer organizations with links to national leadersip and&#13;
the broader community. IPPF's 1983 program is about $90 million. IPPF&#13;
receives over half of its funds in contributions of official development&#13;
assistance (about $49 million in 1983) largely from a dozen OECD nations&#13;
including the United States ($12 million), West Germany, Japan, the Nordic&#13;
countries, and Canada.    It receives smaller amounts from UNFPA and from&#13;
some of the wealthier FPAs and other sources. About a third (roughly $34&#13;
million in 1983) is raised by the FPAs in developing countries often from&#13;
their own government, from sales of contraceptives, occasionally from&#13;
bilateral USAID or other sources. (See Table 4.11.) IPPF programs&#13;
directly serve some 5 million acceptors at an average cost of roughly $2.00&#13;
per user per year (ranging from under $1.00 in the Indian Ocean area to&#13;
about $2.60 in the Western Hemisphere, roughly estimated). IPPF indirectly&#13;
serves some 10 million acceptors. It has a substantial backlog of requests&#13;
for further assistance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -&#13;
4048      IPPF's worldwide activities in 1981, 1975, and 1970 are&#13;
summarized in Table 4M12, showing total expenditures with ths 2roportion&#13;
covered by IPPF grants given below0   (The difference is thus what the FPAS&#13;
raise themselves.)   The allocation of IPPF's oun grants to family planning&#13;
associations is summarized in Tables 4o12 and 40130&#13;
4.49      Among the private organizations, 9PPF and the national associa-&#13;
tions lead in establishing population policies, capitalizing on their&#13;
indigenous rootso The national asscciations remain vigorous advocates in&#13;
Asia and Latin America and are increasingly active in Africa.&#13;
4o5O      The national associations also lead in extending information to&#13;
build public understanding of family planning. Indeed IPFF sees this as&#13;
its second major role, at least in the long run, arguing that most services&#13;
should be provided by governmentso&#13;
4.51      The national associations have also led in initiating family&#13;
planning services, demonstrating safety, effectiveness, and affordability&#13;
and testing political acceptability. Hith care and sensitivilI:y to cultural&#13;
and political realities and insistence on quality medical care in their own&#13;
programs, they have formed alliances with governments of various levels in&#13;
several countrieso The associations are often asked to provide family&#13;
planning services and education as integral parts of broader government&#13;
primary health care or other public health programso As governments&#13;
gradually take over provision of some kinds of family planning services&#13;
(e.g., pills), the associations are asked to shift their focus to reaching&#13;
the "hard to reach" and introducing a broader range of family planning&#13;
services0 They then focus on pilot efforts in cterilization, commercial&#13;
sales of condoms, pills, etco, or joint efforts with wyomenl organizations,&#13;
youth organizations, civic organizations, labor unions, rural development&#13;
groups, etc0 to integrate family planning into their ownm efforts and show&#13;
how family planning affects wihat they are trying to achieve--in&#13;
development, improved health, or broader opportunities for dicadvantaged&#13;
groups0  (See table 40140)   Over half of IPPF's 5 million clients are in&#13;
Latin America, particularly Brazil and Colombia0   About one-tenth are in&#13;
Africa0 Only about one-fourth are In Asia, though that reflects broader&#13;
government family planning programs0 With perhaps 320 million fertile age&#13;
couples in the third world of whom perhaps 90-100 million practice family&#13;
planning, IPPF accounts for perhaps 10% of prevalence, but much more in&#13;
Colombia and Brazil. Its continuing efforts to encourage governments to&#13;
support family planning have also been critical0&#13;

(a) National Family Planning Associations in Latin America&#13;
4.52      Latin America has long been IPPF's leading region.    The Western&#13;
Hemisphere has many outstanding FPAs with substantial programs, including&#13;
the world's largest private programs--Brazil's BEMFAM, and Colombia's&#13;
PROFAMILIA. Guatemala's APFROFAM, Honduras's ASHONPLAFA, and Mexico's&#13;
FEPAC also run major programs.&#13;
4.53      Brazil's BEMFAM works to build a broad constituency in support of&#13;
family planning locally and ultimately within government. It is the&#13;
principal provider of subsidized family planning for the poor. BEMFAM was&#13;
established in 1965 by obstetricians and gynecologists alarmed at results&#13;
of research on abortion.&#13;
4.54      While the Federal Government still stops short of supporting&#13;
family planning, BEMFAM cooperates with State Governments to extend free&#13;
services through community-based distribution in seven major states,&#13;
including several in the impoverished Northeast. In 1980 BEMFAM served&#13;
over 300,000 new acceptors from its 2,000 various service points in most of&#13;
Brazil's 22 states, but the seven-state outreach program and accounts for&#13;
80% of its acceptors. Outreach approaches vary, but a description of the&#13;
Rio state effort is illustrative. There an outreach program serves some&#13;
one-million fertile-age women in union, through 180 distribution posts in&#13;
64 municipalities (which donated the space). Some 180 distributors and 200&#13;
community educations volunteer, backed by supervisory field workers and&#13;
physicians. Vigorous educational efforts are also underway. Reported&#13;
annual costs per acceptor (net of contraceptives) are only $3.50--about&#13;
half the level in other states, reflecting a more urbanized population&#13;
generally easier to reach.11/&#13;
4.55      BEMFAM is not the sole provider of services.    Many women receive&#13;
family planning services trom private physicians, pharmacies, and&#13;
traditional health-care priorities. But BEMFAM is the principal source of&#13;
subsidized services, for the poor. In the three northeastern states where&#13;
its CBD programs have run for several years, overall contraceptive use far&#13;
exceeds that in Bahia, where no program exists, or Piaui, where the program&#13;
is just starting. BEMFAM reports costs per active user (net of&#13;
contraceptives) $6-9 per annum, less in some urban areas. (Pathfinder and&#13;
FPIA each provide some assistance to BEMFAM outreach programs as discussed&#13;
below.)&#13;
4.56      Colombia's PROFAMILIA introduced community-based distribution of&#13;
services; voluntary sterilization; commercial distribution; radio&#13;
advertising; and local fund raising. It began family planning services by&#13;
working with the Coffee Growers' Associations, branched out to urban and&#13;
then rural outreach, and encouraged the Government to extend services,&#13;
though it still accounts for 40% of available services. PROFAMILIA seeks&#13;
more cost-effective ways to serve hard to reach groups and areas. In its&#13;
community-based distribution in both urban and rural areas, it achieved&#13;
impressive prevalence at a cost of only a few dollars per active user&#13;
annually (less than $3, net of contraceptives in urban areas). It now&#13;
11/ FPIA, Brazil Project Description and Budget, unpublished.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

provides community-based services even in the plains and jungles of&#13;
Colombia's remote outback0   It has experimented successfully w:ith charging&#13;
modest prices for services. Governments and private organizations&#13;
throughout Latin America have turned to PROFAMILIA for guidance.&#13;

4o57      In Africa and the Near East, where interest in population issues&#13;
is increasing but family planning renains sensitive, FPAs are not always&#13;
strong, but many are working to establish the acceptability and feasibility&#13;
of family planning by:&#13;
--  strengthening official interest in population and family planning&#13;
issues;&#13;
-  encouraging public support for family planning via broad&#13;
information and education programs;&#13;
-o   developing replicable models for delivering family planning as a&#13;
component of maternal and child health case;&#13;
providing family planning services and information through&#13;
private organizations0&#13;
4.58      In most African countries, family planning associations work&#13;
directly with governments to strengthen population policy and rZndertake&#13;
broader information programs aimed at promoting public interest in and&#13;
support for family planning0 Here FPAs can capitalize on thei-r strong&#13;
community roots and ties to government and on their international&#13;
federation which offers a look at family planning approaches outside&#13;
Africa.&#13;

4c59      In some African countries, FPAs are officially assicting&#13;
governments in establishing family planning components in primary health&#13;
care programs, usually at early stages with pilot activities in several&#13;
urban and perhaps some rural areas.&#13;
--  In Ethiopia, the family planning association is training&#13;
clinic staff and providing some services at the mid-levels&#13;
of an early-stage PHC program and assists with sex&#13;
education in schools and broader information programs;&#13;
--   In Tanzania, the family planning association supports&#13;
early-stage government efforts to extend PHC including&#13;
family planning by helping train staff1, procure&#13;
contraceptives, and educate the public on family planning&#13;
and parenthoodo&#13;
--   In Zaire, the National Committee on Desired Births&#13;
(CNND)--itself a government institution--coordinatee the&#13;
nascent family planning component of a broad PHC program&#13;
now getting underway, while working more broadly on policy&#13;
and informations.&#13;
4.60      In many countries the FPAs focus more on policy development,&#13;
information and innovative models of service delivery that governments can&#13;
adopt when proved effective (again often in close cooperation with&#13;
governments).&#13;
- In Kenya, the family planning association is strengt.hening&#13;
policy and extending information in conjunction with the&#13;
Government's primary health care program, assisted by&#13;
several donors, and working on more cost-effective family&#13;
planning services0&#13;
--   In Nigeria, the family planning association is testing&#13;
innovative ways of delivering family planning in a primary&#13;
health care project assisted by several donors, whill&#13;
working to strengthen policy and provide nationwide&#13;
information.&#13;
4o61      In other countries, FPAs are trying to supply services where&#13;
government primary health care programs do not reach, though coverage under&#13;
both primary health care and FPA programs is likely to be very limited0&#13;
--   In Ghana, the family planning association has specifically&#13;
agreed with government to focus on reaching certain areas&#13;
(usually urban), while the Government program concentrates&#13;
elsewhere, though services are very limited everywhere, and&#13;
only about 4% of couples practice family planning0&#13;
4o62      In some African countries, FPAs also work through cther kinds of&#13;
organizations--in schools, women's and youth groups, churches, agricultural&#13;
organizations, etco--to introduce family planning services and information,&#13;
again usually on a limited scale but with some promising indications of&#13;
growing interesto&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

(c) Family Planning Associations in Asia&#13;
4.63      In Asia, the national family planning associations work to&#13;
strengthen official commitment to population policies and family planning&#13;
programs, build public support, develop better ways of delivering services,&#13;
and extend services to hard to reach groups and areas. Thus they support&#13;
the major government programs, choosing their efforts to complement those&#13;
programs most effectively.&#13;
4.64      In Bangladesh, the FPA promotes broader support for family&#13;
planning, develops effective models for delivering services, especially via&#13;
outreach in urban areas, develops more effective strategies for reaching&#13;
youth, promotes private organizations' interest in family planning, and&#13;
demonstrates replicable integrated projects involving other welfare&#13;
organizations working especially with youth, women and religious groups.&#13;
4.65      In India, the FPA helps increase public understanding of and&#13;
support for family planning, strengthen government programs of voluntary&#13;
family planning, test community-based distribution programs, work with&#13;
other local agencies in integrated projects, and develop the role of&#13;
volunteer agencies. In its Karnataka Project--covering 300,000 people--the&#13;
FPAI operated a community-based distribution program that the communities&#13;
though poor, supported heavily. In the Varanasi Project, the FPIA&#13;
cooperates with the government primary health centers and Benares&#13;
University in a pilot primary health care projects for 400,000 people now&#13;
being extended to the District's 2.8 million rural people. Traditional&#13;
healers, community health centers, and auxfliary nurses provide the&#13;
outreach and women are trained in income generating skills. Communities&#13;
are assuming increasing financial responsibility for this project. Similar&#13;
integrated community-based projects are underway in several other locations&#13;
show greater acceptability than normal government programs.&#13;
4.66      In Indonesia the FPA pioneers approaches for hard-to-reach groups&#13;
such as youths and dropouts, provides sterilization (with some AVS assist-&#13;
ance) in 31 districts, experiments with community-based distribution, and&#13;
supports a major youth program. In 11 areas it helps raise poor women's&#13;
status through income generation while providing family planning.&#13;
4.67      In Thailand, the FPA builds public support and cooperates with&#13;
other private organizations to extend service delivery in hard to reach&#13;
areas including the Northeast (especially the refugee areas).&#13;
2. FPIA&#13;
4.68      Family Planning International Assistance is an arm of the U.S.&#13;
IPPF affiliate, established more than a decade ago. Since 1971, it has&#13;
provided almost $86 million in population assistance. Its annual program,&#13;
recently about $16 million, serves some 900,000 family planning clients in&#13;
over 40 countries at a cost averaging roughly $7 per year (higher in&#13;
Africa) and provides other contraceptives and medical supplies to govern-&#13;
ments. FPIA is funded largely by USAID. It too has a substantial backlog&#13;
of projects awaiting funds and could increase its program by half within a&#13;
year.&#13;

4.69      FPIA helps introduce family planning services and information in&#13;
innovative ways through non-governmental organizations--church groups and&#13;
hospitals, women's groups, youth groups, trade unions, etco Sometimes&#13;
it also assists government programs. FPIA works in tough places--where&#13;
poverty, geography, culture or politics particularly inhibit family plan-&#13;
ning. Its efforts, though usually small-scale, often provide real guidance&#13;
for nascent government programs as official and public attitudes in such&#13;
places begin to thaw. Indeed FPIA's success helps foster change0&#13;
4.70      FPIA's hallmark is the modest program showing that family plan-&#13;
ning and basic maternal and child health care can be provided through&#13;
community-based outreach at an affordable cost even in poor areas. But in&#13;
Mexico, Brazil, the Philippines and a few other places, FPIA's programs&#13;
have made a demographic difference0&#13;
FPIA assists with:&#13;
--   contraceptive services perhaps with broader health or family&#13;
welfare services;&#13;
--   training;&#13;
--   information and education on family planning and responsible&#13;
parenthoodo&#13;
4.71      About half of FPIA's assistance is for "projects" and about half&#13;
for "commodities." Its project assistance covers technical advice and a&#13;
variety of resource needs0 Commodity assistance covers contraceptives,&#13;
equipment, and other supplies necessary to implement family planning&#13;
programs0 Much of the commodity assistance goes to government programs&#13;
requiring no technical or other assistance0&#13;
Geographic Distribution of Assistance&#13;
4.72      FPIA's leading region ls Latin America, which receives over a&#13;
third of commodity, project and total resources0 East Asia accounts for&#13;
about a fourth of total resources (more of commodities), South West Asia&#13;
about a fifth (and more of commodities), and Africa about 13% of commodity,&#13;
project, and total resources0 (Interregional programs account for the&#13;
remaining 5% of project resources0) FPIA's top five countries are Mexico at&#13;
$19.2 million (22%), Philippines at $9.7 million (11%), Bangladesh at $9.1&#13;
million (11%), Thailand at $6.3 million (7%), and Indonesia at $408 million&#13;
(6%)o Over 1971-1982, these five countries together accounted for about&#13;
half non-commodity resources, two-thirds of commodity resources, and over&#13;
half of combined resources0 Brazil also receives substantial project&#13;
assistance.&#13;
4.73      FPIA has shifted toward Africa and away from Asia and inter-&#13;
regional programs but still respornds to major opportunities in Latin&#13;
America. In 1981 about 45% of FPIA's total resources went to Latin America&#13;
and the Caribbean, the largest region since 19780 East Asia ranked second&#13;
at 20% in 1981, down from its historic level of about 27%. Interestingly&#13;
Africa ranked third in 1981 at 18%, up sharply from its historic level of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 103 -&#13;
13%.  South West Asia ranked fourth in 1981 at 15%, down slightly from its&#13;
historic level of 18%.&#13;
4.74       Secular non-government organizations generally account for about&#13;
half of all FPIA projects. But FPIA leads in supporting private religious&#13;
organizations interested in family planning, though their share of projects&#13;
has dropped from 38% of all projects ever active to 30% of projects active&#13;
in June, 1982. Some 15% of its active projects in 1982 were with host&#13;
country governments, compared to 10% for all projects ever active. About&#13;
half of FPIA's projects have been based jointly in urban and rural areas,&#13;
one-fifth primarily in urban (up more recently), and one-third primarily in&#13;
rural. Ninety percent of its projects focus on family planning services&#13;
primarily, 7% on information primarily, and 3% on training primarily. Most&#13;
"family planning" projects offer family planning in conjunction with&#13;
maternal and child health, and almost all do in Africa.&#13;
4.75       FPIA has substantially assisted family planning in Mexico,&#13;
furnishing contraceptives to the government's rural primary health care&#13;
program and assisting private urban programs of maternal and child health&#13;
care and family planning that are now models outside as well as inside&#13;
Mexico. In Brazil, FPIA is helping the vigorous national family planning&#13;
association, BEMFAM, establish family planning in the state of Rio. In&#13;
Indonesia, FPIA is helping bring family planning to the remote outer&#13;
islands (through an indigenous Muslim organization), to introduce&#13;
sterilization, and to begin reaching youth more effectively. In&#13;
Bangladesh, FPIA supports some promising projects, with women's&#13;
organizations providing family planning door-to-door in the slums of Dacca&#13;
and Chittagong. In programs areas about a fifth of fertile-age women now&#13;
practice family planning. Some of FPIA's most intriguing projects are in&#13;
Africa. In Kenya several outreach programs serving disparate areas now&#13;
report over a fifth of fertile-age couples practicing family planning; in&#13;
Liberia FPIA is training family planning workers for a new primary health&#13;
care program the government is establishing.    Such programs are not easy to&#13;
run and costs are not as low as in Asia or Latin America, raising concerns&#13;
for replicability. But they do show family planning services will not go&#13;
unused.&#13;
4.76       In Kenya, FPIA has assisted the Chogoria hospital in providing&#13;
community-based outreach, linked to the health system, in an area of&#13;
roughly 200,000 people. (Both Sweden and the United Kingdom have also&#13;
assisted this project.) A system of satellite clinics and distribution&#13;
posts bring primary health care to within 2.5 miles of every major&#13;
population center, outstanding coverage for Africa. Communities have built&#13;
and maintained their own clinics. Outreach workers from the communities&#13;
visit homes, identify women who wish to practice family planning, and help&#13;
them obtain services (resupplying pills at home). Over one-fifth of&#13;
eligible women in the whole area are practicing family planning, the&#13;
highest level in Kenya. (About 75% choose the pill.) Costs are difficult&#13;
to estimate for family planning only, since much primary health care is&#13;
also included. The cost per capita population is roughly $2.00, the cost&#13;
per family planning user perhaps ten times that--reflecting the greater&#13;
difficulty of organizing and extending services in Africa and the still&#13;
limited demand for services. Similar FPIA projects are underway in two&#13;
in Nigeria and the Sudan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 104 &#13;
4.77      In Bangladesh, FPIA has assisted a well-known project run&#13;
entirely by women--the Concerned Women for Family Planning--an unusual&#13;
story in that country. CWFP started in the 1974 famine and scon became&#13;
convinced that women of the urban slums needed and wanted fami.y planning&#13;
but could not get services as their poverty and highly conservative muslim&#13;
traditions confined them to their one-room homes. But other wyomen, still&#13;
Muslim but less restricted, could reach out to them0    So, In X976, CUFP&#13;
began providing house-to-house family planning services (pullb and condoms)&#13;
and advice and referral for maternal and child health problems, reaching&#13;
into the poorest slums of Dacca to ten other citieso It serves only 60,000&#13;
users, but in the neighborhoods it covers, a substantial fraction of women&#13;
do want these services. The implied annual cost per active us~er is about&#13;
$6.00.&#13;
3. PATHFINDER&#13;
4.78      The Pathfinder Fund, an American foundation established in 1957,&#13;
encourages highly innovative approaches to foster family planning and&#13;
ultimately reduce population growtho Since 1970, it has provided almost&#13;
$63 million in assistance in some 55 countrieso0 Pathfinder's 1981 annual&#13;
program level was about $4.7 million; the 1982 level was about $7 million0&#13;
Pathfinder receives over 80% of its funding from USAID and most of the rest&#13;
from private sources0&#13;
4.79      Pathfinder is particularly known for its willingneso to innovate,&#13;
its flexibility, and its cooperative spirit0 Usually, Pathfinder makes&#13;
relatively small grants for "pathfindlng" activities that governments or&#13;
other major institutions may be leery of trying but willing t:o replicate&#13;
once tested0 It seeks developing country organizations such as family&#13;
planning associations, women's organizations, or community groups ready to&#13;
act but needing help to get started0 Pathfinder, like other private family&#13;
planning organizations, has had to shelve projects for lack of funds&#13;
recently.&#13;
4080      Pathfinder tries to root actual service delivery in communities&#13;
so that the broadest layer of service gets managed locally0 It thus&#13;
strengthens the tradition of "community-based service" that private&#13;
organizations and a few governments have helped buildo&#13;
4.81      Pathfinder's early exploratory efforts helped establish&#13;
government services and IPPF affiliates in a number of countriÂ°s in Asia,&#13;
Africa and Latin America0 In 1976, reflecting growing intersot in how&#13;
development affects family planning practice, Pathfinder bro&amp;dened its&#13;
efforts0 It now supports projects in three main functional categories.&#13;
Fertility services, women's programs, and population policy. In 1981/82,&#13;
of its $4o7 million expenditures in S981/82 allocable by function, over&#13;
$2.9 million or almost two-thirds went for fertility services.12/&#13;

Program Activity by Region&#13;
4.82       Pathfinder has some 88 projects active at present, including 15&#13;
in Africa, 36 in Latin America, 28 in Asia, and 9 non-regional. Pathfinder&#13;
also makes commodity grants, some 132 recently, including 43 in Africa, 73&#13;
in Latin America, and 16 in Asia. Over the past four years its geogra-&#13;
phical allocations have also fluctuated considerably as Pathfinder has&#13;
tried particularly to respond to opportunities in Africa and the Middle&#13;
East, which have developed erratically. On balance about one-fourth of its&#13;
resources have gone to Africa and the Middle East, about half to Latin&#13;
America, about one-fifth to Asia, and less than one-tenth to non-regional&#13;
programmes.&#13;
4.83      In Africa Pathfinder's efforts remain modest.    Programs are often&#13;
difficult to organize, and results are limited. But in Kenya, Pathfinder&#13;
is assisting Maendeleo Ya Wanawake, the largest national women's organiza-&#13;
tion (with a thirty year history and some 200,000 members from all over&#13;
Kenya). Maendeleo groups organize grassroots self-help projects to raise&#13;
income and improve living conditions and is pioneering a family planning&#13;
education program to reach 960 community leaders and 3000 local groups and&#13;
community-based family planning program in two communities. Like many&#13;
organizations in poorer countries, this project has not always run&#13;
smoothly, but in Kenya as in Mexico or Bangladesh, women are beginning to&#13;
organize to obtain family planning for themselves.&#13;
4.84      In Latin America, Pathfinder has helped establish and extend&#13;
community-based family planning outreach services for people living in poor&#13;
and often rural areas, working with several outstanding national family&#13;
planning associations, women's organizations, drugstores, and other private&#13;
channels. Several major Pathfinder projects assist national family&#13;
planning associations in reaching into new areas--generally the poorer or&#13;
more remote regions lacking other sources of regular service.&#13;
--   In Brazil, Pathfinder assists BEMFAM's effort to establish&#13;
services in four of Brazil's impoverished Northeastern States,&#13;
Pernambuco and Alagoas, Piaui and Ceara.&#13;
--   In Colombia, Pathfinder has assisted a PROFAMILIA project to&#13;
extend community-based services in rural areas of seven Colombian&#13;
Departments. This established program now covers 80% of the&#13;
population or some 3.2 million people, including about 450,000&#13;
women of reproductive age in union. PROFAMILIA's annual cost per&#13;
user was about $2.30, down from $7.3 reported for 1978/79.&#13;
PROFAMILIA's cost per user in urban areas is only $1.40, though&#13;
BEMFAM in Brazil reports over $6 and ASHONPLAFA in Honduras over&#13;
$8 for its Pathfinder-assisted efforts.13/ This program has&#13;
become self-financing.&#13;
--   Pathfinder is also helping PROFAMILIA bring family planning to&#13;
the 700,000 poor and often neglected people scattered across&#13;
600,000 square kilometers of Colombia's vast outback--plains and&#13;

Amazonian jungles, penetrable only by air for several months&#13;
annually. Some 115 distribution posts have been established and&#13;
now sell pills, condoms, and other barrier methods; some 15,000&#13;
women use pills and at least 1000 other methods to about 15% of&#13;
women of fertile age in union.14/&#13;
4.85      In Bangladesh, Pathfinder and other private organizations have&#13;
concentrated on urban areas which include 10% of the population, over 9&#13;
million people or perhaps 1.5 million eligible couples. Pathfinder has&#13;
11 projects providing roughly one million people in poor and sometimes&#13;
remote areas with community-based family planning services (in&#13;
collaboration with various local institutions including the health&#13;
ministry, local governments, and employers' organizations). Networks of&#13;
fieldworkers backed by supervisory personnel and some clinical facilities&#13;
usually provide house-to-house distribution of contraceptives. (Pills are&#13;
the most popular method). They refer clients for sterilization, IUDs,&#13;
etc. By stressing close personal contact to provide reassurance,&#13;
reinforcement, and convenient resupply, these projects have achieved&#13;
startling increases in family planning practice in areas of severe poverty&#13;
and highly conservative culture.15/&#13;
4.86      Before programs got underway, only 5%-20% of eligible couples&#13;
practiced family planning, averaging less than 10%. After several years of&#13;
operation, the Pathfinder projects report over half, on average, of&#13;
eligible couples using one of the five methods of family planning. In some&#13;
areas, over two-thirds of couples practice family planning. Moreover,&#13;
Pathfinder reports an annual cost per user of about $4.40--low compared to&#13;
some community-based distribution programs in other difficult&#13;
circumstances. The cost per capita population is about 30 cents, the&#13;
government program costs roughly 50 cents per capita population and over&#13;
$20 per active user per annum.16/&#13;
4. Association for Voluntary Sterilization&#13;
4.87      The Association for Voluntary Sterilization, AVS, was established&#13;
in 1971 to make voluntary surgical contraception available as a realistic&#13;
option world-wide, particularly by incorporating it as a regular part of&#13;
national health and family planning programs. Its annual program of about&#13;
$10 million in 1982 included some $8 million in assistance for voluntary&#13;
sterilization programs or related efforts in some 29 countries, where it&#13;
has encouraged establishment of National Associations for Voluntary&#13;
Sterilization. AVS, which is supported largely by USAID, provides tech-&#13;
nical assistance, equipment, and other support on a grant basis to institu-&#13;
tions in the developing world. The best developed public or private&#13;
programs for voluntary sterilization are in Asia and Central America, where&#13;
considerable availability now exists. There, AVS helps meet the needs of&#13;

national programs, for example in Bangladesh, and carries out extensive&#13;
private programs as well, e.g., Bangladesh, Thailand, Nepal and Indonesia,&#13;
Guatemala, and Honduras. In much of Latin America, and North Agrica,&#13;
voluntary sterilization is expanding, and AVS-supported projects help build&#13;
official interest and public support by showing that voluntary steriliza-&#13;
tion is wanted, safe, and effective. AVS is assisting some government&#13;
programs, e.g., in Ronduras and Mexico, and many substantial private&#13;
programs, e.g. in Colombia, Jamaica, Honduras, Mexico and Braz.l0    In most&#13;
of Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, the first pilot or demonstration&#13;
projects are now being introduced gradually and flexibly as interest and&#13;
culture indicate. But AVS has assisted small projects in Nigeria, Sierra&#13;
Leone, Tanzania, and Zaire, among others. And it has provided substantial&#13;
assistance to Tunisia0 On the whole, about 45% of AVS funds go to Latin&#13;
America, almost 40% to Asia, and about 15% to Africa and the Wear East&#13;
(1976-82). In 1982 the leading grantees were the Bangladesh Association&#13;
for Voluntary Sterilization (almost $900,000), Thailand's Population and&#13;
Community Development Association (about $400,000), Tunisia's National&#13;
Office for Family Planning and Population (over $400,000), Guatemala's&#13;
National Family Planning Association (almost $600,000), Colombia's (almost&#13;
$400,000), Dominican Republic's (almost $400,000), and Honduras' (over&#13;
$300,000) 0&#13;
4088      AVS is devoted to ensuing that sterilization is entirely&#13;
voluntary, that people give truly informed ccnsent, and that procedures are&#13;
carried out safely and effectively0 Thus AVS serves as a leading interna-&#13;
tional source of advice on simpler and safer techniques of sterilization&#13;
(particularly minilaparotomy for female sterilization and vasectomy),&#13;
associated anaesthesia (where it has favored non-general anaesthesia on&#13;
grounds of reduced risks), and post-operative care, and informed consent0&#13;
The programs it supports privately have often became models foT more&#13;
extensive public programs; and it strengthens public programs by providing&#13;
training, equipment and technical assistance0 It has also advised on the&#13;
sensitive issue of what constitutes appropriate compensation for service&#13;
providers or for clients (who may have not extra clothes or whno may have to&#13;
walk long distances) and the broader issue of incentives and their&#13;
attendant benefits and concerns0&#13;
4.89      This "model" role is evident in Bangladesh0    The Bangladesh&#13;
Association for Voluntary Sterilization is the most active, with about 30&#13;
service centers accounting for about one-fifth of all sterilizEtions done&#13;
thus far in Bangladesh0 AVS has supported BAVS in its owni programs to&#13;
strengthen quality of care, counseling strategies to ensure ina:ormed&#13;
consent, and public information efforts0 BAVS has also helped strengthen&#13;
the government's program of voluntary sterilization, initiating medical&#13;
workshops to help improve and maintain quality medical standares0 It has&#13;
also advised the government on structuring and developing the national&#13;
program to ensure voluntary consent017/&#13;
4.90      Recognizing the role of men in family planning and appreciating&#13;
the professional health community's relative in attention to ale&#13;
sterilization, in 1982 AVS launched an initiative to encourage new&#13;

vasectomy programs in the developing world. Eleven countries have already&#13;
submitted proposals, exceeding available resources. Brazil's capitalize&#13;
Project in Sao Paolo--Brazil's first vasectomy-only project--is becoming a&#13;
national center for training, research, and information, although Brazil&#13;
has no federally supported family planning activities. In Thailand a&#13;
project of the Population and Community Development Association to serve&#13;
rural males, using village-based family planning workers and extensive&#13;
media, served more vasectomy acceptors in five days than in the entire&#13;
preceding year.&#13;
5. Population Council&#13;
4.91      The Population Council, established in 1952, is an international&#13;
scientific and professional organization. It focuses on:&#13;
--   human reproductive biomedicine to improve and extend contracep-&#13;
tive methods;&#13;
--   social science affecting public policy bearing on population&#13;
growth (and its causes and consequences), health, and family&#13;
planning;&#13;
--   publications for researchers, policy-makers, and the public;&#13;
--   training; and&#13;
--   technical assistance, operation research,   and institution-build-&#13;
ing in population programs the third world.&#13;
4.92      Over the years the Council has emerged as a leading source of&#13;
professional advice and technical assistance for several donors (certainly&#13;
USAID) and for major channel organizations (some of which contribute to its&#13;
support) as well as several developing countries. The Council has&#13;
pioneered in contraceptive technology (e.g., in female and more recently&#13;
male sterilization, the "copper T" IUD, and new hormonal implants). It has&#13;
supported operations research and given technical assistance to family&#13;
planning programs in widely distributed countries. It has influenced&#13;
world-wide population policy development as described in the next chapter.&#13;
And it has assisted developing countries of every region through a wide-&#13;
spread network of field staff.   The Council's current annual program is&#13;
about $17 million. Its funding is international though substantially from&#13;
the United States. Other contributors include the governments of&#13;
Australia, Canada, Norway and the Netherlands, and UNFPA. Of its annual&#13;
program expenses, of about $14.5 million, some $6 million (about two-&#13;
fifths) went for biomedical research, almost $3 million (one-fifth) for&#13;
policy studies, almost $5 million (about one-third) for international&#13;
programs, and about $600,000 for communications.&#13;
C. Bilateral Population Assistance&#13;
4.93      "Bilateral" assistance can mean any official development&#13;
assistance not channeled through multilateral institutions such as the&#13;
United Nations or the Multilateral Development Banks, or only that portion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 110 -&#13;
going government-to-government, or something in between0 Most donors&#13;
provide limited bilateral population assistance in the government-to-&#13;
government sense.   Using 1981 expenditures data collected by UnlFPA and&#13;
their definition of "bilateral" (which is somewhere between the two&#13;
concepts above), the United States provided over two-thirds of the total-&#13;
$105 million of $139 million--followed by Norway with almost $10 million,&#13;
and Germany at about $7 million. On average, bilateral assistance thus&#13;
defined constituted over one-third of the total, though individual&#13;
performance ranges widely and varies over time. (Sweden's bilateral&#13;
emphasis has declined; Germany has increased0) (The United States shows&#13;
about half, but currently closer to one-third goes strictly government-to-&#13;
government0)&#13;

4.94      Governments sometimes prefer to provide bilateral assistance&#13;
to other governments because they seek identification with their onm&#13;
resources, because they want to support activities beyond what is happening&#13;
through multilateral or multidonor efforts, or because they think they can&#13;
increase effectiveness by funding some discrete activity, ever. if part of a&#13;
broader whole program supported by several donors0 Many donors generally&#13;
focus bilateral assistance on countries or regions of particular political,&#13;
economic or strategic importance to them--e0go, the United Kingdom in with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11; --&#13;
Commonwealth countries; Sweden in the past in several countries with&#13;
socialist leanings; Japan in East Asia; the United States in its Asian&#13;
allies, Egypt, parts of Africa, and parts of Latin America and the&#13;
Caribbean. Nonetheless most also seek to focus assistance on poorer&#13;
countries. Many seek to concentrate population assistance in just a few&#13;
countries, in hope of greater impact. Thus the handful of countries pro-&#13;
viding bilateral population assistance tend to be active in the handful&#13;
politically willing to receive it and programmatically able to use it. As&#13;
table 4.24 below suggests, almost all major bilateral donors are or have&#13;
recently been active in Bangladesh; several in India; the USA, Japan and UK&#13;
in Indonesia; the USA, Nordic countries, and UK in Kenya; and USA and&#13;
Nordic countries in Tanzania; and most except Germany in Thailand. Some&#13;
smaller donors, e.g. Australia, Canada and Denmark concentrate their&#13;
population assistance on only two or three countries.&#13;
4.95       In terms of functional breakdowns of bilateral assistance, the&#13;
main source of information is a 1977 study of the OECD (published 1979).&#13;
Almost three-fourths of all bilateral assistance went for family planning,&#13;
with demographics and related policy efforts accounting for another tenth.&#13;
(More data are available on USAID.)&#13;
4.96      The following sections describe major donors' bilateral assist-&#13;
ance. Because "bilateral" can be interpreted in several ways, the descrip-&#13;
tion includes the total population assistance program and its major compo-&#13;
nents. Most countries channel the bulk of their population assistance&#13;
through UNFPA, IPPF, and more recently, WHO's Special Programme for&#13;
Research in Human Reproduction, leaving relatively little for "bilateral&#13;
efforts" except for the United States. Data are from UNFPA.18/&#13;
United States&#13;
4.97       The United States contributes more bilaterally than all other&#13;
donors (and also has a relatively high share for bilateral assistance),&#13;
though it is also the leading contributor to UNFPA and IPPF. USAID&#13;
allocated its population assistance of about $211 million recently (on a&#13;
commitments basis) to four main types of programs:&#13;
--   UNFPA (about $33-35 million annually or 17% of U.S. population&#13;
assistance in recent years);&#13;
--   the four major private organizations (IPPF, FPIA, Pathfinder, and&#13;
AVS)--over $40 million or about one-fifth of the total recently;&#13;
--   other private organizations, most based in the United States but&#13;
collaborating with developing country institutions, for&#13;
population policy planning, demography, biomedical and operations&#13;

research, information and education and training--roughly $50&#13;
million or about one-fourth of the total;&#13;
--   and the rest---roughly $80 million or over one-third of the&#13;
total--to government-to-government program.&#13;
4.98      Two-thirds of the U.S. government-to-government bilateral program&#13;
assistance goes largely to Asia (about one-fourth of the total USAID&#13;
program.)19/ Major recipients are Indonesia (program level exceeding $12&#13;
million in 1979), Bangladesh ($9 million), Philippines ($9 milliion), and&#13;
more recently India, with annual programs exceeding $1 million also going&#13;
to Nepal, Rwanda, Tanzania, Kenya, Thailand, Morocco, Tunisia and Haiti in&#13;
Thailand, Tanzania, Kenya, Thailand, Morocco, Tutiisia, and Haiti in recent&#13;
years. (Egypt also receives substantial funding through Economic Support&#13;
Funds rather than Development Assistance.)&#13;
4.99      In supporting these country-to-country programs, the United&#13;
States often participates in or cooperates with multidonor efforts led by&#13;
UNFPA or the World Bank, but it prepares its own projects separately to&#13;
focus on particular objectives. Thus in India USAID is providing support&#13;
for the government's efforts to extend primary health care including family&#13;
planning in five states including Gujarat and Maharashtra, while UNFPA, the&#13;
Bank, the United Kingdom and other donors work in other states. In Indo-&#13;
nesia USAID has heavily supported outreach programs providing family plan-&#13;
ning at the village level, funding procurement of contraceptives, training,&#13;
information, evaluation, etc. Such programs link to the health infra-&#13;
structure, but USAID attempts not to use population funds for construction&#13;
of health facilities except where essential (and where other donors do&#13;
not). In Bangladesh, the Philippines, and Thailand USAID has funded&#13;
similar outreach efforts and also supported programs to provide voluntary&#13;
sterilizations (both male and female). Where funding for primary health&#13;
care including family planning is called for, USAID tries to combine&#13;
-"health" and "population" accounts in appropriate proportion that the focus&#13;
of its population funds is in fact on population and family planning.&#13;
4.100     The one-fourth of USAID's population program channeled through&#13;
private organizations other than the four largest ones has also been&#13;
innovative. These funds support:&#13;
--   biomedical and operations research which has achieved world wide&#13;
recognition in developing safer and more effective contraceptives&#13;
and sterilization techniques and cheaper and more appealing ways&#13;
of delivering basic family planning and health care, specifically&#13;
through community based active outreach.&#13;

--   worldwide programs to improve training for family planning&#13;
services, extend information and education programs;&#13;
--   world-wide programs to support population policy development.&#13;
4.101     On balance, the United States has used its bilateral population&#13;
assistance to respond to countries wishing to extend service widely--and&#13;
emphasizing actual service extension--and to develop innovative ways of&#13;
making services and information available, particularly through outreach.&#13;
It has provided major assistance to improve variety and safety of contra-&#13;
ceptive techniques, and it is the main source of some contraceptive&#13;
supplies (e.g., pills), and sterilization technology. It is also a leading&#13;
source of research on effective service delivery. And it led in establish-&#13;
ing the World Fertility Survey and other measures to show the need for and&#13;
benefits of family planning. It has also helped elucidate development&#13;
population linkages. It is active in almost all countries receiving&#13;
substantial population assistance bilaterally.&#13;
4.102     About 90% of U.S. population assistance is grants; the annual&#13;
loan level now exceeds $20 million. India, Indonesia, and the Philippines&#13;
have received loans.&#13;
Canada&#13;
4.103     The government of Canada began providing population assistance in&#13;
1970 after new laws permitted dissemination of family planning services and&#13;
information in Canada. Canada supports all major fields of population&#13;
assistance including those directed at improving women's opportunities.&#13;
It supports family planning particularly as part of primary health care.&#13;
It focuses its bilateral assistance in Asia. In 1982, the government of&#13;
Canada provided about $12 million in population assistance, including about&#13;
$7 million to UNFPA, under $4 million to IPPF, and bilateral support to&#13;
Bangladesh and Thailand in collaboration with the World Bank. (The Thai&#13;
project involves contraceptive procurement and research.)&#13;
Denmark&#13;
4.104     Danish population assistance goes primarily through multilateral&#13;
channels to all types of population activities. In 1982, the government of&#13;
Denmark provided about $8 million in population assistance, including over&#13;
$4 million to UNFPA, over $1 million to IPPF, some $800,000 to WHO's&#13;
Special Programme in Human Reproduction, and bilateral assistance in&#13;
collaboration with UNFPA to Bangladesh and India.&#13;
Finland&#13;
4.105     The government of Finland has provided population assistance&#13;
since 1969 through multilateral and bilateral channels. In 1982, the&#13;
government of Finland provided roughly $1 million annually in population&#13;
assistance, largely to UNFPA with modest contributions to IPPF, WHO's&#13;
Special Programme, and limited bilateral efforts recently in such countries&#13;
as Egypt, Kenya, Sri Lanka, and Tanzania.&#13;
&#13;

Federal Republic of Germany&#13;
4.106     Germany has provided population assistance since 1969 and has&#13;
increased assistance sharply since that time, though levels have&#13;
declined in absolute dollar terms and as a fraction of all German assist-&#13;
ance recently. Germany supports a range of population activ!t:es and&#13;
provides substantial bilateral as wsell as multilateral assistance0&#13;
Bilateral aid has gone to countries in several regions of the third tsorldo&#13;
In 1982, Germany provided roughly $22 million in population ass&amp;istance&#13;
including some $13 million to UNFPA, over $2 million to IPPF and substan-&#13;
tial bilateral assistance to Bangladesh and Egypt. Germany has joined Â¢lth&#13;
other donors to assist Bangladesh in establishing a comprehenslve family&#13;
planning program. Germany has particularly helped provide infrastructure&#13;
and training for 3700 women family planning "advisers" or outreach&#13;
workers. Germany is also assisting development of primary health care&#13;
including family planning in an area of one million people, providing&#13;
assistance in several fields. In Egypt, Germany is providing cli'nical&#13;
assistance for development of family planning services.&#13;
Japan&#13;
4.107     Japan has provided population assistance since 1969 and has&#13;
increased its assistance sharply in absolute levels and as a share of ODA&#13;
(now exceeding 1%)o It is now the second largest donor0 Japan supports a&#13;
wide range of activities (excluding abortion) and distributes most of its&#13;
population multilaterally, largely through UNFPA and IPPFo Some 4% of the&#13;
Japanese contribution to UNFPA and IPPF is then transferred to the Japanese&#13;
Organization for International Cooperation in Family Planning (JOICFP), a&#13;
private organization cooperating with the Japanese governmento In 1982, the&#13;
government of Japan provided about $43 million in population assistance0&#13;
This includes over $24 million to UNFPA, $9 million to IPPF, and&#13;
substantial bilateral assistance particularly in Bangladesh, Indonesia, the&#13;
Philippines, and Thailand (reflecting interest in Asia)o    In Irdonesia,&#13;
Japan has provided moderate assistance for over a decade for family&#13;
planning media production, in the Philippines and Bangladesh it has also&#13;
provided moderate assistance for several years for information, education,&#13;
vehicles and contraceptives0 (Bangladesh received under $400,000 in 1982,&#13;
the Philippines just under $500,000.) And in Thailand, Japan has also&#13;
provided moderate assistance for several years for information, education,&#13;
vehicles, and information (the funding pattern is thus similar for most&#13;
country-to-country programs)0 The Japanese Organization for International&#13;
Cooperation in Family Planning (JOICFP) is wforking with UNFPA and IPPF to&#13;
extend integrated family planning, nutrition and parasite control, in&#13;
Bangladesh, Indonesia, India, the Philippines, Nexico, Brazil and&#13;
Colombia.&#13;
The Netherlands&#13;
4.108     In 1982, the Netherlands provided about $13 million iTn population&#13;
assistance, exclusively through UNFPA and IPPF (having phased out earlier&#13;
bilateral assistance)0 In cooperation with UNFPA, the Netherlands&#13;
particularly assists NTepal and Bangladesho&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 115 -&#13;
Norway&#13;
4.109     The government of Norway has long been a principal source of&#13;
population assistance. In 1971, the Norwegian government decided to&#13;
aim at allocating about one-tenth of Norwegian development assistance to&#13;
population and maternal and child health and now provides the highest&#13;
percentage of any donor. Norway supports broad range of activities,&#13;
particularly infrastructure for health and family planning and personnel&#13;
training--for rural areas where possible. Other activities, including some&#13;
to improve women's opportunities, are also supported. About four-fifths&#13;
of Norwegian population assistance goes through multilateral channels&#13;
(especially UNFPA and IPPF). Bilateral and is also substantial. While&#13;
most bilateral Norwegia.. assistance goes to a few countries with which&#13;
Norway has cooperation agreements, population assistance is less&#13;
restricted. Norway provided about $25 million in population assistance in&#13;
1982. This included about $14 million for UNFPA, over $3 million for IPPF,&#13;
about $2 million for WHO's Special Programme, and a multi-bi agreement of&#13;
over $1 million with UNFPA to support Needs Assessments and other&#13;
programmes. It has recently provided major assistance to Bangladesh and&#13;
India, large scale assistance to Kenya and Thailand, and some assistance to&#13;
several other countries including Peru, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Jamaica, Tanzania&#13;
and Botswana. In Bangladesh, Norway has participated in the World Bank-led&#13;
multidonor project, making total commitments of about $17.5 million,&#13;
particularly to establish over 200 Union Welfare Centers (one-fourth of the&#13;
total) and training facilities for outreach workers. In Kenya, Norway has&#13;
also contributed to health training. In India, Norway is assisting the All&#13;
India Post-Partum Programme in a project of over $30 million over&#13;
1971-1983. In Thailand, Norway is participating in a World Bank programme,&#13;
and in Peru, Jamaica, Nepal, and Sri Lanka in cooperation with UNFPA&#13;
programs often by providing training for field workers.&#13;
Sweden&#13;
4.110     In 1958, Sweden provided the first population assistance to the&#13;
third world, with a donation to a Sri Lankan family planning project.&#13;
Sweden has been a staunch supporter of population assistance ever since.&#13;
It now ranks fourth among population donors--but second only to Norway in&#13;
population assistance per capita. Swedish population assistance has&#13;
recently declined from 4.6% of ODA in 1977 to 3.4% in 1981, but this is&#13;
still about twice the average level. Sweden requires that the population&#13;
programs it assists be part of broader social development efforts and&#13;
particularly urges integration of family planning and maternal and child&#13;
health. It also emphasizes the need for a broad range of family planning&#13;
methods and is concerned about the issue of voluntarism.    Sweden provides&#13;
most of its population multilaterally (especially to IPPF and UNFPA).    The&#13;
government of Sweden provided about $23 million in 1982.    This included&#13;
about $7 million for UNFPA, about $7 million to IPPF, and over $4 million&#13;
to the WHO Special Programme. Sweden has recently given substantial&#13;
bilateral assistance particularly to Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, and&#13;
Kenya. Its bilateral program is now limited to Bangladesh and Kenya. In&#13;
Bangladesh, Sweden is cooperating in the World Bank-led multidonor project,&#13;
providing over $10 million in recent years. In India Sweden contributed&#13;
over $10 million to support the first World Bank-led multidonor project to&#13;
extend primary health care including family planning particularly in Uttar&#13;

United Kingdom&#13;
40111     The United Kingdom has provided population assistance since 1964&#13;
and continues to do so, though population assistance has decl'fned in abso-&#13;
lute dollar terms and as a share of total ODA, The United Kingdom empha-&#13;
sizes the need to slow population growth as a wasy to facilitate development&#13;
progress and to improve health, and it considers population assistance part&#13;
of a broader policy to address basic needs particularly in poorer coun-&#13;
tries. About three-fourths of its population assistance goes through&#13;
multilateral channels, but it provides some bilateral assistance to&#13;
governments and to private organizations such as Save The Children, Oxfam,&#13;
and churches. It supports a wide range of actlvities, basically in all the&#13;
U.N. categories of population assistance. Its overall 1982 pcpulation&#13;
assistance level is estimated at about $20 million. This includes almost&#13;
$5 million for UNFPA (since 1968 about $42 million), about $5 million for&#13;
IPPF (over $30 million since 1967) and about $4. milion to WL-O's Special&#13;
Programme in Human Reproduction (over $11 million since 1976)o The United&#13;
Kingdom has provided considerable leadership ln research (especially on&#13;
safety of oral contraceptives, but also on causes of fertility change) and&#13;
development of information on family planning methods. The 1981 funding&#13;
level for such activities was roughly $500,000o Its principal bilateral&#13;
effort recently is a $32 million project (1980--85) to assist the Government&#13;
of India in strengthening the rural haalth and family w^elfare delivery&#13;
systems in the State of Orissa0 This involves a comprehensive primary&#13;
health care approach related information, and associated efforts in&#13;
nutrition and educationo The British government has also provided&#13;
assistance to India for female sterilization0 It has also participated&#13;
incooperation with multi-donor projects led by World Bank or UNFPA in&#13;
Bangladesh (again for sterilization services), and Egypt, and provided&#13;
assistance to such countries as Botswana (again MCH/FP training), Sudan&#13;
(fertility survey), Sri Lanka (training MCH/FP), Singapore (research on&#13;
oral contraceptives), and the Philippines (family planning in one&#13;
area)0&#13;
D. Summarizing Patterns of Population Assistance&#13;
4_112     Looking at patterns of assistance by donor for twenty large&#13;
population countries, several themes emerge0&#13;
4.113     First, UNFPA is active _n every country0   Most have had or are&#13;
undertaking Needs Assessments. Most have had some demograph'c support0And&#13;
most--Bangladesh, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Mexico, Nigzria,&#13;
Pakistan, Peru, the Philippines, Thailand and Turkey--have had substantial&#13;
help extending family planning services and information often in conjunc-&#13;

tion with government primary health care programs (where and UNICEF are&#13;
sometimes executing agency).&#13;
4.114     The World Bank is active in fewer countries, focusing on major&#13;
projects to extend government primary health care including family plan-&#13;
ning. Often there are multidonor projects where the Bank provides some&#13;
technical and organizational leadership--Bangladesh, Egypt, India, Indo-&#13;
nesia, Kenya, Philippines, and Thailand. These are, of course, countries&#13;
with relatively strong interest in population. Some are leaders in actual&#13;
establishment of family planning services (Indonesia, Thailand). They may&#13;
thus be more willing to borrow for population programs.&#13;
4.115     Among bilateral programs, the United States is most active, with&#13;
major efforts in Bangladesh, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Morocco, Peru,&#13;
the Philippines, Tanzania, Thailand, and Zaire. Compared to UNFPA and the&#13;
World Bank, the United States bilateral efforts have greater focus on&#13;
actual service delivery, particularly through outreach.&#13;
4.116     Other donors are typically active in several countries, often&#13;
though not always in collaboration with World Bank or UNFPA-led efforts.&#13;
4.117     Private organizations are also widely active--FPAs almost every-&#13;
where and some of the others in every country, sometimes with modest or&#13;
early stage efforts.&#13;

CHAPTER V&#13;
FUTURE OF POPULATION ASSISTANCE&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
5.01      The future of official development assistance for population&#13;
depends considerably on donors' assessments of four questions: (1) How!&#13;
serious is the "population problem" in terms of health, women'a rights,&#13;
development drag, or environment; (ii) How effective are the approaches to&#13;
dealing with population growth and high fertility; (iii) How welcome and&#13;
necessary is foreign assistance; and (iv) How politically sensitive is such&#13;
assistance at home.&#13;
5O2      While many donors believe agree that the "population problem"&#13;
deserves attention, limitations on political support for any development&#13;
assistance often keep aid levels down, and controversy over family planning&#13;
(strong in the United States currently) has helped keep population&#13;
assistance to no more than 2% of total aid0   If donors think that&#13;
population assistance is wanted, if they think that no one else will step&#13;
in to help, and if they think that population assistance wiorks reasonably&#13;
well, then they may be more inclined to take on the political hazards and&#13;
increase assistance at least modestly01/&#13;
5.03      As shortages of funds at UNFPA and IPPF suggest, demand for&#13;
population assistance is high and rising02/ W^hile population assistance&#13;
may have been sensitive in many countries a decade ago, the tide is&#13;
turning. Requests for population assistance now exceed available funds by&#13;
at least 20% conservatively estimated, and several organizations could&#13;
develop substantially larger portfolios of good projects within a year or&#13;
so. Over 90% of the people of the third world outside China now live in&#13;
countries whose governments have requested population assistance, largely&#13;
to extend family planning. About two-thirds live in countries whose&#13;
governments are committed to slowing population growth, though interest and&#13;
progress in doing so varies. The rest live in countries xwhere governments&#13;
at least support family planning as a health measureo The rising requests&#13;
for population assistance backed by support from national leaders and by&#13;
generally extensive use of services where available suggest that population&#13;
assistance is indeed wanted03/&#13;

2/   Although some of these projects are not fully developed, miost are,&#13;
according to these organizations0&#13;
3/   Though a view persists that donor governments may have overestimated&#13;
demand and be pressing recipient governments to take such assistance&#13;
for broader foreign policy reasonso See, e.g., Simon, Julian and&#13;
Kasun, Jacqueline.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 119 -&#13;
5.04      No major donor or channel believes another major source of&#13;
funding will be found to meet this demand for assistance--no convenient&#13;
deus ex machina will obviate the need for donors' help. Data are sketchy,&#13;
but developing countries generally cover an increasing share of family&#13;
planning costs themselves.&#13;
5.05      Most donors believe developing countries cannot be expected to&#13;
cover much larger shares of family planning program costs particularly as&#13;
they are trying to expand family planning and broader PHC systems.&#13;
Moreover, costs of lean systems arise largely from salaries, transport, and&#13;
medicines and thus recur, so that one massive effort to raise funds will&#13;
not solve the problem. However, donors, channels, and developing countries&#13;
are increasingly exploring ways of "self-financing" these systems by&#13;
charging something for services (perhaps still with a hefty subsidy as in&#13;
Bangladesh and Colombia), encouraging communities to help build and&#13;
maintain clinics (even in Africa) and support outreach workers (by using&#13;
homes or shops as distribution posts as in Indonesia or Brazil). Moreover,&#13;
contraceptives and other basic medicines are increasingly channeled through&#13;
commercial firms (e.g. USAID-supported "social marketing" of pills or&#13;
condoms in Jamaica and Bangladesh and a massive new proposal from India).&#13;
And the private sector is beginning to expand without donor involvement in&#13;
many urban areas where enough people can afford to pay market prices for&#13;
private health care. For the near term, however, commercial distribution&#13;
cannot obviate the extension of family planning or assistance to support&#13;
it. And, especially in poorer countries, government must be the main&#13;
source of basic health services in many areas where the private sector does&#13;
not reach. Thus donors' assessments of how well such assistance works and&#13;
how much assistance will be needed are critical to the future of population&#13;
assistance and population programs. This chapter considers issues that&#13;
bear on these two points:&#13;
- Effectiveness of population assistance programs;&#13;
- Voluntarism, coercion, and informed consent;&#13;
- Demand-side effects;&#13;
- "Leverage"; and&#13;
- Assessments of future needs&#13;
A. Effectiveness of Population Assistance Programs&#13;
5.06      Since population assistance focuses on family planning and has&#13;
contributed materially in almost all countries where family planning has&#13;
been extended widely, the basic question is: what have third world family&#13;
planning programs accomplished, and how has population assistance helped?&#13;
Most donors and channel organizations have focused on the impact of family&#13;
planning on population growth rather than health or other benefits.&#13;
The Demographic Base&#13;
5.07      Most population assistance goes to countries whose official&#13;
demographic objectives are expressed as reductions in "population growth&#13;
rates" (rates of natural increase). Since most also seek to reduce&#13;
mortality, population growth is to be slowed by more than proportional&#13;
reductions in birth rates, and "progress" is usually measured by birth rate&#13;
declines. Deciding how to measure the impact of "population programs" on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 120 -&#13;
birth rates has proved difficult for technical as well as practical&#13;
reasons. Nonetheless, substantial effort has been made, arguahly more than&#13;
for domestic family planning programs. At the outset, some argument exists&#13;
over whether birth rates are indeed the appropriate demographic "target"&#13;
since the crude birth rate is sensLtive to the age structure of the popula-&#13;
tion and other characteristics and thus does not simply indicate "fewer&#13;
births"0  Depending on what information is wsanted, demographers often advo-&#13;
cate more refined parameters. The net reproduction rate--the number of&#13;
daughters per woman--is one useful indicator of future growth patterns and&#13;
eventual "population stability"0 The total fertility rate gives a useful&#13;
picture of family size trendso And age-specific fertility rates will help&#13;
show shifts in childbearing patterns0 And so on0 UMFPA and USAID (bila-&#13;
terally) have spent considerable effort to establish data on these demogra-&#13;
phic variables and to follow them0 But the most common indicator of&#13;
progress that most donors use is still the crude birth rateo&#13;
5.08      Prima facie the evidence on birth rates is promising but sketchyo&#13;
Birth rates have indeed begun to fall in many developing countries, though&#13;
the pattern is neither uniform nor rapid0 (See Table 5.1o)&#13;
5o09      The proximate causes of birth rete declines include rising age of&#13;
marriage, changes in population structure, changes in nuptiallty and&#13;
breastfeeding, and changes in family planning practice (contraception and&#13;
abortion). Donors, and channel organizations, have typically focused on&#13;
changes in family planning practice since population assistance goes&#13;
largely to extend and improve family planning services.&#13;
5010      Age of marriage, breastfeeding, abortion, and contraception are&#13;
all thought to play major roles, in conjunction dith resulting shifts in&#13;
age structureo4/   Available information suggests that rising age of&#13;
marriage may account for roughly a fourth of birth rate declines at least&#13;
in Asiao Breastfeeding is thought to be declining, which wyould tend to&#13;
raise birth rates ceteris paribus (and not inconsiderably, since the&#13;
contraceptive effect of widespread breastfeeding is substantial)0    But&#13;
contraception also plays a role, though untangling causality is difficult&#13;
at besto Where abortion is widespread, contraception may at first&#13;
substitute substantially for abortiRon and so not be reflected fully in&#13;
birth rate declines0 It may also substitute for traditional methods, but&#13;
since these are likely to be less effective, there may more net impact on&#13;
birth rateso On the whole, more extensive practice of contraception (as&#13;
measured by "contraceptive prevalence") is thought to be associated with&#13;
lower birth rates across countries0 But no unanimity exists on precisely&#13;
what is meant by "contraceptive prevalence'" or how^ best to measure&#13;
"practice of contraception"0   Again it depends in good part cn what kind of&#13;
a measure is wanted0&#13;
5.11      Contraceptive prevalence is the "fraction of eligible couples&#13;
practicing contraception", put simply0 But the concept of "c%1igible&#13;
couples" is elusive--is it couples, or just wsomen, of "fert!le age"? 15044&#13;

or 13-49? Married or "in union"? Excluding those who are sterile or sub-&#13;
fecund? Those who are breastfeeding? Pregnant? Probably the most common&#13;
definition that donors and channel organizations use is women of reproduc-&#13;
tive age in union (usually ages 15-44, often assumed to be about 14% of the&#13;
total population)o5/   Next is the problem of defining "practicz"0   One&#13;
family-planning user is not necessarily equivalent to another. Some&#13;
methods are more effective "in use" than others--sterilization leads the&#13;
way, followed by pills, then IUD's, with natural methods oftem last (though&#13;
when actually used properly, which can be difficult, they work). Adjust-&#13;
ments are often made for method-effectiveness "in use". Moreever, it may&#13;
be hard to eliminate "switchers" from one method to another (.tncluding&#13;
those who turned to contraception after using abortion or tracAtional&#13;
methods, as well as those who switch among modern methods)O6/ It ls a-,so&#13;
difficult to know sometimes how long couples continue practicing contra-&#13;
ceptiono Finally, the age of family-planning users must be considered0&#13;
For example, sterilization of a 28 year old wyoman will on average avert&#13;
more births than sterilization of a 35 year old. These concerns have led&#13;
donors and channels to use increasingly such other measures as "couple-&#13;
years of protection" and "births averted" per user wlhich attempt to adjust&#13;
for age, effectiveness of methods, and other complications0 USAID and&#13;
UNFPA have supported efforts to refine "prevalence", augment It with other&#13;
measures, and organize service statistics and special demographic studies&#13;
to measure prevalence or other measures reasonably accuratelv in developing&#13;
countries0 But recognizing the conceptual difficulties, practical measure-&#13;
ment problems, and the hazards of cross-country comparisons, most donors&#13;
and channel organizations nonetheless accept the gist of the relationship&#13;
between prevalence and birth rates0 One frequently used chart comes from&#13;

The U.S. Bureau of Census has also compiled estimates of prevalence from&#13;
similar sources which USAID and the private channels also use.7/&#13;
5.12      In several countries listed in Table 5.2, major family planning&#13;
programs have been undertaken with massive support from population&#13;
assistance. Others--e.g., Korea, Taiwan, and Costa Rica--have as well.&#13;
Donors and channel organizations tend to regard programs as:&#13;
-    "Successes" in Indonesia, Thailand, Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore,&#13;
Costa Rica, Colombia, and Mexico;&#13;
-    "Intermediate cases" in India, the Philippines, and perhaps&#13;
Brazil, and Egypt;&#13;
-    "Disappointments" in Bangladesh, and Kenya, among others.&#13;
5.13      The assumption underlying such judgments is that program success&#13;
or failure can be measured by "resulting" contraceptive prevalence and its&#13;
apparent effect on birth rates.8/&#13;
Accounting for Differential Program Impact&#13;
5.14      But what actually accounts for the increased practice of family&#13;
planning? While family planning effort seems to play some role, a quick&#13;
look at key "demand side" indicators in the other columns of Table 5.2&#13;
suggests that family planning programs appeal most where social and&#13;
economic conditions are conducive.&#13;
5.15      Donors (notably the United States, United Kingdom, and Nordic&#13;
countries) and channel organizations have spent considerable effort to&#13;
determine more precisely what accounts for changes in birth rates, fertil-&#13;
ity, and family planning practice, and what role family planning programs&#13;
play in all three. Frequently the inquiry focuses on three key services:&#13;
-    How "good" are family planning services;&#13;
-    How "conducive" are socio-economic circumstances;&#13;
-    How "strong" is government commitment.&#13;
5.16      The debate on the impact of family planning itself was particu-&#13;
larly intense at USAID. As population assistance began, some program lead-&#13;
ers argued that "good services" would largely take care of the population&#13;
problem" more or less on their own. Where services appealed, they were&#13;
evidently fairly good, though improvements were always possible; where they&#13;
did not, they were not yet good. This conviction and the underlying dedi-&#13;
cation to making services available is thought to have helped secure fund-&#13;
ing for population assistance during its doubtful early days and to have&#13;

helped initiate programs. But it generated concern in developing coun-&#13;
tries, in channel organizations, and within the U.S. government0    "Demand"&#13;
aspects had gotten short shrift--indeed they were hardly acknowledged to&#13;
matter09/   Little was actually known then of what affected demand0   But&#13;
some demand-side enthusiasts thought that improving women's oDportunities&#13;
and raising living standards would naturally build interest in family plan-&#13;
ning, though family-planning enthusiasts often insisted that demand far&#13;
outran supply, pointing to existing indications of widespread abortion and&#13;
use of some family planning services010/&#13;
5o17      With little sound research available, the "great policy debate"&#13;
intensified throughout the international population community among donors,&#13;
channel organizations, and recipient countries0l1/ At the World&#13;
Population Conference in 1974, some accommodation was achieved0    The&#13;
emerging World Plan of Action was grounded in the view that both supply and&#13;
demand matteredo12/ But disagreement persisted0&#13;
5.18      Family planning advocates worried that the potential of family&#13;
planning programs was grossly underestimated and that the small fraction of&#13;
development assistance going for population activities would be diverted to&#13;
broader health, education, rural development or other efforts0 "Demand&#13;
side" advocates felt that failure to consider wMhat accounted for demand&#13;
would inhibit the progress of family planning and delay declines in birth&#13;
rates and fertility0&#13;
5019      UNFPA and USAID both undertook substantial "feertility determin-&#13;
ants" research focusing on how social and economic circumstances--and thus&#13;
policies and programs--most affect fertility013/ Program evaluations and&#13;
operations research approached the question from the other side, asking&#13;
what difference family planning made in controlled or semi-controlled expe-&#13;
riments014/ The presence of many influences on fertility and '.nevitable&#13;
limitations on data led to conceptual tangles and technical difficulties in&#13;

research that inhibited clear findings. Nonetheless some pattern seemed&#13;
discernible as results from research and improved program statistics par-&#13;
ticularly in Indonesia filtered in over the next two years or so, although&#13;
various aspects of the "pattern" were and would be challenged. Some prog-&#13;
ress toward accommodation occurred at USAID. The staunchest advocates of&#13;
demand had always insisted that family planning services ought to be&#13;
extended--demand-side efforts were meant to complement, not substitute for,&#13;
family planning. As it became apparent that population assistance would&#13;
not be diverted to demand-side programs and as social and economic&#13;
influences on family acceptance became clearer, most family planning advo-&#13;
cates felt population assistance was less threatened, though concern per-&#13;
sisted. In 1976 USAID issued its first population policy paper which&#13;
firmly established the principle that both supply and demand mattered.15/&#13;
But population assistance was to focus on extending and improving family&#13;
planning services and information, with some attention to explicating&#13;
demographic patterns, consequences, and determinants. The rest of&#13;
development assistance could work on the "demand-side". This conclusion&#13;
led to a legislative requirement that USAID design other development&#13;
assistance with a view to encouraging smaller families, by improving oppor-&#13;
tunities for women.16/ About the same time, USAID's legislation was also&#13;
changed to require additional efforts to improve the status of women&#13;
generally.&#13;
5.20       Several private organizations, notably IPPF, had for some time&#13;
argued the need to take demand into greater account while focusing on&#13;
supplying services and information. Several (including IPPF and Path-&#13;
finder) deliberately enlarged the scope of their activities to give more&#13;
leeway for analyzing fertility determinants and initiating experimental&#13;
programs to provide training and other opportunities for women in conjunc-&#13;
tion with family planning information and services.17/ UNFPA had also&#13;
long been convinced that a broad approach combining both supply and demand&#13;
would be more appropriate.&#13;
5.21       Several other countries, notably Sweden, Canada, and the United&#13;
Kingdom, also began exploring fertility determinants and modified their&#13;
population assistance policies to encompass demand as well as supply&#13;
issues, while continuing to support family planning.&#13;

furthered the supply-demand accommodation.18/ 3erelson basclc2.Ay stra-&#13;
tified countries according to demographic profile, socio-econonfc clrcum-&#13;
stances, and family planning program effort. He then considered how these&#13;
three aspects had and would affect family planln!ng practice ane future&#13;
population growth. He assessed the likelihood that lndividua1 countries&#13;
would reach a birth rate of 20 by the year 2000 and characteri%ed countries&#13;
as "certain", "probable", "possible", and "unlikely". 07rom this he&#13;
indicated prescriptions for population policy and allocations or'-&#13;
resourcesl9/ This wÂ¢ork was not used by donors in detail to allocate&#13;
funds but did stimulate discussion (particularly at USAID) on wYhether to&#13;
focus population assistance to maximize fertility reductions or to assist&#13;
the poorest countries (where fertility seemed less likely to fall), and on&#13;
how to bring demand-side influences to bear m-ore q-cEc'Llc' y sC that family&#13;
planning programs might be more appealing0&#13;
5o23      In a review of the effectiveness of family planning pzograms and&#13;
population assistance, USAID took Berelson's work a step further    focusing&#13;
on when countries were likely to be "ripe" for family planning,26/ The&#13;
"extreme" demand view was rejected: "it seems clear that family planning&#13;
programs can make a real difference in determining the rate at which ferti-&#13;
lity declines0"21/   But the issue was not to say "whether or noio family&#13;
planning programs can or do work"0o00"Of greater importance is learning how&#13;
one can know in advance that a program twill work0" 22&#13;
5.24      "Ripeness" suggested that family planning programs w^yould face&#13;
tougher going because of demand constraints and because programs weze&#13;
simply harder to organize and run efficiently wYhere poverty was rife,&#13;
transportation and communications haphazard, and management capacity highly&#13;
scarce0 In such circumstances, demographic impact might be minimal without&#13;
vigorous, even forceful efforts, that donors and developing countries alike&#13;
might find beyond the realm of voluntarism and so refuse to finance0 But&#13;
where development had advanced enough to make smaller families a more&#13;

attractive option and to ease the difficulty of operating programs,&#13;
voluntary family planning programs were likely to run more smoothly and to&#13;
lead to substantial increases in family planning practice, though at&#13;
varying levels, and to subsequent declines in fertility and birth rates,&#13;
though in varying degrees.23/&#13;
5.25      This conclusion helped secure funding for programs that were&#13;
considered to be "going well", e.g. in Indonesia. But it raised further&#13;
concerns for some of the poorest countries that seemed most anxious for&#13;
assistance to reduce birth rates--e.g. Bangladesh. At this point, early&#13;
results from several operations research projects entered the picture.&#13;
5.26      In various socio-economic settings, newer "outreach" services&#13;
organized along certain lines seemed to work better--and to make some demo-&#13;
graphic difference even in non-conducive settings, like Bangladesh, though&#13;
more in the more conducive settings.24/ Program statistics from Indonesia&#13;
were also encouraging, since Indonesia hardly offered a classically&#13;
"conducive" socio-economic setting, though some cultural patterns encour-&#13;
aged family planning.25/ The-"ripeness" concept and the emerging evidence&#13;
on what makes for "good" family planning services have led to a truer&#13;
accommodation of "supply" and "demand" among many donors and channel&#13;
organizations. This has been bolstered by increasing research and program&#13;
evaluations indicating how supply and demand aspects have related and&#13;

What has emerged is promising guidance for the family planning service and&#13;
information programs that are the core of population assistance.&#13;
Keys to "Good" Family Planning Programs&#13;
5.27      A strong consensus is emerging among donors, channels, and&#13;
developing countries favoring more "user perspective"--an approach that&#13;
considers what a family planning client, often a woman, seeks by way of&#13;
services, what her demand for family planning is likely to depend on, what&#13;
may limit or encourage her interest.27/ Typically each user seeks&#13;
services that are safe, effective, affordable, culturally acceptable, and&#13;
convenient, so that the psychological physical, and financial costs of&#13;
using services are minimized. The keys to achieving something close to a&#13;
user perspective" are thought to include:&#13;
-    attention to cultural mores;&#13;
-    a variety of methods of contraception;&#13;
-    adequate information about methods (pros and cons) that users can&#13;
understand accurately;&#13;
-    close personal contact and regular follow-up;&#13;

low cost, especially for poor women who cannot afford health care&#13;
or associated transportation or lost time from work028!&#13;
528      It is equally clear that more effective attention must go to the&#13;
manager's perspective--if programs cannot be run on a large sca`e, then&#13;
they certainly cannot meet many users' needs. Management in t'nis context&#13;
often involves emphasizing judicious choice of objectives, affordabilIty&#13;
and administrability (supervision of personnel and logistics)0&#13;
5.29      Management problems, broadly interpreted, are seen aS a primary&#13;
constraint in extending services efficiently, especially in poorer&#13;
countries, e.g. Bangladesh. Promising pilot efforts have foun6ered when&#13;
extended on a wider scale, either because a key leader could nct be replic-'&#13;
ated (an "automatic" management system could not be devised) or because of&#13;
"dinosaur" problems associated with increasing scale. Accordi_ng to several&#13;
studies funded by various donors and channel organizations, the critical&#13;
problem often seems to be "system overload", although research on&#13;
management aspects of family planning programs is surprisingly scarce&#13;
considering how much concern management problems have caused.     hnen needs&#13;
are vast, the temptation to try to meet several needs at once can be almost&#13;
irresistable--but may yield programs too complex to operate ef.ectively on&#13;
a substantial scale. Thus the initial management need is to keep program&#13;
objectives within practical limits, a wrenching task when severe resource&#13;
constraints compel choices among measures "needed" on any reasonable basis.&#13;
5.30      Of course, user and management perspective may conflict0    While&#13;
managers may agree on the need for more "user perspective" simply because&#13;
they want programs to be effective, "user perspective" implies more method&#13;
variety and more intensive service delivery to maintain personz' contact&#13;
and assure follow-up--and that can increase management requirements&#13;
substantially0 Some believe that true "user perspective" projects can only&#13;
operate on a pilot or limited scale. Then there is the question of "how&#13;
much" health to integrate with family planning, or whether indeed to try to&#13;
supply family planning services fairly separately from other h&amp;aath care0&#13;
Here research and program data provide conflicting results as befits the&#13;
complexity of the question0   Again the goal may be to do as much as&#13;
possible without swamping the system. In practice, considerable trfla and&#13;
error may be needed to find reasonable a solution0&#13;
5.31      Adjusting objectives to What is feasilbe and afforda_1e has&#13;
proved somewhat easier with the advent of information on the cost and&#13;
impact of various family planning or health "interventions" emerging from&#13;
operations research and other analytic efforts0   More information on what&#13;
resources may be available from the community (through charges for services&#13;

or contributions of service providers, distribution posts, etc.) will&#13;
doubtless also help.&#13;
5.32      But actual cost and impact of alternative interventions depend&#13;
considerably on associated management strategy--particularly logistics and&#13;
personnel administration. Several programs with promising blueprints--&#13;
objectives, general types of interventions--have foundered in the event,&#13;
and problems of logistics and personnel administration (selection, train-&#13;
ing, organizations, salaries), are commonly thought to account for much of&#13;
the difficulty. Several donors and channels do emphasize the need for more&#13;
effective management covering personnel administration and logistics. Here&#13;
guiding research is thought to be quite scarce. The principles seem clear&#13;
enough, but devising sound personnel management or logistics systems has&#13;
often proved far easier said than done, causing concern for medicines or&#13;
contraceptives piled in warehouses, outreach workers unaware of the&#13;
fundamentals of family planning, bureaucratic in-fighting, and apparent&#13;
waste of assistance resources.&#13;
5.33       Satisfying user and management requirements simultaneously has&#13;
thus proved an elusive goal. Nonetheless some consensus is emerging in the&#13;
developing countries and among donors and channel organizations on promis-&#13;
ing approaches. Basically the hope lies in outreach, ultimately in&#13;
community-based distribution of family planning and basic health care.&#13;
5.34      Virtually everyone agrees on the importance of providing a&#13;
variety of methods (including temporary as well as permanent) so that&#13;
users' different preferences can be better satisfied. Increased acceptance&#13;
as more methods are provided is now well established. It seems particu-&#13;
larly important to make the pill readily available, as it is often the&#13;
choice of most family planning clients when it is available. IUD's are&#13;
popular in some cultures. Condoms vary in appeal, as do other barrier&#13;
methods. (Some of the newer barrier methods, e.g., vaginal foams and&#13;
tablets, are proving highly acceptable in early trials in Asia and Africa.)&#13;
Perhaps most dramatic is the extensive demand for sterilization even where&#13;
services are difficult to obtain (as in Brazil). Also worth noting is&#13;
demand for depoprovera, the injectible method not yet approved in the&#13;
United States as a contraceptive and therefore not provided by USAID but&#13;
nonetheless used widely in several developing countries, e.g. Thailand, and&#13;
requested by others.&#13;
5.35      A consensus also seems to be emerging among many donors, chan-&#13;
nels, and developing countries that hierarchical delivery systems with a&#13;
"broad pyramid" based on service delivery by paramedical "outreach" workers&#13;
can promote impact, reduce costs, and ease management constraints. Such&#13;
systems should rely on community-based distribution of contraceptives and&#13;
perhaps medicines such as chloroquine or oral rehydration salts or even&#13;
soaps at the household level or as close as is practical, by outreach work-&#13;
ers culturally compatible with their own clients (often women). The&#13;
systems should also include adequate referral at least to local clinics to&#13;
handle maternal and child health problems beyond the scope of outreach&#13;
workers. Of course these principles must be refined considerably to suit&#13;
local conditions. Health and family planning needs, level of education,&#13;
density of the population served, terrain, weather, and nature of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 132 &#13;
existing health infrastructure and associated political insti:utiOns all&#13;
affect the kinds of outreach that make sense0&#13;
5036      Exactly "how much health"' to provlde along with famlly planning&#13;
and how closely to integrate the delivery of family planning End other&#13;
health services remains an unresolved issue and indeed must depend&#13;
considerably on each country's oz areas economic, cultural, and environmen-&#13;
tal circumstances. Nonetheless som.e broad points may be worth noting.&#13;
5.37      Many donors and channel orgenizations believe 'it crDtical to keep&#13;
the management system simple--main objectives clear, authority lines clear,&#13;
responsibilities at each level cleza-since the practical d&amp;fUicultieS of&#13;
operating any health care are so formidable in many places0 .T:hus some,&#13;
particularly at USAID and in the private organizations, and also in some&#13;
developing countries (e.g. Indonesia), have suggested it may be better at&#13;
least in early stage programs to focus outreach fairly heavily on family&#13;
planning and perhaps closely related maternal and child heaitnh (Advice on&#13;
breastfeeding and nutrition, monitoring of children's growth, oral&#13;
rehydration treatment for diarrhea, immunizaticn, and advice on sanitation&#13;
are among the most cost-effective mceasures to promote maternal and child&#13;
health in the view of several donors0)   Some, particularly Swyden, are&#13;
reluctant to focus too narrowly on family planning and urge integration of&#13;
family planning into basic maternal and child health care0 Some donors and&#13;
developing countries (like India) believe outreach can sometinmec begin with&#13;
a broader range of family planning and health sezvices0 Since outreach is&#13;
still a relatively new idea and is being tested in a variety of plEces, a&#13;
clearer picture must await further experience0   But the organiration charts&#13;
and the experience of programs with relatively comprehensive health care do&#13;
often raise concerns as their compzehensiveness increases0 It is clear&#13;
that too frequent and radical shi&lt;:its in organiration (e0go Bangladesh) can&#13;
retard progress0  A particularly interesting experiment is unesrway tEith&#13;
USAID funding in Indonesia0 There, family planning outreach was initially&#13;
added onto health clinics0 Now an effort is underway to add basic maternal&#13;
and child health and nutritional services onto the family planning outreach&#13;
layer, to test whether health and/or family planning practice improves or&#13;
suffers under such a system0&#13;
5o38      USAID, SIDA, and the major private channels are all casically&#13;
convinced by the outreach approach; UMFPA, which responds to country&#13;
requests, welcomes proposals along these lines0   The governmeats of&#13;
Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Ilzxico, Philippines, 12orocco&#13;
and Thailand, to name a few, are convinced of this approach0&#13;
5.39      Donors and channel organizations, agaln together w^gith the deve-&#13;
loping countries themselves, have naturally 21so been concerned about the&#13;
costs of family planning programs--fIrst to dstermine costs an.d benefits or&#13;
cost-effectiveness and second to determine wahen developing countries can&#13;
reasonably take over financing for these services. Again technical debats&#13;
rages on how beat to define and measure 'ben1fitso", D    S     nd "cost-&#13;
effectiveness"0   The "benefits" arise from b!irths averted thrcugh family&#13;
planning and from improved health0 The major focus has been on births&#13;
averted0  But measuring benefits of averted births involves azl: the debate&#13;
on economic gains from lower fertility, to say nothing of pocsable "limits&#13;
to growth"0  Even counting averted births involves counting non-evento,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 133 -&#13;
never easy. This has led to elaborate (and sometimes contested)&#13;
demographic models of what might have been, which USAID and UNFPA have&#13;
helped develop. A simpler approach focuses on cost-effectiveness measured&#13;
in terms of family planning use--cost per user, or better, cost per&#13;
couple-year-of-protection (adjusted for method-effectiveness, age, etc.).&#13;
But this measure tells policy makers relatively little about program stage&#13;
or progress, whether the "easy" early acceptors have been reached, whether&#13;
marginal costs will rise and how fast, or what underlies patterns of&#13;
marginal cost changes. Nonetheless, most donors and channels rely on cost&#13;
per user to gauge cost-effectiveness. Often an attempt is made to&#13;
distinguish between new and continuing users. Sometimes efforts are also&#13;
made to adjust at least roughly for method effectiveness and/or age of&#13;
users, and occasionally strenuous efforts are made to estimate costs per&#13;
couple year of protection. A related measure of affordability is cost of&#13;
service coverage per capita population, which makes it easier to compare to&#13;
PHC and other health services commonly planned on that basis.&#13;
5.40      USAID has probably led among donors in supporting efforts to&#13;
determine cost-effectiveness through its operations research and other&#13;
programs, although no donor lacks concern in this area. Clear answers have&#13;
been frustratingly elusive. Complicating factors include how much "health"&#13;
is combined with family planning, how much services or commodities are&#13;
donated by donors or indeed by local communities, and how popular the&#13;
family planning services prove to be. Within these constraints, all the&#13;
private organizations and USAID have published some estimates of costs per&#13;
active user, per new acceptor, or per couple-year-of-protection under their&#13;
programs. Usually donors and channels simply divide total program costs by&#13;
reported acceptors ("new" and/or "continuing"). It appears that costs may&#13;
exceed $20 per active user annually in more difficult settings where&#13;
volunteer service providers may be few, pre-existing health infrastructure&#13;
scarce, and management even scarcer, and where culture may require&#13;
provision of family planning in conjunction with much broader maternal and&#13;
child health--as in much of Africa. But even in rural Bangladesh, programs&#13;
can be designed with sufficient appeal and "leanness" to give costs of&#13;
below $10 per active user. In Latin America, costs of family planning&#13;
outreach in rural areas fall in the $10-20 range, clinic-based programs&#13;
closer to $15, and some urban outreach programs under $3 net of&#13;
contraception. IPPF reports overall cost per user averaging under $2 per&#13;
year. FPIA reports closer to $7, more in Africa. The Indonesia program&#13;
reports about $15, perhaps $10 for the family planning portion. All of&#13;
these cost estimates are very soft. Aside from the conceptual and&#13;
definitional problems, the measurement problems can be appalling. But they&#13;
give ballpack notions--costs presently average $10 or $20 per user per&#13;
year, not $100.&#13;
5.41      To the extent that community participation can be increased,&#13;
costs can be reduced sharply. In some settings, e.g., Bangladesh, most&#13;
program leaders believe people are too poor to be asked to pay anything for&#13;
family planning, though even there some experiments are underway in&#13;
subsidized pricing. In Brazil, BEMFAM argues for free services, while in&#13;
Colombia, PROFAMLIA charges subsidized prices--and attracts some clients&#13;
from lower cost or free government programs because of superior service&#13;
through local outreach. As family planning becomes established, it seems&#13;
increasingly possible to attract local resources to help defray costs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 134 -&#13;
through sales of contraceptives or constraction of clinics by communities0&#13;
After all, even in poorer countries people do spend several dollars per&#13;
capita annually on health care of one kind or another. Ultimately,&#13;
commercial distribution of contraceptives can assist tremendously, as in&#13;
much of Latin America (sometimes on a subsidized basis--so called "social&#13;
marketing")0&#13;
5.42      Finally, some consensus seems to be emerging on an institutional&#13;
progression that appears to work well in many circumstances. Tne private&#13;
organizations after act particularLy effectively to initiate cervices and&#13;
then to family planning extend the frontiers, showing on a small scale that&#13;
new approaches will work, while the government gradually assumes primary&#13;
responsibility for the bulk of family planning service delivery and extends&#13;
coverage to the majority of the populationo&#13;
How Donors and Channels Believe Assistance lelp&#13;
5.43      Finally, donors and channels have given considerable thought to&#13;
the forms and style of assistance that may be most effective0&#13;
5.44      UNFPA believes its strengths are its relatively apolitical&#13;
nature, its flexibility, its capacity for grant funding, and its ability to&#13;
cover a variety of needs0   Its links to other U.N. organizations also&#13;
permits it to draw on their technical and organizational abil ..ty. It has&#13;
also developed considerable experience in mapping out needs and potential&#13;
policy and program approaches0 Finally, it has the capacity to organize&#13;
multidonor efforts0&#13;
5.45      The private organizations also believe their strengths are&#13;
flexibility, creativity, continuity, cost-effectiveness, and ability to&#13;
work closely with private indigeneous organizations0 Grant funding is&#13;
another strength in their view0&#13;
5.46      USAID believes its hands-on-approach is critical0    It operates&#13;
field missions in all major program countries and staffs many of these with&#13;
population/health officers0 This promotes faster development of program&#13;
proposals, rapid response, and continue moniloring and adjustment0 USAID&#13;
also believes flexible and rapid funding mechanisms, covering some local as&#13;
well as foreign-exchange costs, are critical0 The Agency also finds grant&#13;
funding a help in a field like population wyhere many countries are still at&#13;
a fairly early stage of program development and where many costs recur&#13;
annuallyo Finally, the Agency believes its emphasis on private&#13;
organizations also promotes innovation, flexibility, and responsiveness0&#13;
It has increased loan-funding particularly in Asia but still provides some&#13;
90% of its population assistance as grants0&#13;
5.47      Finally, the World Bank considers its strength to be in sound&#13;
project development, ability to discuss population concerns in broader&#13;
policy dialogues experience in organizing multidonor efforts to support&#13;
major government efforts to extend family planning and health care, and&#13;
flexibility in meeting government's varying needs0 It intends to double&#13;
its population and related health lending in the next few years, focusing&#13;
on Asia and Africa0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 135 -&#13;
B. Informed Consent, Voluntarism, and Coercion&#13;
5.48      Given the political sensitivity of population assistance and the&#13;
widespread concern for voluntarism, the linked issues of voluntarism, coer-&#13;
cion, and informed consent affect the future of population assistance&#13;
substantially. They currently arise in three main ways.&#13;
Safety and Informed Consent&#13;
5.49      Since most contraceptives have side effects, concern arises that&#13;
clients understand the benefits and associated risks and give not only&#13;
voluntary but also informed consent. (Even some "natural family planning"&#13;
methods have practical problems.) Critics of family planning fear or&#13;
believe that unsafe or untested family planning methods may be imposed on&#13;
poor and uneducated people, women especially.29/ They point to past occa-&#13;
sions when clients' lack of understanding did apparently lead to misuse of&#13;
contraceptives and allege that shoddy delivery of services continues with-&#13;
out enough regard for clients' welfare. Too little effort has gone, they&#13;
believe, to ensuring consent based on real understanding. Failing this,&#13;
they argue that family planning programs should be curtailed. Family plan-&#13;
ning supporters have also endorsed the principle of informed consent. They&#13;
too know of instances where clients apparently misunderstood and misused&#13;
methods or ceased practicing family planning altogether. But while sup-&#13;
porters agree that clients ought to understand the pros and cons of avail-&#13;
able methods thoroughly, they support programs that do a good--albeit&#13;
imperfect--job. Basically they consider the dangers of contraception to be&#13;
often overestimated and the benefits underestimated and argue that the&#13;
perfect should not be the enemy of the good. They also press for increased&#13;
attention to "user perspective" via training of outreach workers, informa-&#13;
tion for clients, and more practical and meaningful guidelines on voluntary&#13;
consent.&#13;
5.50      Particular concern has focused on sterilization since it is&#13;
generally permanent and few clients are likely to be familiar with it. For&#13;
example, many men have apparently been discouraged from vasectomy by con-&#13;
fusing it with castration. Women, on the other hand, need to understand&#13;
what to expect post-operatively and how to care for themselves (since many&#13;
go home the same day to care for husbands and children). Thus USAID and&#13;
AVS, among others, have taken great pains to develop guidelines to ensure&#13;
voluntary and informed consent for sterilization.30/ With such efforts--&#13;
and with increasing numbers of satisfied sterilization clients--concern on&#13;
sterilization has begun to subside. But the allegedly coercive programs of&#13;
India are remembered; and China's recent policy of encouraging couples to&#13;
have only one child causes concern.&#13;
5.51      The concern about safety has prompted additional biomedical&#13;
research to try to understand existing methods as fully as possible, lessen&#13;
their associated risks, and develop better methods. USAID's efforts to&#13;
develop and refine safer sterilization technologies (especially the&#13;

minilap, developed in Thailand), safer IUDs (some twenty have seen rejec-&#13;
ted), and the new cervical sponge have resulted from such resenrch 31/&#13;
Studies on the pill in Britain and elsewhere over many years have helped&#13;
establish the pill's overall safety, identify some beneficial side effects,&#13;
and define risks that do exist more precisely. This has helped ease&#13;
concern for women in the prime childbearing years. These are t.he women&#13;
most likely to be interested in child-spacing, 9hich is what the pill is&#13;
primarily intended for. Higher-risk wyomen are those over 35, t-hose who&#13;
smoke, and those with a history of high blood pressure or cer6iovascular&#13;
problem. Such women are generally more interested in ceasing child-&#13;
bearing, which is not what the pill is primarily intended to accomplisho&#13;
Research has also helped elucidate side effects of pills for malnourished&#13;
women and inspired development of lowuer dose pillso   It hag aLso improved&#13;
understanding of breastfeeding and contraception, leading to recommenda-&#13;
tions that breastfeeding mothers not use pills at least for several months&#13;
(but use something else to remain non-pregnant and so continue breast-&#13;
feeding) .32/&#13;
5.52      Few medicines are perfectly understood. A difficult choice&#13;
arises when promising methods are being tested0 Depoprovera :.s the subject&#13;
of uuch debate at present. IPPF recommended its use several years ago, and&#13;
UNFPA now supplies ito   It is also in wide use in Thailand and Indonesia,&#13;
and several other governments have requested it0 Women find it convenient&#13;
(it is a long-acting injectible), and no strong evidence of secious side&#13;
effects has emerged after a decade or so of use0 But in the United States,&#13;
depoprovera is still not approved by the domestic health authorilties as a&#13;
contraceptive. USAID therefore does not provide it or any other contracep-&#13;
tive until approved for use in the United States0&#13;
5.53      Lurking behind this and similar controversies is the emotionally&#13;
charged issue of "second class medicine"0 Several years ago USAID wras also&#13;
accused of "dumping" various contraceptives ln the third world and con-&#13;
tinues to face similar chargeso33/ Others have taken the argument a step&#13;
further, suggesting that contraceptives should be provided for use in&#13;
developing countries on the same basis as they are used in the United&#13;
States0 If a pill requires a physician's prescription in the United States&#13;
to ensure adequate safety, then it should also require one in Bangladesh;&#13;
if sterilizations are done in hospita.s in the United States, so should&#13;
they be in Thailand0 Others point out the greater hazards frcz pregnancy&#13;
and childbirth under the conditions that will tragically but lnevitably&#13;
obtain at least for the near term in the thi&amp;d world0    In the case of&#13;
pills, USAID does supply them for use overseas on terms the requesting&#13;
government decides. tut disregard for clients' welfare would clearly&#13;
produce political pressure to cease this practice0&#13;

What Services are Offered&#13;
5.54      Donors tend to provide only those methods that are compatible&#13;
with their own cultures as defined by their own political processes. Thus&#13;
few donors or channels fund abortion. Although abortion is legal under&#13;
fairly broad circumstances in the United States and other donor countries,&#13;
USAID is legally prohibited from using population assistance to fund or&#13;
encourage abortion. For some years, USAID was able to fund research&#13;
related to abortion (which is also often research related to conception,&#13;
infertility, and prevention of conception), but this too is now&#13;
prohibited. Some opponents of abortion also consider the IUD an aborta-&#13;
facient, and some classify the pill similarly, and thus oppose providing&#13;
either one through foreign assistance. Some support only "natural family&#13;
planning" and press to ensure that these options are included--or to&#13;
restrict population assistance to natural methods. In some donor nations&#13;
separation of church and state may be fundamental in law, but religious&#13;
groups can exert enough political power to affect government-funded health&#13;
and family planning programs (domestic as well as international). Thus&#13;
people in the developing countries may be in effect restricted to options&#13;
acceptable politically in the donor countries. From the donors' perspec-&#13;
tive, that may seem perfectly sensible--they do not want to fund what they&#13;
disapprove of. And, it is said, developing countries can fund other&#13;
methods themselves.&#13;
5.55      Yet developing countries seek assistance to provide the same&#13;
kinds of contraception--pills, IUDs, sterilizations--that are widely&#13;
available and widely used in the donor countries (with the exception of&#13;
depoprovera). In some countries, particularly the poorer ones, funding any&#13;
major contraceptive without some population assistance may be difficult as&#13;
a practical matter.&#13;
Incentives&#13;
5.56      The issue of incentives has not moved much beyond the&#13;
"theoretical" stage discussed above in most donor nations or in channel&#13;
organizations since so few requests to assist incentive programs have been&#13;
received. But, as noted, experiments are now getting underway. As more&#13;
countries like Bangladesh, Egypt, Sri Lanka, and Thailand wish to expand&#13;
incentive programs and request increased donor assistance, the debate may&#13;
heat up.&#13;
C. Demand Side&#13;
5.57      Another issue bearing on effectiveness of population assistance&#13;
is the "demand side" question: would it reduce birth rates as fast or&#13;
faster to de-emphasize family planning and concentrate move on promoting&#13;
development to build interest in smaller families? Several donors and&#13;
channel organizations have expressed interest in strengthening demand for&#13;
family planning through particular aspects of development--notably by&#13;
improving women's opportunities. Most active on the demand-side are UNFPA&#13;
and USAID though IPPF, Pathfinder, the Population Council, the United&#13;
Kingdom, and some Nordic countries have also funded exploratory efforts to&#13;
"integrate" family planning and development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 138 -&#13;
5.58      Occasionally such "demand-side" efforts generate concern for&#13;
tampering with "voluntarism"o But usually the demand side hao enjoyed&#13;
broader political support, primarily because: (i) it has been obvious that&#13;
voluntary family planning decisions inevitably reflect social and economic&#13;
setting; (ii) the kinds of development activities that tend to build demand&#13;
for smaller families--improving women's education and employment prospects,&#13;
and maternal and child health--are deemed worthy of support in their own&#13;
right; and (iii) some who favor lower birth rates but oppose any but&#13;
"natural family planning" methods see the demand side as a route to faster&#13;
birth rate declines0&#13;
5.59      For several years, USAID has been required by law to consider&#13;
both demand and supply. "All appropriate activities 000 [supported by&#13;
development assistance] shall be designed to build motivation for smaller&#13;
families through modificational economic and social conditions supportive&#13;
of the desire for large families, in programs such as education in and out&#13;
of school, nutrition, disease control, maternal and child health services,&#13;
improvements in the status and employment of women, agricultural produc-&#13;
tion, rural development, and assistance to the urban poor and through&#13;
community-based development programs which give recognition to people&#13;
motivated to limit the size of their families" .34/&#13;
5.60      The authority is obviously very broad, covering most areas of&#13;
development assistance and (in the last phrase) permitting community incen-&#13;
tives. Guidance on implementation has emphasized the need to influence&#13;
'Â°early age of marriage for girls; prevailing large family norms; uncer-&#13;
tainty concerning child survival; and unintended births0"    USAID Missions&#13;
have been asked to consider practical approaches reflecting varying socio-&#13;
economic circumstances such as increasing the number of female teachers and&#13;
making school hours more flexible, improving vocational training, exploring&#13;
pilot programs to encourage female labor-force participation, and experi-&#13;
mental old-age support programs035/ Actual implementation has varied0&#13;
Evaluations have not been done, buit impression suggests that most progress&#13;
has occurred in encouraging female education.&#13;
5.61      Among other donors, the United Kingdom (through ODA) has funded&#13;
some research and integrated projects designed to further w-Tomen's opportun-&#13;
ities and encourage family planningo Norway has also given particular&#13;
attention to this area0&#13;
5.62      Among the private organizations, one of the Pathfinder's three&#13;
major program areas is improvement of women's opportunities. Pathfinder&#13;
has funded a number of women's organizations (e.g. Maendeleo 'n Kenya)&#13;
interested in building family planning into their owm efforts and has&#13;
supported various efforts to broaden women's opportunities0&#13;
5.63      For several years IPPF has supported a series of efforts to&#13;
promote opportunity for women while furnishing family plannirn advice and&#13;
services, as noted earlier. For example, in Indonesia these efforts have&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 139 -&#13;
led to comparatively greater acceptance of family planning and helped the&#13;
FPA to press for improved opportunities for women as part of a broad&#13;
approach to population.&#13;
5.64       UNFPA has recognized the need to improve opportunities for women&#13;
as an appropriate part of a broad approach to population issues. It has&#13;
provided substantial support to assess and plan for the role of women in&#13;
development (partly with FAO), to study the relationship between education&#13;
and age of marriage, fertility, and family planning (via UNESCO and WFS),&#13;
and it has extended support for the U.N. Conferences on women in&#13;
development.&#13;
D. Leverage&#13;
5.65       Should donor nations or channel organizations try to press reci-&#13;
pient nations to undertake more vigorous efforts to reduce birth rates? Or&#13;
to extend particular kinds of family planning programs? "Leverage" is one&#13;
of the most politically volatile issues associated with population assist-&#13;
ance--"coercion on a national scale" is the usual reaction. Yet another&#13;
view persists that it is "common sense" to encourage attention to popula-&#13;
tion or foster more effective use of scarce assistance funds.&#13;
What the Policy Is&#13;
5.66       The official policy of every donor nation and channel organiza-&#13;
tion is that the population policy of recipient nations is and should be up&#13;
to them--that efforts to press recipient countries to "do more" on the&#13;
population front would be out of place. Some donor and channel organiza-&#13;
tions also shy away from any prescriptive advice on particular approaches&#13;
to family planning or population issues more broadly, though others regard&#13;
this as an appropriate area for professional exchange of views.&#13;
Why Donors and Channels Avoid Leverage&#13;
5.67       Donor nations and channel organizations all believe efforts at&#13;
leverage would be--and would be perceived as--inappropriate and undue&#13;
interference in national, cultural, and personal affairs. In developed&#13;
countries, governments are generally expected to avoid interfering in citi-&#13;
zens' private lives, and they are naturally even more loathe to interfere&#13;
overseas. They generally believe leverage in population matters would&#13;
raise the spectre of imperialism at its worst--thoughtless imposition of&#13;
Western value judgments on the very heart of other cultures, racism, and&#13;
even "genocide". This would in turn generate a political backlash just as&#13;
programs considered coercive apparently did in India. The backlash could&#13;
make extension of family planning that much more difficult, not only in the&#13;
countries where leverage was tried, but where programs might already be&#13;
doing well, thus killing the goose that lays the golden egg. Donors have&#13;
therefore rejected the whole idea of leverage on the grounds that it is&#13;
morally abhorrent to them as well as to the recipient nations.&#13;
5.68       The strong feelings and resulting potential for political diffi-&#13;
culty surrounding "leverage" have inhibited and at times actually prevented&#13;
much discussion on the underlying question, which goes to the heart of&#13;
development assistance programs of any kind.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
140 -&#13;
5.69       Should donors or channel organizations provide &amp;ssictance to&#13;
developing nations with "no strings" or should they try to encourage twYhat&#13;
they believe to be the most effective use of assistance? Uhat are donors'&#13;
legitimate interests? What are the recipient naticns2 legitimate interests&#13;
and what are their feelings, especially in complex international dealings&#13;
among sovereign nations where richer nations look to poorer nat.ions in some&#13;
strategic, political and economic zetters?   Is population so `special" el n&#13;
area of assistance that this underlying question is to be avoided?&#13;
The "Temptation of Leverage"&#13;
5o70      Some among donor governments from tiwe to time may i-ave been&#13;
tempted toward leverage from concern that failure to reduce bW--.th rates&#13;
significantly can hamper other effcrts to improve living stan&amp;grds,&#13;
including those supported through development assistance. Failure of&#13;
developing countries to reduce birth rates-or at least to try--can&#13;
precipitate two polar reactions among the public in develcped countries,&#13;
particularly where international linkages are not alWays fully understood.&#13;
5.71      The first extreme reaction is a "uhat's the use" fruceration that&#13;
may in turn lead to a "lifeboat" view--"we will have to save ourselves"&#13;
and since there is "nothing else to do" when peLrsistent populaÂ¢:ion growth&#13;
erodes the gains of development.&#13;
5.72      The second extreme reaction is more apocalyptic. Even radical&#13;
efforts must be made to reduce birth rates since the Four {irÂ£emr are&#13;
already on the horizon. Some groups in donor countries may fear imm-inent&#13;
and substantial "spillover effects" from immigratlon, politica,l upheaval&#13;
due in part to demographic pressure2 or possibly economic and environmental&#13;
problems also thought to be partly traceable to demographic pressure;&#13;
others are simply aggalled by the spectre of massive famine ard suffering&#13;
in the third worldo__&#13;
The Reasonable Middle&#13;
5.73      What often follows is a middle-Toed positiong the s:ctuation&#13;
cannot be ignored, but it cannot be fixed overnight. In the m2antlme,&#13;
donors and channel organizations can try to promote developmen.,i particu-&#13;
larly by addressing basic needs2 9 which may help encourage smal.er families,&#13;
and help initiate family planning and be ready to extend progrEns when the&#13;
time comes. Nonetheless, since donors and channels stilL want assistance&#13;
to have impact, the old impatience for results resurfaces0              tl--a"r  their&#13;
sources of political support--want to show that development assistance is&#13;
not "money down the drain0" The pressure for results is particularly&#13;
intense in the United States, where many people already thinkt deelopment&#13;
assistance is money down the drain; demonstrat!ng impact can hclp achieve&#13;
the narrow margin of victory needed to assure funding037/&#13;
36/ See Chapter II above0&#13;
37/ IDA in Retrospect, Wlorld Bank2 Washington, 1982.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 141 -&#13;
5.74      In most areas of development assistance, donors' and recipients'&#13;
interests in what aid is meant to accomplish, how, and with what special&#13;
concerns can be balanced out in a "policy dialogue" between the recipient&#13;
government and the donor or channel. The World Bank conducts a very active&#13;
policy dialogue and has "conditions of effectiveness" for its loans in&#13;
various fields; the IMF exacts tough conditions for its shorter term&#13;
loans. USAID often tries to achieve at least informal understandings,&#13;
often supporting people within developing countries who are pressing for&#13;
similar objectives that may be difficult politically (e.g. land reform).&#13;
Is population too specially sensitive to be included at all in such a&#13;
process? Actually, some discussions of population issues and assistance do&#13;
occur, as they do in other fields, but the efforts are usually even more&#13;
low-keyed and diplomatic in population. Basically some donors and channel&#13;
organizations ask whether governments or other developing country&#13;
institutions wish to discuss population policy, family planning, or other&#13;
demographic issues, and they offer information on population trends, their&#13;
causes and consequences, and on what population assistance may be&#13;
available.&#13;
5.75      The private channels of course cannot exert any leverage as such&#13;
on recipient countries and in any case would be disinclined to try. It is&#13;
not their operating style. Their success is based on their ability to form&#13;
continual and close links to indigenous institutions. They do, however,&#13;
establish criteria for effectiveness; to obtain funding, a project must&#13;
demonstrate sound planning and promise.&#13;
5.76      UNFPA--the major channel for population assistance--is by concept&#13;
and regulation "neutral" with respect to population policy. It thus is not&#13;
supposed to recommend a particular approach to population. Nonetheless,&#13;
UNFPA is also instructed by its Governing Council to give increased atten-&#13;
tion to family planning services and information. As a practical matter,&#13;
UNFPA does ask developing country governments whether they would welcome&#13;
discussion of population and family planning and offers to do "Needs&#13;
Assessments" of individual countries which lay out the demographic situa-&#13;
tion and alternative approaches to family planning, etc. It does make&#13;
known to potential recipients the kinds of activities that it can fund.&#13;
It also tries to make its assistance generally attractive and responsive to&#13;
third world needs. It too provides grant funds, offers flexible funding&#13;
mechanisms, covers local costs, supports the widest range of needs of any&#13;
donor (though it too funds no abortion services). It also tries to&#13;
elucidate links between fertility and the "demand side", particularly&#13;
women's opportunities.&#13;
5.77      Although the World Bank recognizes the role of population in&#13;
development strategy, it has seldom discussed population extensively in&#13;
most of its "policy dialogues" with developing country governments. The&#13;
Bank is now increasing its attention to population in these dialogues as an&#13;
integral part of development thinking but will certainly not attempt&#13;
leverage on behalf of population programs. Some major supporters of the&#13;
Bank and some in developing countries have expressed the wish that the Bank&#13;
discuss population more extensively as part of its overall country&#13;
dialogue.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 142 -&#13;
E. Estimating "Future Needs"&#13;
5078      The leverage issue has been considerably mooted recently by the&#13;
surge of demand from developing countries for population assistanceo The&#13;
situation has naturally intensified donors' interest in the perennial ques-&#13;
tions of how much assistance will be needed and for how longo Even the&#13;
most enthusiastic donors aim to provide only temporary assistance, until a&#13;
developing country can assume support for its owne programs. As demand for&#13;
assistance intensifies, the tendency is to define "rtemporary" increasingly&#13;
narrowly. Although the prognosis in different regions and countries varies&#13;
widely, most donors and channels do recognize that multi-year efforts will&#13;
be essential since fertility changes gradually at best. Wonet6eless, the&#13;
United States, UNFPA, and all the major private organizations have empha-&#13;
sized the need to phase out assistance, even if very graduallyo This is&#13;
generally achieved by agreements on multi-year funding with gradual&#13;
decreases, by shifts from grants tow^jard loans where possible (particularly&#13;
with USAID), and by specific efforts to build developing country capacity&#13;
to sustain family planning, eog. through USAID and UNFPA assistance to&#13;
Indonesia to establish the capacity to tablet pills0 UNFPA has shifted&#13;
toward its "priority countries" and thus away from others (particularly&#13;
with higher income per capita) particularly in Latin America0 IPPF and&#13;
other private organizations have also attempted to limit assistance in&#13;
wealthier countries where family planning was fairly well established in&#13;
favor of startup efforts elsewhere0 The United States has attempted to&#13;
focus increasing support on Africa and on countries in Asia and Latin&#13;
America of particular interest to iDt, phasing out its bilateral programs in&#13;
better off countries like Colombia but continuing to assist through the&#13;
major private organizations and other private channels (e.g. university&#13;
research)0 On balance, it is fair to say that most donors and channels&#13;
have tried to focus population assistance on the poorer countries express-&#13;
ing demand and able to use it, while continuing to respond to major oppor-&#13;
tunities particularly to initiate services in other countries and that&#13;
phase-out has generally been approached gently0&#13;
5$79      Even with "optimistic" assumptions about phase-out, rising demand&#13;
for assistance has prompted efforts to estimate "future needs0" This has&#13;
proved very difficult, because no clear information exists in many areas on&#13;
how many people now have access to family planning, or on how difficult it&#13;
might be to extend services and information to those without, or on what&#13;
the absorptive capacity for foreign assistance might be0    Estitiating&#13;
ancillary needs or desires for research, demographic, and other policy-&#13;
related efforts is harder stillo Still, it appears that no mor-e than about&#13;
40% of people in developing countries outside China now have ready access&#13;
to modern contraceptives0 This level of service costs somewhat over $1&#13;
billion annually, wAth about $500 million covered by population&#13;
assistance0 Perhaps one-fifth of fertile age couples (over 1C0 million&#13;
couples) now practice contraceptior, with an associated crude bIrth rate of&#13;
about 37. If more people had access, more w^yould choose to practice family&#13;
planning0 Over 60 million more couples are thought to be willing, out of&#13;
those still needing accesso The result would be a substantIal drop in&#13;
birth rates (and in maternal and child mortality)0 This logic hmas formed&#13;
the basis of calls for increased population assistance on the part of USAID&#13;
in 198o038/&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This paper traces the sources of
            assistance for family planning &amp; other
            "population" programs from developed countries
            &amp; the flow of assistance through principal
            "channel" organizations to developing countries.
            The paper discusses why developing countries seek &amp; why
            developed countries offer population assistance, focusing on
            official views of how population growth &amp; high fertility
            affect economic development, environment, maternal &amp;
            child health, &amp; women's welfare. It explains why
            some countries are reluctant to seek or provide more
            population assistance. It analyzes what population
            assistance does to extend reliable &amp; affordable family
            planning services &amp; information &amp; to improve
            understanding of population growth, its causes, &amp;
            consequences. It summarizes current population policies
            &amp; family planning programs in major regions of the Third
            World &amp; discusses the role of assistance. The paper
            brings out comparative advantages of principal organizations
            providing population assistance. Finally, the paper
            discusses the evolution of "policy issues"
            affecting population assistance, especially donors'
            concern for "demand" for family planning,
            cost-effectiveness of family planning services, safety and voluntarism.
