Building Post-Crisis CaPaCity in the solomon islands&#13;

&#13;
     This Capacity Development Brief summarizes the results of a multidonor team review of four examples of&#13;
     post-crisis capacity development interventions in the Solomon Islands in 2005â&#128;&#147;08 whose performance&#13;
     was frequently cited as successful by local stakeholders. Although not based on post-project evaluations,&#13;
     the review found a number of patterns and potential lessons: (1) responding to immediate needs fos-&#13;
     ters national ownership, (2) â&#128;&#156;quick winsâ&#128;? can lay the basis for wider system impact, (3) being clear on&#13;
     â&#128;&#156;capacity for whatâ&#128;? is key to project success, (4) critical mass in capacity means taking a team approach,&#13;
     (5) training must be grounded in time-relevant and actively operational tasks, (6) a coaching and part-&#13;
     nering style is essential and, certainly, not optional, (7) leadership becomes catalytic in capacity develop-&#13;
     ment when a broader coalition is engaged, and in some cases supports a â&#128;&#156;heroic individualâ&#128;? as its leader.&#13;

            Building post-crisis capacity in the
            Solomon Islands
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This capacity development brief
            summarizes the results of a multi-donor team review of four
            examples of post-crisis capacity development interventions
            in the Solomon Islands in 2005-08 whose performance was
            frequently cited as successful by local stakeholders.
            Although not based on post-project evaluations, the review
            found a number of patterns and potential lessons: (1)
            responding to immediate needs fosters national ownership;
            (2) 'quick wins' can lay the basis for wider
            system impact; (3) being clear on 'capacity for
            what' is key to project success, (4) critical mass in
            capacity means taking a team approach; (5) training must be
            grounded in time-relevant and actively operational tasks;
            (6) a coaching and partnering style is essential and,
            certainly, not optional; and (7) leadership becomes
            catalytic in capacity development when a broader coalition
            is engaged, and in some cases supports a 'heroic
            individual' as its leader.
