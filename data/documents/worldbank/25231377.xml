including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee&#13;

applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2    Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") shall be administered in&#13;

time, including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard policies, its&#13;

Bank resources to finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the&#13;

Nations. The Donors acknowledge that this provision does not create any obligations of the Bank under&#13;
the anti-terrorist financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules and executive orders of an individual&#13;
member country that may apply to a Donor.&#13;
2.     Management of the Contributions&#13;

Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying Deposit&#13;
Instructions, the Bank shall convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the exchange rate&#13;
obtained by the Bank on the date of the conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to complete&#13;

responsibility for providing any additional financing.&#13;
2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other currencies&#13;

Administration Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change, the Bank&#13;
reserves the right to request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would&#13;

reference of such audit. Following agreement on the scope and terms of reference, the Bank shall arrange&#13;

consultants and/or other third parties for the purposes of this Administration Agreement, including any&#13;
Grant Agreements, prior to the receipt of such notice. In the event of a cancellation, the Bank shall return&#13;
to the Donor its pro-rata share in the Holding Currency as specified in the Administration Agreement,&#13;
unless otherwise agreed between the Bank and the Donor.&#13;

Fund in accordance with the Bank's Policy on Access to Information. By entering into Administration&#13;
Agreements, the Donors consent to such disclosure of their respective Administration Agreements and&#13;
such related information.&#13;
12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Grant Agreements and of any contractual remedies that are exercised by the Bank under any Grant&#13;
Agreements. To the extent practicable, the Bank shall afford the Donors the opportunity to exchange&#13;
views before effecting any such modification or exercising any such remedy.&#13;
13&#13;
