1. SECTORAL CONTEXT&#13;
A.    ECONOMIC CONTEXT AND TRANSPORT DEMAND&#13;
1.1   Vietnam is located in mainland Southeast Asia, stretching over 1,600 km from the&#13;
Chinese border in the north to the Gulf of Thailand in the south. The country's land area&#13;
is approximately 330,000 sq. km and the population exceeds 75 million.&#13;
1.2   Vietnam's primarily agrarian economy is growing and diversifying rapidly.&#13;
Although per capita income, at US$250 per year in 1995, is one of the lowest in the&#13;
world, Vietnam is committed to making the transition to a market economy, with the&#13;
introduction of an ambitious economic reform program (Doi Moi) in 1989. The result has&#13;
been an economic growth rate exceeding expectations, averaging 6.5 percent from 1990&#13;
to 1992, 8.1 percent in 1993, nine percent in 1994 and an estimated 10.0 percent in 1995.&#13;
Growth rates of 8-10 percent a year are projected for the rest of the decade. Agriculture,&#13;
which involves over 80 percent of households, grew by four percent. Construction was&#13;
the fastest growing sector in 1994 at 19 percent, followed by industry at 14 percent and&#13;
services at 10 percent.&#13;
1.3   Continued economic expansion is expected to generate growth in demand for&#13;
freight transport. Total freight traffic in Vietnam, estimated at about 53 million ton-km in&#13;
1993, is forecast to grow 7-11 percent a year for the rest of the decade,' with road traffic&#13;
increasing most rapidly (Figure 1.1).&#13;
B.    TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTURE&#13;
1.4   Transport infrastructure in Vietnam is in a poor state of repair due to war damages&#13;
and the subsequent years of economic stagnation; as a result, it cannot meet the expected&#13;
growth in demand.  Although budget allocations have grown in the 1990s, both&#13;
maintenance and capital expenditures remain under-funded. Indeed, to provide adequate&#13;
transport infrastructure, annual outlays would need to almost double, to 2-3 percent of&#13;
GDP (about 2.4 percent for capital investment and 0.6 percent for maintenance), and kept&#13;
at this level for the next 10-15 years.2&#13;

Table 1.1), with differences reflected in regional modal shares of traffic. For example, in&#13;
the country as a whole, roads carry almost two-thirds of freight traffic and four-fifths of&#13;
passenger traffic, while inland waterways serve about one-third and one-fifth, respectively,&#13;
and railways serve less than five percent of each. In contrast, in the Mekong Delta, inland&#13;
waterways carry 70-80 percent of freight traffic, whereas roads carry only 20-30 percent.&#13;

1.6    Roads. The country's roads are in poor condition and are deteriorating rapidly&#13;
due to increasing truck traffic and inadequate maintenance, which, together, are straining&#13;
the foundations and surfaces that were not designed for high-axle loads. According to a&#13;
1996 survey, only nine percent of national and provincial roads were considered in "good"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
condition, while 67 percent were "poor" or "very poor."3  Only 53 percent of the total&#13;
length (11,084 km) is paved. Based on World Bank estimates, actual expenditures on&#13;
road maintenance represent only 27 percent of the amount required. As a result, vehicle&#13;
operating costs are about 40-80 percent higher than for well-maintained roads.&#13;
1.7   Inland Waterways. Vietnam has 41,000 km of inland waterways extending tc&#13;
almost all populated areas and industrial zones. Of this amount, about one-quarter can&#13;
support year-round transport, and one tenth (4,000 kin) have sufficient drafts to carry&#13;
large commercial vessels.  Twenty-three major river ports handle bulk cargo and&#13;
numerous small, private facilities (typically landing stages or "gang-and-plank") handle&#13;
smaller loads.&#13;
1.8    Waterway capacity and safety have declined in recent years due to several factors,&#13;
including the silting of channels, inadequate navigation aids (navaids), sharp bends and&#13;
other obstacles. Severe silting has resulted from a dredging backlog estimated at 25&#13;
million cubic meters (10 million in the north and 15 million in the south)4. Inadequate&#13;
navaids make day navigation treacherous and night navigation unsafe for barge convoys.&#13;
The absence of night navaids has lowered fleet productivity by an estimated 40 percent or&#13;
more. Over 50 sharp bends in the southern waterways hamper the use of convoys in the&#13;
main waterway corridors.  Obstacles such as low  overhead clearances, encroaching&#13;
houses, shipwrecks, uncontrolled anchoring and fishing traps further impede navigation.&#13;
These factors have raised waterway transport costs and caused the inland waterways to be&#13;
underutilized.&#13;
1.9    Seaports. Vietnam has four international seaports (Saigon, Can Tho, Haiphong,&#13;
Danang) and about 30 other seaports.5 In general, port. operations are inadequate due to&#13;
obsolete facilities and antiquated cargo handling equipment. The Asian Development&#13;
Bank (ADB) and other bilateral donors are addressing these issues in Saigon and&#13;
Haiphong.&#13;
1.10 Railways. It is estimated that the 2,500-km rail network is about four times&#13;
larger than required. Its condition is unsatisfactory, several sections of track are subject to&#13;
flooding, and gauges differ between some provinces. Moreover, operating speeds are low&#13;
due to track, bridge and tunnel deterioration as well as the poor condition of rolling stock.&#13;
1.11   Airports. Vietnam has 18 airports, of which three are international (Hanoi, Ho&#13;
Chi Minh City, and Da Nang) and only six are served on a regular basis. Although air&#13;

Provincial Roads: Vietnam. January 1996.&#13;
4 To maintain a least-available depth (LAD) of 2.4 meters (standard for Vietnamese Class III&#13;
waterways), it is necessary to dredge about 2.5 million cubic meters each year (1.5 million cu.m. in the&#13;
north and I million in the south).&#13;
S These include seven national seaports, about 20 provincial/municipal seaports and a number of&#13;
specialized ports operated by the Ministries of Energy and Agriculture and by the Navy.&#13;

traffic is low, it is expanding at 30 percent a year. As a result, international airport&#13;
facilities in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) are becoming congested.&#13;
C.   TRANSPORT SECTOR INVESTMENT STRATEGY&#13;
1.12  To meet the anticipated growth in demand, Vietnam will need to ensure that its&#13;
key transport infrastructure is adequate.  Investments should therefore focus in the&#13;
medium term on restoring, modernizing and maintaining principal roads, waterways and&#13;
ports where demand is strong but deterioration poses serious bottlenecks. Once the&#13;
network has been improved to a condition that can be maintained, long-term investments&#13;
in regional road links, new ports and urban public transport could be considered. Such&#13;
investments will require a deeper understanding of the evolving demand for transport.&#13;
1.13  To identify priority investments, comprehensive studies have been carried out for&#13;
roads, urban transport, rail, inland waterways and other transport modes, as recommended&#13;
in a World Bank sector review.6 A road sector study financed by ODA developed a&#13;
medium-term investment strategy, and the government has already obtained financing&#13;
commitments from ADB, IDA and others for key investments in highways and rural roads.&#13;
An urban transport management study recommended investments in traffic management&#13;
and urban roads to accommodate the rapid growth in traffic; IDA is coordinating with&#13;
other donors to finance these investments. A railway study identified rail bridges and&#13;
tunnels that urgently need to be rehabilitated; it is expected these will be funded by OECF.&#13;
For the coastal shipping sector, JICA is helping VINAMARINE formulate a master plan.&#13;
To ensure sectoral and cross-sectoral coherence in the Government's overall development&#13;
program, UNDP reviewed public expenditures and donors have coordinated their efforts&#13;
in the sector. The following studies were completed and investments identified for the&#13;
inland waterways:&#13;
*  A Master Plan for the Mekong Delta sponsored by the Government, the&#13;
World Bank, the Mekong Commission and UNI)P7 helped identify the&#13;
proposed project covering priority investments for rehabilitating the main&#13;
inland waterways of the Mekong Delta as well as a regional port.&#13;
*  A similar study completed for the Red River Delta defined major commercial&#13;

D.    TRANSPORT REFORMS&#13;
1.14 In line with Doi Moi, important reforms have been undertaken in transport,&#13;
notably:&#13;
* Eliminating the allocation of cargo to specific modes;&#13;
* Liberalizing tariffs for road and inland waterway freight transport;&#13;
* Decentralizing fare-setting and route-allocation power for urban passenger&#13;
transport to the provincial People's Committees;&#13;
Lifting entry controls by easing licensing restrictions and allowing private&#13;
transport enterprises and own-account operators (including military) to&#13;
provide both cargo and passenger transport;&#13;
* Commercializing state transport enterprises and abolishing their direct&#13;
operating subsidies;&#13;
* Allowing the establishment of private transport enterprises and private&#13;
participation in transport infrastructure investment and operations;&#13;
*  Reorganizing the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOT) into&#13;
modal administrations; and&#13;
* Improving the cost recovery of state transport infrastructure.&#13;
E.    REMAINING CHALLENGES&#13;
1.15  These reforms will improve the efficiency of transport operations and are expected&#13;
to spur the growth of the private market for transport. Additional measures should be&#13;
taken to ensure adequate sector investment, strengthen the public institutions responsible&#13;
for providing fixed infrastructure, promote regulatory reforms to stimulate private sector&#13;
operations, and design pricing and taxation policies that will generate revenue and&#13;
efficiently allocate demand across modes. Specifically, the reform agenda for the next&#13;
decade should include the following:&#13;
*   Increasing annual capital expenditure for transport infrastructure to 2.5&#13;
percent of GDP in real terms;&#13;
*   Increasing operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) expenditures to about 0.6&#13;
percent of GDP (twice 1995 levels) and introducing modern maintenance and&#13;
management techniques;&#13;
*   Coordinating investment planning among various levels of government;&#13;
*  Privatizing commercially viable transport services (e.g., trucking, shipping,&#13;
port services);&#13;
*   Gradually eliminating remaining restrictions on entry and competition in&#13;
transport markets (including subsidies), and replacing them with a regulatory&#13;
framework and institutions;&#13;
*  Realigning transport user charges for commercial public services to fully&#13;
reflect their economic costs;&#13;
*   Continuing to strengthen transport institutions; and&#13;
* Modernizing transport training and upgrading skills.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -&#13;
1.16  The proposed project would introduce specific actions to support the above&#13;
measures in the inland waterways sector, including an increase in O&amp;M expenditures,&#13;
capital investment for the rehabilitation of commercial routes, capacity enhancement to&#13;
mainly promote commercial barge traffic, and strengthening of public institutions&#13;
responsible for sector management. In this endeavor, the Bank will continue to promote&#13;
the full cooperation of the active and interested donors (see para. 3.53).&#13;

2. INLAND WATERWAYS OF THE MEKONG DELTA&#13;
A.    BACKGROUND&#13;
2.1    The Mekong River Delta covers about 39,000 sq. km at the southern tip of&#13;
Vietnam (see Map). Eighty-five percent of its 16 million residents live in rural areas, with&#13;
an average density of about 400 inhabitants/sq. km in 1993 (varying from 193 inh./sq. km&#13;
in Kien Giang province to 660 inh./sq. km in Vinh Long province).&#13;
2.2    Most of the Delta's population is engaged in small-scale agriculture, with 63&#13;
percent of total land area under cultivation and average land holdings of about one&#13;
hectare. In recent years (1990-1994), the region has generated roughly one-quarter of the&#13;
nation's GDP, one-third of its agricultural production and half of its rice production. The&#13;
region's rice products contribute significantly to export earnings, accounting for 85&#13;
percent of Vietnamese rice exports in 1990.1 Upland crops such as soy and mung beans,&#13;
and perennial crops such as coconut, pineapple and sugarcane, also are cultivated in the&#13;
region, and aquaculture is increasing. Industrial activities include agro-processing (such as&#13;
sugar, rice mills and fisheries) and cement production (e.g., the Kien Luong Plant).&#13;

B.    INLAND WATERWAYS INFASTRUCTURE&#13;
2.3   Waterways. Inland waterways are the Delta's most important transport system.&#13;
Its 26,900 km of rivers, canals and irrigation channels reach virtually every settlement.&#13;
There are about 4,800 km of navigable routes of which 1,578 km have sufficient depth to&#13;
support commercial traffic (LAD of 2-4 m). The main rivers (Dong Nai, Mekong and&#13;
Bassac) can accommodate seagoing vessels up to 4.5 m draft under normal conditions.&#13;
The strength and direction of the currents change with the seasons and the tides (high&#13;
tides of up to 4.5 m amplitude enter twice a day from the Eastern/South China Sea and a&#13;
much weaker tide of 1 m amplitude enters once a day from the Gulf of Thailand). There is&#13;
a serious backlog in dredging, estimated at about 12 million cubic meters. The annual&#13;
maintenance dredging requirement is estimated at an average 1.5 million cubic meters.&#13;
2.4   Ports. Ten principal ports on the main rivers handle 2.6-2.8 million tons of bulk&#13;
cargo annually. The largest is Binh Dong in HCMC (0.5-0.7 million tons p.a.). The port&#13;
of Can Tho in the center of the Delta (see map) handles some 0.2 million tons p.a. and can&#13;
accommodate seagoing ships up to 10,000 dwt, whereas the other river ports can support&#13;
vessels of only 1,000-2,000 dwt. Small facilities serve the remainder of the region's cargo&#13;
traffic.&#13;
2.5   Navigation Aids. Navigation aids (navaids) are markers such as buoys, beacons&#13;
and lights which indicate shipping channels and obstacles. There is a severe shortage of&#13;
navaids in the region. Only about 400 navaids exist on the main shipping channels--one-&#13;
fifth of the number required for safe day and night navigation. Most navaids need&#13;
rehabilitation and none are lighted. As a result, day navigation is risky and night&#13;
navigation is dangerous.&#13;
2.6   Other Facilities and Equipment. More specialized vessels and equipment are&#13;
needed to manage and maintain the waterways. The effective dredging capacity is only&#13;
about 30 percent of the amount required, and the entire southern network has only two&#13;
motorized patrol boats, both outdated. A typical waterway maintenance station has only&#13;
one 5-dwt wooden boat, and no modern hydraulic and hydrographic measuring equipment&#13;
or dedicated communication system. Measurements are carried out using level rods and&#13;
lead line, and the antiquated local public telephone system is used for internal&#13;
communication.&#13;
C.   INLAND WATERWAYS TRANSPORT&#13;
2.7   Traffic. Freight traffic in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta consists primarily of bulk&#13;
commodity cargoes such as paddy, rice, cereal, fertilizers, construction materials, cement&#13;
and petroleum products. In 1994, inland waterways carried about 6.8 million tons of&#13;
freight traffic in the Delta, representing about 65 percent of the total recorded traffic in the&#13;
region (10.5 million tons). In addition, waterways carry a significant amount of informal&#13;
freight and passenger traffic. Agricultural products, construction materials and timber&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9 -&#13;
represent more than 80 percent of all commodities transported on these waterways.2&#13;
About three-quarters of recorded Mekong waterway freight had its origin or destination in&#13;
HCMC; about 17 percent consisted of imports or exports and less than 10 percent&#13;
comprised intra-Delta traffic. Two corridors carried 60 percent of waterway freight:&#13;
HCMC - Cho Lach - Kien Luong and Cho Lach - Can Tho- Ca Mau (see Map). Long-&#13;
haul cargo (about 70 percent) is predominantly transported by 50-150 dwt vessels.&#13;
2.8    Fleet.  The fleet capacity on the main waterways is estimated at some 500,000&#13;
dwt, of which the long-haul fleet accounts for about 220,000 dwt.3 The long-haul fleet&#13;
consists of barges (250-300 dwt; 47 percent of capacity), self-propelled wooden country&#13;
boats (50-150 dwt; 46 percent) and self-propelled steel vessels (200-600 dwt; 7 percent).&#13;
The conventional barge train consists of two or three 250-dwt barges pushed by a 200 HP&#13;
tug, with a draft of 2.20 meters4. Over one-third of fleet capacity is made up of self-&#13;
propelled vessels of about 60 dwt, with a draft similar to that of barges. The fleet is&#13;
generally old, dating to the 1970s, 1960s or earlier, and has shrunk steadily by some 3-5&#13;
percent per annum. Cargo transport has been operating at almost 80 percent of its&#13;
capacity, a relatively high figure that indicates capacity shortages could develop soon&#13;
unless the system is made more efficient.&#13;
2.9    The predominance of the artisanal mode in the south contrasts with that in the&#13;
north, where the prevailing mode of operation is industrial scale, in convoys of barges with&#13;
an average size of 200 dwt and a pusher tug.&#13;
2.10   Waterway fleets are operated by cooperative, state, provincial, and private bodies.&#13;
Cooperatives own the largest share, while state companies own about 20-30 percent. A&#13;
number of provinces also have fleets and passenger ferries which are controlled by&#13;
provincial MOT departments. Many river craft are privately and/or owner-operated. The&#13;
passenger fleet is mainly owned and operated by provincial administrations. Since 1989,&#13;
to encourage commercialization, greater autonomy has been granted to state and&#13;
provincial river freight transport companies and subsidies to state-owned shipping&#13;
companies have been eliminated, forcing them to seek private and foreign partners. In&#13;
addition, several cooperatives/state enterprises have been privatized since 1989.&#13;
2.11   Costs. Vessel operating costs on Delta waterways are estimated at about 2 to 4&#13;
US cents per ton-km5, which compares favorably with road transport costs (about 5 to 7&#13;
US cents per ton-km), particularly for long distances. This is consistent with international&#13;
estimates.&#13;

29.5%; timber and timber products, 9.5%; and fertilizer, 9.1%.&#13;

5 Barge convoys with average trip lengths exceeding 100 km would incur the lowest costs, while&#13;
convoys with short trip lengths or on canals in a poor state of repair (e.g., Xa No-Ca Mau) would&#13;
experience the highest costs. Self-propelled vessels are in between, with a 10-15 percent cost advantage&#13;
over barge convoys on short distances and a cost disadvantage on long distances. Source: NEDECO, ibid.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

D.   INSTITuTIONAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
2.12 Policy and Oversight. The Vietnam Inland Waterways Administration (VIWA)&#13;
was established in 1993 under MOT to oversee inland waterways, river ports and shipping&#13;
(see organization chart, Annex 1, Figure Al. 1).6 VIWA is responsible for formulating and&#13;
administering sector policies and regulations; planning and funding waterway&#13;
infrastructure investments; and overseeing waterway safety and training. While VIWA has&#13;
independent legal status, its own budget and accounts with the State Treasury, its&#13;
autonomy is limited in that: (a) it reports to MOT; (b) its budget is reviewed by MOT and&#13;
approved by the Prime Minister; and (c) its chief executive is appointed by the chairman of&#13;
the Council of Ministers on the recommendation of the Minister of Transport.&#13;
2.13 MOT has established a Project Management Unit of Southern Waterways (PMU-&#13;
SW) to manage foreign-financed development projects for the main waterways (HCMC-&#13;
Cho Lach-Kien Loung and Cho Lach-Ca Mau). The Unit consists of five sections&#13;
(Technical, Planning, Administration and Organization, Finances, and Resettlement,&#13;
including Environment). Its Director General has been seconded from VIWA and is&#13;
supported by a Deputy Director General and 28 staff. PMU-SW reports to MOT and&#13;
VIWA.&#13;
2.14 Waterway Operations and Maintenance. VIWA has sole responsibility for the&#13;
administration, management, maintenance, standards and safety of state-controlled&#13;
waterways and, with MOT oversight, for planning, designing and implementing all major&#13;
capital works.&#13;
2.15  VIWA delegates its duties related to maintenance, enforcement, and routine&#13;
operations and management of the Mekong Delta waterways to the Vietnam Inland&#13;
Waterways Administration/Southern Department (VIWA/SD), established in 1993 and&#13;
situated in HCMC.' VIWA/SD manages about 2,327 km of rivers and canals in the south,&#13;
including the project waterways.  It also is responsible for: regulating waterborne&#13;
transport and facilities (in cooperation with central authorities); enforcing rules and&#13;
regulations pertaining to the waterways; issuing permitsAicenses for vessels; and&#13;
maintaining, imnproving and developing river transport infrastructure.&#13;
2.16 Responsibility for operations and management is subdivided into geographical&#13;
divisions, of which there are five in the Mekong Delta. Each division supervises 4-5&#13;
stations, which perform day-to-day functions such as waterway inspection (cargo, crew,&#13;
etc.), traffic enforcement, routine checks and monitoring of water levels, navaids,&#13;
obstructions, pollution, etc., and public communications.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
2.17  Plans for annual maintenance dredging and salvage and clearance of obstacles are&#13;
prepared by VIWA/SD staff and submitted to VIWA and MOT for review and clearance.&#13;
Once approved, MOF appropriates the funds to VIWA/SD for further distribution to its&#13;
subsidiary entities.&#13;
2.18 VIWA/SD has a staff of about 330, including 29 professionals at its central office&#13;
in HCMC. A typical area division is staffed by 14 persons; a typical station, by 8 persons.&#13;
2.19 The ability of VIWA/SD and its subsidiaries.to perform effectively is hampered by&#13;
lack of modem equipment, facilities and trained staff. Even core functions such as channel&#13;
verification, supervision of riparian structures, law enforcement, search and rescue, and&#13;
public updates on conditions, are carried out in a rudimentary fashion.&#13;
2.20  Dredging.  Dredging activities in Vietnam  are overseen by three entities:&#13;
(a) Vietnam Waterway Construction Corporation (VINAWACO), a state company under&#13;
MOT consisting of three separate companies; (b) Dredging Company No. 1 and&#13;
DRECONT under the Ministry of Water Resources; and (c) VIETDREDGE, a joint&#13;
venture between all Vietnamese dredging companies and the Netherlands Port and Delta&#13;
Consortium. These companies are considered financially autonomous and are permitted to&#13;
compete for public tenders. Each company has the capacity to undertake over five million&#13;
cubic meters per year of dredging.  In anticipation of an increase in capital and&#13;
maintenance dredging, these companies recently began to overhaul their dredging fleets.&#13;
2.21   State Enterprises in the Sector. VIWA administers two groups of state-owned&#13;
companies in the waterways sector: one in the north (Union of Enterprises No. 1) and a&#13;
second in the south (Union of Enterprises No. 2). The southern group includes a river&#13;
transport company, three shipyards, one river port, a workshop and a navigation training&#13;
center. Provincial authorities also manage a few companies, and some government&#13;
ministries and state-owned enterprises have their own fleets and ports. In addition, there&#13;
are several state-owned sea-and-river transport companies.&#13;
2.22  Supporting Institutions.   There are several institutions and facilities under&#13;
VIWA that support the staff needs of sector agencies, including two inland navigation&#13;
schools, one of which, situated in HCMC, serves southern Vietnam. After years of&#13;
neglect and under-funding, the transport training schools have inadequate facilities; as a&#13;
result, under 10 percent of river pilots in the south have pilot certificates. To help meet&#13;
training needs, the Government of Vietnam (GOV) is seeking bilateral assistance from&#13;
various sources.&#13;
2.23  Other transport sector organizations include the Service of Maritime Safety&#13;
(SMS), part of MOT's maritime department, which is responsible for the operation of&#13;
seaport access channels, and the Transport Development Strategy Institute (TDSI), a&#13;
MOT institute for socioeconomic research.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
2.24 Sector Revenues and Expenditures. The inland waterway sector generates two&#13;
main types of revenues: fuel taxes and registration fees. Fuel taxes include a 15 percent&#13;
diesel tax collected at the pump8 and a transport surcharge of VND 300 per liter on diesel&#13;
fuel.9 Fuel taxes are set uniformly for all modes of transport. They are collected by the&#13;
Ministry of Finance (MOF) and applied to the general budget. Registration fees, set and&#13;
collected by VIWA, are levied on river craft of 5 dwt or more. 10 A regional breakdown of&#13;
these revenues is not available but they are estimated at about VND 25 billion (US$2.3&#13;
million) from inland waterway transport in the Mekong Delta, including VND 24 billion&#13;
(US$2.2 million) from the diesel tax in 1994.&#13;
2.25  Expenditures are budgeted through the central government's normal procedures.&#13;
VIWA prepares both recurrent and capital budgets under MOT's guidance. The recurrent&#13;
budget is reviewed by the MOF and the capital budget by the Ministry of Planning and&#13;
Investment (MPI), prior to the MOF and the Office of the Government's final approval.&#13;
2.26  The provincial departments of MOT are funded entirely by the central government.&#13;
Although sector revenues appear adequate to fund operations and maintenance, budget&#13;
allocations have been insufficient. A breakdown of sector expenditures and budgets for&#13;
VIWA and for VIWA/SD is provided in Annex 1.&#13;
E.    CAN THo PORT&#13;
2.27  Can Tho Port is located in the center of the Delta and 70 km upstream from the&#13;
mouth of the Bassac River. Its main business is transshipping bulk cargoes, primarily rice&#13;
and paddy, from small vessels to barges. In its present state, the port has a throughput&#13;
capacity of about 250,000 tons per annum. Its throughput reached 200,000 tons in 1996&#13;
and demand is expected to exceed capacity by the year 2000. The Government recently&#13;
designated the port as an international seaport and plans to develop it as a regional hub.&#13;
However, the port's ability to carry seagoing traffic is limited by (a) silting of the Bassac&#13;
River channel leading to the Eastern/South China sea (which limits ship drafts);&#13;
(b) impending throughput constraints of the port itself, (c) a lack of commercial&#13;
orientation; (d) poor financial management; and (e) constraints on the marketing and&#13;
exportation of rice, which hamper the full realization of the port's comparative advantage&#13;
(Annex 1 1, page 7). An ongoing study seeks to determine the feasibility of a sustainable&#13;
solution which might permit Can Tho Port to attract traffic from the congested ports of&#13;
HCMC. In addition, the proposed project includes investments to preserve port capacity&#13;
as well as assistance to promote private participation and improved commercial and&#13;
financial management (paras. 3.15 to 3.18).&#13;
8 Decision 542 TC/QD/TCT of July 1, 1996.&#13;
9 Decree No. 186-CP of December 7, 1994. This replaced channel fees.&#13;
10 Decision No. 1032/QD.KHKE/TCKT of July 4, 1994, issued by MOT. There are two&#13;
components: (a) annual fees of VND 800 (US$.08) per dwt and (b) a first-time registration fee ranging&#13;
from VND 1,450 per dwt (for vessels over 100 dwt) to VND 1,650 per dwt (for vessels up to 20 dwt).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
2.28  Can Tho Port Enterprise, a state-owned business entity", is responsible for the&#13;
operation and maintenance of the Port. The Port has 13 managerial staff to cover&#13;
operations, finance, ship services, maintenance and personnel functions. However, key&#13;
commercial functions such as marketing, financial planning and plant management are not&#13;
staffed. The existing financial reporting system is inadequate for port management;&#13;
however, a new financial accounting system will be introduced this year.&#13;
F.    KEY ISSUES&#13;
2.29 Restoration of System Capacity and Efficiency. The three key components of&#13;
the Mekong waterways system - waterways, fleet and cargo handling - require immediate&#13;
attention. Otherwise, their capacity constraints will affect the regional and national&#13;
economy and divert significant traffic to higher-cost roads. For long-haul bulk traffic,&#13;
waterways remain the most economical, energy-efficient and environmentally desirable&#13;
mode of transportation. Hence, the need for sustaining the desired balance between road&#13;
and waterways use is critical in the Mekong Delta.&#13;
Waterways: Chronic neglect of dredging in rivers and canals, inadequate navaids&#13;
and other impediments to navigation have led to under-utilization, rising unit transport&#13;
costs and declining safety of inland waterways. The Government is determined to reverse&#13;
this trend. This will require: (a) eliminating the dredging backlog; (b) preparing main&#13;
routes for the use of large vessels and barges, including canal widening, maintenance of&#13;
required water depth, overhead clearances, provision of locks for navigation and&#13;
attenuating sharp bends; (c) improving navaids for safe day and night operations; and&#13;
(d) improving waterway operations through modernization of equipment, better&#13;
enforcement of rules and adequate navigation information. The proposed project is&#13;
designed to address these requirements (see Component A in Chapter 3).&#13;
Fleet Modernization: The existing fleet is operating at its maximum carrying&#13;
capacity. The fleet capacity required for the projected cargo demand of 7.3 million tons in&#13;
the year 2000 exceeds current capacity by about 80,000 dwt. The present project will&#13;
increase the productivity of the existing fleet by permitting night navigation and reducing&#13;
travel time. Moreover, it will offer indirect incentives to operators to renew and/or&#13;
expand the fleet. The proposed expansion of waterway capacity and improved operations&#13;
will permit the use of larger vessels that will more efficiently meet the emerging demand&#13;
for long haul bulk freight in the Delta. Since restrictions on entry have been lifted, new&#13;
vessel owners or operators will be attracted, and new joint venture companies may enter&#13;
the barge business.&#13;
Cargo Handling: Despite physical constraints on larger seagoing vessels, Can Tho&#13;
Port's prime location shows potential to handle substantial Delta traffic while restraining&#13;
traffic diversion to HCMC ports. In order to maintain and expand its role, Can Tho Port&#13;
needs to improve cargo handling efficiency while adopting commercial business practices.&#13;
"Decision No. 1393/QD-UBT92 of the Can Tho Province, Nov. 28, 1992, and Decision No.&#13;
1828/KH DT of the MOT, Sept. 17, 1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
The proposed project will address critical needs in these areas in tandem with on-going&#13;
reforms in the sector (paras. 3.15-3.18).&#13;
2.30  Sustaining Adequate Maintenance. Recognizing the importance of operations&#13;
and maintenance, the Government increased its recurrent expenditures six-fold from 1991&#13;
to 1995, from VND 2 million (US$184) per km to VND 12.9 million (US$1,169) per km.&#13;
However, this amount is still far short of the approximately US$2,000 per year per km&#13;
that is needed (see Annex 1). The Government is committed to addressing this issue in&#13;
conjunction with the implementation of the project (para. 4.25).&#13;
2.31  A competitive, reliable and stable dredging industry is essential to regular&#13;
maintenance activities. The domestic dredging industry has shown positive signs of&#13;
development in recent years (para. 2.20). The increase in maintenance expenditures and&#13;
the implementation of major waterways rehabilitation projects (including this project and&#13;
the future ADB project in the north) will offer the domestic dredging industry an&#13;
opportunity to flourish through an infusion of capital in new equipment and transfer of&#13;
know-how via joint ventures.&#13;
2.32 Human Resource Management and Development. VIWA and VIWA/SD are&#13;
under-staffed, under-trained and lack the necessary equipment for efficient waterway&#13;
management; they cannot adequately carry out their assigned responsibilities.  In&#13;
particular, additional staff needs to be recruited and trained in areas including contracting;&#13;
dredging (planning and supervision), environmental and resettlement monitoring, soil and&#13;
water sampling, civil works supervision, operation and maintenance of navaids, and&#13;
waterway administration (including planning, programming and budgeting techniques).&#13;
The project will begin to address skill-building needs in the priority areas listed above&#13;
(paras. 3.19 and 3.22, and Annex 3). Moreover, it will perrnit the Bank to coordinate&#13;
future efforts of interested bilateral donors. CIDA has already approached the Bank with&#13;
the design of a technical assistance program for promoting commercial management and&#13;
operations practices in VIWA.&#13;
G.   LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
2.33  Lessons from Previous IDA Projects. This project is the first in the Vietnamese&#13;
inland waterways sector. IDA experience with other projects in Vietnam is still limited,&#13;
but a recent Country Implementation Review identified three areas of incipient problems:&#13;
(a) non-codified procurement procedures, as government procedures are cumbersome and&#13;
agencies are unfamiliar with Bank guidelines; (b) allocation of counterpart funds; and&#13;
(c) resettlement policy. Recent experience with the implementation of the Highway&#13;
Rehabilitation Project (Credit 2549-VN) shows that a multi-layered bureaucracy and over-&#13;
centralized decision-making slow  implementation further.  In general, government&#13;
agencies lack familiarity with IDA procedures, have inadequate legislation and practices&#13;
(particularly in procurement and resettlement) and suffer from scarcity of funds and&#13;
experienced staff.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
2.34  Various cross-sector and sector-specific initiatives by bilateral and multilateral&#13;
donors (such as assistance with drafting legislation on procurement, resettlement and other&#13;
matters) and the reforms planned or undertaken by the Government will begin to resolve&#13;
these issues. However, it is clear that it will take time for Vietnam to develop its project&#13;
absorption capacity in specific sectors.&#13;
2.35   The proposed project will benefit from these initiatives and will initiate capacity&#13;
building for project formulation and implementation in the inland waterways sector.&#13;
2.36 Lessons from Bank Experience. Bank experience in inland waterways projects&#13;
in Asia (Bangladesh, China, Myanmar and Thailand) suggests that the viability of inland&#13;
waterway projects depends critically on the waterways' ability to maintain a comparative&#13;
advantage over competing modes of transport and thus promote waterway use. This, in&#13;
turn, depends on three criteria: (a) maintaining adequate drafts by managing water use&#13;
and navigation aids to accommodate vessels; (b) retaining a cost advantage over trucking;&#13;
and (c) attracting bulk traffic that is not time-sensitive. Moreover, these projects have&#13;
indicated the need for technical assistance to improve the imnplementation and supervision&#13;
capabilities. These requirements have been met by the project design and the proposed&#13;
implementation arrangements (Chapter 3).&#13;
H.   RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.37  IDA's Country Assistance Strategy for Vietnam (CAS, discussed at the Board on&#13;
October 25, 1995; and a progress report reviewed by the Executive Directors on&#13;
December 23, 1996) promotes investment in key infrastructure to support broad-based,&#13;
sustainable development and poverty reduction. The country's dilapidated and obsolete&#13;
infrastructure, including transport, has been identified by the Government, IDA and&#13;
private investors as a critical constraint to rapid, sustained and geographically broad-&#13;
based economic development. IDA's strategy in the Vietnamese transport sector is to&#13;
assist in rehabilitating the basic transport network, promoting regulatory reform and&#13;
strengthening the public sector institutions responsible for infrastructure provision and&#13;
management.&#13;
2.38  The proposed project is consistent with these strategies and fulfills the&#13;
recommendations of the Mekong Delta Master Plan. The project supports the urgent&#13;
need for the restoration of two key existing waterway routes in the Mekong region to&#13;
maintain a balanced use of road and waterway transport modes while promoting economic&#13;
growth in a largely rural, poor region. Improving waterways will open the region to&#13;
economic activities (mainly agribusiness and trade), improve its access to the country's&#13;
largest city (HCMC) and the region's central port (Can Tho), and promote exports from&#13;
the region to international markets. Furthermore, by promoting the most econoniic,&#13;
energy-efficient and environmentally desirable mode of transporting low-value, bulk&#13;
cargoes, the project will benefit public and private vessel operators as well as farmers in&#13;
terms of reduced transport costs and resulting gains in fleet productivity. Thus, the&#13;
project will form a critical element in the Bank's efforts to help Government improve the&#13;
living conditions of the rural population and promote private-sector activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
2.39  Because this is the first donor-assisted major project in the sector, IDA has been&#13;
instrumental in transferring know-how about project identification and development,&#13;
including the technical design and evaluation of related economic, social and&#13;
environmental aspects. The project is a prototype of the comprehensive package of&#13;
actions and improvements required to modernize inland waterways. Furthermore, through&#13;
the project, IDA will support the introduction of modem technology and implementation&#13;
of efficient methods of waterway management and operations (through training and&#13;
technical assistance).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A.   PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.1   The project's general objective is to enhance the capacity, efficiency and safety of&#13;
inland waterway transport in the Mekong Delta. Its specific objectives are to:&#13;
(a)  Enhance the safety and traffic carrying capacity of the two main inland&#13;
waterway routes connecting the Mekong Delta with HCMC;&#13;
(b)  Rehabilitate and improve the Port of Can Tho to improve the efficiency of&#13;
cargo transshipment and distribution; and&#13;
(c)  Improve the institutions involved so they can better plan, administer, operate&#13;
and maintain the inland waterway system in the Mekong Delta.&#13;
3.2   Performance Indicators. To measure the project's performance with regard to&#13;
these objectives, the following indicators will be monitored annually during&#13;
implementation and after completion: (a) increase in average daily cargo traffic at selected&#13;
locations along the project waterways; (b) increase in throughput of the Can Tho Port;&#13;
(c) financial performance of Can Tho Port, in terms of increased operating profits; and&#13;
(d) staff-weeks of training and the number of VIWA and VIWA/SD staff trained under the&#13;
project (Annex 2). In addition, a set of indicators has been defined to measure progress&#13;
on project works (Annex 7B), resettlement activities (Annex 4) and environmental impact&#13;
mitigation (Annex 5).   Monitoring will also establish the progress of project&#13;
implementation and effectiveness.&#13;
B.    PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.3   To achieve these objectives, the project will comprise three components:&#13;
(a) Waterway Improvements (US$56.3 million; 82 percent of base costs); (b) Can Tho&#13;
Port Improvements (US$1.56 million; two percent of base costs); and (c) Institution&#13;
Building (US$10.65 million; 16 percent of base costs).&#13;
Component A: Waterway Improvements&#13;
3.4   This component will improve the two main inland waterway routes of the Mekong&#13;
Delta, which total 546 km (see map). These two routes are: (a) HCMC to Kien Luong in&#13;
the northwest, via Cho Gao, Cho Lach, Sa Dec, Lap Vo and Rach Gia; and (b) Cho Lach&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
to Ca Mau in the southwest via Mang Thit, Can Tho, Xa No and Thoi Binh. The&#13;
improvements will permit safe daytime and nighttime, year-round, two-way navigation;&#13;
depth and air clearances will accommodate the design convoy consisting of three 300-dwt&#13;
barges.1&#13;
3.5   Component A-1: Dredging. The two main waterway routes will be widened and&#13;
deepened through excavation and dredging (250 kin). The least available depth (LAD)&#13;
will be a minimum of 2.7 meters at lowest low water level (LLWL). The lowest width will&#13;
vary from 22 to 30 meters based on projected traffic density as shown below:&#13;
*   HCMC to Cho Gao (69.5 km) will have a minimum width of 30 meters,&#13;
conforming to the requirements of a Class III canal under Vietnamese&#13;
standards;&#13;
*   Cho Gao to Cho Lach (42.3 km), largely along the northern branch of the&#13;
Mekong River (Pha Rach Mieu), will maintain a minimum width of 30&#13;
meters;&#13;
*   Cho Gao via Sa Dec, Lap Vo and Rach Gia to Kien Luong (216.2 km) will&#13;
maintain a minimum width of 26 meters;&#13;
*   Cho Lach via Mang Thit to Can Tho (84.8 km), a heavily traveled section,&#13;
will also be widened, where needed, to a minimum width of 26 meters; and&#13;
*   Can Tho via Xa No to Ca Mau (133.6 km), which has less traffic, will have a&#13;
minimum width of 22 meters (however, provisions will be made for future&#13;
widening to 26 meters once the traffic level justifies it by acquiring sufficient&#13;
right-of-way).&#13;
3.6   To avoid major resettlement and related costs within the densely populated town&#13;
of Rach Gia, an 8 km canal bypassing the town will be built (see map), which will meet the&#13;
same standards as the existing canals to which it will connect. To improve safety and&#13;
navigation, nine bends with insufficient radii (less than 300 m) will be improved (see map),&#13;
and river training works will be carried out at four intersections of canals with the Bassac&#13;
River at Lap Vo, Cai San, Tra On and Can Tho, at the Mekong River and the Sa Dec&#13;
canal, and at the confluence of the Mekong and Mang Thit Rivers (see map). To abate&#13;
dangerous cross-currents and reduce the velocity of water flow at three canal confluences&#13;
along the Rach Gia to Kien Luong section of the waterway (see map), these canal&#13;
intersections will be widened and deepened.&#13;
3.7   Canal widening will require dredging of approximately 10 million m3 of material&#13;
using cutter suction dredgers, grab dredgers and barges. The method of dredging,&#13;
disposal and environmental treatment will depend on the type of soil dredged (para. 3.28).&#13;
Delta soils consist predominantly of Holocene marine sediments, of which some of the&#13;
brackish water and marine sediments contain potentially pyritic or Acid Sulfate Soil&#13;
(ASS); particularly along the Rach Gia-Ha Tien canal and the Xa No, Tat Cay Tram and&#13;
I The design vessel is a three unit towing convoy consisting of a 200 BP (=150 kW) tug with a&#13;
draft of 2.20 m, towing three barges of 300 dwt, each with a width of 8.5 m, length of 38 m and draft of&#13;
1.6 m. The total length of the convoy is approximately 140 m and design speed is 8.5 km/hr.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19-&#13;
Trem Canh Den canal sections. When it is dredged, ASS material requires special&#13;
treatment in order to minimize the release of acid when exposed to air. All dredged&#13;
material will be placed in areas contained by dikes (about 2 to 2.5 m high) with drainage&#13;
facilities. Special environmental measures will be taken for the containment, treatment and&#13;
monitoring of ASS (para. 3.28). Adequate arrangements have been made for selecting&#13;
disposal sites and compensating farmers for any loss of crops or land (paras. 3.33-3.36).&#13;
3.8   Component A-2: Bridge Improvements. To permit safe and efficient two-way&#13;
passage for vessels at high water, the bridges along the waterways should provide a&#13;
minimum of 30 m horizontal and 7 m vertical clearances. All new bridges will adopt these&#13;
standards. Of the existing bridges, 10 have substandard clearances. With suitable&#13;
navigation aids, three could accommodate some traffic growth but at slow speeds. Five&#13;
bridges will be replaced or improved (at Sa Dec, Kien Luong, Trinh Huu Ngia, Vinh&#13;
Thuan and Doan Ket; see map). The remaining two will be demolished due to their close&#13;
proximity to other bridges (Cai San and Thoi Binh).&#13;
3.9   Component A-3: Slope Protection.  The basic canal profile will have a&#13;
trapezoidal shape with vegetation on wet berms to provide aquatic habitats and stable side&#13;
slopes. Side slopes will be placed at an angle varying from the equivalent of 1 vertical to 2&#13;
horizontal (1:2) to 1 vertical to 3.5 horizontal (1:3.5) depending on the type and strength&#13;
of the excavated soil and the likelihood of vehicle or other loading activities being placed&#13;
adjacent to them. The project will treat canal side slopes where needed (about 10 km)&#13;
with proper surfacing materials (riprap, reno mattress and gabions) to afford stability and&#13;
prevent erosion caused by rainfall, currents or waves.&#13;
3. 10 Component A-4: Navigation Aids. To ensure safe day and night navigation in&#13;
two directions, the existing system of navigation aids (navaids) will be rehabilitated and&#13;
new navaids will be installed for the following waterways: (a) HCMC to Cho Lach;&#13;
(b) Cho Lach to Kien Luong; (c) Cho Lach to Ca Mau; and (d) the Bassac River between&#13;
Can Tho and Cai San. The proposed navaid system integrates a maritime buoyage system&#13;
for main sea-going routes (LALA based) and the SIGNI-based markings for the inland&#13;
waterways. The navaids will consist of large and small light buoys, high and low beacons,&#13;
canal bank lights, bridge and pier lights and appropriate channel, bank, shoal and&#13;
obstruction markers and instruction signs.&#13;
3.11  Component A-5: Landing Stage and Relocation of Markets. Extending the&#13;
improved Xa No waterway section into the densely-populated area of the town of Ca Mau&#13;
would have serious implications in terms of cost, environment and resettlement. Because&#13;
distributing goods from Ca Mau would require that they be transferred to trucks in any&#13;
case, the canal improvements will stop at the town's outer limits, and a landing stage&#13;
(cargo transfer facility) of 100 m by 20 m will be constructed at this location, with&#13;
berthing, mooring and apron facilities and an access road (see map).&#13;
3.12 Markets located on the waterways in Cai San and Vi Thanh (see map) pose a&#13;
hazard to river traffic. These markets will be relocated to suitable nearby sites away from&#13;
the main navigation channel.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
,,i    Component A-6: Navigation Lock. The Government (Ministry of Agriculture)&#13;
to build an anti-salinity weir at Thoi Binh (near Ca Mau) to limit salinity intrusion&#13;
io the Mekong Delta (see map). As this weir would have obstructed waterway traffic, a&#13;
'oX- approximately 14.5 meters wide and 117.0 meters long, with a pedestrian overpass,&#13;
b co.nstructed to both limit salinity intrusion and permit the passage of barge convoys&#13;
.d fom Ca Mau.&#13;
314 Component A-7: Land Acquisition and Resettlement. Dredging works will&#13;
require resettling people living in areas to be widened and the disposal of dredged soil.&#13;
Residents affected will be resettled and/or compensated according to an agreed&#13;
T"eCsettlement Action Plan (RAP) (see paras. 3.33-3.36).&#13;
oannponent B: Can Tho Port Improvement&#13;
1.   Under this component, Can Tho port will be rehabilitated to support the&#13;
ar ricipated growth in cargo over the next five years.&#13;
3A65 Comiponent B-1: Infrastructure. Port infrastructure improvements will consist&#13;
of: replacing the existing fenders with an improved system along the berth (144 m) and&#13;
,provRing for the collection of vessel bilge water and any chemical spills.&#13;
3.17  Component B-2: Equipment. To improve cargo flow and reduce waiting time,&#13;
the project will also provide to the Can Tho Port Enterprise cargo handling equipment&#13;
ir..uding one 40-ton mobile crane, six 40-foot trailers and two yard tractors.&#13;
.  Component B-3: Strengthening of Port Management. Consultant services and&#13;
s    -raining will be provided to the Can Tho Port Enterprise in the areas of marketing,&#13;
ia-71cial management, business development and port management (see outline terms of&#13;
-erence, Annex 3A).&#13;
, 'nponent C: Institution Building&#13;
3 1 C  Tinder this component, equipment and technical assistance, including training, will&#13;
.    nrovided to VIWA/SD and PMU-SW  to ensure timely and satisfactory project&#13;
.paementation and to improve waterway operations and maintenance.&#13;
3.20 Component C-1: Equipment for Waterway Operations and Maintenance.&#13;
irnprove waterway maintenance, policing and safety, VIWA/SD will receive five&#13;
buyge vessels, five large patrol boats, 20 small speed boats and one salvage boat. To&#13;
°.,  Rn r maintenance and environmental monitoring during and after project&#13;
-, eying and sampling equipment/instrumentation will be provided to&#13;
I ti-    3i.   a,dr PMU-SW. To improve maintenance and repair of navaids, workshop&#13;
oi zu pnent, machinery and tools will be furnished to VIWA/SD's navaids workshop in&#13;
HCMIC. Finally, to ensure effective management of project waterways, office and&#13;
conaunications equipment (radio communications, computers, fax machines, printers,&#13;
etc.) and four pick-up trucks will be provided to VIWA/SD.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
3.21   Component C-2: Waterway Management. Specialists will be engaged t6o amEr-&#13;
VIWAISD to develop staff skills in waterway management including dredging, navaids&#13;
maintenance, and traffic enforcement and safety.&#13;
3.22  Component C-3: Project Implementation and Management.  PMU-SWJ -&#13;
engage consultants to help them carry out procurement (including tender docurneS:&#13;
preparation, contractor pre-qualification, bid evaluation and contract award), disbursemeh L5&#13;
applications and arrangements, project supervision and quality control for all works,&#13;
goods and services to be procured under the project (see outline terms of reference,&#13;
Annex 3B). Funding will also be provided to PMU-SW for its daily operations includ&amp;ng&#13;
administration, transport, and technical advisory services for the monitoeing of&#13;
environmental and resettlement activities.&#13;
C.    PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
3.23   Total project cost is estimated at US$84.9 million equivalent (including taxes,&#13;
duties and contingencies) of which the foreign exchange cost is US$41.4 ni.,.o;.&#13;
equivalent or 49 percent of the total. Costs have been estimated at June i997 prices Frnfd&#13;
at an exchange rate of US$1.00 is equal to 11,600 Vietnamese Dong.  Phy sica.&#13;
contingencies were estimated at 10 percent of the base cost of civil works. Duties ald;&#13;
taxes, including consultants' taxes (to be borne by the Borrower) are estimated to be&#13;
US$4.0 million equivalent. Price contingencies have been calculated on the basis tif&#13;
expected rates of foreign and local inflation. Foreign inflation is estimated as 2.3 percen^f.&#13;
per annum in the period 1997-2002, and local inflation is estimated as 7.0 percent in. 199&#13;
and 6.0 percent per annum through 1998-2002. On the basis of implementation over -&#13;
years (1998-2002), price contingencies are estimated at 16 percent of base costs -p-;&#13;
physical contingencies. Table 3.1 present summary project costs and Annex 4 conriaL 2&#13;
detailed cost estimates for each of the project components.&#13;
3.24  The proposed IDA credit of US$73.0 million equivalent would cover albout - ;&#13;
percent of total project costs (90 percent of project costs net of duties and taxes). T l7e&#13;
Government of Vietnam is expected to fund US$11.9 million equivalent (14 percen-&#13;
project costs). During negotiations, Government agreement was obtained on the adequ.a.ie&#13;
and timely provision of the necessary counterpart funds (para. 5.1 (b)).&#13;
3.25  For the Can Tho Port component, the Government of Vietnam will relend par+-&#13;
the proceeds for equipment (US$1.1 million) to Can Tho Port Enterprise, at a conmercia'&#13;
rate. As civil works represent the deferred maintenance which currently affects the K ;,&#13;
safety and environmental aspects of the port, out of the proceeds of the JIDA&#13;
US$0.5 million for civil works will be made available to Can Tho Port Enterpl se as..&#13;
grant. The IDA credit will also support the technical assistance (US$0.16 millios) to  ,&#13;
made available to Can Tho Port Enterprise as a grant. If bilateral grants can be securee.&#13;
for the technical assistance, the proceeds of the credit earmarked for technical assistK a&#13;
will be canceled or reallocated to finance other expenditures under the project, if need be.&#13;

D.   ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
3.26  This is a Category A project. An environmental assessment (EA) was carried out&#13;
in July 1996 for the Waterway Improvements Component and an environmental analysis&#13;
was conducted for the Can Tho Port Component.&#13;
3.27 Impacts. For the Waterway Improvements Component, the key short-term&#13;
impacts would be: (a) disturbing habitats along canal banks; (b) increasing the acidity of&#13;
canal water due to the excavation of pyritic soil; and (c) re-suspending polluted sediments.&#13;
These factors could adversely affect agriculture, fisheries, and other aquatic life. The&#13;
medium- and long-term impacts may include: (a) erosion of canal banks, and (b) increased&#13;
salinity in coastal areas due to higher water flows. However, the increased water flow will&#13;
also improve water quality in areas where pollution is caused by organic compounds and&#13;
nutrients. For the Can Tho Port, the major impact would be an increase in ship wastes.&#13;
3.28  Mitigation. Major measures  during  implementation  of the  Waterway&#13;
Improvements Component would include:&#13;
(a)  Dredging those areas severely affected by pyritic soils during the wet season&#13;
when canal flow is at its highest, thereby diluting the acid and metal ion&#13;
releases into the canal water as much as possible;&#13;
(b)  Dredging only on one side, which would leave the biota on the opposite side&#13;
relatively untouched;&#13;
(c)  To the extent possible, selecting areas to deposit the dredged spoil that have&#13;
been previously used for this purpose. Confined disposal facilities (CDF)&#13;
would be located at suitable sites selected by the PMU-SW, Provincial&#13;
Departments of Science, Technology and Environment (PDSTE), and local&#13;
People's Committees. The CDF's would be engineered with surrounding&#13;
channels to direct run-off and any seepage water back to the canals;&#13;
(d) Developing a monitoring program which would identify any adverse impacts&#13;
to fisheries and aquatic life, for which guidance standards have been&#13;
provided, and which would lead to adjusting dredging methods;&#13;
(e)  Restoring canal banks in high erosion areas and VIWA/SD would regularly&#13;
maintain them; and&#13;
(f)  Controlling potential increases in salinity intrusion, (in areas where the&#13;
greatest adverse impact to agriculture could occur), by establishing salinity&#13;
weirs or other structures designed not to inhibit fish migrations through&#13;
them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
3.29 The major mitigation and improvement measures during implementation of the Can&#13;
Tho Port component would include:&#13;
(a)  Installing an oil separator for ships' oily bilge water to comply with&#13;
international MARPOL conventions;&#13;
(b)  Provisions to collect any spills of toxic chemicals at the Port;&#13;
(c)  Capacity to manage additional solid wastes generated from increased ship&#13;
and road traffic serving the Port for disposal at Can Tho municipal facilities;&#13;
and&#13;
(d) Muffling noise from equipment operation to meet national standards.&#13;
3.30 An Environmental Management Action Plan (EMAP) dated August, 1997,&#13;
specifies the actions, monitoring indicators and institutional arrangements required to&#13;
mitigate potential environmental impacts during the construction and operations.&#13;
Administrative arrangements have also been established between PMU-SW, contractors&#13;
and local authorities (including local NGOs and provincial PCs dealing with environmental&#13;
issues) to ensure that all required environmental mitigation actions would be implemented.&#13;
Specifically, the contractor will be responsible for transporting, preparing the sites and&#13;
carrying out environmental mitigation actions for all dredged material, and will be&#13;
monitored by PMU-SW, the Science, Technology and Environment agency of the&#13;
People's Committees (PCs) and the Environmental Protection Center (EPC) in HCMC, an&#13;
independent environmental monitoring agency.  EPC will regularly report on the&#13;
environmental status based on site visits, public consultations, water and soil core&#13;
sampling and testing. A summary of the EMAP is provided in Annex 5.&#13;
3.31  The project would include international and domestic training for PMU-SW and&#13;
PDSTE staff, respectively, for related environmental mitigation techniques. The EPC&#13;
would be contracted by PMU-SW to coordinate the training, conduct baseline surveys of&#13;
environmental conditions, and monitor the implementation of required environmental&#13;
mitigation requirements. The PMU-SW would also contract the relevant PDSTEs for&#13;
their assistance with monitoring. The estimated base cost for monitoring and training is&#13;
US$180,000.&#13;
3.32  During negotiations, agreement was obtained from  the Government that&#13;
establishment of an environmental unit within PMU-SW will be a condition of credit&#13;
effectiveness. During project implementation, PMU-SW will implement environmental&#13;
monitoring and take adequate steps to mitigate any adverse impacts on the basis of the&#13;
EMAP (para. 5.1(d)).&#13;
E.   RESETTLEMEENT&#13;
3.33  Waterway widening, deepening and related disposal of dredge spoil will require the&#13;
acquisition of land and other assets of affected households settled along the canal banks.&#13;
PMU-SW has prepared a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) dated August, 1997, with the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
participation of the PCs of the five affected provinces. The RAP is consistent with World&#13;
Bank Operational Directive 4.30, Involuntary Resettlement, and with Vietnamese law.&#13;
The RAP was approved by the Prime Minister's Decision No. 4162/KTN dated August&#13;
20, 1997, and by the Minister of Transport and Communication's Decision No.&#13;
2141/CGD dated August 28, 1997.&#13;
3.34 The RAP (summarized in Annex 6) identifies a total of about 5,000 project-&#13;
affected families (PAFs), of which only about 1,300 are expected to require resettlement.&#13;
Very few PAFs belong to ethnic minorities.2 PAFs will be compensated for affected land,&#13;
structures, crops and other assets. In most cases available unused government land will be&#13;
utilized for dredged spoil but where acquisition of agricultural land can not be avoided the&#13;
land owners will be compensated in accordance with the policy. An estimated 1,320 ha&#13;
will be required for the deposit of dredged spoil. Severely affected PAFs requiring&#13;
resettlement will be given a choice between land-for-land or cash compensation in addition&#13;
to rehabilitation assistance. If all eligible PAFs choose resettlement, about 13 ha would be&#13;
acquired and improved (including infrastructure services) for resettlement. PAFs will also&#13;
receive training and employment opportunities, building materials, and compensation for&#13;
subsistence and moving expenses. The total resettlement cost (including the cost of land&#13;
acquisition for resettlement and compensation to PAFs) is estimated at US$11.4 million&#13;
excluding contingencies.&#13;
3.35   To minimize the project's resettlement impact, the design parameters of canal&#13;
improvements were revised in heavily populated areas.  These revisions included:&#13;
(a) reducing the design width of waterways; (b) widening on only one side of waterways,&#13;
where possible; (c) constructing a canal at Rach Gia that bypasses the center of the city,&#13;
and (d) terminating waterway improvements before the town of Ca Mau.&#13;
3.36  Four of the five affected provinces have already identified relocation sites for the&#13;
resettlement of PAFs. These sites will be further evaluated for their suitability for&#13;
relocation as well as its acceptability by the PAFs. Re-confirmation of PAFs' preferences,&#13;
and further refinement of data of affected structures set forth in the 1995/96 Detailed&#13;
Measurement Survey (DMS), will be carried out during project implementation. A pilot&#13;
project for training and testing of implementation procedures has already been carried out.&#13;
During negotiations, agreement was obtained from the Government that resettlement will&#13;
be in accordance with the RAP and in a manner satisfactory to IDA, including provision of&#13;
semi-annual resettlement monitoring reports commencing July 31, 1998, and a final&#13;
evaluation on completion of resettlement activities (para. 5.1(e)). As a condition of&#13;
effectiveness, PMU-SW will retain an independent monitoring agency with qualified and&#13;
experienced staff, under terms of reference satisfactory to IDA, to monitor and report on&#13;
resettlement activities (para. 5.2(a)).&#13;
2 Ethnic Khmer, Chinese and Cham are located in Kien Giang and Can Tho provinces. They&#13;
comprise less than 5% of PAFs in each province and are fully integrated, socially and economically, with&#13;
the local Kinh population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
F.    PROJECT IMPLEM:ENTATION&#13;
3.37 Responsibility. MOT will be the executing agency while the PMU-SW will be&#13;
responsible for overall project implementation. MOT will maintain PMU-SW at all times&#13;
during the project implementation period, with an adequate budget and qualified, full-time&#13;
staff (including a project manager) to supervise and coordinate all project activities (para.&#13;
5.1 (f)). These activities will include overseeing contractors, consultants and other&#13;
agencies providing services to the project, and reviewing/managing environmental&#13;
monitoring and resettlement activities in coordination with the provincial PCs.  For&#13;
Component B of the project, PMU-SW will enter into an Implementation Arrangement&#13;
with the Can Tho Port Enterprise for the procurement of works, goods and services&#13;
(condition of effectiveness, see para. 5.2(c)). Commencing October 31, 1998, PMU-SW&#13;
will annually submit to IDA, for its concurrence, proposed training programs for its&#13;
forthcoming fiscal year, and that training will be carried out in accordance with proposed&#13;
training programs satisfactory to IDA (para. 5. 1(g)).&#13;
3.38   Schedule. The project will be implemented over five years on the basis of a&#13;
Project Implementation Plan (PIP) prepared by the GOV.  Annex 7 presents (a) a&#13;
summary Project Implementation Schedule, which provides the baseline against which&#13;
progress have been monitored, and (b) Monitoring Indicators for Project Works. The&#13;
project completion date is expected to be December 31, 2002 and the loan closing date is&#13;
scheduled for June 30, 2003.&#13;
G.    PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.39  All goods, works and consultant services to be financed under the IDA credit will&#13;
be procured by PMU-SW in accordance with World Bank guidelines.3  All works and&#13;
goods procured under International Competitive Bidding (ICB) will use the Bank standard&#13;
bidding documents. Similarly, the Borrower will be required to use the Bank Standard&#13;
Form of Contract for Consultant Services and the Standard Bid Evaluation Form for&#13;
evaluation of bids. Agreement was reached at negotiations that the Borrower's local&#13;
procurement procedures (Decree 43/CP dated July 16, 1996, as amended by Decree&#13;
93/CP dated August 25, 1997, and the Guidelines issued by Circular 02/TTLB dated&#13;
February 25, 1997) will be used for National Competitive Bidding (NCB), with the&#13;
required revisions and clarifications for purposes of consistency with the Bank's&#13;
Guidelines for NCB set forth in a Supplemental Letter to the Development Credit&#13;
Agreement. These arrangements will encourage the participation of eligible qualified local&#13;
contractors (enterprises which are financially and managerially autonomous and have&#13;
capacity to undertake the proposed work). Table 3.2 summarizes the procurement&#13;
arrangements and Annex 8 provides a summary Procurement Plan.&#13;

3.40  Civil Works. IDA will finance the contract packages for civil works for waterway&#13;
improvements (Component A) and Can Tho Port improvement (Component B) as well as&#13;
the Waterway Central Building (Component C) as listed in Annex 8. Civil works&#13;
estimated to cost more than US$2.0 million per contract will be procured under ICB. ICB&#13;
contracts will include dredging works, bridges, and the navigation lock. Bidders for ICB&#13;
contracts will be subject to pre-qualification. Works for the navigation lock, access&#13;
bridges, and demolition of the bridge at Thoi Binh will be grouped into one package&#13;
estimated to cost US$4.70 million. The bridges at Trinh Huu Ngia, Vinh Thuan and Sa&#13;
Dec will be grouped into one package estimated at US$7.90 million. The bids of pre-&#13;
qualified domestic contractors will be evaluated with a 7.5 percent margin of preference.&#13;
Contractors will be permitted to bid for one or more of the packages in order to provide&#13;
attractive bidding opportunities for both international and local contractors.&#13;
3.41  Contracts for civil works estimated to cost individually less than US$2.0 million&#13;
each will be awarded under NCB procedures acceptable to IDA (see para. 3.40; including&#13;
local advertising, public opening, clearly stated evaluation criteria, award to the lowest&#13;
evaluated responsive bidder, and non-exclusion of foreign bidders if interested). Foreign&#13;
and domestic companies will be permitted to bid jointly. Civil works procured under NCB&#13;
are estimated not to exceed an aggregate of US$8.7 million. NCB contracts include&#13;
works and bridges at Cai San, Doan Ket and Kien Luong, Can Tho port works, the&#13;
Waterway Control Center, Ca Mau Landing Stage, slope protection works and market&#13;
relocations. Since resettlement works are small and widely scattered, they would be&#13;
carried out by the provinces under force account. The aggregate amount estimated for&#13;
resettlement site preparation work is US$7.9 million. Similarly, navaids will be assembled&#13;
and installed by VIWA/SD under force account costing US$2.0 million in aggregate.&#13;
These works will be implemented with the prior approval of IDA. Both VIWA/SD and&#13;
provincial units are well organized and have the capacity to execute such works at&#13;
economical prices. However, reasonable unit basis will be established by PMU-SW for&#13;
the purpose of payment duly approved by IDA. The invitation to pre-qualify or bid for&#13;
each contract estimated to cost US$10.0 million equivalent or more shall be advertised.&#13;
There are sufficient numbers of experienced local dredging and construction contractors to&#13;
ensure satisfactory competition under NCB. The proposed procurement plan considers&#13;
the status and capacity of the local construction and dredging industries and offers them&#13;
the opportunity to participate individually or in a consortia with local or foreign&#13;
companies. To this end, special consideration was given to factors such as size of&#13;
individual packages, unit prices (e.g., unit rates for dredging) and market conditions in&#13;
terms of the level of competition, firms' financial health and quality of work completed in&#13;
recent years. The project thus aims to strengthen and help build a reliable and healthy&#13;
local dredging and construction industry.&#13;

3.42 Goods and Equipment. Goods to be procured will include navaids components,&#13;
operations and maintenance equipment, and cargo handling equipment for Can Tho Port.&#13;
Contracts for goods valued at more than US$100,000 will be let under ICB procedures.&#13;
When bids are evaluated, domestic manufacturers will receive a margin of preference of 15&#13;
percent of the CIF bid price of imported goods or the actual customs duties and export&#13;
taxes, whichever is less. International and national shopping will be used for goods valued&#13;
at US$100,000 or less per contract up to an aggregate value of US$400,000 equivalent.&#13;
At least three quotations from qualified bidders from at least two countries would be&#13;
sought in the case of international shopping. National shopping will be in accordance with&#13;
procedures acceptable to IDA. Where feasible, vehicles for PMU-SW and VIWA/SD may&#13;
be procured through the UNDP Inter-Agency Procurement Services Office (UNDP-&#13;
IAPSO).&#13;
3.43  Consultant Services. Consultancies to be procured will include: construction&#13;
supervision services for all civil works; technical assistance, advisory and training services&#13;
for PMU-SW, VIWA/SD and Can Tho Port Enterprise; design, procurement and&#13;
inspection services for vessel and equipment procurement; and environmental monitoring.&#13;
Construction services under Component C (para. 3.21-22), other than environmental and&#13;
resettlement monitoring services procured under the Quality-Based Selection (QBS), will&#13;
be provided by qualified firms selected on the basis of Quality- and Cost-Based Selection&#13;
(QCBS). The salient features of QCBS include: (a) mandatory advertising for contracts&#13;
over US$200,000 in the national newspaper and in Development Business (IJNDB);&#13;
(b) no mandatory associations between foreign and local consultants; and (c) restricted use&#13;
of sole-sourcing. The construction supervision consultants will be responsible for local&#13;
operating expenses related to the project (including supervision, vehicles for local&#13;
transport, office supplies and travel expenses) estimated at US$0.8 million.&#13;
3.44 Tender Documentation. The Bank's standard bidding documents will be used&#13;
for all goods and works procured under ICB and for consultant services. The standard&#13;
NCB bidding documents the Government is preparing will be used for all goods and&#13;
works procured in this manner.&#13;
3.45  Prior review thresholds and reporting requirements. Prior review by IDA of&#13;
draft tender documents, bid evaluation reports and recommendations for award of&#13;
contracts will be carried out for: (a) works estimated to cost the equivalent of&#13;
US$200,000 or more; and (b) goods estimated to cost over US$100,000. This will cover&#13;
more than 80 percent of procurement for civil works and goods. For consultant services,&#13;
the prior review threshold (for review of the terms-of-reference, cost estimate, selection&#13;
criteria, consultant shortlists, requests for proposals and final contracts) are:&#13;
(a) US$100,000 or more, but less than the equivalent of US$200,000 for each contract;&#13;
and (b) each contract with consulting firms equivalent to US$200,000 or more and each&#13;
contract for employment of an individual consultant which costs the equivalent of&#13;
US$50,000 or more. Selective post-review of contract awards or purchases where costs&#13;
are below the thresholds listed above will be carried out by the Resident Mission in Hanoi.&#13;

H.   DISBURSEMENT&#13;
3.47 The credit will be disbursed against eligible expenditures within the categories&#13;
summarized in Table 3.3. It is expected to be fully disbursed by June 30, 2003.&#13;
3.48 The estimated disbursement schedule (Annex 9) is based on the detailed PIP. As&#13;
there is no IDA/Bank disbursement profile available for inland waterway improvements or&#13;
other transport projects in Vietnam, the profile reflects IDA/Bank experience with&#13;
disbursement in other World Bank transport projects in the East Asia and Pacific Region&#13;
and the limited experience under the on-going first Highway Rehabilitation Project.&#13;
3.49  Disbursements would be made against statements of expenditure (SOE) prepared&#13;
by PMU-SW for all expenditures for (a) goods under contracts costing less than&#13;
US$100,000; (b) works under contracts costing less than US$200,000; (c) training under&#13;
contracts costing less than US$25,000; (d) services by consulting firms under contracts&#13;
costing less than US$100,000; and (e) services by individual consultants under contracts&#13;
costing less than US$50,000. Documents supporting the SOEs will be retained by PMU-&#13;
SW and made available for IDA review during supervision missions. Full documentation&#13;
will be required for all eligible expenditures.&#13;
3.50  To facilitate withdrawal of funds, a special account will be established in a bank&#13;
acceptable to IDA, and on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. The account will be&#13;
established in US currency with an authorized allocation of US$2.5 million initially limited&#13;
to US$1.0 million until the aggregate amount of withdrawals plus outstanding special&#13;
commitments amount to  SDR  4.0 million equivalent.   Based on  satisfactory&#13;
documentation, it will be replenished monthly or when drawn down by 30 percent of the&#13;
initial deposit, whichever comes first. The minimum application size for payments directly&#13;
from the credit account or for issuance of special commnitments will be US$400,000.&#13;
.    AcCOUNTS AND AUDITING&#13;
3.51  During negotiations, agreement was obtained from  the Government that:&#13;
(a) PMU-SW will maintain separate project accounts; (b) the special account and project&#13;
account, including documentation for SOEs, will be audited annually by independent&#13;
external auditors acceptable to IDA and the Government, with the audit including a&#13;
separate opinion on the SOEs used as a basis for disbursements; and (c) the detailed audit&#13;
reports will be submitted to IDA within six months of the end of each of the&#13;
Government's fiscal years (para. 5. 1(i)).&#13;
J.    PROJECT SUPERVISION, REPORTING AND MONITORING&#13;
3.52  During implementation, the project will be supervised by Bank staff in the field and&#13;
at headquarters according to the Project Supervision Plan presented in Annex 8. Annual&#13;
implementation reviews with the Government will be carried out each November to assess&#13;
project progress (including project works, resettlement activities, and environmental&#13;
impact mitigation) and the Government's expenditure plan for the inland waterways&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
system, with particular attention to funding for maintenance. A mid-term review (mid-&#13;
2000) will be undertaken jointly with other donors to assess:  (a) overall progress,&#13;
including the experience with resettlement and environmental monitoring; (b) the sector&#13;
expenditures and fiscal reforms; (c) results of the on-going studies including the Bassac&#13;
River study; and (d) the Government's overall plans and programs for the sector.&#13;
3.53  During negotiations, an understanding was reached that the Government will hold&#13;
a project launch workshop soon after the credit is declared effective, and agreement was&#13;
reached that the Government will hold annual implementation reviews (by September 30&#13;
of each year commencing in 1999) and a mid-term review (by September 30, 2000) (para.&#13;
5.1(j)). The project launch workshop will be held in HCMC. All implementing agencies&#13;
will be involved and representatives of project beneficiaries will be invited to attend. IDA&#13;
will be represented by an appropriate team of specialists. Supervision efforts will require&#13;
about 69 staff-weeks over the life of the project, of which about 11 will be at headquarters&#13;
and 58 staff-weeks in the field, as described in the Project Supervision Plan.&#13;
3.54  Supervision efforts will require expertise in civil (port and waterway) engineering,&#13;
procurement, financial analysis, specific areas of inland waterway management and in&#13;
environmental and resettlement issues.&#13;
3.55  Agreement was also obtained during negotiations that PMU-SW will prepare and&#13;
furnish IDA with consolidated quarterly reports on the project's physical and financial&#13;
progress, including procurement information, in a format acceptable to IDA (para. 5.1(k)).&#13;
The reports will be submitted no later than the 30th day of the month following the&#13;
respective quarterly period, beginning July 31, 1998.&#13;

4. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
A.   EcONOMIc ANALYSIS&#13;
Introduction&#13;
4.1   The project will significantly impact the economies of the Mekong Delta&#13;
provinces. Reduction of waterway bottlenecks, improved large vessel capacity and&#13;
around-the-clock navigability will stimulate development, particularly for the rural&#13;
population, which is heavily dependent on waterways. The main quantifiable benefits of&#13;
the proposed investments are: (a) savings in cargo transport and handling costs;&#13;
(b) increases in productivity by enabling use of larger barges and night navigation; and&#13;
(c) avoidance of costly and environmentally undesirable traffic diversion from inland&#13;
waterways to roads. Benefits that have not been quantified include: improved traffic&#13;
safety; benefits to passengers; reduction in flooding due to embankment improvement and&#13;
the creation of bunds (dikes); and land reclamation through the deposit of dredge spoil in&#13;
low-lying areas.&#13;
Waterway Improvements Component&#13;
4.2   This component aims to reduce transport costs in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta&#13;
and to avoid freight traffic diversion to more costly and environmentally undesirable road&#13;
transport. Using regional freight traffic projections for the years 2000, 2015 and 2020&#13;
under "low" and "base" economic scenarios, 15 project alternatives were considered.&#13;
Seven of these were evaluated in detail and their estimated economic costs and benefits&#13;
compared to a "without project" scenario.  These alternatives are summarized in&#13;
Annex 11. The preferred alternative generated the highest economic net present value and&#13;
caused the least disruption to the environment in terms of resettlement and interference&#13;
with other water control and aquaculture projects. In addition, the selected alternative&#13;
supported the GOV's regional development strategy for the Delta which envisages Can&#13;
Tho as the geographic center connected by main commercial waterways to areas of high&#13;
economic potential.&#13;
4.3   The traffic forecasts were prepared taking into account socio-economic factors&#13;
such as population growth rate, overall economic indices (e.g., regional GDP) and product&#13;
studies related to the major comnmodities produced and consumed in the Mekong Delta.&#13;
Based on these studies, origin and destination matrices (including modal split) were&#13;
developed for base-case and low-case traffic scenarios, projected to the anchor years&#13;
2000, 2015 and 2020, and interpolated for the other years.  Under the project,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-34 -&#13;
inland waterways are expected to retain more than half of the region's traffic well into the&#13;
next century. Table 4.1 presents the traffic forecast for the selected project alternatives,&#13;
under both the base-case and low-case traffic forecasts.&#13;

4.4    Three categories of economic cost were considered: capital costs (including&#13;
resettlement); operating and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs; and fleet operating costs based on&#13;
projected fleet composition.  Capital costs were approximated by multiplying the&#13;
estimated quantities of physical works (e.g., capital dredging, widening, resettlement,&#13;
navaids) by the unit economic costs of these works in international markets. O&amp;M costs&#13;
were estimated by assessing the cost of keeping the project waterways in optimal working&#13;
condition. Vessel operating costs were estimated by using an inland waterway transport&#13;
cost (IWTC) model developed by consultants for the Mekong Delta Master Plan Study.&#13;
4.5    Three types of economic benefits were quantified: reductions in vessel operating&#13;
costs; avoided costs of diverting traffic from the inland waterways to roads; and gains in&#13;
fleet productivity resulting from night navigation. Vessel operating cost reductions were&#13;
calculated using the IWTC model. The avoided cost of traffic diversion to roads was&#13;
measured as the difference between vehicle operating cost on roads (assuming typical&#13;
roads for the Mekong Delta, adjusted for improvements, where appropriate) and vessel&#13;
operating costs on the improved waterways. Vehicle operating cost estimates were&#13;
adopted from the recently completed Bank project studies in the Mekong Delta and two&#13;
highway studies.' Fleet productivity improvements were estimated using the IWTC model&#13;
and assuming that about 50 percent of the barge fleet (23.5 percent of total fleet capacity)&#13;
will use night navigation. The analysis indicates that introducing night navigation would&#13;
reduce transport costs from about US$4.8 per ton to US$3.9 per ton. It would also&#13;
reduce additional fleet capacity requirements by 10-15 percent (equivalent to 8,000 to&#13;
12,000 dwt).&#13;

4.7   Sensitivity Analysis. A sensitivity analysis evaluated the impact of variations in&#13;
five key parameters by constructing six scenarios: (a) an increase in capital costs by 20&#13;
percent; (b) project delay by one year; (c) a 10 percent increase in the estimated vessel&#13;
operating costs; (d) low traffic; (e) under the without project case, assuming 10 percent&#13;
traffic diversion to road instead of 20 percent by 2010; and (f) a combination of scenarios&#13;
(a) through (d). The results, summarized in Table 4.3, indicate that even under scenario&#13;
(f), which is very conservative, the project yields satisfactory economic returns (NPV&#13;
US$33.0 million and ERR 15 percent). The switching value for the most conservative&#13;
parameter, vessel operating costs, was estimated to occur when it increased by 24 percent&#13;
(for details see Annex 11).&#13;

Can Tho Port Improvement Component&#13;
4.8   The flow of gocds through Can Tho Port has fluctuated between 54,000 tons&#13;
(1993) and about 183,000 tons (1996) due to variations in demand for two major&#13;
commodities, rice and cement.&#13;
4.9   The Can Tho hinterland has substantial potential to attract and generate additional&#13;
traffic. The southern delta exports surplus paddy to other areas of the country and&#13;
international markets (about 43 percent of total yield or 6 million tons in 1994). In&#13;
addition, the region imports from other regions and abroad about 3.1 million tons (1993)&#13;
of other goods it consumes, such as fertilizer, cement, steel and construction materials.&#13;
4.10  As noted in Chapter 2, the commercial potential of Can Tho Port depends on&#13;
several exogenous factors, including shippers' preference for the ports in HCMC. With&#13;
this in mind, three traffic scenarios were examined, reflecting low, base and high growth&#13;
assumptions (Annex 1 1). The base case is assumed to be the most likely scenario.&#13;
4.11  Without a minimum investment port is unlikely to reach its traffic potential. The&#13;
existing shore-based cranes are old and likely to become unreliable within two years.&#13;
With the result ships have to use their own gear to load and unload cargo. Using a berth&#13;
occupancy model, it was estimated that without the proposed investments (including&#13;
improvements to fendering), queuing times will increase by almost 50 percent, from 460&#13;
days to 670 days.2  In other words, Can Tho Port would handle only about 393,000 tons&#13;
of cargo instead of 572,000 tons in the year 2000. The remaining 179,000 tons would be&#13;
diverted to HCMC ports.3&#13;
4.12  The economic cost of diverting cargo to HCMC is calculated at US$4.36 per ton&#13;
(excluding extra handling), which is the cost of shipping rice to HCMC by inland&#13;
waterway. The cost of cargo shipped by road would be even higher, about US$8.65 per&#13;
ton.&#13;
4.13   The economic benefits of proposed improvements reflect the avoided cost of&#13;
waterway transport from Can Tho to HCMC. Benefits associated with the improvement&#13;
in safety and environmental management at the port were not quantified. Moreover, the&#13;
proposed improvements are expected to attract complementary private-sector investments&#13;
in port superstructures and facilities. Benefits were held constant at year 2000 levels, as&#13;
the port would attain its full capacity with its present layout and the proposed investments.&#13;
Based on these assumptions, the proposed improvements would yield an NPV of US$2.2&#13;
million and an ERR of 43 percent.&#13;
2 NEDECO, Inland Waterways and Port Modernization Project, Rehabilitation and Modernization&#13;
of the Port of Can Tho, Final Report, July 1996.&#13;
3i.e. 572,000 tons (=cargo throughput forecast for 2000) x (670-460)/670 = 179,000 tons.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
4.14  Sensitivity Analysis. The base scenario assumes that the proposed investments&#13;
and pro-active port management will make the port an attractive alternative to HCMC&#13;
ports. Despite low likelihood, it is possible that shippers and ship owners will continue&#13;
using HCMC ports and incur higher transport costs. The low traffic scenario reflects this&#13;
case and assumes no future traffic increase from the 1995 level. Under this scenario and in&#13;
the case when a new port is built in the vicinity of Can Tho Port (by the city or within an&#13;
export processing zone (EPZ)), the proposed investment in Can Tho port would become&#13;
uneconomical. All cargo could be handled by ship's gear without any increase in waiting&#13;
times.&#13;
4.15  Under the high traffic scenario, the port's capacity would be inadequate, even with&#13;
the proposed investments. In the event projected traffic is 510,000 tons/year (between the&#13;
low and base scenarios), the ERR on the investment would be 11 percent and the NPV&#13;
US$51,000 (see Annex 11).&#13;
B.    FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF CAN THO PORT&#13;
IMPROVEMENT COMPONENT&#13;
4.16  Can Tho Port's historical performance shows volatile sales and profitability. The&#13;
port posted losses in 1993 and 1994; however, it turned a small profit in 1995. Historical&#13;
and pro forma financial statements for Can Tho Port are presented in Annex 12, Table&#13;
A12.3.&#13;
4.17  Cash flow analyses were performed for the proposed investment in Can Tho Port&#13;
on a standalone basis, and for the enterprise as a whole, under base-case, high-case and&#13;
low-case throughput scenarios. The key assumptions of the base case are: (a) with the&#13;
project, port capacity increases from the current estimated level of 378,000 per annum to&#13;
572,000 the year after investment; (b) cargo demand increases by 32.9 percent per annum&#13;
in 1996-2000 and 3.4 percent per annum in 2000-2015 (as in economic analysis); (c) port&#13;
fees remain at 1995 levels in real terms (i.e., they increase in line with inflation), (d) unit&#13;
variable operating costs remain at 1995 levels in real terms, and (e) the useful life of the&#13;
investment is conservatively estimated at 20 years (the port's existing cranes and&#13;
infrastructure are over 30 years old). Detailed assumptions for the financial projections&#13;
are presented in Annex 12, Table A12. 1, and in the Project Files.&#13;
4.18  Based on the base-case assumptions, the discounted cash flow analysis of the&#13;
investment indicates that the Can Tho Port component would generate a positive cash&#13;
flow beginning in 2001, the first full year of operation, resulting in an acceptable financial&#13;
internal rate of return (IRR) and NPV at a (nominal) discount rate of 12.5 percent. The&#13;
financial analysis of the project is presented in Annex Table A12.2 and the results are&#13;
summarized in Table 4.4.&#13;

4.19  Financial analysis of the enterprise as a whole shows that it would generate&#13;
adequate profits and debt-service coverage under the base case scenario, which assumes&#13;
commercial on-lending terms (VND lent at 15 percent per annum for a term of 20 years).&#13;
By 2003, the port would generate a 3.4 percent return on net fixed assets, a debt service&#13;
coverage ratio of 3.7 times, and sufficient cash to fiund an additional US$2.0 million of&#13;
investment. Projected financial statements for Can Tho Port are presented in Annex 12,&#13;
Table A12.3.&#13;
4.20  Sensitivity Analysis. The key financial risks for this component include the&#13;
possibilities that: (a) the expected increase in throughput do not materialize; (b) port fees&#13;
do not keep pace with inflation; and (c) management fails to control operating costs.&#13;
Sensitivity analysis shows that the financial returns are sensitive to deviations in these&#13;
parameters. The component's financial NPV and IRR would fall below acceptable levels&#13;
(US$0 and 12.5 percent, respectively) under any of the following assumptions (relative to&#13;
the base case): (a) port throughput increases by less than 28.8 percent per annum in 1996-&#13;
2000; (b) tariffs decline by more than 0.6 percent in real terms; or (c) unit variable&#13;
operating costs increase by more than 10.6 percent in real terms. Table 4.5 presents the&#13;
switching values for the financial sensitivity analysis.&#13;

4.21  To ensure adequate throughput growth, Can Tho port managers need to market&#13;
their services, repair existing structures and ensure reliable port operations. These actions&#13;
are critical to changing the perception of shippers and local businesses about port services.&#13;
To mitigate the risk that the projected growth in traffic does not materialize, the proposed&#13;
investment has been kept to a minimum and has been planned in two phases (see para.&#13;
4.24). To contain unit operating costs, management needs to improve financial controls.&#13;
To address these issues, technical assistance will be provided to assist the management in:&#13;
(a) concluding long-term contracts between the port and its main clients, (b) improving the&#13;
port's financial management, (c) identifying opportunities for private participation, and&#13;
(d) promoting skill development through training or twinning arrangements with another&#13;
regional port in Asia (see Annex 3B).&#13;
C.   PROJECT RISKS AND MITIGATION MEASURES&#13;
4.22  Potential risks can be classified into two groups: those related to project&#13;
implementation and those related to the economic and business environment. Project&#13;
implementation risks include environmental and resettlement risks and the implementing&#13;
capacity of the PMU-SW. The disposal of the estimated 10 million cu. meters of dredge&#13;
spoil poses both environmental and resettlement-related risks. Appropriate disposal sites&#13;
need to be identified and prepared. Similarly, ASS spoils will require adequate treatment&#13;
to minimize exposure to water and/or air. Resettlement in accordance with IDA's&#13;
guidelines has proved difficult in Vietnam and could be a source of delays in project&#13;
implementation. In addition, the implementing agency, the newly established PMU-SW,&#13;
lacks experience in managing such a large-scale project.&#13;
4.23  A number of steps has already been taken to address these risks. The draft EMAP&#13;
and RAP prepared for the project have identified appropriate mitigation and monitoring&#13;
measures (Annexes 5 and 6). In addition, a pilot resettlement project has been examined&#13;
in the project area to familiarize local authorities, project affected people and PMU-SW&#13;
with the procedures agreed in the RAP. PMU-SW has also established close links with&#13;
the Bank's HRP project staff who are undertaking major resettlement activities. During&#13;
the project preparation phase, PMU-SW staff received training in the Bank's procurement&#13;
procedures and resettlement activity planning. The risks associated with the relative&#13;
inexperience of the project executing agency will be further mitigated through the&#13;
provision of consulting services, technical assistance and training to PMU-SW, the Port of&#13;
Can Tho and VIWA/SD in the areas of tendering procedures, construction supervision,&#13;
and operational maintenance and management of the inland waterway system and the Port.&#13;
4.24  Recent economic growth in the region has exceeded expectations. However,&#13;
potential risks related to the economic and business environment cannot be ruled out.&#13;
Traffic on the waterways has been relatively immune to lower economic growth. By&#13;
contrast, the Port of Can Tho displayed high sensitivity to cargo traffic but the main&#13;
factors affecting the port traffic would be the attractiveness of Can Tho in intercepting the&#13;
traffic bound for HCMC ports and the Government specified rice quota for exporters in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
the delta. Several precautions have been taken to reduce this risk. First, the proposed&#13;
investment in Can Tho Port has been limited to the minimum level deemed necessary to&#13;
preserve the current capacity and assets while increasing the commercial attractiveness of&#13;
the port for customers, and paving the way for privatization during the implementation&#13;
phase. Second, a large share of the proposed investments, particularly in equipment&#13;
(crane, tractors and trailers), is movable. If the worst case scenarios were to materialize,&#13;
the equipment could be transferred or sold to more productive locations.&#13;
4.25 Past experience suggests that an economic downturn could also affect funding for&#13;
O&amp;M of waterways. Although existing user charges paid by operators cover O&amp;M&#13;
requirements, the O&amp;M budget for inland waterways is currently under-funded. However,&#13;
since GOV has steadily increased the O&amp;M budget in recent years, this risk poses less of a&#13;
concern. Similarly, any uncertainty about future availability of counterpart funds has been&#13;
reduced somewhat by focusing on the highest priority transport investment program.&#13;
Nonetheless, assurance was obtained at negotiations that by August 31 of each year,&#13;
beginning in 1998, the Government will review and agree jointly with IDA on its annual&#13;
expenditure program for the inland waterways sector for the following year (para. 5. 1(k)).&#13;
An understanding was reached at negotiations that GOV will take all actions necessary to&#13;
ensure that the annual budget of VIWA/SD is increased in real terms and provided in a&#13;
timely manner, starting with FY97, and attains the equivalent of about US$2,000 per&#13;
kilometer of national inland waterways under the administration of VIWA/SD by the year&#13;
2000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND&#13;
RECOMMENDATION&#13;
5.1   During negotiations, agreement was obtained from the Borrower on the following:&#13;
(a)  a set of quantifiable performance indicators and targets related to project&#13;
performance (para. 3.2 and Annex 2);&#13;
(b)  the Government will take all actions necessary to ensure that PMU-SW and&#13;
VIWA-VN receive the counterpart funds necessary for project&#13;
implementation in a timely manner (para. 3.24);&#13;
(c) The Government shall relend part of the proceeds of the Credit for&#13;
equipment (US$1.1 million) to Can Tho Port Enterprise at a rate of thirteen&#13;
and two-tenths (13.2) percent per annum with repayment over a period of&#13;
twenty years, including a grace period of five years (para. 3 25);&#13;
(d) PMU-SW  will establish an environmental unit, implement environmental&#13;

standard bidding documents for works and goods procured under ICB and&#13;
for all consultant services (para. 3.39);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-42 -&#13;
(i)  PMU-SW  will maintain a separate project account; the project account,&#13;
Special Account and SOEs will be audited annually by independent external&#13;
auditors acceptable to IDA; submission of detailed audit reports to IDA&#13;
within six months after the end of each Government fiscal year (para. 3.51);&#13;
(j)  MOT will hold annual implementation reviews (by September 30 of each&#13;
year commencing in 1999) and a mid-term review (by September 30, 2000)&#13;
(para. 3.53);&#13;
(k)  commencing July 31, 1998, PMU-SW  will prepare and furnish to IDA&#13;
consolidated quarterly reports on the physical and financial progress of the&#13;
project, including procurement information, in a format acceptable to IDA.&#13;
The reports will be submitted no later than the 30th day of the month&#13;
following the respective quarterly period, beginning July 31, 1998. (para.&#13;
3.55).&#13;
(1)  by August 31 of each year, beginning in 1998, the Government will review&#13;
and agree jointly with IDA on its annual expenditure program for the inland&#13;
waterways sector for the forthcoming year (para. 4.25).&#13;
5.2   The conditions of effectiveness are:&#13;

independent monitoring agency pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 5 of&#13;
Schedule 4 to the negotiated DCA; and (ii) establish the PMU-SW/&#13;
Environmental Unit pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 2(c) of Schedule&#13;
4 to the negotiated DCA;&#13;
(b) that each of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement and the Financing Agreement&#13;
has been executed on behalf of the Borrower and Can Tho Port Enterprise;&#13;
and&#13;
(c)  that the Implementation Arrangement has been executed by Can Tho Port&#13;
Enterprise and PMU-SW.&#13;
5.3   Subject to the above, the project provides a suitable basis for an IDA credit of&#13;
SDR 53.7 million (US$73.0 million equivalent) to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The&#13;
credit would be for a term of 40 years including a grace period of 10 years.&#13;

INLAND WATERWAYS AND PORT REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Technical Assistance in Port Operations, Marketine and Business Development for&#13;
the Can Tho Port&#13;
Outline Terms of Reference&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    At present, the Port of Can Tho, situated about 75 km upstream from the mouth of&#13;
the Bassac, is a small river port with a throughput that has fluctuated in the past between&#13;
54,000 tons (1993) and about 200,000 tons (1996). With some improvements in&#13;
infrastructure, and cargo handling equipment under the proposed IDA project during&#13;
1999-2000, the port's capacity is expected to increase to about 600,000 tons per year.&#13;
2.    The port is very dependent on two commodities, rice (80 percent of 1995&#13;
throughput) and cement (12 percent of 1995 throughput), and is therefore subject to&#13;
variations in their market conditions. Until 1994, the port also handled a small number of&#13;
containers, but this trade has dried up due to insufficient volume. Vinafood, a major&#13;
customer located in the vicinity, uses the port as its main outlet for the export of rice.&#13;
3.    Although the Port of Can Tho is located in the center of the Mekong Delta, its&#13;
development has been hampered by silting at the mouth of the Bassac (Dinh Anh) River.&#13;
Only small ships with drafts of about 3 m or about 7,000 dwt can access the port on a&#13;
regular basis. Thus the long-term future of the port as a viable year-round alternative to&#13;
the Port of Saigon depends on the management of the silting problem. There is an on-&#13;
going study aimed at determining a sustainable and economic solution to the problem if&#13;
feasible.&#13;
4.    The major competitor of the Port of Can Tho is the Port of Saigon in HCMC,&#13;
which can handle ships of up to 18,000 dwt. Moreover, HCMC has the added advantage&#13;
of a developed transport, communication, business and administrative infrastructure which&#13;
facilitates trade and influences port choices. Furthermore, the majority of grain merchants&#13;
and other traders have their offices and warehouses in HCMC where they can store, grade&#13;
and further process their merchandise. Thus, the historic trade pattern for commodities&#13;
leaving or entering the Mekong Delta has been via HCMC and the inland waterways&#13;
connecting the Delta with HCMC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5  -                          Annex 3A&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
5.    The hinterland of the Port of Can Tho - the southern Mekong Delta - generates&#13;
substantial traffic. In terms of agricultural production, the southern Delta area produces&#13;
about 6 million tons of paddy (1994), of which almost 57% is consumed by the regional&#13;
population. The remainder is shipped elsewhere in Vietnam or exported. In addition, the&#13;
region consumes about 3.1 million tons of other goods such as fertilizer, cement, steel and&#13;
construction materials (1993), most of which need to be transported from other areas of&#13;
the country or imported from abroad.&#13;
6.    About 85-90% of the total Mekong Delta export and import traffic has historically&#13;
been handled by tICMC, mostly through the Port of Saigon. Rice and paddy produced in&#13;
the Delta is transported to HCMC for further handling, local sale or export; and such&#13;
commodities as fertilizer, steel and machinery are imported via HCMC.&#13;
7.    Can Tho Port has not exploited the transport potential of its hinterland, partly on&#13;
account of the draft limitations at the mouth of the Bassac, but also because of the weak&#13;
physical and service infrastructure of Can Tho City and inadequate marketing of the&#13;
existing port services. As the Port of Can Tho is not expected to change the historic trade&#13;
patterns between the Delta and HCMC in the near term, the focus of the port management&#13;
should be on diversifying its customer base, capturing a share of the expected regional&#13;
raffic growth, and improving its cost managemen.&#13;
OBJECTIVES&#13;
8.    The overall objective of the technical assistance is to assist the development of Can&#13;
Tho Port into a commercial seaport of the Mekong Delta, through: (a) strengthening the&#13;
financial management of the port; (b) increasing its market share by improving port&#13;
operations and its customer base and loyalty; (c) introducing commercial practices in port&#13;
management such as joint ventures, leasing/renting of real estate/facilities, incorporating&#13;
customer needs in port operations and services, etc.; and (d) improving marketing and&#13;
customer relations (shippers and ship owners). The immediate objective is to take actions&#13;
to ensure an increase in the port's throughput to its capacity of 600,000 tons by the turn&#13;
of the century.&#13;
SCOPE OF WORK&#13;
9.    The technical assistance will be provided by port specialists who will work with the&#13;
port staff in undertaking the following:&#13;
A. Financial Management&#13;
(i)  review the port's historical financial performance, including labor costs and&#13;
O&amp;M, and make recommendations on improving its cost control and other&#13;
aspects of financial management.&#13;
&#13;

(ii) develop alternative strategies for expanding customer base in consultation&#13;
with major customers and finally, recommend a marketing action plan and&#13;
accompanying implementation schedule and strategies for staff development&#13;
in consultation with the port's managers.&#13;
C.  Business Plan&#13;
(i)  review the port's operational and financial management practices including&#13;
the current accounting system, data recording and reporting system and&#13;
supporting staff skills;&#13;
(ii)  based on the available port statistics identify and develop a set of&#13;
performance monitoring measures for various port functions, financial&#13;
reporting requirements and other inputs for developing the port's business&#13;
plan; and&#13;
(iii) develop an annual Business Plan, including the organization structure&#13;
opportunities for attracting private investors or operators, key performance&#13;
measures, business forecasts, planned investments and expenditures,&#13;
marketing plan (output from A), and cost control strategies.&#13;
D.  Port Operations and Maintenance&#13;
(i)  establish guidelines for the initial operations of a vessel traffic and cargo&#13;

enterprises (port operators, cargo handling companies, and/or shipping lines);&#13;
formal training in Vietnam or foreign countries and study tours.&#13;
REPORTS AND SCHEDULE&#13;
10.   At the conclusion of a three-month exercise a report covering each of the above&#13;
topics will be prepared by the visiting experts and the Can Tho port staff. The report will&#13;
form the basis for implementing a two-year program of skill development and introduction&#13;
of marketing and business planning practices.&#13;

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    The Mekong Delta covers an area of about 39,000 square km in Vietnam. Most of its&#13;
population of 16 million people is engaged in agricultural activities. They generate over 30%&#13;
of the country's agricultural output. The Government of Vietnam has formulated its regional&#13;
development strategy in the Mekong Delta Master Plan (MDMP). It envisages the fuirther&#13;
development of the primary sectors - agriculture, forestry and fisheries - to be complemented&#13;
by industries in the secondary and tertiary sectors such as light industries and services. These&#13;
will be located primarily in urban areas in the delta and they will provide alternative&#13;
employment opportunities for the rural population. In this context the city of Can Tho is to be&#13;
developed into the delta's most important growth center.&#13;
2.    Among other things, the successful implementation of the MDMP and the&#13;
transformation of Can Tho into the delta's central urban area will require the provision of an&#13;
adequate transport infrastructure, primarily inland waterways, port facilities and roads. Inland&#13;
waterways are the delta's most important transport mode: about 4,800 km of waterways are&#13;
navigable, of which about 1,600 km form the main waterways. There are almost three times as&#13;
many waterways as there are roads. Freight transport by waterways accounts for about 65%&#13;
(or 7 million tons) of all cargo transported. Present and future cargo transported in the Delta&#13;
comprises mainly rice, fertilizer and construction materials. Because of their comparative&#13;
advantage for this type of transport, inland waterways are expected to continue carrying the&#13;
major part of freight in the delta. Passenger transport by inland waterway is mainly over short&#13;
distances while roads are the most important mode for long distance passenger transport.&#13;
3.    Inland waterways, ports, roads and related transport infrastructure in the Mekong&#13;
Delta is in a state of disrepair and requires rehabilitation and improvement in order to provide&#13;
efficient transport and to support the anticipated development of the Delta. The Government&#13;
has therefore established a priority program to rehabilitate and modernize the most important&#13;
sections of the Delta's inland waterway system, including the Port of Can Tho. The program&#13;
will also include the improvement of waterway and port maintenance, control of pollution and&#13;
vessel waste disposal in the Delta's inland waterways and rivers, navigation aids, maritime&#13;
safety and environmental protection.&#13;
&#13;

4.    The MDMP included a Feasibility Study examining and analyzing the inland waterway&#13;
rehabilitation and improvement program which concluded, among other things, that a priority&#13;
program should be established to rehabilitate and improve the two main inland waterway&#13;
routes carrying most of present-day trafflic. The Project includes, among other components,&#13;
provision for the rehabilitation and improvement of these two major inland waterway routes, as&#13;
described below.&#13;
5.    The two pfimary domestic inland waterway routes, expected to carry about 60% of the&#13;
waterborne cargo trafflic in the Mekong Delta, are (a) Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) via Cho Gao&#13;
and Sa Dec to Lap Vo and then via Rach Gia to Kien Luong (about 330 Iam); and (b) HCMC&#13;
via Cho Gao, Cho Lach and Mang Thit to Can Tho and then Can Tho via Xa No and Thoi&#13;
Binh to Ca Mau (about 350 kmn). The Project will include rehabilitation and improvement of&#13;
the inland waterways comprising these main routes to provide waterways allowing day and&#13;
night two-way navigation all year round with draft and air clearance permitting efficient&#13;
operations. The actual length of canal to be rehabilitated and/or improved will be about 562&#13;
km due to the fact that part of these two waterway routes use the same canal reach (HCMC to&#13;
Cho Gao).&#13;
6.    Least available depth (LAD) would be approximately 3.0 meters (at low water) and air&#13;
draft 7.0 meters (at high tide level), allowing safe passage of most vessels under normal&#13;
conditions, and, in terms of needed depth, of all inland waterway vessels now in use at higher&#13;
tidal levels. To provide the needed air draft, it will be necessary to modify, improve or replace&#13;
about five bridges. It will also be necessary to construct a navigation lock at one location, in&#13;
order to bypass obstructions due to a salinity control installation which would prevent vessel&#13;
passage. Other works, to prevent erosion, stabilize slopes, and provide safer navigation will&#13;
also be included in the Project as will an improved minor port landing area for more efficient&#13;
cargo handling and new canal sections needed to bypass congested or densely settled areas.&#13;
7.    In order to provide safe and efficient passage of vessels on the inland waterway system,&#13;
the presently inadequate and unsatisfactory system of navigational aids (navaids) needs to be&#13;
improved, extended and upgraded. The Project will therefore also include provision of navaids&#13;
(both floating and on-shore where appropriate) for the routes being improved so that both day&#13;
and night navigation is possible throughout the year.&#13;
8.    The Project also includes the rehabilitation and improvement of the Port of Can Tho&#13;
(recently designated an international port facility), including infrastructure improvements,&#13;
provision of equipment and technical assistance for improved port operations in order to&#13;
provide more efficient cargo handling.&#13;
9.    The Government of Vietnam has received financial assistance from the International&#13;
Development Association (IDA), an arm of the World Bank Group, in the form of a Credit&#13;
(Credit No.    ) to finance part of the costs of the rehabilitation and improvement work to&#13;
be carried out on the main inland waterway routes under the Inland Waterways and Port&#13;
Rehabilitation Project (the Project). Based on the results and recommendations of the MDMP,&#13;
a feasibility study and preliminary design for the necessary works on the two main canal routes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -                           Annex 3B&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
was carried out. After review and approval of the results of this study by the Government, and&#13;
based on its recommendations, detailed engineering and preparation of tender documents for&#13;
the required works were undertaken. Now that these preparatory activities have been&#13;
completed, the Government and IDA have agreed to engage the services of an appropriately&#13;
qualified consulting engineering organization to assist the Government to conduct proper pre-&#13;
qualification, issue tenders, award construction contracts and supervise construction and other&#13;
related project activities.&#13;
10.   The Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOT) is responsible for all major&#13;
transport modes in Vietnam, including investment and management of all inland waterways,&#13;
ports and associated facilities. MOT has established a Project Management Unit-Southern&#13;
Waterways (PMU-SW) operating under its Inland Waterways Administration (Vietnam) which&#13;
has responsibility for all inland waterways, river ports and shipping throughout Vietnam.&#13;
PMU-SW is responsible for the management and implementation of all inland waterway (and&#13;
associated port) projects undertaken with financing from multi-lateral and bi-lateral sources.&#13;
As such, it is the Implementing Agency for this Project. The Vietnam Inland Waterways&#13;
Administration (VIWA) has also set up a department - the Vietnam Inland Waterways&#13;
Administration/Southern Department (VIWA/SD), located in HCMC, which has responsibility&#13;
for the operation and maintenance of all waterways in the south of Vietnam, including the&#13;
project waterways.&#13;
11.   With PMU-SW acting as implementing agency, the Government will carry out bidding&#13;
processes for all the works, goods, equipment and services to be procured under this Project, in&#13;
accordance with World Bank guidelines (revised for National Competitive Bidding as agreed&#13;
with the Bank). Subsequently, supervision of construction will be caried out as described in&#13;
these Terms of Reference (TOR). It is therefore intended to engage the services of an&#13;
appropriately qualified and experienced consulting engineering firm (the Consultants) to&#13;
provide the services described in these TOR. Part of the proceeds of the Credit will be used to&#13;
finance the provision of technical assistance and other consulting services. Consultants will&#13;
make maximum use of the personnel and capabilities of the PMU-SW and incur costs&#13;
associated with necessary equipment, facilities and supplies, and upgrading of skills for the staff&#13;
of PMU-SW.&#13;
OBJECTiVES AND SCOPE.&#13;
12.   The general objectives of the consulting services are to assist PMU-SW in procuring&#13;
and supervising the implementation of the investments to be financed under the proposed&#13;
Inland Waterways and Port Rehabilitation Project, and to provide training to VIWA/SD and&#13;
PMU-SW in project implementation and waterway management. Specific objectives include:&#13;
(a) to assist PMU-SW in carrying out pre-qualification to select qualified and&#13;
experienced organizations, foreign and domestic, to complete the work required, based on&#13;
criteria such as personnel, equipment, experience, financial resources and other factors.&#13;

INLAND WATERWAYS AND PORT REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Environmental Assessment and Action Plan Summary&#13;
A.   BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    This is a Category A project. An environmental assessment (EA) was carried out&#13;
for the Inland Waterways Sub-project, and an environmental analysis was conducted for&#13;
the Can Tho Port Component, the findings from which were used to formulate an&#13;
Environmental Management Action Plan (EMAP) for the project. The studies were&#13;
completed in February 1996, and a Final Report was submitted to the Bank in November&#13;
1996. The environmental work was coordinated by the PMIT-SW in collaboration with&#13;
Netherlands Engineering Consultants (NEDECO).&#13;
2.    Supporting Studies. The process of environmental review involved inputs from&#13;
various units in the region, including the:&#13;
(a) Faculty of Fisheries of Can Tho University for the macro-fauna study;&#13;
(b) Aquaculture Research Institute No. 2 for water quality analyses;&#13;
(c) Environmental Protection Center and the Hau Giang Provincial Department&#13;
of Sciences for heavy metal and pesticide analyses in canal sediment and&#13;
water;&#13;
(d) Institute of Applied Mechanics in HCMC modeled the hydraulics and salinity&#13;
of the canal system;&#13;
(e) National Institute of Agriculture in HCMC prepared a soil map of the&#13;
Mekong Delta and the University of Can Tho prepared a soil map of the&#13;
Trans Bassac area following USDA soil classifications which detailed the&#13;
degree to which the excavated materials are comprised of potentially or&#13;
actually acid sulfate soils along all stretches of the canals proposed for&#13;
rehabilitation;&#13;
(f) PMU-SW prepared a land use survey along the canal stretched proposed for&#13;
improvement; and&#13;
(g) PMU-SW also prepared a detailed "Environmental Monitoring Plan" dated&#13;
November 1996 for the Inland Waterways sub-project.&#13;
(h) The information and findings in these reports were used in the formulation of&#13;
an Environmental Management Action Plan to mitigate potential adverse&#13;
environmental impacts due to civil works activities during construction and&#13;
subsequent operation of the waterways and Can Tho Port.&#13;
&#13;

Page 2 of 8&#13;
3.    National Laws and Guidelines.  The Government of Vietnam's Ministry of&#13;
Environment, Science and Technology established ten environmental quality standards&#13;
(TCVN 5937, 5939, and 5940 for ambient, hazardous substance, inorganic substances and&#13;
dust, and organic substance concentrations for air quality; TCVN 5941 for soil quality;&#13;
5942, 5943, and 5944 for surface, coastal, and ground water quality, respectively; and&#13;
TCVN 5945 for industrial wastewater discharge and TCVN 5946 for waste paper)&#13;
pursuant to the State Law of Goods Quality and Decree 22. In part due to the recent&#13;
formulation and enactment of these standards, the capacity to enforce them is weak at&#13;
present in Vietnam; however, as the importance of good environmental quality&#13;
management is gaining support as a high priority, enforcement capacities are being&#13;
strengthened. The awareness for environmental protection and conservation has been&#13;
promoted in the media.  Project implementation would comply with all GOV&#13;
environmental standards.&#13;
B.   POTENTIAL IMPACTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES&#13;
4.    The potential key impacts and planned mitigation measures are reviewed in&#13;
paragraphs 3.26 to 3.32 in the main text. For the Inland Waterways component, the major&#13;
short-term impacts include increased acidification of canal water due to excavation of&#13;
pyritic soils which could adversely affect agriculture, fisheries, and other aquatic life and&#13;
the re-suspension of settled heavy metals and pesticides. The major medium- and long-&#13;
term impacts include increased salinity due to higher volumes of water flow, loss of&#13;
agricultural area and housing due to land acquisition for canal widening and deposition of&#13;
excavated spoil, and an increase in ships' wastes (primarily garbage, sewage and oily bilge&#13;
water) due to increased canal traffic. For the Can Tho Port component, the impacts&#13;
include increased quantities of oily water due to surface run-off and bilge discharge, and&#13;
increased quantities of ships' sewage and solid wastes. These potential impacts are&#13;
described with recommended mitigation measures and responsibilities in Table AS. 1 which&#13;
summarizes the Environmental Management Action Plan (EMAP). The EMAP specifies&#13;
the actions, monitoring indicators and institutional arrangements required to mitigate&#13;
potential environmental impacts during the construction and operation of the project.&#13;
Table 1 also details the specific monitoring and mitigation responsibilities for the&#13;
implementation of each task under the EMAP.&#13;
C. ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING&#13;
5.    The Environmental Protection Center (EPC) has been identified to monitor&#13;
potential environmental impacts. EPC would regularly report the environmental status&#13;
based on site visits, public consultation, and water and soil core sampling and testing. In&#13;
addition, the EPC would conduct detailed canal-bottom core sampling to determine in&#13;
advance potential impacts from disturbing the substrate and suggest construction methods,&#13;
as needed, which would minimize adverse impacts.&#13;

Page 3 of 8&#13;
D. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
6.    MOT would have overall responsibility for implementing the project through&#13;
PMU-SW. Accordingly, concerning environmental impacts, administrative arrangements&#13;
have been established between the PMU-SW, contractors and local authorities including&#13;
NGOs, Provincial Science, Technology and Environment Departments (PMSTEs),&#13;
provincial PCs and EPC. EPC, an independent environmental monitoring agency, would&#13;
regularly report environmental status. Similarly, the Faculty of Fisheries of Can Tho&#13;
University (FFCTU) would conduct macro-fauna surveys to observe what ecological and&#13;
economic impacts project activities may have upon aquatic life. PMU-SW and the&#13;
PMSTEs will jointly resolve all grievances during project implementation.&#13;

INLAND WATERWAYS AND PORT REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Summary Resettlement Action Plan&#13;
Background and Summary&#13;
1.1   The Waterway Improvements component of the project will require the&#13;
acquisition of land and other assets of households settled along the banks of the canals to&#13;
be widened and in areas where dredge spoil will be deposited. A draft Resettlement&#13;
Action Plan (RAP), prepared in July 1994 on the basis of (a) original design parameters&#13;
(30 m shipping lane; two-sided dredging), (b) census and measurement of affected&#13;
structures, and (c) a socioeconomic survey (see below), indicated that about 6,000&#13;
households located along the canal banks would be affected by the project, of which&#13;
about 3,000 would need to be relocated. The related costs were estimated at US$18.31&#13;
million.&#13;
1.2   A participatory project definition workshop raised concern over the number of&#13;
project affected families (PAF) and the cost of resettlement. It was therefore decided to&#13;
revise the design parameters of the canal in densely-populated areas to reduce the&#13;
resettlement impact. The revised parameters included: (a) reducing the design width of&#13;
shipping lanes from 30 meters to 26 meters (for the Lap Vo Sa Dec, Cai San-Kien Luong&#13;
waterways) and 22 meters (for the CanTho-Ca Mau waterways), so that widening varies&#13;
between 1 and 12 meters; (b) dredging on only one side of canals, where possible,&#13;
(c) construction of a bypass canal at Rach Gia, and (d) ending waterway improvements&#13;
before the town of Ca Mau and building a landing stage there.&#13;
1.3   A revised Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the Inland Waterways was&#13;
subsequently prepared based on the revised design parameters and an updated socio-&#13;
economic survey and census of PAFs. The revised RAP indicated that the number of&#13;
PAFs would be reduced to 4,959, of which only 1,280 would need to be relocated, at a&#13;
cost of US$10.5 million equivalent. Additionally the cost of compensation for affected&#13;
assets due to the dredged spoil is estimated at US$1.35 million.&#13;
Organizational Responsibilities&#13;
1.4   PMU-SW will undertake functions of an executing agency and through Project&#13;
Resettlement Committee will be responsible for coordinating all resettlement activities&#13;
with provincial, district and local authorities and PAPs, and for monitoring the progress.&#13;
The PMU will establish a Project Resettlement Committee, chaired by the Deputy&#13;
Director of PMU-SW. The People's Committees of the affected provinces will set up&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-71 -&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 2 of 8&#13;
Provincial Resettlement Committees (PRCs) to be chaired by the Vice-Chairman of the&#13;
respective provinces. Each PRC will be assisted by District and Village Resettlement&#13;
Committees. The Project Resettlement Committee will be assisted by the following Task&#13;
Forces:&#13;
-     Property Evaluation TF&#13;
-     Compensation TF&#13;
-     Resettlement TF&#13;
-     Monitoring TF&#13;
1.5   Each task force will be responsible for coordination of their activities with the&#13;
provincial, district and village resettlement committees and overall management and&#13;
implementation of RAP. Each task force will submit monthly progress reports and&#13;
periodic monitoring reports to the Project Resettlement Committee.&#13;
Socioeconomic Survey&#13;
1.6   To determine the amount of resettlement required, PMU-SW conducted a door-to-&#13;
door census and socio-economic survey covering the five provinces affected by the&#13;
project (An Giang, Can Tho, Dong Thap, Kien Giang and Minh Hai). The census&#13;
registered names, locations and occupations of all families living within 20 meters of the&#13;
waterway bank. It also measured distances between waterway banks and houses/&#13;
homesteads, and other losses expected from waterway widening (such as land holdings,&#13;
animals, trees, wells and graves). The socioeconomic survey covered 30% of the families&#13;
and focused on family composition, occupation, income, access to utilities and public&#13;
facilities. Peoples' attitude towards land-for-land or cash compensation was also&#13;
investigated during the socio-economic survey. In November 1995, after discussions&#13;
with PMU-SW, an additional census covering 100% households, and socio-economic&#13;
survey covering 30% sample households situated within 30 meters of waterway banks&#13;
was conducted.&#13;
Affected Families&#13;
1.7   A total of 4,959 families are expected to be affected by the project (using revised&#13;
parameters), of which 1,280 are expected to opt for resettlement. The remaining 3,679&#13;
families are expected to lose only partial assets (land and buildings) but will not be&#13;
displaced. No loss of agricultural land was recorded. However, acquisition of some&#13;
agricultural land may be necessary for smoothening of the bends in the Tat Cay Tram and&#13;
in the Trem Canh Den canal and for construction of houses which may need to move&#13;
back from their present location and reorganize. A provision for acquisition of 50 ha is&#13;
included in the RAP.&#13;

Occupations and Incomes&#13;
1.8   Families affected by the project include farmers (53.5%/o), traders (30.0%),&#13;
seasonal laborers (10.0%), and others. Many households live on the embankment or over&#13;
the water. Average family size is 5.7 of which 2.7 are of working age. Drinking water&#13;
supply and sanitation are poor. Average annual incomes of affected families have&#13;
increased recently with increased private-sector trading activities and multiple cropping.&#13;
Socio-economic survey indicates existence of Khmer and Cham ethnic groups among the&#13;
PAPs. However, these ethnic groups are well integrated with Kinh society, both socially&#13;
and economically.&#13;
Objectives of the RAP&#13;
1.9   The RAP was prepared taking in to consideration prevailing laws and regulations&#13;
in Vietnam and World Bank Operational Directive 4.30, Involuntary Resettlement. The&#13;
main objectives are as follows:&#13;
a   Involuntary resettlement will be avoided or minimized, where possible, by&#13;
modifying project design and exploring technical alternatives.&#13;
*   All PAFs residing or cultivating land in the project areas as of the date of&#13;
census, November 1995, will be entitled to compensation and resettlement&#13;
and rehabilitation benefits. Lack of land use right certificate will not bar any&#13;
PAF from these entitlements.&#13;
PAFs will be compensated, resettled and rehabilitated so as to improve their&#13;
standard of living or at least restore it to pre-project levels.&#13;
All compensation for lost assets will be based on the principle of&#13;
replacement cost. All the PAFs will be entitled to compensation at&#13;
replacement cost for affected buildings and other attached assets; cash&#13;
compensation for affected land, or in lieu of cash, land of equivalent size&#13;
and productivity (in the case of agricultural land) at location acceptable to&#13;
PAF; and transfer allowance, subsistence allowance, employment and&#13;
training assistance.&#13;
*   Replacement land, residential and agricultural, as the case may be, will be as&#13;
close as possible to the affected land and acceptable to PAFs. An effort will&#13;
be made to relocate existing communities as a group with minimum&#13;
disruption to their existing social ties.&#13;
*   The resettlement transition period will be minimnized and the land-for-land&#13;
and/or cash compensation will be provided to PAFs at least one month prior&#13;
to the start-up date of works in the respective section. The sites for&#13;
relocation will be fully developed with public facilities and services prior to&#13;
the shifting of PAFs.&#13;
*   Resettlement and land acquisition plans will be implemented through an&#13;
effective public participation and consultation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 4 of 8&#13;
*   Financial and  physical resources  required  for land  acquisition,&#13;
compensation, resettlement and rehabilitation will be made available as and&#13;
when necessary and according to the implementation schedule outlined in&#13;
the RAP.&#13;
*   Institutional arrangements will ensure effective and timely design, planning&#13;
and implementation of the RAP.&#13;
*   Internal and external monitoring will be provided on the implementation of&#13;
the RAP.&#13;
Inventory of Assets&#13;
1.10 Upon completion of the technical designs, during the implementation stage field&#13;
surveys will be carried out to accurately determine the land and building areas affected by&#13;
the project and to further refine the data. During the interviews conducted in November&#13;
1995 almost all the PAFs expressed their preference for cash options. However, at that&#13;
stage PAFs were not informed of detailed compensation policy and their entitlements.&#13;
Many displaced PAFs may opt for the land-for-land option if provided with fully&#13;
developed plots at suitable locations together with long-term security of tenure. Re-&#13;
confirmation on PAPs choices for cash or land-for-land options would also be obtained to&#13;
enable selection and development of resettlement sites.&#13;
Compensation Policy&#13;
1.11 The general policy governing compensation to PAFs for all types of affected&#13;
assets includes the following:&#13;
*   All PAFs covered in the November 1995 census will be entitled to&#13;
compensation for their lost assets, incomes and businesses.   No&#13;
differentiation shall be made according to the legal status of the families&#13;
registered. In addition, all the families who acquire assets legally within the&#13;
project area and those obtain permits to build after the cut-off date will also&#13;
be entitled to compensation in accordance with the policy.&#13;
*   Compensation shall be paid for all additional works and attached assets to&#13;
houses/structures such as electric connection, compound walls, water&#13;
connections and meters, trees, graves, wells, etc.&#13;
*   Compensation for partially affected assets will be given in cash if less than&#13;
20% of assets or incomes are affected and the remaining assets are viable for&#13;
continued use. For partially affected structures the compensation can be&#13;
effected through the provision of building material in lieu of cash.&#13;
*   Compensation for loss of homestead area will be calculated on the basis of&#13;
Decree CP90, based on the rates stipulated in Resolution CP87 and&#13;
confirmed by the provincial people's committees for the respective&#13;
provinces. However, it will be ensured that all compensation will be at&#13;
replacement cost.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-74 -                           Annex 6&#13;
Page 5 of 8&#13;
* PAFs retaining a homestead of less than 60 sq.m. will be entitled to&#13;
compensation for the entire holding and other assets thereon at replacement&#13;
cost or for resettlement and rehabilitation benefits.  Where possible,&#13;
additional land will be acquired at the present location to enable these PAFs&#13;
to reorganize without any need for relocation.&#13;
*   PAFs losing more than 20% of their total land holding or household incomes&#13;
shall be compensated by replacement land of equal productive potential at&#13;
locations acceptable to PAFs or, at the request of the PAPs cash&#13;
compensation.&#13;
*   Tenants leasing land will be given an equivalent plot of land for the&#13;
remaining lease period or will be compensated in cash for the loss of&#13;
income.&#13;
*   Compensation rates for land shall be based on Decree CP90 provided that&#13;
the compensation paid represents replacement cost.&#13;
*   Farmers whose land is taken for dredged material disposal will receive cash&#13;
compensation for a full year's value of crops, provided that after one year&#13;
the land retains its productivity to the pre-project level. In case the land&#13;
becomes unviable for continued use even after one year, it will be acquired&#13;
and the PAF will be paid cash compensation or given a replacement land of&#13;
equivalent size and productivity at location acceptable to PAF.&#13;
*   Families wishing to acquire plots and houses in a location other than the&#13;
new settlement area can be compensated in cash. Payments shall be made to&#13;
the seller of the new homestead after the compensation committee has&#13;
verified and approved the new location.&#13;
*   PAFs whose only partial assets are affected but who are not displaced will&#13;
receive a subsistence allowance in kind (rice) for a period of three months.&#13;
All the relocated families will be entitled to a subsistence allowance for a&#13;
period of six months.&#13;
*   All the displaced and relocated families will receive assistance in moving to&#13;
the new settlement area to a maximum amount of US$30 equivalent per&#13;
family. The assistance shall be provided in the form of transport facilities or&#13;
cash.&#13;
*   One person per PAF in the age-group of 17-21 years and displaced by the&#13;
project will be entitled to training assistance. Payment for training programs&#13;
will be made directly to the selected training institutes. In general, US$100&#13;
per person is allocated for training and at least 30% of the training assistance&#13;
will be reserved for women. During the training period PAF will be entitled&#13;
to training subsistence allowance equivalent in value to US$30 per month&#13;
for a maximum of three months.&#13;
Public Participation and Consultation&#13;
1.12 A participatory approach has been used in project preparation and will continue to&#13;
be applied during its implementation. In 1994, meetings were held with the planning&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -                         Annexi6&#13;
Page 6 of 8&#13;
committees of all of the relevant provincial Peoples' Committees to discuss the scope and&#13;
consequences of the project. Similar discussions were held in 1995. Local census takers&#13;
were trained and the project was explained to government authorities in the villages along&#13;
the canal routes to be widened. During the census and socio-economic survey PAPs were&#13;
explained the objectives of the project and general compensation policy. PAPs were also&#13;
informed of the land-for-land and cash options. In February, 1996, a project planning&#13;
workshop was held in Can Tho which included the Project Steering Committee and the&#13;
Provincial Peoples' Committees. Following this workshop, PMU-SW revised the scope&#13;
of the project which resulted in a reduced number of PAFs.&#13;
1.13 Upon final approval of the RAP by the Bank and GOV, the PMU's Resettlement&#13;
Committee in cooperation with the provincial and district Resettlement Committees will&#13;
launch a major infonnation campaign. The public information campaign, comprising&#13;
distribution of a public information booklet, newspaper advertisements and general public&#13;
meetings within the project areas, is planned at least one year prior to the implementation&#13;
of the RAP and would include descriptions of:&#13;
Project objectives and likely impacts on the existing settlements and&#13;
population;&#13;
*   Compensation policy, rehabilitation assistance, compensation rates for all&#13;
types of lost assets, and entitlements; and&#13;
*   The location of resettlement areas and information regarding the level of&#13;
services and facilities to be provided on these locations.&#13;
1.14  The PMU Resettlement Committee will ensure that local authorities and&#13;
representatives of PAFs are regularly consulted at all stages of the project and participate&#13;
in the planning and decision making process.&#13;
Grievance Redress Mechanism&#13;
1.15 RAP recommends a well structured grievance redressal mechanism whereby PAFs&#13;
can air their grievances with the Property Evaluation Committee and the Chairman of the&#13;
Village Peoples Committee. PAPs may further appeal to the District Peoples Committee.&#13;
As a last resort, PAPs can appeal to the Provincial Peoples Committee.&#13;
Implementation Schedule&#13;
1.16  Presently four out of the five provinces have identified relocation sites for the&#13;
resettlement of PAFs to be displaced by the project. The Kien Giang province is&#13;
requested to tentatively identify suitable relocation sites prior to the finalization of the&#13;
RAP. Each of these sites will be further evaluated during the implementation of the RAP&#13;
for their suitability for relocation as well as their acceptability by PAFs for relocation. A&#13;
small pilot project for training and testing of implementation procedures has been carried&#13;
out by PMU-SW and the provincial People's Committees with an objective to train the&#13;
relevant staff in the implementation of the RAP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-76 -                           Annex 6&#13;
Page 7 of 8&#13;
1.17 Upon Board approval, the PMU Project Resettlement Committee, the provincial&#13;
and district resettlement committees and related task forces will prepare detailed&#13;
Provincial Resettlement Plans including detailed time bound resettlement activities.&#13;
PMU will contract a Monitoring Agent (who has already been identified). A public&#13;
information campaign, detailed measurement survey and an attitude survey will be carried&#13;
out again to further refine the data for the first phase of project works. Based on these&#13;
surveys the required amount of land for resettlement will be determined, and the site will&#13;
be acquired and improved. PAFs would be compensated and resettled at least one month&#13;
prior to start up of the civil works on the selected section. Project effectiveness is&#13;
expected in late 1997 at which time the contracts for dredging would also be ready for&#13;
execution.&#13;
Supervision and Monitoring&#13;
1.18 Besides the internal monitoring for the implementation of Resettlement Action&#13;
Plan by the Project Resettlement Committee, external monitoring will be carried out by&#13;
an independent agency. Terms of Reference for external monitoring will be prepared&#13;
after the approval of the RAP by GOV. Monitoring agency will be appointed within&#13;
three months of the Board's approval. Main responsibilities of the monitoring agency will&#13;
be to:&#13;
*   review the detailed resettlement plans prepared by provinces;&#13;
*   review the implementation schedules and preparatory time given to PAPs;&#13;
*   monitor compensation amounts paid to the PAFs in accordance with the&#13;
policies and the time of payments;&#13;
*   assess adherence to GOV and World Bank policies for resettlement;&#13;
*   review adequacy of grievance redressal procedures;&#13;
3   inspect proposed resettlement sites and the completeness of infrastructure;&#13;
and&#13;
*   review standard of living of relocated persons/businesses.&#13;
1.19 Monitoring agency will be required to submit an inception report within one&#13;
month after its appointment and quarterly progress reports to PMU-SW and to the Bank&#13;
for review.&#13;
Costs and Budget&#13;
1.20 Based on the modified design parameters, the total cost of resettlement is&#13;
estimated at US$10.5 million, including 5% contingencies. The total cost may vary&#13;
slightly after the compensation policy is fine-tuned to meet all the requirements of&#13;
OD 4.30. In addition an amount of US$1.35 million is provided for to meet the&#13;
compensation costs for assets affected by the dredged spoil. A detailed breakdown of&#13;
resettlement costs is given in Table A-1.&#13;

INLAND WATERWAYS AND PORT REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Economic Evaluation&#13;
A.   INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    The economic evaluation comprises the two main components of the proposed&#13;
project defined in Chapter 3 of this report: the rehabilitation and modernization of the&#13;
inland waterway corridors in the Mekong Delta and the rehabilitation and modernization&#13;
of the Port of Can Tho.  A separate economic analysis was performed for the&#13;
modernization of the navigation aids system on the project waterways.&#13;
B.    INLAND WATERWAYS AND NAVIGATION AIDS&#13;
Traffic Forecast&#13;
2.    The traffic forecasts for the inland waterways (with and without navigation aids)&#13;
are based on the Mekong Delta Master Plan, submitted to and approved by the GOV at&#13;
the end of 1993. Subsequent economic developments in the Mekong Delta have been&#13;
incorporated in the updated version of the traffic forecast.&#13;
3.    The traffic forecasts were prepared taking into account socio-economic factors&#13;
such as population growth rate, overall economic indices (e.g., regional GDP) as well as&#13;
product studies related to nine major commodity groups produced or consumed in the&#13;
Mekong Delta (rice, construction materials, fertilizer, food, timber and timber products,&#13;
POL products, coal, machinery and industrial products, and consumer goods). Based on&#13;
these studies origin and destination matrices (including modal split) were developed for&#13;
low case and base case traffic scenarios, projected to the horizon years 2000, 2015 and&#13;
2020 and interpolated for the other years (see the table below).&#13;

4.    Waterborne freight traffic in the Mekong Delta is projected to grow at about 9%&#13;
per annum in 1994-2000 (5% p.a. in the low case) and between 3% - 4% per annum in&#13;
2000-2020. With the project, the modal share of waterways is expected to hold steady at&#13;
65% until the year 2000, then decrease to 58% in 2020. The project waterways are&#13;
expected to retain 60% of Delta waterway traffic throughout the period.&#13;
5.    In contrast to freight, passenger transport is dominated by road, reflecting the&#13;
preference of travelers for fast door-to-door transport, despite higher tariffs. In 1991, the&#13;
observed modal split was at 74% road transport and 26% waterways (39.2 million and&#13;
13.1 million passengers, respectively), excluding non-commercial passenger transport.&#13;
With the expected future improvement of road infrastructure and the quality of road&#13;
passenger transport, the modal share of passenger traffic on waterways is expected to&#13;
decrease to about 19.7% by the year 2000 and to about 9.0% by the year 2015.&#13;
Assessment of Costs and Benefits&#13;
Waterway Rehabilitation and Modernization&#13;
6.    Costs: The economic costs of the waterway improvements component consist of&#13;
capital and operating and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs. Capital costs comprise the physical&#13;
works (e.g., capital dredging, widening, resettlement, navigation aids) for each investment&#13;
alternative at their economic cost, measured as the unit cost of equivalent works in&#13;
international markets. O&amp;M costs are based on an assessment of the resources required at&#13;
international prices to keep the waterways in optimal working condition.&#13;
7.    Benefits: The quantifiable benefits of the proposed project consist principally of&#13;
reductions in vessel operating costs for freight traffic and the avoided cost of freight traffic&#13;
diversion from the inland waterways to roads'.&#13;
8.    Reductions in vessel operating costs are based on an assessment of the future&#13;
freight fleet composition, which in turn depends on a number of physical and operating&#13;
characteristics (including the least available depth, overhead clearance, year-round and day&#13;
and night navigability, vessel characteristics and fleet mix, traffic characteristics such as&#13;
volume, flow and nature of cargo traffic). An inland waterway transport cost model&#13;
(IWTC Model) for the Mekong Delta Master Plan Study was used to estimate operating&#13;
costs per ton and ton/km as well as total fleet costs for various waterway development&#13;
options and fleet configurations. In addition, several fleet operating indicators such as&#13;
fleet productivity (ton/dwt) and fleet capacity required by cargo volume were calculated.&#13;
9.    The avoided cost of freight traffic diversion to roads is measured as the difference&#13;
between vehicle operating costs on the road network typical for the Mekong Delta&#13;
(adjusted for improvements, where appropriate) and the vessel operating costs resulting&#13;
1 Although passengers will benefit from the proposed improvements, these benefits would be&#13;
marginal compared with benefits to be realized by freight transport. With this view, they have been&#13;
excluded from the economic evaluation.&#13;
&#13;

from the improved waterways. Vehicle operating cost estimates were adopted from&#13;
recently completed studies and the Bank projects in the Mekong Delta.2.&#13;
Navigation Aids&#13;
10.   Costs: The economic costs included in the evaluation comprise civil works, new&#13;
equipment and annual O&amp;M costs related to navigation aids..&#13;
11.   Benefits:  The main quantifiable economic benefit of introducing modem&#13;
navigation aids would be an increase in the cargo transporting capacity of the waterways&#13;
and vessels, due in particular to the introduction of night navigation. Other important&#13;
benefits not measured in this analysis include improved safety and reliability of inland&#13;
navigation and the avoided costs of investing in additional vessels (para. 13).&#13;
12.   It should be noted that the optimal benefit results from the combined effect of&#13;
modem navigation aids and the rehabilitation of the waterways. Without navigation aids,&#13;
the project waterways would become congested around the turn of the century3, even with&#13;
the proposed improvements to the waterways. Night freight traffic in the year 2000 is&#13;
estimated at 1.3 million tons for the low case and 1.6 million tons for the base case&#13;
scenarios. It is projected to grow by 3% p.a. thereafter.&#13;
13.   The introduction of night navigation would reduce additional fleet capacity&#13;
requirements by 10%-15% (equivalent to 8,000 to 12,000 dwt). For the above estimation&#13;
the IWCT model used the following the fleet configuration: (a) barge convoys consisting&#13;
of a 200-250 HP tug and three 250-300 dwt barges; (b) wooden vessels of 65 dwt; and&#13;
(c) self-propelled steel hull vessels of 300 dwt. It has been assumed that about 50% of the&#13;
barge fleet will use the night navigation option, corresponding to 23.5% of current long&#13;
haul fleet capacity. For the average 200 km trip, the productivity of the design convoy&#13;
could be increased from 21 trips per year to 28 trips per year resulting in a 20% reduction&#13;
in transport costs from about US$4.8 per ton to US$3.9 per ton.&#13;
Choice of Development Option&#13;
14.   From an initial screening of fifteen project alternatives, seven were selected for&#13;
detailed evaluation. Among these, six consider alternative route improvement scenarios&#13;
for the waterways and one represents a maritime alternative for large quantities of cement&#13;
and clinker transport between Kien Luong and HCMC. The main features of these&#13;
options are summarized below.&#13;

15.   Option 1: Preservation of the Status Quo: This option represented the "without"&#13;
improvement case, with the existing water depth and the current level of maintenance&#13;
dredging. No capital dredging or other capital expenditure were considered. This option&#13;
comprised the segments HCMC - Can Tho; Can Tho - Ca Mau via Bac Lieu (South-East&#13;
route) and between HCMC and Kien Luong via the Sa Dec canal (Northern route).&#13;
Under this option, vessel operating costs increase significantly and the fleet capacity was&#13;
fully used by 1999. It would also cause substantial diversion of traffic from waterways to&#13;
more costly roads.&#13;
16.   Option 2: Rehabilitation of the Present Main Waterways to Obtain 50% (1009%)&#13;
Navigability. This option assumed that the waterways considered under Option 1 will be&#13;
rehabilitated. A partial rehabilitation scenario (50% navigability) was also compared with&#13;
the full rehabilitation case (100% navigability).&#13;
17.   Option 3: Rehabilitation of Main Waterways via Quan Lo- Phung Hiep and Lap&#13;
Vo - Sa Dec Canals to Obtain 100% Navigability. This option is identical to the previous&#13;
option, except that the route Ca Mau - Can Tho follows the Quan Lo -Phung Hiep&#13;
segment instead of the southern route via Bac Lieu.&#13;
18.   Option 4: Improvement of the Main Waterways via Quan Lo - Phung Hiep. This&#13;
option is identical to Option 2, except that the rehabilitation of the Lap Vo - Sa Dec canal&#13;
is replaced by the Quan Lo - Phung Hiep canal.&#13;
19.   Option 5: Improvement of the Main Waterways via Xa No - Ca Mau Route and&#13;
Lap Vo - Sa Dec Canal. This option is identical to Option 2, except that the southern&#13;
route to Can Tho/HCMC via Bac Lieu is replaced by a more central route, from Ca Mau&#13;
to Can Tho via the Xa No canal and that the Lap Vo - Sa Dec canal is assumed to be&#13;
along the northern route to Kien Luong (see Map). The southern route via Bac Lieu will&#13;
be maintained to existing standards.&#13;
20.   Option 6: Improvement of the Main Waterways Excluding the Rach Soi - Hau&#13;
Giang Segment on the Northern Route to Kien Luong. This option is identical to&#13;
Option 5, excluding the segment Rach Soi - Hau Gian, but including the river stretch Rach&#13;
Gia - Cai Lon. The southern route via Bac Lieu and the Lap Vo - Sa Dec canal will be&#13;
maintained to existing standards.&#13;
21.   Option 7: Improvement of southern waterways from HCMC via Can Tho and Xa&#13;
No canal to Ca Mau and replacement of northern route by maritime transport from Kien&#13;
Luong to HCMC via Vung Tau. The southern route to Ca Mau via the Xa No canal is&#13;
assumed to be rehabilitated and the northern canal to Kien Luong is maintained to existing&#13;
standards. Large quantities of clinker and cement produced in Kien Luong is assumed to&#13;
be transported by sea going vessels to places of consumption in the Vung Tau/HCMC&#13;
areas.&#13;

Evaluation of the Most Promising Option (Option 5)&#13;
22.   Option 5 was selected for further consideration because it yielded the highest NPV&#13;
and incremental cost/benefit ratio.  Furthermore, this option supported the GOV's&#13;
development strategy for the Mekong Delta, with the city of Can Tho as its geographical&#13;
center. The Xa No canal passes Can Tho directly. By contrast, most other routes are far&#13;
from Can Tho, traverse areas of less economic potential and cause more resettlement&#13;
needs. In one instance a route (Quang Ho - Phung Hiep) interfered with aquaculture and&#13;
water control projects.&#13;
23.   The economic analysis for Option 5 is summarized below for the following&#13;
variants: (a) the project as described in Option 5, with 24 hour navigability (base case);&#13;
(b) the two principal waterway segments treated separately, i.e., HCMC-Tho-Kien Luong&#13;
and Can Tho - Ca Mau; and (c) a separate evaluation of the night navaids on the project&#13;
waterways.&#13;
24.   The results of the "without" and "with" project analysis of the base case are&#13;
presented in Table Al1.5, attached. Although the useful life of the investments extends&#13;
well beyond 2020, for simplicity's sake a residual value of 20% of the original investment&#13;
(i.e., US$12.8 million) was assumed at the end of the evaluation period. . The NPV,&#13;
discounted at an opportunity cost of capital of 10%) and IRR for the project as a whole&#13;
are satisfactory (NPV of US$81 million and an IRR of 26%).&#13;
25.   The separate analysis of the two principal waterway segments also showed&#13;
satisfactory results. In the case of the HCMC-Can Tho-Kien Luong segment, the NPV is&#13;
US$57 million and the IRR 27% while the Can Tho-Ca Mau segment yields an NPV of&#13;
US$24 million and a slightly lower IRR of 24% (Tables Al 1.6 and Al 1.7) because of its&#13;
lower traffic density.&#13;
26.   The valuation of the night navigation system (Table Al 1.8) is based on the&#13;
incremental costs for night navigation, estimated at US$4.03 million in capital costs and&#13;
US$190,000 in yearly maintenance costs. The benefits are represented by the difference in&#13;
vessel operating costs with and without night navigation, i.e., US$0.80 per ton. The&#13;
additional investment in night navigation aids is economically justified, with a NPV of&#13;
US$8 million and an IRR of 28.9% for the base case.&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
27.   The sensitivity analysis presented below examines the effect of variations in the&#13;
following key parameters on the project's economic rate of return:&#13;
(a)   Increase in Capital Costs by 20 percent: A potential capital cost increase&#13;
of up to 20 percent over and above a 10 percent allowance for physical contingencies on&#13;
civil works.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 6 of 15&#13;
(b)   Project Delay by One Year: Even though the nature of works are not&#13;
complex the likelihood for one year delay can not be excluded in light of the recent&#13;
experience with Bank projects.&#13;
(c)   Increase in Estimated Vessel Operating Costs by 10 percent:  The&#13;
computed value of the vessel operating costs (VOC) with the project assuming no change&#13;
in the existing fleet mix was increased by 10 percent. VOC is a sensitive parameter. The&#13;
above assumption is very conservative given that there will be substantial gains in travel&#13;
time, fleet productivity and change in the fleet mix in favor of high capacity barges using&#13;
the project waterways.&#13;
(d)   Low Traffic Scenario: Although waterway traffic in the Mekong Delta has&#13;
exceeded forecasts in the past it is assumed that only the low traffic scenario (para. 3) will&#13;
materialize.&#13;
(e)   10 percent Traffic Diversion to Road instead of 20 percent without&#13;
project: It is assumed that without the project by 2010 the level of waterways traffic&#13;
diversion to road will be lower than the Base case assumption.&#13;
(f)    Combined Effect of the scenarios (a) to(d):  Under this scenario the&#13;
combined effect of all above assumptions excluding (e) was evaluated.&#13;
28.   Table Al 1.2 summarizes the results of the analysis. The most pessimistic scenario&#13;
(f) would yield a relatively low, but still satisfactory economic return (NPV US$33&#13;
million, JRR 15%). The switching value for the most sensitive parameter, vessel operating&#13;
cost, would be an increase in unit costs by 24% which is very unlikely with project&#13;
improvements.&#13;

C.   Can Tho Port Component&#13;
Introduction&#13;
29.   At present the Port of Can Tho, situated about 75 km upstream from the mouth of&#13;
the Bassac, is a small river port with a theoretical design capacity of about 600,000 tons&#13;
per year. Throughput has fluctuated in the past between 54,000 tons (1993) and 183,000&#13;
tons (1996). Until 1994 the port also handled a small number of containers, but this trade&#13;
has dried up due to insufficient volume. The port is very dependent on two commodities,&#13;
rice (80% of 1995 throughput) and cement (12% of 1995 throughput), and is therefore&#13;
subject to variations in their market conditions. The port is heavily dependent on one&#13;
customer (Vinafood) which has started to use the port as its main outlet for the export of&#13;
rice.&#13;
30.   The major competitor of the Port of Can Tho is the Port of Saigon in HCMC&#13;
which can handle ships of up to 18,000 dwt. Moreover, HCMC has the added advantage&#13;
of a developed transport, communication, business and administrative infrastructure which&#13;
facilitates trade and attract its potential users.  Furthermore, the majority of grain&#13;
merchants and other traders have their offices and warehouses in HCMC where they can&#13;
store, grade and further process their merchandise. In addition, due to a shortage of&#13;
milling capacity in the Delta, and in order to preserve their working capital, grain&#13;
merchants prefer to ship unmilled rice to HCMC for immediate resale to the major milling&#13;
companies. Thus, the historic trade pattern for commodities leaving or entering the&#13;
Mekong Delta has been via HCMC and the inland waterways connecting the delta with&#13;
HCMC.&#13;
31.   Although the Port of Can Tho is located in the center of the Mekong Delta, only&#13;
relatively small ships (drafts of about 3 m or about 7,000 dwt) can use it on a regular basis&#13;
because of siltation at the mouth of the Bassac River (Dinh An). However, vessels with a&#13;
draft of up to 7.5 m (fully laden) can access the port at high tide during the rainy season.&#13;
The long-term future of the port as a viable year-round alternative to the Port of Saigon&#13;
thus depends on the management of the siltation problem. At present a study is under way&#13;
which will determine whether a sustainable solution can be found.&#13;
Traffic Forecast&#13;
32.   The potential of the hinterland of the Port of Can Tho - the southern Mekong&#13;
Delta - to generate and attract traffic is substantial. In terms of agricultural production,&#13;
the southern delta area produces about 6 million tons of paddy (1994), of which almost&#13;
57% is consumed by the delta population. The remainder is available for use elsewhere in&#13;
Vietnam and for export. In addition, the region consumes about 3.1 million tons of other&#13;
goods, such as fertilizer, cement, steel and construction materials (1993), most of which&#13;
need to be transported from other areas of the country or imported from abroad.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 93 -                              Annex 1 1&#13;
Page 8 of 15&#13;
33.   About 85-90%  of the total Mekong Delta export and import traffic has been&#13;
handled by HCMC, mostly through the Port of Saigon. Rice produced in the delta is&#13;
transported to HCMC for further handling, local sale or export; and such commodities as&#13;
fertilizer, steel and machinery are imported via HCMC.&#13;
34.   Up to now Can Tho Port has been unable to exploit the transport potential of its&#13;
hinterland, due in part to the draft limitations at the mouth of the Bassac, but also because&#13;
of the weak physical and service infrastructure of Can Tho City and weaknesses in&#13;
commercial and marketing skills of the port itself Moreover, regulatory restrictions on&#13;
the marketing and exportation of rice (quotas for individual enterprises) prevent some&#13;
companies from increasing their shipments through Can Tho Port. Although the Port is&#13;
not expected to change the historic trade patterns between the Delta and HCMC&#13;
significantly, it has some prospects for diversifying its customer base and capturing a share&#13;
of the expected traffic growth with the proposed improvements in the port's&#13;
infrastructure, its management and operations and the implementation of the Mekong&#13;
Delta Master Plan.&#13;
35.   However, an added uncertainty regarding the commercial future of Can Tho Port&#13;
stems from proposals to establish one or two new public ports in the Can Tho area (one in&#13;
the planned EPZ zone adjacent to Can Tho Port and the second one further upstream). If&#13;
these proposals were realized, none of the ports, including the existing Can Tho Port,&#13;
would likely be economically and financially viable.&#13;
36.   In view of the above risks, it was considered prudent to develop three traffic&#13;
scenarios reflecting low, base and high growth assumptions.  A  summary of the&#13;
assumptions is provided in the matrix below. In the case of the new ports, a low traffic&#13;
scenario is assumed. Traffic projections for the three scenarios are presented in the table&#13;
below for the anchor years 2000 and 2015.&#13;

Calculation of Economic Return&#13;
38.   Since Can Tho Port's main competitors are the ports of the HCMC area, it is&#13;
important for Can Tho to offer shippers and shipping lines the highest quality service&#13;
possible since a reduced service standard would likely lead to a diversion of traffic via&#13;
inland waterways to HCMC, as is the case now. Assuming that the market would not&#13;
tolerate any deterioration in existing service standards, waiting times would have to be&#13;
kept constant. Therefore, the proposed investments for Can Tho Port are essential since&#13;
without them service standards cannot be maintained, let alone be made competitive.&#13;
39.   The economic analysis is based on the assumption that without an increase in the&#13;
quality of service the forecast traffic is unlikely to materialize. In particular, the existing&#13;
shore-based crane would become unreliable in about two years' time. This means that&#13;
ships could only load and unload cargo with their own gear. Using a berth occupancy&#13;
model, it was estimated that queuing times would increase by almost 50%, from an&#13;
aggregate 460 days to 670 days. Thus, in the year 2000, without the investments, Can&#13;
Tho Port would be able to handle only about 393,000 tons instead of the 572,000 tons of&#13;
cargo forecast in the base case, and the balance of 179,000 tons would be diverted to&#13;
HCMC's ports.4&#13;
40.   The economic cost of the cargo diverted to HCMC is assumed to be equal to the&#13;
cost of shipping rice (excluding extra handling) to HCMC, i.e., US$3.60 per ton. If cargo&#13;
were shipped by road, the cost would be even higher, i.e., about US$8.65 per ton. The&#13;
present analysis is based on the cost of waterway transport and thus is conservative.&#13;
41.   Table Al1.9 presents the results of the base traffic scenario based on the avoided&#13;
cost of waterway transport from Can Tho to HCMC as a measure of the benefit of&#13;
stemming from the improvements in Can Tho Port. Possible maintenance cost savings in&#13;
the past have not been included since they would be marginal. The economic life of the&#13;
investment has been assumed at 10 years, because a major overhaul for the new crane may&#13;
become necessary after 10 years. Benefits have been kept at the year 2000 level, the&#13;
maximum capacity the port could handle with its present layout. Any increases in traffic&#13;
beyond the year 2000 would require major expansion in port capacity. The investment&#13;
cost comprises the cost of improvements in fendering, lighting and pavement repair, and&#13;
the introduction of a mobile crane and a fork lift (details in Chapter 3). A physical&#13;
contingency of 10% of the above costs is also included. The NPV calculation is based on&#13;
Bank estimates of an opportunity cost of capital of 10%. On this basis, the NPV is&#13;
US$2.2 million and the ERR is 43% (Table Al 1.9, Col. 1).&#13;
4  i.e. 572,000 tons (=cargo throughput forecast for 2000) x (670-460)/670 = 179,000 tons.&#13;

Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
42.   The level of traffic would significantly affect the economic return on the&#13;
investment in Can Tho Port. Under the base case, the proposed investments, combined&#13;
with a pro-active port management, will turn the port into an attractive alternative to the&#13;
ports in HCMC. However, it cannot be entirely excluded that shippers and ship owners&#13;
continue to prefer HCMC ports, despite higher transport costs and improved service&#13;
quality. The low traffic scenario assumes that annual throughput would stagnate at&#13;
present levels (as it has in the past). Moreover, if the proposals for one or two new ports&#13;
in the immediate vicinity of Can Tho Port are realized, an even lower throughput than the&#13;
one projected in the low scenario is likely. Should the low traffic case materialize the&#13;
investment in Can Tho Port would not be economically viable, since all cargo could be&#13;
handled by ships' gear, without an increase in waiting times. On the other hand, the&#13;
unavailability of a shore-based crane would affect the service quality and thus further&#13;
reduce the port's attractiveness in comparison with the current state.&#13;
43.   By contrast, under the high traffic scenario, the port's capacity would be&#13;
inadequate, even with the proposed investments.&#13;
44.   The forthcoming three to four years will be crucial in determining which of the&#13;
above traffic scenarios would materialize. Therefore, it would be prudent to restrict any&#13;
cause for further reduction in service quality of the port. On the other hand, to minimize&#13;
the risk of mis-investment, the proposed capital expenditure has been kept to the minimum&#13;
level deemed necessary to maintain an attractive service standard. Additional investment&#13;
should be postponed until there are signs of increases in the port's throughput.&#13;
45.   The critical level of throughput in 2000 is about 510,000 tons per year (18% less&#13;
than the base scenario). At that level, the economic return on the investment would be&#13;
11% and the NPV US$5 1,000 (Table Al1.9, Col. 4).&#13;
46.   Due to the low investment proposed for the port component, the impact on the&#13;
economic return of the project as a whole is low. For instance, if port throughput equals&#13;
the base case, the project NPV increases by about US$2.0 million and the TRR by only 0.3&#13;
percentage points. By contrast, if the worst case scenario of zero benefits for the Can Tho&#13;
Port investments materializes, the project NPV would only be reduced by about US$1.0&#13;
million and the IRR by about 0.8 percentage points (see Project File).&#13;

            Vietnam - Inland Waterways and Port
            Rehabilitation Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The general objective of the Inland
            Waterways and Port Rehabilitation Project is to enhance the
            capacity, efficiency, and safety of inland waterway
            transport in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. To achieve this
            objective, the project comprises three components: 1)
            waterway improvements, specifically, improving the two main
            inland waterway routes by: widening and deepening the routes
            through excavation and dredging; replacing and or improving
            bridges; treating canal side slopes where needed with proper
            surfacing materials to afford stability and prevent erosion;
            rehabilitating existing and installing new navigation aids;
            constructing a landing stage and relocating markets located
            on the waterways; constructing a navigation lock with a
            pedestrian overpass to both limit salinity intrusion and
            permit the passage of barge convoys; and using dredging will
            require people to be resettled and/or compensated according
            to a resettlement plan; 2) Can Tho Port improvement,
            consisting of replacing the existing fenders with an
            improved system along the berth, and collecting vessel bilge
            water and chemical spills; providing cargo handling
            equipment; and providing consultant services and staff
            training in marketing, financial management, business
            development, and port management;  and 3) institution
            building by providing vessels, vehicles, and communications
            equipment for waterway operations and maintenance, as well
            as engaging specialists to help develop staff skills and
            consultants to assist in project implementation and management.
