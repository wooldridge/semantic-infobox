                                      I. BACKGROUND&#13;
&#13;
 1.     Senegal i s located on the West Coast of Afnca and is part of the West African Economic&#13;
 and Monetary Union (WAEMU). With a population estimated at about 10 million, its economy&#13;
 is dominated by a few strategic sectors, including groundnut, fisheries, and services. The&#13;
 informal sector accounts for about 60 percent o f its economy. Its rural economy frequently&#13;
 suffers from drought and lacks access to basic services and infrastructure, leading to low&#13;
productivity, highemigration and higher poverty rates inrural areas. About halfo fthe population&#13;
lives incities, including 30 percent inDakar.&#13;
&#13;
2.      Over the past years, Senegal has enjoyed a stable political climate, and has remained&#13;
largely unaffected byregional instability. A peace agreement was signed inthe Casamance at the&#13;
end o f 2004, generating donor support for the construction effort, including the World Bank. In&#13;
April 2000, Mr. Abdoulaye Wade, third President o f the Republic o f Senegal, and the new&#13;
Government assumed office, representing the first transition to another political party since&#13;
independence.     A new Constitution, approved in January 2001, reduced the length o f the&#13;
presidential term from seven to five years and the unlimited number o f terms to two. Legislative&#13;
elections were concluded on April 2001, and municipal elections inM a y 2002 saw a majority o f&#13;
seats won by the President's Party (Senegalese Democratic Party).&#13;
&#13;
3.      The next two years will see an increase in political activities since legislative and&#13;
presidential elections are scheduled to take place in 2006 and 2007, respectively. This political&#13;
cycle may influence the pace of economic reforms and fiscal policy. Such risks became apparent&#13;
with some governmental spending irregularities in2003 (which came to light in June 2004), and&#13;
could appear again over the coming months in spite o f the recent remedial actions taken by the&#13;
authorities.&#13;
&#13;
4.      Over the past few years, Senegal's macroeconomic performance has been encouraging&#13;
with GDP growth averaging over 5 percent and the absence o f major disequilibrium in its fiscal&#13;
and extemal balances. Sustained and relatively rapid economic growth has reduced the level of&#13;
absolute poverty, from 65 percent in 1994 to 57 percent in 2001, a significant achievement by&#13;
both historical and regional standards. However, Senegal remains a poor country with a GNIper&#13;
capita o f US$690 in2004, and also remains a dual economy, with two thirds o f the poor living in&#13;
rural areas.&#13;
&#13;
5.      While the picture o f a stable, low inflation, growing economy, poised to substantially&#13;
reduce poverty i s accurate, there are constraints that the Government will needto address inorder&#13;
to increase economic performance in line with its new Accelerated Growth Strategy (AGS).&#13;
Since 1994, GDP growth seems to have been driven mostly by internal demand, recovering from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
stagnation preceding the devaluation, rather than being based on external competitiveness&#13;
stemming from growth in productivity, a more favorable exchange rate and an improved&#13;
investment climate. Analysis conducted for the Country Economic Memorandum for Senegal&#13;
issued in2003 shows that despite strong GDP growth, the response o f exports to the devaluation&#13;
has been lackluster, sustainability o f commodity exports such as fish and groundnuts is fragile,&#13;
and the long-term trend in manufacturing productivity (both labor and total factor productivity)&#13;
has been one o f stagnation and even decline. Inaddition, the formal sector provides no new net&#13;
employment opportunities. About 200,000 new job seekers enter the labor market each year and&#13;
many end up underemployed or engaged in subsistence jobs. The recently completed Investment&#13;
Climate Survey highlights a number o f institutional and transversal constraints that need to be&#13;
removed before private investment will take off.&#13;
&#13;
6.      Senegal thus faces a series o f developmental challenges to sustain economic growth and&#13;
achieve poverty alleviation. The Government and other Senegalese stakeholders have recognized&#13;
these challenges, which are addressed in the Government's medium-term poverty reduction&#13;
strategy and the work now being done to develop the AGS. The Government has given a clear&#13;
leading role to enhancing private sector development in these strategy initiatives. Encouraging&#13;
private activities is a prerequisite to reduce unemployment and under-employment, which remain&#13;
important, especially inremote areas and for young adults inurbanareas.&#13;
&#13;
7.     The Government has started to improve the quality o f the investment climate and&#13;
strengthened structural reforms in strategic sectors. Based on recent studies, surveys and analysis&#13;
[Investment Climate Assessment, Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP),                   Doing&#13;
Business, FIAS survey] several constraints continue to limit the expansion and competitiveness&#13;
o f Senegal's private sector. Over the next few years, the Government needs to pursue its efforts&#13;
and achieve significant improvements in the provision o f infrastructure, the quality of the&#13;
investment climate and the gradual diversification o f production away from traditional resources&#13;
such as vegetable oil.      In terms of the investment climate, key obstacles to private sector&#13;
development include limited access to finance for small- and medium-sized enterprises; the poor&#13;
functioning o f the judiciary; remaining administrative barriers, with access to land being a major&#13;
issue; andthe complex tax regime.&#13;
&#13;
8.     Other significant developmental challenges that have been identified include improving&#13;
the transparency and efficiency o f budgetary and financial procedures o f the State, increasing&#13;
delivery of basic social services in the regions, improving the performance o f health and&#13;
education, and increasing protection o f vulnerable groups.       IDA'SBoard approved the First&#13;
Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC I)in December 2004, which has focused on three&#13;
crosscutting and institutional areas:      (i)fiduciary reforms, by strengthening budgetary and&#13;
financial procedures and procurement; (ii)      decentralization, by securing financial transfers to&#13;
local governments as well as disseminating and implementing the Poverty Reduction Strategy at&#13;
the local level; and (iii)health services. This agenda has subsequently been expanded under the&#13;
planned Second PRSC, to also include wealth creation and social protection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                     11. RECENTECONOMIC PERFORMANCE&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
9.       In2004, real GDP growth reached6.4 percent with inflationbelow 1percent, despite the&#13;
impact of a locust infestation. Although the real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated by&#13;
about 12 percent during November 2000-October 2004, reflectingmainly the appreciation o f the&#13;
euro (to which the CFA franc i s pegged) against the U.S. dollar, it has remained depreciated by&#13;
about 8 percent since 1994, compared to an appreciation o f the REER in almost all other&#13;
countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). On the monetary&#13;
front, the BCEAO lowered its key lendingrates by two percentagepoints in an effort to stimulate&#13;
further credit growth to the private sector, but this measure failed to translate into a decline in&#13;
commercial interest rates because of excess reserves inSenegalesebanks.&#13;
&#13;
 10.    In2004, the fiscal performance continuedto besatisfactory sincethe overall fiscal deficit&#13;
(including grants) remained below the IMF program ceiling o f 2.7 percent o f GDP, and the basic&#13;
fiscal balance was also better than programmed. The over-performance reflected larger-than-&#13;
expected revenue and grants, accumulation o f deposits o f public entities at the treasury, and a&#13;
decline in current expenditures.' These developments offset a sharp increase in capital&#13;
expenditures caused by a faster-than-expected rate o f project implementation, notably inprojects&#13;
fundedby external resources.&#13;
&#13;
 11.    The recent economic growth has been associated with a widening o f the current account&#13;
deficit from 5.9 percent o f GDP in 2002 to 6.2 percent o f GDP in 2004. This deterioration was&#13;
driven by strong domestic demand, mainly from the public sector, and lackluster export&#13;
performance. However, substantial private capital inflows, combined with debt relief, led to an&#13;
increase o f 36 percent in the net international reserves o f the central bank, reaching about 4&#13;
months of imports at the end o f 2004.&#13;
&#13;
12.     Over the past few years, private sector performance has been mixed since the overall&#13;
private investment rate declined from 12.3 percent o f GDP in 2000 to 11.8 percent o f GDP in&#13;
2004. This decline reflects the volatility o f the agricultural sector to extemal shocks and the&#13;
unequal performance o f the industrial and service sectors. A few sectors such as construction (up&#13;
by 12.4 percent in 2002 and 10.5 percent in 2003) and mining have expanded faster than the&#13;
overall economy through accessto new financing (e. g., remittances) and the arrival o f a few new&#13;
foreign investors, but others, such as fisheries and transports, have suffered over the past few&#13;
years. This absence o f dynamism i s partly the result o f lack o f significant progress in the&#13;
investment climate.* The recent Bank's hvestment Climate Assessment concluded that labor&#13;
productivity declined in Senegal over the last two decades, emphasizing the need to reverse this&#13;
trendifSenegal wants to be inapositionto achieve stronger andmore equitable growth.&#13;
&#13;
13.     The macroeconomic objectives for 2005 include real GDP growth o f about 5.5 percent&#13;
and consumer price inflation o f about 2 percent, barring any major supply-side shocks. The&#13;
overall fiscal deficit (including grants) i s expected to increase slightly to about 3 percent o f GDP,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 The latest evolution o f Senegal's public finances is analyzed inthe recent Public Expenditure Review, June 2005.&#13;
&#13;
 The indicators listed inDoing Business have not improved markedly between 2003 and 2004 in Senegal.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
but it should be almost entirely financed by external resources. This increase will be principally&#13;
 explained by the surge in capital expenditures, with a doubling of the allocated public resources&#13;
toward infra~tructure.~     The extemal current account (including official transfers) deficit is&#13;
projected to increase to 7.5 percent o f GDP in 2005, as the result o f the larger than expected&#13;
increase in oil prices and the lack o f impetus in new exports. As discussed in the next section,&#13;
given the favorable macro-economic conditions, low debt levels, absence o f central bank&#13;
financing, and little risk o f crowding out the private sector from the credit market, such a level o f&#13;
fiscal and extemal deficits should be accommodated without undermining macroeconomic&#13;
 stability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              111.   PROGRESSINIMPLEMENTINGTHE REFORMPROGRAM&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 14.     The Private Sector Adjustment Credit (PSAC) is an integralpart o f the Bank Strategy set&#13;
forth inthe Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Senegal presented to the Board on April 17,&#13;
2003. The objective o f the Credit is to support the Government in the implementation o f sub-&#13;
sector reforms aimed at improving the investmentclimate and accelerating private sector growth&#13;
and employment. The PSAC supports the Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy through&#13;
improving the investment climate and implementing key sector reforms by: (i)                restructuring the&#13;
edible oil sector by improving the competitive environment in which it operates, through the&#13;
elimination or reduction o f policy distortions associated with non-tariff barriers and other&#13;
domestic protection mechanisms, and o f public interventions; (ii)          supporting the implementation&#13;
of a private enterprise tax regime that stimulates investments through a level playing field and&#13;
lower taxes, and allocates user fees for private sector purposes for which they are levied; (iii)&#13;
reforming postal services by introducing greater competition in the sector, restructuring the&#13;
postal enterprise so as to enhance its sustainability and to create an autonomous financial&#13;
subsidiary that would provide savings and payment and transfer services; and (iv) bringing&#13;
changes to the pensions system to make it financially sustainable and improve its corporate&#13;
governance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Edible OilSector Reform&#13;
15.      About 30 percent o f the Senegalese population directly or indirectly derives part o f its&#13;
livelihood from the groundnut sector. The overall liberalization efforts pursuedbythe Senegalese&#13;
Government inthe 199Os, and more recently in2001 with the divestiture o f the seeds distribution&#13;
subsidiary o f the monopolistic groundnut processing public enterprise (SONACOS), have&#13;
encouraged some efficiency gains. A major further step was taken with the successful&#13;
privatizationo f SONACOS inFebruary 2005.&#13;
&#13;
16.      A sector reform strategy, outlined in the Government's Edible Oil Sector Policy Letter,&#13;
calls for the following broad actions to be taken: (i)elimination o f trade policy, and other&#13;
regulatory and financial sector distortions; (ii)divestiture o f SONACOS; (iii)              complementary&#13;
sector reforms, involving diversification o f production in groundnut producing areas as well as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 For a discussiononpublic investment spending and its effectiveness,see recentPublic ExpenditureReview, June&#13;
    2005.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
possible downstream measures to meet untapped demand; and (iv) clearance o f accumulated&#13;
liabilities, estimated at under CFAF 10 billion, through a one-time financial restructuring o f the&#13;
sector.&#13;
&#13;
 17.     The PSAC focuses on the elimination o f the most serious trade policy and domestic&#13;
distortions which are seen as key to the effective development and diversification o f the sector.&#13;
The following condition o f effectiveness was substantially met in December 2004, after three&#13;
extensions, when the President signed the law eliminating the taxes that provided protection to&#13;
domestic groundnut producers: "the Borrower has implemented the agreed action plan for the&#13;
edible oil sector reform regarding the elimination or reduction, as the case may be, of the&#13;
economic distortions in the areas of trade, domestic market and Jinancial sector policy, inter&#13;
alia, through the elimination of the TCIand Taxe SpkciJique on edible oils. ''&#13;
&#13;
 18.     The Government first suspended the application of the TCI (Taxe Conjoncturelle&#13;
d'Importation) benefit to the edible oils through administrative action camed out at the level o f&#13;
the Director General o f Customs.      This action was then complemented by the passage, on&#13;
December 14, 2004 o f Law No. 2004-34, which involved the abrogation and replacement o f&#13;
article 360 o f the tax law (Code Ge`ne`ral des Impdts) with a revision that eliminates the&#13;
protective tax imposed on both processed and unprocessed edible oils. This law will go into&#13;
effect on December 31,2005, the closing date o f the PSAC. Signing the law also allowed for the&#13;
PRSC Ito go to the Board in December, after the Country Director indicated that the PRSC&#13;
could not be presented to the Board with PSAC effectiveness outstanding. There are no floating&#13;
tranche conditions related to the edible oil sector reform.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
TaxReform&#13;
19.      The Government decision to proceed with a tax reform initiative arose out o f in-depth&#13;
diagnostic work undertaken in collaboration with FIAS. Investment in Senegal was being&#13;
deterred by excessively hightax rates, hrther complicated by a multitude o f taxes and user fees&#13;
and heavy administrative arrangements. The system was recognized to lack transparency and&#13;
encouragerent-seeking.&#13;
&#13;
20.      The tax reform process commenced in earnest with the prior Trade Reform and&#13;
Competitiveness Credit (Cr. 3419) which assisted in the implementation o f reforms covering&#13;
VAT, tariffs and business taxation. The PSAC extends t h s reform drive hrther with a program&#13;
to reduce top rates and reduce a number o f taxes, such that the Marginal Effective Tax Rate&#13;
(METR) has decreased from 45 percent to 28 percent.           Additionally, the reform package&#13;
harmonizes the vocational training tax (Contribution Forfaitaire h la Charge de 1'Employeur -&#13;
CFCE) treatment o f national and foreign workers and allocates 30 percent o f proceeds to the&#13;
hnding of a matching grant facility beingestablished under the PPPproject (Private Investment&#13;
Promotion Project, Cr. 3762). The reform also includes the rationalization o f investment code&#13;
waivers granted inregardto the consumption tax and import duties to bringthese inline with the&#13;
WAEMU Common External Tariffandthe Value-Added Tax scheme.&#13;
&#13;
21.      This tax reform program has been widely supported by both the Senegalese Government&#13;
and the private sector. The recent June 2005 meeting o f the Presidential Investors' Advisory&#13;
Council that comprises both local and international business members highlighted the progress&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 Senegal has made in reducing the tax burden, both in terms o f the overall level o f taxation and&#13;
 the lack o f transparency that exists in the system. The President also committed, during the&#13;
 course o f the Council deliberations, to further reduce corporate tax to 25 percent. This will&#13;
 further reduce the METRto enterprises inSenegal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Postal ServicesReform&#13;
 22.     The objectives pursuedby the Government are stated in the Letter o f Postal Sector Policy&#13;
 of April 17, 2003 and include: (i)     improve overall performance through a progressive sector&#13;
 liberalization and increased private sector participation; (ii) modernize the legal and regulatory&#13;
 framework and strengthen sector regulation; (iii)   safeguard the right to basic communications for&#13;
 all citizens through a funding mechanism to support the cost o f universal postal services&#13;
 obligations; (iv) transform the historical postal operator into a modem and performing&#13;
 corporation through the definition and implementation o f a new corporate strategy; and&#13;
 (v) promote the sustainable development o f postal financial services inorder to improve access&#13;
 o f the population to basic financial and savings services, and channel these savings towards&#13;
 private investment funds.&#13;
&#13;
 23.     The PSAC supports (i)    ongoing reforms aimed at introducingmore competition inpostal&#13;
 services, strengthening corporate govemance, and restructuring the postal corporation so as to&#13;
 improve its sustainability and its service quality; and (ii)&#13;
                                                            implementation o f the requiredfinancial&#13;
restructuringo f the operator.&#13;
&#13;
24.      After a period o f sustained progress, the postal services reform was slowed considerably&#13;
inlate2004. Efforts arenow beingmadebythe Government to getthe reformback ontrack and&#13;
regain lost momentum. It i s expected that two o f the tranche conditions will be completed over&#13;
the coming months, namely: (i)     the effective transfer ofresponsibility for the regulation ofpostal&#13;
services from SNP (Socie'te' Nationale de La Poste) to ART (Agence de re'gulation des&#13;
te'le'communications); and (ii)  performance-based agreement entered into between the Borrower&#13;
and SNP for the operation o fpostal services.&#13;
&#13;
25.      The creation o f the postal financial subsidiary and the problems arising out o f staff&#13;
indebtedness towards the company remain the most challenging aspects o f the reform program.&#13;
Agreement has been reached, taking into account the conclusions o f the Financial Sector&#13;
Assessment report completed inlate 2004, to limit the initial round o f financial subsidiary reform&#13;
to the creation o f a hlly public independent entity with a view to privatization at a later stage.&#13;
The coming months will show whether the Government is able to complete this and hlfillthe&#13;
conditions for the release o f the postal services reform floating tranche.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Pension Reform&#13;
26.      The Government's pension reform strategy i s described in the sector policy statement&#13;
dated June 6, 2003. The first phase o f reforms involves a series o f parametric reforms and&#13;
changes to the way the Institution de Pre'voyance Retraite du Se'ndgal (PRES) scheme i s&#13;
managed, inparticular with regard to its investment policy and practices. The implementation o f&#13;
these policy changes requires a series o f concrete steps including improvements to the existing&#13;
information system, professional advice regardinginvestment policy, changes inaccounting rules&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 and practices, as well as regular independent audits and training o f Board, members and staff.&#13;
 These, along with other activities required to successfully implement the policy changes, are&#13;
 beingsupported under the pensions sub-component o f the PIPP.&#13;
&#13;
 27.     The secondphase o freform hastwo maincomponents. The first areainvolves redefining&#13;
 pension policy that currently treats civil servants and private sector workers differently. There&#13;
 are clear arguments for the integration o f the two existing formal schemes although this policy&#13;
 may be gradually applied. Integrationwould facilitate labor mobility, improve equity and would&#13;
 likelyreduce overall administrationcosts. The second areainvolvesthe future role ofthe private&#13;
 sector in overall pension provision. As in the case o f integration, the Government believes that&#13;
 systemic reforms must be constructed after the existing schemes are stabilized and credibility is&#13;
 restored.   A systemic reform would require careful preparation, especially with regard to&#13;
 institutional design.&#13;
&#13;
 28.     The PSAC supports an ongoing and multi-phase reform process that would completely&#13;
restructure the existing pension system in Senegal. Specifically, the PSAC supports the shift to&#13;
 automatic indexation o f key parameters o f the pension scheme and an increase inthe retirement&#13;
 age as immediate measures applied to the P R E S scheme. This would be followed by the&#13;
resolution o f outstanding arrears in a way that restores pension rights to a significant group of&#13;
workers and clarifies the status o f the P R E S balance sheet.&#13;
&#13;
29.      Several aspects o f the pension reform are proceeding. A Supervision Commission was&#13;
appointed in November 2004 and commenced full operations in June 2005. This i s a key step in&#13;
addressing the governance and management issues that are central to the reform agenda. The&#13;
Government has also transferred approximately CFCA 8 billion in anears due to PRES who&#13;
have advised that they are now making payments against these funds to pension recipients.&#13;
Several key "tranche condition" studies are launched (selection o f consultant done in July with&#13;
start-up o f work inAugust, 2005) includingon the consolidation o f existing pension schemes and&#13;
on structural reform to introduce private pension funds. The investment policy report, the&#13;
commission is working on a draft document transmitted by the new PRES Director, the report&#13;
will be finalized and validated in October 2005.            These will provide the analysis and&#13;
recommendations critical to the next stage o f the government's institutional reform o f the sector&#13;
and subsequentpolicy decisions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                IV.     PROGRESSAGAINST TRANCHE RELEASE CRITERIA&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
30.     The first tranche was disbursed upon effectiveness. The conditions o f release o f the&#13;
floating tranche listed inPart A o f Schedule 2 o f the Development Credit Agreement betweenthe&#13;
Borrower and IDA related to the Tax Reform Plan state that the following conditions must be&#13;
fulfilled:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In accordance with thefiscal management plan referred to in paragraphs 22, 23 and 24 of the&#13;
Letter of Sector Policy dated April 2003, the Borrower shall havefurnished to the Association&#13;
the evidence, inform and substance satisfactory to theAssociation, of thefollowing:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 1.     reduction in the METRfor the industry to 28percent or less - This conditionhas&#13;
        been met.&#13;
&#13;
Inconformitywith the recommendation ofthe "Etude de l `OpportunitkdeBaisse du Taux&#13;
Effectifd 'Imposition (June 2003), aFiscalMeasure Action Planwas prepared which detailed&#13;
the series o fmeasures that were requiredto reduce the METR.&#13;
&#13;
This was achieved by the adoption o fLaw No. 2004-12 o fFebruary 12,2004 which modified&#13;
therelevant sections o fthe General Tax Code. The WorldBank hasreceived, as part o fthe&#13;
 applicationpackage for this floating tranche release, copies o f the original FiscalMeasure&#13;
Action Plan, plus a copy o f the new Tax Code with a summarytable o f the tax changes&#13;
effected. This has been reviewedby Bank experts who have confirmedthat the METR rate&#13;
has been reduced to less than 28 percent.&#13;
&#13;
2.      elimination of specific exceptional tax regimes, including inconsistencies between the&#13;
        WAEMUCommon External Tariff and the VAT, but excluding exceptional tax&#13;
        regimesfor certain exporters, the extractive industry sector and the tourism sector, as&#13;
        agreed with the Association - This conditionhasbeenmet.&#13;
&#13;
The elimination o f the specific, exceptional tax regimeswas achieved with the adoption o f&#13;
the new InvestmentCode (Law 2004-06, February 6,2004), together with the new Mining&#13;
Code (Law 2003-36, November 26,2003). The streamlining o f consumptiontax and import&#13;
dutywaivers inthe Investment Code has achieved the desired consistency betweenthe&#13;
Investment Code and the WAEMU CommonExternal Tariff and V A T codes. Also o f&#13;
particular note within the MiningCode i s the elimination o f any discretionary waiving o f the&#13;
annual mineral tax (see article 57).&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank has received, as part o f the applicationpackage for this floating tranche&#13;
release, copies o f the new Miningand InvestmentCodes.&#13;
&#13;
3.      harmonization of the rate of the CFCE to 3percent and utilization of at least one-&#13;
        third of revenues collected in respect thereof tofund a matching grantfacility - This&#13;
        condition hasbeensubstantiallymet.&#13;
&#13;
UnderLaw 2004-34, adopted onDecember 14,2004, the differential vocational training tax&#13;
CFCE rate (3 percent for national employees and 6 percent for foreign employees) was&#13;
harmonizedto 3 percent. This was achieved by abrogating the existing article 198 o f the&#13;
General Tax Code. Additionally the Government, inits letter o f April 27, 2005, has&#13;
committed to allocate one third o f the value o f the CFCE revenues to the matching grant&#13;
scheme beingdeveloped under the associatedPIPPproject.&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank has received, as part o f the application for this floating tranche release,&#13;
relevant correspondence confirming actions taken under Law No. 2004-34 and a letter from&#13;
the Minister o f Budget confirming commitments and actions to be taken in fulfillment o f the&#13;
allocation to the matching grant scheme. The Government has further confirmed that&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    changes are beingmade to the draft Budget Law for FY06 to give effect to this allocation of&#13;
    CFCE user charges. This proposed draft budget law will have beenprepared and available by&#13;
    November 2005. Based on these assurances, the Bank i s satisfied that at least one third o f the&#13;
    revenues collected from the CFCE will be utilized to fund the matching grant facility.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
31.    The Borrower has therefore met the three conditions for the release o f the Tax Reform&#13;
Plan floating tranche as specified inPart A o f Schedule 2 o fthe Development Credit Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         V.     CONCLUSION&#13;
32.    In view of the overall performance and progress with the implementation of the Tax&#13;
Reform Plan supported by the Credit, and incompliance with the specific conditions o f release as&#13;
described in paragraphs 1-3 o f Section IV above, the Association has informed the Borrower o f&#13;

            Senegal - Private Sector Adjustment Credit
            Project : release of the first floating tranche - full compliance
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Private Sector Adjustment Credit
            (PSAC) is an integral part of the Bank Strategy, set forth
            in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Senegal (2003).
            The objective of the Project is to support the Government in
            the implementation of sub-sector reforms aimed at improving
            the investment climate, and accelerating private sector
            growth, and employment. The PSAC supports the
            Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy through
            improvements within the investment climate, and
            implementation of key sector reforms. The first tranche was
            disbursed upon effectiveness. The conditions of release of
            the floating tranche as listed in the Development Credit
            Agreement between the Borrower and the International
            Development Association (IDA) related to the Tax Reform
            Plan, state the conditions that need to be fulfilled.
            Therefore, in view of the overall performance and progress
            with the implementation of the Tax Reform Plan supported by
            the Credit, and in compliance with the specific conditions
            of release, the Association has informed the Borrower of the
            availability of the tax reform floating tranche, in the
            amount of SDR 4.7 million.
