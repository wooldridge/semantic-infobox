   BOX 1: IS YOUR TOILET SPILLING OVER?&#13;
&#13;
   When a program designed to help one person also helps other people, economists refer to this as the â&#128;&#156;spillover ef-&#13;
   fect.â&#128;? Open defecation hurts anyone living nearby who comes into contact with fecal germs. Therefore, latrine use&#13;
   would have positive spillovers: one personâ&#128;&#153;s safe feces disposal can make anotherâ&#128;&#153;s children healthier. Such spillovers&#13;
   are a central reason for government action in economic theory as left on their own, people may not sufficiently con-&#13;
   sider the effects of their behavior on others.&#13;
&#13;
   One statistical consequence of these positive spillovers is that merely comparing neighboring families who do and do&#13;
   not have latrines will not fully reveal the benefits of sanitation for children. Children in both families will be hurt by the&#13;
   household that openly defecates and helped by the household that does not. To document the full effect of sanitation,&#13;
   researchers must study the consequences of community-level sanitation, which is why the Maharashtra experiment&#13;
   was randomly allocated to villages, not to households.&#13;
&#13;
   It is sometimes claimed that sanitation spillovers suggest that reducing open defecation will not make anyone health-&#13;
   ier until the practice is completely eliminated. However, this does not necessarily follow, in much the same way that&#13;
   claiming that reducing air pollution, a classic example of a negative spillover, does no good unless pollution is wholly&#13;
   eradicated.&#13;
&#13;
   The exact extent of sanitation spillovers depends on the context and situation. For example, open defecation is worse&#13;
   for neighbors in places where population density is greater and people live closer together. In Ahmednagar district,&#13;
   even relatively modest community-level sanitation improvements had a positive effect. We know that spillovers played&#13;
   an important role in this area because even in households that did not have a latrine in â&#128;&#156;endlineâ&#128;? data after the pro-&#13;
   gram, children were taller after the program than before. In fact, the effect of the program on child height is statistically&#13;
   indistinguishable for households that had latrines and households that did not.&#13;

&#13;
    BOX 2: WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM ONE DISTRICT?&#13;
&#13;
    The Maharashtra experiment was originally intended to be conducted in three districts, but ultimately was imple-&#13;
    mented in only one. How does this change what we can learn from this experiment? How does it change how we&#13;
    should think about policy experiments in general? Many randomized experiments in development are implemented by&#13;
    high-quality NGOs; does it matter that this one was overseen by a government instead?&#13;
&#13;
    The purpose of randomization in an experiment is to ensure that, on average, treatment and control groups are com-&#13;
    parable so the difference noted can be interpreted as a causal effect. Within Ahmednagar district, the TSC experiment&#13;
    was, indeed, a randomized experiment and can be used to estimate the effect of the program. However, there is no&#13;
    guarantee that the effect found in Ahmednagar district would have been the same as if there had been an experiment&#13;
    in Nandurbar, a much poorer district. The District Magistrate of a district that differs from Ahmednagar might be justi-&#13;
    fied in wondering whether this experimentâ&#128;&#153;s results would be exactly replicated in her district.&#13;
&#13;
    What is true of this experiment is true of essentially every study or evaluation: some conclusions can be generalized&#13;
    while others are limited to the context studied. The Maharashtra experiment is special only because we happen to&#13;
    know that the government initially planned to experiment elsewhere and because we have data on all three districts,&#13;
    even though only one hosted an experiment. However, almost every study could have been conducted somewhere&#13;
    other than it was; too often, this decision is not analyzed. This means that it is difficult to know how the selection of&#13;
    partner organizations and research sites shapes the overall body of knowledge about what works.&#13;
&#13;
    Ultimately, a more complete picture requires comparisons of multiple studies and methods. Using non-experimental&#13;
    statistical methods, economist Dean Spears has estimated an average effect of the TSC on all of rural India, includ-&#13;
    ing places where the TSC was much less active than in Ahmednagar. He finds that the TSC had an average effect on&#13;
    height about half as large as the effect this experiment had in Ahmednagar. This makes sense: the program in Ahmed-&#13;
    nagar was a careful experiment, conducted in a district that was particularly disposed to implementation of the TSC.&#13;
    This difference in estimated impacts highlights the importance of the context from which evidence about a programâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
    effectiveness is taken.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
    BOX 3: WHY CARE ABOUT HEIGHT? THE LONG AND THE SHORT OF AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR&#13;
&#13;
    Compared with healthy children around the world, Indian children are much too short. The difference is not due to&#13;
    Indian genetics: other studies show that healthy children in South Delhi grow as tall as children in rich countries, and&#13;
    that Indian children who move to Europe early in their lives substantially catch up with the growth of other children.&#13;
    Identifying the many factors that combine to make Indian children so short is an important puzzle open to further&#13;
    research.&#13;
&#13;
    Does height matter? For a population, it very much does. The difference in height between any two people has a large&#13;
    genetic component. In contrast, widespread stunting in India suggests that early-life disease and malnutrition keep&#13;
    many people from growing to the height potential that their genetics would allow.&#13;
&#13;
    This is problematic because the same health deficits that slow physical growth have other lasting and harmful con-&#13;
    sequences. On average, studies from around the world suggest that shorter children become shorter adults who&#13;
    earn less money, achieve less of their cognitive potential, suffer worse health, and may even die sooner. Height does&#13;
    not directly cause these problems; it is an indicator of early-life conditions that cause them. This means that stunting&#13;
    among Indian children is not merely a health issue, it is also an economic issue and that sanitation is as well.&#13;

            Coming up short without sanitation : a
            community sanitation program by the Indian government helped
            children grow taller and healthier in the State of Maharashtra
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Most people living in rural Indian
            villages defecate openly outside, without using a toilet or
            latrine. In 2004, as a supplement to its ongoing Total
            Sanitation Campaign (TSC), the government of Maharashtra
            conducted a randomized, controlled experiment to study the
            effect of a sanitation intervention. In Ahmednagar district
            of Maharashtra, 30 villages were randomly assigned to a
            community-level sanitation motivation treatment group and 30
            villages to a control group. The program caused a modest
            increase in sanitation coverage. After the experimental
            intervention, villages in the treatment group achieved more
            latrine use than villages in the control group, but open
            defecation remained a practice in almost every village.
            These results suggest that even incremental improvements in
            sanitation can lead to better health for children. From 1999
            to 2012, the Indian government's flagship program to
            end rural open defecation was called the TSC. The TSC was
            implemented after the centrally sponsored rural sanitation
            programmed of the 1990s, which invested in latrine
            construction, but did not specifically promote latrine use.
            In 2004, the Indian state of Maharashtra began the large
            scale implementation of the TSC. As the TSC was new at the
            time, there was an opportunity to learn from the
            implementation experience given that it would be launched in
            some districts and villages before others. Analysis of this
            experiment demonstrates that improving sanitation in these
            villages in Ahmednagar district allowed children to grow
            taller. However, one of the most important conclusions of
            this study required neither statistical analysis nor a
            randomized, controlled trial-in two of the three districts
            where the state government originally decided to
            experimentally implement the TSC, no action was taken,
            illustrating the constraints facing the Indian government,
            the importance of investing in the capacity of district
            governments, and the need to ensure that local governments
            are motivated to carry out programs that can reduce open defecation.
