Growth shocks appear to have a larger negative                                        Southern Europe. Yet, Southern Europe showed the most&#13;
longer term impact on employment in Southern                                          persistent increase in unemployment. In fact, after 5 years&#13;
Europe. Estimates show that the initial response to a                                 (20 quarters), the cumulative effect of a given negative&#13;
one-percent negative real GDP growth shock is on average                              GDP growth shock was 50 percent higher in Southern than&#13;
the highest in Western Europe and, initially, the smallest in                         in Western Europe.1/&#13;

  	Estimates are based on a panel VAR with country fixed effects and quarterly data from Q1 1999 to Q2 2015 using the â&#128;&#152;Helmert procedureâ&#128;&#153; (Arellano and Bover, 1995).&#13;
    This procedure removes only the forward mean, i.e. the mean of all the future observations available for each country-quarter, and preserves the orthogonality&#13;
    between transformed variables and lagged regressors. Lagged regressors are used as instruments and coefficients estimated by system GMM. This methodology&#13;
    deals successfully with the Hurwicz-type bias associated to the use of fixed effects in a dynamic panel framework.&#13;

   	According to the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Doing Business (2015) Southern European countries improved their regulations and administration for enforcing contracts, minority investor&#13;
    protection, paying taxes and getting electricity. Regulations on insolvency and taxes were significant areas of improvement in the Central Europe. In contrast, Northern Euro-&#13;
    pean countries made it easier to start a business by simplifying pre-registration and registration formalities (Estonia, Sweden) or introducing more online procedures (Den-&#13;
    mark, Lithuania). Similar to the Southern Europe, but to a lesser extent, the Western Europe made broad-based improvements, notably in starting a business, protecting mi-&#13;
    nority investors and paying taxes.&#13;

  	Singapore and New Zealand remained at the top of the ranking, and the US remained seventh. The top-ranked EU member states in 2015 were Denmark (third), United King-&#13;

     	Social assistance programs are typically not designed to fully lift families out of poverty â&#128;&#147; their purpose is to mitigate poverty and connect people to opportunities that can lift&#13;
      them out of poverty. A transfer given to an extremely poor family will enhance their welfare, and reduce the poverty gap. Transfers given to families closer to the poverty line are&#13;
      more likely to have an impact in terms of fully lifting them out of poverty and therefore reducing the poverty headcount.&#13;

       	The real spending is measured in constant 2005 Euros. Exchange rate changes during this time explain a significant part of the changes in spending in EU member states&#13;
         with flexible exchange rates, in particular in Romania.&#13;

         often difficult to cut during a period of recession or slow economic growth.&#13;

European member states are some of the biggest                    models: namely large balanced welfare states, truncated&#13;
spenders on social protection in the world, but                   welfare states, small balanced welfare states, and limited&#13;
some are unable to provide effective protection for               welfare states. These models differ along the size of social&#13;

            The European Union (EU) Regular Economic
            Report (RER), is a semiannual publication of the World Bank
            Group and covers economic developments, prospects, and
            economic policies in the European Union. The report uses
            four sub-groups that share broadly similar development
            patterns EU : Central Europe comprises Bulgaria, Croatia,
            Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovak Republic
            and Slovenia; Northern Europe comprises Denmark, Estonia,
            Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden; Southern Europe
            comprises Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain; Western
            Europe comprises Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland,
            Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. While
            the report covers the European Union, it provides additional
            information on European countries which had historically a
            stronger operational engagement with the World Bank Group,
            in particular, Bulgaria, Croatia, Poland and Romania. The
            focus note of this RER covers “Welfare States and the
            Protection of the Poor in the European Union”.
