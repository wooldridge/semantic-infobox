                    Releaseofthe SecondTranche-FullCompliance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   I.INTRODUCTION&#13;
&#13;
 1.      The Financial Management Adjustment Credit (FMAC), approved inJune 2002,&#13;
provided financial assistance to support the implementation of reforms in the areas of&#13;
public sector reform, state-owned enterprises reform, andfinancial sector reform i.e. the&#13;
Program, as articulated inthe Government's Letter of Development Policy (LDP) and the&#13;
Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP).         The Credit was for an amount of&#13;
SDR 13.5 million (US$ 17 million equivalent) to be disbursedintwo tranches, with the&#13;
first tranche of SDR5.6 million (US$7 millionequivalent) disbursed inJanuary 2003.&#13;
&#13;
2.       The objective of the Program was to increase transparency and accountability in&#13;
budgetary management and in the management of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and&#13;
state-owned commercial banks (SCBs), to stem the accumulation of contingent liabilities&#13;
in SOEs and SCBs and move them towards commercial viability, and to strengthen&#13;
management of public expenditures inparticular, and public sector resources in general.&#13;
Given the need for sustained reforms, the LDP laid out the Government's commitment&#13;
for continuing reforms inthese areas and this was reaffirmed by the National Growth and&#13;
Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES) that was recently endorsed by the National&#13;
Assembly.&#13;
&#13;
3.       The Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) has made satisfactory progress in&#13;
maintaining an appropriate macroeconomic policy framework (see Section 11) and in&#13;
carrying out the Program laid out in the LDP, including the completion of seventeen&#13;
specific actions, cited inschedule 2 of the DCA, for the release of the secondtranche.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              11.     MACROECONOMICPOLICY FRAMEWORK&#13;
&#13;
4.      Lao PDR has made satisfactory progress in reducing inflation as well as in&#13;
sustaining economic growth and poverty reduction. Real GDP growth rate has been&#13;
robust, and inflation, after rising in the first half of 2003 has slowed significantly. The&#13;
IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) completed three reviews&#13;
successfully. The fourth review was delayed due to revenue shortfalls inthe first quarter&#13;
of 2003/04, but recent data shows that the revenue target for the first six months (Le. by&#13;
end-March 2004) was met. The IMF's `PRGF and Article IV mission is now planned for&#13;
June, with presentationto the Board expected inAugust 2004.&#13;
&#13;
5.      Inflation as of April 2004, fell to 11.9 percent on a year-on-year basis, not as low&#13;
as was originally expected; non-food inflation is down to single digits. Average annual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 inflation during the three-year period o f 2001-03 has also come down significantly,&#13;
 relative to the previous three-year period.&#13;
&#13;
 6.      Real GDP grew by 5.7 and 5.5 percent in 2002 and 2003 respectively and as a&#13;
 result, poverty has come down from 39 percent in 1997/98 to 30 percent, as estimated by&#13;
 the 2002/03 household survey. Virtually all o f this reduction has taken place inthe rural&#13;
 areas where most o f the poor live. This economic growth was made possible in part by&#13;
 higher foreign direct investment inflows, good export growth and strong agricultural,&#13;
 performance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        111.    SPECIFICACTIONSFOR SECOND TRANCHE RELEASE&#13;
&#13;
 7.      The progress in carrying out the overall Program, including the specific actions&#13;
 listed in schedule 2 and referred to in section 2.02 (d) o f the DCA, has been satisfactory.&#13;
Technical assistance through the World Bank's parallel Financial Management Capacity&#13;
Building Credit (FMCBC) and quarterly monitoring at a high level within Government&#13;
made this possible. The implementation o f the program took longer than was originally&#13;
envisaged, due in large measure to capacity-limitations in the public service, but all&#13;
specific actions have beencompleted. Each o f the actions inthe D C A are cited below in&#13;
italics, andthis i s followed by the status o f implementation.&#13;
&#13;
Public Sector Reform&#13;
&#13;
8.       Completed through the Committee on Planning and Cooperation (CPC), an&#13;
assessment, in a manner and substance satisfactory to the Association, of recurrent&#13;
cost estimatesassociatedwith newprojects in excess of 1billion kip.&#13;
&#13;
9.       This action has been completed. CPC carried out the assessment of recurrent&#13;
cost estimates associated with new projects in the 2002/03 Public Investment Program&#13;
(PIP) that were in excess o f 1 billion kip. Recurrent costs were estimated for 149 new&#13;
projects inthe PIP that were in excess o f 1 billion kip. This was done by developing an&#13;
agreed methodology, preparing a training manual and doing training o f CPC and sector&#13;
staff, and then asking the trained staff to make these estimates. Further disseminationo f&#13;
this methodology and training is plannedto ensure that agency level cost centers can do&#13;
this estimation ona regularbasis duringthe PIP andbudgetingprocesses.&#13;
&#13;
10.      Prepared, through the Ministry of Finance, in a manner and substance&#13;
satisfactory to the Association, a strategy for the reform of the Department of the&#13;
Treasury.&#13;
&#13;
11.      This action has been completed. The Department of Treasury prepared a&#13;
strategy and an agenda for its reform program, which cover the key problems to be&#13;
addressed together with either the necessary actions for addressing them or the necessary&#13;
steps needed to develop those actions.            It builds on the Government's earlier&#13;
Memorandumto the IMF outlining an initial set o f measures, as well as measures cited in&#13;
the NGPES.        The following ten areas are covered by the strategy: the legislative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 framework; the organizational structure o f central treasury; the management o f sub-&#13;
 treasury operations; the payments &amp; bankingprocedures; the revenue collection system;&#13;
 cash management; debt management; the accounting system; the financial reporting and&#13;
 the information and communication technology (ICT) requirements. The Government&#13;
 expects to adopt this strategy and beginimplementation in2004, and for this purpose has&#13;
 requested technical assistance. This request comprises o f an external treasury advisor&#13;
 funded by the IMF, as well as a national consultant funded by the FMCB credit, both&#13;
 expected to support the treasury in implementing the strategy as expeditiously as&#13;
 possible.&#13;
&#13;
 12.     In addition, the accounting department has revisedthe chart of accounts and the&#13;
budget nomenclature as reflected in decision No. 811/MOF, dated April 29, 2004 and&#13;
reduced drastically the number of line items. The Department has initiated training o f its&#13;
 staff with the objective o f implementing the new chart o f accounts for the formulation o f&#13;
the 2004/05 budget.&#13;
&#13;
 13.     Established a Procurement Monitoring Office within the Ministry of Finance,&#13;
headed by a qualified and experienced Director and assigned with adequate staff and&#13;
resourcesin a manner and substancesatisfactory to theAssociation.&#13;
&#13;
 14.     This action has been completed. The new Procurement Monitoring Office has&#13;
been established and the procurement rules and regulations have been strengthened. The&#13;
office i s headed by a qualified and experienced director and it has acquired the necessary&#13;
staff and office facilities.     The Government adopted more than a dozen o f the&#13;
recommendations o f the recent Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR)&#13;
through the revised Procurement Sub-Decree issued inDecember 2003, andthe amended&#13;
Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRRs) issued in March 2004.               This includes&#13;
revisions in areas beyond the eight that were agreed during negotiations: thresholds o f&#13;
procurement methods, thresholds o f approval procedures, conditions for direct&#13;
negotiations, advertising o f opportunities, outlawing o f gratuities &amp; inducements,&#13;
reestablishing o f bidders' qualifications, dispute resolution, and the authority for signing&#13;
contracts. In addition major improvements in the clarity and specificity o f language has&#13;
also beenimplemented inthe revisedprocurement rules.&#13;
&#13;
15.     Issued, through the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF),in a manner&#13;
and substancesatisfactory to theAssociation,Regulations amending theImplementing&#13;
Regulations on National Biodiversity Conservation Areas (IVBCAs), regulation no.&#13;
0524/AF.2001 (June 7, 2001), inter alia, to clarify the definitions and procedures&#13;
governing zoning and land use within said Conservation Areas, and eliminate&#13;
inconsistenciesin respect of protected species listings.&#13;
&#13;
16.     This action has been completed. The new Regulation 380 issued by MAF in&#13;
December 2003 (amending Regulation 524 of June 2001) has clarified land use and&#13;
removed inconsistencies inthe protected species classifications, bringingLao PDR closer&#13;
to the International Union for the Protection o f Nature (IUCN) guidelines. For example,&#13;
NBCAs have been more finely categorized into four types, rather than the two that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 existed before. Similarly there have been simplification and clarification on wildlife&#13;
 management, clearly distinguishing between strictly protected species and those that are&#13;
 for managed use, forbidding possession o f protectedrestricted species except for clearly&#13;
 defined purposes;    providing clear mandates with respect to transport, hunting and&#13;
 captive breedingo f wildlife; and banningthe use of dangerous huntingmethods. Further&#13;
 improvements inframework and inenforcement will continue to be implemented.&#13;
&#13;
 17.     Adopted, through the Ministry of          Agriculture and Forestry (MAF),&#13;
 Implementing Regulations on Sustainable Forestry Management, satisfactory to the&#13;
 Association, which includes specijic provisions to enable the involvement of local&#13;
 communitiesinproductionforest management.&#13;
&#13;
 18.     This action has been completed. The new Implementing Regulations were&#13;
 issued by MAF in October 2003 with provisions supporting many important elements o f&#13;
 a participatory approach to production forest management, including provisions for&#13;
 substantial benefit sharing with local communities, market-orientation in timber sales,&#13;
 adherence to forest management plan, harvest prescriptions and utilization o f revenues,&#13;
 to support local level forest management technical units. It i s thus expected to promote&#13;
 the involvement o f local communities inproduction forest management. and Government&#13;
 i s well advanced toward the formal declaration o f the first eight National Production&#13;
 Forest Areas under the Regulation, laying the basis for disciplined and accountable&#13;
 management on at least 500,000 hectares o f forest land.&#13;
&#13;
 SOEReform&#13;
&#13;
 19.     Issued, through MOF, Implementing Regulations to the Decree on&#13;
Management of State-Invested Enterprises, Decree No. 5 4 P M dated May 9, 2002&#13;
satisfactory to theAssociation.&#13;
&#13;
 20.     This Action has been completed.           The Government issued satisfactory&#13;
 Implementing Regulations for Decree 54 in December 2002 which, inter alia provided&#13;
 details on financial reporting requirements for the SOEs.          These regulations are&#13;
prerequisites to collecting and evaluating the financial and operational data on SOE&#13;
performance, and once collected such data can be used for classification o f all SOEs on&#13;
the basis o f agreed performance criteria. Technical assistance was provided under the&#13;
Bank's FMCB Credit, to the officials inthe central andprovincial state assetmanagement&#13;
bureaus o f MOF and the directors o f all SOEs, so that they understand not only the&#13;
requirements and the implications o f these Regulations for their reporting but also the&#13;
need to record information on performance properly.&#13;
&#13;
21.     Prepared and furnished to the Association in a manner and substance&#13;
satisfactory to the Association, through the Ministry of Finance, an assessment of the&#13;
financial performance of SOEs and, under criteria consistent with technical audit&#13;
standards satisfactory to the Association, identified non-performing SOEs requiring:&#13;
(i) performance improvement; (igstrengtheningof financial reporting; or (iii) bringing&#13;
them to thepoint of sale or liquidation, as the case may be.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22.     This Action has been completed. The Ministry of Finance, through their letter&#13;
number267, dated 8 January 2004, identified nearly a quarter ofthe number of SOEs (24&#13;
provincial, and 7 central SOEs), as making large losses and thus requiring sale or&#13;
liquidation.    This was based on a classification using an assessment of financial&#13;
performance o f SOEs. The set o f agreedtechnical criteria to assess performance, covered&#13;
profitability, solvency, liquidity, debt management and operational activity as well as&#13;
management capacity, industry experience and viability o f business plan. All 140 SOEs&#13;
were classifiedusingthis criteriaandthe proposed actions as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        0   o f 43 centrally managed SOEs, 7 were performing well and had good&#13;
            financial reporting, 4 neededperformance improvements, and 25 needed both&#13;
            performance improvements and strengthening o f financial reporting.&#13;
&#13;
            o f 97 provincially managed SOEs classified, 7 were performing well and had&#13;
            good financial reporting, 2 required only strengtheningo f financial reporting,&#13;
            and 64 needed both performance improvements and strengthening financial&#13;
            reporting.&#13;
&#13;
23.     Adopted a time-bound restructuringplan, satisfactory to the Association, for&#13;
BPKP, Nam Papa Lao, Pharmaceutical Factory No. 3, and Lao Aviation, and&#13;
implemented all of the actions under the said restructuringplan, which in accordance&#13;
with such time-bound restructuringplan are due within seven (7) calendar daysprior&#13;
to the exchange of views under Section 2.02 (4 of theDCA.&#13;
&#13;
24.     This Action has been completed. Time-bound restructuring plans have been&#13;
adopted for each o f the above mentioned four SOEs and an initial set o f actions&#13;
consistent with the restructuring plan have been implemented. The initial set o f actions&#13;
include changes in management, reduction in labor force, reductions in number o f non-&#13;
core activities, re-organization to improve control and so on.        The adoption o f the&#13;
restructuring plans i s evident in the Prime Minister's (PM's) Notice No. 059KPMO&#13;
dated 15 January 2004 and inthe accompanying Implementing Guidelines for each o f the&#13;
four SOEs issued to relevant agencies on April 29 2004 by the Minister in the Prime&#13;
Minister's office in charge o f SOE restructuring. The PM's Notice highlights the key&#13;
elements o f the plans and the broad scope o f restructuring that i s directed to be carried&#13;
out, while the Implementing Guidelines provide details on the processes, restructuring&#13;
actions and the monitoring requirements, including a clear timeline for actions in 2004&#13;
andin2005.&#13;
&#13;
25.     Lao Aviation.      Following changes in management and some financial&#13;
restructuring, the Government conducted an in-depth analysis o f the financial and&#13;
operational situation, including tariffs, to develop restructuring options. These options&#13;
were subjected to extensive stakeholder consultations, after which the Government&#13;
decided to convert Lao Aviation into a joint-venture entity with a strategic foreign&#13;
partner, with Lao nationals owning 51 percent, but Government becoming a minority&#13;
shareholder. This will be done by issuing new shares and diluting the Government's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
holdings. In addition, the adopted plan also sets out the processes, the need o f an&#13;
external advisor to assist the Government inthis transaction, and the decision to use cost-&#13;
recovery or commercial tariffs except on routes that maybe subsidized by the&#13;
Government for social reasons.&#13;
&#13;
26.     Bolisat Phattana Khet Phoudoi (BPKP). Several measures like reducing the&#13;
number of activities from 58 to 9, lowering the size of the labour force and changing&#13;
management were implemented during this period. The adopted restructuring plan&#13;
envisages continuation o f two core activities - wood and wood processing, as well as&#13;
construction- while hiving off the non-core activities from BPKP. Most o f the non-core&#13;
activities are proposed for sale or liquidation, with the exception o f the tourism centre,&#13;
which will be sold as an ongoing business. The plan also specify actions for financial&#13;
and operational restructuring of the two core business lines, as well as annual monitoring&#13;
o f performance o f these core-activities to ensure that they are runina viable manner.&#13;
&#13;
27.     Nam Papa Laos. A detailed time-bound restructuring plan has been elaborated&#13;
and several restructuring measures like water tariff increases, various cost reduction&#13;
measures and changes in management, have been implemented. The plan sets out the&#13;
main directions for restructuring, including financial restructuring with debt-equity&#13;
conversion and asset revaluation, various cost reduction measures, and better handing o f&#13;
material purchases and production, as well as improved accounts receivables&#13;
management andmonitoring o f overall performance.&#13;
&#13;
28.     Pharmaceutical Factory 3 (PF3).             Following implementation o f several&#13;
restructuring measures, a detailed time-bound restructuring plan has been adopted. Key&#13;
measures in this plan include setting-up strict internal and credit control mechanisms,&#13;
financial restructuring to enable the debt servicing o f existing loans, re-focusing o f&#13;
product-lines along commercial lines and exploration o fjoint venture arrangement with a&#13;
regional pharmaceutical manufacturer to strengthen management capabilities and&#13;
introduce new technologies.        Annual monitoring o f progress in restructuring and in&#13;
profitability are also part o fthe plan.&#13;
&#13;
29.     Executed, through MOF, memoranda of understandingfor the development&#13;
and execution of time-bound restructuring plans with Development Agriculture&#13;
Forestry Industry Group( DAFI) andfour loss-making SOEs which have outstanding,&#13;
non-performing loans in excess of one billion kip, in a manner and substance&#13;
satisfactory to theAssociation.&#13;
&#13;
30.     This Action has been Completed. On January 15, 2004 the Memoranda o f&#13;
Understanding (MOU) for the following 5 SOEs - DAFI; Agriculture Industry&#13;
Development ImportIExport Enterprise; Lao State Fuel Company; Societe Lao Import-&#13;
Export; and Road Bridge Construction Company No.13 -- were signed by the Business&#13;
Promotion Office (BPO), the relevant Ministry and the relevant SOE. The Implementing&#13;
Regulation issued on April 29, 2004 asks the BPO to initiate the development o f time-&#13;
bound restructuring plans and then to implement them, and in developing those plans, to&#13;
explore all restructuring options that maybe necessary to make these SOEs commercially&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 viable. These MOUs are based on an initial assessment o f financial and operational&#13;
 information o f these SOE, andrequire that the adoption o f these time-bound restructuring&#13;
 plansbe completed as soon as possible.&#13;
&#13;
 31.     Completed the financial restructuring of EdL, in a manner and substance&#13;
 satisfactory to the Association, including the revaluation of assets, amendment of&#13;
 selected subsidiary loan agreements, and debt to equity conversions.&#13;
&#13;
 32.     This action has been completed. Financialrestructuring o f EdLhas been carried&#13;
 out; it has revalued assets, amended selected subsidiary loan agreements and completed&#13;
 debt to equity conversions.&#13;
&#13;
 33.&#13;
 recovery principles; and (ii) directed and transparent subsidies, if any, for potable&#13;
         Adopted and publkhed tariff policies and structures incorporating (i) cost&#13;
&#13;
 water supply, telecommunicationssector and Lao Aviation; and adopted a time-bound&#13;
 action plan for implementation of said tariff policies, all in a manner and substance&#13;
satisfactory to theAssociation.&#13;
&#13;
34.      This action has been completed. The Government has revised and published&#13;
new tariff structures in respect o f potable water supply, telecommunications sector and&#13;
Lao aviation in2002 and again in2003, following time-bound action plans, inan effort to&#13;
move tariffs closer to cost-recovery levels. The Government has also adopted explicit&#13;
tariffpolicies, as evident inthe PrimeMinister's Noticesapproving the recommendations&#13;
o f the Ministry o f Construction, Transport, Post and Communication (MCTPC), in&#13;
respect o fpotable water supply, telecommunications sector and Lao Aviation, articulating&#13;
the key principles that will guide tariff policy and tariff changes in future. This includes&#13;
definition o f cost, and cost recovery, triggers and timing for changing tariffs and&#13;
restrictive conditions when directed and transparent subsidies would be acceptable. On&#13;
telecommunications and water these principles are detailed for different types o f services&#13;
as well as for the same service indifferent locations; on Lao aviation, with the proposed&#13;
shift to minority Government shareholding, tariffs are to be formulated on a cost-&#13;
recovery and commercial basis as in the annual business plan, with a few possible&#13;
exceptions that would have to be supported by the Government.&#13;
&#13;
35.     Prepared an Assessment, in a manner and substance satisfactory to the&#13;
Association, that assesses the measures undertaken by the Borrower to :(i) avoid the&#13;
deterioration of the SCBs' risk portfolio; (ii) implement its risk diversification rules;&#13;
and (iii) effectuate the autonomy of SCBs.&#13;
&#13;
36.      The action has been completed. The Bank o f Lao PDR (BOL) has provided&#13;
their summary assessment for each o fthe two SCBs (Lao Development Bank or LDB and&#13;
BCEL), as well as quarterly reports through the FMAC implementationperiod, inrespect&#13;
o f quality o f risk portfolio, risk diversification and concentration, and the autonomy o f&#13;
banks. These assessments and quarterly reports present a mixedpicture showing varying&#13;
degrees of progress in these three areas.         There was portfolio-quality deterioration&#13;
through 2002, but improvements are evident during 2003.             Tighter controls on new&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 lending and the introduction of certification by the International Banking Advisors&#13;
 (IBAs)reduced total lending, but improved the quality of the portfolio. The BOL issued&#13;
 notifications to the banks to restrict lending when incremental or flow NPLs exceeded a&#13;
 threshold; though some o f these enforcement letters were issued late, the SCBs restrained&#13;
 their lending successfully duringthis period; the banks were thus incompliance with this&#13;
 "restricted lendingregime" for more thanthree-quarters o f the time. There were also few&#13;
 "directed" or "policy" loans, suggesting that banks were deciding, with the help o f IBAs,&#13;
 more autonomously and on a more commercial basis. Reductions in risk concentration&#13;
 were however more difficult to achieve, and remains a weakness, given that a large&#13;
 portion o f the NPLs in the largest SCB are accounted for by a few           large private&#13;
 contractors who hadnot beenpaid by the Government for their work.&#13;
&#13;
 37.     Audit, in a manner and substance satisfactory to the Association, the calendar&#13;
year 2001 accounts for SCBs, and for the Agricultural Promotion Bank (APB) the&#13;
 calendaryears 2000 balance sheet and 2001 accounts.&#13;
&#13;
 38.     The action has been completed. The financial statement audits, compliance&#13;
reviews and diagnostic reviews for the SCBs for years 2001 and 2002, and for APB for&#13;
2000 balance sheet and 2001 accounts have been completed according to international&#13;
accounting and auditing standards by the international auditors. The audit reports on&#13;
these banks were reviewed and found to be consistent with the agreed terms of reference&#13;
and the purposes o fthe audits.&#13;
&#13;
39.      Procurement of the professional services of at least two banking advisors, to&#13;
provide advisory services for the management of SCB3, with qualifications and&#13;
experience adequate to carry out their services detailed in terms of reference&#13;
satisfactory to theAssociation.&#13;
&#13;
40.      The action has been completed. The four international bankingadvisors (IBAs)&#13;
with satisfactory qualifications and experience initiated work inthe first quarter of 2003,&#13;
in line with the agreed terms of reference.         This involved comments on new credit&#13;
transactions, reviews o f bank-wide issues and credit risk reviews o f a statistically&#13;
significant sample o fthe total portfolio o f these banks.&#13;
&#13;
41.      Resolution of an aggregate amount of Kip 100 billion equivalent of SCBs non-&#13;
performing loans (IvPLs) of at least ten accounts, in a manner and substance&#13;
