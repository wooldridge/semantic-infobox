I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1    The Decentralization and Improvement of Secondary Education and Polymodal&#13;
Education Development Project (DISEPED), presented in this Staff Appraisal Report, is a&#13;
companion to the Argentina Decentralization and Improvement of Secondary Education&#13;
Project (DISE) which was approved by the Board of Directors on September 12, 1994&#13;
(Ln.3794-AR). In most aspects the projects are similar in their design, the major differences&#13;
being: (i) the provinces participating in the project; (ii) the fact that the DISE project&#13;
incorporates a national-level component while the DISEPED does not; (iii) the DISE does not&#13;
includes a specific curriculum reform subcomponent as the DISEPED which was prepared&#13;
when the new polymodal curriculum design for the secondary education had already been&#13;
developed by the national govemment. The DISE project covers seven provinces, while the&#13;
proposed DISEPED project covers seven additional provinces as well as the Municipality of&#13;
Buenos Aires ' A brief characterization of the eight participating provinces, as well as a&#13;
comparison between the provinces proposed under the proposed DISEPE and the DISE&#13;
projects, can be found in Annex A.&#13;
1.2    Drawing from  the lessons learned from  the implementation of the DISE, the proposed&#13;
DISEPED project will be more flexible regarding the participating provinces. Project&#13;
preparation was carried out with the eight provinces listed below. However, the DISEPED&#13;
design would allow for the reallocation of resources among provinces. A currently non-&#13;
participating province could present its own subproject, fulfill the same conditions agreed&#13;
between the Bank and the Borrower, and thereby become a participant in the project .&#13;
1.3    Each participating province corresponds to a proposed subproject. The preparation of&#13;
the provincial subprojects followed the same general framework, which included three broad&#13;
components. Nevertheless, within the guidelines established for the components, each&#13;
province proposed sub-components and activities tailored to their specific educational needs&#13;
and implementation capacity 2.&#13;
1.4    The proposed project has benefitted from  much of the analytical work previously&#13;
carried out on Argentina. The sector study, Argentina: Reallocating Resources for the&#13;
Improvement of Education 3 defined many of the issues later elaborated upon in the SAR for&#13;
the first secondary education project. Rather than repeat a wealth of information that is&#13;
already available in other places, this SAR attempts to provide a brief synthesis of the major&#13;
issues in the subsector, updating earlier information where appropriate.&#13;
I.     For the purposes of this SAR, 'provinces' is understood to include the 23 provinces and the Municipality&#13;
of buenos Aires. Provinces included under the first project are: C6rdoba, La Pampa, Mendonza, Missiones,&#13;
Neuquen, Rio Negro, and Santa Fe. Provinces to be included under the proposed project are: buenos aires, Chaco,&#13;
Corriventes, Entre Rios, Salta, Santa Cruz, Tucuman, and the Municipality of Buenos Aires.&#13;
2.     The only exception is the province of Buenos Aires subproject which follows a simplified design. This&#13;
province's education sysem was considered too large to be fully addressed by a project of this magnitude. Thus,&#13;
the Buenos Aires subproject would have only two subcomponents to support the province's short term participation&#13;
in the national education reform, as well as a set of studies to assist the province in fully analyzing its secondary&#13;
education sector and developing a more comprehensive future project of its own, that could be financed by the&#13;
Bank.&#13;

1.5   Another substantial contribution to the project preparation process and this appraisal&#13;
report was the presentation, by the federal Ministry of Education, of a comprehensive and&#13;
high-quality Borrower Appraisal Report. In addition to providing an updated analysis of&#13;
sectoral issues from the Borrower's perspective, this document (available in Spanish in the&#13;
project files), contains a full description of the sub-project proposals submitted by each of&#13;
the seven provinces.&#13;
II. SECTORAL BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Background&#13;
Macroeconomic and Social Context&#13;
2.1   Argentina has made great progress in recent years towards stabilizing its economy&#13;
after a long period of economic decline. Inflation, which exceeded 1300 percent annually in&#13;
1990, stood at less than 4 percent for 1994. Economic growth has been strong: GDP grew&#13;
by 6 percent in 1993, and by 7.1 percent in 1994. Fiscal performance at the federal level&#13;
has also improved, thanks in part to an increased tax effort, privatization of state-owned&#13;
industries, and reductions in federal employment. These measures have also been&#13;
accompanied by substantial reform and reorganization in the human resource sectors, which&#13;
has had as a primary strategy the decentralization of service provision to the provincial&#13;
governments. In education, two crucial initiatives were taken: the transfer of secondary&#13;
schools to the Provincial Ministries of Education (PMEs) in 1992, and the passage of a&#13;
comprehensive Federal Education Law in 1993.&#13;
2.2   The Government still faces a number of important challenges in the consolidation of&#13;
these gains, particularly with regard to poverty reduction, unemployment, and the fragile&#13;
fiscal and administrative capacity of many of the provinces. While poverty levels have been&#13;
improving since 1990, poverty nonetheless remains a widespread problem. Poverty is mainly&#13;
an urban phenomenon, since about 85 percent of the population lives in urban areas.&#13;
Economic restructuring in both the public and private sectors has fueled unemployment,&#13;
which was estimated at over 12 percent of the labor force in 1994 and 18 percent in mid-&#13;
1995, up from 10 percent in 1993. Unemployment has been particularly severe among&#13;
youth, women, and unskilled workers, and in the northern provinces, which have suffered&#13;
from long-term economic structural problems as well as external migration.&#13;
2.3   The provision of effective and efficient social services at the provincial level is an&#13;
important precondition for overcoming these social problems. Many provinces, however, are&#13;
currently characterized by fragile administrative capacity and poor financial management&#13;
practices. Fiscal difficulties at the provincial level threaten the federal government's ability&#13;
to predict and control deficit spending, and have generated political opposition to the overall&#13;
reform program.4 In the education sector, although the transfer of secondary schools to the&#13;
provincial level has been an important incentive for the provinces to overhaul current&#13;
management practices, the sheer magnitude of the increase in responsibilities represents an&#13;
4.    Fiscal difficulties in  everal provinces led to violent demonstrations during recent years, which caused the&#13;
federal authorities to intervene in one province to restore order.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
enormous challenge. Strengthening administrative, financial, and technical capacity at the&#13;
provincial level is essential for the consolidation of education reforms.&#13;
Educational Indicators&#13;
2.4   Argentina's population is highly schooled relative to that of other countries in the&#13;
region. Nonetheless, it is ill-prepared in comparison with countries with a similar income&#13;
level and with which it competes in world markets. In 1985, for example, the average years&#13;
of schooling in Argentina (among the population aged 25 years and older) was 6.6 years, the&#13;
highest in Latin America. When the regional distribution of educational services are taken&#13;
into account, however, years of schooling vary significantly, especially among some&#13;
provinces. Average schooling in the City of Buenos Aires is above 8.0 years, while among&#13;
the poorest provinces it resembles the LAC average of 4.4. Korea and Taiwan, for&#13;
comparison, averaged 7.9 and 7.0 years, respectively, more than Argentina and far above the&#13;
LAC average.5 Low levels of education in Argentina are also associated with higher levels&#13;
of poverty; poverty rates progressively decrease as the education of the household head&#13;
increases.&#13;
2.5   Access to education is generally good, although there are important regional&#13;
differences particularly at the secondary level. There is no discernible gender bias in school&#13;
enrollment. Net enrollment rates for school-age children averaged 90 percent for primary&#13;
and 56 percent for secondary schools in 1991 (Annex B, Table Bi), giving Argentina one of&#13;
the highest coverage ratios for secondary education in Latin America. Nationally, coverage&#13;
for secondary education has expanded by almost 50 percent since 1980. According to the&#13;
1991 census, within project provinces, enrollment rates for primary school age children all&#13;
stood above 90 percent in 1991, with the exception of Chaco (89 percent). For the same&#13;
year, coverage of the secondary school age group ranged from a low of 38 percent in Chaco&#13;
to a high of 72 percent in the Municipality of Buenos Aires.&#13;
2.6   Despite relatively high coverage rates, the quality and productivity of the educational&#13;
system is poor. Problems at the secondary level, generally the last stage before students&#13;
enter the labor market, are especially acute. Although transition rates from primary to&#13;
secondary schools are fairly high nationally, only half (50 percent) of the students entering&#13;
secondary school graduate. Available student achievement data further indicate that&#13;
secondary students lack basic skills: in the first national assessment of secondary education&#13;
students' achievement, the national average for correct answers was about 55 percent for&#13;
Spanish and about 49 percent for mathematics. Annex B provides more detailed data on&#13;
Agentina's secondary education and efficiency, and specifically, for the seven project&#13;
provinces.&#13;
Education and the Labor Market&#13;
2.7   Over the next decade, two major trends will affect employment: (i) a strong&#13;
expansion of the labor force (over 2 percent growth per year) due to the growth of the&#13;
working-age population and an increasing participation of women; and (ii) shifts in&#13;
employment opportunities as a consequence of economic modernization and restructuring.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
The latter has been particularly hard on the poorly educated: for example, in October of&#13;
1993 in Greater Buenos Aires, the general unemployment rate was 9.7 percent, but was 22.1&#13;
percent for people without instruction, compared to 11.4 percent for those having completed&#13;
the primary level, 8.1 percent for those with secondary education, and 3.5 percent for those&#13;
with higher education. Wage gaps and labor segmentation have increased significantly as&#13;
evidenced by the sharp increase in returns to tertiary education, reaching historically high&#13;
levels of 25 percent, and by the continuous real wage increases for skilled positions. The&#13;
current government has recognized that if it is to achieve broad-based growth with lower&#13;
unemployment, it will need to invest in improving the skills of the population at large.&#13;
Secondary education needs to be more effective if this is to happen.&#13;
Structure and Management of the Sector&#13;
2.8    The structure of the education sector has undergone a radical transformation in the&#13;
last four years as a result of the transfer of national secondary schools to the provinces in&#13;
1992, and the enactment of a comprehensive new Federal Education Law (FEL) in 1993.&#13;
Administratively, the FEL has redefined the roles of the central and provincial governments.&#13;
Provinces through the Provincial Ministries of Education (PMEs), have the responsibility of&#13;
financing and administering all public pre-university education and teacher pre-service&#13;
training. The central government, through the National Ministry of Culture and Education&#13;
(NMCE), provides policy guidance and technical assistance, establishes basic curricular&#13;
content, monitors the quality of education and offers supplemental funding, mainly targeted&#13;
to programs to promote greater equity.6 Strategic goals outlined by the FEL consist of: (i)&#13;
raising compulsory education from 6 to 10 years, including one year of pre-school (starting&#13;
at age 5) and 9 years of general basic education; (ii) reducing the secondary school cycle&#13;
from 5 or 6 years to 3 and reorienting it to a polymodal structure7; and (iii) updating the&#13;
curriculum of each cycle. Financial, managerial, and pedagogical responsibilities have been&#13;
further outlined in a Federal Education Agreement (Pacto Federal Educativo), which was&#13;
signed by the federal and provincial governments in 1994.&#13;
2.9    Formerly the main providers of educational services at the pre-school and primary&#13;
levels, the provinces are now the principal providers of secondary education and pre-service&#13;
teacher training as well. In terms of both enrollment and financing, municipalities play a&#13;
very limited role, which is largely confined to the primary and preschool levels. The private&#13;
sector is an important provider of educational services at the secondary level, accounting for&#13;
28 percent of secondary enrollment nationwide. The role of the private sector tends to be&#13;
smaller in poorer provinces (e.g. 8 percent of secondary enrollment in Chaco) and larger in&#13;
the more densely populated and higher income provinces, such as Buenos Aires (where it&#13;
represents 29 percent of secondary enrollment). The quality of education varies both by&#13;
province and according to the socioeconomic background of the students.&#13;
2.10 The impact of the transfer in terms of enrollment has been large. In its pre-FEL&#13;
form, secondary education consisted of about 2.2 million students nationwide, of which about&#13;
6.    The organization and structure chart of NMCE and the PMEs appears in Annex C. For a description of&#13;
financial, technical, and administrative responsibilities of the national and provincial governments prior to and after&#13;
the FEL, see Annex C, Table C.2.&#13;
7.  Polymodal, meaning varioua modalities of learning, emphasizes integrated knowledge of four cluster areas -&#13;
humanistic, social, scientific and techrical.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
72 percent were enrolled in public schools and 28 percent in private schools (1991 data).&#13;
Enrollments were also divided between curricular tracks as follows: 76 percent attended the&#13;
baccalaureate and commercial academic track and 24 percent the technical-vocational&#13;
(technical and agricultural) track. The transfer of secondary education services from the&#13;
national to provincial governments affected about 1,100,000 students or 50 percent of total&#13;
secondary students, attending both public (54 percent) and private (46 percent) schools.&#13;
Including transferred students, the seven project provinces contain 1,380,840 secondary&#13;
students -- approximately 64 percent of all secondary students. The percent increase in&#13;
enrollment for the provincial systems as a result of the transfer varies from a low of 25&#13;
percent in Santa Cruz to a high of 3,251 percent in the Municipality of Buenos Aires.&#13;
Education Finance and Expenditures&#13;
2.11 Structure and Trends in Education Spending. Total public spending on education&#13;
as a percent of GDP declined precipitously during the economic crisis of the 1980s. Public&#13;
spending on education fell to 2 percent of GDP in 1989, and was subject to severe&#13;
fluctuations throughout the decade. There has been a concerted effort to direct more&#13;
resources to the education sector over the last five years. As of 1994, total public spending&#13;
on education had climbed to 3.7 percent of GDP (Annex D, Table D. 1). By comparison, the&#13;
Latin American average for education spending as a percent of GDP is 4.1 percent.&#13;
2.12  In addition to the overall increase in spending, the most salient change in the pattem&#13;
of public educational spending in recent years is the drop in the federal share from 31.8&#13;
percent of total spending in 1991 to 18.8 percent in 1994 as a result of the transfer of&#13;
secondary schools to the provinces. The provinces' share rose from 65.9 percent to 78.9&#13;
percent of total public education expenditures during the same period (Table D.1).&#13;
Municipal spending on education represented only about 2.2 percent of the total in 1994.8&#13;
With regard to total public spending on education by all three governmental levels in 1994,&#13;
approximately 50 percent is devoted to primary education, 21 percent to secondary education&#13;
and 18 percent to the post-secondary level, including universities, teacher training and non-&#13;
university institutions and 11 percent to cultural and other programs (Table D.2). The&#13;
Federal Government is by far the largest source of funds for higher education, accounting for&#13;
78 percent of public expenditures at that level (Table D.3). In terms of total public&#13;
expenditure at the national level, education and culture accounted for 2.7 billion pesos or 9.9&#13;
percent of the total federal social budget for 1995, a slight increase from 1994 (2.3 billion&#13;
pesos, or 8.7 percent). Of this total, the federal Ministry of Culture and Education budget&#13;
for 1995 represents 2.4 billion pesos (Charts D. 1 and D.2, and Table D.4).&#13;
2.13 Total education expenditures in the seven project provinces have been steadily&#13;
increasing since 1991, although there remain large disparities between provinces in regard to&#13;
spending on a per-student basis. The percent increase in expenditures from 1991-1993 varied&#13;
between provinces, with the largest increase in the Municipality of Buenos Aires (189&#13;
percent) and the smallest in the province of Buenos Aires (Table D.5. 1). The seven project&#13;
provinces devoted between 22 percent and 32 percent of their total public spending to&#13;
education in 1993 (Table D.6). On average, expenditures on secondary education at the&#13;
provincial level appear to be increasing relative to primary, as would be expected given the&#13;
S.    'Me Municipality of Buenos Aires is included with the provinces in this analysis, and is not included as&#13;
part of municipal spending.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -&#13;
transfers in secondary education. Expenditures on primary education were about 46 percent&#13;
of total expenditures for 1993, down from 52 percent in 1992, while those allocated to&#13;
secondary increased from 17.5 percent in 1992 to 22 percent in 1993. 9 On a per-student&#13;
basis, public expenditure in secondary education ranged from about US$324 in Buenos Aires&#13;
to about US$1,958 in Santa Cruz in 1993 (Table D.7). The share of spending allocated to&#13;
higher and university education is extremely low across all provinces. In all, the seven&#13;
provinces spent about 3.5 billion pesos on education in 1993, or about 51 percent of total&#13;
provincial spending, and 33 percent of total public expenditures on education for 1993.&#13;
2.14 Public Subsidies and Private Education Spending. Public educational spending in&#13;
Argentina includes subsidies to private schools, mainly at the secondary level. Subsidies are&#13;
for partial or total payment of teacher's salaries. A 1985 study indicated that 76 percent of&#13;
all private secondary institutions received subsidies."0 Table D.8 shows total subsidies to&#13;
the private sector in 1991, prior to the transfer. The subsidies totalled 532 million pesos,&#13;
equivalent to 0.29 percent of GDP, with over half coming from the provincial governments&#13;
even before the transfer. The subsidies were the source of approximately one third of the&#13;
total private sector education spending of US$1.7 billion in 1991. Nearly half the subsidies&#13;
(47.6 percent) were paid to schools in the Federal Capital of Buenos Aires and the Province&#13;
of Buenos Aires.&#13;
2.15 Families contribute approximately 19 percent of total educational spending, or 0.73&#13;
percent of GDP (Table D.9). Most private spending is for school fees but a portion is paid&#13;
to school "cooperadoras" operating in public schools that in turn pay minor expenses of the&#13;
school such as maintenance and materials costs not otherwise provided.&#13;
2.16 Shares of Public Spending. Personnel expenditures, mainly teachers' salaries,&#13;
represent the largest share of educational spending. In the seven provinces included in the&#13;
project, teachers' salaries accounted for between 73.8 percent (Santa Cruz) and 98.7 percent&#13;
(Corrientes) of total sector spending in 1993, with most provinces over 85 percent (Table&#13;
D. 10). The high wage bill appears to be more a result of low teacher-student ratios than&#13;
high teacher salaries: teacher salaries declined during the 1980s, and have only recently&#13;
begun to show modest improvement. Nonetheless, high spending on salaries means that few&#13;
resources are available for teaching materials, building maintenance and other important&#13;
educational inputs. Capital spending has declined in real terms in recent years, and&#13;
provinces have been unable to compensate for underinvestment in infrastructure during the&#13;
economic crisis. Existing schools have operated on multiple shifts and demand for new&#13;
school places has often been met by spaces not designed for use as schools.&#13;
2.17 Sources of Education Funding. By far the largest part of education expenditures are&#13;
financed out of general provincial revenues, which are in turn heavily dependent on federal&#13;
sources (Table D. 11). " Federal revenue-sharing was increased in 1991 in part to&#13;
9.     The share of educational resources by subsector is difficult to assess precisely, given the high percentage&#13;
of 'unspecified' expenditures in some provinces (43 % in the case of Buenos Aires).&#13;
10.    Beccaria, Luis A. and Riquelme, G. 'El Gasto Social en Educaci6n y la Distribuci6n del Ingreso',&#13;
Facultad Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales, 1985, in Analisis del Gasto Publico de Educaci6n, Ministerio de&#13;
Educaci6n y Justicia, 1990.&#13;
11    The exceptions within the project provinces are the Province of Buenos Aires, which receives 53 % of&#13;
current revenues from provincial sources, and the Municipality of Buenos Aires, which receives 93 %.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
compensate for the transfer of social services to the provinces. The Federal Law of&#13;
Education also requires that over the next five years, starting ip. 1993, the education budget&#13;
be either doubled gradually with an annual increase of 20 percent, or be increased by 50&#13;
percent as a share of GDP--that is from 4 percent to 6 percent of GDP-- whichever results in&#13;
a larger increase in the education budget. As a result of both, the decentralization of&#13;
secondary schools and the increase of the education budget, federal transfers to the provinces&#13;
of earmarked resources for education increased on average by 38 percent from 1992 to 1993&#13;
(Table D.12).&#13;
2.18 Financial Impact of Decentralization of Secondary Education. The financial&#13;
impact of the decentralization of secondary education to the provinces has not been uniform.&#13;
The cost of assuming the transferred services has varied according to the size of enrollment,&#13;
teacher and personnel costs, and the number and physical condition of the infrastructure of&#13;
the schools transferred (Table B.8). The capacity to meet these transfer costs, in turn, has&#13;
varied among the provinces depending on the status of provincial finances before the&#13;
transfer.&#13;
2.19   Transfers have taken place via negotiated agreements between the federal govemment&#13;
and the provinces. The negotiated agreements, however, considered only the cost of federal&#13;
govemment spending for services prior to the transfer. They did not include provisions to&#13;
level the pay or compensate for quality differentials between the provincial and federally&#13;
transferred teachers, to improve school buildings, or to provide other essential inputs.&#13;
Moreover, while the federal govemment transfers funds to the provinces to cover the salaries&#13;
of former federal teachers, these amounts are deducted from provincial co-participation&#13;
revenues." While the overall growth of revenues appears to have kept up with the growth&#13;
of education spending (Tables D.5.1 and D.5.2) on average, this is not true for all provinces.&#13;
In order to finance the increase in educational spending, therefore, several provinces have&#13;
had either to scramble to find additional savings, or risk running (or worsening) a deficit.&#13;
B. Main Issues in Secondary Education&#13;
2.20 The main issues in secondary education can best be summarized as: (a) low intemal&#13;
efficiency; (b) weak administrative, management, and planning capacity; (c) unsatisfactory&#13;
educational quality; and (d) inadequate school infrastructure.&#13;
Low Internal Efficiency&#13;
2.21   One of the most salient characteristics of the secondary education system is its low&#13;
intemal efficiency, as manifested in high dropout and repetition rates and low student teacher&#13;
ratios. These problems are in tum symptomatic of other underlying difficulties, including&#13;
poor management practices and low educational quality.&#13;
2.22 High Attrition Rates The main efficiency issue in Argentine secondary education is&#13;
the high number of students that do not complete the cycle in each cohort. This high&#13;
12.    The law governing the transfer of education services (Law 24.049/92) states that this deduction will not&#13;
take effect if the province's share of co-participation revenues does not exceed real average monthly levels for 1991,&#13;
or if the increase in co-participation revenues is insufficient to cover the negotiated cost of the transferred schools.&#13;
In these cases, the federal government is obligated to provide additional financing to cover all or part of the costs of&#13;
transferred schools.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
attrition rates are the result of the cumulative effect of repetition and dropout. Average&#13;
repetition rates in secondary education reaches 16 percent in Corrientes and 17 percent in&#13;
Chaco (Table B. 12). There are no reliable data on dropouts rates. However, it can be&#13;
assumed they are significantly higher than repetition, due the high attrition rates that range&#13;
from 52 percent in Tucuman to 75 percent in Corrientes (Table B. 10). Although more work&#13;
needs to be done on the determinants of repetition and high dropout in Argentina,&#13;
inappropriate teaching practices, an outdated curriculum, and the general lack of books and&#13;
materials are likely contributing factors.&#13;
2.23 Low Student-Teacher Ratios. The average number of secondary students per&#13;
teacher is about 8.2 in the project provinces, ranging from 13.30 in Buenos Aires to 6.8 in&#13;
Salta (Table B.9). In contrast, student-teacher ratios stand at 19 to one in Chile, and 22 to&#13;
one in Spain. Low student-teacher ratios are due partly to the cumulative effect of repetition&#13;
and dropout, but also to overstaffing and the poor management of human resources. While&#13;
the low student-teacher ratios strain provincial financial capacity and reduce available funds&#13;
for materials and facility maintenance, they have done little to improve the overall quality of&#13;
education. Given the high absenteeism in the sector and a lack of available substitute&#13;
teachers, student/teacher ratios in the classroom are much higher in practice. During project&#13;
preparation, each province launched a comprehensive Sector Management Productivity Study&#13;
(SMPS) which will pay particular attention to the issue of human resource management. The&#13;
project will support the Action Plans resulting from these diagnostic studies, through&#13;
technical assistance and training of PME staff (see also para 2.47).&#13;
Weak Administrative, Management, and Planning Capacity&#13;
2.24 The enactment of the FEL and the transfer of secondary schools to the provinces have&#13;
highlighted a number of weaknesses in the provinces' capacity to provide quality educational&#13;
services efficiently. Problems include: (a) overcentralization and/or duplications in&#13;
organizational structures; (b) ineffective planning and management procedures; and (c) lack&#13;
of timely and reliable information.&#13;
2.25 Overcentralization/Duplication of Organizational Structures. Several provinces&#13;
maintain essentially dual educational administrations, whereby the Provincial Ministries of&#13;
Education are responsible for secondary education while provincial Councils of Culture and&#13;
Education run the more extensive primary system. This division that has caused substantial&#13;
duplication of responsibilities and staff was addressed by the FEL. As a result many&#13;
provinces are beginning to implement a reorganization of the education administrative&#13;
structures. Even in the absence of a dual system, administrative overstaffing at the central&#13;
level, obsolete norms and administrative procedures, and the lack of a clear distribution of&#13;
functions slow decision making and impede institutional capacity to respond to problems at&#13;
the school level.&#13;
2.26 Ineffective Planning and Management Procedures. Current weaknesses in planning&#13;
capacity do not allow PMEs to anticipate the changing demands within their systems, nor to&#13;
design appropriate strategies to meet challenges such as the increase in enrollment, change in&#13;
demand for teachers or subject specialties, or the need to alter resource allocation to balance&#13;
social and educational disparities. In the absence of reliable information, planning and&#13;
budgeting are generally done according to the "incremental" approach of adding extra&#13;
resources to past patterns of expenditure (whether effective or not). Lack of hardware,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
software and trained administrative staff further contribute to long delays in processing&#13;
information important to both planning and management. The gulf between information,&#13;
action, and levels of authority has eroded overall accountability within the system, and&#13;
allowed certain common practices, such as teacher absenteeism, to go essentially unchecked.&#13;
2.27 Lack of Timely and Reliable Information. The lack of essential information&#13;
needed for educational decision-making is not confined to the provincial level. Education&#13;
statistics were developed without national coordination; hence, they do not necessarily&#13;
conform to each other or to the national system, which is currently being improved. The&#13;
absence of reliable information about school outputs (as indicated by student learning and&#13;
completion rates), school staff, student costs and administrative costs, makes it impossible for&#13;
the PMEs to monitor school system performance, or to design programs to compensate for&#13;
educational or social inequities.&#13;
Unsatisfactory Educational Quality&#13;
2.28 The available evidence on the low quality of student learning includes the generally&#13;
poor performance on the first national assessment test. Low learning levels, in turn, are&#13;
related to the poor quality of educational inputs, including: (a) shortages of educational&#13;
materials; (e) inadequate teacher training; (e) irrelevance of curricular content; and (e) poor&#13;
school management and lack of school-based initiatives.&#13;
2.29 Shortage of Educational Materials. Many of Argentina's public secondary schools&#13;
students have very limited access to textbooks, libraries, laboratories, computers and other&#13;
complementary educational materials such as maps, globes and dictionaries. In most of the&#13;
project provinces, students have had to rely largely on photocopied handouts and lessons&#13;
copied from the blackboard. Existing laboratories for basic science are poorly equipped and&#13;
outdated. Where available, computers are generally donated by parents' associations, and&#13;
hence are much more likely to be available in middle class schools. Furthermore, when&#13;
equipment and materials were provided in the past, they were rarely supported by adequate&#13;
training of teachers in how effectively to use or maintain them.&#13;
2.30 Inadequate Teacher Training. Secondary Education Teachers are poorly prepared.&#13;
Over the last twenty years large budget allocations for salaries have led to scarcity of&#13;
resources or investments in teacher in-service training. What training did take place was&#13;
heterogenous, and before the FEL there were no national norms or evaluation of the teacher&#13;
education institutions. Training at the provincial level tended to be poorly designed, with&#13;
limited use of new technologies or innovative strategies.&#13;
2.31 Lack of Relevance of Curriculum Content. In both the general secondary and&#13;
technical-vocational areas, the curriculum is obsolete. Curriculum changes in the last twenty&#13;
years have occurred by adding new programs rather than reexamining the content of existing&#13;
programs. Too many disciplines and a fragmented presentation of knowledge limit the&#13;
learning time spent on basic content. The curricular changes mandated by the FEL has&#13;
already started in a context of a long term strategy.&#13;
2.32 Poor School Management and Lack of School-Based Initiatives. Under current&#13;
administrative and management practices, schools have virtually no control over their human&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
and financial resources nor incentives to improve quality. In general the PMEs consist of a&#13;
centralized and top-down hierarchy which removes decision-making authority from schools.&#13;
School directors play more of a bureaucratic than a pedagogical leadership role, and there are&#13;
no means to encourage on-site participation to detect school problems and implement&#13;
solutions.&#13;
Inadequate School Infrastructure&#13;
2.33 The expansion of secondary education over the past decade has not been supported by&#13;
investments in improving school infrastructure. Weak management capacity has led to&#13;
inefficient use of existing facilities and a lack of resources for maintenance. In areas of high&#13;
population growth and immigration, secondary schools are overcrowded, sharing buildings&#13;
with primary schools or located in semi-converted buildings. In other areas, existing&#13;
infrastructure is underused. Meanwhile, the expansion of compulsory education mandated by&#13;
the Federal Law of Education (FEL) is likely to drive up the demand for school places and&#13;
put additional pressure on existing infrastructure.&#13;
C. Government Sectoral Objectives and Strategy&#13;
2.34  With the transfer of secondary schools to the provinces in 1992, and the enactment of&#13;
a comprehensive Federal Education Law (FEL) in 1993, the Government of Argentina has&#13;
defined a broad strategy for the education sector within an overall strategy of reform of the&#13;
state. Downsizing the bureaucracy, decentralizing sector management to the provinces,&#13;
strengthening provincial capacity to deliver educational services, and improving the quality,&#13;
equity, and efficiency of education are crucial components of this strategy.&#13;
2.35 The FEL has served as a mandate and impetus for a wide range of reforms. It&#13;
defines the objectives for education at all levels, sets out the new structure and funding&#13;
mechanisms for the educational system, expands compulsory education from 6 to 10 years,&#13;
clarifies the respective roles of public and private educational authorities in the new&#13;
decentralized system, emphasizes and gives special priority to the provision of high quality&#13;
education and its measurement, and indicates the direction of the transition toward a new&#13;
educational system.&#13;
2.36 Government efforts to implement the FEL include a wide range of measures and&#13;
accomplishments thus far. At the national level, the National Ministry of Culture and&#13;
Education (NMCE) has streamlined and redesigned its organizational structure, and redefined&#13;
its functions to include strategic planning, education quality evaluation, national coordination&#13;
and technical assistance to the provinces, and correction of educational inequities. A new&#13;
National Education Quality Evaluation System was developed and began operating in 1993.&#13;
A nationwide educational census was carried out in 1994, as part of a strategy to update out-&#13;
of-date and unreliable educational statistics. New curricula for grades 1-9 were issued in&#13;
1994, and the basic description of the new polymodal secondary curriculum is forthcoming&#13;
by the end of 1995. In support of a greater decentralization of management authority to the&#13;
school level, the NMCE has also developed a school-based management program, which is&#13;
training educational supervisors to give technical support for school management initiatives.&#13;
The NMCE is also developing a permanent in-service teacher training program through the&#13;
Federal Network of Continuous Teacher Training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
2.37 Additional sectoral goals outlined in the NMCE's Five Year Plan for 1995-1999&#13;
include: (a) implementing a National Network of Educational Information, which will both&#13;
consolidate provincial information at the national level and provide technical assistance and&#13;
training to provinces in the use of the system; and (b) undertaking "social compensation"&#13;
measures to improve equity in the educational system. In secondary education, two measures&#13;
are foreseen: (i) provision of educational materials in low-income areas; and (ii) helping&#13;
students to obtain their first jobs.&#13;
2.38 Of particular concern throughout Argentina's educational reform process has been the&#13;
assurance of sufficient financial resources for the sector. Additional resources are required&#13;
not only to compensate for the low levels of spending on education during the 1980s, but&#13;
also as an incentive for reform, particularly at the provincial level. The FEL requires that&#13;
the education budgets be either doubled gradually, with an annual increase of 20 percent&#13;
starting in 1993, or be increased by 50 percent as a share of GDP--that is from 4 percent to&#13;
6 percent of GDP-- whichever results in a larger increase in the education budget. In&#13;
upholding its part of this mandate, the Federal government in 1994 signed a National&#13;
Education Agreement with the provinces, whereby it pledged to allocate an additional 3&#13;
billion pesos to the sector over the 1995-1999 time period, largely for investments in&#13;
infrastructure, equipment, and teacher training.&#13;
2.39 While the measures taken so far are important steps in advancing educational reform&#13;
and decentralization, enormous challenges lie ahead to improve the access, quality, efficiency&#13;
and equity of secondary education. The Government has requested Bank support in&#13;
accomplishing these tasks. The Government is also seeking other sources of financing and&#13;
technical support, including the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the World&#13;
Bank for improvements in primary and higher education, respectively.&#13;
D. Bank Role and Strategy&#13;
2.40 To date, the Bank has supported two projects in Argentina's education sector: (a) the&#13;
Vocational Training and Technical Education Project (1980, Ln. 1905-AR, US$58 million)&#13;
aimed at improving CONET's (Consejo Nacional de Educaci6n Tecnica) institutional capacity&#13;
and expanding the quality of Argentina's vocational training system; and (b) the (First)&#13;
Decentralization and Improvement of Secondary Education Project (1994, Ln. 3794-AR,&#13;
US$190 million), which will assist the Government in increasing the quality of secondary&#13;
education in the provinces of Cordoba, La Pampa, Mendonza, Misiones, Neuquen, Rio&#13;
Negro, and Santa Fe.&#13;
2.41 The Vocational Training and Technical Education Project was canceled seven years&#13;
after approval, disbursing less than 2 percent of project funds, because of changes in project&#13;
administration, project complexity, deteriorating economic conditions and political turmoil.&#13;
2.42 The Decentralization and Improvement of Secondary Education Project (DISE)&#13;
companion project to the one presently proposed, is effective. This project is financing&#13;
improvements in the quality and efficiency of secondary education; increase/improve physical&#13;
capacity to serve the secondary school-aged population more effectively, and strengthen&#13;
institutional capacity in these Provincial Ministries of Education under a decentralized&#13;
framework. The project also aims to strengthen the capacity of the National Ministry of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
Culture and Education to provide policy guidance and supervision, as defined by the Federal&#13;
Education Law.&#13;
2.43 The Bank is also supporting the Government's efforts in higher education. Bank&#13;
strategy in higher education involves establishing a competitive environment for the&#13;
improvement of higher education and providing, through a transparent funding mechanism,&#13;
the appropriate incentives for continuous educational efficiency gains and quality&#13;
enhancement. A Higher Education Improvement loan of US$165 million (Ln.3794-AR) to&#13;
support the implementation of legal, management and administrative reforms initiated by&#13;
NMCE was approved by the Board in July 1995.&#13;
2.44 In addition to these education projects, the Bank has assisted the Government during&#13;
the last five years with 13 projects, amounting to approximately US$2.3 billion, in the&#13;
following sectors: infrastructure (four), health (one), public sector reform (five), capital&#13;
markets (two), and agriculture (one).&#13;
2.45  The proposed project supports an integral part of the Bank assistance strategy of&#13;
encouraging the consolidation of education reforms, promoting institutional capacity of&#13;
subnational governments, and improving the coverage, quality and efficiency of educational&#13;
services at the secondary level. As such, the project is fully consistent with the Country&#13;
Assistance Strategy (CAS), which was discussed at the Board on May 4, 1995. The CAS&#13;
defines as one critical role for the Bank Group to support provincial reform, seeking to&#13;
improve the efficiency of delivering public goods and services. In this sense the proposed&#13;
project is consistent with the objectives of the Provincial Reform Project (Loan No.3836-AR)&#13;
as well as with the Provinces I and II projects (Loan Nos. 3280, 1991, and 3877, 1994&#13;
respectively). Regarding the education sector, the CAS analyses the deterioration of public&#13;
education quality as a result of weak sector management, stressing the need to support the&#13;
decentralization of secondary schools by strengthening province's capacity for delivering&#13;
quality, cost-effective education.&#13;
2.46 The proposed project would also reduce poverty in certain provinces by improving&#13;
access of the poor to secondary education. Women's education and development would be&#13;
addressed by the project through the support of curriculum development activities in the&#13;
seven provinces. These activities would be carried out following guidelines which the&#13;
Government is developing to introduce women's issues into the basic curriculum contents, in&#13;
an integrated approach to curriculum development.&#13;
2.47 In order to ensure reliable information about the internal efficiency of secondary&#13;
education in the project, the provincial governments are carrying out a series of Sector&#13;
Management Productivity Studies (SMPS). The SMPSs would: (a) identify inefficiencies in&#13;
the use of human and physical resources at the provincial level; (b) recommend corrective&#13;
actions; and (c) propose alternative designs to decentralize sector management and improve&#13;
internal efficiency. In each province the SMPS would draw on the experience of the up-front&#13;
actions already in place to improve sector management and efficiency. Furthermore, the&#13;
SMPS would take into account the action plans already developed by the PMEs to improve&#13;
efficiency in areas such as administrative structures, norms and procedures, and planning&#13;
capacity. The Terms of Reference and Letter of Invitation for the contracting of the SMPS&#13;
have already received the Bank's no objection, and the bidding process was launched in&#13;
March, 1995. According to this schedule the SMPS were contracted in June, 1995 and prior&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
to negotiations the diagnosis phase of the studies would be completed. During appraisal the&#13;
Bank reviewed the preliminaries proposals and action plans to improve internal efficiency,&#13;
the up-front actions that the provincial governments are taking, as well as the indicators to&#13;
evaluate the project's impact on efficiency improvement (Table J. 1). During negotiations a&#13;
revised version of the targets to be monitored by the project's impact indicators has been&#13;
agreed (Annex J - Table J. 1. 1). This version was based on the early findings of the SMPS.&#13;
It was also agreed that these impact indicators would be adjusted during the first annual&#13;
review of the project, taking into account the recommendation of the SMPS and the&#13;
implementation of the corresponding action plans. Action Plans based on the&#13;
recommendations of the SMPS, and satisfactory to the Bank, would be presented by at least&#13;
one province as a condition of project effectiveness. Action Plans based on the&#13;
recommendations of the respective SMPS, and satisfactory to the Bank, would be presented,&#13;
within eight months of project effectiveness, as a condition for subproject disbursement in&#13;
each remaining province.&#13;
2.48 Other multilateral agencies and donors are supporting or planning to support the&#13;
education sector in Argentina. The IDB and the Government negotiated a Educational&#13;
Reform and Investment Program (US$600 million) to improve the coverage, quality and&#13;
efficiency of pre-school and primary education in the country's 23 provinces and&#13;
Municipality of Buenos Aires. This project will support: (i) strengthening the&#13;
decentralization process by enabling and empowering the school as an educational&#13;
management unit; (ii) improving the efficiency of financial allocation mechanisms to target&#13;
financial resources to the schools; (iii) strengthening teacher pre-service training and&#13;
rationalizing norms governing teachers' service and promotion; (iv) providing technical&#13;
assistance to update curriculum in order to adapt curriculum planning and implementation to&#13;
the guidelines of the new FEL; and (v) renovating schools and providing educational&#13;
equipment. UNESCO is providing technical assistance to the NMCE in the development of a&#13;
school-based management program. This program is being implemented in selected&#13;
provinces, and aims to strengthen school management and autonomy, train school directors,&#13;
and develop educational materials. In addition, the Organization of American States (OAS)&#13;
is providing assistance to the NMCE and provinces in the areas of educational management,&#13;
budgeting and financing, and in the implementation of an infrastructure survey in primary,&#13;
technical and higher education.&#13;
E. Lessons Learned&#13;
2.49 The lessons presented below draw on the experience of the two education projects to&#13;
date, as well as on Bank's more recent lending experiences in Argetina's social sectors. This&#13;
has occurred particularly through the Social Sector Management Technical Assistance&#13;
Loan -SSMTAL- (Loan No. 2984-AR, 1989) and the Maternal and Child Health and&#13;
Nutrition Project (Loan No.3643, 1993); the Bank's lending experience to subnational&#13;
governments in Argentina, particularly through the Provincial Development I (Loan No.&#13;
3280, 1991), the Provincial Development II (Loan No. 3877, 1994), the Municipal&#13;
Development I (Loan No. 2920, 1988), and the Provincial Reform (Loan No. 3836, 1994);&#13;

2.50 Project Design. To the extent possible, project design should be simple and flexible&#13;
despite the inevitable complexities inherent in social sector projects. Project scope should&#13;
concentrate on a few well-defined objectives and tasks.14 These lessons have been&#13;
incorporated into the proposed project, as follows: the project to be implemented by each&#13;
province includes three main components in addition to well-defined subcomponents for&#13;
institutional strengthening, quality improvements and infrastructure improvements. The&#13;
provincial governments have been fully involved in defining the scope and content of the&#13;
project and ensuring that the objectives and the corresponding tasks correspond with&#13;
provincial needs and are not overly complex.&#13;
2.51 Project Implementation. The location and structure of the project coordination unit&#13;
must balance the advantages and disadvantages of using existing structures or new project&#13;
coordination units to manage projects. Experience indicates that, if the legal and&#13;
administrative framework permits sufficient management autonomy and flexibility,&#13;
strengthening existing agencies is the preferred option. These lessons have been incorporated&#13;
into the proposed project, as follows: Provincial Project Coordination Units (PPCUs), for&#13;
each provincial subproject, will be located in the respective ministries of education, while the&#13;
executing agencies (e.g. for construction) will be located or would report to existing&#13;
ministerial departments. To strengthen PPCUs and ministerial departments involved in&#13;
project coordination or implementation, the project will finance technical assistance and&#13;
short-term training needed to establish management units and a system for monitoring and&#13;
supervising project activities. The PPCUs will be small but staffed by highly qualified and&#13;
experienced personnel within each provincial ministry.&#13;
2.52 Implementation Delays. Delays caused by unfamiliarity with Bank procedures are&#13;
common in the social sectors, in which investment projects are relatively new. Especially&#13;
important is the need to standardized bidding documents and establish procedures that are&#13;
tailored to the needs of each project prior to initiation, to avoid implementation delays.&#13;
These lessons have been incorporated into the proposed project, as follows: this project will&#13;
benefit from the experience acquired by. the National Project Coordination Unit (NPCU)&#13;
from implementing the (First) Decentralization and Improvement of Secondary Education&#13;
Project. Training of the Provincial Ministries of Education (PMEs) staff on procedures will&#13;
be carried out by NPCU as well as Bank staff. Also, procurement document models for&#13;
ICB, NCB and a letter of invitation for consultants have already been agreed upon with the&#13;
Government.&#13;

2.53 Project Sustainability. To ensure that Bank financed education projects will continue&#13;
to produce benefits beyond their completion, countries need to develop or maintain a sense of&#13;
ownership. Involving policy-makers and technical staff from the early stages of project&#13;
identification and design is one of the best strategies to achieve this goal. In the proposed&#13;
DISEPED project the participation of the PMEs, as well as the coordination with the NMCE,&#13;
has been crucial for project ownership. During project preparation provincial education&#13;
administrators and technical staff took an active role in defining their subprojects with the&#13;
technical assistance of the NPCU, which also provided coordination between provinces and&#13;
the NMCE. Other elements of project sustainability are: (i) defining both long and short&#13;
term project objectives so as to facilitate implementation, monitoring, and evaluation; (ii)&#13;
addressing the issue of institutional strengthening for project implementation and evaluation;&#13;
and (iii) addressing from the very beginning the issue of counterpart funding. The proposed&#13;
DISEPED project includes a set of Project Impact Indicators and Project Monitoring&#13;
Indicators (Annex J), agreed between the Federal and provincial levels, and the Bank. The&#13;
institutional strengthening activities to be financed under the project would provide technical&#13;
support for effective project monitoring. The availability of counterpart funds will be&#13;
ensured by the co-financing mechanisms in place between the Federal and provincial&#13;
governments. Furthermore, to avoid delays in subprojects implementation, as well as to&#13;
promote competition among the participating provinces, it was agreed to give a time limit to&#13;
the provinces to: (i) comply with the conditions for project effectiveness; and (ii) start to&#13;
disburse from their subloans. After this time limit, a non-complying or non-disbursing&#13;
province could be dropped in favor of another province, with a reallocation of resources.&#13;
2.54 Interventions Specific to Secondary Education. A number of areas that have been&#13;
demonstrated to have particular impact, and that have been taken into account in the project&#13;
design, include: (i) improving general education, especially in basic studies such as math,&#13;
science, and language, given that worker flexibility is thereby increasing; (ii) promoting&#13;
better access to secondary education, especially among the poor and rural population, to&#13;
improve their chances for future training and their ability to earn higher incomes; (iii)&#13;
supporting teacher training, especially in general subject matter knowledge and improvement&#13;
of teaching skills, with the use of textbooks and other educational resources; and (iv)&#13;
providing technical assistance to help governments implement curriculum reform proposals&#13;
and improve institutional capacity.&#13;
m. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives&#13;
3.1   The objectives of the project are to: (a) strengthen institutional capacity in the&#13;
Provincial Ministries of Education (PMEs) under a decentralized framework; (b) increase the&#13;
quality and efficiency of secondary education in the selected PMEs; and (c) increase/improve&#13;
physical capacity to serve the secondary school-aged population more effectively.&#13;
B. Project Components&#13;
3.2   The project would consist of seven subprojects including three components: (i)&#13;
institutional strengthening; (ii) education quality improvement; and (iii) infrastructure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
improvement"5. Within this general framework, each province has developed a proposal&#13;
tailored to its own identified needs. Despite having subcomponents with the same name in&#13;
different subprojects, these vary in design, orientation, and content among provinces on the&#13;
basis of local conditions and requirements. The following is a general description of the&#13;
project components. A detailed description of each subproject is contained in the Borrower&#13;
Appraisal Report found in the project files.&#13;
C. Project Description"6&#13;
Institutional Strengthening (US$32.3 million including contingencies, or 20 percent of&#13;
total project cost).&#13;
3.3   To overcome management deficiencies and complexities, as well as to improve&#13;
internal efficiency, the project would contain an institutional strengthening component. One&#13;
of the main guidelines to implement this component would be the Action Plans based on the&#13;
recommendations of the Sector Management Productivity Studies (SMPS). To address sector&#13;
inefficiencies, a variety of activities have been grouped under the Improvement of&#13;
Educational Administration subcomponent, such as institutional reorganization of the PMEs,&#13;
improvement of administrative procedures and strengthening of planning capacity. During&#13;
project preparation the PMEs, with the technical assistance of the NPCU, prepared a&#13;
diagnosis of sector organization and management inefficiencies, and proposed the activities&#13;
that should be implemented to improve efficiency. Based on these proposals the project was&#13;
appraised and project costs were estimated. To refine the diagnosis already carried out by&#13;
the PMEs and, in particular, to design an implementation strategy of these activities, a Sector&#13;
Management Productivity Study (SMPS) will be carried out for each province from June to&#13;
December 1995 (para. 2.47). The SMPS would refine the diagnoses of sector organization&#13;
complexities and managerial inefficiencies carried out during project preparation. More&#13;
specifically, the expected product of the SMPS is an action plan to implement the activities&#13;
identified early by the PMEs during project preparation. To improve the PMEs planning and&#13;
managerial capacity the institutional strengthening component would also include the&#13;
implementation of a management information system and an education quality evaluation&#13;
system as well as the training of administrative and management staff.&#13;
3.4   The institutional strengthening component would have four sub-components:(i)&#13;
improvement of educational administration; (ii) development of a management information&#13;
system (MIS); (iii) development of an education quality evaluation system (EQUES) and (iv)&#13;
training of administrative and management staff. The subproject for Buenos Aires province&#13;
would have only the MIS and EQUES sub-components and a sub-component of studies&#13;
designed to set the basis for a more tailored institutional strengthening component in a&#13;
possible future project. The following table summarizes the institutional strengthening&#13;
component and sub-component for each for each province.&#13;
15.   The Province of Buenos Aires subproject would only have a simplified component of institutional&#13;
strengthening and a subcomponent of studies, both in the institutional strengthening and in the quality improvement&#13;
components.&#13;
16.   The sum of the components in percent will not add up to 100% since they do not include the Project&#13;
Coordination Units, which represent 5 % of total project cost.&#13;

3.5   Improvement of Educational Administration Component. To ensure that the&#13;
provinces have the necessary organizational structures to carry out responsibilities defined by&#13;
the FEL, and to improve decision making and administrative procedures, the project would&#13;
support: (a) the strengthening of the capacity of the PMEs in strategic planning and&#13;
monitoring of the school system; (b) the modernization of key central units, in particular&#13;
those responsible by planning, budgeting and monitoring; (c) the decentralization of some&#13;
administrative units; and (d) the establishment of regulatory framework under which the new&#13;
decentralized structures would function. Specifically, the project would finance technical&#13;
assistance to support the implementation of the new structures, functions, and administrative&#13;
and management procedures; modem office technology such as computers and software to&#13;
promote more efficient administrative procedures; the preparation of manuals to guide the&#13;
implementation of new procedures; and the design and implementation of new methodologies&#13;
for budget and financial planning and for monitoring of management performance. The&#13;
recommendations and action plans based on the SMPS for each province would provide the&#13;
guidelines for the implementation of the activities proposed under this sub-component. Final&#13;
versions of the terms of reference for consultant services to designed and implement the&#13;
institutional and administrative reorganization activities were presented prior to negotiations.&#13;
3.6   Development of Management Information Systems (MIS). The project would&#13;
support the development of a modern MIS system which is user-friendly and which&#13;
emphasize the timeliness and the usefulness of information produced. The new MIS systems&#13;
would be developed within each provincial government and would be extended to Regional&#13;
Centers or schools, while also being linked to the National Education Information Network.&#13;
The MIS would integrate modules for educational statistics, financial information, physical&#13;
inventory, human resources management, and educational research. To design an MIS, the&#13;
project would finance technical assistance; computers and software; and printed test taking&#13;
material. The final version of TORs for consultant services to develop and implement a&#13;
management information system at the provincial/local level were presented prior to&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
3.7   Development of a Education Quality Evaluation Systems (EQUES). Development&#13;
of the EQUES system would provide PMEs with data on school characteristics, on teaching&#13;
and management staff, and on student achievement in basic disciplines such&#13;
as mathematics, language, and science, which would permit national and subnational&#13;
authorities to monitor progress towards academic goals. It would also permit these&#13;
authorities to identify subnational governments or schools which need special assistance. The&#13;
provincial EQUES would be articulated with the National Education Quality Evaluation&#13;
System (NEQUES) in order to avoid duplication and to ensure interchange of technical&#13;
information and assessment findings. To design and implement EQUES systems, the project&#13;
would support: (i) national and foreign technical assistance; (ii) computer equipment; (iii)&#13;
training materials and manuals; (iv) preparation of standardized tests; and (v) the operational&#13;
activities needed to implement student assessments such as printing, storage and application&#13;
of the tests, fares and per diems. The final version of the TORs for consultant services to&#13;
develop and implement a student assessment system were sent to the Bank prior to&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
3.8   Training of Management and Administrative Staff. This subcomponent would&#13;
include all of the training activities required for ensuring the successful implementation of the&#13;
project's institutional strengthening activities. For each sub-component training would be&#13;
targeted to central and regional management and administrative staff as well as school&#13;
personnel. Training in the management information and student assessment system would be&#13;
aimed at system operators, directors, teachers, as well as policy analysts, planners and&#13;
managers. Specifically, the project would support the training of administrative staff; central&#13;
and regional level management staff; and supervisors, school principals and teachers. agreed&#13;
on the preliminary contents. The final version of the TORs for consultant services to&#13;
implement the training activities for management and administrative staff were sent to the&#13;
Bank prior to negotiations.&#13;
3.9   Province of Buenos Aires Studies Sub-Component. During the first two years of&#13;
project execution, the project would finance, in-depth studies in the Province of Buenos Aires&#13;
to analyze existing sector management problems and prepare a project proposal which could&#13;
be financed by the Bank or other sources. The project would support three diagnostic studies&#13;
with action plans in the following areas: (i) management of the secondary subsystem and&#13;
adaptation to the multimodal curricular model; (ii) educational planning; and (iii) structures&#13;
and functions of the supervision system. The final versions of the TORs for consultant&#13;
services to carry out the studies sent to the Bank prior to negotiations.&#13;
Educational Quality Improvement (US$56.3 million, including contingencies, or 34&#13;
percent of total project cost).&#13;
3.10 A major objective of the project is to increase the quality of public secondary&#13;
education as reflected by students' cognitive learning and indicators such as repetition, drop-&#13;
out and completion rates. This goal would be achieved by the provision of an array of inputs&#13;
through a variety of activities. These activities can be grouped under six main&#13;
subcomponents --not all of which are included in every subproject.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
3.11 There are five main subcomponents comprising the bulk of project financing. These&#13;
subcomponents are: (i) textbooks and teaching materials; (ii) staff training in education&#13;
quality improvement; (iii) curriculum development; (iv) school management; and (v) school-&#13;
based grants. The Buenos Aires province would have only a studies sub-component. The&#13;
sub-component by province are shown in Table 3.3 below.&#13;

3.12 Textbooks and Teaching Materials. Research worldwide has shown that the&#13;
availability and proper use of educational resources significantly enhance teaching and&#13;
student learning. Given that availability of educational resources varies widely among schools&#13;
in any given PME, subproject proposals reflect considerable heterogeneity. The project&#13;
would finance: textbooks, libraries, basic science laboratories; learning modules in basic&#13;
areas such as biology, physics, multimedia, information and others; teacher guides; sets of&#13;
supplementary learning materials such as maps, charts and dictionaries; and lastly,&#13;
multimedia equipment such as sets of televisions, videorecorders and cassettes. Textbooks&#13;
and reading books are key inputs in the educational process. Textbooks will be selected&#13;
among those available in the market through a two-stage ICB procedure. First, bidding&#13;
documents will be issued, requesting technical proposals only. The schools will participate&#13;
in the evaluation of the proposals and in making recommendations. Second, the PMEs will&#13;
prepare a short list of qualifying bidders who will be invited to submit new technical and&#13;
economic proposals, revised according to the PMEs' and schools' evaluations and&#13;
recommendations. The final evaluation and selection process will continued as outlined in&#13;
the Standard Bidding Documents. The final list of educational resources to be financed&#13;
during the first year of the project was agreed prior to negotiations.&#13;
3.13 Staff Training in Education Quality Improvement. The project would support&#13;
training within and/or complementing the Federal Network of Continuous Teachers Training&#13;
aimed at updating teacher's skills in basic subject disciplines; adequate use of education&#13;
materials and new technologies such as computers; and preparation of teachers for the&#13;
curriculum changes already underway. The project would also support the training of&#13;
principals and supervisors in the areas of school management and pedagogical monitoring and&#13;
supervision, and technical assistance to design and implement training activities. Different&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
training strategies will be adopted, depending on the size of the provincial school system, and&#13;
on its institutional organization. Teacher's training strategies include: (i) school-based&#13;
workshops; (ii) distance education; and (iii) seminars and more conventional courses.&#13;
Teacher training would generally be provided by local universities and other higher education&#13;
institutions, because this is the arrangement recommended by the national permanent in-&#13;
service teacher training program. Most provinces propose to have the supervisory team&#13;
involved in the provision or monitoring of teachers training activities. Training for&#13;
supervisors and school directors will be delivered through workshops organized by the&#13;
Provincial Ministries of Education, with technical assistance supported by the project.&#13;
Special training for school directors and teachers will be developed for the school based-&#13;
grants component. Taking advantage of the Bank's experience in others countries like Chile,&#13;
the project will support international technical assistance for this specific training activity.&#13;
During appraisal the mission reviewed the training plans for teachers, principals, and&#13;
supervisors for the first two years of the project.&#13;
3.14 Secondary Education Curriculum Development. In response to the FEL mandate,&#13;
the provincial governments are undergoing a process of curriculum reform and/or adaptation&#13;
to the new guidelines. To assist the provinces in this process, the project would support:&#13;
studies to evaluate the impact of prior, and more limited, curricula reforms already&#13;
undertaken by some subnational governments; studies that take stock ("estudios de situaci6n")&#13;
of the curricula presently taught in schools, especially among technical schools in which&#13;
there is very large variance. The project would also support technical assistance for&#13;
curriculum planning and development, especially from specialists in different subject areas.&#13;
The final version of the terms of reference for technical assistance in curriculum planning&#13;
and development, as well for consultant services to carry out the studies were sent to the&#13;
Bank prior to negotiations.&#13;
3.15 School Management. This subcomponent would support the design and&#13;
implementation of school-based institutional development proposals. Such proposals would&#13;
pay special attention to a school's mission statement, division of responsibilities between the&#13;
principal and teachers, and links with the community (especially parents' associations). The&#13;
project would support technical assistance to develop a model institutional development&#13;
proposal. Subsequently, this subcomponent's implementation would be closely linked with&#13;
the staff training and school-based grant subcomponents. The final version of the terms of&#13;
reference for consultant services to implement activities related to the strengthening of school&#13;
management were presented prior to negotiations.&#13;
3.16 School-Based Grants. In addition, the project would support special school-based&#13;
projects designed as a mechanism to encourage school initiatives through competition for&#13;
extra financial resources. Through this grant program, to be implemented from the third&#13;
project year, the project would respond to local teaching conditions and support the&#13;
improvement of learning conditions within the school. The grants will be allocated on a&#13;
competitive basis and each school project would have a duration of one year. The grants&#13;
would be used for funding non-personnel, non-recurrent expenditure activities such as: (a)&#13;
acquiring or developing teaching and learning materials for schools; and (b) implementing&#13;
complementary curricular activities with the participation of parents, teachers and students.&#13;
The project will finance: grants; training of teachers, principals, and supervisors in&#13;
identification of school quality needs and formulation of grant proposals; production of&#13;
dissemination and training materials; and technical assistance- to the planning and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

implementation of the sub-component. The final version of the TORs for consultant services&#13;
to assist in the planning and implementation of the sub-component activities, and the&#13;
implementation plans for the school-based grants were sent to the Bank prior to negotiations.&#13;
3.17 Province of Buenos Aires Studies Sub-Component. During the first two years of&#13;
project execution, the project would finance in-depth studies in the Province of Buenos Aires&#13;
to analyze existing deficiencies in educational quality. The project would support four&#13;
diagnostic studies with action plans in the following areas: (i) curriculum development; (ii)&#13;
improvement of internal efficiency; (iii) analysis of external efficiency; and (iv) educational&#13;
innovations linked with the labor market. The final version of the TORs for consultant&#13;
services to carry out the studies on educational quality was presented prior to negotiations.&#13;
Infrastructure Improvement (U$67.0 million including contingencies, or 41 percent of&#13;
total project cost)&#13;
3.18 Under this component the project would support improvements in internal efficiency&#13;
and educational quality, through the adaptation of the infrastructure to the new school&#13;
management model and curriculum. High priority was given to the rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance of the infrastructure (85 percent of included construction areas). Extensions,&#13;
substitutions of deteriorated existing buildings and new constructions have only been&#13;
considered in well justified-in cases. The infrastructure component has the following sub-&#13;
components: (i) rehabilitation/maintenance; (ii) substitutions and extensions; and (iii) new&#13;
constructions. The subcomponents proposed for each province are shown bellow:&#13;

3.19 A breakdown of constructions areas and costs by sub-component shows that new&#13;
construction represents 2.1 percent of the total component cost, compared with 57 percent&#13;
that would be spent on rehabilitation and maintenance.&#13;

3.20  The project would support the construction of one new school. Additionally, the&#13;
project would finance the rehabilitation of about 80 disadvantaged urban and rural secondary&#13;
schools to be adapted to the new polymodal education, many of which were recently&#13;
transferred from the national government. School renovation projects would be selected on&#13;
the basis of their cost-effectiveness and provincial commitment to their sustained&#13;
maintenance. Furthermore, some 30 schools would undergo expansion and approximately 10&#13;
schools would be rebuilt on the same site or region. A final version of the contracts of the&#13;
technical plans, preliminary architectural designs, construction specification and preparation&#13;
of sites for all civil works to be included during the first and second year of the project has&#13;
been presented at negotiations.&#13;
3.21 The project would also support improvements in physical planning capacity and the&#13;
establishment or strengthening of ongoing maintenance programs. These activities, however,&#13;
will be financed under the institutional strengthening component. The technical, financial,&#13;
disbursement, managerial and logistical learning experience achieved in school remodeling in&#13;
many provincial governments through the Bank's Provinces I Project (Loan N. 3280, 1991),&#13;
would also be expected to benefit this project.&#13;
IV. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING PLAN&#13;
A. Cost of the Project&#13;
4.1    The total cost of the project is estimated at US$164.4 million based on prices of April&#13;
1995. The total foreign exchange cost is estimated at US$18.3 million, or about 11 percent&#13;
of the total cost. Table 4.1 summarizes the estimated project costs by component and&#13;
subcomponents. Detailed project costs for the provincial subprojects are shown in Annex F,&#13;
Tables F. 1-1l l.&#13;
Contingency Allowances&#13;
4.2   Physical contingencies amount to 12 percent of base costs for civil works and&#13;
maintenance of infrastructure, 5 percent of base costs for goods and equipment, and 3&#13;
percent of base costs for operating expenditures. No physical contingencies have been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
included for consulting services and training. Price contingencies for foreign costs are based&#13;
on Bank calculations of international inflation. Local cost price contingencies are based on&#13;
local inflation for the 1996-2000 period.&#13;
Duties and Taxes&#13;
4.3   Locally procured and imported goods necessary for the project are subject to a 21&#13;
percent value-added tax. Imported goods will be exempt from customs tax. Taxes&#13;
associated with the project amount to about US$12.3 million.&#13;
B. Financing Plan&#13;
4.4   The proposed project would be financed by a Bank loan of US$115.5 million or 70&#13;
percent of total project cost. The loan would cover 100 percent of foreign exchange&#13;
expenditures and about 84 percent of estimated local costs (excluding taxes). Given the&#13;
social nature of the project, the bulk of project costs consists of local expenditures, mainly&#13;
comprising technical assistance for the implementation of Action Plans based on the&#13;
recommendations of the Sector Management Productivity Studies; a management information&#13;
system and a student assessment system; curriculum development; teacher training, and&#13;
activities related with quality improvement of secondary education; and maintenance of&#13;
school facilities. The Government of Argentina would finance the remaining US$48 million&#13;
(including duties and taxes). The proposed project cost sharing is in line with current Bank&#13;
guidelines given the social character of the project and its future impact on children in&#13;
outlying urban and rural areas who will benefit from increased social and economic&#13;
opportunities. Tables 4.2 and 4.3 show the project financing plan with a breakdown by&#13;
expenditures categories, for the total cost and for each province, respectively.&#13;

C. Education Sector Budget for FY95 and Beyond&#13;
4.5    The Budget Law for 1995 provides 2.7 billion pesos for expenditures on education&#13;
and culture for the national administration'7, which includes educational expenditures of&#13;
entities other than the NMCE. The NMCE budget itself is 2.446.9 billion pesos, which&#13;
represents an increase of 21 percent over 1994 (Annex D, Charts 1 and 2 and Table D. 10).&#13;
The budget for education and culture amounts to 5.7 percent of the total national&#13;
administration budget and 9.8 percent of the national social sector budget. The mandate of&#13;
the Federal Education Law to provide the necessary resources for revitalizing the sector&#13;
(para. 2.17), is an ambitious goal that so far is being achieved.&#13;
4.6      The 1996 budgets for the participating provinces are under preparation.  While some&#13;
provinces have already made provision for counterpart financing in their 1996 budget, other&#13;
provinces would need to do so. During negotiations assurances were sought from the&#13;
17.      National administration includes central government, decentralized agencies, and special accounts, that&#13;
undertake expendituresl at the natioral level.&#13;

D. Recurrent Expenditures Arising from the Project&#13;
4.7    The proposed project will give rise to some incremental operating costs that will&#13;
continue after the project is completed, such as the costs of replenishment of educational&#13;
resources, infrastructure and equipment maintenance, operating expenditures, and personnel&#13;
for the provincial/municipal Management Information and Educational Quality Evaluation&#13;
Systems. These are expected to total $4.6 million pesos in 2000, the last year of project&#13;
implementation, and subsequent years (Table 4.4)&#13;

E. Project Sustainability&#13;
4.8    The effect of the proposed project on total sector costs and the ability of the&#13;
participating provincial governments to sustain the expenditures that will result from project&#13;
implementation are important questions. Annex D, Tables D. 13-D.20 show projected&#13;
recurrent spending for education that would result from the project for the period 2000&#13;
through 2010. Recurrent expenditures during this period are expected to range from&#13;
US$200,000 per year in the Province of Buenos Aires to US$6.4 million in the Province of&#13;
Entre Rios. From the point of view of sustainability, these data show that additional&#13;
recurrent expenditures would represent in most cases less than 1 percent of the estimated&#13;
sector budget projected for the year, equivalent to less than 5 percent of the forecast&#13;
secondary education budgets of provincial education ministries. This increase is within the&#13;
financial capacity of the provinces, especially when considering the importance provincial&#13;
governments attach to the education sector.&#13;
4.9   The project will also lead to several categories of savings and economic benefits that&#13;
will help offset the increased recurrent costs. As presented in Annex E, under the&#13;
assumptions stated, estimates of partial benefits that will accrue to the project provinces&#13;
would be on the order of US$442 million per year around the year 2000 and beyond, once&#13;
the project is in operation and its programs take effect. These estimated benefits include&#13;
savings from reduced repetition (US$20.6 million), incremental earnings of students who&#13;
otherwise would not complete the secondary level (US$17.2 million), an improvement in&#13;
student/teacher ratio from 7:1 to 9:1 (US$350 million), and a five percent reduction in&#13;
administrative costs of Provincial Ministries of Education (US$2.7 million).&#13;
&#13;

V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
A. Status of Preparation&#13;
5.1   Consultants hired for the preparation of various project components and to&#13;
provide assistance to the Provincial Ministries of Education (PMEs) were financed by&#13;
grant funds from the Japanese Government. Each project component and&#13;
subcomponent is consistent with the Government and Bank's sector policies,&#13;
objectives, and strategies. At the national level project preparation was coordinated&#13;
by the National Project Coordination Unit (NPCU), already established for the (First)&#13;
Decentralization and Improvement of Secondary Education Project, under the&#13;
Subsecretariat of Programming and Education Management (SUPEM) which, in turn,&#13;
reports to the Secretariat of Educational Programming and Evaluation of the National&#13;
Ministry of Culture and Education (NMCE). At the provincial level, Provincial&#13;
Project Preparation Units (PPPUs) were established in the PMEs, and prepared their&#13;
respective provincial subprojects with the technical assistance of the NPCU. The&#13;
Bank provided substantial technical assistance to project preparation at both the&#13;
national and the provincial levels.&#13;
B. Implementation Schedule&#13;
5.2   The project is expected to be implemented over a five-year period, from&#13;
January 1996 to December 2000. The NPCU, the Provincial Project Coordination&#13;
Units (PPCUs), and the Bank would update and review the implementation schedules&#13;
during the annual reviews (see para. 5.20). The implementation schedule is shown in&#13;
Annex I, while yearly implementation targets (including a monitoring indicators&#13;
matrix) are shown in Annex J.&#13;
C. Project Management&#13;
5.3   Project implementation would be carried out within the existing organizational&#13;
structures of the NMCE and PMEs, supported by project coordination units at the&#13;
national and provincial levels. At the national level, project implementation would be&#13;
coordinated by the existing NPCU, which would be strengthened. As in the first&#13;
project, the overall responsibility for project implementation will remain with the&#13;
Secretariat of Educational Programming and Evaluation, while the SUPEM will be&#13;
responsible for project execution and coordination. Provincial subproject&#13;
implementation would be coordinated by the PPCUs, which will consist of a small&#13;
management structure with programming and service functions. These functions will&#13;
include: (a) planning, programming, monitoring, and evaluation of subproject&#13;
activities; (b) procurement of civil works, goods and services; (c) hiring of technical&#13;
assistance and personnel; (d) budgeting, financing, disbursement and accounting of the&#13;
subprojects; and (e) hiring of independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank. The&#13;
Project Coordinator will report to the provincial government's Minister of Education.&#13;
The PPCU will be staffed by personnel from within the existing ministerial structures,&#13;
and additional personnel will be financed by the project. Annex H describes the&#13;
project structures as well as NPCU and PPCU functions, responsibilities and staffing.&#13;
Chart H. 1 shows the organizational structure for project management and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
implementation. Table H. 1 is a provisional distribution of functions and&#13;
responsibilities among the Bank, the national government, the provincial governments,&#13;
the NPCU, and the PPCUs. During negotiations the government confirmed the&#13;
distribution of responsibilities explained in Table I. 1. Agreement was reached that&#13;
the Provincial Ministries of Education would maintain the PPCU staff or similar&#13;
qualified professionals during subproject execution. The establishment and staffing of&#13;
PPCUs organization in at least one province is a condition of project effectiveness.&#13;
The remaining provinces also have to take similar action as a condition of&#13;
disbursement of their respective subprojects, within eight months of the project&#13;
effectiveness date.&#13;
5.4   The NMCE would be responsible for coordination with the Bank and other&#13;
federal ministries. The NPCU would have responsibility for the following areas: (a)&#13;
coordinating overall project implementation and providing technical assistance to the&#13;
provinces; (b) serving as the technical, administrative, and operational liaison with the&#13;
World Bank during the life of the project; (c) monitoring project execution according&#13;
to the project monitoring matrix described in Annex J, Tables J.2. 1-J.2.9; (d)&#13;
preparing administrative and technical guidelines and procedures required for project&#13;
implementation; (e) submitting to the Bank disbursement applications for civil works,&#13;
goods, and consulting services; (f) facilitating project supervision by the Bank; and&#13;
(g) periodically reporting to the NMCE and the Bank on project implementation.&#13;
PPCUs on the other hand would be responsible for: (a) coordinating and supervising&#13;
implementation of their respective subprojects; (b) coordinating and administering the&#13;
bidding procedures for civil works, goods, and services according to their subproject&#13;
implementation schedule; (c) submitting to the NPCU disbursement applications for&#13;
civil works, goods, and consulting services; (d) coordinating PPCU activities with&#13;
PMEs, subprovincial offices, NGOs and other participating entities; and (e)&#13;
periodically reporting to the provincial Ministers of Education and the NMCE on&#13;
project implementation. Project coordinators would be assisted in policy and&#13;
monitoring by a Project Consultative Council (PCC). The PCC would consist of the&#13;
national Minister of Education or a representative, the Secretary of Educational&#13;
Programming and Evaluation, and the provincial Ministers of Education from all&#13;
project provinces. The main responsibility of the PCC would be to analyze policy&#13;
and strategy, monitor project implementation targets, and resolve any implementation&#13;
or organizational problems that may arise. Annex H, Table H.2 describes in more&#13;
detail the staffing requirements of each PPCU. Salaries of staff employed by the&#13;
different subprojects would be fully paid out of project funds. The resolution&#13;
establishing the Project Consultative Council (Instancia de Consulta Institucional),&#13;
will be promulgated prior to project effectiveness.&#13;
5.5   Loan Arrangements. The proceeds of the loan will be on-lent from the&#13;
Ministry of Economy to the Provincial Governments who will have the obligation to&#13;
repay to the Federal Government, under the same terms and conditions as the Bank&#13;
loan. To this effect, a subsidiary loan agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, will be&#13;
signed between the Ministry of Economy, NMCE, and each participating province.&#13;
These subsidiary loan agreements will include a description of the provinces' financial&#13;
and project obligations as well as provisions for withdrawals, conditionalities,&#13;
remedies, and bearing of the foreign exchange risk. During negotiations the Bank&#13;
reviewed the final draft subsidiary agreements between the Ministry of Economy, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
NMCE and the PMEs. The subsidiary agreements will contain provisions regarding&#13;
the possibility of using co-participaci6n funds to meet provincial counterpart funding&#13;
obligations for the project, in cases when these are not readily made available.&#13;
Signed subsidiary agreements approved by the legislature in at least one province is a&#13;
condition of loan effectiveness. The remaining provinces will fulfill this condition for&#13;
disbursement of their respective subprojects, within eight months of loan&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
5.6    To ensure a better implementation the loan agreement will include the&#13;
possibility to reallocate unused funds which could become available if a participating&#13;
province: (i) had not signed the subsidiary loan agreement within the eight months&#13;
period following the loan effectiveness; (ii) requires the reduction of the amount of its&#13;
subloan; or (iii) had disbursed less than 20 percent of its subloan after a period of 30&#13;
months after loan effectiveness. In either case the National Ministry of Education, in&#13;
agreement with the Bank, could propose the use of the available funds to finance: (i)&#13;
a subproject of a replacing province, under the same conditions as the present&#13;
participating provinces; (ii) a third group of provinces, which were not yet covered&#13;
neither by the Decentralization and Improvement of Secondary Education project&#13;
(DISE), or the proposed Decentralization and Improvement of Secondary Education&#13;
and Polymodal Education Development project (DISEPED). In this second alternative&#13;
the borrower would: (i) execute the project on behalf of the selected third group of&#13;
provinces; (ii) provide the counterpart funds with resources allocated in the NMCE's&#13;
annual budget; (iii) submit to the Bank appraisal the subproject of the selected third&#13;
group province; and (iv) sign a subsidiary loan agreement, satisfactory to the Bank,&#13;
with the selected third group provinces specifying conditions for the repayment of the&#13;
subloan.&#13;
D. Procurement&#13;
5.7   The project would involve procurement of civil works, equipment, furniture,&#13;
teaching materials and equipment, consulting services, and training. Procurement of&#13;
goods, works and services, subject to Bank financing, would be carried out by the&#13;
eight PPCUs. Although procurement would be implemented in a decentralized&#13;
manner, all provinces would follow the same Bank guidelines and would be assisted&#13;
by the NPCU, in order to assure that the same methods, procedures and criteria&#13;
would be followed by each province. Five NPCU staff would be in charge of&#13;
procurement activities, supervising the procurement units of the PPCUs, and assuring&#13;
that the Bank specifications would be fully satisfied. At the provincial level, each&#13;
PPCU would have at least three staff in charge of implementing procurement&#13;
activities. Criteria to hire these specialists have been agreed between the NPCU and&#13;
the Bank, and the NPCU would supervise the hiring of these specialists in order to&#13;
ensure that they have the required skills. No recent assessment of procurement&#13;
procedures in Argentina has been carried out. However, there is no significant&#13;
inconsistency between Federal and Provincial procedures and Bank guidelines.&#13;
Procurement methods would require documents and procedures as follows:&#13;
(a)   International competitive bidding (ICB) would require the use of Bank&#13;
issued standard bidding documents, which are mandatory. Under ICB,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
domestic preference may be applied, in accordance with Bank&#13;
guidelines for the procurement of goods;&#13;
(b)   Limited international bidding (LIB) would also require the use of Bank-&#13;
issued standard bidding documents;&#13;
(c)   National competitive bidding (NCB) would be carried out using&#13;
standard bidding documents acceptable to the Bank;&#13;
(d)   Local shopping would be carried out according to procedures&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, and will require a minirmum of three price&#13;
quotations;&#13;
(e)   Selection and appointment of consultants would be done in accordance&#13;
with Bank guidelines for the use of consultants (August 1981). The&#13;
Bank standard form of contract is mandatory for time-based and&#13;
lumpsum based consulting services. Model letter of invitation would be&#13;
also used for the selection of consulting firms.&#13;
(f)   During negotiations the Bank would seek an agreement on the use of&#13;
the aforementioned standard procurement documents and inform the&#13;
borrower that any proposed change to Bank standard procurement&#13;
documentation should be kept to essential aspects and would require&#13;
approval by the Bank.&#13;
5.8   Table 5.1 summarizes procurement methods for the proposed project.&#13;
Procurement for the different categories to be financed with the Bank loan would&#13;
comply with the procedures stated below.&#13;
5.9         Civil Works. The project would allocate US$53.2 million, or 32&#13;
percent of total project cost, mostly to rehabilitate and expand school facilities. Only&#13;
about 10 percent of these resources would be assigned to rebuild schools and&#13;
construct new facilities. Hence, no contracts greater than US$5 million are expected.&#13;
Contracts for works expected to cost between US$300,000 and US$5 million, with an&#13;
aggregate amount of about US$40.3 million, or approximately 25 percent of total&#13;
project cost, would be procured through NCB procedures. Contracts for small works,&#13;
expected to cost less than US$300,000 per contract and about US$12.9 million in&#13;
aggregate, or around eight percent of total project cost, would be procured under&#13;
lumpsum, fixed price contracts, awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from at&#13;
least three qualified domestic contractors in response to a written invitation.&#13;
5.10        Goods.&#13;
(a)   Vehicles, Informatics (computers, peripheral equipment, computer&#13;
software), and communications (fax and photocopying) equipment&#13;
in packages of US$100,000 or more, will be procured on the basis of&#13;
limited international bidding (LIB) procedures among firms that have&#13;
established maintenance services in the country. The estimated amount&#13;
for this bidding procedure would reach a total amount of US$7.5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
million, or 5 percent of total project cost. Packages to cost below&#13;
US$100,000 would be procured through local or international shopping,&#13;
in line with Bank requirements, and are expected to total US$3 million,&#13;
or about 2 percent of total project cost. A total of 12 vehicles are&#13;
expected to be procured during the life of the project. (For distribution&#13;
by year and province see Annex J, Table J.2.1 to J.2.9).&#13;
(b)   Furniture, training materials, books, teaching materials/equipment&#13;
in packages of US$250,000 or more would be procured following ICB&#13;
procedures. Textbooks will be awarded on the basis of two-step ICB&#13;
procedures in accordance with Bank guidelines for all contracts valued&#13;
above US$250,000 each, following the procedures indicated in para.&#13;
3.12. The aggregate for these packages would be approximately&#13;
US$13 million, or 8 percent of total project cost. Packages valued&#13;
between US$100,000 and US$250,000, aggregating to US$17.2&#13;
million, or 10 percent of total project cost, would be procured through&#13;
NCB procedures. Packages below US$100,000 in value would be&#13;
procured through local shopping in line with Bank requirements. These&#13;
packages would total about US$5.3 million, or approximately 3 percent&#13;
of total project cost.&#13;

5.11             Consultant Services.  The project would allocate: (a) US$13.8 million for&#13;
technical assistance and consultants services; (b) US$6.7 million for studies; (c) US$6.3&#13;
million for training consultants; (d) US$6.9 million for NPCU and PPCU personnel, and&#13;
US$4.5 million for minor temporary assignments and support personnel.&#13;
5.12             The cost of land, where construction works will take place, will be entirely&#13;
financed with Government counterpart funds.&#13;
5.13             Prior review.  All prior review  procedures would be undertaken by the Bank&#13;
separately for each one of the eight provincial governments. Contracts would be subject to&#13;
prior review by the Bank according to the following thresholds: (a) for all civil works,&#13;
contracts valued above US$1 million; and for the first NCB civil work contract for each of&#13;
the first three years of the project, for each province; (b) for vehicles, and informatics and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
communication equipment, all contracts valued US$100,000 equivalent or more; and (c) for&#13;
furniture, training and teaching materials and/or equipment, all contracts valued above&#13;
US$250,000. To the extent possible, consulting services will be awarded in the form of&#13;
packages, with terms of reference always requiring prior review by the Bank. Furthermore,&#13;
all documentation for the hiring of consulting firms for contracts valued at US$50,000 or&#13;
more would be subject to prior review by the Bank. All documentation for the hiring of&#13;
individual consultants for contracts valued at US$20,000 or more would also be subject to&#13;
prior review by the Bank. It is expected that about 74 percent of the civil work contracts,&#13;
representing approximately 45 percent of the total civil work costs will be subjected to&#13;
Bank's prior review. For goods, prior review would apply to about 60 percent of the&#13;
contracts, representing approximately 34 percent of the estimated costs for goods. All other&#13;
contracts would be reviewed in the field by sampling on an ex-post basis, during Bank&#13;
supervision missions. If it were determined that procurement was not carried out in&#13;
accordance with agreed procedures, no expenditures for such items would be financed with&#13;
proceeds from the loan and the Special Account would be reimbursed accordingly by the&#13;
Borrower. Table 5.2 summarizes procurement review procedures.&#13;
5.14        Since Bank procurement procedures would be new for many of the Provincial&#13;
Ministries of Education, the NPCU, with Bank support, would organize seminars and a&#13;
support system to help the provinces execute procurement under their respective subprojects.&#13;
The NPCU already has experience with Bank procurement procedures, acquired for the&#13;
(First) Decentralization and Improvement of Secondary Education Project, and will provide&#13;
guidance in accordance with the Bank guidelines, as well as the standard bidding documents&#13;
and other documentation that will be necessary to implement procurement activities. At the&#13;
provincial levels the PPCUs would seek advice and guidance with other Bank project&#13;
implementation units, especially those of the Provincial Development I and II projects (Lns.&#13;
3280-AR 1991-AR, and 3877-AR, and 3994-AR). The final version of bidding documents&#13;
for ICB and NCB and the letter of invitation for consultants has been agreed during&#13;
negotiations.&#13;

E. Accounts and Disbursements&#13;
5.15 The proceeds of the proposed loan are expected to be disbursed in accordance with&#13;
the schedules shown in Table 5.3 and Annex I, over a period of five years. It has been&#13;
assumed that the loan would become effective in January 1996, and that the project's&#13;
estimated completion and closing dates would be December 31, 2000, and June 30, 2001&#13;
respectively. The disbursement period, shorter than the seven-year profile for Latin&#13;
America, was determined after taking into account: a) the advanced status of project&#13;
preparation; and b) strong national and provincial government commitment towards the&#13;
project. The allocation of loan amounts and disbursement percentages are summarized in&#13;
Table 5.3. Disbursements would be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditure (SOE)&#13;
for all expenses except those covered by contracts requiring prior review by the Bank.&#13;
Except for the first contract for each province for the first three years of the project for&#13;
works, fumiture and teaching materials/equipment procured under NCB, SOEs will be used&#13;
for contracts for: (a) civil works not exceeding US$1 million; (b) vehicles, informatics and&#13;
communication equipment costing less than US$100,000; (c) fumiture and teaching&#13;
materials/equipment not exceeding $250,000; and (d) consulting firms and individuals not&#13;
exceeding $50,000 and $20,000 respectively. SOEs will be certified locally by the PPCU of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
the respective province. Disbursements for contracts requiring prior review would be fully&#13;
documented. Relevant documentation in support of SOEs would not be submitted to the&#13;
Bank, but would be retained by the NPCU. Copies of such documents would be supplied to&#13;
the NPCU by the PPPUs and be made available to Bank supervision missions. The NPCU&#13;
will develop a manual (using the World Bank's Disbursement Handbook as a guide) for use&#13;
by the provinces explaining the procedures for reimbursement. This manual will indicate: (a)&#13;
that at monthly intervals (the date to be determined between each PPCU and NPCU), each&#13;
PPCU will submit a request for reimbursement of expenditures using a summary sheet (with&#13;
evidence of payment) or statement of expenditure (in which case evidence of payment will be&#13;
maintained by each PPCU); (b) how direct payment to suppliers and payment in foreign&#13;
currencies will be effected; and (c) the procedures to be stipulated in the disbursement letter,&#13;
and in accordance with technical assistance received during seminars mentioned below. The&#13;
manual will also note that upon receipt of each request for reimbursement by the province,&#13;
the NPCU will have two working days to request the transfer of funds or return the request&#13;
with a detailed explanation of the reason for the return and changes needed to rectify the&#13;
request. Since Bank disbursement procedures would be new for many of the Provincial&#13;
Ministries of Education the NPCU, with Bank support, would organize seminars and a&#13;
support system to help the provinces execute disbursement under their respective subprojects.&#13;
The final version of flow of funds and replenishment schedules has been reviewed during&#13;
negotiations. Retroactive financing is required to facilitate the timely start-up of the project,&#13;
and to begin the gradual implementation of the information and student assessment systems,&#13;
and the preparatory studies for curriculum development and school management. It was&#13;
agreed that the Bank would finance, retroactively, up to US$5 million or about four percent&#13;
of the loan amount, for expenditures incurred up to 12 months prior to loan signing and in&#13;
accordance with Bank procurement guidelines. The mission agreed on a list of activities to be&#13;
considered for retroactive financing, that would include: technical assistance, computer&#13;
equipment and office equipment.&#13;

5.16 Special Account. To facilitate timely project implementation, the National&#13;
Government would establish, maintain and operate, under terms and conditions satisfactory to&#13;
the Bank, a special account in US dollars at a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank. To&#13;
cover the average four-month loan allocation needed by each provincial subproject, the&#13;
special account will have an authorized allocation of US$10 million. An initial deposit of&#13;
US$5 million will be made available, and the full amount of the authorized allocation will be&#13;
released when disbursed amounts reach a level of US$20 million. Subsequently, a specific&#13;
project account with funds advanced by each respective government would be opened by each&#13;
province at a branch of Banco de la Naci6n in the respective locality, or at another&#13;
commercial bank acceptable to the Bank. This specific project account which will include&#13;
counterpart funds will have an average flow of funds sufficient to cover expenditures for two&#13;
months of operation. The NPCU would request the Bank to replenish the special account on&#13;
the basis of standard disbursement procedures, and would replenish the provincial subsidiary&#13;
accounts on a monthly basis upon PPCU's presentation of statement of expenditures or&#13;
summary sheets. Withdrawals from the special account would be supported by sufficiently&#13;
detailed documentation or SOEs in accordance with Bank disbursement procedures.&#13;
F. Audits&#13;
5.17 Annual audits of the Special Account for the project (managed by the National&#13;
Government), and each specific provincial project account, would be performed by the&#13;
Auditorfa General de la Naci6n (AGN) which would be responsible for reviewing the audit&#13;
plan, supervising the audit, ensuring timely reporting, and subcontracting, when necessary,&#13;
independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank. The auditor will: (a) audit all Special&#13;
Accounts, specific project accounts, SOEs, and summary sheets; (b) apply auditing standards&#13;
and procedures satisfactory to the Bank that conform to generally accepted auditing practices;&#13;
(c) carry out its auditing work in a timely manner (an annual report would be presented no&#13;
later than six months after the end of each calendar year); and (d) render an audit opinion or&#13;
provide reasons why such an opinion cannot be rendered.&#13;
G. Project Monitoring, Evaluation, and Supervision&#13;
5.18  In line with project objectives, key efficiency and quality indicators (Impact&#13;
Indicators, Annex J, Table J. 1) will be monitored to facilitate policy discussions and to track&#13;
and support improvements in the overall efficiency and effectiveness of secondary education.&#13;
To support spot-checking over the project's life in any of its subprojects and subcomponents,&#13;
a detailed yearly implementation target matrix has been prepared (Monitoring indicators,&#13;
Annex J, Tables J.2.1-J.2.9). Agreement has been reached on final impact indicators.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
5.19 Overall monitoring and evaluation of the project would the responsibility of the&#13;
NPCU. In order to increase project ownership and to supplement the Bank's scarce&#13;
resources for supervision, the following arrangements have been agreed with the NPCU and&#13;
provincial government's representatives: (a) the NPCU would play an active role in project&#13;
supervision, including the review of TORs and other documentation necessary for project&#13;
execution, prior to sending such documentation to the Bank for no objection; (b) adequate&#13;
resources would be included in the project to allow the national government to conduct close&#13;
supervision in each project province; and (c) the Bank would realize economies of scale by&#13;
combining the supervision of this project with that of the (first) Decentralization and&#13;
Improvement of Secondary Education Project. Supervision arrangements are expected to&#13;
require a total of about 90 staff-weeks, approximately US$360.000 (Bank staff and&#13;
consultants) during project execution.&#13;
5.20 Progress reports would be consolidated by the NPCU and sent to the Bank for review&#13;
no later than five months after completion of each calendar year. These progress reports&#13;
would include: (a) an annual progress report on project implementation; (b) a measure of the&#13;
physical and impact objectives achieved against the monitoring and impact indicators shown&#13;
in Annex J; and (c) an updated and revised project implementation schedule and action plans&#13;
for the implementation of project components during the following year. An Implementation&#13;
Completion Report would be prepared by NPCU and submitted to the Bank no later than six&#13;
months after the closing date of the Loan.&#13;
5.21 The NPCU and the Bank would conduct joint annual implementation reviews no later&#13;
than June 30th of each year to: (a) analyze the previous year's performance and budget&#13;
execution; (b) analyze the proposed work plan and budget for the following year; and (c)&#13;
discuss adjustments to be made in the project's implementation schedule. Agreement has&#13;
been reached on the scope of the annual reviews of the subprojects. During negotiations it&#13;
was agreed that project impact indicators would be reviewed and adjusted as necessary dring&#13;
the first annual review of project implementation. This review would take into account the&#13;
completion of the Sector Management Productivity Studies (SMPS) and the implementation&#13;
of the corresponding action plan to address sector inefficiency.&#13;
5.22 No later than 30 months after loan effectiveness, and with prior approval of the terms&#13;
of reference by the Bank, the NPCU, the PPCUs, and the Bank would conduct a Mid-Term&#13;
Review to analyze project performance. Special attention would be paid to the&#13;
implementation of the action plans, based on the recommendation of the Sector Management&#13;
Productivity Studies (SMPS), to address sector inefficiencies. Progress in the&#13;
implementation of these action plans will be assessed against the reviewed and adjusted&#13;
project impact indicators (Annex J, Table J. 1). An action plan based on the results of the&#13;
review would be implemented within three months of the review's completion. Agreement&#13;
on the scope and content of the Mid-Term Review scope and content of the project Mid-&#13;
Term Review has been reached.&#13;
VI. EXPECTED BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Expected Benefits&#13;
6.1   The project is expected to lead to cost savings as a result of reducing the number of&#13;
secondary education students repeating grades and/or dropping out of school. Other benefits&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
include: (a) increased productivity as a result of a more educated and trainable labor force;&#13;
(b) increased social mobility, especially for students living in deprived urban and less&#13;
productive rural areas; and (c) enhanced sector efficiency, thus creating net savings for the&#13;
education sector which could be reallocated to inputs which have a high impact on&#13;
educational quality. A partial estimate of quantifiable benefits arising from the project is&#13;
provided in Annex E.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
6.2   The risks associated with the project can be classified as direct and indirect. Direct&#13;
risks are: (a) limited implementation capacity at both the national and provincial levels as&#13;
well as limited sectoral experience with Bank-financed projects; and (b) slow implementation&#13;
of new policy decisions arising from the FEL such as the new curriculum content. Indirect&#13;
risks include macroeconomic difficulties that could burden the provinces' financial capacity&#13;
to ensure the availability of counterparts funds.&#13;
6.3   Direct risks will be minimized by: (a) strengthening the NPCU established for the&#13;
(First) Decentralization and Improvement of Secondary Education Project with additional&#13;
technical staff to perform specific functions of monitoring and supervising the provincial&#13;
subprojects in the field; (b) requiring coordination between the NPCU and the PPCUs, which&#13;
would also have a small but highly qualified staff; (c) prior agreement with the NPCU and&#13;
PPCUs on annual targets; and (d) prior agreement on technical assistance activities and&#13;
training that will be supported by the project, including training in procurement,&#13;
disbursements, and other topics related to project implementation. Indirect risks would be&#13;
minimized by ensuring the availability of counterpart funds through the co-financing&#13;
mechanisms in place between the Federal and provincial governments. These risks would be&#13;
further mitigated by allowing for the reallocation of the project funds to a province not&#13;
originally in the project, as explained in para.5.6.&#13;
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
7.1   During negotiations, agreement or assurances were reached with the Government&#13;
of Argentina on the following:&#13;
(a)   Revised version of the impact indicators, on the basis of the Sector&#13;
Management Productivity Studies (SMPS) for each province. (paras. 2.47,&#13;
5.17);&#13;
(b)   Revision and adjustment of the project impact indicators during the first annual&#13;
project review, taking into account the recommendations of the SMPS and the&#13;
implementation of the corresponding action plans (para. 5.21).&#13;
(c)   Final list of educational resources to be financed during the first year of the&#13;
project (para. 3.12);&#13;

the implementation of the action plans based on the recommendations of the&#13;
Sector Management Productivity Studies, to address sector inefficiencies (para.&#13;
5.21).&#13;
7.2   During negotiations. agreement or assurances were reached with the Provincial&#13;
Government of Argentina on the following:&#13;
(a)   Provision of counterpart funds each year during provincial subprojects&#13;
implementation (para.4.6);&#13;
(b)   Agreement to maintain the PPCUs staff or similarly qualified professionals&#13;
during project execution (para.5.3).&#13;
7.3   The following are conditions of effectiveness:&#13;
(a)   The resolution issued by the National Ministry of Education establishing the&#13;
Project Consultative Council (Instancia de Consulta Institucional) (para. 5.4);&#13;
(b)   Action Plan based on the recommendations of the SMPS, of at least one&#13;
province (para. 2.47);&#13;
(c)   Signed subsidiary loan agreement in the same province approved by the&#13;

provinces (para. 2.47).&#13;
(c)   The PPCUs for these same provinces have been established to the satisfaction&#13;
of the Bank (para.5.3).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
B. Recommendation&#13;
7.5   Subject to the above assurance and conditions, the proposed project would constitute a&#13;
suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$115.5 million for the Argentine Republic, repayable in&#13;
15 years with five years of grace using a level repayment of principal pattern.&#13;

THE PROJECT PROVINCES&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    The eight provinces included in the proposed project are Buenos Aires Province,&#13;
Corrientes, Chaco, Entre Rios, Salta, Santa Cruz, Tucuman, and the Municipality of Buenos&#13;
Aires. As in the (First) Decentralization and Improvement of Secondary Education (Loan n.&#13;
3794-AR) approved by the Board of Directors of the World Bank in September 14, 1994,&#13;
these provinces have been selected on the basis of criteria established jointly by the Bank&#13;
and the National Minister of Culture and Education (NMCE). These criteria were to: (i) have&#13;
signed a Transfer Agreement for secondary schools; (ii) indicate commitment to participate in&#13;
National Management Information System (NMIS) and the National Student Assessment&#13;
System (NSAS); (iii) have prepared a satisfactory diagnosis of the provincial education sector&#13;
and a project proposal; (iv) demonstrate willingness to carry out reforms to improve&#13;
productivity and efficiency in the sector and commitment to implement the Action Plan based&#13;
on the recommendation of the Sector Management Productivity Study; and (v) have&#13;
significant need to improve coverage and quality as reflected by educational indicators.&#13;
Compared with those included in the first project2, the participating provinces of this&#13;
proposed Second Decentralization and Improvement of Secondary Education Project, could&#13;
be judged to have weaker institutional and financial capacity, and to require more preparation&#13;
time. Nevertheless, this second group of participating provinces is also more heterogeneous,&#13;
as it also includes the Province and the Municipality of Buenos Aires.&#13;
2.    With regard to other characteristics, the provinces are also quite distinct. They are&#13;
geographically disparate: Santa Cruz, for example, is in the extreme south, while Salta, and&#13;
Tucuman are in the northwest. Population density and the overall size of the secondary&#13;
school system also varies enormously, with the Province of Buenos Aires and the&#13;
Municipality of Buenos Aires having by far the largest number of enrollments and schools.&#13;
The Municipality of Buenos Aires is responsible for 203.407 secondary enrollments, for&#13;
example, compared to Santa Cruz with only 14,564. The provinces also differ with respect&#13;
to institutional capacity and poverty indicators. The Municipality of Buenos Aires and the&#13;
Province of Buenos Aires are among the most advanced in terms of institutional capacity, but&#13;
the Province of Buenos Aires, for example, also includes a large percentage of households&#13;
with unsatisfied basic needs. The attached profiles included in this annex provide additional&#13;
background information on each province.&#13;
BUENOS AIRES PROVINCE&#13;
1.    Buenos Aires is the largest province in Argentina with an area of 307,571 square&#13;
kilometers and a population of 12,594,324 in 1991. The province can be divided into two&#13;
areas: the metropolitan area ("Conurbano"), containing 63 percent of the population, and&#13;
administratively divided into 19 Departments, and the countryside which includes several&#13;
major municipalities.&#13;
2. Provinces included in the (First) Decentralization and Improvement of Secondary Education Project are: C6rdoba, La Pampa, Mendonza,&#13;
Missiones, Neuquen, Rio Negro and Santa Fe.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44 -                              ANNEX A&#13;
2.    Enrollment, Teachers and Schools. In 1991, 2,584,842 students were enrolled in&#13;
the school system, of which 32.5 percent were at the secondary level. The public subsector&#13;
accounted for 71 percent of total secondary education enrollment and 78 percent of total&#13;
secondary teachers. Table A. 1 below provides additional information.&#13;

Public                     598,939            49,162           1,065&#13;
Private                    240,102            13,925             792&#13;
Total                      839,041            63,087           1,857&#13;
3.    Quality and Efficiency Indicators. The transition rate from primary to secondary&#13;
education was as low as 54 percent in 1992. Furthermore, less than 30 percent of students&#13;
complete secondary school. Repetition and drop-out rates averaged 15 and 54 percent&#13;
respectively in 1993. The cumulative effect of repetition and drop-outs account for an&#13;
average loss of 69 percent of the students in every cohort. Repetition and drop-out rates are&#13;
especially marked during the first two years of secondary education. The student/teacher&#13;
ratio in public secondary education was 13.3 according to provincial data for 1993.&#13;
4.    Education Financing. From 1991 to 1993 the province's total revenues increased by&#13;
90 percent. Meanwhile, education spending increased by 43 percent. In 1992, education&#13;
spending was approximately 25 percent of total public spending. Lastly, in 1993, personnel&#13;
as a share of total education expenditures was 85 percent and per-student expenditure was&#13;
US$324.&#13;
CHACO&#13;
1.    Chaco, with an area of 99,633 square kilometers, had a population of 839,677 in&#13;
1991, highly concentrated in the urban areas. The province's economic crisis over the past&#13;
several years, has resulted in a strong migration to the provincial Capital region and to&#13;
neighboring provinces.&#13;
2.    Enrollment, Teachers and Schools. In 1993, 255,836 students were enrolled in the&#13;
school system, of which only 20 percent were at the secondary level. The public subsector&#13;
accounted for 91 percent of total secondary education enrollments and 92 percent of total&#13;
secondary teachers. Table A.2 below provides additional information.&#13;

3.    Quality and Efficiency Indicators. The transition rate from primary to secondary&#13;
education was 95 percent in 1992. Despite this very high transition rate from primary to&#13;
secondary, less than 30 percent of students complete secondary school. Repetition and drop-&#13;
out rates averaged 17 percent and 46 percent respectively in 1992. The cumulative effect of&#13;
repetition and drop-out accounts for an average loss of 63 percent of the students in every&#13;
cohort. Repetition and drop-out rates are especially marked during the first two years of&#13;
secondary education. The student/teacher ratio in public secondary education was 7.1&#13;
percent according to provincial data for 1993.&#13;
4.    Education Financing. From 1991 to 1993 total revenues of the province increased&#13;
by 57 percent. Meanwhile, education spending increased 61 percent. In 1993, education&#13;
spending was approximately 32 of total public spending. Lastly, personnel as a share of total&#13;
education expenditures was 96 percent, and the per-student expenditure was almost US$1,189&#13;
in 1993.&#13;
CORRIENTES&#13;
1.    Corrientes, with 795,594 inhabitants in 1991, has been losing population due to&#13;
migration to other provinces. With 88,886 square kilometers, Corrientes has its population&#13;
concentrated in urban areas (82 percent in 1991).&#13;
2.    Enrollment, Teachers and Schools. Education statistics broken down by public and&#13;
private subsector are not available for secondary education. In 1991, 195,107 students were&#13;
enrolled in the secondary school system, of which 48,749 (25 percent) were at the secondary&#13;
level. The total number of teachers reached 6,870 in 1993.&#13;
3.    Quality and Efficiency Indicators. The transition rate from primary to secondary&#13;
education was approximately 65 percent in 1992, lower than in many others provinces under&#13;
the project. Only about 22 percent of students complete secondary school. Repetition&#13;
averaged 16 percent in 1993 and the cumulative effect of repetition and drop-out account for&#13;
a loss of 75 percent of each student's cohort. Repetition and drop-outs are especially marked&#13;
during the first two years of secondary education. The student/teacher ratio in public&#13;
secondary education is 7.10, according to provincial data for 1993.&#13;
4.    Education Financing. From 1991 to 1993 the provinces total revenues increased by&#13;
45 percent. Meanwhile, education spending increased by 47 percent. In 1993, education&#13;
spending was nearly 24 percent of total public spending. Lastly, personnel as a share of total&#13;
education expenditures was almost 99 percent and the per-student expenditure in public&#13;
secondary education was US$718.&#13;
ENTRE RIOS&#13;
1.    Entre Rios, whose area is 78.781 square kilometers, is divided into 16 Departments.&#13;
In 1991 the province's population was 1,020,257, of which 77 percent lived in urban areas.&#13;
The population distribution is unequal, reaching 55 inhabitants per square kilometer in the&#13;
Capital region, compared with a provincial average of 13.&#13;

3.    Quality and Efficiency Indicators. The transition rate from primary to secondary&#13;
education was approximately 95 percent in 1992. Despite this very high transition rate from&#13;
primary to secondary, only about 12 percent of students complete the secondary level.&#13;
Repetition and drop-out rates averaged 9 and 47 percent respectively in 1993. The cumulative&#13;
effect of repetition and drop-outs account for an average loss of almost 57 percent of the&#13;
students in every cohort. Repetition and drop-out rates are especially marked during the first&#13;
two years of secondary education. The student/teacher ratio in public secondary education is&#13;
7.9, according to provincial data for 1993.&#13;
4.    Education Financing. From 1991 to 1993 total provincial revenues increased 74&#13;
percent. Meanwhile, education spending increased 69 percent. In 1993 education spending&#13;
was nearly 29 percent of total public spending. Lastly, personnel as a share of total&#13;
education expenditures was about 83 percent, and the per-student expenditure averaged&#13;
US$1,418.&#13;
BUENOS AIRES MUNICIPALITY&#13;
1.    The Municipality of Buenos Aires (MCBA), with an area of 200 square kilometers,&#13;
and a population of 2,958,829 in 1991 (9 percent of the total Argentine population), is the&#13;
second largest concentration of urban population in Argentina. The Federal Capital has a&#13;
relatively aged population, whose numbers have not increased since 1947.&#13;
2.    Enrollment, Teachers and Schools. In 1993, 625,403 students were enrolled in the&#13;
school system, of which 35 percent were at the secondary level. The city of Buenos Aires is&#13;
the region in which the private sector has the most important role in the provision of&#13;
secondary education. According to data from 1991, the public subsector accounted for 52&#13;
percent of total secondary education enrollment and less them a half of total secondary&#13;
teachers (49 percent), as shown in Table A.4 bellow.&#13;

3.     Quality and Efficiency Indicators. The completion rate in secondary education was&#13;
59 percent in 1991, one of the highest in the country, probably due to the weight of the&#13;
private enrollments at this level. Provisional data for 1993 indicate a repetition and drop-out&#13;
rates averaging 8 percent and 38 percent, respectively, for the whole level. The&#13;
student/teacher ratio in the public secondary education is 6.9 according to municipal data for&#13;
19933.&#13;
4.     Education Financing. From  1991 to 1993 the province's total revenues increased 81&#13;
percent. Meanwhile, education spending increased 189 percent. In 1993, education&#13;
spending was nearly 26 percent of total public spending. Lastly, personnel as a share of total&#13;
education expenditures was approximately 75 percent and the per-student expenditure in&#13;
public secondary education was US$1,423.&#13;
SALTA&#13;
1.     Salta, with 155,488 square kilometers, is divided into 23 Departments. In 1991 the&#13;
population was 866,771, most of which was concentrated in the urban areas. From 1980 to&#13;
1991 the province's population increased by 30.7 percent.&#13;
2.     Enrollment, Teachers and Schools. In 1993, 303.449 students were enrolled in the&#13;
school system, of which 27 percent were at the secondary level. The public subsector&#13;
accounted for 78 percent of total secondary education enrollment and 74 percent of total&#13;
secondary teachers. Table A.5 below provides additional information.&#13;

3. The Municipality of Buenos Aires had a very small secondary system of its own before the transfer and, in 1992, received about 500 former&#13;
national secondary schools. Given the magnitude of the transfer and the unreliability of the national information system at this time, the&#13;
efficiency and financial data summarized in paras. 3 and 4, are based on a preliminary survey undertaken with a sample of the transferred&#13;
secondary schools.&#13;

3.    Quality and Efficiency Indicators. Data from 1992 indicate a transition rate from&#13;
primary to secondary education of approximately 97 percent, one of the highest of the project&#13;
provinces. However, only about 21 percent of students complete secondary school.&#13;
Repetition and drop-out rates averaged 15 and 43 percent respectively in 1993. The&#13;
cumulative effect of repetition and drop-out account for an average loss of almost 58 percent&#13;
of the students in every cohort. Repetition and drop-out rates are especially marked during&#13;
the first two years of secondary education. The student-teacher ratio is 6.8 in public&#13;
secondary education, according to provincial data for 1993.&#13;
4.    Education Financing. From 1991 to 1993, total provincial revenues increased by 80&#13;
percent. Meanwhile, education spending increased 69 percent. In 1993, education spending&#13;
was nearly 22 percent of total public spending. Lastly, personnel as a share of total&#13;
education expenditures was more than 88 percent, and the per-student expenditure averaged&#13;

SANTA CRUZ&#13;
1.    Santa Cruz is the country's most southerly province with the exception of Tierra del&#13;
Fuego. With 243,943 square kilometers and a population of 159,839 in 1991, Santa Cruz is&#13;
the second largest province in terms of size, and the most sparsely populated. More than 50&#13;
percent of the province's population is concentrated in the capital, hence the average for the&#13;
rest of the province is as low as 0.1 inhabitant per square kilometer. Nevertheless, the&#13;
population has increased significantly over the last several years (29.4 percent from 1980 to&#13;
1991), due mainly to immigration from Chile and other provinces. More than 42 percent of&#13;
the Argentineans presently living in Santa Cruz were born elsewhere in the country.&#13;
2.    Enrollment, Teachers and Schools. In 1993, 49,966 students were enrolled in the&#13;
school system, of which 29 percent were at the secondary level. The public subsector&#13;
accounted for 89 percent of total secondary enrollments and 89 percent of total secondary&#13;
teachers. Table A.6 below provides additional information.&#13;

3.    Quality and Efficiency Indicators. The transition rate from primary to secondary&#13;
education was approximately 98 percent in 1992. Despite this very high transition rate from&#13;
primary to secondary, only about 35 percent of students complete secondary school. This loss&#13;
of 65 percent of students of each cohort is due to repetition and drop-outs which in 1993&#13;
averaged 16 percent and 75 percent, respectively, for the whole level. Repetition and drop-&#13;
out rates are especially marked during the first two years of secondary education. The&#13;
student/teacher ratio is 4.98 in the public school system as a whole, according to provincial&#13;
data from 1993. There are no available data on student/teacher ratios for secondary&#13;
education.&#13;
4.    Education Fmancing. From 1991 to 1993 the province's total revenues increased by&#13;
101 percent. Meanwhile, education spending increased 70 percent. In 1993, education&#13;
spending was 23 percent of total public spending. Lastly, personnel as a share of total&#13;
education expenditures was approximately 74 percent and the per-student expenditure in&#13;
public secondary education averaged US$1,958.&#13;
TUCUMAN&#13;
1.    Tucuman, with a population of 1,142,105 in 1991 and an area of 22,524 square&#13;
kilometers, is one of the smallest Argentinean provinces. Tucuman also has one of the&#13;
highest population densities of Argentina. The province is divided into 17 Departments.&#13;

enrolled in the school system, of which 58,486 (16 percent) were at the secondary level.&#13;
The total number of schools and teachers at the secondary level were 183 and 7,366&#13;
respectively, in 1993.&#13;
3.    Quality and Efficiency Indicators. Repetition and drop-out rates averaged 9 and 44&#13;
percent respectively in 1993. The cumulative effect of repetition and drop-outs account for an&#13;
average loss of 53 percent of students in every cohort. Drop-out and repetition are especially&#13;
significant during the first two years of secondary education. There are no data regarding&#13;
the student/teacher ratio.&#13;
4.    Education Fmancing. From 1991 to 1993 total revenues of the province increased&#13;
51 percent. Meanwhile, education spending increased 69 percent during the same period. In&#13;
1993, education spending was nearly 28 percent of total public spending. Lastly, personnel&#13;
expenditures as a share of total education spending was almost 90 percent, and the per-&#13;
student expenditure on public secondary education averaged US$376.&#13;

ANNEX B: SECONDARY EDUCATION EFFICIENCY '&#13;
I. The very poor satistical tracking systems at both the national and provincial levels in Argentina have resulted in&#13;
a dearth of reliable educational statistics. The provinces under consideration tend to be particularly weak in this&#13;
respect. This annex presents available date from both national and provincial sources. In addition, the National&#13;
Ministrq of Education haa recently completed a comprehensive educational census. New data from the census&#13;
should be available by December 1995.&#13;

ANNEX C&#13;
ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM&#13;
1.    The 24 Provincial Ministries of Education (PMEs) are the principal providers of&#13;
secondary education in Argentina. The PMEs are accountable to each Provincial Governor,&#13;
and control 61 % of all secondary schools with enrollments totalling 1,550,824. Provinces&#13;
vary with regard to internal organizational structures, although at the highest level they have&#13;
a minister, secretary, subsecretary and directors who are in charge of formulating and&#13;
implementing provincial educational policy. Some provinces have an internal network of&#13;
subprovincial administrative units, such as regional offices, while others are more&#13;
centralized. Besides overseeing the day-to-day administration of schools, the PMEs have the&#13;
following financial and administrative responsibilities: (a) program supervision; (b) planning&#13;
and budgeting; (c) school maintenance and construction; (d) provision of educational&#13;
materials; (e) hiring and dismissal of teachers; and (c) teacher training. Prior to the&#13;
enactment of the Federal Education Law (FEL) in 1993, several provinces maintained&#13;
essentially dual educational administrations, whereby the Provincial Ministries of Education&#13;
were responsible for secondary education, while Provincial Councils of Culture and&#13;
Education (PCCE) ran the more extensive primary system. The FEL redefined the roles of&#13;
both the Federal and Provincial Councils of Culture and Education away from direct&#13;
administrative responsibilities towards more advisory functions, while confirming the primary&#13;
administrative responsibility of the PMEs.&#13;
2.          The National Ministry of Culture and Education (NMCE) no longer has direct&#13;
administrative responsibility for secondary schools, following their transfer to the provinces&#13;
in 1992. NMCE's primary functions include evaluating and monitoring the educational&#13;
system, confirming the consistency and quality of educational programs while ensuring&#13;
adherence to national goals and policies, providing financial and technical assistance to&#13;
ensure quality education among the neediest social groups, setting requirements and&#13;
conditions for recognizing national and international degrees, and operating a federal&#13;
management information system. NMCE's internal structure is divided into four main&#13;
secretariats: (i) Operations and Technical Affairs; (ii) Cultural Affairs; (iii) University&#13;
Affairs; and (iv) Educational Programming and Evaluation. This last will have the overall&#13;
responsibility for implementation and supervision of the proposed project. Under the&#13;
Secretariat of Educational Programming and Evaluation, there are three subsecretariats that&#13;
will be more directly involved in implementing the project: (i) subsecretariat of Programming&#13;
and Education Management (SUPEM), where the National Project Coordination Unit&#13;
(NPCU) is established; (ii) the Subsecretariat of Education Quality Evaluation, responsible&#13;
for the National Student Assessment System and the National Management Information&#13;
System; and (iii) the Subsecretariat of Program Evaluation.&#13;
3.    Coordination between NMCE and the PMEs is carried out by the Federal Council on&#13;
Cultura and Education (CFCE). The CFCE's functions and responsibilities were defined by&#13;
the Federal Education Law (1993). Among its most important functions is the establishment&#13;
of national policies and programs to promote cultural and educational development, the&#13;
setting of priorities for the sector, proposals for modifications to the legal framework&#13;
regulating the sector's activities, and establishment of the minimum contents of each&#13;
educational cycle. The Minister of NMCE presides over the CFCE.&#13;

ANNEX C&#13;
Structure of the Education Sector&#13;
4.    In the pre-FEL education structure, pre-school education was mandatory only in some&#13;
provinces. Primary education consisted of a 7-year obligatory cycle that began at the age of&#13;
six. This was followed by a secondary cycle of five or six years, depending on the track&#13;
chosen by the student: the baccalaureate track emphasized a general broad-based education;&#13;
the commercial track, which had a professional orientation, lasted 5 years. The technical-&#13;
vocational track prepared students for immediate employment in the labor market through&#13;
studies in technical, agricultural, artistic, and other specializations lasted 6 years.&#13;
Additionally, postsecondary education was divided into three subsystems: public and private&#13;
universities; research institutions; and non-university tertiary institutions. Table C. 1 below&#13;
delineates the old and new educational structures.&#13;

5.    The post-FEL educational structure represents a significant break with the old pattern.&#13;
Pre-school education will be compulsory for one year starting at age five, in addition to a&#13;
new 9- year General Basic Education cycle, which would begin immediately after pre-school,&#13;
at age six. After completion of General Education, students will enter secondary education&#13;
comprised of a polymodal cycle with a duration of 3 years and a curricular content that&#13;
emphasizes integrated knowledge of four cluster areas (humanistic, social, scientific, and&#13;
technical).&#13;

-91-                                    ANNEX E&#13;
ESTIMATES OF BENEFITS ARISING FROM THE PROJECT&#13;
1.   The project is expected to produce substantial savings and economic benefits, both&#13;
through greater efficiency resulting from investments in institutional strengthening, and from&#13;
the higher earnings of students who complete that secondary level''. As a result of quality-&#13;
improvement activities supported by the project, greater numbers of students will complete&#13;
the secondary level than would do so in the absence of the project. The readily-quantifiable,&#13;
monetary benefits the project can be expected to produce fall into four categories:&#13;
(a)   Savings from reduced repetition: If improved educational quality makes it possible for&#13;
students to learn as much or more without repeating, fewer student places will be&#13;
needed to accommodate the same number of entering students and to produce the same&#13;
number of secondary school completers.&#13;
(b)   Economic benefits as more students complete the secondary cycle: Whereas many&#13;
students now drop out of secondary school without completing the cycle, improved&#13;
quality is expected to result in more of each cohort completing their secondary&#13;
schooling. The incremental earnings of completers versus non-completers, for those&#13;
students who otherwise would have dropped out, constitutes an economic benefit in&#13;
standard benefit-cost terms.&#13;
(c)   Savings from improved staff-student ratios; greater productivity: Reductions in excess&#13;
staff and reasonable improvements in student:teacher ratios will reduce personnel costs.&#13;
(d)   Savings from improved efficiency of administrative operations: Improvements in&#13;
administrative operations will make it possible to reduce some administrative costs.&#13;
2.   The project will affect eight jurisdictions in all, but investments in the Province of&#13;
Buenos Aires are quite limited and are intended to lay the groundwork for a subsequent free-&#13;
standing project for that large province. No calculations of benefits for the Province of&#13;
Buenos Aires are included in the analyses below. Available data permit rough but reasonable&#13;
estimates of some of the benefits that would accrue to the seven remaining provinces. The&#13;
following paragraphs present approximations of potential benefits based upon reasonable or&#13;
even conservative assumptions.&#13;
3.   Reduced Repetition. As Annex Table B. 12 shows, repetition rates vary from slightly&#13;
over 9 percent per year in Tucuman and Entre Rios to 16 and 17 percent in Corrientes and&#13;
Chaco, respectively. The weighted average of repetition in the seven provinces is&#13;
approximately 14 percent. If total secondary enrollment in the seven provinces was 527,742&#13;
in 1993 (Annex Table B.7) this implies that 73,425 student places were occupied by repeaters&#13;
in 1993.&#13;
1/   Positive rates of return to investment in education could also be considered one of the benefits of the project. Data on rates of&#13;
return to investment in secondary education are available for the Greater Buenos Aires. A Study from the Fundaci6n de Investigaciones&#13;
Economicas Latinoamericanas (FEEL), reports a rate of return of about 11.2 to completed secondary education, as compared with incomplet&#13;
secondary education. Similar data are repoiled by the INDEC Permanent Household Survey.&#13;

4.    Table E.3 shows secondary student unit costs in 1993. Using an average cost of&#13;
A$998 per secondary student per year, this implies that repetition now costs over A$73&#13;
million per year. It would be unrealistic to assume that the project's quality-improvement&#13;
investments would eliminate repetition completely. Once the quality reforms are in operation&#13;
and have had an effect on a full cohort of secondary students, repetition may be assumed to&#13;
reduced from 13.4 to about 10 percent per year-'. This would represent an aggregate saving&#13;
of A$20,640,000 per year in the seven provinces, begining in the third year of the project.&#13;

5.    Reduced Dropouts  Economic benefits that result from  more students completing the&#13;
secondary cycle rather than dropping out are the additional earnings that these students&#13;
receive, over and above the earnings of those who do not complete. Students drop out for a&#13;
number of reasons, including social and economic pressures over which the education system&#13;
has no control. An important reason, however, is that low quality of education fails to&#13;
enable students to keep up and learn, and eventually does not seem worthwhile. Annex&#13;
Annex Table B. 10 shows dropout rates by province. The Municipality of Buenos Aires has&#13;
2/This assumnption was based in UNESCO's data, described in 'State of Education in LAC, 1980-1987'. The over-all repetition rates per&#13;
year were 8 percent in Uruguay and Mexico, 12 percent in Columbia, Panama and Peru and range up to 15 and 18 percent in Nicaragua&#13;
and Brazil, respectively. Considering that Argentina is a relatively advanced country, the assuwmption was that the quality improvement&#13;
measures financed by the project will cause the repetition rate to decline from over 13 percent to 10 percent.&#13;

rates in excess of 40 percent. The seven provinces for which benefits are being calculated&#13;
have a weighted average of 39 percent dropouts during the four-year secondary cycle.&#13;
6.    Economic benefits arise from reducing dropouts because the students who now&#13;
complete the secondary cycle earn more. Table E.4 shows data from the INDEC Permanent&#13;
Household Survey on the monthly salary differentials between those who have incomplete&#13;
and complete secondary education level. In calculating the annual salary difference, it is&#13;
important to remember that in Argentina, all workers receive a Christmas bonus or&#13;
"aguinaldo" equal to one month's pay. Multiplying the un-weighted average salary gain by&#13;
13 months gives an annualized increase of A$2,670.&#13;

8.    Improved Staff-Student Ratios Student-teacher ratios in Argentina generally, and in the&#13;
seven provinces included in the project, are very low in comparison with other countries in&#13;
the region. Table D.25 shows staff-to-student ratios in the four provinces for which such&#13;
data exist.&#13;

9.   The causes of very low student-teacher ratios include employment of teachers in&#13;
activities outside the education sector (some teaching in institutions such as police academies&#13;
and some in non-teaching positions) even though they are still counted as teachers and paid&#13;
from the education budget; non-observance of norms regarding class size; continued&#13;
employment of teachers who are on permanent medical disability leave; use of teaching staff&#13;
for record-keeping, counselling and disciplinary functions (preceptors); as well as problems&#13;
that are difficult to overcome, such as widely-dispersed rural schools serving very small&#13;
student populations. The seven provinces have indicated their commitment to improve&#13;
efficiency in use of teaching staff and a number have taken steps to eliminate some of the&#13;
problems mentioned above. Management studies will be carried out, as a condition of the&#13;
loan, to determine ways of improving the utilization of teaching and administrative staff.&#13;
The following simple calculations provide a very approximate indicator of possible orders of&#13;
magnitude (in millions of Argentine pesos) if student-teacher ratios were increased from the&#13;
current 7.1 to attain levels of 8, 9, 10 or 12 students per teacher. An improved 8:1 student-&#13;
teacher ratio could be achieved by only the simplest changes in existing regulations.&#13;
Assuming that an improvement to 9:1 -- still low by international standards -- could be&#13;
achieved as a result of efficiency-enhancing measures financed by the project, this change&#13;
could produce a savings of A$350 million per year.&#13;
Public education spending 1993, 7 provinces (millions)  A$1,952&#13;
Estimated salary budgets (85% of recurrent expenditure) A$1,659&#13;
Annual savings if Tchr/Student ratio = 8:1 (millions)   A$ 187&#13;
Annual savings if Tchr/Student ratio = 9:1 (millions)  A$ 350&#13;
Annual savings of Tchr/Student ratio = 10:1 (million)  A$ 481&#13;
Annual savings of Tchr/Student ratio = 12:1 (million)  A$ 677&#13;
10. More Efficient Administration Savings from more-efficient administrative operations&#13;
will come about as a result of reductions in staff made possible by better organization and&#13;
management of provincial education ministries, introduction of computers that will reduce&#13;
needs for clerks and record-keepers and, other savings. The following calculations indicate&#13;
possible orders of magnitude of savings that will result from the project. On the basis of&#13;
data from provinces reporting, administrative expenses represent approximately 2.7 percent&#13;
of public spending in the sector. On this basis total administrative expenditures for education&#13;

- 95 -                          ANNEX E&#13;
in the seven provinces are A$52.7 million pesos. Assuming that savings in administrative&#13;
expenditures (apart from the above-referenced improvements in student-teacher ratios) would&#13;
be between 5% to 10%, the estimated savings would be:&#13;
5% of administrative expenditures (millions) A$2.65&#13;
10% of administrative expenditures (millions) A$5.30&#13;
11. The estimated savings and benefits presented above are monetary benefits; they do not&#13;
take into account the effects of one of the most important outcome of the project, which&#13;
would be better quality and improved learning for all students, not just those who would have&#13;
repeated or dropped out. Better-prepared school leavers would have higher employment&#13;
rates and higher productivity, but no attempt is made here to quantify this category of&#13;
benefits. Potential annual benefits are considered only after the year 2000, once the project&#13;
is in operation and its effects can be felt. This results in total benefits as follows (in millions&#13;
of Argentine pesos):&#13;
(a) Reduction in repetition from 13.1 % to 10%      A$20.6&#13;
(b) Incremental earnings from additional completers    17.2&#13;
(c) Student-teacher ratio of (9:1)                   350.0&#13;
(d) Five percent reduction in administrative costs    2.7&#13;
Estimate of potential benefits    A$442.0&#13;

            Argentina - Decentralization and
            Improvement of Secondary Education and Polymodal Education
            Development Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Decentralization
            and Improvement of Secondary Education and Polymodal
            Education Development Project are to: 1) strengthen
            institutional capacity in the Provincial Ministries of
            Education (PMEs) under a decentralized framework; 2)
            increase the quality and efficiency of secondary education
            in the selected PMEs; and 3) increase/improve physical
            capacity to serve the secondary school-aged population more
            effectively. The project consists of the three major
            components. The first component is institutional
