&amp;#12;&#13;
A. STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE&#13;
&#13;
1.Countryand Sector Background&#13;
&#13;
1.      Tajikistan is the poorest o fthe former Soviet republics and one o f the poorest countries in&#13;
the world. Three quarters o f its 6.8 million people live in rural areas where they are mainly&#13;
engaged in agriculture, with most o f them owning small numbers o f livestock that provide&#13;
immediate cash for pressing needs as well as animal protein. It i s estimated that seventy percent&#13;
of the approximately 2.3 million chicken inthe country i s raised by such rural households intheir&#13;
backyards. Tajikistan has, so far, not had any recorded outbreaks o f highly pathogenic avian flu&#13;
(HPAIH5N1). However, cases o f AI have been reported in China, Kazakhstan, Russia, Turkey,&#13;
Iraq, India, and Afghanistan. There i s a risk o f an H5N1 outbreak among poultry in Tajikistan&#13;
through waterfowl migration and/or the growing cross-border trade. The Government recently&#13;
initiated random surveillance in the wetland habitats o f waterfowl and imposed some poultry&#13;
import restrictions. It has also drafted a Comprehensive Action Plan for Avian Influenza. Several&#13;
donors (principally WHO, UNICEF and FAO) are currently supporting the Government's HPAI&#13;
strategy by providing technical assistance in refining the Comprehensive Action Plan for AI, as&#13;
well as conducting some rapid situation assessments.&#13;
&#13;
2.      However, critical needs still remain inthe areas o f institutional strengthening to enhance&#13;
preparedness planning and coordination, greater public awareness, surveillance and diagnostics,&#13;
containment, and the health care system's response capacity.         Accordingly, the Government&#13;
requested financial assistance from the World Bank for its efforts on February 23, 2006.&#13;
Tajikistan meets the eligibility criteria for financing under the Global Program for Avian&#13;
Influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response (GPAI) as a country at&#13;
risk with no outbreak, with Government commitment and appropriate plan of early detection&#13;
and rapid response, including appropriate implementation and monitoring arrangements that&#13;
the international agencies and donor community, including the Bank, can support.'&#13;
&#13;
2. Rationalefor BankInvolvement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.      Globally, the World Bank has been playing a critical role inrallying international support&#13;
to combat the threat posed by AI and inpreparing for a possible humanpandemic. Tajikistan has&#13;
particularly weak capacity to deal with this threat, a threat that could potentially impose a severe&#13;
burden o f disease, loss o f productivity and livelihoods on the country, thus rolling back some o f&#13;
its most recent economic gains. An AI outbreak in the country would also undermine the efforts&#13;
to limit the global spread o f HPAI. In Tajikistan, World Bank support will: (i)leverage its&#13;
resources to galvanize a coalition o f other agencies to the cause; (ii)bring to bear the Bank's&#13;
global experience incombating similar scourges around the world (e.g. HIV/AIDS); (iii)      share its&#13;
rich experience inmulti-sectoral approaches, the kmdthat combating AI requires; (iv) ensure that&#13;
this response is in harmony with existing or planned World Bank funded programs (and other&#13;
donor-funded programs), particularly in health and agriculture, for maximum synergy; and (v)&#13;
provide badly needed financial resources for minimum investments needed to combat this threat&#13;
effectively.&#13;

B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
1.ProjectDevelopmentObjectiveandKeyIndicators&#13;
&#13;
4.       The project development objective i s to minimize the threat HPAI infection and other&#13;
zoonoses pose to humans and poultry in Tajikistan, and to prepare for, control and respond to&#13;
influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies in humans. The project will focus&#13;
on three main areas: (i)   preparedness and planning, (ii)&#13;
                                                         prevention through public awareness and&#13;
surveillance, and (iii) response and containment incase o f an outbreak.&#13;
5.       K e y indicators include: (i) effective and inter-sectoral surveillance system inplace for&#13;
                                     an&#13;
HPAIand other zoonoses inboth animals and humans; (ii)       institutional mechanisms in place for&#13;
the effective implementation o f an integrated and multi-sectoral contingency plan for endemic&#13;
preparedness, and (iii)   contained outbreaks in poultry with no demonstrated transmission from&#13;
birdsto humans.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
6.       As described in OP 8.50 for Emergency Recovery Assistance, in addition to emergency&#13;
assistance, the Bank may support operations for prevention and mitigation in countries prone to&#13;
specific types o f emergencies. Such operations could assist in: (a) developing a national strategy,&#13;
(b) establishing an adequate institutional and regulatory framework, (c) carrying out studies o f&#13;
vulnerability and risk assessment, (d) reinforcing vulnerable structures, and (e) acquiring hazard-&#13;
reduction technology. Given the threat posed by HPAIto the economic and social fabric o f the&#13;
country, as well as to the health o f the population because o f the risk o f an influenza pandemic,&#13;
the Project will be financed through an Emergency Recovery IDA Grant o f US$5.0 million. The&#13;
project falls under the aegs o f the GPAI discussed by the Board on January 12, 2006. It will,&#13;
therefore, be approved under streamlined, horizontal APL procedures.&#13;
&#13;
7.        Project activities are grouped into four components, namely: (i) Awareness and&#13;
                                                                              Public&#13;
Information; (ii)Animal Health; (iii)Human Health; and (iv) Implementation Support and&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
 8.       Component I - Public Awareness and Information (US$l.O million IDA; US$0.2&#13;
million UNICEF). This component supports the development o f a communication program&#13;
 aimed at minimizing the risk o f an avian influenza outbreak and its spread, by ensuring that&#13;
 citizens understand the threat, and are aware o f AI symptoms, with a view to influencing their&#13;
behaviors in order to protect themselves and their communities. The component will include (i)&#13;
policy advocacy to heighten AI awareness among decision makers, and support to the&#13;
 government for crisis communication management; (ii)       public education through mass media;&#13;
 and (iii)social mobilization through community/school-based targeted interventions. Specific&#13;
 activities to be financed under the component include: (i)opinion research and information&#13;
 campaigns, e.g. air-time and advertising space in mass-media outlets, reproduction and&#13;
 distribution o f informational materials; (ii) training, seminars, workshops for stakeholders -&#13;
 Government staff involved inthe project, teachers, health workers, community members, media,&#13;
 etc.&#13;
&#13;
 9.       Component 11- Animal Health (US$ 1.9 million IDA; US$l.l million AHIF). This&#13;
 component provides support for prevention, control and total eradication o f HPAI through: (i)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
enhancing animal health planning and coordination capability for HPAI prevention; (ii)&#13;
strengthening field disease surveillance and laboratory diagnostic capacity; and (iii)strengthening&#13;
HPAIoutbreak containment plans, including the establishment of a compensation fund. Specific&#13;
activities to be financed under the component include: (i)recruitment o f domestic and&#13;
international consultants to - (a) review the legal and regulatory framework with a view to&#13;
strengthening it in order to facilitate effective AI surveillance and outbreak containment, (b)&#13;
elaborate and distribute standard operating procedures, (c) conduct training; etc. (iii)  purchase&#13;
and installation o f laboratory equipment, purchase of laboratory reagents, vehicles, equipment for&#13;
safe and sanitary poultry culling, including sprayers and protective gear, equipment for&#13;
communication and data management, etc.;             (iv) limited civil works for laboratory&#13;
reconfiguratiodrehabilitation; (v) operating costs; and (vi) a compensation fund for possible&#13;
Government-mandated culling.&#13;
&#13;
10.      Component111Human Health (US$ 1.8 million IDA; US$O.l million WHO; US$0.4&#13;
                                           -&#13;
million AHIF). This component provides support for reduction of the impact o f a pandemic&#13;
influenza virus through: (i)    enhancing public health program planning and coordination; (ii)&#13;
strengthening o f national public health surveillance systems; and (iii) strengthening health care&#13;
system's response capacity. Similar to Component I1 above, specific activities to be financed&#13;
under this component include consultants, laboratory equipment and reagents, vehicles, and&#13;
limited civil works for reconfiguratiodrehabilitation of laboratory and hospital space for AI&#13;
diagnosis and patient treatment. In addition, this component would finance a strategic supply of&#13;
drugs andvaccines, andmedical equipment.&#13;
&#13;
11.      Component I V Implementation Support and Monitoring and Evaluation             - (US$ 0.3&#13;
million IDA) - this component supports the coordination and management of the planned&#13;
activities, including arrangements for financial management and procurement. It also supports&#13;
continuous monitoring of project implementation, including operational audits of the&#13;
Compensation Fund. It further supports overall annual project audits, as well as periodic surveys&#13;
onproject outcome indicators.&#13;
&#13;
 12.     Emergency Imports     - In case of a declared influenza pandemic, some of the items in&#13;
Components I1and I11above would be procured under emergency procedures. These imports are&#13;
likely to include: (i) protective clothing and gear; (ii)&#13;
                                                        pharmaceuticals and vaccines, (iii)medical&#13;
and veterinary supplies and equipment, (iv) communication equipment and supplies; and (v) food&#13;
and water containers. The Project would finance these emergency imports under a well-defined&#13;
preparedness and response program to be prepared as part o f project implementation.&#13;
Disbursement under these emergency procedures would only be permitted when a national&#13;
emergency on avian influenza has been declared by the Government and a well-defined&#13;
emergency recovery program, satisfactory to the Association, has been adopted by the&#13;
Government.&#13;
&#13;
C.       IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
1. InstitutionalandImplementationArrangements&#13;
[For details,pleasego toAppendix 41&#13;
&#13;
 13.     Overall Policy Formulation and Oversight. A National Steering Committee (NSC) will&#13;
be established under the leadership o f a DeputyPrimeMinisterto provide overall policy direction&#13;
and implementation guidance. NSC members will consist o f representatives from Ministry of&#13;
Health (MOH), Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), Ministry o f Finance (MOF), Ministry o f&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Emergency Situations and Civic Defense (MOESCD), Aid Coordination Unit, Academy o f&#13;
Science, Academy o f Agncultural Sciences, and other concerned line agencies.&#13;
&#13;
14.      Fiduciary Management and Project Monitoring.           The project will use an already&#13;
existing Project Management Unit, which i s currently managmg the "Rural Infrastructure&#13;
Rehabilitation and the "Community Agriculture and Watershed Management" Projects. The&#13;
PMU will act as a secretariat to the NSC as well as coordinate and facilitate project&#13;
implementation. The P M U already has a Director, a Procurement Specialist, and a Financial&#13;
Management Specialist, and support staff (secretaries, drivers, etc.). A CommunicationSpecialist&#13;
and a Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist will be added to the team.          Given the demands&#13;
imposed by the emergency nature o f the operation (with fiont-loaded procurement and&#13;
disbursement), as well as the presence o f a compensation fund, this PMU staff strength will be&#13;
augmented with a limited-tern Procurement Consultant for the initial months o f project&#13;
implementation. An Assistant to the ChiefAccountant will also be recruited and shall stay on the&#13;
team for the entire duration o f project implementation, as well as a Compensation Fund&#13;
Administrator.&#13;
&#13;
15.      Day-to-day Project Implementation. Day-to-day implementation will be carried out by&#13;
various Government Agencies, with support from Specialized International Organizations. Each&#13;
Government agency will have a focal point who will lead the team responsible for all project&#13;
activities implementedby that agency.&#13;
&#13;
(0   Government Agencies&#13;
&#13;
 16.     The Public Awareness and Information Component cuts across multiple agencies, with&#13;
some aspects of it falling under MOH, other aspects under the State Veterinary Department, with&#13;
yet other aspects (e.g. policy advocacy to heighten AI awareness among decision makers and&#13;
support to the government for crisis communication management) not falling under any one&#13;
particular agency. Inorder to avoid overlaps and ensure a cohesive communication strategy, this&#13;
component will be overseen by a Communication Specialist inthe Project ManagementUnit who&#13;
will be responsible for its overall coordinationas well as for acting as the key spokesperson on all&#13;
AI issues incase o fa crisis.&#13;
&#13;
 17.     The Animal Health Component will be implemented by: (i) State Veterinary&#13;
                                                                              the&#13;
Department which will be responsible for planning and coordination o f the animal aspects of the&#13;
AI response, as well as for poultry surveillance and outbreak containment; (ii) Institute of&#13;
                                                                                     the&#13;
Zoology and Parasitology with be responsible for wild bird surveillance; and (iii) Foot and&#13;
                                                                                       the&#13;
Mouth Disease Institute (FMDI)will be responsible for conducting laboratory diagnostics.&#13;
&#13;
 18.     The Human Health Component will be implemented by: (i)MOH's Sanitary and&#13;
Epidemiological Surveillance Department for matters related to planning and coordination, field&#13;
 surveillance, and laboratory diagnostics; and (ii)&#13;
                                                 MOH's Medical ServicesDepartment which will&#13;
 also participate in planning and coordination, in addition to being responsible for treatment&#13;
response.&#13;
&#13;
 19.     In case o f declared influenza pandemic, MOESCD would, by law, take charge for&#13;
 coordinating all emergency response activities. Consequently, MOESCD will closely work with&#13;
 other agencies participating in the project to ensure an effective response in case o f an&#13;
 emergency.&#13;
&#13;
 (ii) Specialized International Organizations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20.     First, this i s an Emergency project that will be implemented at a rapid pace in order to&#13;
pre-empt the AI threat that has already been cited inneighboring countries. Second, the project i s&#13;
dealing with a threat that i s new to the country, where there i s limited past experience on how to&#13;
deal with it. Third, the multiple agencies involved in the project have limited planning and&#13;
implementation capacity.       Consequently, the project will work very closely with technical&#13;
agencies that have a well-established experience in dealing with similar disease outbreaks&#13;
elsewhere. In particular, within the UN family, UNICEF has the global mandate for Public&#13;
Awareness/Communication regarding AI, as does WHO regarding the human health dimensions&#13;
o f AI, and FA0 regarding animal health dimensions. As noted earlier, these three agencies are&#13;
already assisting Government inrefining its Preparedness Plan.&#13;
&#13;
21.      It i s anticipated that these technical agencies will continue to offer this support during&#13;
project implementation. Specifically, it i s envisaged that UNICEF will enter into contract with&#13;
the Government to assist with the implementation o f the Communication Component. UNICEF&#13;
has successfully implemented similar communication programs inTajikistan and, on the issue o f&#13;
AI, has shown readiness to help the Government design and implement a communication&#13;
program addressed to specific target audiences (veterinarians, farmers, health workers, decision-&#13;
makers, etc.) as well as to the public at large. Similarly it is expected that WHO will enter into&#13;
contract with the Government to assist with the implementation o f the Technical Assistance&#13;
aspects o fthe Human Health component.&#13;
&#13;
22.      The capacity of the two UNagencies to provide this kind o f assistance has been assessed&#13;
and found satisfactory. Moreover, these two agencies will co-finance the Public Awareness and&#13;
Information Component (UNICEF) and the Human Health Component (WHO), largely through&#13;
absorbing the overhead costs associated with managing these activities, but also financing some&#13;
surveys and some of the capacity building activities.            The agency for assisting in the&#13;
implementation o f the Animal Health component will be identified during the project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
&#13;
23.      Inter-Agency Coordination Framework. In order to foster collaboration among the&#13;
various Government agencies involved inproject implementation, there shall be an Inter-Agency&#13;
Working Group consisting o f all the Focal Persons at each implementing agency, as well as&#13;
representatives o f the International Technical Agencies, the Director of the PMU, and&#13;
representatives o f other agencies or individuals as the PMU, in consultation with the IDA, shall&#13;
 from time to time decide. The purpose o f such a forum is to create an opportunity for information&#13;
 sharing to ensure synergy among the various components. This Inter-Agency Working Group&#13;
will meet at least once a month, or at such other greater frequency depending upon the need,&#13;
particularly in the early months o f the project, in order to ensure effective collaboration. It will&#13;
be chaired by the PMUDirector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 2. MonitoringandEvaluation of Outcomes/Results&#13;
 [For details,please go toAppendix 21&#13;
&#13;
 24.     A detailed results framework and the associated arrangements for monitoring are&#13;
 presented in Appendix 2. These arrangements are broadly consistent with GPAI standards and&#13;
 expectations. Overall responsibility for monitoring and evaluation will be with the Monitoring&#13;
 and Evaluation Specialist in the PMU. This expert will consolidate information provided by the&#13;
 different implementing agencies highlighted above. The monitoring will cover physical&#13;
 implementation progress, use o f project finds, project outputs, and project outcomes. This will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
involve quantitative and qualitative information gathered from project files, progress reports from&#13;
implementing agencies, as well as periodic surveys.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3. Sustainability&#13;
&#13;
25.      A series of measures have been undertaken to ensure institutional, technical, and fiscal&#13;
sustainability of project activities and outcomes beyond the implementation phase. First, the&#13;
project is firmly anchored in the country's national preparedness plan for avian influenza, and&#13;
project preparation was carried out under the aegs o f the Government's inter-agency working&#13;
group for avian influenza, in order to ensure maximum ownership. Second, project investments&#13;
and project activities have benefits that go beyond avian influenza, thanks to the multi-disease&#13;
nature o f the surveillance and diagnostic activities, and the comprehensiveness (i.e. multi-disease&#13;
nature) o f the habit transforming, public awareness message. Consequently, there i s an abiding&#13;
interest by the various stakeholders to safeguard these investments and sustain these activities.&#13;
Third, except for some aspects of the public awareness component (e.g. policy advocacy), all&#13;
other project activities will be streamlined into the existing government agencies as part of their&#13;
regular mandates, thus avoiding the creation o fnew unsustainable structures (note that the PMU's&#13;
role i s largely fiduciary, a function that lapses after the project implementation phase).         The&#13;
capacity o f these agencies is being strengthened to continue the surveillance, diagnostics and&#13;
treatment beyond project implementation as described in Appendix 3a. Fourth, whereas there&#13;
will be an initial high upfront investment in public awareness, laboratory equipment, etc.., the&#13;
sustaining costs are expected to be l o w and fiscally manageable by targeting the high risk areas&#13;
(resting sites o f migratory birds, border posts due to risks from cross-border trade, etc...) and&#13;
usingexisting staff. Thus, overall, the project's sustainability at appraisal i srated"likely".&#13;

26.      Corruption i s acknowledged as a major issue inthe public sector, and the project will be&#13;
implemented in an environment o f highperceived corruption. Inaddition to the risk mitigation&#13;
measures highlighted below, the Project will place strong emphasis on disclosure and&#13;
transparency and on strengthened complaint handling mechanisms coupled with specific remedial&#13;
measures. A summary o f measures i s provided below inthe context o f fiduciary risk mitigation.&#13;
The corollary benefits regarding good governance are self-evident. The following measures are&#13;
incorporated inproject design to minimize the possiblemisuse o f funds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0    Ex-ante controls.      Appropriate ex-ante internal controls in the poultry culling and&#13;
         compensation program (outlined in Annexes 3b and 7) will be implemented before any&#13;
         disbursement o f IDA resources fi-omthe Compensation Fund, and ex-ante checks will be&#13;
         carried out before any compensation payments are made.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
    e  Annual operational reviews.         To supplement the annual project audit, an annual&#13;
       operational review will be carried out by external reviewers, acceptable to IDA, who will&#13;
       review the internal control framework and procedures, especially for the Compensation&#13;
       Fund, and the inventories o f drugs, vaccines, medical and veterinary equipment, and&#13;
       other sensitive andor expensive assets.&#13;
    e  Prior review of procurement. Project procurement will be subject to prior-review in&#13;
       accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines and with threshold levels indicatedin&#13;
       Annex 6. Intensive and close supervision including majority of the contracts will be&#13;
       conducted by the Bank.&#13;
    e   Post review ofprocurement. One o f five contracts will be post reviewed.&#13;
    0   Complaint mechanisms. A strengthened complaint handling mechanism, especially for&#13;
       the Compensation Fund, will be put in place to handle complaints regarding alleged&#13;
       misuse o f funds. All complaints by bidders will be diligently addressed and monitored in&#13;
        consultation with the RPMoffice.&#13;
    e   Transparency and public information.         Information about project activities will be&#13;
        continually posted on a Project website. All publications o f advertisement and contracts&#13;
        includingresults o f awards will be monitored as per the Bank Procurement Guidelines.&#13;
    e   Training: Project launch workshop and intensive procurement training for the involved&#13;
        ministries staff will be conducted periodically&#13;
    0  Intensive supervision by IDA. The project, including procurement and financial&#13;
        management activities, will be intensively supervised by Bank staff inthe Country Office&#13;
        and by periodic, at least biannual, supervision missions.&#13;
    e    Evaluation Committee: The IDA will review and comments on the qualifications and&#13;
        experiences o f evaluation committee members selected by the PMU for each project&#13;
        activities to ensure that only the persons with appropriate qualifications are selected with&#13;
        no conflict o finterest.&#13;

&#13;
D. APPRAlSAL SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
1. Economic and Financial Analyses&#13;
[For details,please go ro Appendir 3c]&#13;
&#13;
32.      There are several benefits, some o f which cannot be priced (e.g, human lives saved).&#13;
Quantifiable economic benefits will mainly stem from the potential poultry losses avoided thanks to&#13;
the project's intervention. The standard practice of comparing the incremental stream of net&#13;
bcnctits ofthe 'with project' to the 'without prqject' scenario was applied. The incremental benefits&#13;
and costs of the project were evaluated for a period of 15 years, with a discount rate of 12 percent.&#13;
The calculation took into account potential losses in the poultry market, gains o f other meat sectors,&#13;
and capital loss in the poultry sector. In the with-project scenario, a 30% reduction in the likelihood,&#13;
o f a larger outbreak was assumed. The analysis derived and net present value of US$3.1 million&#13;
and an internal rate of return of 21.3%. A reduction in the capital loss in the poultry sector of 20%&#13;
(as opposed to 40% in the base case) would reduce the IRR to 6%. Sirnilarly, a value addcd loss in&#13;
thc poultry sector of 50% in the catastrophic event ycar and 20% in the long tcrm (as opposed to the&#13;
base values) would result in an IRR of I%.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2. Technical&#13;
&#13;
33.      So far, no avian influenza case has beenreported inthe country, although it is impossible&#13;
at this point to know if this i s due to zero incidence or inability to detect such incidences.&#13;
Therefore, the project strategy is based primarily on preventing the entry o f HPAI, and&#13;
introducing rapid and effective containment procedures should an outbreak occur. Project design&#13;
i s consistent with this strategy. The project focuses on high risk areas, most notably the areas&#13;
surrounding resting sites for migratory birds, as well as border crossings due to poultry imports.&#13;
It recognizes the weak implementation capacity of Government agencies, and has, therefore,&#13;
provided for strong capacity building, public-private sector partnerships, as well as support&#13;
frodclose collaboration with key international organizations (UNICEF, WHO, FAO, etc.. .). It&#13;
will also strengthen coordination among the various public agencies. Inpurchasing laboratory&#13;
and other equipment, arrangements will be put inplace (through training and servicing contracts)&#13;
to ensure their servicing ina cost-effective and timely manner.&#13;
&#13;
3. Fiduciary&#13;
&#13;
Procurement&#13;
[For details,please go toAppendix 6-j&#13;
&#13;
34.      The World Bank published a Country Procurement Assessment Report for Tajilastan in&#13;
December 2003. According to the assessment, the environment for conducting public&#13;
procurement inthe Republic o f Tajikistan is rated as "high risk". The major focus o f the resulting&#13;
action plan was on legislative reform, procurement procedures and practices, increased&#13;
accountability, organizational reform, and administrative capacity building. Implementation o f&#13;
the proposed recommendations i s expected to help the Government o f Tajikistan to 1) improve&#13;
procurement oversight and supervision; 2) limit unreasonably vast authorities o f the Procurement&#13;

Specialist in the PMU. This specialist has been successfully handling procurement for the Farm&#13;
Privatization Support, the Rural Infrastructure Rehabilitation, and Community Agnculture and&#13;
Watershed Management Projects, and her performance is judged satisfactory.          Moreover, as&#13;

35.      The financial management arrangements of the project are acceptable to the Bank. The&#13;
overall FMrisk for the project i s moderate except for the compensation fund that is considered to&#13;
be highrisk. However adequate mitigation measures and internal controls are required prior to the&#13;
disbursement o f funds and some o f the key controls are included below (appendices 3b and 7).&#13;
&#13;
36.      The financial management arrangements of the PMU currently responsible for the&#13;
implementation o f two Bank projects (RIRP and CAWMP) has been assessed and continuously&#13;
monitored as part o f project supervision, and has been found to have a good financial&#13;
management system. The RIRPi s closing inDecember 2006, whereas the proposed AI Project i s&#13;
expected to be effective starting in September 2006. There will, therefore, be a period o f overlap&#13;
o f these two projects, although the RIRP team would eventually be able to focus fully on the&#13;
proposed AI Project. Consequently, the financial management team will initially be expanded&#13;

with a local financial consultant for maximum one year to support current FM team. The RIR&#13;
Chief Accountant has obtained extensive howledge o f World Bank procedures and policies&#13;
duringthe last 8 years as a ChiefAccountant o fBank financed projects inTajikistan. The internal&#13;
control and flow o f funds arrangements are yet to be finalized for the compensation fund sub-&#13;
component, but the basic control procedures will be documented in a Compensation Fund&#13;
Operational Manual acceptable to the Bank. The flow o f funds under the compensation fund sub-&#13;
component will only begin after appropriate internal control and fund flow procedures have been&#13;
documented inthe financial manual that will be part of the Project Operational Manual and after&#13;
the Bank has assessedthe internal control arrangements as satisfactory. Appropriate flow o f funds&#13;

management arrangements are described inAppendix 7.&#13;
&#13;
37.     The current external audit arrangements for the existing project are acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. The project financial statements have been audited under block audit arrangements for the&#13;
last several years and acceptable audit reports have been provided to the Bank on time. The&#13;
annual audited statements and audit reports for the proposed project will be providedto the Bank&#13;
within six months o f the end o f each fiscal year. The audits will be conducted by a firm&#13;
acceptable to Bank inaccordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA) as issued by the&#13;
IFAC and on terms of reference acceptableto the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
4. Social&#13;
&#13;
38.     Family poultry in Tajilustan has a long tradition o f supplying rural households with&#13;
protein, as well as providing additional income, especially for women. These backyard flocks are&#13;
largely tended to by women with the help o f children. Such backyard flocks have limited access&#13;
to veterinary care and vaccinations, making them susceptible to various disease outbreaks, e.g.&#13;
Newcastle disease which is more prevalent. Their scavenging nature also makes them highly&#13;
susceptible to avian HPAI. Due to the involvement o f children in managing domestic birds&#13;
(feeding, egg collection, herding, etc.), awareness and educational efforts need to ensure that&#13;
children are effectively reached through the schools and provided with appropriately designed&#13;
information on Avian Influenza. Reaching women with critical HPAI awareness information will&#13;
also require specific targeting and use o f suitable dissemination and outreach channels. It will&#13;
also be important to build farmers' trust and encourage their participation in surveillance for the&#13;
Avian Influenza and in culling when that becomes necessary. Farmers will be hesitant to report&#13;
sick birds ifthey do not fully understand the containment strategy, and particularly ifthey do not&#13;
expect to receive compensation. Thus, the local surveillance and compensationarrangements will&#13;
involve local community members. In addition, care will be taken to ensure that female poultry&#13;
owners receive their due compensation. This will be addressed in the Compensation Fund&#13;
OperationalManual and monitored continuously as well as through annual surveys.&#13;
&#13;
5. Environment&#13;
[For details,pleasego toAppendix 81&#13;
&#13;
39.      Activities under AI projects have limited adverse environmental impacts as they are&#13;
focused largely on public sector capacity building and improved readiness for dealing with&#13;
outbreaks o f AI in domestic poultry. These prevention-focused activities are expected to have&#13;
positive environmental impacts as project investments in facilities, equipment, laboratories, and&#13;
training will improve the effectiveness and safety o f existing AI handling and testing procedures&#13;
by meeting international standards established by the OIE. This would be reinforced by the&#13;
mainstreaming o f environmental safeguards into the protocols and procedures for culling and&#13;
&#13;

CountryandAgricultureSector Background&#13;
&#13;
41.      Throughout the Soviet era, Tajikistan had one of the lowest GDPper capita. Therefore, of&#13;
the fifteen Soviet republics, Tajikistan received the highest transfers fi-om the central budget and&#13;
the country was also dependent on the other republicsfor food imports, mainly in exchange for&#13;
cotton and aluminum. After the collapse o f the Soviet Union, these transfers and subsidized&#13;
imports ceased and, at the time o f independence, the country's already weak economy was&#13;
disruptedby 1992-1997 civil war.&#13;
&#13;
42.      Since 2002-2005 the Government has pursued sound macroeconomic management policy&#13;
and strong fiscal discipline. Through successful macroeconomic reforms, Tajikistan has been able&#13;
to reduce inflation fi-om 30-40% percent during 1998-2001 to below 10% since 2004. Revenues&#13;
have increased fi-om 14% of GDP in 2000 to an estimated 20% of GDP in 2005. Rural poverty&#13;
has fallen significantly in response to these trends; with 64% of rural people below the poverty&#13;
line (US$2.15 day PPP) in 2003, compared to 82% in 1999. Two-thirds o f the population&#13;
completely depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. Indeed, the apcultural sector continues&#13;
to be an important part of Tajikistan's economy contributing 24% o f the country's GDP, 66% of&#13;
employment, 26% of exports, and 39% of tax revenue. This includes the small but important&#13;
poultry sector.&#13;
&#13;
PoultrySector Background&#13;
&#13;
43.      After independence and during the civil war, the number of hens and turkeys declined&#13;
sharply. From the reported 6.6 million hens and turkeys in 1991, about 675,000 were left by&#13;
1998. The number has increased slowly since then, reaching about 2.3 million or one third o f the&#13;
1991 population by 2004. During the Soviet era, intensive poultry production was concentrated&#13;
on state farms where about 90% o f poultry (and turkeys) were raised. Most production took place&#13;
inRegions of Republican Subordination Oblast with 47%, followed by Sughd Oblast with 38%.&#13;
Statistics from the Official State Statistical Committee (SSC) and FA0 suggest the increase in&#13;
poultry production since 2000 to have taken place in Khatlon and Regions o f Republican&#13;
Subordination Oblasts equally (both with 35% of production) with Sughd Oblast at 25% of&#13;
production rankmg next. Dushanbe city and GBAO produce roughly five percent o f poultry&#13;
between them.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
44.      Backyard poultry has an enduring tradition in Tajikistan and most rural families own&#13;
some, keeping them in flocks o f up to twenty birds. Such small, extensively raised units mainly&#13;
comprise chicken but they can include turkeys as well as quail and pigeons. Most o f the chicken&#13;
are native birds raised on household scraps and scavenged feed. Few improvedpoultry are raised&#13;
at village-level. While small, these flocks are important in the production o f eggs and chicken&#13;
meat, much o f which i s home-consumed. Some sales o f live hens are made directly to weekly&#13;
livestock markets, or to visiting traders who on-sell them in the more than 200 such markets&#13;
operating throughout the country. The producer price o f eggs ranges between 0.20 and 0.30&#13;
somoni each, and retailed for 0.25 to 0.35 somoni. Meat birds are also sold live. Some households&#13;
in Khatlon also raise turkeys, buying young birds and feeding them for about six months on&#13;
boiled chicken eggs initially, then on maize and wheat produced on their own small farms. The&#13;
finished birds are sold on the road-side, with a cleaned turkey fetching between 40 and 50&#13;
somoni, resulting a net household income o f about 200 to 300 somoni per month.&#13;
45.      The commercial poultry sector is comparatively small. Two large broiler plants&#13;
supplied the whole o f the Republic but stopped operating inthe early nineties, and no commercial&#13;
broiler units have been in operation since. Several small, circa 500 - 1,000 bird layer farms are&#13;
reported as having operated in Sughd until 2003 but went out o f business with the importation o f&#13;
cheap eggs and poultry meat from Iran. MOA reports one state-owned layer unit and 17 layer&#13;
units inthe private sector having a combined annual output capacity o f 150 million eggs. Eight of&#13;
these units are presently operating, but at only one third of potential. MOA reports their total&#13;
combined output at 48 million eggs for the year 2004.&#13;

                 Source: MOA data 2005. Reported farm performance&#13;
&#13;
46.      The largest poultry farm is a privatized, Soviet-era layer unit in Shakhrinav rayon, which&#13;
produces eggs from 160,000 birds based on day-old-chicks from Russia and compounded feed&#13;
from Kazakhstan, culling its layers at 18 months after two cycles. Three smaller, 40,000 bird&#13;
capacity egg production units operate in Shakrinav also. Performance on these farms is&#13;
determined almost entirely by the cost and availability o f feed which mostly i s imported from&#13;
Kazakhstan. High quality protein concentrates upon which local feed manufacture might be&#13;
possible are not available. Thus, when quality feed i s intermittently unavailable from Kazakhstan&#13;
local substitution of highquality fishmeal with local soybean meal inlocal rations has resulted in&#13;
dramatic and deleterious effects on production. The hi-bred Russian birds are much too sensitive&#13;
to feed quality, so that egg output may double or halve, depending on which type o f feed i s used.&#13;
47.      Official data on the poultry production and consumption since 1991 are not disaggregated&#13;
according to traditional or commercial sectors and there are some discrepancies. The most recent&#13;
SSC figures indicate the production o f 23.4 million eggs in 2000 increasing threefold to 77.6&#13;
million in 2004. MOA reports 100 million eggs to have been imported each year over the same&#13;
period. Per-capita consumption was 30 eggs for 2004 (SSC data) which suggests that 111million&#13;
eggs were imported for 2004 in addition to the 77.6 million eggs produced locally. The price o f&#13;
poultry meat and eggs has increased by 50% and 70% over the last five years respectively, and&#13;
egg consumption has increased by about 25% over the same period (MOA). The increasing&#13;
&#13;
                                                 15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
demand for eggs has mostly been suppliedby Iran (80%) and Russia (20%). About 5,800 tons o f&#13;
chicken meat was imported from Iran in 2004. Boxed chicken meat from the USA and Canada is&#13;
marketed in Tajikistan also. FA0 statistics for 2002 indicate an average consumption o f poultry&#13;
meat o f 0.4 kg and 8 eggs per person per year. The effective consumption o f poultry products is&#13;
probably higher than this as these figures do not incorporate the amount o f backyard poultry&#13;
production consumed informally.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Status of Veterinary Services&#13;
&#13;
48.      The State Veterinary Department (SVD) has been an organization in transition since&#13;
independence. Post-independence veterinary legislation defining the roles and responsibilities o f&#13;
S V D was adopted in 1993 and SVD became an independent budgetary unit within the Ministry o f&#13;
Agriculture in late 2002. Veterinary regulations prescribing the organization o f S V D and&#13;
providing basic veterinary and sanitary regulations, and regulations for quality control and&#13;
assigning government the control over infectious diseases including zoonoses, were introduced in&#13;
1995. The S V D was again restructured in October 2002 when the Main Veterinary Department&#13;
and State Veterinary Inspection were assigned independent budgetary status within the Ministry.&#13;
&#13;
49.      S V D has retained outdated strategies and infrastructure with respect to its national&#13;
responsibilities for disease control and many of the policies and regulations intended for the&#13;
veterinary services have not been prepared in detail. SVD also remains profoundly under-&#13;
resourced' and poorly organized at all levels. Therefore in attempting to reorganize the SVD,&#13;
Government committed to hlly privatizing its curative veterinary services and limitingthe role o f&#13;
S V D to regulatory and national disease control functions. As a result, but with no clear strategy,&#13;
timeframe or funding, S V D proposed to release 70 percent o f the 1,500 state veterinarians from&#13;
government service during 2005/6. It is generally accepted however, that this initiative will not&#13;
take place over the near term.&#13;
&#13;
50.      The Minister o f Agriculture appoints the SVD Chief to direct the heads o f the sub-&#13;
departments and functional units dealing with animal health. Those which handle livestock&#13;
diseases directly include the Republican Epizootological Expedition which comprises a cadre o f&#13;
about 60 technical personnel in the central offices and laboratories and smaller units in each&#13;
oblast, whose task it is to move quickly to the field inresponse to sudden and unexpected animal&#13;
disease outbreaks. The longer-term and more routine address o f animal health issues i s handled&#13;
separately by a small cadre o f epidemiologists within the Republican Epizootological Expedition,&#13;
whose task it is intheory to plan and amend the design o f ongoing (mainly ruminant) vaccination&#13;
programs. This should be done according to reported changes inthe dynamics o f any o f the five&#13;
livestock disease3 for which SVD has been responsible. However, SVD has a centrally-driven&#13;
vaccination plan which favors the state and dekhan farms, rather than a pragmatic&#13;
epidemiologically-based program dealing with livestock across the sub-sector. Outside o f the&#13;
commercial farms which mostly employ their own veterinarians, there is very little support for&#13;
poultry. Foot and mouth disease i s endemic among ruminants and a major outbreak occurred in&#13;
2002 which led to a government-ordered slaughter of infected animals. No outbreaks have been&#13;
officially reported since. Out o f the total allotment o f US$ 420,000 for epidemic disease control&#13;
for 2004 however, 60% or US$ 252,000 was allocated to vaccinating against foot and mouth&#13;
disease alone.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Onlyeight o fthe SVD offices in65 rayons are equippedwithmotor vehicles.&#13;
  FMD, Brucellosis, Tuberculosis, Rinderpest, Anthrax. The Departmentis proposingto substitute PPRfor&#13;
Rinderpest.&#13;
&#13;
                                                   16&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
51.      Information on disease normally passes from the veterinarians in the kishlaks (villages)&#13;
who occupy the few clinics in every rayon, thence through the Chiefs o f the Veterinary&#13;
Departments in the rayons and oblasts to the epidemiologists in VEE. The planned response&#13;
passes in turn from the central epidemiologists to the Chief o f SVD who formally decides on a&#13;
course o f action. Fundspermitting, the agreed plan i s transmitted as a field program to the Chiefs&#13;
inthe sub-central offices for implementation. However, SVD needs to be much more pro-active&#13;
and considered inthe surveillance and control o f diseases than it has been. This i s because much&#13;
of the livestock population outside o f the state sector i s still at risk from epidemic diseases within&#13;
the country and across its borders.&#13;
&#13;
52.      Diagnostic work i s done by the State RepublicanLaboratory (SRL), as well as the myriad&#13;
subordinate laboratories4 the SVD veterinarians from the kishlaks or in some cases farmers,&#13;
submit samples directly to for diagnosis. The layout, staff training and capacity of the SRL&#13;
precludes its utility as a diagnostic laboratory for AI virology. The Foot and Mouth Disease&#13;
Institute however, i s much better suited to this function. FMDIwas established during the Soviet&#13;
era specifically for Virological tests. It still conducts some virology diagnostic work and has&#13;
better trained staffinvirology, and it i s also a better laid out laboratory. FMDIis outside the aegis&#13;
of SVD, butthere is a working relationshipbetweenFMDIand SVD inrespect of foot andmouth&#13;
disease virology which FMDIdoes at the request o f SVD.&#13;
&#13;
53.      The Department o f Border Control has the formal role o f protecting Tajilustan from the&#13;
ingress o f disease, maintaining twenty-one monitoring and control points at airports, border&#13;
crossings and railway stations which are mannedby staff attached to the relevant rayon or oblast-&#13;
level offices. The Department also has a supervisory role inrespect o f the health status o f animals&#13;
passing through livestock markets, but the extent to which the Department enacts its movement&#13;
control prerogative effectively i s not known. Other departments supporting, but less directly&#13;
involved in animal health, include the Department o f Veterinary and Sanitary Expertise the State&#13;
Laboratory on Standardization and Testing o f Veterinary Medicines, and the Department o f&#13;
Planning and Finance.&#13;
&#13;
54.      The national departmental structure i s replicated in the oblasts and rayons, and staff&#13;
numbers for SVD substantially increase at every administrative level. The Department has 64&#13;
Rayon-level veterinary offices and 286 veterinary clinics, thus the S V D Chief in each o f the&#13;
oblasts typically has eight to ten staff and there are 13 - 25 rayons per oblast with between ten&#13;
and fifteen persons each. Some rayons have up to forty veterinarians located at lushlak level,&#13;
bringing the number o f veterinarians employed in government field service, to about 1,500&#13;
persons with some overlap with the `privatized' veterinarians. They are the field resource upon&#13;
which SVD must rely to conduct disease investigative measures or to deal with outbreaks, but&#13;
these field personnel are not well supported.&#13;
&#13;
55.      There are ten institutes subordinated to the Academy o f Agricultural Science o f the&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture which are engaged in research activities for the sector as a whole. Of&#13;
relevance to animal health are the Foot and Mouth Disease Institute and the Veterinary Research&#13;
Institute. These formerly conducted research and manufactured vaccines and biologcals, but are&#13;
reducedto diagnostic laboratories now.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 three regional laboratories, one zonal laboratory, 10 inter-district laboratories, 15 district laboratories and&#13;
75 market-place laboratories.&#13;

Report on Outbreaks inthe Neighboring Countries and PotentialRisks for Tajikistan&#13;
&#13;
56.     T o date, Tajilustan has not had any recorded outbreaks o f highly pathogenic avian flu&#13;
(HPAI H5N1). However, according to media reports, there have been recent outbreaks in the&#13;
nearby countries o f China and Kazakhstan as well as more distant neighborhood countries such as&#13;
Russia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, Iraq and India. The H5N1 strain o f avian influenza was confirmed in&#13;
neighboring Afghanistan on March 16,2006 from samples taken from birds inthe Dasht-e-Barchi&#13;
district o f Kabul, from Jalalabad City and Khogani City. The collapse o f veterinary health&#13;
services caused by the 1992-1997 civil war and the recent increase in trans-boundary trade i s&#13;
increasing the threat o f an outbreak o f HPAIinTajilustan. There i s also some riskthat the spread&#13;
o f H5N1 to poultry in Tajikistan will take place during waterfowl migration or through trade in&#13;
live-bird markets and the movement o finfected domestic fowl.&#13;
&#13;
Migratory birdflyways and habitats&#13;
&#13;
57.     Migratory birds crossing Tajikistan from the north of Central Asia to the southern areas&#13;
o f Afghanistan and Iran use a small number o f principal flyways in their falhpring migrations.&#13;
Some species use these simply as over-fly routes without settling, but others alight along the way&#13;
on the watercourses these routes mostly follow. The primary route between Uzbekistan and&#13;
northern Afghanistan runs roughly northeasthouthwest over Tajikistan and passes over Dushanbe&#13;
at its southern end. The other main route runs roughly northhouth between Uzbekistan and&#13;
Afghanistan passing along the Fergana valley in the north. Both o f these routes intersect in the&#13;
area o f Dushanbe. Some secondary flyways follow the main river valleys along the Whakhan&#13;
corridor on the PakistdTajikistan border and along the many valleys in Tajikistan's&#13;
centre/south. These feeders terminate at their southern end inthe 53,000 square kmmarsh area on&#13;
the border with Afghanistan known as the Tiger Jungle, with one other important route also&#13;
runningnortheasthouthwestalongthe Ferganavalley.&#13;
&#13;
58.      These routes are associated with the several lakes, rivers and reservoirs inside Tajilustan&#13;
which serve as important wintering habitats for both wild and migratory birds. The Tiger Jungle&#13;
adjacent to the border with now HPAI-infected Afghanistan is one, but other important locations&#13;
include the Kayrakkum Reservoir inAsht Rayon inthe north, the Iskanderkul Lake inAini rayon&#13;
on the central-western border and the Nurek Water Reservoir in Nurek Rayon in Tajikistan's&#13;
centre. The risk o f HPAI virus transferring from birds utilizing the resting places, flyways and&#13;
their crossover points therefore extends over the entire western part o f the country and&#13;
encompasses most o f the rayons raising relatively important numbers o f poultry. Wild birdsusing&#13;
the KayrakkumReservoir habitat therefore threaten poultry in at least eleven rayons in RRS, the&#13;
Iskanderkul Lake habitat threatens at least eight in Sughd in the central west, and twelve rayons&#13;
in Khatlom province have proximity to birds using the Tiger Jungle in the south. These&#13;
movements and habitats are o f enormous importanceinthe design o f HPAI surveillance.&#13;
&#13;
HumanHealth Sector&#13;
&#13;
59.      Tajikistan's health system has a number o f structural weaknesses, most o f which are&#13;
common to post-Soviet and transition economies. There are significant capacity gaps in health&#13;
policy, planning and management, both at the central level and among oblast, rayon and facility&#13;
health administrators.    Essential public health functions such as disease surveillance, human&#13;
resource development and health promotion are carried out poorly, if at all. Outbreak&#13;
investigation capacity i s very limited with significant technical and methodological deficiencies.&#13;
Infectious disease surveillance system, sanitary inspection control and health promotion are&#13;
carried out by Sanitary Epidemiological and Surveillance Center (SES).            The institutional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 18&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
arrangements for disease control through the national disease surveillance system vanes&#13;
depending uponthe disease at issue and whether or not there i s a special disease-specific vertical&#13;
program in place. System for collection o f specimens from the field i s inadequate and there are&#13;
n o facilities available for dry ice production inthe country. However, arrangements for customs&#13;
clearance o f the shipment o f specimens to international designatedlaboratories are inplace.&#13;
&#13;
60.       The structure o f the health delivery system inherited from the Soviet Union is a highly&#13;
complex and hierarchical system. Outpatient services are provided at polyclinics that are&#13;
segmented into separate clinics for adults, children, and women's reproductive health, Family&#13;
Medicine Centers, and through specialized dispensaries, that address specific diseases such as&#13;
tuberculosis, oncology, endocrinology, and others.        There are also health posts attached to&#13;
schools, public enterprises, and other institutions. The rural outpatient services are also provided&#13;
through the Medical Houses, Rural Physician Ambulatory Facilities (SVA) and Rural Hospitals&#13;
(SUB). The health system contained a large number o f hospitals, with a separate hierarchy of&#13;
hospitals at the national, Oblast, City, District and village levels, and a large number o f&#13;
specialties. Currently, Tajikistan has a total o f 448 hospitals ranging in sizes fkom facilities with&#13;
20 beds to over 500 beds. From an international perspective, there i s very small number o f&#13;
population served per facility, even adjusting for the fact that the country is dominated by&#13;
sparsely population rural regions. Most o f the facilities are not suitable for patients. Equipment&#13;
has deteriorated due to lack o f maintenance or i s completely missing; sanitary facilities seldom&#13;
work and are in generally in poor condition; isolation boxes o f infectious diseases clinics are&#13;
outdated and inneed o f major renovation; laboratory services are rarely used and are generally in&#13;
poor conditions. The number o f hospital beds in Tajihstan has decreased steadily and in the&#13;
early 1990s, there was a deliberate effort to reduce the number o f hospital beds by about 30&#13;
percent as part of the rationalizationprogram. Unfortunately, this reduction inbeds also resulted&#13;
inareductionofthe healthbudget, which islinkedtonumber o fbedsrather thanto services. The&#13;
decrease inhospital beds was intended to be replacedby an increase inprimary care services, but&#13;
due to lack o f resources progress has been slow in this area. Official statistics indicated that the&#13;
hospital admission rates have decreased. The reduction in utilization o f hospital services would&#13;
seem to be attributable to inadequate financing, absence o f necessary medicines, and decline in&#13;
hospital quality services, rather than on improvements in the primary care health sector. The&#13;
average length o f stay has stayed around 13 days, while bed occupancy rate has dropped to below&#13;
50 percent, indicating significant inefficiencies inthe system.&#13;
&#13;
61.        The impact o f the resource constraint i s evident in the very l o w quality o f services as&#13;
reflected inlow utilization and access to health services. It is estimated that in 2003 around half&#13;
of those who reportedacute illnesses did not use health services, for a variety o f reasons related to&#13;
inadequate supply, poor access and low demand for health care. Financial barriers are cited most&#13;
often as a reason for not accessing health services. Physical barriers are most acute inthe remote&#13;
mountainous regions, where road conditions are poor, means o f transport limited, and many&#13;
communities are totally cut o f f for months during winter season. Geographic variations in the&#13;
availability o f health services also appear to be a result o f unequal distribution o f government&#13;
financing.&#13;
&#13;
62.        With inadequacy o f government support for basic health services, many communities in&#13;
Tajikistan are beginning to take action to address these problems on their own, and the number o f&#13;
community-based activities has been increasing over the past decade.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   19&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
International donor assistance&#13;
&#13;
63.     Animal health. With three main thrusts, FA0 has provided most support for the sub-&#13;
sector by far. With Swedish assistance in April 1999 FA0 financed a progressively larger&#13;
network o f veterinarians inwhat i s essentially a privatized system of veterinary service delivery.&#13;
In this role they have provided a disease sentinel function throughout Tajilustan as well as&#13;
vaccinating during SVD programs. More than 437 veterinarians were operational by mid 2005.&#13;
Building on its brucellosis survey conducted during May 2003, FA0 introduced a national&#13;
approach to controlling brucellosis in Tajilustan's high risk regions. The National Brucellosis&#13;
Control Programbegan inKhatlon in2004 and together with improvements to the diagnostic and&#13;
monitoring structure for important livestock diseases, was expanded in the winter o f 2004/5 to&#13;
extend brucellosis vaccination to a further eight Rayons inthe Rasht Valley. Early in 2005 FA0&#13;
began a three year project to address the principal trans-boundary animal diseases in seven o f the&#13;
region's countries, in which S V D staff was trained in data collection, diagnostic techniques and&#13;
the development outbreak contingency plans. The project also co-financed the preparation and&#13;
distribution o f awarenessmaterial for Avian Influenza.&#13;
&#13;
64.      Under its TACIS Policy Advice Program, the European Union is also supporting the&#13;
development o f national veterinary livestock and animal disease control policy as part of an 8&#13;
million Euro grant for 2005/6. This program suppoi-ts policy reform in several ministries, M O A&#13;
included. The policy for animal health was to have been drafted and approved by MOA by&#13;
December 2005. Additional support for the sector comes from CARE International which offers&#13;
limited assistance to animal health by distributing livestock production information, establishing&#13;
and equipping veterinary centers and financing a small number o f veterinary field units.&#13;
&#13;
65.      German Agro Action offers some foot and mouth disease vaccinations and training in&#13;
livestock keeping, and limitedrepayment-in-kmd livestock credit inthe Zarashan Valley. AKRSP&#13;
provides some livestock distribution inthe Rasht Valley also. Mercy Corps International (MCI) i s&#13;
operating in most o f Sughd Oblast, the Rasht Valley and Tavildara rayon, as well as in several&#13;
rayons inTajikistan's southwestern comer. Both German A g o Action and MCIhave a substantial&#13;
field presence, each having between 150 and 200 local staff and several technical experts. M C I&#13;
provides micro-credit for livestock as well as food security programs and market linkages through&#13;
its seven widely-spread field offices throughout the country.&#13;
&#13;
 66.     Human Health. The international community plays an important role in the supporting&#13;
response to protect human health from AI, especially as there is a need to develop an overall&#13;
 framework to guide a national action plan that is the basis for government and donor support and&#13;
 ensure effective implementation. Capacity gaps inhealthpolicy, planning and management, both&#13;
 at the central level and among oblast, rayon and facility health administrators and weak&#13;
 implementation of essential public health functions such as disease surveillance, human resource&#13;
 development and health promotion, necessitates strong support from international community in&#13;
 combating AI. This project document and the associated documents which detail the description&#13;
 of activities under the broader program developed by the Government o f Tajilustan and partners&#13;
 are an example of a move inthis direction.    WHO i s coordinating the global response to human&#13;
 cases of H5N1 avian influenza and monitoring the corresponding threat o f an influenza pandemic.&#13;
 UNICEF is workmg closely with governments, UNorganizations and other partners through the&#13;
 UNCountry Teams and other partners to arm families with the knowledge and practices they&#13;
 needto protect themselves and their birds from avian influenza and to be ready to respond to the&#13;
 emergence of apandemic.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
67.      The project will consist o f the following four major components: (i) Preparedness&#13;
                                                                                Public&#13;
and Information Component, (ii)     Human Health, (iii), Health, and (iv) Implementation&#13;
                                                           Animal&#13;
Support and Monitoring and Evaluation Component.&#13;
&#13;
I. PublicAwarenessandInformationComponent&#13;
&#13;
68.      The objective o f this component will be to minimize the risk o f avian influenza&#13;
spreading throughout the country by ensuring that citizens understand the threat are aware o f&#13;
the symptoms and are willing and able to engage in behaviors to protect themselves and their&#13;
community. The component will support the implementation o f a communication program to&#13;
address key aspects o f prevention, preparedness and response inTajikistan. This program will&#13;
be based on a comprehensive communication strategy and accompanying action plan. It is&#13;
expected that UNICEFwill take the lead inhelping the Government implement this program.&#13;
&#13;
69.      The communicationresponse, which will have three sub-components, will have three&#13;
planned stages in:&#13;
   i..Aseriesofpre-outbreakcampaignstopromotesafeandresponsiblebehaviortoreduce&#13;
      risks to children, families, households and communities;&#13;
  ii.Anintensivecommunicationcampaignduringanepidemicalert,tobegmimmediatelyif&#13;
       and when human infection i s confirmed.&#13;
 iii.Postepidemiccommunicationsupporttopromoterecoveryandtohelpthosewhoneed&#13;
       it.&#13;
&#13;
(i) Avian Influenza Advocacy Sub-component.&#13;
&#13;
70.      This first sub-component will aim at putting the AI on the agenda o f decision-makers&#13;
with the understanding that unless government officials at all levels, members o f Parliament, the&#13;
media, business community and others are aware o f the threats posed by the disease and the role&#13;
that they themselves can play to prevent it, this initiative will not be successful. Activities under&#13;
this sub-component will include workshops, study tour(s), training ofjournalists, development o f&#13;
a newsletter, etc.    This sub-component will also include setting up a crisis communication&#13;
mechanismwithin the Government.&#13;
&#13;
(ii) Public Education through Mass Media Sub-Component.&#13;
&#13;
71.      The second sub-component will entail the design and implementation o f several mass&#13;
media campaigns aimed at the public at large. The sub-component will start by carrying out an&#13;
opinion research study to gauge the level o f howledge, understanding and practices o f the&#13;
population on issues related to avian flu (from keeping birds to behaviors when sick with flu).&#13;
The sub-component will also include the production of print and audiovisual materials&#13;
(brochures, booklets, Public Service Announcements - PSAs) as well as the adaptation to the&#13;
Tajik context o f TV/radio programsproduced internationally.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  24&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(iii) Social Mobilization Sub-component.&#13;
&#13;
72.       The third sub-component will be a series o f activities aimed at mobilizing the&#13;
population through the various networks, public and private, that have strong presence inthe rural&#13;
areas. From the system o f school teachers, a vast group of established professionals worlung&#13;
through Tajikistan and often enjoying the trust of the rural populations, to the networks o f&#13;
veterinaries or community health workers etc., these are communities that can easily be tapped&#13;
into and mobilized as vectors of the communication effort. Training on AI, informationmaterials&#13;
should be provided to them, and as well as specific coaching on the important role they could&#13;
play inthis initiative.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
11. AnimalHealthComponent&#13;
&#13;
73.      The project would support a national program to develop and implement HPAI&#13;
prevention, containment and control and eradication activities. This Component would&#13;
specifically strengthen the Government's preparednessfor conducting surveillance, diagnosis and&#13;
response to an outbreak of Avian Influenza among domestic commercial and household-raised&#13;
poultry. The component has two mainsub-components:&#13;
&#13;
(i) StrengtheningtheNational HPAIPreparedness and Prevention Capability Sub-Component&#13;
&#13;
74.      Strengthening the Institutional Environment. The project would support initiatives to&#13;
ensure the legal and regulatory and operational fkamework for disease prevention, detection,&#13;
containment and eradication i s effective, and in accordance with standards which OIE and FA0&#13;
have established for dealing with animal diseases generally. The project provides Technical&#13;
Assistance to review the current veterinary legislative framework and assure its alignment with&#13;
the functions o f the State Veterinary Department and its address o f AI inparticular. This review&#13;
would involve the technical assistance o f experts in veterinary legislation and regulation,&#13;
veterinary staff of M O A and legal representatives. The review would have particular focus on&#13;
regulations related to the control o f notifiable animal diseases, the responsibilities o f the present&#13;
public and private veterinary services in an outbreak of AI, and provisions for compensating&#13;
poultry owners if this became necessary in the event ,of mandatory culling. Institutionally, the&#13;
resources, training and disposition of the State Veterinary Department (SVD) prevent it from&#13;
responding to the increased demand for information, diagnostic capability and prompt response&#13;
capability the threat of AI entering Tajikistan now poses. The SVD needs assistance in&#13;
developing these capabilities, particularly if it i s to comply with the international standards of&#13;
OIE and the recommendations FA0has developed for countries dealingwith AI.&#13;
&#13;
75.      TA would be provided also to review the existing operatingprocedures and protocols of&#13;
SVD, and to assistwith the drafting of detailedimplementation guidelines andmanuals for use by&#13;
SVD staff at all levels. This assistance would also ensure that these operating guidelines are&#13;
compatible with the requirements o f an effective, national AI program.&#13;
&#13;
76.      The National Action and Contingency Plan. Government has already taken some limited&#13;
short-term measures-wild bird and poultry sampling       - todeal with the threat that the presence of&#13;
AI inIran andAfghanistan now represents andhasprepared a draft National PreparednessPlan -&#13;
the Comprehensive Plan of M O H and MOA. The Plan requires considerably more detail and&#13;
greater clarity inrespect o f the policies and objectives needed to drive the program if it i s to be&#13;
useful. The project would provide technical assistance to more fully prepare the plan to ensure it&#13;
as a national AI contingency plan, by focusing on developing the procedures for outbreak&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  25&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
planning and incorporating the detail o f outbreak response - the surveillance procedures, roles&#13;
and responsibilities, communication protocols particularly with respect to MOH, movement&#13;
controls, testing procedures, culling programs, compensation procedures and restockmg. The&#13;
specialists responsible for this would work with the SVD epidemiology and field staff, the&#13;
laboratory personnel both inthe SVD and the FMDIfacilities, private veterinarians inthe rayons&#13;
and agencies particularly FAO, involved intrans-boundary animal disease control.&#13;
&#13;
77.      Support would also be provided for the participation o f S V D personnel in regional&#13;
information exchanges and to attend FA0 or OIE-hosted conferences on AI. The project would&#13;
also provide for simulation exercises in each Oblast to test the plan and familiarize participants at&#13;
all levels with their roles as soon as practicable after the plan i s finalized. Crucial to the Plan are&#13;
the Standard Operating Procedures which implementers at all levels would use, and developing&#13;
these and the sampling and diagnostic protocols would be the other main focus of the technical&#13;
assistance&#13;
&#13;
78.      Establishing a National Compensation Policy and Fund. Early detection and reporting o f&#13;
a possible AI event depends entirely on incentives to owners to quickly report any sick or dead&#13;
poultry. Inthe event o f an enforced poultry cull, adequate arrangements for compensation have&#13;
proven essential if this i s to happen. There are no veterinary laws which prescribe arrangements&#13;
for compensation nor i s there a recent history in Tajikistan o f compensation being paid for&#13;
livestock destroyed under State compulsion. The project will (i)             establish an entirely new&#13;
compensation fund and (ii)provide expert technical assistance to identify workable&#13;
implementation arrangements for it. These would include the management and financing&#13;
arrangements of the fund itself, eligibility criteria, payment arrangements and the flow o f funds.&#13;
N o compensation payments would be made from the fund until these arrangements have been&#13;
satisfactorily finalized and operatingprocedures prepared and laid down as operating procedures.&#13;
&#13;
(ii) Strengthening the Disease Surveillance, Diagnostic and Containment Capacity Sub-&#13;
 Component&#13;
&#13;
79.      Strengthening the disease Monitoring and Containment System.                Support would be&#13;
provided to bringthe SVD into line with OIE standards. It would include (i)         technical assistance,&#13;
 (ii) forcentral-levelandfieldstaff,(iii) mobilityandcommunications,(iv)sampling&#13;
     training                                      field&#13;
 equipment and (v) equipment and materials for culling and disposal. Training in surveillance for&#13;
the country's 21 border and airport inspection posts would be included. The project would use&#13;
 expert technical assistance inveterinary epidemiology to train and assist an Epidemiology Unit in&#13;
 the design and implementation o f an effective national AI surveillance program. The project&#13;
 would also finance support for field sampling, by training S V D field surveillance staff in the 3&#13;
 oblast and 65 rayon offices in (i)surveillance methodology, (ii) recognition, (iii)&#13;
                                                                           AI                    sample&#13;
 collection, (iv) sample submission and (v) reporting. Offices at these levels would also be&#13;
 suppliedwithmotorcyclesand communication and samplingequipment.&#13;
&#13;
 80.     Training would also target the owners o f large commercial private poultry farms and their&#13;
 veterinarians in (i)the conduct o f passive surveillance and (ii) application o f appropriate bio-&#13;
                                                                    the&#13;
 security measures to be used on commercial farms at risk. The Republican Epizootic Expedition&#13;
 inDushanbe would be supplied a motor vehicle to improve its ability to mount a rapid outbreak&#13;
 response insupport o f the field veterinarians.&#13;
&#13;
 81.     Expert technical assistance would be used to establish an animal disease data-base based&#13;
 on TADINFO or similar software, and the Epidemiology Unit at S V D headquarters would be&#13;
 supplied the computer equipment, software and training necessary. This capability would allow&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  26&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
outbreak and sampling data and the downstream information on virus identification to be input to&#13;
the TADINFO system and GIS mapped. The Epidemiologxal Unit would then have the ability to&#13;
adjust the surveillance program inlight o f information input to the data base over time. The main&#13;
border crossing points for poultry movement would be supported with protective equipment,&#13;
sprayers and disinfectant.&#13;
&#13;
82.     Wild andmigratory birdsare a known and significant threat to domestic poultry andthere&#13;
are several identified high-risklocations associated with them. The changing environment in the&#13;
countries these birds use at each end o f their transit means that existing data o n source and&#13;
destination, as well as the species and numbers usingknown flight paths and local habitats, is not&#13;
as reliable as it was. Updating this information would permit a more accurate assessment o f the&#13;
threat they pose at specific locations and crossover points. The Institute o f Zoology would be&#13;
contracted to survey wild and migratory birds over the three years, so as to relate the HPAIvirus&#13;
to bird species, numbers and movement. This information would also flow into the&#13;
Epidemiological Unit information database and provide another important data source upon&#13;
which the surveillance program would be adjusted.&#13;
&#13;
83.      Strengthening National Diagnostic Capacity.       The layout and capability of the S V D&#13;
Republican Laboratory precludes its utility as a diagnostic laboratory for AI virology. FMDI&#13;
established during the Soviet era specifically for Virological tests, provides a much better basis&#13;
upon which to conduct HPAI virology. FMDI i s outside the aegis of SVD, but the project will&#13;
substantially renovate part o f its building. Technical assistance would be used inredesigning the&#13;
lab and its layout and establishing RT-PCR capability. Highvolume sample preparation and other&#13;
equipment will handle the substantial number o f samples that FMDI i s expected to receive. No&#13;
sample screening would be done at the SVD laboratories in the oblasts. Instead, these will be&#13;
renovated and equipped, and used as hubs where samples from the rayons can be held and&#13;
dispatched to FMDI. These holding laboratories will be supplied vehicles and cold storage&#13;
equipment. The FMDI lab will perform generic PCR as an initial screening function. Positive&#13;
samples will be virus typed and the results o f these procedures will be passed to the&#13;
Epidemiological Unit and the MOH, as well as to the OIE. Staff will be trained overseas inPCR&#13;
technique and two staff will also be trained overseas specifically in the laboratory diagnosis of&#13;
Avian Viral Diseases&#13;
&#13;
84.      Strengthening the Animal Disease Information Systems. Key to the success o f the&#13;
surveillance and reaction program is an effective animal disease information system. Project&#13;
assistance would be provided to improve the reporting o f animal health information from the field&#13;
and its flow between SVD, the MOH and OIE. This capability would be established at the&#13;
Republican Epizootological Expedition, the repository for the central-level epidemiology and&#13;
reactive capability o f SVD. The project would supply (i)     technical assistance, (ii)&#13;
                                                                                       epidemiology&#13;
training for central and subordinate-level staff, (iii) computer equipment and (iv) a TADINFO&#13;
database. The system would be linked to fast, standardized methods of surveillance data analysis.&#13;
This would demonstrate any important changes in the H5N1 situation over time, to be used in&#13;
amending the surveillance program as necessary. The other main function o f an efficient disease&#13;
information systemi s to enable SVD to participate inglobal disease information sharing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 27&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
111.     HumanHealthComponent&#13;
&#13;
85.     The component will support a national program to implement HPIA prevention,&#13;
preparedness and planning, response and containment activities in the human health sector&#13;
specific to the needs o f the Tajikistan in the short, medium and longer term. These activities&#13;
reflect an assessment o f the particular risks, conditions, constraints, needs and possibilities inthe&#13;
country, including a rapid assessment o f the health services undertaken by the appraisal team&#13;
supported by WHO and UNICEF.&#13;
&#13;
86.     To prevent an outbreak among humans, initial support under this project would&#13;
concentrate o n a few key areas, including activities for: (i)enhancing public health program&#13;
planning and coordination; (ii)    strengthening o f the national public health surveillance system;&#13;
and (iii)strengthening the health system response capacity.             The interventions under the&#13;
component are based on the Tajikistan epidemiological and programmatic needs, and well-&#13;
assessed options for meeting them. They will be grouped inthree broad sub-components:&#13;
&#13;
(i) Enhancing Public Health Program Planning and Coordination Sub-component&#13;
&#13;
87.     Under this sub-component, funding would be available for: (i)      establishing inter-sectoral&#13;
command and control system structures and development o f their institutional capacity, including&#13;
public, private, civil society organizations; (ii)identifying crucial gaps ininfrastructure and other&#13;
resources, as well as laws andor statutes which, ifnot corrected, may interfere with an effective&#13;
response; (iii) defining operational priorities, such as a mass immunization campaign during an&#13;
infectious disease emergency; (iv) ensuring coordination among all stakeholders; and (v)&#13;
establishing central field investigationteams.&#13;
&#13;
88.      When outbreaks in animals occur, active human case detection shouldbe carried out by a&#13;
joint veterinarian and health team from central level. This would require the development o f&#13;
epidemiologic intelligence capacity to assess and verify events and rumors, dispatch teams to&#13;
investigate, and assist regional and local levels in infectious control measures.            The sub-&#13;
component would finance the development of Standard OperatingProcedures and training o f staff&#13;
at different levels o f the health system in detection, testing, clinical management, epidemiology,&#13;
reporting and laboratory bio-safety o f relevance to influenza-like illnesses and other relevant&#13;
infectious diseases. It would also finance short courses on applied epidemiology to strengthen&#13;
surveillance. To improve coordination between the public health agencies and the veterinary&#13;
departments, joint training activities would be supported involving epidemiologists, clinicians,&#13;
laboratory staff, and veterinarians. The subcomponent would support development o f standard&#13;
case   definitions,   active   clinical  and virological      surveillance   criteria and reporting&#13;
protocols/systems for influenza-like illnesses, fevers o f unknown origin and other relevant&#13;
infectious diseases.&#13;
&#13;
 89.     Additionally, support would be provided for health preparedness and response plan&#13;
preparation, and to finance a simulation exercise at national level involving regional and local&#13;
levels, as well as supranational levels. These plans would include activities to protect healthcare&#13;
workers and other personnel.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  28&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(ii) Strengthening of National Public Health Surveillance Systems Sub-component&#13;
&#13;
90.      T o assess risks to public health and guide protective measures, information i s needed on&#13;
the extent o f influenza infection in animals and humans and on circulating viruses, as well as&#13;
other priority infectious diseases. The national surveillance systems must be improved.&#13;
&#13;
91.      The detection o f novel influenza strains i s done through clinical and virological&#13;
surveillance o f human and animal influenza disease. There are four main national surveillance&#13;
areas that need to be strengthened: (i)      virologic surveillance to report the number o f clinical&#13;
specimens tested for influenza and other priority infectious diseases and the number o f positive&#13;
results by virus type and sub-type (this i s crucial for proper vaccine seed strain); (ii)&#13;
                                                                                        surveillance&#13;
for influenza-like illness and other priority infectious diseases to report on the number of patient&#13;
visits for influenza-like illness and other priority infectious diseases by age group and the total&#13;
number o f patient visits each week; (iii)  surveillance for influenza and pneumonia, as well as for&#13;
other priority infectious diseases to report the total deaths related to influenza and other priority&#13;
infectious diseases; and (iv) oblast andrayon epidemiologists to assessesandreport influenza and&#13;
other priority infectious diseases activity levels in their respective localities.      Surveillance&#13;
systems should be enhanced prior to the start o f a pandemic, to ensure that the high demand for&#13;
timely information that can be anticipated in a pandemic can be met. To this end, project would&#13;
support:&#13;
&#13;
92.      Improvements o f Laboratory Networks. The Republican Sanitary and Epidemiological&#13;
Surveillance Laboratory (SES) serves as the national reference laboratory for Tajikistan. Its main&#13;
role i s analysis o f environmental samples (sanitary and quality assurance for food), but it also&#13;
function as a bacterial reference laboratory for Tajilustan. Laboratory gets only few samples for&#13;
diagnosis directly fiom hospitals. However, due to the lack of funding, routine diagnostic i s often&#13;
not available.&#13;
&#13;
93.      The SES has allocated 5 rooms for a molecular diagnosis and serology laboratory for AI.&#13;
However, these rooms require extensive renovations in order to meet the requirements for bio-&#13;
safety level 2, which i s mandatory for handling AI diagnostic specimens according to&#13;
international and WHO guidelines.         Furthermore these rooms need to be fully equipped and&#13;
designated personnel have to undergo bio-safetyhio-security, virological and molecular training&#13;
before work on HPAI virus can start. Staff will be trained overseas in PCR technique and two&#13;
staff will also be trained overseas specifically inthe laboratory diagnosis o f Avian Viral Diseases.&#13;
Further more support will be provided for appropriate waste disposal, and packaging o f&#13;
diagnostic samples for international shippingto the Influenzareference laboratory inEngland.&#13;
&#13;
94.      Improvement o f Health Information and Telecommunication Systems. This sub-&#13;
component would finance rapid adaptation and strengthening o f existing health information&#13;
systems and processes to improve the timely and effective reporting of influenza-like illnesses&#13;
and other priority infectious diseases o f direct relevance to a potential epidemic o f Avian&#13;
Influenza. The sub-component would provide finds for technical assistance, training and IT&#13;
equipment to strengthen the areas o f surveillance, communications, and information technology&#13;
at the different levels o f the health care system. The focus would be on supporting the country's&#13;
preparedness and capacity to respond to avian influenza and other infectious disease outbreaks&#13;
through reduction o f reporting time and time required for analysis o f the epidemiological&#13;
situation. The technical assistance would develop guidelines for essential procedures for each&#13;
level o f health system on continuous surveillance for influenza-like illness and reporting&#13;
mechanism and protocols for routine reporting usingIT and designate telephone hot-line. Printed&#13;
materials with strict guidelines for each level and each facility will be produced and follow up&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  29&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
workshops would be organized at regional levels to disseminate the information. Mechanism for&#13;
reporting o f infectious diseases will be strengthened including introduction o f software for&#13;
reporting of infectious diseases from at least rayon level.&#13;
&#13;
(iii) Strengthening Health SystemResponse Capacity Sub-Component&#13;
&#13;
95.      Social Distancing Measures. The most effective measure to prevent contracting avian&#13;
influenza would be to limit, as much as possible, contact of suspect cases or people from infected&#13;
areas with the general public. This sub-component would finance development o f a detailed&#13;
implementation plan for so-called "social distancing" measures to be activated in case o f an&#13;
epidemic and backed up with a well-designed communication action plan and materials. Social&#13;
distancing measures would typically be activated on advice fi-om healthprofessionals/institutions,&#13;
though these would not be the enforcing group. The implementation plan would, therefore,&#13;
explicitly define institutional responsibilities for activation and enforcement o f social distancing&#13;
measures and for inter-agency and inter-ministerial coordination. Support would be provided for&#13;
the review and/or preparation of statutory provisions regarding quarantine laws and how they&#13;
apply in a public health emergency, laws and procedures for closing businesses or schools and&#13;
suspendingpublic meetings during a declared state o f emergency; medical volunteer licensure,&#13;
liability, and compensation for retired and non-medical volunteers and workman's compensation&#13;
laws as they apply to health care workers and other essential workers who have taken anti-viral&#13;
drugs for prophylaxis. Training would be provided to "enforcers" such as the police and military&#13;
insafe, efficient implementationof social distancing measuresinways that do not invoke panic.&#13;
Additional preventive actions that would complement social distancing (such as personalhygiene&#13;
promotion through various communication channels, including hand-washing and proper&#13;
cooking, and distribution and use ofmasks) would also be supported.&#13;
&#13;
96.       Vaccination and Drug.Therapy. This sub-component would help launch and expand&#13;
regular seasonal flu vaccination as a vital step to prevent an outbreak among humans, buildingon&#13;
the existing immunization system in Tajikistan rather than establishng a parallel system.          It&#13;
would finance the development of a detailed lopstical (procurement and distribution) plan for&#13;
mass vaccination should an AI vaccine become available.             In case of an avian influenza&#13;
pandemic, when a vaccine becomes available, funding would also be made available for&#13;
implementing an influenza vaccination program that rapidly administers vaccine to priority&#13;
groups and monitors vaccine effectiveness and safety. The targeted priority groups would be&#13;
selected on the basis o f several factors: (i)    risk o f occupational infectious/transmission (e.g.,&#13;
health care workers); (ii) the responsibilities o f certain occupations inproviding essential public&#13;
health safety services; (iii)impact of the circulating pandemic virus on various age groups; and&#13;
(iv) heightenedrisks for personswith specific conditions.&#13;
&#13;
97.       When a pandemic first strikes, vaccine will likely not be ready for distribution. The&#13;
therapeutic use of anti-viral drugs would be part o f the strategy to contain an avian influenza&#13;
pandemic and to reduce morbidity and mortality. However, the availability o f influenza antiviral&#13;
medicationsi s limited and production cannot be rapidly expanded. Therefore, planningby health&#13;
agencies is needed to assure effective use of available drugs. To this end, support would be&#13;
provided for developing guidelines and educating physicians, nurses, and other health personnel&#13;
before and during the pandemic to promote effective use o f these drugs. Governments and&#13;
international agencies, suchas WHO, are stockpiling anti-viral drugs. Support would be provided&#13;
for the purchase and distribution o f anti-viral drugs in accordance with WHO guidelines to avoid&#13;
inappropriate use, to limit the development of antiviral resistance and ensure that this limited&#13;
resource i s used effectively. Support would also be provided to monitor patient compliance with&#13;
treatment regimes and the onset o fresistance to anti-viral drugs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   30&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
98.     Given the current worldwide shortage o f the drug and the limited stock available to the&#13;
countries, priority would be given to population groups most exposed to immediate risk. Taking&#13;
into account the situation observed today, the project would support the use ofthe anti-viral drugs&#13;
for: (i)post-exposure - at an early stage, when isolated cases or small outbreaks are occurring,&#13;
anti-viral drugs can be given to persons known to have been inclose and unprotectedcontact with&#13;
suspected or confirmed cases, and workers at risk o f occupational exposure; and (ii)     treatment -&#13;
insymptomatic patientssuspected ofhavingavianinfluenza.&#13;
&#13;
99.     Medical Services.      In coordination with the ongoing interventions financed by donor&#13;
agencies, equipment, supplies, technical assistance and training would be provided to the health&#13;
care system for preparedness planning to provide optimal medical care and maintain essential&#13;
community services. To this end, support would be provided for establishrnentlrenovation of&#13;
specialized hospital AI referral units in selected four geographical parts o f the country.&#13;
Equipment for these units would include ventilators, monitors, and respirators, and personal&#13;
protection equipment. Guidelines would also be developed for increasing bed availability in case&#13;
of a pandemic through more stringent triage for admission and earlier discharge with follow-up&#13;
by home health care personnel. Assistance would be provided for the development and/or&#13;
updating o f treatment guidelines and hospital infection control guidelines and measures, building&#13;
antibiotic stocks and other drugs for optimal medical care, mobilization of additional health&#13;
personnel, training of health personnel, and provision o f equipment, drugs, vaccines, and other&#13;
medical inputs.&#13;
&#13;
IV.     ImplementationSupport andMonitoringandEvaluation Component&#13;
[SeeAppendix 4for details]&#13;
&#13;
 100.   This component will include two subcomponents:&#13;
&#13;
                 Coordinatingthe day to day implementation of theproject, particularly with&#13;
                 regardto procurementand financial management.&#13;
&#13;
                 Monitoring and evaluation sub-component would support capacities and&#13;
                 activities at all administrative levels, and will develop an action plan for&#13;
                 monitoring and evaluation. This action plan will include baseline studies,&#13;
                 ongoing participatorymonitoring and evaluation, and a final project evaluation.&#13;
                 Specific surveys may be conducted to obtain data for this purpose. Project&#13;
                 evaluation will include both quantitative and qualitative aspects and be conducted&#13;
                 on a yearly basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
101.     Early detection and reporting as well as rapidresponse depend critically on the incentives&#13;
for poultry owners to report quickly any sick and dead poultry to their veterinarians. Without&#13;
adequate compensation arrangements in place, poultry owners have no incentive to do so. The&#13;
project will, therefore, support the establishment of a compensation fund to facilitate culling and&#13;
elimination o f infected and at-risk poultry. No compensation payments will be made from the&#13;
fund until satisfactory operating procedures have been finalized. These procedures will include&#13;
the funds' management arrangements, eligibility criteria, payment arrangements and the flow of&#13;
funds. The Compensation Fund will be financed by an IDA grant o f $0.8 million exclusively&#13;
earmarked for HPAI outbreaks. It will be a condition of disbursement for this subcomponent that&#13;
the modalities for operating the Fundhave been established andhave been approvedbyIDA.&#13;
&#13;
102.     The information below briefly describes broad contours for the Compensation Fund's&#13;
operational procedures. However, a separate Compensation Fund Operational Manual will be&#13;
elaborated, which will contain detailed legal, institutional and operational information and&#13;
procedures, including various forms (e.g. Owner's Culling Certificate, Village Poultry Culling&#13;
Record, Village Culling Summary Report, Enterprise Poultry Culling Record, etc.), as well as&#13;
instructions for OperationalControls, Reviews and Audits. Thesemeasures are intended to curb&#13;
possible misappropriation of the compensationfunds and to ensure that the grantfunds are used&#13;
for the intendedpurpose and directed to the intended beneJiciaries.&#13;
&#13;
Culling&#13;
&#13;
 103.    The project will provide the technical and logistical means to contain an PIA outbreak&#13;
through location quarantining and culling of the affected animals and those in the surrounding&#13;
riskarea. Cullingand carcassdisposal willbe done underthe supervisionofthe StateVeterinary&#13;
Department (SVD) or o f SVD-contracted private veterinarians. Appropriate equipment and&#13;
materials will be provided for efficient and humane animal culling as well as for the safe disposal&#13;
of carcasses and contaminated materials!' Protective clothing and other gear will be procured and&#13;
kept in ready supply, to be issued to all staff and workers involved in containing an outbreak.&#13;
Accurate lists will be kept of all animals culled, so as to provide the basis for subsequent&#13;
 compensation to their owners.&#13;
&#13;
Village andBackyardPoultryCulling&#13;
&#13;
 104.    For village and backyard poultry operations, the culling will be done inthe presence and&#13;
 under the technical and social supervision of a small local ad-hoc committee, the Community&#13;
 Culling Supervision Committee (CCSC). The CCSC will comprise o f one official from a rayon&#13;
 administration, the rayon SVD veterinarian and two respected members o f the village community&#13;
 (of which one at least should be a woman), and two Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO)&#13;
 representatives. The CCSC will verify the number o f birds culled and their owners, so as to&#13;
 ensure a correct count and full transparency for subsequent compensation payments.&#13;
&#13;
 105.    At the time o f culling, each individual poultry owner will receive a culling certificate&#13;
 noting the date and the type and number of hisher birds culled. Each certificate will be signed by&#13;
 all the members o f the CCSC and countersigned by the poultry owner. The certificate will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 32&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
completed in four copies. One copy will be retained by the poultry owner, one copy will be&#13;
submitted to the SVD, the third copy will be sent to rayon administration and the last copy will be&#13;
submitted to PMU. The signed copy will be the basis for payment to farmers. Certificates not&#13;
signedby all CCSC members and the poultry owner will be declared invalid.&#13;
&#13;
106.     Based on the individual poultry owner certificates, the CCSC will then compile a&#13;
summary record of the culling inthe village. Blank pre-numbered villagepoultry culling records&#13;
will be provided to the rayon administration by the Compensation Fund; the numbers will be&#13;
stored in the Compensation Fund's database. The village summary culling record will be the&#13;
official record that establishes the poultry owner's right to compensation from the Compensation&#13;
Fund.&#13;
&#13;
107.     The rayon administration will compile a Summary Report on the basis of all village&#13;
summary poultry culling records, listing all villages and for each village the total number o f&#13;
different poultry culled. Blank pre-numbered Rayon Summary Report forms will be provided to&#13;
the rayon administration by the Compensation Fund; the numbers will be stored in the&#13;
CompensationFund's database.&#13;
&#13;
108.     Payments will be done through the money transfers in local currency through Tajik&#13;
Amanathbank o f the rayon (TAB) to the poultry owner upon submission o f the individual's&#13;
culling certificate. TAB will be the agent bank for PMU to disburse compensation money. TAB&#13;
has been selected because it has branches in every rayon in the country and has experience o f&#13;
disbursing one-time privatization grants to small households under the World Bank Farm&#13;
Privatization Support Project. This arrangement was effective in transferring small amounts o f&#13;
money to rural households, and its checks andbalances were adequate.&#13;
&#13;
109.     TAB Rayonbranchwill: (i) an account and deposit the amount received from PMU&#13;
                                       open&#13;
into the savings books o f the designated recipient within seven days from the date o f the release&#13;
o f the compensation funds by the PMU; (ii)    submit the list o f accounts and amounts deposited&#13;
and dates o f deposit to PMU and to the Director o f SVD. PMU will provide the Government and&#13;
IDA with periodic reports on the status o f the provision o f grants in the reporting format as&#13;
agreed with IDA.&#13;
&#13;
CommercialPoultryCulling&#13;
&#13;
110.     At commercial poultry enterprises or large producers, the culling will be done in the&#13;
presence o f the owner, by the CCSC team. All will sign a culling certificate in four copies. One&#13;
copy will be retained by the poultry producer, one copy will be submitted to the SVD, the third&#13;
copy will be sent to the rayon administration, and the last copy will be submitted to PMU. In&#13;
addition, an audit firm acceptable to IDA will be required to monitor the culling and to certify the&#13;
culling report and culling payments. Compensation amounts will be paid through TAB through&#13;
wire transfers. The certificates will be pre-numbered.&#13;
&#13;
CompensationFormula&#13;
&#13;
111.     For smallholders (owning upto 200 birds), payment per bird will be at 75% o f the market&#13;
price o f laying hens as reported by the competent rayon authority duringthe preceding the month&#13;
inwhich culling took placeor (ii) ofthe average price duringthe previousyear, adjusted for&#13;
                                    75%&#13;
inflation. For poultry owners/producers with more than 200 birds, compensation will be based&#13;
on a reasonable replacement cost - ie., for birds less than 3 months old at the cost o f one-day&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                33&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
chicks, and for birds older than 3 months at the cost o f 3-months-old birds, as reported by the&#13;
competent rayon authority duringthe preceding month inwhich the culling took place.&#13;
&#13;
Role of TajikAmanathbank (TAB)&#13;
&#13;
112.    TAB will function as an agent bank for PMUunder an agency agreement. Thus, will not&#13;
take the foreign exchange risks, which will be borne by Government. The main functions o f TAB&#13;
as an agent bank will be to disburse the compensation amount to the farmers. This would consist&#13;
of: (i)opening a savings account in the rayon branch closest and convenient to the&#13;
householdfarm family receiving the grant; (ii)      transferring the compensation amount to the&#13;
eligible individuals within 7 (seven) calendar days upon notification by the PMU; and malung&#13;
available to the farm family household as and when demanded; (iii)         providing a list o f the&#13;
recipient o f the compensation along with the account number to the Project Management Unit as&#13;
stipulated in the agency agreement; and (iv) maintaining proper accounts, and separate from its&#13;
own accounts, which would be subject to audit at least once a year by an auditor acceptable to&#13;
IDA. TAB shall receive a consolidated fee from the PMU not exceeding 2% o f the disbursed&#13;
amounts fi-om project funds by the PMU. This fee structure will be subject to review by PMU at&#13;
the end o f the first year and revised, as needed, in consultation with IDA. Signing an agency&#13;
agreement between the PMU and TAB shall be disbursement condition the Compensation Fund.&#13;
&#13;
FormsandDatabase&#13;
&#13;
All forms will be provided by the Compensation Fund. They will be printedinbooklets and will&#13;
be pre-numbered. The Fund will maintain a data base containing, inter alia, the numbers o f all&#13;
forms provided to each CCSC. All unused forms, as well as any invalid or incorrectly completed&#13;
forms, must be returnedto the Compensation Fundwhen the culling records are submitted.&#13;
&#13;
The Compensation Fund will establish and maintain a database to facilitate record keeping,&#13;
monitoring and auditing. This database will include all communities. It will also include all&#13;
commercial poultry enterprises or large producers. As mandatory culling orders are issued, the&#13;
affected communities will be tagged accordingly. Once culling reports are received from CCSC,&#13;
the information from the Rayon Summary Reports and the attached VCCSC Summary Culling&#13;
Lists will be entered into the database. The database will also contain a record o f all pre-&#13;
numbered forms provided to CCSC, so as to allow subsequent cross-checking o f forms submitted          1&#13;
&#13;
or returned.&#13;
&#13;
DisputeResolution&#13;
&#13;
 113,   Incaseofdisputesconcerningthe amountofgrant, eligbilitycriteria, procedures, or any&#13;
other concerns, the households /farm families shall have the right to appeal to the PMU, who shall&#13;
make a final decision within seven calendar days from the date o f appeal to the PMU, and convey&#13;
the further step that would be adopted for the resolution o f the dispute.&#13;

Project Benefits&#13;
&#13;
114.     The continuing outbreaks of the H5N1 strain of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza&#13;
(HPAI) that began inlate 2003 and early 2004 have been disastrous for the poultry industryin&#13;
the world. By mid-2005, more than 140 million birds had died or had been destroyed, and&#13;
losses to the poultry industry world-wide are estimated to be in the excess o f US$10 billion.&#13;
Despite control measures, the disease continues to spread, raising serious public health&#13;
concerns at the global and national levels, and has the potential for massive impact on human&#13;
and animal health as well as an extensive socio-economic impact, especially on the poorest.&#13;
&#13;
115.     The analysis considers virus transmission among animals only. Although more than&#13;
half o f the registered 120 human cases globally so far have been fatal, at present HPAI i s&#13;
mainly an animal health problem. Therefore, and due to the difficulties in making justifiable&#13;
assumptions and quantification, the analysis doesn't examine economic consequences of&#13;
human-to-humantransmission.&#13;
&#13;
116.      Inaddition to human and animal health concerns, significant socio-economic damage&#13;
could be caused to the countryby an AI epidemic. Though it i s difficult to estimate exactly the&#13;
full extent of the damage, the preliminary estimates can be done by consideringthe estimated&#13;
contribution o f the poultry sector to the country's GDP.        Based on statistical data, the&#13;
estimated value-added by the poultry sector in 2004 was around TJS 19million, or about&#13;
0.8 % o f the agncultural GDP (TJS 2,260 million real AgGDP in 2004). Domestic production&#13;
was estimated at around 2 thousand tons o f meat and 77.7 million of eggs. Poultry imports&#13;
were valued at around US$ 15 million in 2004 and comprised 5.8 thousand tons o f meat and&#13;
63.3 million o f eggs.&#13;
&#13;
117.      Another way to assess the cost of an AI epidemic i s to estimate the direct loss in&#13;
poultry capital. At present, there are about 2.3 million birds reported in Tajikistan. If the&#13;
whole poultry stock i s culled, with an average farm gate price of a birdbefore AI o f TJS 6, the&#13;
gross value of poultry lost during the crisis would come to some TJS 14 million. Taking no&#13;
further actions would result in the loss o f a large share o f the indigenous poultry stock in&#13;
Tajikistan.&#13;
&#13;
118.     Today in Tajihstan about 70% o f poultry are owned by households. Therefore, the&#13;
majority of poultry production in Tajikistan derives from smallholder production and&#13;
represents, inparticular for the poorerrural households, a significant income source and source&#13;
o f protein. Given that the majority o f poultry i s raised in backyard farming, loses per poor&#13;
household are estimated at US$60-80 through abandoning poultry meat and egg production.&#13;
The loss of this food and income source can therefore be considered substantial.&#13;
&#13;
119.      The poor would also suffer as a result o f absence of poultry meat and eggs in the&#13;
market followed by an increase inthe price o f substitute products duringthis period. Although,&#13;
there i s a highprobability that redmeat production would be advanced, and that prices for the&#13;
substitute products could return to the pre AI-level, the possibilities of shortages and further&#13;
pricejumps should not be excluded. Poultry meat and eggs comprise a significant component&#13;
&#13;
                                                 35&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
o f the aggregate food basket; the ability o f the poorest share o f population to diversify through&#13;
other substitute products is extremely limited.&#13;
&#13;
120.     Inthe event of a larger outbreak, culling would comprise a significant expenditure to&#13;
the Government to pay for temporary labor for culling and clean-up crews, overtime police and&#13;
other officials inthe rural areas, and for transportation and purchase o f imported materials. In&#13;
addition, the essential compensation scheme to respond inthe event o f an outbreak comprises&#13;
an additional cost to Government. These costs can be kept low through early detection and&#13;
immediate action o fthe relevant authorities to contain the outbreak to a limited area.&#13;
&#13;
Indirect costs&#13;
&#13;
121.     In case of animal-to-human and human-to-human transmissions, there would be&#13;
expenses to be undertaken by the health sector, such as cost o f hospitalization, etc. Cost o f&#13;
injections to humans and birds should be also taken into account. It is assumed that health&#13;
disabilities would lead to the loss o f labor force, and hence there would be loss to the overall&#13;
economic activity.&#13;
&#13;
122.     The loss o f tax revenues through the almost complete standstill o f poultry products&#13;
imported into the country amounts to around US$3 million with a potential impact on&#13;
financing o fpublic services.&#13;
&#13;
Economic Analysis of theProject&#13;
&#13;
 123.    Inresponse to these concerns, Tajikistan has prepared a National Action Plan, to be&#13;
supported by the project. The project will have a three-tiered approach: (i)       public awareness&#13;
and information, (ii)  animal health, (iii) health, and (iv) implementation support and&#13;
                                            human&#13;
monitoring and evaluation. The objective o f this analysis i s the estimation o f the economic&#13;
benefits from the implementation o f the proposed activities relative to the estimated cost o f the&#13;
project (cost-benefit analysis). The standard practice o f comparing the incremental stream o f&#13;
net benefits `with project' to a `without project' scenario was applied. The incremental benefits&#13;
and costs o f the project were evaluated for a period o f 15 years, with a discount rate 12&#13;
percent. The calculation takes into account the losses in the poultry market, gains o f other&#13;
meat sectors, and loss o f capital in the poultry sector. In the with project scenario a 30%&#13;
reduction in the likelihood o f a larger outbreak was assumed. The analysis considered all&#13;
projects costs, but does not consider monthly monitoring costs o f the state veterinary services.&#13;
However, given that these costs are rather low for Government, they are assumed not to have a&#13;
 significant impact on the project returns. GDP values and statistical data for 2004 were used.&#13;
An exchange rate o f TJS 2.97/USD was applied for currency conversion (average for 2004).&#13;
The following table summarizes base case assumptions on the key parameters:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   36&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
124.    Without Proiect. The main costs to the economy o fmultiple, simultaneous outbreaks that&#13;
cannot be controlled properly due to insufficient public and private sector capacity i s defined as&#13;
the net cost incurred from a significant decrease in demand for poultry products, including meat&#13;
and eggs. The net cost represents cost to the poultry sector and the positive impact on alternative&#13;
protein sources, inparticular the red meat sub-sector.&#13;
&#13;
(i)      Itis assumed that inthe year o fthe catastrophic event, the impact on the poultry sector is&#13;
         a 60% decrease inthe value added o f meat and egg production. This assumption is based&#13;
         on the observations in other countries with regard to price and demand reductions after&#13;
         outbreaks. Inthe subsequent three years, the value added inthe poultry sector i s assumed&#13;
         to regain 60% o fthe pre- catastrophic event level.&#13;
(ii)     A further, one-time cost to the poultry sector occurs in the form o f abandoned capital&#13;
         production assets as a result of the permanent decrease in demand and poultry stock that&#13;
         has to be culled inresponse to the outbreaks. This loss is estimated at 40% of the capital&#13;
         stock. The value o f the poultry sector capital stock itself i s assumed to be equal to three&#13;
         times the value o f annual production in the poultry sector. The assumption has been&#13;
         based on the strong reaction o f the poultry sector inother countries to the potential threat&#13;
         o f an outbreak.&#13;
(iii)    Gains to the red meat sub-sector which i s an alternative source o f protein to a limited&#13;
         number o f the population and i s therefore assumed to be 10% o f the value added in the&#13;
         year in which the catastrophic event occurs, gradually decreasing to 5% over the&#13;
         following 3 years.&#13;
&#13;
125.     The Government and the private sector would also incur incremental costs associated&#13;
with the administration ofmonitoring and containingoutbreaks. However, these costs are difficult&#13;
to estimate and are therefore not included in the analysis. As mentioned previously, there i s a&#13;
significant loss o f consumer incomes resulting from the perceived risk associated with poultry&#13;
product consumption. Lack o f data makes it problematical to quantify this loss. However, as&#13;
discussed above the impact on the poorer segment o f the population can be assumed to be even&#13;
higher.&#13;
&#13;
 126.    The stream o f total costs due to a catastrophic event is calculated in the form o f present&#13;
value. This value is then multiplied with the probability o f the catastrophic event occurring in a&#13;
particular year to arrive at the expected loss in that year. In the without project scenario, the&#13;
probability o f the catastrophic event occurring i s assumed to be 15% in year 1, increasing&#13;
annually at a rate o f 1.O% due to increasing presence o f the virus inthe environment. This process&#13;
results inan increase inthe expected costs for the analyzed period o f 15 years, as presented inthe&#13;
table below.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
127.    With Project. It was presumed that the impact o f the project would be fully observed in&#13;
year 4 after project start. Therefore, the probability o f the full impact o f a catastrophic event is&#13;
assumed to be the same as under the without project scenario for the first three project years.&#13;
From year 4, the likelihood o f a catastrophic outbreak i s assumed to reduce by 30%. The stream&#13;
o f expected costs i s also calculated by multiplying the above Net Present Value with these&#13;
probabilities and presented in the table above. The total project costs are estimated at US$ 5&#13;
million disbursed over three years.&#13;
&#13;
Results of the Analysis&#13;
&#13;
128.    Based on the above assumptions, the analysis derives at an Net Present Value o f&#13;
US$ 3.1 million and an internalrate o freturn o f 21.3%.&#13;
&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
&#13;
129.    A sensitivity analysis was carriedout to analyze the impact o fvarying assumptions on the&#13;
results o f internalrate o freturn o f the project:&#13;
&#13;
      0    Holding all other values constant, assuming a reduction o f capital loss in the poultry&#13;
           sector o f 20% (as opposed to the base case 40%) - results in an Internal Rate of Return&#13;
           o f 6%.&#13;
      0    Holding all other values constant, assuming a value added loss in the poultry sector to&#13;
           50% in the catastrophic event year and 20% in the long term (as opposed to the base&#13;
           values) results inan InternalRate o f Return o f 1%.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
130.    The Project will be implemented by line agencies o f the governmental institutions and&#13;
primarily by the Ministry o f Agriculture - State Veterinary Department; Ministry o f Health;&#13;
Ministry of Emergency Situations and Civil Defense and Academy of Science, Academy of&#13;
Agncultural     Science.  However,     other  governmental    agencies   and  non-governmental&#13;
organizations and service providers (e.g., the Rural Advisory Service, private veterinarians,&#13;
NGOs both national and international, community-based organizations, etc.) will all be involved&#13;
inavariety offunctions.&#13;
&#13;
131,    Projectmanagement:The project management is designed as a three tier administrative&#13;
system: (i) National level Steering Committee at the highest level; (ii) Management Unit&#13;
                                                                       Project&#13;
(PMU) for day to day functions o f Project Coordination; and (iii) Points and their teams in&#13;
                                                                  Focal&#13;
line agencies, who are directly responsible for day to day Project Implementation. These project&#13;
management arrangements will be contained ina Project Operational Manual satisfactory to IDA,&#13;
whose preparationi s a Condition of Effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
132.    National Steering Committee. Given the national importance and cross-sectoral nature o f&#13;
this Avian Influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response Project, overall&#13;
responsibility for overseeing and coordinating institutional and implementation arrangements at&#13;
the national level will be vested with a National Steering Committee (NSC) chaired by a Deputy&#13;
Prime Minister. Other members o f the NSC will include representatives from MOH, MOA,&#13;
Veterinary Department, MOESCD, Academy of Sciences, Academy o f Agricultural Sciences,&#13;
MOF, Aid Coordination Unit,Ministryo f Education, and Ministry o f Communications and other&#13;
agencies as deemed necessary. NSC will be responsible for ensuring coordination and linkages&#13;
across relevant Ministries and Agencies and for guiding and monitoring the implementation o f&#13;
the project at the national level. NSC would also be responsible for reviewing and approving the&#13;
work program and budget, initially biannually during the first year o f the project and&#13;
subsequently annually inorder to ensure overall successful project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
133.    Project Management Unit (PMU). The PMU will be responsible for: (i)                overall&#13;
coordination o f project implementation which i s carried out by the line agencies; (ii)&#13;
procurement, disbursement, accounts, audit, monitoring and evaluation, and reporting; (iii)acting&#13;
as a secretariat to the NSC, including convening the meetings and following up on the decisions&#13;
made; (iv) interactingregularly with the Donor community working inTajilustan; (v) organizing&#13;
national awareness seminars and national press briefs for updates on the avian influenza; (vi)&#13;
submitting quarterly financial monitoring reports and progress reports on project implementation&#13;
status to the Government, Aid Coordination Unit, and IDA; (vii) consolidating the annual Work&#13;
Programs (WPs) and budgets for submission to the implementing agencies, and IDA.&#13;
&#13;
 134.   The project will use the existing PMUcurrently responsible for the implementation o f the&#13;
Rural Infiastructure Rehabilitation and Community Agriculture and Watershed Management&#13;
Projects. The key advantage offered by this choice is the fact that the staff i s already familiar&#13;
with managing a World Bank funded project, which would allow for a quick start to project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
&#13;
 135.   The P M U already has a Director, a Procurement Specialist, a Financial Management&#13;
Specialist, and support staff (secretaries, drivers, etc.).A Communication Specialist will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                39&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
added to the team. Given the demands imposed by the emergency nature o f the operation (with&#13;
front-loaded procurement and disbursement), as well as the presence o f a compensation fund, this&#13;
PMU staff strength will be augmented with a limited-term procurement consultant for the initial&#13;
months o f project implementation. An Assistant to the Chief Accountant and a Compensation&#13;
FundAdministrator will also be recruited and both shall stay on the team for the entire duration&#13;
of project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
136.     Project Teams for Day-to-Day Project Implementation.         Day-to-day implementation&#13;
will be carried out by various Government Agencies. Each Agency will have a focal point who&#13;
will lead the team responsible for all project activities implemented by that agency. A high&#13;
ranking person of the rank not lower that a Head o f Department would lead the teams. This focal&#13;
point will assist the PMU director in coordinating the respective agencies component or sub-&#13;
component. The person will coordinate and oversee the implementation o f project component&#13;
activities within the respective agency as well as its subordinate/associated institutions up to the&#13;
grassroots level.    The person will also be responsible for coordinating with other relevant&#13;
government agencies and departments so as to ensure effective inter-agency collaboration. The&#13;
person will be responsible for the preparation o f Annual Work Programs and Budgets for the&#13;
respective agency, as well as for providing inputsto the quarterly and annual progress reports and&#13;
financial monitoring reports to the PMU. The person will be assisted by staff and, as necessary,&#13;
consultants who will support the planning and implementation o f activities as well as M&amp;E o f&#13;
project activities.&#13;
&#13;
137.     At the oblast, rayon and Jamoat levels, (Municipalities, Micro-rayon andMohalla level in&#13;
Urban areas) implementation will be the direct responsibility o f the respective oblast and rayon&#13;
agencies. Small inter-agency coordination units will have to be managed by the general Oblast&#13;
and Rayon level Hukumats as establishedby the NormalAdministrative mechanism ineffect, and&#13;
is closely monitored by the respective focal persons through their respective Oblast and Rayon&#13;
technical arms who work under the supervision and guidance o f the Local Government.&#13;
&#13;
Implementation Arrangements by Component&#13;
&#13;
 138.    The Public Awareness and Information Component cuts across multiple agencies, with&#13;
 some aspects o f it falling under MOH, other aspects under the State Veterinary Department, with&#13;
yet other aspects (e.g. policy advocacy and support to the government for crisis communication&#13;
management) not falling under any one particular agency. Inorder to avoid overlaps and ensure a&#13;
 cohesive communication strategy, this component will be overseen by a Communication&#13;
 Specialist in the Project Implementation Unit who will be responsible for its overall coordination&#13;
as well as for crisis communication.&#13;
&#13;
 139.    The Animal Health Component will be implemented by: (i)the State Veterinary&#13;
Department which will be responsible for planning and coordination o f the animal aspects o f the&#13;
AI response, as well as for poultry surveillance and outbreak containment; (ii)the Institute of&#13;
Zoology and Parasitology with be responsible for wild bird surveillance; and (iii)     the Foot and&#13;
MouthDisease Institute will be responsible for conducting laboratory diagnostics.&#13;
&#13;
 140.    The Human Health Component will be implemented by: (i)MOH's Sanitary and&#13;
 Epidemiological Surveillance Department for matters related to planning and coordination, field&#13;
 surveillance, and laboratory diagnostics; and (ii)&#13;
                                                  MOH's Medical Services Departmentwhich will&#13;
 also participate in planning and coordination, in addition to being responsible for treatment&#13;
 response.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 40&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
141.    In case of declared influenza pandemic, MOESCD would, by law, take charge for&#13;
coordinating all emergency response activities. Consequently, MOESCD will closely work with&#13;
other agencies participating in the project to ensure an effective response in case o f an&#13;
emergency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Role of Specialized International Organizations&#13;
&#13;
142.    First, this is an Emergency project that will be implemented at a rapid pace in order to&#13;
pre-empt the AI threat that has already been cited inneighboring countries. Second, the project i s&#13;
dealing with a threat that i s new to the country, where there is limited past experience on how to&#13;
deal with it. Third, the multiple agencies involved in the project have limited planning and&#13;
implementation capacity.       Consequently, the project will work very closely with technical&#13;
agencies that have a well-established experience in dealing with similar disease outbreaks&#13;
elsewhere. In particular, within the UN family, UNICEF has the global mandate for Public&#13;
Awareness/Communication regarding AI, as does WHO regarding the human health dimensions&#13;
of AI, and FA0 regarding animal health dimensions. As noted earlier, these three agencies are&#13;
already assisting Government inrefining its Preparedness Plan.&#13;
&#13;
143.    It is anticipated that these technical agencies will continue to offer this support during&#13;
project implementation. Specifically, it i s envisaged that UNICEF will enter into contract with&#13;
the Government to manage the Communication Component. UNICEF has successfully&#13;
implemented similar communication programs in Tajikistan and, on the issue of AI, has shown&#13;
readiness to help the Government design and implement a communication program addressed to&#13;
specific target audiences (veterinarians, farmers, healthworkers, decision-makers, etc.) as well as&#13;
to the public at large.    Similarly it is expected that WHO will enter into contract with the&#13;
Government to manage the Technical Assistance aspects o f the Human Health component.&#13;
&#13;
144.    The capacity o f the two UNagencies to provide this kind o f assistance has been assessed&#13;
and found satisfactory. Moreover, these two agencies will co-finance the Public Awareness and&#13;
Information Component (UNICEF) and the Human Health Component (WHO), largely through&#13;
absorbing the overhead costs associated with managing these activities, but also financing some&#13;
surveys and some o f the capacity building activities.          The agency for assisting in the&#13;
implementation o f the Animal Health component will be identified during the project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
&#13;
Inter-Agency Coordination Framework&#13;
&#13;
145.     In order to foster collaboration among the various agencies, there shall be an Inter-&#13;
Agency Working Group consisting o f all the focal personal at each implementing agency, as well&#13;
as representatives o f the International Technical Agencies, and the Director o f the PMU. The&#13;
purpose o f such a forum is to create an opportunity for information sharing to ensure synergy&#13;
among the various components. This Inter-Agency Working Group will meet at least once a&#13;
month, or at such other greater frequency, particularly inthe early months of the project, in order&#13;
to ensure effective collaboration. It will be chairedby the PMUDirector.&#13;

respective agencies, namely IDA for US$5.0 million, UNICEF for $0.2 million, and WHO for&#13;
$0.1 million. However, the project needs at least US$6.8 million for effective surveillance and&#13;
readiness incase of an AI outbreak. This financing gap i s expected to be covered from the AHIE&#13;
to the tune o f $1.5 million when this trust becomes operational, which i s expected to happen by&#13;
the end o f June 2006. An application i s beingpreparedto that effect.&#13;

Introduction&#13;
&#13;
147.    Procurement under the Project will be carried out in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
"Guidelines:  Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated M a y 2004, and&#13;
"Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated M a y&#13;
2004, and with the provisions stipulated in the Financing Agreement. Agreements covering&#13;
procurement methods, thresholds, and other conditionality will be consistent with the OP 8.50-&#13;
Emergency Recovery Assistance and determined for the Republic o f Tajilustan according to its&#13;
capacity and experience with Bankprocurement.&#13;
&#13;
148.    The activities covered under the Project will be implemented on the basis o f annual work&#13;
plans to allow for needed flexibility in adjusting activities to account for in-country experience&#13;
and the lessons from implementation by other countries participating in the multi-country GPAI.&#13;
Accordingly, the following approach to procurementwill be adopted.&#13;
&#13;
149.    Implementing Agency Assessment. All procurementunder the project will be carried out&#13;
by the Project ImplementationUnitthat currently manages the Rural InfrastructureRehabilitation&#13;
and Community Agnculture and Watershed Management Projects. Procurement staff in the&#13;
PMU is experienced with procurement following World Bank guidelines, including with all the&#13;
procurementmethods to be includedunder the Project. Procurement under the ongoing the RIRP&#13;
and CAWDP has worked well. The same qualified staff will be responsible for procurement&#13;
under this Project. However, given the country conditions, the Project has been classified in&#13;
category "C", signifying high risk (where A i s l o w risk, B i s medium risk, and C is high risk).&#13;
The annual procurement plan will define thresholds for prior review appropriate to the category;&#13;
these thresholds will be determined so as to minimize prior review as appropriate to the level o f&#13;
risk.&#13;
&#13;

       ,&#13;
&#13;
The project may face the following potentialrisks duringimplementation:&#13;
&#13;
            There i s lack o f transparency in conducting the procurement in accordance with the&#13;
            current procurement regulations which creates possibilities for corruption, collusion&#13;

151. Recommendations&#13;
&#13;
Action Plan to strengthen the PMU capacity: Based on the analysis made, the following actions&#13;
are recommended:&#13;
&#13;
    0    To provide higher transparency o f the project implementation it would be recommended&#13;
         to create the project website or use the official website o f the MOA to publishthe project&#13;
         implementation data - advertisements, funding proposals, contract awards, the progress&#13;
         reports from the implementing entities there or inanother publicly accessible website. All&#13;
         the consulting contracts costing above US$lOO,OOO,       ICB and NCB contracts for goods&#13;
          and works shall be published in the UNDB and DgMarket also in accordance with the&#13;
         Bank Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
         Procurement Consultant shall be hired to help the GKS to implement the procurement&#13;
         under the Bank`s Guidelines, particularly at the beginningo f the project.&#13;
&#13;
     0    The Bank should organize a one day project launch workshop, including a detailed&#13;
          explanation o f the procurement requirements, for the staff o f the MOA, MOH and MOC,&#13;
          who shall coordinate the appropriate components.&#13;
&#13;
     0    The PMU should prepare an inventory o f suppliers o f the required goods, construction&#13;
          contractors and consultants (firms and individuals, as well as an inventory o f the&#13;
          available goods in the remote regions). This will help to determine the suppliers and&#13;
          expedite procurement.&#13;
&#13;
     0    The Bank staff will review the efficiency o f procurement arrangements under the project&#13;
          after six months from the date o f the grant effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
152.      Procurement Plan. A procurement plan covering the initial twelve-month period o f&#13;
project implementation has been prepared. The updated procurement plan for each subsequent&#13;
year will be submitted to the Bank for approval before the end o f the previous year and will use a&#13;
pre-defined   standard format which will, as a minimum, list: (i)  goods and services to be procured&#13;
duringthe following calendar year, (ii) value; (iii) method of procurement; and (iv) the&#13;
                                          their               the&#13;
timetable for carrying out the procurement. At the time o f approving the annual work program,&#13;
IDAwill agree on the consistency with the applicationo fthe Bank procurement guidelines to the&#13;
specific procurement lots expected duringthe year and their methods o f procurement. Ifneeded,&#13;
the plan will be revised and re-submitted.&#13;
&#13;
153.      Procurement Methods and Thresholds.              The Financing Agreement defines the&#13;
appropriate methods for International Competitive Bidding(ICB), National Competitive Bidding&#13;
(NCB), Limited International Bidding (LIB), or Shopping in accordance with the OP 8.50-&#13;
Emergency Recovery Assessment guidelines. Thresholds for project procurement methods and&#13;
prior review requirements have been indicatedbelow on the basis of the Bank's assessment o f the&#13;
capacity of the PMUwhich will be responsible for procurement, the estimated risks o f corruption&#13;
inthe country, andthe country's capacity ofconstructionandmanufacturingindustries.&#13;

&#13;
154.    Prior Review by the Bank. The procurement plan shall set forth those contracts which&#13;
shall be subject to the Bank's prior review process. All other contracts shall be subject to post&#13;
review. One infive contracts will be post reviewed.&#13;
&#13;
155.    Advertisement. The General Procurement Notice (GPN) shall be published inthe on-line&#13;

&#13;
156.    The PMU will follow the Bank's anti-conuption measures and will not engage services&#13;
of firms and individuals debarred by the Bank. The listing o f debarred firms and individuals is&#13;
locatedat: http://www.worldbank.ordhtml/opr/procure/debarr.html&#13;
&#13;
157.    UNAgencies as Procurement Agents. For several years, a number o f specialized UN&#13;
and bilateral agencies operating in the Region have supported various country agencies in the&#13;
procurement o f drugs, vaccines, specialized test equipment and supplies, and other materials.&#13;
Using this type o f assistance will be part o f the Project's procurement arrangements.        In&#13;
accordance with the Procurement Guidelines Section 3.9, the Project will include the use of&#13;
Specialized Agencies o f the United Nations (WHO, FA0 and UNICEF) as suppliers o f goods&#13;
(mainly for drugs and vaccines and some medical supplies such as reagents), following their own&#13;
procedures o f procurement. In addition, it i s foreseen under the Project to use the UNDP as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                46&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
procurement agent. The use o f UN Agencies as agents will have to meet the requirements o f&#13;
Sections 3.10 and 3.15 o f the Procurement Guidelines. The procurement agents will follow the&#13;
Bank's Procurement Guidelines under the standard agreement between the Bank and the&#13;
respective agency.&#13;
&#13;
158.      Procurement under EmergencyAssistance Provisions. FollowingEmergency Recovery&#13;
Assistance procedures, the Project i s likely to include financing for items included on a positive&#13;
list o f imports identified as necessary under a well-defined preparedness and response program to&#13;
be prepared as part o f project implementation. Incase o f a declared global influenza pandemic,&#13;
which will trigger disbursement conditions for critical imports, support will be provided under the&#13;
Project for the procurement o f a positive list o f critical imports. These may be procured under&#13;
Modified International Competitive Bidding (MICB), according to paragraphs 2.66 and 2.67 o f&#13;
the Procurement Guidelines. Also, commonly traded commodities may be procured through&#13;
organized international commodity markets or other channels o f competitive procurement&#13;
acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
159.      The positive list o f critical inputsto be prepared by the Government of Tajikistan or to be&#13;
purchased by the Borrower from the private sector, based on historical imports during national&#13;
emergencies, will include:&#13;
          0  Pharmaceuticals and vaccines&#13;
          0  Medical and veterinary supplies and equipment&#13;
          0   Communication equipment, supplies, and public awareness campaigns&#13;
          0  Food and water containers&#13;
          0  Protectiveclothing and gear&#13;
&#13;
160.      Disbursements for items procured under emergency assistance provisions can be made&#13;
for up to 100 percent of import costs. No more than 20 percent o f the Grant proceeds may be&#13;
used for retroactive financing of expenditures, and the payments must have been made after the&#13;
appraisal mission.&#13;
&#13;
 161.     Procurement Audits. The Bank shall conduct biannual supervision mission o f the&#13;
project and conduct the regular post review o f the appropriate contracts concluded by that time.&#13;
Because the Project has a strong element o f decentralized implementation, and to help IDA carry&#13;
out post-reviews of procurement actions, consultants will be contracted (as a cost to the Project)&#13;
to carry out annual procurement audits o f a sample o f contracts, under Terms o f Reference&#13;
acceptable to the Bank&#13;

B. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
162.    On M a y 27 2006, financial management arrangements for the proposedAI Project were&#13;
assessed to determine whether the financial management capacity of the implementing agency,&#13;
PMU for RlRP and CAWMP, are acceptable to the Bank. The assessment also evaluated PMU&#13;
financial management system (FMS) in terms o f its readiness for the implementation o f the&#13;
proposedproject.&#13;
&#13;
Conclusion.&#13;
&#13;
163.    Taking into consideration the assessment o f the financial management systems and&#13;
processes and the assessment o f risks and mitigating measures, the financial management&#13;
arrangements for the proposed AI Project are capable o f satisfactorily recording all transactions&#13;
and balances, supporting the preparationo f regular andreliable financial statements, safeguarding&#13;
the Project assets, and are subject to auditing arrangements acceptable to the Bank. Systems and&#13;
procedures to be established for compensation fund, as broadly outlined in Appendix 3b, will be&#13;
reviewed when ready and will be subject to a disbursement condition.&#13;
&#13;
Country Issues&#13;
&#13;
164.    Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) for Tajikistan was completed in&#13;
2003. The conclusion o f the CFAA is that there i s a highrisk to public funds due to extremely&#13;
weak public sector financial management including budgeting, accounting and auditing. C F A A&#13;
notes that the system o f public accountability functions poorly and there i s a lack o f transparency&#13;
at all levels o f government. While legislative reforms have been introduced in the Treasury,&#13;
budget processes and control agencies are undermined due to human and technological capacity&#13;
constraints. Some of the main risks include fragmented budgets, poor cash management and&#13;
execution control, lack o f transparency in the operations o f State Owned Enterprises and&#13;
inadequate checks and balances in the Executive and Legislature. These risks affect the overall&#13;
quality and credibility o f governance inTajikistan.&#13;
&#13;
A summary ofthe riskratings is as follows:&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
165.    The PMU will be responsible for coordination and for financial management under the&#13;
2roject. It will beresponsible for ensuringthat the Project establishes and maintains: (i) adequate&#13;
accounting systems and procedures; (ii)flow-of-funds mechanisms facilitating timely&#13;
disbursement of funds and timely payments for goods, works and services; (iii) reporting&#13;
                                                                                    regular&#13;
on the use of funds; and (iv) appropriate arrangements for regular financial audits.         These&#13;
responsibilities will be described indetail ina manual o f financial procedures and summarized in&#13;
the Financing Agreement. The PMU has experience with financial management under Bank-&#13;
financed projects and has established sound internal control mechanisms on the application and&#13;
use o f funds.     However, additional internal control procedures for the operation o f the&#13;
Compensation Fund, consistent will the internal control procedures will be developed to respond&#13;
to the specific risks associatedwith the flow-of-funds mechanismenvisaged under the project.&#13;
&#13;
StrengthsandWeaknesses.&#13;
&#13;
166.    P M U experience in the implementation o f the existing projects and a good accounting&#13;
system supported by well maintained accounting software are major strengths o f the&#13;
implementing agency. The closure of the existing RIR Project, Development of Project&#13;
Operational Manual, including procedures for Compensation Fund, controlling Compensation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  49&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Fund effectively and the coordination o f different line ministries and agencies involved in&#13;
implementation are main challenges that needto be managed by PMU.&#13;
&#13;
167.     Financial ManagementAction Plan. Financial management arrangements of the PMU&#13;
are generally adequate, but a number o f actions are required to ensure that arrangements are fully&#13;
satisfactory for the project, with its specific financial management needs, especially with respect&#13;
to the Compensation Fund. The following action plan was discussed with the Recipient during&#13;
Negotiations.    Satisfactory implementation of the action plan will ensure the establishment of a&#13;
financial management system that fully meets requirements of the Project and of the Bank.&#13;

&#13;
Budgeting&#13;
&#13;
168.     Annual budgetingprocess will be coordinated by Chief Accountant. He/She will needto&#13;
liaise with all project component coordinators in respective line ministries/agencies and collect&#13;
initial budget proposals for the planning period. The Chief Accountant will then consolidate&#13;
project expenditure categories by components after discussions with appropriate line ministries&#13;
and agencies. The consolidated budget, after its approval by the NSC, will then be agreed with&#13;
the Bank before the start of the financial year of the PMU. The format and content of the annual&#13;
budgetreports will be agreedwiththe Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Accountingsystem&#13;
&#13;
169.     Accounts and records for the project will be maintained by PMUwhich will operate and&#13;
maintain a financial management system (FMS) capable o f generating Interim Un-audited&#13;
Financial Reports(IFR, formerly "financial monitoringreports") inaccordance with formats to be&#13;
agreed with the World Bank. The Chief Accountant will be responsible for overall project&#13;
financial  management, maintenance of books and accounts for the project, preparation and&#13;
dissemination o f financial statements and IFR, and timely audits o f the project. The Chief&#13;
Accountant will be supported by a local consultant for up to one year from project effectiveness&#13;
to manage workload during existing RIR project closure and AI project initial phase when&#13;
activities for prevention and preparation for outbreak undertaken. Funds will be transferred from&#13;
the Designated accounts to pay for eligible expenditures in accordance with instructions&#13;
contained in the Disbursement letter to be issued upon loan approval. The P M U will also&#13;
maintain appropriate financial records and reports in accordance with existing government&#13;
financial regulations and project specific procedures established in the Project Implementation&#13;
Plan.&#13;
&#13;
Accountingpoliciesand Procedures&#13;
&#13;
 170.    Existing PIP i s based on old Bank policies and procedures and needs to be updated&#13;
significantly to take into account current local and Bank policies and Procedures. Therefore,&#13;
Project Operational Manual which will describe procedures on internal controls, Government&#13;
Accounting Policies and Procedures, budgetingand Budgetary control, DisbursementProcedures,&#13;
Travel Procedures, accounting system Payroll, FixedAssets, Financial Reporting, Internal Audit,&#13;
External Audit will be developed and agreed with the Bank instead of updating current PIP. The&#13;
completion of development o f the Project Operational Manual i s expected before actual start of&#13;
the implementation andit iscapacity buildingactivity rather than FMcondition.&#13;
&#13;
Information system&#13;
&#13;
 171.    I C accounting software that was installed to record and report existing project activities&#13;
has been well maintained and used for recording and reporting project financial activities.&#13;
Upgrading of Computerized accounting software i s required in order to cope with proposed AI&#13;
project needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 51&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
172.     Staffing. The Project will be implemented by the existing P M U RIRP and CAWMP.&#13;
This PMU also has a qualified financial management specialists for both projects under&#13;
implementation. Experiencedfinance team of the RIR project consisted of Chief Accountant and&#13;
cashier will be responsiblefor financial management arrangements of the proposed A I project.&#13;
However, due to the emergency nature o f the new project, with front-loaded procurement and the&#13;
attendant financial management requirements, the finance team could be overwhelmed in the&#13;
initial months of project implementation. Additionally, it i s expected that existing RIR project&#13;
will be closed during the period when AI project will have its active phase o f implementation.&#13;
Consequently, an local financial management consultant will be hired for up to one year to&#13;
support the FM team o f the AI Project. Hisher recruitment i s a condition of effectiveness. In&#13;
addition, a compensation fund administrator will also be hired to conduct periodic visits to the&#13;
village level to review the implementation of the Compensation Fund and would report to the&#13;
Chief Accountant. Similarly, hisher condition i s a condition o f effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
173.     Financial Reporting. For project monitoring purposes, quarterly interim un-audited&#13;
financial reports (IFRs) (previously called financial monitoring reports) will be required. The&#13;
PMUwill be responsible for designing appropriate IFRs to include: (a) Project Sources and Uses&#13;
of Funds, (b) Uses o f Funds by Project Activity, (c) Special Account/Local Bank Account&#13;
Statements, (d) Physical progress report, and (e) Procurement report. These financial reports will&#13;
be submitted to IDA within 45 days o f the end o f each quarter. The first quarterly IFRs will be&#13;
submitted after the end o f the first full quarter following the initial disbursement. Formats o f the&#13;
annual financial statements and the IFRs will be incorporated in the Project Operational Manual.&#13;
The accounting software currently used by the PMU will need to be upgraded to have the&#13;
capacity to prepare FRs incorporating all components, sub-components and expenditure&#13;
categories, as may be appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
 174.    Disbursement and Funds Flow Arrangements.                  The Recipient will establish a&#13;
Designated Account with a ceiling o f US$ 350,000 in a commercial bank, acceptable to IDA.&#13;
Disbursements from the IDA Grant will follow the transaction-based method, i.e., traditional&#13;
Bank procedures: Statements o f Expenditure (SOEs), Direct Payments, Special Commitments.&#13;
For certain payments, above the minimumapplication size o f US$50,000 equivalent as specified&#13;
in the Disbursement Letter, the PMU will submit withdrawal applications to the IDA for&#13;
payments to suppliers and consultants directly from the Grant Account. The PMU Chief&#13;
Accountant will ensure completeness and accuracy o f all withdrawal applications and will append&#13;
herhis signature as part o f the internal control procedures additionally to MOF representative or&#13;
PMU Director's signature. Procedures for the withdrawal o f grant funds are described in the&#13;
Disbursement Letter; all supporting documentation evidencing project expenditure will be&#13;
retained by the PMU for up to 2 years after the receipt o f the final audit o f the project and to&#13;
make these available for audit and supervision.&#13;
&#13;
 175.    Quick Disbursable Funds. Inthe event o f a global influenza pandemic, the Recipient&#13;
could obtain quick disbursing funds. These funds would be disbursed against a positive list o f&#13;
imports, identified as critical following emergency events.           The declaration o f a national&#13;
 emergency will be a disbursement condition for this element o f the project. Upon declaration o f&#13;
 an emergency, the Government will submit to IDA an initial recovery plan documenting the&#13;
 disaster declaration, the related budget appropriation and the proposed use o f the funds. The&#13;
PMU will keep IDA informed o f updates in the recovery plan as the emergency response&#13;
 operations unfold.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    52&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
176.    Internal Controls. With the exception o f the Compensation Fund component, for which&#13;
the PMU does not have previous experience, the P M U has maintained an effective internal&#13;
control system to ensure that project expenditures are properly authorized, supporting documents&#13;
are maintained; accounts are reconciled periodically; project assets, including cash, are&#13;
safeguarded, and cash compensation grants are properly accounted for.             Although project&#13;
accountingwill be on a cashbasis, detailed assethnventoriesregister will be maintained as part of&#13;
the project internal control procedures. The PMU will implement appropriate controls over&#13;
inventories o f drugs, vaccines, medical equipment, and other sensitive and/or expensive assets&#13;
will be especially important for the project.       One o f the strengths in the internal control&#13;
arrangements for this project i s that the contracts will be executed at the line ministriedagencies&#13;
level whereas payments will take place at the PMU level, where the invoices will be checked&#13;
independently.        Respective line ministries and government agencies responsible for&#13;
implementation o f the project components will submit reviewed and approved payment&#13;
documents to PMUfor further processing and final payment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
177.    Compensation Fund. The Government will establish a national Compensation Fund&#13;
from which the owners o f animals culled will be compensated (see Annex 3b).          The necessary&#13;
legal, institutional and operational details will be developed and agreed upon during the first&#13;
months o fproject implementation and will be includedinthe Operational Plan.&#13;
&#13;
178.    As a condition of disbursemento f funds under the Compensation Fund sub-component,&#13;
the PMU will implement appropriate internal control procedures and flow-of-funds arrangements&#13;
acceptable to the Bank and documented in the operational/financial manual. The Project will&#13;
provide US$O.S million to finance and operate this Fund. US$lOO,OOO will be disbursed into a&#13;
specially established account, so as to provide sufficient resources for immediate needs. The&#13;
remaining US$0.7 million will be retained as a contingency and will be disbursed only in the&#13;
event o f actual need.&#13;
&#13;
 179.   Internal Control Arrangements for the CompensationFund. Annex 3b sets forth the&#13;
procedures for recording poultry culled under government orders and for establishing and&#13;
recording poultry owner's claims for compensation payments. A number o f minimum internal&#13;
control procedures and risk mitigation measures will be implemented with respect to recording&#13;
and verifying poultry culling and claims for compensation payment before any flow o f funds i s&#13;
initiated.&#13;
     0  The financial and operational manuals will detail the internal control mechanisms, as&#13;
         described in Annex 3b, for identifying those eligble for compensation payments,&#13;
         ensuring that there will be no multiple claims. A Compensation Fund database will be&#13;
        maintained by the Project to facilitate record keeping, claim verification, payment&#13;
         facilitation, monitoring and auditing.&#13;
     0   Inthe event ofgovernment-ordered culling ofpoultry, the cullingand the preparationand&#13;
        processing o f culling records and compensation claims will be done in accordance with&#13;
        the procedures detailed inAnnex 3b.&#13;
     0  All forms to be usedto recordpoultry culling and compensation claims will providedby&#13;
         the Project. They will be pre-numbered and recordedinthe database of the Compensation&#13;
        Fund. All unused forms, as well as any invalid or incorrectly completed forms, must be&#13;
        returned to the Compensation Fund when the culling records are submitted. In addition,&#13;
         an audit firm acceptable to IDA will be required to monitor the culling for commercial&#13;
         (large scale) poultry farmers and to certify the culling report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 53&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
         'The compensation payments will be done through bank transfers in local currency through&#13;
         Tajik Amanathbank of the rayon (TAB) to the poultry owner upon submission ol' the&#13;
         individual's culling certificate. There will be no voi~chers or animal replacements.&#13;
         Payment will be made within four weeks from the date of culling.&#13;
&#13;
 1 80.   Reviews und Auditsfor !he Compensution Fund. The PMU will carry out, or will arrange&#13;
to have carried out, additional checks to ensure that the eligible poultry owners, and only they, are&#13;
paid and are paid in full. 'This will include, but not be limited to, periodic operational reviews,&#13;
under TORs acceptable to IDA, to confirm the validity and legitimacy of the compensation&#13;
payments made. The reviewers will be required to verify compensation claims and payments made&#13;
in randomly selected samples o f this verification will include: checking against the database&#13;
maintained by the Compensation Fund, collecting and verifying information available and obtained&#13;
at the village level, checking with individual poultry owners, checking forms and reports, etc. Any&#13;
significant weaknesses identified will be promptly rectified in close consultation with IDA. In&#13;
addition, the external independent auditors will be asked to provide an opinion on the&#13;
reasonablenesso f the accounting, reporting and internal controls in respect of the operations of the&#13;
Compensation Fund, and the audit TORs (acceptable to IDA) will include these specific&#13;
requirements. All ineligible claims will be refunded to the Compensation Fund and to IDA. Such a&#13;
requirement for operational reviews is included in the Compensation Procedures Manual.&#13;
&#13;
 181.    Financial Audits. There will be annual audits of the project financial statements, covering&#13;
all aspects o f the project, including specific requirements for the Compensation Fund. 'l'he audits&#13;
will be performed by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and in accordance with&#13;
International Standards on Auditing (ISA), and the Bank's guidelines on auditing as stated in the&#13;
guidelines: Annual Financial Reporting and Auditing for fl'orld Bank-financed Activities (June&#13;
2003). The auditors' TOR will be prepared by the PMU and cleared by the Hank before the&#13;
engagement of the auditor. They wiII include both the audit of financial transactions, an assessment&#13;
of the internal control, funds flow mechanisms, and the reasonableness of the accounting, reporting&#13;
and internal controls in respect of the Compensation Fund. The annual audit reports will consist of&#13;
a single opinion on the financial statements of the project, incorporating the project accounts,&#13;
including Special Account Reconciliation, and SOE Withdrawal Schedule, as well as a&#13;
Management Letter. The audit reports will be submitted to the Bank not later than six months after&#13;
the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. The cost of the audits will be eligible for financing&#13;
from the Grant. The PMU will provide the auditor with full access to project-related documents&#13;
and records, including the compensation claims database, and with the information required for thc&#13;
purpose of the audit. Sample TORs for project audit will be included in the Financial Manual.&#13;
&#13;
182.    The current external audit arrangements for the existing RIR project are acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. Clean audit reports together with no single management letter recommendation for the year&#13;
ended December 3 1 .   2004 were sent to the Bank on time. It is expected that clean Audit reports for&#13;
the year ended December 31 2005 will be sent to the Bank for review on time also.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Supervision Plan&#13;
&#13;
183.    The reports o f the progress of the project implementation will be monitored in detail during&#13;
supervision missions. 'The IFRs will be reviewed on a regular basis by the field-based FMS and the&#13;
results or issues followed up during supervision missions. Annual audited project financial&#13;
statements and management letters will be reviewed and issues identified will be followed up with&#13;
PMU.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
184.   The FM supervision missions will include a review o f the project's financial management&#13;
and disbursement arrangements (and may include a review o f a sample o f SOEs and movements&#13;
on the Designated accounts for each funding source) to ensure compliance with the Bank's&#13;
minimumrequirements. Itis envisagedthat the FMsupervision missions will be carried out every&#13;
six months.&#13;

&#13;
185.    Activities under the Project are not expected to generate significant adverse&#13;
environmental effects as they are focused largely on public sector capacity buildingand improved&#13;
readiness for dealing with outbreaks o f avian influenza in domestic poultry and human health.&#13;
These prevention-focused activities are expected to have a positive environmental impact as the&#13;
Project's investments in facilities, equipment, and training for laboratories will improve the&#13;
effectiveness and safety over existing avian influenza handling and testing procedures by meeting&#13;
international standards establishedby the WHO and OIE.&#13;
186.    There are two environment-related issues that the project will address: the procedures put&#13;
in place for culling and disposal of poultry; and the handling o f medical waste generated by&#13;
laboratories and health care facilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Culling and disposal of poultry:&#13;
&#13;
187.    The environmental considerations for carcass disposal typically have the potential for one&#13;
or more o f the following environmental impacts: health and safety hazards for the workers and&#13;
the public; soil and water pollution from leakages o f the carcass waste; excavation o f materials&#13;
and disposal o f surplus soil/earth and other materials, risks to environmentally sensitive areas,&#13;
flora and fauna; vicinity o f the disposal site to the busy areas like national road, health centers,&#13;
markets, schools or natural reserves or historic sites; site location (avoiding flooded, eroded or&#13;
slidingareas).&#13;
&#13;
Handling of medical waste:&#13;
&#13;
188.    Impacts associated with the handling o f medical waste can be minor but still it is&#13;
particularly important that wastes generated are addressed duringproject implementation and also&#13;
monitored duringoperation.&#13;
&#13;
Mitigation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
189.    These potential hazards will be avoided by employing international best practice&#13;
guidelines in the culling and disposal o f carcasses and handling o f medical waste. Mitigation&#13;
measures will include: i)careful citing, alignment and timing o f works; ii)the careful selection of&#13;
disposal areas and methods iii)protection o f sensitive areas within or close to the site and&#13;
incorporation o f safety and environmental requirements in contract documents; iv) immediately&#13;
halting work in vicinity o f discoveries, pending instructions from relevant authorities; v)&#13;
providing appropriate drainage and soil stabilization.&#13;
190.     Since the Project supports investments in carcass disposal for culled poultry and&#13;
investments in laboratories and hospitals it receives a B category for environmental screening.&#13;
The Project Operations Manual (a condition o f effectiveness) will include an environmental&#13;

              arrangements to deal with adverse environmental impacts from prevention and&#13;
              control activities;&#13;
&#13;
         (ii) Strengthening of Veterinary services. Training o f veterinary workers to include:&#13;
              procedures for safe handling o f AI materials and construction and refurbishing o f&#13;

         (iii)Safe   culling and transport of infected and at-risk birds: The current policy in the&#13;
              management o f AI outbreaks i s stamping out by imposing a quarantine area,&#13;
               slaughter o f infected and potentially exposed birds, and decontamination o f poultry&#13;
              houses, sheds and contaminated areas. Improper transport o f contaminated birds, bird&#13;
              products or waste (eggs, manure and feathers) and equipment (for example in open&#13;
               containers) may pose environmental and public healthrisks; and&#13;
&#13;
         (iv)Safe disposal of carcasses. A practical and sanitary system for disposing o f dead&#13;
              birdswill help prevent the spread o f disease andprotect air and water quality. Within&#13;
               the limits set by the local regulatory agencies, each country project may select the&#13;
               disposal method(s) that best fits its needs.&#13;

 192.     The main project beneficiaries are smallholder poultry owners, most o f whom live in&#13;
 rural areas and who are the most threatened by an HPAI outbreak.                            Such families are&#13;
 disproportionately likely to be inthe lower income category. An estimated 65% o f people living&#13;
 in rural areas are below the poverty line (US$2.15 PPP). In addition, poultry is mainly looked&#13;
 after by women and children. The project public awareness and information will particularly&#13;
 target these groups.&#13;

 193.     The missionmet with a broadrange ofstakeholders and discussed different aspects ofthe&#13;
 project with them.          The most critical issue arising from these consultations relates to&#13;
 compensation mechanisms for owners of culled poultry, should that occur.                          In this regard&#13;
 arrangements, a compensation procedures manual, with adequate safeguards will be developed&#13;
 through a consultative process prior to disbursement o fthe compensation funds.&#13;

evaluation. Beneficiaries will be members o f the Community Culling Supervision Committees.&#13;
Each committee will comprise o f one official from a rayon administration, a veterinarianand two&#13;
respected members of the village community (of which one at least should be a woman), and two&#13;

            Tajikistan - Avian Influenza Control and
            Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Avian Influenza Control and Human
            Pandemic Preparedness and Response Project for Tajikistan
            aims to minimize the threat posed to humans by the Highly
            Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) infection and other
            zoonoses, and to prepare for, control, and respond to
            influenza pandemics and other infectious disease emergencies
            in humans. There are four project components: 1) public
            awareness and information: this component supports the
            development of a communication program aimed at minimizing
            the risk of an avian influenza outbreak and its spread, by
            ensuring that citizens understand the threat, and are aware
            of the symptoms, with a view to influencing their behaviors
            in order to protect themselves and their community; 2)
            animal health: this component provides support for
            prevention, control and total eradication of HPAI through:
            (a) enhancing planning and coordination capability for HPAI
            prevention in the poultry population; (b) strengthening
            field disease surveillance and laboratory diagnostic
            capacity; and (c) strengthening HPAI outbreak containment
            plans. (i) National Steering Committee (NSC) with the
            composition and terms of reference satisfactory to the
            association has been established by the recipient; and (ii)
            project implementation coordinators have been designated in
            the Ministry of Health, Veterinary Department; 3) human
            health: this component provides support for reducing the
            impact of a pandemic influenza virus through: (a) enhancing
            public health program planning and coordination; (b)
            strengthening of national public health surveillance
            systems; and (c) strengthening the health care system's
            response capacity; and 4) implementation support and
            monitoring and evaluation: this component supports the
            coordination and management of the planned activities,
            including arrangements for financial management,
            procurement, and monitoring and evaluation.
