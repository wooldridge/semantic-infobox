Using Capital Markets to Develop Private&#13;
Catastrophe Insurance                                      19928&#13;
John D. Pollener    The global catastrophe insurance market exhibits inherent cyclical risks. Disaster-prone countries can&#13;
improve their protection against catastrophic risk and premium volatility by using capital markets to&#13;
boost the capacity of the private sector to absorb and spread the risks-both domestically and&#13;
internationally. This Note proposes two mechanisms for more efficient management of catastrophic&#13;
risk: pooled insurance coverage supported by liquidity and credit enhancement facilities, and hazard-&#13;
indexed bonds to securitize risk. Support from multilateral development institutions can play a&#13;
catalytic role in the development of these mechanisms while still preserving actuarially fair premiums.&#13;
Some small countries may require multilateral support (a credit enhancement) to gain access to&#13;
capital markets. Or perhaps all that is needed is for the government and local industry to recognize&#13;
that the new mechanisms can both increase cover and stabilize premiums. Such an assessment&#13;
requires scarce financial modeling skills-something multilaterals can help organize and finance.&#13;

Using Capital Markets to Develop Private Catastrophe Insurance&#13;
Reinsurance prices are quoted as "rates on line." Assume, for example, that a&#13;
primary insurance company wishes to purchase reinsurance for catastrophic&#13;
losses between US$15 million and US$25 million. If losses in a catastrophe are&#13;
less than US$15 million, the company retains all the loss. This ceiling is referred&#13;
to as the retention level. If the loss is more than US$15 million, the reinsurer pays  Transferring risks abhroad also means that because&#13;

            The global catastrophe insurance market
            exhibits inherent cyclical risks. Disaster-prone countries
            can improve their protection against catastrophic risk and
            premium volatility by using capital markets to boost the
            capacity of the private sector to absorb and spread the
            risks -- both domestically and internationally. This Note
            proposes two mechanisms for more efficient management of
            catastrophic risk: pooled insurance coverage supported by
            liquidity and credit enhancement facilities, and
            hazard-indexed bonds to securitize risk.
