WORLD BANK&#13;
Staff Working Paper No. 502&#13;
November 1981&#13;
THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING&#13;
In recent years many developing countries have considered or taken&#13;
steps to develop or expand national merchant marines to serve their foreign&#13;
trades. The purpose of this paper is to consider whether and under what&#13;
circumstances developing countries can benefit from investments in interna-&#13;
tional shipping.&#13;
In recent years, much has been said and written to encourage develop-&#13;
-.ng countries to invest in national shipping lines to carry their foreign&#13;
trade. In examining the issue, tne paper finds no overwhelming evidence&#13;
either favouring or arguing against such investment.&#13;
International shipping is capital intensive and can be risky and&#13;
highly competitive. Investments are more likely to be beneficial for coun-&#13;
tries with a tradition in shipping and with appropriate institutions, where&#13;
there is also potential for industrial linkages and hence expansion of related&#13;
industries, prospects of substantial net foreign exchange savings or earnings&#13;
for shipping activity, and for the ability to develop new trading volumes,&#13;
routes or partners by removing service constraints. The existence and&#13;
strength of these factors must be tested in the context of overall economic&#13;
transport needs and priorities, taking into account the possibilities for&#13;
improving both inland and shipping technologies through such investment.&#13;

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS&#13;
Most of the research and data collection for this paper was under-&#13;
taken in 1978 and 1979. In the preparation of the paper I have berefitted&#13;
greatly form the collaboration of Bern-hard Abrahamsson (consultant) who&#13;
participated in the field mission to India and Korea and who commented con-&#13;
structively on an earlier draft of the paper. I have also greatly benefitted&#13;
from frequent discussions with George Bain and A.J. Carmichael as well as from&#13;
criticism and discussions with many other colleagues, including, in particuiar&#13;
Kathleen di Tullio, Mahbub ul Haq, Vincent Hogg, Winston King, Ernst Lutz,&#13;
Alan Walters and Christopher Willoughby. However, they are in no way respon-&#13;
sible for any of the shortcomings of this paper.&#13;

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS&#13;
1.   Introduction&#13;
i.        Efficient low-cost transport by ocean shipping is of major importance&#13;
to all partners in world trade. It is particularly important for developing&#13;
countries as they seek to raise their levels of production and consumption by&#13;
opening new markets and sources of supply. The purpose of this paper is to&#13;
consider whether, and under what circumstances, developing countries (LDrs) 1/&#13;
can benefit from investments in international shipping. The paper was p e-&#13;
pared as a desk study complemented by visits to India and Korea. In this&#13;
paper the term "shipping" refers only to ocean-going goods transport and&#13;
excludes river or inland waterways transport and coastal/interisland transport&#13;
since these are part of domestic transport systems. Nor does it include the&#13;
specialized, limited market of passenger cruise shipping.&#13;
ii.       It is opportune to examine the question of international shipping&#13;
and the LDC-s for several reasons. These include the major changes in shipping&#13;
technology and institutional arrangements in recent years; the deteriorating&#13;
balance of payments situation of many LDCs which is generating a growing&#13;
general preoccupation with foreign trade, including intra-LDC trade; and the&#13;
adoption of resolutions, in a variety of forums, requesting the international&#13;
financing institutions (IFIs) to consider increased lending for the sector.&#13;

iii.      Through June 30, 1979 the World Bank had lent directly or indirectly&#13;
(in the form of DFC on-lending) about US$340 million for the acquisition of&#13;
ocean-going vessels and related technical assistance. This represents about&#13;
0.5% of total cumulative World Bank/IDA lending. It includes about US$102&#13;
million in rehabilitation loans to the Netherlands and Norway in the late&#13;
1940s/early 1950s; US$&amp;3 million to India (tankers); and US$16 million to&#13;
Turkey (ro/ro vessels) as part of two agricultural loans. The balance con-&#13;
sists of on-lending by development finance companies for ship acquisition to&#13;
India, Indonesia, Korea, Morocco, the Philippines, Tanzania and Thailand.&#13;
During the period FY75-FY79, World Bank lending for shipping amounted to&#13;
US$115 million, with all but US$10 million being indirect DFC on-lending. The&#13;
average DFC sub-loan was US$3.0 million and was mainly for the acquisition of&#13;
individual second-hand vessels, principally bulk, rather than for new&#13;
buildings.&#13;
1/   The term LDCs as used in this paper is somewhat more restictive than&#13;
that used in the World Development Report 1979. It excludes the middle&#13;
income developing countries of Greece, Portugal, Spain and Turkey. In&#13;
addition, when referring to the fleets of LDCs, the tonnages registered&#13;
in the so-called "open registry countries" of Cyprus, Liberia, Oman,&#13;
Panama, Singapore Pad Somalia are excluded. As in the case of the World&#13;
Development Report, it excludes the capital surplus oil exporters of&#13;
Kuwait, Libya, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the Uniited Arab Emirates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3.   The Shipping Scene&#13;
iv.       Shipping is directly affected by two main trends.   One is the&#13;
development of trade and the other concerns technological and institutional&#13;
developments in the two main sub-sectors of the industry, viz. regularly-&#13;
scheduled general cargo liner services and bulk cargo non-scheduled shipping&#13;
of minerals, grains, petroleum and similar products. The major technological&#13;
developments which have taken place in the shipping industrv in recent years&#13;
include the development of cargo unitization (pallets, containers, etc.) in&#13;
general cargo liner shipping, a great increase in the size of bulk vessels&#13;
used in long distance and large volume trades and the greater use of increas-&#13;
ingly more specialized vessels such as LNG carriers. A further development&#13;
has been the trend towards automation and reduced crews, particularly on the&#13;
vessels of developed market economy countries. While these developments have&#13;
reduced, or at least restrained, increases in the cost per unit of cargo&#13;
transported, they have also meant greatly increased acquisition cost for more&#13;
specialized vessels such as container ships, LNG or LPG carriers, large oil&#13;
tankers, etc.&#13;
v.        During the 1960s and 1970s a major change was the increased LDC&#13;
governmental interest in the sector. This is reflected in various resolutions&#13;
of UNCTAD and other international bodies; the adoption of the Convention on a&#13;
Code of Conduct for Liner Conferences in 1974 (this has not yet entered into&#13;
force); and the growth of government-owned or controlled shipping companies in&#13;
some non-market industrial economies (NIEs) including the Soviet Union, as&#13;
well as in LDCs. In bulk shipping, institutional developments include a&#13;
growing use of contract affreightment and pooling arrangements. There has&#13;
also been a rapid growth in open registry shipping, but there has been&#13;
considerable discussion recently about the desirability of "flags of conve-&#13;
nience". Proposals have been made by UNCTAD and the LDCs for gradually&#13;
phasing out open registry shipping on the alleged grounds that vessels are&#13;
less safe, crews are paid less, loss and damage claims are difficult to&#13;
recover, etc.&#13;
vi.       Particular developing countries, as well as the LDCs as a group,&#13;
have paid a great deal of attention to shipping policy and practices in&#13;
recent years by sponsoring resolutions within a variety of international&#13;
forums. They have also invested in ships, particularly liner vessels, to&#13;
serve a multiplicity of economic, political and strategic objectives, with&#13;
the relative importance of each varying from case to case. LDSs have shown&#13;
an increased awareness of their dependence on foreign-owned shipping and a&#13;
growing belief that by carrying a significant share of their international&#13;
trade in national flag vessels, they could save scarce foreign exchange,&#13;
reduce freight costs, obtain new markets and generally facilitate their&#13;
foreign trade, including that with other LDCs. The right of the LDCs to&#13;
membership of liner shipping conferences serving the trade of their coun-&#13;
tries, and the need for greater conference/user consultations have long been&#13;
recognized and often implemented. More recently, increased attention has&#13;
been given to cargo 6haring, as reflected in the Code of Conduct for Liner&#13;
Conferences and Resolution 120 V of UNCTAD V (June 1979), and to bulk&#13;
shipping. Other resolutions have dealt with the important question of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
availability and terms of ship financing since ships are capital-intensive&#13;
assets with relatively long lives. There have been many specific recommenda-&#13;
tions that the IFIs assist LDCs to acquire new or second-hand ships.&#13;
vii.      The LDCs account for a fairly limited, but increasing, share of the&#13;
world shipping tonnage. In mid-1978 the developed market economy countries,&#13;
accounted for 53% of the total shipping tonnage in terms of dwt, the so-&#13;
called open registry countries for 31%, the LDCs for 8%, the NIEs for 7%, and&#13;
the capital surplus oil exporting countries for 1%. While there was a rapid&#13;
growth in LDC-owned tanker and dry bulk fleets between 1974 and 1978, these&#13;
countries accounted for a larger share of the world liner fleet (15%) than of&#13;
tankers (5%) and dry bulk vessels (8%). The share of LDCs in world shipping&#13;
tonnage was much smaller than their share of world seaborne trade. In 1974,&#13;
the LDCs accounted for about 30% of world seaborne tonnage. Despite the&#13;
increasing number of LDCs that have developed or expanded national merchant&#13;
fleets in recent years, the bulk of their shipping fleet is still concen-&#13;
trated in a limited number of countries, with four countries (India, Brazil,&#13;
Korea and Yugoslavia) accounting for about 43% of the LDC-owned tonnage.&#13;
Vessels owned and operated by LDCs are generally smaller and older than the&#13;
world fleet averages.&#13;
viii.     A range of options is available to a country concerned with the&#13;
maritime transport of its foreign trade. At one extreme it can buy imports on&#13;
a c.i.f. basis and sell exports on f.o.b. basis, thus, in theory, leaving all&#13;
the international shipping arrangements to the trading partrer and giving up&#13;
any control or influence over these arrangemen-s and their costs.   The other&#13;
extreme is to build up a national flag fleet with the capacity to carry most&#13;
of the country's foreign trade as well as to participate in cross-trades&#13;
between third countries. These options are summarized below:&#13;
Types of Shipping Options&#13;
No Shipping Capability                 National Shipping Capability&#13;
a               b              c              d          e           f&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iv -&#13;
The relationship between the trading arrangements used, actual control over&#13;
shipping arrangements and the existence and use of national flag vessels is,&#13;
however, in practice not clear cult. The above simplified presentation may be&#13;
more relevant for LDCs than for developed countries with well established&#13;
trading and shipping arrangements. In the latter case an importer may well&#13;
control the shipping arrangements and, if he so chooses, use a national flag&#13;
vessel even if he is actually buying c.i.f.&#13;
ix.       Conceptually, investment in vessels for use on trade routes to an.'&#13;
from the investing country that are presently served by foreign flag liner or&#13;
bulk vessels can be considered as import substitution. Investment in bulk&#13;
vessels for cross-trading, on the other hand, can be considered as an export&#13;
industry. Similarly, investments in liner vessels to open up new services on&#13;
routes where there is now no service could be considered as an export activity.&#13;
4., Factors in Shipping Investment Decisions&#13;
x.        The basic factors in shipping investment decisions, particularly&#13;
as they apply to developing countries, are a very mixed picture of potentially&#13;
positive and negative features which, of necessity, must be evaluated on a&#13;
case-by-case basis. The essential pre-conditions for considering investment&#13;
in the shipping sector are a satisfactory determination of inter-sectoral&#13;
i-;iorities and detailed project feasibility studies.&#13;
xi.       The main potential benefits that a particular LDC may expect from&#13;
investments in shipping are:&#13;
(a)  net foreign exchange savings on the country's present&#13;
or normal traffic;&#13;
(b)  assistance in the form of value added to the country's&#13;
foreign trade and economy generally through the economic&#13;
activity generated by lower freight rates and/or new,&#13;
better or more secure shipping services and/or better&#13;
export returns on essential bulk commodities;&#13;
(c)  backward and forward linkages with the rest of the economy&#13;
which lead to greater economic diversification and devel-&#13;
opment; and&#13;
(d)  net profits from the shipping operations.  This latter item&#13;
is likely, in fact, to overlap with (a) and care needs be&#13;
taken to avoid double counting.&#13;
These benefits are summarized briefly in the following paragraphs. It should,&#13;
however, be stressed that they may well prove to be negative in particular&#13;
circumstances.&#13;
xii.      Review of the available information indicates that sound investments&#13;
in shipping are likely to result in some net savings of foreign exchange.&#13;
These savings will be greatest where the company can operate profitably and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
where, at least after an initial build-up period, the country can utilize&#13;
domestic rather than foreign shipping resources, e.g., crews, management and&#13;
overhead, insurance, communications, vessel repairs, spare parts and supplies,&#13;
and possibly even locally built ships.&#13;
xiii.     A second potential benefit is the positive effect on the foreign&#13;
trade balance. This can occur through reduced freight rates on existing&#13;
exports/imports, the traffic generation effects of improved, more suitable&#13;
shipping services, or the opening up of new services, e.g., in trades between&#13;
and among LDCs. These benefits will depend on the ability of the national&#13;
line to operate efficiently at competitive rates and the extent to which new&#13;
services are integrated into a coordinated general trade expansion program or&#13;
a specific foreign trade oriented project.&#13;
xiv.      The expectation of profitable shipping operation is a major factor&#13;
influencing some, but not necessarily all, decisions to invest in the industry.&#13;
A review of the limited amount of publicly available information suggests&#13;
that some nationally-owned LDC shipping companies appear to have been profit-&#13;
able. The rapid expansion of some private sector LDC shipping companies in&#13;
recent years suggests a similar experience also. Nevertheless, there is&#13;
sufficient evidence to indicate that several LDC shipping companies either&#13;
have been losing money or earn only marginal returns.&#13;
xv.       The economic benefits from sound investments in shipping and the&#13;
petential for broader development impacts from such investments depend&#13;
significantly on how shipping is integrated with, and contributes to, the&#13;
economic development of the country. Economic linkages depend on the pattern&#13;
of a country's resource allocation and/or the extent to which the national&#13;
fleet draws on domestic industries such as ship-repair yards, marine insur-&#13;
ance, ship finance organizations, ship classification services, marine&#13;
telecommunication services, marine institutes, marine research institutes,&#13;
etc.&#13;
xvi.      There are a number of factors which need careful consideration in&#13;
decisions about shipping investments.   These include:&#13;
(a)  the increasingly capital-intensive nature of many&#13;
types of shipping;&#13;
(b)  the particular riskiness of some sections of the&#13;
industry;&#13;
(c)  the existence in some cases of viable alternatives&#13;
to transporting by owned vessels;&#13;
(d)  the existence of open registry shipping and the fact that&#13;
some developed countries directly or indirectly sub-&#13;
sidize their shipping industries;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- vi -&#13;
(e) competition from the increasing involvement of a&#13;
number of NIEs and of tramp shipping lines in liner&#13;
routes on a non-conference, lower-than-conference-&#13;
freight-rate-basis; and&#13;
(f) protectionism in the industry.&#13;
These factors are discussed briefly below and at length in the paper itself.&#13;
xvii.     Shipping is generally a capital-intensive industry with, at best,&#13;
modest direct employment creation effects. This is particularly true for&#13;
modern vessels such as container ships and large bulk carriers. Unless very&#13;
important backward linkages exist, the number of jobs cre, -ed indirectly may&#13;
also be fairly limited. Capital investment needs, however, may be reduced&#13;
by focusing on the relatively more labor-intensive sectors, by using second-&#13;
hand vessels, by using leased or chartered vessels, or through joint ventures&#13;
with an established shipping line. This latter also offers a way of acquiring&#13;
operational experience and market contacts.&#13;
xviii.    Shipping is a risky business subject to considerable fluctuations&#13;
in demand and, in the case of bulk shipping, to volatility in freight rates.&#13;
The industry is also affected by changes in vessel technology, rapid movements&#13;
in exchange rates, national or international regulations of various kinds&#13;
which can increase costs and a number of other factors. The degree of risk,&#13;
however, varies significantly with the type of shipping and operating pattern&#13;
used. In bulk shipping that is part of an integrated project or under long-&#13;
term charter arrangements, for example, the risks are relatively small. Liner&#13;
shipping in a country's normal bilateral foreign trade is also less risky&#13;
relatively than is cross-trading in liner or bulk trades.&#13;
xix.      Often there are less costly alternatives to investment in shipping&#13;
such as development of a domestic forwarding industry to achieve lower&#13;
transport costs through international door-to-door freight control over cargo&#13;
movements between inland points, strengthened shippers' organizations as a&#13;
means of balancing the powers of shipping conferences and providing a medium&#13;
for commercial consultations, and the long-term chartering or leasing of&#13;
vessels by a national shipping line.&#13;
xx.       The existence of open registry shipping, which often uses crews&#13;
from other LDCs or low-wage developed countries reduces the comparative&#13;
advantage some LDCs might appear to have on account of low crew costs. How-&#13;
ever, th-is could change with the efforts of ITF to raise wage levels on open&#13;
registry vessels and -he efforts of many LDCs and UNCTAD to phase out open&#13;
registries. The practice of some developed countries of assisting their&#13;
shipping industries through direct or indirect subsidies, among other mea-&#13;
sures, may also limit the potential benefits of sound shipping investments to&#13;
individual LDCs by below cost price competition.&#13;
xxi.      The increasing involvement of several NIE shipping lines in general&#13;
cargo liner shipping, often outside the conferences and at lower freight rates,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- vii -&#13;
has the paradoxical effect of promoting trade by lowering transport costs but&#13;
at the same time reducing the potential for profitable operation of LDC ship-&#13;
ping lines.&#13;
xxii.     A difficult factor to assess is the potential trend towards cargo&#13;
sharing and protectionism, as reflected in the Convention on a Code of&#13;
Conduct for Liner Conferences, and the proposals for "equitable participation"&#13;
by LDCs in bulk shipping. While assisting some LDCs to develop their shipping&#13;
industries, these measures could also encourage uneconomic investments, re-&#13;
strict the growth of the fleets of those LDCs that have been more successful&#13;
and competitive, and cause less efficient use of shipping capacity and,&#13;
therefore, tend to increase freight rates.&#13;
xxiii.    In summary, the relatively capital-intensive nature of shipping,&#13;
its riskiness, the uncertainty surrounding its potential benefits and the&#13;
fact that alternatives to the use of national flag vessels are generally&#13;
available, suggest very careful consideration of inter-sectoral investment&#13;
priorities and a proper economic evaluation and feasibility studies before&#13;
new investments are undertaken in the sector. From the national point of&#13;
view, key factors to be considered include: present and prospective trade&#13;
volumes and patterns; the suitability of existing shipping services; the&#13;
potential benefits from institutional improvements and the provision of&#13;
related facilities (e.g., ports); the likely availability of the supporting&#13;
institutional, operational and other facilities required for national flag&#13;
shipping; the borrowing possibilities and other avenues available for ship&#13;
procurement, as well as the potential benefits from alternative investments in&#13;
other sectors. In this connection, it should be borne in mind that shipping&#13;
as an international industry requires an internationally-oriented framework;&#13;
that money may be available from abroad only for the acquisition of new ships&#13;
and then on a tied basis; and that ships are movable assets which can be&#13;
bought, sold and chartered on the international market.&#13;
xxiv.    The following conditions may be helpful in identifying the circum-&#13;
stances where shipping investments might be beneficial:&#13;
(a)  the country has an environment that seems to offer&#13;
comparative advantages in the sector such as a mari-&#13;
time or naval background and resources such as trained&#13;
or partly-trained personnel, an appropriate institu-&#13;
tional framework, and a potential for significant&#13;
backward linkages (eeg. ship supplies, ship building&#13;
and repair services, insurance etc.) and efficient,&#13;
economical operations;&#13;
(b)  the country has substantial volumes of foreign trade,&#13;
preferably with a reasonable balance of imports and&#13;
exports;&#13;
(c)  the country has sufficient capital resources to permit&#13;
it to invest in shipping which is a relatively capital-&#13;
intensive industry or, alternatively, it can obtain&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- viii -&#13;
funds from abroad on reasonable terms either in the&#13;
form of joint ventures or loans;&#13;
(d)  the country has a good potential for new or increased&#13;
foreign trade that is presently being inhibited by the&#13;
cost and/or service limitations of its shipping services,&#13;
including those affecting intra-LDC trade;&#13;
(e)  the vessels and shipping technologies currently being&#13;
used in major trades are not the most economical from a&#13;
total transport and distribution chain point of view;&#13;
(f)  the country is developing a major project which will&#13;
give rise to significant exports or imports where&#13;
tailor-made shipping services may be the most econo-&#13;
mical solution.&#13;
xxv.      These factors and conditions, as well as the potential economic and&#13;
financial returns, would require careful consideration on a case-by-case&#13;
basis. This would also be true for the operation and management capabilities&#13;
and the particular conditions of the trade(s) in question. Hence the impor-&#13;
tance not only of careful consideration of inter-sectoral priorities but also&#13;
of proper feasibility studies before substantial investments, particularly&#13;
public sector investments, are undertaken in international shipping.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
A.   Purpose&#13;
1.01      Efficient, low-cost transport by ocean shipping is of major impor-&#13;
tance in world trade, particularly to the efforts of developing countries&#13;
to raise their level of production and consumption. The purpose of this paper&#13;
is, therefore, to consider whether, and under what circumstances, developing&#13;
countries 1/ (LDCs) can benefit from investment in international shipping 2/.&#13;
There are several reasons why it is opportune to examine this question.&#13;
Major technological and institutional changes have occurred in recent years in&#13;
shipping. LDCs have shown a growing interest in shipping. Several specific&#13;
international resolutions to the effect that the international financial&#13;
institutions (IFIs) should consider increased lending for the sector have&#13;
been passed in various forums. The deteriorating balance of payments of&#13;
a number of countries has focused attention on their foreign trade activities&#13;
and prospects, including the opportunities for South-South trade which is less&#13;
likely to attract financing from ccr- entional sources. This paper first&#13;
discusses these points end then considers the potential benefits and risks to&#13;
individual LDCs from investments in international shipping.&#13;
1.02      This paper is not concerned with river or inland waterways transport,&#13;
coastal shipping or inter-island shipping limited to a particular country or&#13;
with World Bank lending for these sectors. These are considered as elements&#13;
of the domestic transport system of a country and, as such, fall within normal&#13;
consideration for multilateral assistance. It also ignores the fairly limited&#13;
and specialized cruise shipping industry.&#13;
1/   The term developing countries or LDCs as used in this paper differs&#13;
somewhat from that used in the recent World Development Report, 1979.&#13;
The term, particularly any statistical references, as used here does&#13;
not include the following member countries: Greece, Portugal, Spain&#13;
and Turkey. As in the case of the World Development Report, the&#13;
capital surplus oil exporters (Kuwait, Libya, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia&#13;
and United Arab Emirates) are excluded unless otherwise indicated.&#13;
References to the merchant fleets of developing countries also exclude&#13;
the fleets registered in so-called "open registry" countries (Cyprus,&#13;
Liberia, Oman, Panama, Singapore and Somalia) although not all of the&#13;
tonnage registered in these countries is beneficially owned outside&#13;
them. It is understood that Somalia has changed or is in the process of&#13;
changing its legislation; it might no longer be classified as an open&#13;
registry. Bermuda, the Bahamas and Hong Kong, which are generally&#13;
referred to as tax havens but sometimes also as open registry, are&#13;
included as developing countries.&#13;
2/   The terms international shipping, ocean-going shipping, ocean shipping&#13;
and shipping are used interchangeably to refer to shipping serving foreign&#13;
trade.&#13;

B.   Past World Bank Lending and Other Activities&#13;
1.03      World Bank lending for international shipping has been relatively&#13;
modest. Through June 30, 1979 a total of about US$552 million had been lent&#13;
for all types of shipping, both domestic and international, of which about&#13;
US$521 million was for ships and US$31 million for related activities. This&#13;
includes direct and indirect lending through DFC as summarized below and&#13;
indicated in more detail in Annex I.&#13;

Total as % of World Bank Lending:                     0.8%&#13;
Total as % of World Bank Transportation Lending:      3.8%&#13;
1.04      About 80% of the lending has occurred since 1970.   Of the total&#13;
lending for shipping, approximately 60% was for international shipping and&#13;
40% for domestic shipping, i.e., inland waterways transport, coastal and/or&#13;
inter-island shipping. Direct lending for international shipping or broader&#13;
projects with an international shipping component includes the post-war loans&#13;
to the Netherlands and Norway in the late 1940s/early 1950s and later loans&#13;
to India and Turkey 1/. Indirect World Bank loans for international shipping&#13;
have been made to India, Indonesia, Korea, Morocco, the Philippines, Tanzania&#13;
and Thailand. Annex IB provides a summary of World Bank lending for ocean&#13;
going shipping during the fiscal years (1975-1979) totalling US$115 million&#13;
for one direct loan and 35 indirect loans involving 51 vessels of some&#13;
438,000 dwt. Most of the vessels were bulk carriers (43) and were acquired&#13;
second-hand (36) rather than as new buildings (15).&#13;
1/   The vessels financed under the Indonesia fertilizer distribution project&#13;
($42 million), although primarily intended for inter-island transport,&#13;
have also been used for exports to neighboring countries.&#13;

1.05      This paper does not try to analyze why past World Bank lending has&#13;
been modest. It may be due importantly to the availability of bilateral and&#13;
commercial sources of finance and the relatively low priority given to the&#13;
sector by many countries. The number of requests from member countries for&#13;
World Bank lending for international shipping which have been formally turned&#13;
down or actively discouraged appears to have been very small. However,&#13;
information is not available to indicate the extent to which possible projects&#13;
have been raised informally with World Bank missions and how many such&#13;
inquiries have been discouraged.&#13;
1.06      In addition to lending for the purchase of new or second-hand&#13;
vessels, or for the rehabilitation of existing vessels, the World Bank has&#13;
provided advice and technical assistance, particularly in connection with&#13;
direct loans. Technical assistance has also been provided for improved main-&#13;
tenance and repairs. Funds have been made available for shipping sector plan-&#13;
ning, for the training of ship safety inspectors, and for carrying out major&#13;
improvements in shipyards and maritime training establishments. Consultant&#13;
services have been financed to assist in preparation of taxation surveys and&#13;
to draw up financing and operational plans in private and state shipping&#13;
companies. Individual financial and technical advisors have been provided to&#13;
assist in the establishment of ship finance units in borrowers' banks and&#13;
ship finance institutions. In all of these activities, the World Bank has&#13;
worked in close consultation with the governments and sometimes with bilateral&#13;
lenders and other international organizations. Thus, an important part of&#13;
the World Bank-s involvement in shipping has been assistance in improving the&#13;
institutional framework for the industry.&#13;
1.07      In Indonesia and the Philippines, World Bank inter-island shipping&#13;
projects have resulted in the establishment within large state banks of&#13;
maritime credit units to serve as channels for funds on-lent to private&#13;
shipping companies. Support has also been given to a new organization (PANN)&#13;
established in Indonesia to procure and lease ships. Through the services of&#13;
internationally recruited experts, these newly created units have become&#13;
knowledgeable about the maritime sector of their countries and developed&#13;
expertise in appraising shipping projects. The maritime credit department of&#13;
one bank has financed from its own funds about seven times the amount it has&#13;
financed with funds borrowed from the World Bank. In India, the World Bank's&#13;
involvement has resulted in the establishment of a Marine Department within&#13;
the India Oil Corporation to assist in tanker scheduling and improvements in&#13;
oil handling in Indian ports.&#13;
1.08      World Bank staff have helped to develop shipping projects through&#13;
close consultation with government officials.   Terms of reference for studies&#13;
have been drafted, shipbuilding contracts have been drawn up for use by&#13;
borrowers, procedures for international competitive bidding have been worked&#13;
out, and methods for procuring second-hand ships have been implemented.&#13;
Advice has also been given about ship mortgage procedures, lease and charter&#13;
contracts, ship registration, and safety inspection procedures. In addition,&#13;
information and opinions have been given to borrowers about ship designs,&#13;
shipyard and repair organizations, and ship operating procedures.&#13;

C.   Changing Shipping Scene&#13;
(i) Introduction&#13;
1.09      The demand for ocean shipping is an integral and dependent part of&#13;
international trade, abouit 90% of which (in ton miles) is carried by sea. The&#13;
balance consists of relatively short distance overland transport, mainly&#13;
between continental European or North American countries, and long haul air&#13;
transport of relatively high value/low volume goods.&#13;
1.10      The period since World War II and, particularly the years 1965-1978,&#13;
has been one of major changes in the volume and nature of foreign trade and&#13;
ocean-going shipping industry serving this trade 1/. The following paragraphs&#13;
deal briefly with some of the main changes in seaborne trade and shipping.&#13;
Annexes 2, 3 and 4 provide rhore background information on (i) seaborne trade,&#13;
(ii) types of shipping service and competition, and (iii) shipping conferences.&#13;
(ii) Seaborne Trade and Shipping Tonnage&#13;
1.11      As a result of the growth of the world economy, the demand for&#13;
shipping, both in terms of tons carried and in terms of ton-miles, has&#13;
increased every year since World War II except for 1975. Between 1965 and&#13;
1977 the volume of seaborne trade increased by an average of about 6.5% per&#13;
annum or from about 1,633 to about 3,475 million tons, It reached an esti-&#13;
mated 3,657 million tons in 1979. Between 1965 and 1973 the rate of growth&#13;
averaged 9.1% p.a. but, as a result of inLernational events and world-wide&#13;
recession, the volume increase averaged only 2.7% p.a. between 1973 and 1979.&#13;
Seaborne trade in terms of ton-miles increased faster than in volume - about&#13;
9.7% p.a. between 1965 and 1977 because the average length of haul increased&#13;
from about 3,600 to about 5,200 nautical miles. As a result of changes in&#13;
the crude oil trade between 1977 and 1979, the increase in tonnage was&#13;
largely offset by a reduction in the average haul to 4,800 miles.&#13;
1.12      The increase in seaborne trade in terms of ton-miles was due largely&#13;
to the rapid increase in the volume and average distance of crude oil ship-&#13;
ments. In 1977 crude oil, with an average haul of 7,300 miles, accounted for&#13;
about 60% of seaborne trade. Trade in the five major bulk commodities (iron&#13;
ore, grain, coal, bauxite, and phosphate) accounted for a further 18%, refined&#13;
petroleum products for 6%, a number of so-called "minor-bulk commodities"&#13;
(e.g., manganese ore, sugar, scrap, etc.) shipped by bulk carriers for another&#13;
6%, with the remaining 10% consisting of a large number of heterogenous and&#13;
often high unit value goods commonly referred to as "general cargo". (Table 1).&#13;
Apart from the growth in crude oil transport, an important development in&#13;
1/   Sir Lindsay Alexander has described the period 1965-1978 as one of&#13;
"technical revolution" insofar as shipping is concerned in "The Challenges&#13;
to British Shipping 1965-1990," the 13th Blackadder Lecture 1979, pub-&#13;
lished by North East Coast Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders,&#13;
Newcastle upon Tyne.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
seaborne trade has been the rapid growth in minor bulk commodities shipped by&#13;
bulk carriers. By contrast there has been a relatively modest growth (2.1%&#13;
p.a.) in general cargo, in part, due to the gradual shift of several of the&#13;
minor bulk commodities from liner to bulk shipping, a distinction which will&#13;
be made in the following section.&#13;
1,.13     Excluding capital surplus oil exporting countries, developing&#13;
countries accounted for about 30% of the world seaborne trade tonnages&#13;
in 1974, with their share being higher for tonnages loaded (41%) than for the&#13;
tonnages discharged (18% - Table 2). This reflects the importance of the LDCs&#13;
in the export of petroleum and dry bulk commodities such as iron ore, phosphate,&#13;
bauxite, etc. Although comprehensive up-to-date information is not available,&#13;
the average distance over which the seaborne trade originating in, or destined&#13;
for, the LDCs as a group moves, seems to be considerably longer than for the&#13;
world seaborne trade as a whole.&#13;
1.14      Detailed information is not available on the volume of seaborne&#13;
trade between developing countries. UN statistics suggest that the value of&#13;
all international trade by al:L modes between developing countries (with the&#13;
term "developing countries" here including the capital-surplus, oil-exporting&#13;
countries) amounted, in 1979, to US$99.2 billion, or roughly 6.1% of total&#13;
international trade. This compares with US$10.8 billion and 3.5% in 1970&#13;
(Table 35). The increase has been rapid both in absolute and relative terms.&#13;
Due to the higher share of air and surface transport in the trade between&#13;
developed countries, and the relatively lower unit value of trade between&#13;
developing countries, it is likely that seaborne trade between developing&#13;
countries accounts for a significantly higher percentage than their share&#13;
in the value of total trade. The question of trade between developing coun-&#13;
tries and the importance of shipping to serve this trade is discussed further&#13;
in Chapter III (D) below.&#13;
1.15      The expansion in seaborne trade during the period 1965-1978,&#13;
particularly in bulk commodities, has been accompanied and facilitated by a&#13;
rapid increase in the world shipping tonnage as well as by important techno-&#13;
logical and structural developments in shipping, including large increases&#13;
in the size of bulk vessels and a proliferation of special vessel types&#13;
(Table 3). In terms of gross register ton (grt), world shipping increased&#13;
from 160 million in 1965 to 406 million in 1978, with the share of the LDCs&#13;
increasing from about 7.0% in 1965 to about 8.5% in 1978. In terms of dead-&#13;
weight tonnage (dwt), the fleets registered in developed market economies&#13;
accounted in mid-1978 for 53.3% 1/ of the world tonnage, the open registry&#13;
countries for 30.9%, the LDCs for 8.1%, the centrally planned economies (CPEs)&#13;
for 6.5% and the capital surplus oil exporting countries for 1.2%, according&#13;
to Lloyd's Register of Shipping Statistical Tables. In 1978, the LDCs&#13;
1/   If Greece, Portugal, Spain and Turkey are considered as developing&#13;
countries, in line with the World Development Report 1979 the share of&#13;
the developed countries falls to 42.2% and that of the LDCs increases&#13;
to 19.2%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
accounted for 5.4% of the tanker tonnage, 8.0% of the bulk carrier tonnage&#13;
and 14.6% of other vessels (mainly liners) in terms of dwt, indicating the&#13;
relative priority given initially by most LDCs to liner shipping. Korea is&#13;
one of the few LDCs where development of a national fleet focused initially&#13;
on bulk vessels. In recent years, several LDCs have given increased attention&#13;
to bulk shipping (see also 1.37 and 2.03).&#13;
(iii)   Shipping Technology and Institutional Environment&#13;
a. Shipping Services&#13;
1.16      Before discussing major changes which have occurred, or are taking&#13;
place, in shipping technology and the institutional environment, it is neces-&#13;
sary to identify the main types of shipping services. There are three broad&#13;
categories--scheduled or liner services, tramp or charter services, and indus-&#13;
trial or private 'own account' carriage. These categories generally differ&#13;
in the kind of services offered to the users (shippers), the general types of&#13;
goods carried, and to some extent, the kinds of vessels used, although there&#13;
exists a considerable overlap between the categories. Liner services provide&#13;
regular scheduled services on particular trade routes for break-bulk or&#13;
unitized cargo of less-than-full shiploads. Liner vessels normally carry a&#13;
multitude of cargoes for a large number of different shippers at fixed rates.&#13;
Tramps and industrial, or private, carriers normally involve full shiploads of&#13;
one commodity for one shipper, particularly liquid and dry bulk commodities&#13;
(POL, minerals, grains, etc.).&#13;
1.17      A major difference between liner shipping and tramp shipping is&#13;
that while liner trades are generally categorized as cartelized markets with&#13;
administered prices, tramp shipping is considered as a textbook example of a&#13;
highly competitive market. This is, however, an oversimplification. Thus&#13;
while in almost all significant liner trades the majority of the lines&#13;
serving the trade join together in price fixing cartels called conferences,&#13;
the conference members, apart from internal service competition, face some&#13;
outside competition in many trades from non-conference lines, tramp oper-&#13;
ators, and alternative modes of transport. This competition probably has&#13;
increased significantly in the last few years due, in part, to increased non-&#13;
conference operations by certain NIE shipping lines, the establishment or&#13;
expansion of other non-conference lines, the withdrawal of some members from&#13;
certain conferences 1/ and the inci?ased use of land bridges. Similarly,&#13;
some constraints exist in parts of the tramp markets due to the existence of&#13;
a few very large users (e.g., major petroleum companies) on the demand side&#13;
and to a trend towards establishment of pools and consortia on the supply&#13;
side.&#13;
1/   Sea-Land, the largest container line, for instance, announced in&#13;
January 1980 that it would withdraw from a number of conferences serving&#13;
the United States-Far East trades. This was followed by a series of&#13;
freight rate reductions by the conferences.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
1.18      The different market situation is also reflected in the behavior&#13;
of freight rates over time. In the case of liners, particularly conferences,&#13;
the freight rates show a continuously upward trend in recent years, although&#13;
at markedly different annual increases (Table 4) and with significant differ-&#13;
ences between trades (comparable data are, however, not available on this&#13;
point). On the other hand, tramp rates reported on the open market show very&#13;
marked fluctuations depending on supply and demand conditions (Table 5 and&#13;
Chart 1). However, as indicated in Annex 3 (para. 5), only a small proportion&#13;
of long-term charter business is reported.&#13;
1.19      The riskiness of shipping will be discussed in Chapter III, but it&#13;
should be pointed out at this stage that open market charter rates fluctuate.&#13;
sharply over time. Peak rates tend to be relatively short lived and asso-&#13;
ciated with special demand situations such as the Korean War, the closure of&#13;
the Suez Canal and the 1973 boom. The peak market in 1973/74 was followed by&#13;
a period of excess shipping capacity and an even greater excess shipbuilding&#13;
capacity with depressed and partly subsidized prices for new ships as well as&#13;
depressed second-hand prices. However, since mid-1978 second-hand prices for&#13;
ships as well as charter rates have increased significantly as the surplus&#13;
shipping capacity has been reduced. The ordering of new ships has also&#13;
increased as have new building prices (Tables 6 and 7).&#13;
b. Technological Changes&#13;
1.20      Major technological changes have taken place during the period&#13;
1965-1978. These changes have been particularly significant in the case of&#13;
liner shipping, where there has been a gradual development of the conventional&#13;
liner vessel, including the use of pallets, anA a revolutionary development&#13;
of new vessel types, particularly container vessels, ro/ro vessels as well as&#13;
barge-carrying vessels and combination vessels. Although a few container&#13;
vessels and small ro/ro ferries existed before 1965, they have since grown&#13;
rapidly in size and importance. The productivity of a modern container ship&#13;
in terms of ton-miles per annum is between five and eight times that of a&#13;
conventional cargo liner, and the productivity of a crew member on a large&#13;
container vessel in terms of ton-miles per seaman is perhaps ten times that&#13;
of a person on a conventional liner in 1965 1/. These changes have reduced&#13;
the relative cost of labor to total cost and greatly increased the capital&#13;
costs per vessel and per seafarer. Full container vessels, and to a lesser&#13;
extent ro/ro vessels, have primarily been introduced on the main trade routes&#13;
between developed market economy countries where labor and hence conventional&#13;
cargo handling costs are high. More recently, however, they have also been&#13;
introduced on some trade routes between developed market economy countries&#13;
and LDCs, e.g., between the United States or Europe and the Middle East or&#13;
the Caribbean. In 1979, the tonnage of general cargo vessel sailings from&#13;
developing countriea was about 30% of the tonnage of general cargo vessel&#13;
sailings from developed market economy countries; for full container vessels&#13;
it was 3% and for ro/ro vessels, 14%. The Arabian Gulf accounted for about&#13;
54% of the LDC container sailings and 73% of the ro/ro sailings 2/. Multi-&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
purpose vessels with some container capacity are also being introduced in an&#13;
increasing number of trades.&#13;
1.21      Along with the rapid expansion of seaborne trade in dry and liquid&#13;
bulk commodities, bulk shipping underwent considerable technological changes&#13;
during the period 1965-1978. Thus 1965 saw the first great leap in the size&#13;
of tankers with the appearance of very large crude carriers (VLCC). Although&#13;
started earlier, the rapid increase in tanker size was clearly due in large&#13;
measure to the closure of the Suez Canal in 1967. Also significant was the&#13;
growing importance of the economies of scale for larger vessel sizes in the&#13;
light of the longer average haul via the Cape and the rapidly increasing&#13;
demand for crude. As can be seen from Table 3, the average size of tankers&#13;
increased from 13,000 grt in 1965 to 23,000 grt in 1978. An even clearer&#13;
picture of these changes can be seen from the ag.e/size composition of the&#13;
mid-1978 tanker fleet--average size of the 0-4 year old tankers was 48,500&#13;
grt as compared with 12,200 grt for the 10 years and older tankers. In terms&#13;
of carrying capacity or productivity per ton mile per seafarer, the increase&#13;
has been even faster than reflected by the grt figures. Marked changes have&#13;
also taken place in tanker technology, including increased automation. These&#13;
changes, while reducing real transport costs per unit of cargo have increased&#13;
the investment cost per job. The increase in tanker sizes has given rise to&#13;
increased concern and international regulation concerning tanker safety and&#13;
pollution, particularly within the framework of IMCO.&#13;
1.22      The technological developments, although important, have been less&#13;
marked in dry bulk vessels than in tankers or liners except perhaps for the&#13;
rapid development since 1965 of combined carriers (vessels for alternative&#13;
transportation of liquid and dry bulk cargo and comprising all types of&#13;
ore/oil and bulk/oil carriers). Thus while tankers of 100,000 grt and above&#13;
accounted for 50% of the total tanker tonnage in 1978, only 4% of the bulk&#13;
carrier tonnage were vessels of 100,000 grt or above and all of these were&#13;
combined carriers. Basically, the size limit of modern bulk carriers reflects&#13;
the constraints posed by the Panama Canal. Apart from the tankers and conven-&#13;
tional bulk carriers, several new vessel types have developed or grown in&#13;
Lmportance since 1965 to meet changes in seaborne trade, including LNG and&#13;
LPG vessels, vehicle carriers, forest product carriers, wine tankers, etc.&#13;
There has also recently been a development of combination vessels which can&#13;
carry both bulk and liner cargoes. An important aspect of bulk shipping has&#13;
been the development of so-called neo-builk where certain important commodities&#13;
which were earlier carried as liner cargoes have increasingly been switched&#13;
to full or part-load shipments.&#13;
1.23      In dry bulk and other vessels there have also been improvements in&#13;
instruments, communications equipment and a gradual movement towards automa-&#13;
tion. These have made possible substantial reductions in typical crew sizes&#13;
for the new vessels. In several European countries and in Japan trial&#13;
operations with sharply reduced crews are undeiway.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
1.24      An important factor in shipping costs has been the very rapid&#13;
increase in bunker prices. Fuel oil prices at New York, for instance, rose&#13;
from $2.00 per barrel in mid-1970 to about $21.00 in October 1979, while&#13;
the prices of marine diesel oil (the most important fuel) rose from $3.66 to&#13;
$34.00 per barrel during the same period. Bunker costs have therefore become&#13;
an increasingly important part of shipping costs, accounting for up to 60%&#13;
of the operating costs. According to one estimate, bunker costs in late&#13;
1979 accounted for about 43% of the operating costs of a Norwegian 80,000 dwt&#13;
tanker as compared with 13% five years earlier 1/.&#13;
1.25      Rising bunker costs have induced shipping companies to introduce&#13;
a reduction in the "normal" vessel speeds, have increased research into more&#13;
fuel-efficient engines, and have increased consideration of alternative or&#13;
supplementary forms of power, including coal-powered engines and, even, sails.&#13;
Thus, in recent years, an increasing amount of research has been done on&#13;
wind-assisted vessels or wind-driven (sailing) vessels with auxiliary engines,&#13;
in Belgium, Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, Sweden, the U.K.&#13;
and the U.S. Such vessels would incorporate the latest aerodynamic, elec-&#13;
tronic and automation techniques and their navigation would be assisted with&#13;
up-to-date oceanic knowledge and satellite-observed and relayed meteorological&#13;
data.&#13;
1.26      Shipping is estimated to consume about 5% of the world's oil supply.&#13;
Any modest saving of part of this enormous absolute total would therefore&#13;
appear highly desirable in a fuel-conscious world. Sailing ships would&#13;
not only save fuel but are, at the same time, practically pollution-free.&#13;
They are likely to require more manpower per vessel dwt which would be an&#13;
added advantage for many LDCs. In short, wind-assisted or sailing ships may&#13;
have an increasing claim to being considered as "appropriate technology" for&#13;
part of the shipping industry, e.g., for small and medium-sized bulk carriers&#13;
for the transport of low-value bulk commodities. The introduction of prrto-&#13;
types should be monitored by the Bank.&#13;
c. Institutional Changes&#13;
1.27      The technological developments in liner shipping have also been&#13;
accompanied by significant institutional changes. One of these has been the&#13;
development of consortia, whereby two or more liner companies on a trade route&#13;
join together for the operation of container vessels as one way of spreading&#13;
the heavy investment costs in such vessels, assuring their efficient operation&#13;
and reducing the possibility of overtonnaging. A second institutional&#13;
development has been the growing emphasis by users that shipping conferences&#13;
should consult or even negotiate with shippers' organizations regarding&#13;
freight rate increases and other service matters. At the inter-governmental&#13;
level this point has been reflected in several resolutions adopted by the&#13;
UNCTAD Committee on Shipping since its establishment in 1965. It is a subject&#13;
which has also been given attention in the work of other United Nations&#13;
1/   Journal de la Marine Marchande, January 24, 1980, p. 194.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
bodies, particularly ESCAP. The question of conference/shipper-organization&#13;
consultations is also an important feature of the Convention on a Code of&#13;
Conduct for Liner Conferences.&#13;
1.28      A third major institutional development was the adoption in 1974 by&#13;
a United Nations Conference of Plenipotentiaries of the Convention on a Code&#13;
of Conduct for Liner Conferences. By January 14, 1980, 44 countries, account-&#13;
ing for 17.3% of the relevant world tonnage, had agreed to be bound by the&#13;
Convention, thereby meeting the required number of states (24) but not yet&#13;
the tonnage requirement (25%) for its entry into force 1/. However, at the&#13;
mid-1979 UNCTAD V several countries, including the EEC countries, announced&#13;
their intention of ratifying the Convention and its entry into force therefore&#13;
now appears likely 2/.&#13;
1.29      The Convention was intended partly to provide a certain measure of&#13;
control over shipping conferences, partly to overcome the potential negative&#13;
effects of varying or even conflicting national regulations and cargo prefer-&#13;
ences, and partly to assist those LDCs wishing to do so to build up national&#13;
liner fleets by providing a secure cargo base. Probably one of the most con-&#13;
troversial features of the Convention is the provision for cargo reservation&#13;
or sharing that is referred to, for short, as the 40-40-20 principle 3/.&#13;
The Convention not only guarantees any national shipping line the right, sub-&#13;
ject to certain criteria, to participate in any conference which serves its&#13;
country, it also stipulates that where a conference pooling arrangement&#13;
exists, the national lines of the two countries served should, unless other-&#13;
wise agreed, have an equal share in the trade with about 20% being left for&#13;
third country lines. Annex 5 contains the complete text of these provisions&#13;
as well as Conference Resolution 2 which confirms the freedom of shippers to&#13;
use non-conference vessels and the right of such companies to continue&#13;
operations provided they adhere to the principles of fair competition on a&#13;
commercial basis.&#13;

for 75 percent of the world tonnage have expressed their willingness to&#13;
ratify the Convention (TAD/INF/1084).&#13;
3/   In agreeing in principle to ratify the Convention, the EEC countries&#13;
agreed that Article 2 of the Convention should not be applied in&#13;
conference trades between EEC member states or, on reciprocal basis,&#13;
their trade with other OECD countries. (EEC Council Regulation&#13;
No. 954/79).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
1.30      Although no drastic or sudden changes in liner shipping are likely&#13;
to result from the entry into force of the Convention, it is expected to&#13;
strengthen the conference system and reduce competition in liner shipping;&#13;
and could therefore reduce the need for efficiency and put upward pressure&#13;
on freight rates. It could, however, at the same time, reduce over-supply on&#13;
particular trades. However, the Convention contains compensating provisions&#13;
for consultations between conferences and shippers' organizations on matters&#13;
of common interest, including tariff conditions and tariff changes (Chapter&#13;
III, Article 11). The Convention is likely to result eventually in an increas-&#13;
ing share of liner cargoes being carried by national flag vessels at the&#13;
expense of third flag carriers. It could also mean that some of the more&#13;
successful LDC shipping lines or industries will have to reduce their present&#13;
share of some trades or that future expansion within their foreign trades, or&#13;
in cross-trading, will be restricted. Indian liner vessels, for instance,&#13;
carry more than 40% on some routes; particularly those with LDCs and the&#13;
important India-U.K. run. It could also limit the involvement of CPE lines&#13;
on certain trades; this could be one reason why some European lines favor the&#13;
Convention. A related question is how the cargo-sharing provisions will be&#13;
implemented on a national, regional or sub-regional basis. In the Ivory&#13;
Coast, for example, a rigidly-enforced national cargo-sharing system is&#13;
resulting in significai.t administrative work and delays which could negatively&#13;
affect trade. Where trade volumes are relatively small and present liner&#13;
services are organized on a regional basis, it could also result in inefficient&#13;
use of shipping capacity unless some form of regional or sub-regional coopera-&#13;
tion takes place. An Annex to Resolution 1 of the Conference specifically&#13;
provides that "national lines within a region at one end are to have the&#13;
flexibility of adjustments among themselves in regard to their shares." It&#13;
may be added that a Resolution 106 (V) of UNCTAD V included a clause urging&#13;
"developing countries which are situated within the same liner service area to&#13;
pool information on cargo movements and service requirements with a view&#13;
towards developing joint sailing arrangements to increase the competitiveness&#13;
of their liner fleets." The effect of the Convention on the efficiency of&#13;
liner shipping and liner freight rates will depend mainly on how the Conven-&#13;
tion is implemented. It should not be a substitute for careful economic and&#13;
financial analysis in investment planning.&#13;
1.31      A fourth institutional development in liner shipping has been the&#13;
growing involvement of government-owned or controlled shipping companies,&#13;
both from CPEs and from some LDCs. Several countries are considering or&#13;
have already adopted legislation which would enable them to control competition&#13;
in their trades, particularly from liners belonging to CPEs.&#13;
1.32      On the institutional side of bulk shipping, a significant develop-&#13;
ment has been the increasing number of consortia wherein owners agree to pool&#13;
their tonnage and operate it as one entity, thus benefiting from economies&#13;
of scale and increased flexibility. This has both facilitated, and been&#13;
encouraged by, the rapid expansion of so-called contracts of affreightment,&#13;
i.e., a contract for the provision of an agreed shipping capacity for a speci-&#13;
fied time between nominated ports at agreed rates but without specification&#13;
of the particular vessel/vessels to be used.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
1.33      A second important institutional development in bulk shipping has&#13;
been the rapid increase in bulk shipping under so-called open registry.&#13;
In mid-1978 approximately 36% of the world tanker fleet in terms of dwt was&#13;
registered in the open registry countries and 30% of the builk carrier tonnage.&#13;
According to an UNCTAD study approximately 75% of the open registry .fleet was&#13;
beneficially owned in four countries--the United States, Hong Kong, Greece and&#13;
Japan 1/. The rapid growth of the open registry fleets in recent years has&#13;
given rise to dnsiderable discussion on the desirability of this trend. This&#13;
question was discussed at UNCTAD V where resolution 120(V) of June 3, 1979,&#13;
inter alia, called on the UNCTAD secretariat to study the repercussions of&#13;
phasing out open registries (Annex 6, paras. 10-12). The UNCTAD secretariat&#13;
and, apparently, most LDCs see the phasing out of open registry shipping both&#13;
as morally right and as a means of bringing shipping under closer government&#13;
control. They also see an opportunity for a substantial increase in LDC-owned&#13;
bulk fleets due to their potential for providing low cost crews. The UNCTAD&#13;
secretariat argues that the gradual phasing out of open registry fleets would&#13;
achieve the above objectives without adversely affecting freight rate levels 2/.&#13;
Although some LDCs would indeed be likely to increase their bulk fleets&#13;
and operate them efficiently, either alone or in joint venture with shipping&#13;
interests--presently involved in open registry operations or bulk shipping in&#13;
developed countries, it is far from clear what would happen with the present&#13;
open registry fleet. It is also far from clear that such a phasing out and&#13;
the potential reduction in competition which might result, particularly if&#13;
the phasing out is combined with cargo sharing arrangements, would not&#13;
negatively affect freight rates 3/.&#13;
1/   Beneficial Ownership of Open Registry Fleets - 1979 (TD/B/C.4/AC.1/7),&#13;
report by the UNCTAD secretariat, October 1979. This included fleets&#13;
registered in Liberia, Panama, Singapore, Cyprus, Bermuda, Hong Kong&#13;
and Bahamas.&#13;
2/   The Repercussions of Phasing Out Open Registries (TD/B/C.4/AC.1/5),&#13;
report by the UNCTAD secretariat, September 1979. The report argues&#13;
that the main impact would be felt by "transnational corporations which&#13;
are operating outside national jurisdictions and keeping their profits&#13;
and cash flows outside the monetary and fiscal controls exercised by&#13;
States."&#13;
3/   Different viewpoints on these and related aspects were presented at the&#13;
January 1980 meeting of the UNCTAD Ad Hoc Intergovernmental Working Group&#13;
on the Economic Consequences of the Existence or lack of a Genuine Link&#13;
between Vessels and Flag of Registry, see Report of the Group (TD/B/784)&#13;
dated February 8, 1980. This meeting failed to reach any agreement. The&#13;
representatives from LDCs (with the exception of several open registry&#13;
countries) and the CPEs generally supported the phasing out of open&#13;
registries. The representatives of developed market economy countries,&#13;
while recognizing some negative aspects of open registry shipping, stated&#13;
that several aspects needed more thorough consideration before decisions&#13;
could be taken. A number of these questions were raised in a recent&#13;
study by the Economist Intelligence Unit Ltd. for the United States&#13;
Council of the International Chamber of Commerce, Open Registry Shipping--&#13;
Some Economic Considerations, London 1979.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
1.34      Concurrently, the International Transport Workers Federation (ITF)&#13;
is continuing its efforts to force shipowners operating under open registry&#13;
to meet ITF demands on wages and conditions. This, apparently, is contrary&#13;
to the views of the unions of developing countries in Asia (para. 3.08),&#13;
which provide a significant portion of the crews of open registry vessels.&#13;
1.35      Although some developed and developing countries have taken legisla-&#13;
tive or administrative measures in the past to require the use of national&#13;
flag vessels for part of their bulk trade, the question of an international&#13;
understanding on cargo sharing and "equitable participation" of national flag&#13;
vessels in a country's foreign trade has recently been raised at a broader&#13;
level by the developing countries and UNCTAD. At UNCTAD V the LDCs put&#13;
through a resolution 1/ setting out certain principles for "equitable&#13;
participation" in bulk shipping and calling for a program of studies by UNCTAD&#13;
to help developing countries create and expand their own shipping services&#13;
(Annex 6). Although it is too early to know what will happen on this point&#13;
and its effect on world shipping and freight costs, it should be borne in mind&#13;
that any rigid and large scale system of cargo sharing must result in increased&#13;
ballast, non-income earning and voyages as well as less efficient use of&#13;
global shipping capacity and hence an -ipward pressure on shipping costs and&#13;
freight rates.&#13;
D.   International Resolutions and Actions by Developing Countries&#13;
1.36      Closely related to the changes in the international shipping scene&#13;
discussed above, and reflecting the increased interest of several LDCs in ship-&#13;
ping, a number of international resolutions have been adopted in recent years&#13;
aimed at facilitating the expansion of the merchant fleets of developing&#13;
countries. Firstly, UNCTAD V adopted a resolution 2/ requesting the&#13;
IFIs to assist developing countries finance the purchasing of new or second-&#13;
hand ships as well as port facilities (Annex 7). The UNCTAD Committee on&#13;
Shipping had previously unanimously urged the World Bank Group and the&#13;
regional development banks to consider increased lending for vessel acquisi-&#13;
tion (Annex 8 contains the relevant texts). Also, in early 1978, the UNCTAD&#13;
Group of Experts on Improved Methods of Financing Ship Acquisition by Develop-&#13;
ing Countries advocated increased multilateral and bilateral lending for&#13;
shipping.  The Group concluded, inter alia, that the lack of finance on&#13;
suitable conditions has been a factor which has restricted the establishment&#13;
and/or growth of the merchant marines of developing countries; that the&#13;
existing multilateral aid bodies are adequately structured to meet the needs&#13;
of developing countries in this respect if these bodies pay more attention to&#13;
shipping development; and that the possibility of using bilateral or multi-&#13;
lateral aid for the acquisition of second-hand vessels should be explored&#13;
thoroughly (Annex 9 contains the summary and conclusions of the Group's&#13;
report). Various resolutions by the United Nations, the Group of 77 (the&#13;
1/   23 developed market economy countries voted against, while most socialist&#13;
countries abstained.&#13;
2/   23 countries, the developed market economy countries, abstained.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
developing countries) and regional groups of LDCs have advocated larger&#13;
merchant marines for the LDCs as a group (Annex 10 contains the relevant&#13;
texts of some illustrative resolutions). Finally, as already mentioned, the&#13;
Convention on a Code of Conduct for Liner Conferences, inter alia, provides a&#13;
basis for developing countries- shipping companies to join conferences serving&#13;
their foreign trade through its membership and cargo sharing provisions&#13;
(Annex 5). I/&#13;
1.37      Secondly, at the national level several LDCs have, in recent years,&#13;
taken steps, or expressd the wish, to expand their merchant marines. In some&#13;
cases this has been done on a bilateral or sub-regional basis (Chapter III (D)).&#13;
This has particularly been the case of general cargo (liner) merchant fleets&#13;
where the LDCs argue that the foreign-controlled conferences have increased&#13;
freight rates arbitrarily and excessively and paid insufficient attention to&#13;
their national interest. Several LDCs with large bulk imports or exports&#13;
have also started to develop national or regional bulk fleets in the expressed&#13;
hope of increasing their economic returns and/or obtaining a greater financial&#13;
retuirn from their natural resources. Several countries may also be attempting&#13;
to increase the returns through increased processing of raw materials. The&#13;
increasing interest of some LDCs should also be seen against the age composi-&#13;
tion of the fleets of LDCs, particularly general cargo vessels, where almost&#13;
half the tonnage of LDCs was 15 years or older in mid-1977 and therefore&#13;
possibly approaching or exceeding the economical life of the vessels.&#13;
Consequently, for the LDCs just to maintain their existing shipping tonnage&#13;
would require substantial investments.&#13;
1/   Other major aspects covered include consultation with shippers, freight&#13;
rate increases and settlement of disputes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

II. SHIPPING OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES&#13;
2.01      Individual LDCs or groups of LDCs have a number of options regarding&#13;
the maritime transport of their foreign trade. Going from one extreme to&#13;
another these include:&#13;
(a) ignoring maritime transport arrangements and costs completely&#13;
by selling on f.o.b. (free on board) terms and buying on c.&#13;
&amp; f. (cost and freight) or c.i.f. (cost, insurance and freight)&#13;
terms only - thus leaving shipping arrangements to the trading&#13;
partner and foregoing any control or influence over freight&#13;
arrangements and costs;&#13;
(b) having independent companies in LDCs arrange the maritime&#13;
transport with foreign-owned shipping lines, so that the terms&#13;
of shipment used give the LDC company some degree of commercial&#13;
control over the shipping arrangements - thus leaving individual&#13;
shippers with control over the shipping arrangements but little&#13;
or no influence over freight rates except, possibly, for very&#13;
large shipments;&#13;
(c) relying on foreign-owned shipping lines but organizing the&#13;
LDC shippers into a shippers' council or trade association 1/&#13;
in order to strengthen the bargaining position of national,&#13;
and possibly even regional, shippers vis-a-vis the shipping&#13;
conferences or shipping lines. Negotiations could then take&#13;
place regarding freight rates and particulars of service,&#13;
and through control over sufficient cargo volumes, facilitate&#13;
the introduction of bulk shipping, all with the aim of obtain-&#13;
ing the lowest possible freight costs. A related and comple-&#13;
mentary option is to encourage a domestic freight forwarding&#13;
industry for international door-to-door freight control over&#13;
general cargo movements between inland points;&#13;
(d) establishing private and/or public shipping line(s) to serve&#13;
part of the foreign trade by using time chartered or leased&#13;
liner and/or bulk ships   or such vessels acquired on a&#13;
hire-purchase basis whereby, at the end of the charter or&#13;
lease period, they become the property of the national ship-&#13;
ping line. This latter approach has been used very exten-&#13;
sively and apparently successfully in the case of Korea. It&#13;
may be mentioned that the Convention or Code of Conduct for&#13;
Liner Conferences recognizes the right of member lines to use&#13;
chartered tonnage to fulfill their conference obligations&#13;
(see Annex 5, article 2, para. 11);&#13;
1/   Several reports dealing with such organizations are indicated in the&#13;
bibliography.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
(e)  establishing private and/or public shipping line(s) to serve&#13;
part of the foreign trade by domestically owned vessels. In the&#13;
liner trades this might involve operating either inside existing&#13;
shipping conferences or operating a non-conference service to&#13;
compete with a conference and help assure that conference rates&#13;
are not monopolistic;&#13;
(f) establishing or expanding of a privately or publicly-owned&#13;
national merchant marine to serve not only the foreign trade&#13;
but also to enter cross-trades on a competitive basis.&#13;
These alternatives, which will be referred to in Chapter III below when discuss-&#13;
ing the potential benefits to LDCs from investments in international shipping,&#13;
can be presented schematically as follows:&#13;
Types of Shipping Options&#13;
No Shipping Capability               Natural Shipping Capability&#13;
a              b               c             d          e          f&#13;
Owned Tonnage&#13;
No control    Using freight     Shippers       Using      For use    For use&#13;
of shipping   brokers or        councils       chartered  in the     in the&#13;
(buy c.i.f.   shipping agents   or similar     or leased  country-s  country's&#13;
and sell      with control      organiza-      tonnage.   foreign    foreign&#13;
f.o.b.)       over shipping     tions with                trade.     trade and&#13;
arrangements,     control over                         also in&#13;
but not rates.    shipping                             cross-&#13;
arrangements                         trading.&#13;
and some&#13;
control or&#13;
influence&#13;
over rates.&#13;
2.02      It should be noted that under options (a), (b) and (c) above, some&#13;
national flag shipping might develop "naturally" without any public policy&#13;
related to the development of national flag shipping. Also there may be a&#13;
difference between registration and ownership as a shipping company of an LDC&#13;
might register its vessels in another country, e.g., an open registry country&#13;
or a developed country. Conversely, an LDC-registered shipping company could&#13;
be a joint venture between national and foreign interests, facilitating&#13;
transfer of technology and of operational experience.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
2.03      Although no up-to-date survey is available, it would appear from&#13;
press reports and available statistics that in recent years there has been a&#13;
gradual movement of developing countries away from options (a) and (b) towards&#13;
(c) and even (d) or (e) above, or a combination of (c), (d) and (e). According&#13;
to Lloyd½s Register of Shipping Statistical Tables, which includes all vessels&#13;
of 100 grt and above, about 41 LDCs had a merchant fleet tonnage in excess of&#13;
100,000 dwt in 1978 as compared with 24 in 1970 (Table 8). These 41 countries&#13;
accounted for 98% of the merchant fleet tonnage of all LDCs in 1978; the four&#13;
leading countries (India, Brazil, Korea and Yugoslavia) alone accounted for&#13;
43% of the LDC tonnage. According to an UNCTAD survey, in mid-1976 shippers~&#13;
councils or equivalent organizations had been set up in 33 developing countries&#13;
or territories, although 10 were inoperative for various reasons 1/. Neverthe-&#13;
less, it would appear that options (a) and (b) are still commonly used in a&#13;
number of developing countries, particularly in the smaller countries or&#13;
territories of Africa, the Caribbean and Oceania. Options (c), (d), (e) and&#13;
(f) have been adopted more commonly in the industrialized countries but also&#13;
apply to some LDCs as noted above.&#13;
2.04      One of the clearest examples of the change which has taken place in&#13;
some developing countries is India. After independence, India started building&#13;
up its merchant marine in order to carry a substantial part of its foreign&#13;
trade to the point where, in 1977-78, Indian shipping carried about 55% of the&#13;
country's seaborne imports and 24% of seaborne exports, for an overall share&#13;
of 38%. By types of commodities the share was highest for coal (85%) and&#13;
POL (60%) and lowest for exports of ores (21%). It was 38% for general&#13;
cargo. At the same time regional shippers- councils were established and&#13;
supported by a Freight Investigation Bureau.&#13;
2.05      Other developing countries which have partly moved towards options&#13;
(d) and (e) include Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Philippines and&#13;
Korea (Table 9); the latter has also moved towards option (f), as has India to&#13;
a lesser extent. Some of these countries supplement their owned fleets with&#13;
chartered vessels. For instance, in 1977 Brazil carried 12% of its foreign&#13;
trade by owned vessels (27% for general cargo, 8% for dry bulk and 15% for&#13;
liquid bulk) and another 39% by foreign vessels chartered by Brazilian ship-&#13;
owners. A special case is the Maldive Islands, whose merchant fleet of&#13;
119,000 dwt in mid-1978 consisted mainly of relatively small and old second-&#13;
hand, general cargo vessels operated on a tramp basis. Transfer of profits&#13;
from the Maldives Shipping Ltd. during the period 1975-1978 accounted for&#13;
about 22% of government revenues.&#13;
2.06      Industrialized countries relying largely on options (b) or (c) and&#13;
those where national flag vessels carried less than 5% of their ocean-borne&#13;
foreign trade include Australia, the Netherlands, the United States and Canada&#13;
(Table 9), although Australia has now entered its main liner trades with&#13;
Europe and Japan, and the United States has taken some steps to acquire bulk&#13;
carriers for its important bulk dry cargo trades in addition to continuing to&#13;

- 18 -&#13;
subsidize part of its liner shipping. Canada, reportedly, is reconsidering&#13;
its ocean-going shipping policy. It should, however, be pointed out that&#13;
apart from the share carried by national flag vessels, additional cargo may,&#13;
in the case of some countries, be carried by vessels beneficially owqned in&#13;
these countries but registered in open registry countries. Thus, while in&#13;
mid-1978, the merchant fleet of the United States totalled 23.9 million dwt,&#13;
an estimated 62.4 million dwt of additional tonnage were beneficially owned&#13;
in the United States but registered in open registry countries. The&#13;
corresponding figures for Canada were 3.6 million and 2.7 million dwt and for&#13;
the Netherlands 7.9 million and 1.2 million dwt respectively. Industrialized&#13;
countries opprating option (f) include Greece, Norway and the United Kingdom&#13;
as well as, more recently, the USSR with respect to liners.   It may be added&#13;
that in addition to the 57.0 million dwt of national registered tonnage,&#13;
Greece beneficially owned another 40.7 million dwt under open registry flags&#13;
in mid-1978.&#13;

III.   BASIC FACTORS IN SHIPPING INVESTMENT DECISIONS&#13;
A.   Introduction&#13;
3.01      This section discusses several basic factors in shipping invest-&#13;
ment decisions and the potential benefits to certain LDCs from selective&#13;
investments in international shipping. The discussion is, of necessity, in&#13;
general terms. In practice, a large number of variables affect investments in&#13;
shipping which can only be considered in terms of decisions about specific&#13;
vessels on specific trades under specific conditions at a given time. Some&#13;
shipping companies and individuals have developed computer programs to facili-&#13;
tate the investment analysis. The discussion is based on a review of avail-&#13;
able information, supplemented by visits to India and Korea. The available&#13;
data show very wide variations depending on factors which cannot readily be&#13;
isolated. Sub-section B considers briefly certain general aspects related to&#13;
investments in shipping while sub-section C discusses the possible benefits&#13;
from such investments. Sub-section D discusses the question of trade and&#13;
shipping among developing countries. Finally, sub-section E relates the&#13;
various points discussed in sections B-D.&#13;
B.   General Considerations&#13;
(i) Introduction&#13;
3.02      Major investments in shipping require careful analysis of the usual&#13;
economic, financial, technical and institutional aspects as well as considera-&#13;
tion of inter-sectoral priorities and transport sector considerations. While&#13;
this analytical approach will apply to any investment decision, the special&#13;
nature of shipping in general and the particular type of shipping or trade&#13;
decision in question make such analysis of the utmost importance since shipping&#13;
can be a risky, relatively low profit and capital intensive industry. Before&#13;
discussing briefly the first two of these characteristics of the shipping&#13;
industry (the third will be considered in section (C) under employment), it&#13;
is useful to stress three points. Firstly, shipping is not a uniform industry&#13;
selling a homogeneous product; it is a composite of different types of&#13;
shipping services and vessels operating on a multitude of trade routes each&#13;
with differing conditions. Secondly, although ocean shipping services are,&#13;
and probably will continue to be, the dominating mode of transport in inter-&#13;
national trade, there are a number of alternative ways in which shipping&#13;
requirements can be met (see Chapter II above). Thirdly, ships are mobile&#13;
assets which can be bought, sold, and chartered on the international market.&#13;
The trend towards more capital intensive and specialized vessels has, however,&#13;
increased the scope for errors of judgment in assessing the shipping market.&#13;
It has also increased the importance of careful consideration as to the&#13;
timing of vessel acquisition and of procurement procedures. The variations&#13;
in charter rates and vessel prices, particularly for secondhand vessels, are&#13;
directly related as high rates tend to be accompanied by relatively high&#13;
vessel prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
3.03      Key aspects which, from a national point of view, should be covered&#13;
in the shipping investment analysis include:&#13;
(i) the existing volume, composition and pattern of trade; its&#13;
organization and the likelihood of changes in trade oxrgaul-&#13;
zations, volume and patterns;&#13;
(ii) the existing shipping services used in the different trades,&#13;
including the suitability of these services/vessels and&#13;
their costs and the freight rates/charges;&#13;
(iii) the extent to which part or all of the trade needs could be&#13;
better met, or provided at a lower cost, by alternative&#13;
arrangements and the extent to which these would require&#13;
organizational changes or investments i.n related facilities&#13;
such as ports, etc.;&#13;
(iv) the institutional, operational and supporting facilities and&#13;
staff required and available for national flag shipping and&#13;
how any possible gaps could be filled -- this should include&#13;
questions concerning crew training facilities, management,&#13;
ship registration provisions, transfer of flag provisions,&#13;
ship mortgage and lien provisions, currency transfer regula-&#13;
tions and other special aspects arising from the inter-&#13;
national character of shipping;&#13;
(v) the role of the government in regulation and promotion of&#13;
shipping, including dependence on measures to "steer" or&#13;
direct cargoes;&#13;
(vi) vessel acquisition procedures and the financing possibilities;&#13;
(vii) evaluation of economic benefits of alternative investments in&#13;
ships, taking into account the relative advantages of second-hand&#13;
vessels versus new buildings from national or foreign yards.&#13;
The economic evaluation involves consideration of the ability of the&#13;
vessels to operate profitably at competitive rates and what benefits the&#13;
proposed investments will yield as compared with alternative investments in&#13;
other sectors. As discussed later, these benefits may, apart from profits,&#13;
include foreign exchange savings, positive effects on freight rates and&#13;
trade, employment, development effects through linkages with other sectors&#13;
of the economy, the stimulation of local entrepreneurship, greater security&#13;
of services, etc.&#13;
3.04      From the operating enterprise's or company s point of view, a number&#13;
of detailed organizational, operational, financial and technical aspects will&#13;
need detailed studies before any investment decision could be finalized and&#13;
implemented. The organizational structure of the company will depend,&#13;
inter alia, on the type of shipping services to be provided, the size of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

(ii) Profitability of Shipping&#13;
3.05      Although it is frequently stated that international shipping yields&#13;
a relatively modest return on investment, only limited comparative data is&#13;
available. It should also be emphasized that little, if any, comparative&#13;
data appear to be available concerning the profitability of open registry&#13;
shipping. This is also true for the rapidly increasing, and presumably com-&#13;
petitive, Greek and Hong Kong shipping industries 2/. Due to the great&#13;
variations in conditions in different shipping trades and services as well&#13;
as the differerces which arise from differences in national accounting pro-&#13;
cedures or regulations (e.g., vessel depreciation policies in light of tax&#13;
laws, regulations and commercial practices), meaningful comparisons of the&#13;
level of profitability in shipping in different countries, and even between&#13;
different companies in a given country, pose major practical problems.&#13;
Differences in debt/equity ratios need to be considered in comparing the&#13;
profitability of shipping and other industries. The profitability of public&#13;
sector shipping companies, such as the Shipping Corporation of India, may&#13;
also be affected by public service obligations not only in coastal shipping&#13;
but also in international shipping in some cases.&#13;
3.06      The cyclical fluctuations mentioned in the following section&#13;
further complicate any proper analysis of this point since data Lor one, or&#13;
even a few years, are unlikely to be representative of the total investment&#13;
period. In this connection it should be recalled that the period 1975-1978&#13;
has been a very depressed period in international shipping, particularly bulk&#13;
shipping. This is clearly seen in the case of Korea where, for the ocean-going&#13;
shipping industry, net income before tax as a per cent of equity between 1970&#13;
and 1978 varied between (-9.5%) and 38.6% and the net working surplus as a&#13;
percent of fixed assets varied between 13.5% in 1978 and 28.2% in 1973 with&#13;
working ratios of respectively 80 and 68% (Table 10). The diversification of&#13;
some European and American shipping companies into other sectors and the pro-&#13;
duction of only aggregated financial accounts is a further complicating fac-&#13;
tor in any analysis.&#13;
3.07      Notwithstanding the limitations of using, in part, second-hand data&#13;
without details as to their exact coverage and compilation, Tables 10-18&#13;
present available information relating to the profitability of shipping and&#13;
other industries in several countries. Due to differences such as deprecia-&#13;
tion policies, tax rules and debt/equity ratios, the net working surplus, as a&#13;
percent of net fixed assets, might be the preferred basis for international&#13;

included in the bibliography.&#13;
2/   For 1975 and 1976, years of relatively depressed shipping markets, the&#13;
net profits after taxes of one major Hong Kong shipping company repre-&#13;
sented a net return of 23% on net worth according to data provided by&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
comparisons. The available data was not, however, sufficiently detailed to&#13;
permit a consistent and uniform presentation of all the financial data, hence&#13;
the presentation on different bases.&#13;
3.08      Thu-.-,,----es 11-13 tend to confirm the relatively low profitability&#13;
of shipping in some industrialized countries. Table 11, for instance, indicates&#13;
that for a sample of British shipping companies' net income before tax, as a&#13;
percentage of capital employed, averaged 6.2% during the period 1950-1969 as&#13;
compared with an average of 15.0% for all companies/industries sampled. The&#13;
Belgian, French and German shipping companies listed in Table 11 are basically&#13;
liner companies and the 1976 result should not therefore have been drastically&#13;
distorted by the depressed bulk market of that year; Hapag-Llbyd½s 1976&#13;
return of 5.3% was in fact higher than the average for the 1970-1976 period&#13;
(3.9%).&#13;
3.09      The Indian data in Table 11 and detailed further in Table 14,&#13;
however, indicate the caution with which these data must be used as special&#13;
tax provisions for shipping may change the relationships between before-tax&#13;
earnings and after tax profitability of shipping and general industry. Thus,&#13;
for a sample of Indian industries and companies during 1965/66-1976/77, ship-&#13;
ping had the lowest return in terms of net operating surplus as a percentage&#13;
of net fixed assets and net income before tax as a percentage of equity, but&#13;
showed the highest return in terms of net income after tax as a percentage of&#13;
equity. This result may be due in part to the very high debt/equity ratio&#13;
for shipping, low interest rates from the Government for ship acquisition,&#13;
and special tax advantages given to the industry. A somewhat similar picture&#13;
results from a comparison of the relative profitability of the Shipping&#13;
Corporation of India (SCI) and selected other major Government of India&#13;
enterprises during the period 1969/70-1977/78 (Table 15). This comparison&#13;
showr d that although the weighted average return of SCI in terms of net&#13;
operating surplus as a percentage of net fixed assets was below the average&#13;
for the sample, mainly due to the poor results in 1975/76 - 1977/78, its&#13;
return in terms of net operating surplus as a percentage of capital employed&#13;
and even more so for net income as a percentage of equity, was well above the&#13;
average. The profitability of SCI may have been negatively affected by&#13;
certain service obligations, including certain coastal trades, but it is not&#13;
known how significant this has been.&#13;
3.10      Although the above data must be used with great caution due to the&#13;
valuation differences mentioned in para. 3.05, they indicate not only that&#13;
there were marked differences in the relative profitability of shipping in&#13;
different countries, but also that there were wide variations in overall&#13;
returns on different types of shipping in particular countries (Table 16,&#13;
page 1, Footnotes a and d). The latter point is also reflected in Norwegian&#13;
data which show great differences in the profitability of different Norwegian&#13;
vessels in different types of shipping (Table 17). It should be noted that&#13;
cyclical fluctuations in bulk shipping, particu-larly spot market bulk ship-&#13;
ping, together with the shortage of comparable time series makes it difficult&#13;
to draw conclusions regarding the relative profitability of liner and bulk&#13;
shipping. This is further complicated by the fact that some bulk shipping&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
companies tend to "play the market", while others may tend to charter their&#13;
vessels on a long-term basis. Nevertheless, the data in Table 17 indicate&#13;
that during the period 1970-1974, the return on investment in Norwegian liner&#13;
sh''pping was significantly less than in bulk shipping; separate data for 1947-&#13;
1957 showed a similar Dattern    The Table also shows large differences between&#13;
vessels or companies engaged in the same types of shipping. Even in confer-&#13;
ence-organized liner trades there may be great differences in the relative&#13;
profitability of liners of a particular country on the same trade route. As&#13;
indicated by Deakin and Seward 1/ there are large differences even in the&#13;
profitability of different British liner companies operating on the same trade&#13;
route at similar conference freight rates.&#13;
3.11      Also with regard to LDCs, the available information (including that&#13;
in Tables 10, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 18) shows a mixed picture. Thus, selected&#13;
shipping companies in some LDCs appear to have earned returns comparable to,&#13;
or better than, those of lines in some developed countries. Such returns may&#13;
also be equal to, or better than, the average return of other public sector&#13;
companies in their countries in certain years, e.g., in India and Sri Lanka.&#13;
The rapid expansion of some privately owned LDC shipping companies, e.g. in&#13;
Hong Kong, would tend to indicate that they are reasonably profitable; this is&#13;
as partly confirmed by the data referred to in the footnote to para. 3.05 2/.&#13;
On the other hand, some LDCs lines are understood to have been losing money&#13;
for a number of years and to be dependent on financial assistance from the&#13;
government, while others have made only marginal returns. Thus, according to&#13;
the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), the financial position of most&#13;
African shipping lines is precarious, with most of them existing on national&#13;
subsidies 3/. A study of shipping in the Commonwealth developing countries,&#13;
while noting that information had not been forthcoming to derive conclusive&#13;
evidence on the profitability of shipping lines in these countries, expressed&#13;
the view that the revenues of most lines covered both their direct and&#13;
indirect costs and yielded some profits. However, the authors doubted&#13;
whether the returns on capital invested in shipping matched the oppottunity&#13;
cost of capital in many developing Commonwealth countries 4/.&#13;

- 24 -&#13;
3.12      Maybe the most that can be said on the basis of the available&#13;
information is that, at the feasibility study stage, very careful analysis&#13;
will be required of the likely profitability of new shipping investments,&#13;
taking into account the particular conditions in the trade in quest.ion,&#13;
including the market risks involved and possible ways of minimizing these.&#13;
Sensitivity analysis of key variables such as future market conditions, load&#13;
factors, etc. appears essential and should be based on a realistic assessment&#13;
of potential fluctuations.&#13;
(iii) Riskiness and Market Fluctuations&#13;
3.13      Shipping is generally considered a risky business that is subject&#13;
to considerable fluctuations in demand which results in wide fluctuations in&#13;
profitability. In bulk shipping, these fluctuations in demand are also accom-&#13;
panied by wide fluctuations in freight rates. The riskiness was illustrated&#13;
by conditions in early 1978 when there was a shipping surplus of about 100&#13;
million dwt, mostly tankers, representing about one-sixth of the total world&#13;
tonnage 1/. Many shipping companies lost money as the open market freight&#13;
rates for tankers and some bulk carriers were insufficient to cover even the&#13;
running costs of vessels. Several companies either sold off part of their&#13;
fleet, went out of business or operated with government assistance. Several&#13;
developed market economy countries, as well as some LDCs, took special,&#13;
hopefully temporary, measures to assist their shipping industries as well&#13;
as their shipbuilding industries.&#13;
3.14      However, the above gloomy picture did not apply equally to all&#13;
types of shipping, or in all trades, or to all companies in a given trade.&#13;
Thus, in March/April 1978, 10.8% of the tanker grt tonnage was laid up as&#13;
compared with 4.4% of all other tonnage. Liners accounted for only about 2%&#13;
of the laid up tonnage as compared with 21% of the world tonnage. Reflecting,&#13;
in part, differences in fleet composition and trading patterns, the percentage&#13;
laid up varied markedly from country to country ranging from 25%'. or more for&#13;
Libya, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway to 2% in the case of Japan and none for&#13;
India and Korea 2/.&#13;
3.15      Historically, open market charter rates show very large varia-&#13;
tions depending on demand and supply situations, but this is not the case&#13;
in liner rates (see Tables 4 and 5, also Graph 1). Nor is it to the same&#13;
extent applicable to bulk rates under privately negotiated, long-term&#13;
charter arrangements. The reason for the volatility of the open market&#13;
charter rates is that they represent, in large part, a marginal market&#13;
responding to demand fluctuating with changes in world trade as well as to&#13;
special political or military events such as the closure and reopening of&#13;
the Suez Canal. Volatility is also closely related to the relatively high&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
proportion of fixed costs in shipping. The supply of vessels at a given&#13;
time is relatively fixed by the fact that building new ships takes time, and&#13;
that shipowners, as a group, tend to order excessively during periods of peak&#13;
demand. The tonnage contracted in 1973, a year of peak demand and high&#13;
freight rates, was more than twice the tonnage ordered in each of the two&#13;
preceding years, and also almost twice the combined tonnage ordered in the&#13;
four depressed years 1975-1978 1/. Although it is extremely difficult to&#13;
know when the shipping market will be in equilibrium, it is worth noting that&#13;
charter rates, as well as second-hand values in many instances, more than&#13;
doubled by June 1979 from the extremely depressed conditions in June 1978.&#13;
-The laid up tonnage fell from about 57 million dwt in mid-1978 to 24 million&#13;
dwt in May 1979 and 10 million dwt at the end of 1979 when about 1.6% of the&#13;
world tonnage was laid up (see also Table 19). The tonnage of new ships on&#13;
order, which had been declining sharply from about 268 million dwt in January&#13;
1974 to 51 million in April 1979 also increased modestly during the second&#13;
and third quarter of 1979 to 57 million dwt 2/.&#13;
3.16      The variations in open market rates cause wide fluctuations in&#13;
the profitability of bulk shipping over time although their severity can&#13;
be moderated through the use of long-term contracts and the utilization of&#13;
escalation clauses. In the case of the liner trades, although not normally&#13;
subject to short run fluctuations in freight rates 3/, profitability is&#13;
affected by variations in demand and the degree of non-conference competition,&#13;
changes in the efficiency of shipboard operations, and higher costs for fuel&#13;
(unless fully offset by bunker surcharges) and insurance, etc. It should,&#13;
however, be noted that from the point of view of a country's foreign trade,&#13;
reliance on foreign-owned shipping may also involve some economic and polit-&#13;
ical risks with regard to the availability of sufficient tonnage and, more&#13;
importantly, with regard to freight costs, not covered by long-term charters.&#13;
The market risks would be greatly reduced in the case of vessels committed on&#13;
a long-term basis to carrying part of a country's foreign trade.&#13;
C.   Potential Benefits to LDCs from Selective Shipping Investments&#13;
(i) Introduction and Methodology&#13;
3.17      International shipping to serve a country's normal foreign trade&#13;
can be looked upon as an import substitution investment. A second type of&#13;
international shipping, cross-trading or option (f) of para. 2.01, would be&#13;
more akin to an export industry. The latter will not be discussed here&#13;
since, at present, few developing countries appear to consider shipping&#13;

- 26 -&#13;
investments solely for this purpose, although it is of considerable importance&#13;
in the case of the Maldives, Hong Kong, Korea, and India. It is also possible&#13;
that in several case due to the trade patterns, some cross-trading might be&#13;
necessary in individual cases to enable full and efficient use of vessels&#13;
basically intended to serve the direct foreign trade of a country.&#13;
3.18      As in the case of any import substitution, investment in shipping&#13;
for a country's foreign trade can initially be looked upon as the avoided&#13;
import cost or freight payment, and the cost of imported goods and services&#13;
and national resources used to provide the shipping service, taking into&#13;
account shadow prices where appropriate 1./&#13;
3.19      Developing countries investing in shipping generally claim that&#13;
such investments are needed in order to save foreign exchange, to reduce&#13;
freight costs and thus promote a country's foreign trade, to provide added&#13;
employment, and to assure adequate and reliable shipping services. These&#13;
potential benefits are discussed in the following paragraphs. For the&#13;
discussion, alternative (c) of para. 2.01 will be considered as the case&#13;
without national ships and alternative (e) with owned national flag vessels&#13;
to carry part of the trade, as the alternative. An in-between arrangement&#13;
may in some cases be for a national shipping company to use time chartered or&#13;
leased vessels--alternative (d). Korea, for instance, has partly used this&#13;
latter approach; of the total shipping tonnage operated by Korean owners in&#13;
April 1979, 64% was owned, 24% involved bareboat charter with option to buy&#13;
and 12% was time chartered. Furthermore, about 46% of the planned increase&#13;
during 1977/78 - 1981 was expected to come through hire-purchase arrangements.&#13;
(ii) Saving Foreign Exchange&#13;
3.20      The potential for avoiding substantial foreign exchange payments&#13;
for maritime freight is often given by LDCs as one important reason for&#13;
investments in ocean-going shipping. This has been a major factor in the&#13;
cases of India and Korea. Although no comprehensive information is available&#13;
regarding the foreign exchange costs of the maritime transport of developing&#13;
countries' foreign trade, according to balance of payments data compiled by&#13;
the IMF, 78 developing countries paid 10,866 million SDR (about $13,200&#13;
million) for freighting by all modes their imports by foreign lines in 1975&#13;
2/. According to a recent World Bank Staff Working Paper: "Trade in Non-Factor&#13;
Services: Past Trends and Current Issues" 3/, imports of freight and insurance&#13;
1/   A related way of looking at such investments, suggested by Cohen&#13;
and Shneerson is in terms of domestic resource costs (D. Cohen and&#13;
D. Shneerson, "The Domestic Resource Costs of Establishing/Expanding&#13;
a National Fleet", Maritime Studies and Management, No. 3, 1976).&#13;

services in 1975 were the most important non-factor service imports in the&#13;
balance of payments of the Group of LDCs for which IMF data were available;&#13;
they accounted for about 35% of all non-factor service imports of these&#13;
countries. The cost of imported freight and insurance services for these&#13;
countries, US$14.1 billion, were about 10% of their trade import values;&#13;
they exceeded 13% for WDR regions 1, 2 and 5 and were less than 7% of regions&#13;
3 and 9 1/.&#13;
3.21      Although the total freight paid to national flag lines in a coun-&#13;
try's foreign trade is a gross foreign exchange saving, the net saving from&#13;
the national point of view will be significantly less depending on a number&#13;
of factors, including: (i) the type of vessels involved and their age and cost&#13;
structures under national and foreign flag, (ii) the extent to which the&#13;
vessel is acquired from abroad and the financing arrangements, (iii) the&#13;
extent to which national resources are used in its operation (crew, manage-&#13;
ment, repair facilities, etc.), (iv) the operating efficiency and level of&#13;
profitability, (v) the impact on freight rates, and (vi) the general conditions&#13;
on the particular trade routes in question.&#13;
3.22      The composition of costs for selected ship types under the U.K.&#13;
flag in 1976 are given in Table 20, while Table 21 indicates differences in&#13;
daily vessel costs for certain flags of registry. In the case of chartered&#13;
vessels use, there would normally not be any potential foreign exchange saving&#13;
on the crew account and only partly for management. On the other hand, there&#13;
is no direct acquisition and financing costs although an allowance for&#13;
capital costs will normally be included in the charter rate. In the case of&#13;
bareboat chartering with an option to buy, crew and management costs would&#13;
largely be national costs and the capital costs would be included in the&#13;
charter payments. As an example, an analysis of the contribution of British&#13;
shipping to the balance of payments is given in Table 22.&#13;
3.23      A hypothetical calculation for a liner vessel (Table 23), indicates&#13;
the variations in net savings depending on the assumptions used for (ii) and&#13;
(iv) above. Thus, on the assumptions that the trade was unprofitable, that the&#13;
ship was purchased abroad and paid for at 6% annually over a 25 year life, and&#13;
1/   These percentages have been estimated on the basis of the data given&#13;
in the report. The specific regions mentioned are:&#13;
WDR 1:  Low income Africa South of Sahara&#13;
2:  Low Middle and Intermediate Middle Income Africa South of Sahara&#13;
3:  Upper and Higher Income Africa South of Sahara--includes South&#13;
Africa&#13;
5:  Upper middle Income North Africa and Middle East.&#13;
9:  Upper Middle and Higher Income Asia and Pacific.   This covered&#13;
only Singapore and is not strictly comparable due to the open&#13;
registry, cross-trading nature of some of Singapores fleet.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
that the national resources used were crewi and management, the foreign&#13;
exchange saving was 5% of the gross freight, while, if the trade were profit-&#13;
able and the vessels purchased at home (or received as a gift), the saving&#13;
might be 35%.  The relativ'7 savings might be greater if, apart front crew&#13;
costs 1/ and management costs, a significant part of the costs of repair,&#13;
insurance, and some other items could also be procured nationally. It&#13;
should, however, be noted that in several developing countries, shipping&#13;
management may initially have to be partly obtained abroad and would therefore,&#13;
in part, involve a foreign exchange cost. While crew costs might largely be a&#13;
national currency cost, there could be partly offsetting foreign currency&#13;
losses if the employment of national crews on national flag vessels meant a&#13;
transfer of such crews from foreign flag vessels to national flag vessels&#13;
rather than the employment of previously unemployed persons or persons&#13;
locally employed in other national industries. If the national shipbuilding&#13;
or ship repair industries were competitive, their services would, at least&#13;
in part, be exported (e.g., used by visiting foreign lines) if not used by&#13;
the national shipping industry, and should in that case be considered as a&#13;
foreign exchange cost - at least equal to the likely international sales&#13;
price of the services, if the yards were working to capacity.&#13;
3.24      In the case of India, foreign shipping lines spent an estimated&#13;
25% of their freight earnings from Indian trades in India, while for Indian&#13;
shipping companies during 1973/74-1975/76, the disbursements abroad represented&#13;
less than half of their freight revenues (Table 25). SCI estimates its&#13;
foreign exchange savings equalled about 49% of its earnings from overseas&#13;
services or about Rs. 1,320 million ($154 million). The methodology used by&#13;
SCI (Annex 11) is interesting although it contains a major omission in that it&#13;
does not take into account capital costs in foreign currency. The same&#13;
limitation applies to the Indian data in Table 25 and also prevented any&#13;
proper analysis of the balance of payments effect of Korean shipping. Accord-&#13;
ing to the Indian National Shipowners- Association, the net foreign exchange&#13;
contribution of Indian shipping, after allowing for foreign currency capital&#13;
costs, would be about Rs. 150-200 crores ($180-240 million) per annum 2/.&#13;
According to the annual report of the Ceylon Shipping Corporation (CSC), the&#13;
foreign currency operating costs of CSC in 1974-76 varied between 48% and 60%&#13;
of their gross freight revenues while its net foreign exchange savings, after&#13;
interest, varied between 29% and 37%. In the case of Argentina, expenditures&#13;
abroad by Argentine flag vessels accounted for between 30 and 46% of their&#13;
revenues, although again it is not clearly indicated whether capital costs&#13;
have been included. Neither the CSC nor the Argentine data seem to take into&#13;
account foreign exchange earnings foregone from expenditures in their ports by&#13;
foreign vessels which might otherwise have occurred. In the Ivory Coast, the&#13;

the crew costs will be a foreign exchange cost since the crew will&#13;
spend part of their earnings abroad. Similarly, crews on foreign ships&#13;
most likely would spend some in the country as reflected in Table 23.&#13;

Ministry of Marine has estimated the net foreign exchange savings of that&#13;
country's merchant fleet at CFAF 2,000 million in 1977 (US$8 million) or about&#13;
10% of freight revenues of the national flag vessels. This comprehensive&#13;
analysis does, however, treat the acquisition cost of vessels as a foreign&#13;
exchange cost in the year of purchase (about US$20 million in 1977) and would&#13;
therefore tend to produce relatively low net foreign exchange savings during a&#13;
period of rapid expansion of the fleet when vessels are imported. The analysis&#13;
correctly treats expenses of national flag vessels in Ivory Coast ports as&#13;
foreign exchange costs equivalent to foreign exchange revenues foregone. In&#13;
the case of Norway, operating expenses abroad accounted for about 41% of the&#13;
gross foreign exchange freight earnings in 1972-1974, while interest on&#13;
foreign loans accounted for 6% and net ship imports (less export of second-hand&#13;
ships) for 8% 1/. About 90% of the Norwegian ocean-going fleet was engaged in&#13;
cross-trading. On the other hand, if the national flag vessels are operated&#13;
at a deficit, use few national resources, and involve expensive vessels&#13;
purchased abroad on relatively hard financing terms, the net foreign exchange&#13;
savings could be negative. Table 26 sets out a format for analyzing the&#13;
balance of payments effects of a national shiipping line.&#13;
3.25      If the national currency is overvalued, the value of the net&#13;
foreign currency savings would be understated if the official exchange&#13;
rate is used without adjustment. Furthermore, if the investment in national&#13;
flag vessels results in reduced freight rates and increased exports, these&#13;
would represent further foreign exchange benefits.&#13;
3.26      Although significant gross foreign exchange earnings or savings may&#13;
be obtained from investments in shipping, the net savings will, as discussed&#13;
above, be smaller, although still potentially interesting. Notwithstanding&#13;
the data problems, it would appear that in most cases some foreign exchange&#13;
savings would result. This would, howev-r, have to be considered on a case-&#13;
by-case basis by the countries considering investing in shipping. Such an&#13;
analysis should, in addition to an estimation of the net foreign exchange&#13;
savings of national flag vessels (i.e., gross earnings less foreign exchange&#13;
expenditures and less foreign exchange earnings foregone), also include (i)&#13;
the foreign exchange savings which might be obtained from alternative uses&#13;
of the national resoturces which might be invested in shipping, (ii) shadow&#13;
pricing if appropriate, (iii) the extent to which in a given case foreign&#13;
loans or credits may be available for shipping but not for other purposes,&#13;
(iv) the fact that only a small portion of the vessel cost will normally have&#13;
to be paid initially, and (v) the fact that vessels are movable assets with&#13;
an international market, although at a fluctuating price level.&#13;
(iii) Effect on Freight Costs and Trade&#13;
3.27      The potential for bringing about lower freight charges and/or&#13;
improved service is often cited as reasons for LDCs investing in national&#13;
merchant marines. Information to substantiate these claims is scattered and&#13;
impressionistic. In the case of India, it was claimed that national flag&#13;

vessels had had some positive effect and individual e-:amplls were mentioned&#13;
(see paras. 3.31, 3.32 and 3.33 below.). However, no compiehensive analysis&#13;
was available. In considering the potential effect of national flag vessels&#13;
on freight costs, it is necessary to distinguish once more between three types&#13;
of shipping services: (i) liner or scheduled operation within a shipping&#13;
conference, (ii) liner operation outside the conferences, and (iii) bulk&#13;
shipping. The following discussion will be in general terms as necessary&#13;
statistical data are not available.&#13;
3.28      Before discussing the different types of shipping, it may be useful&#13;
to consider briefly whether, in principle, there are any general reasons why&#13;
ships from some LDCs should be able to operate at lower costs than those of&#13;
developed countries. An important cost is labor, covering both crews and&#13;
management. This would be particularly significant and generally favorable&#13;
for the LDCs in liner shipping and could become increasingly important in&#13;
bulk shipping if open registry shipping were curtailed through international&#13;
agreement. It should, however, be noted that in the case of some LDCs, the&#13;
potential advantages in terms of lower unit wage rates (including social&#13;
charges, etc.) may be partly offset by larger crew sizes. The relative&#13;
importance of crew and administration costs in the total daily costs vary&#13;
markedly between vessel types, being highest for liner vessels, tramp vessels,&#13;
small reefers, and small bulk carriers (including tankers) and lowest for con-&#13;
tainer vessels and other high technology vessels such as LNG carriers or very&#13;
large bulk carriers, as indicated in Table 20. This Table assumes cost under&#13;
British flag operations using British officers and Asian seamen (ratings) and&#13;
reflects 1976 cost levels. Such costs might also be lower for newly-built&#13;
vessels than for vessels purchased second-hand or for vessels which have&#13;
undergone conversion to reduce their operating costs and increase their&#13;
earning capacity. As can be seen from the Table, crew and administration&#13;
costs ranged from almost 30% for a small product carrier to 2% for a LNG&#13;
vessel; due to the sharp increase in bunker costs since 1976 the percentages&#13;
may now be somewhat lower. According to a 1976 Swedish estimate, crew costs&#13;
for a liner vessel or small bulk carrier under the British, Norwegian or&#13;
Swedish flag would be two to three times the cost under the Liberian flag&#13;
without ITF agreement (Table 21). The difference is smaller, but still&#13;
significant, if Greek crew costs are considered. More recent data indicate&#13;
that the total monthly crew cost for ratings in mid-1979 was between US$2,000&#13;
and US$2,500 for Japanese, Norwegian and American; about US$1,900 for British;&#13;
about US$950 for Greek and about US$600 for Indian ratings 1/. The latter&#13;
might be comparable to an efficient LDC shipowner. Efficient LDC shipowners&#13;
should therefore have a special potential for low cost operations in the&#13;
relatively more labor-intensive parts of shipping. They might find it&#13;
economical to use relatively more labor and less capital-intensive vessels on&#13;
particular trades than would shipowners from the higher labor cost countries&#13;
although, in practice, the best balance would have to be evaluated separately&#13;
for each trade. Consideration would also have to be given to the extent to&#13;
which lower crew costs in the LDCs might be offset by higher financing costs&#13;
or less advantageous tax provisions than those available to its foreign&#13;

competitors. Several countries, including developed countries, give various&#13;
forms of financial assistance to their shipping industries in an effort to&#13;
improve their competitive position 1/,&#13;
3.29      It is not possible within the scope of this paper to deal exhaus-&#13;
tively with the question of economies of scale in shipping. 'However, two&#13;
aspects may be mentioned briefly, i.e., economies of scale associated with&#13;
vessel size and economies associated with number of vessels operated by a&#13;
single company. In principle, there are considerable economies of scale in&#13;
bulk shipping from increased vessel sizes, particularly in the long-distance,&#13;
large-volume trades. However, the extent to which increasing vessel sizes can&#13;
be economically used in particular trades depends, apart from vessel costs, on&#13;
the trade volumes involved and the capacity of existing port and storage&#13;
facilities or the cost of new facilities. These factors are even more impor-&#13;
tant for liner vessels. For both liner and bulk vessels there may be a trade-&#13;
off between decreasing ship operating costs per ton-mile from fully used larger&#13;
vessels and increasing port and storage costs. It is, however, likely that&#13;
increasing bunker fuel prices and the reduced bunker costs per ton of cargo&#13;
for larger vessels may gradually result in increased vessel sizes, particularly&#13;
in the average size of bulk vessels. In liner trades this could also increase&#13;
the use of large container vesels for main-line port trades, supplemented by&#13;
feeder services.&#13;
3.30      As far as is known, no comprehensive and conclusive study has been&#13;
made of the economies of scale for shipping companies neither with regard to&#13;
the number of liner vessels operated on a particular trade route nor the&#13;
number of bulk vessels. The available evidence tends to indicate that there&#13;
are some economies of scale, particularly with regard to marketing and company&#13;
overhead, as well as the possibility of more specialized services. In liner&#13;
trades a certain minimum frequency may be necessary to attract regular cus-&#13;
tomers; while in the bulk trades certain types of contracting, e.g., contracts&#13;
of affreightment, require a number of vessels for operational flexibility.&#13;
However, some of the potential benefits from larger scale operations may be&#13;
obtained through pooling arrangements or other forms of joint operation as&#13;
well as the use of outside specialized services. The successful operation of&#13;
a number of small companies with one to four vessels, for instance in Greece&#13;
and Norway, would tend to indicate that scale may not be a definitive obstacle&#13;
for small well-run shipping companies 2/. It should, however, be noted that&#13;

32 discusses these aspects further. Ferguson et al., The Economic Value&#13;
of the United States Merchant Marine, Evanston, 1961, although somewhat&#13;
dated now, also concluded that shipping was not characterized by large&#13;
economies of scale. It should, however, be recognized that there are&#13;
also a number of very large companies. Exxon Corportion, for instance, at&#13;
the end of 1976 reportedly owned, through various affiliates, 154 vessels&#13;
totalling 16 million dwt (United States Department of Commerce, Maritime&#13;
Administration, Foreign Flag Merchant Ships Owned by U.S. Parent Companies,&#13;
U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., 1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
even a relatively small company with, say, three handy-sized bulk carriers&#13;
might require an investment of about US$45 million, or an equity financing of&#13;
about US$13 million, based on mid-1979 new-building prices. For more capital-&#13;
intensive vessels such as container vessels, LNG vessels, etc., the investments&#13;
for a single vessel could be of the same order of magnitude. According to&#13;
one estimate, the total cost of instituting a basic container service on an&#13;
important trade route was between US$120 and US$200 million in the early&#13;
1970s 1/.&#13;
3.31      In the case of a national shipping line joining an existing con-&#13;
ference, it becones bound by the conference rules and must charge the same&#13;
rates as other conference members. The voting power of the line in conference&#13;
affairs depends on the organization of the conference, the number of lines and&#13;
their relative voting rights. One vote per line appears to be fairly common&#13;
although conferences may tend towards consensus decisions rather than voting.&#13;
Even if a national line has costs below the average of the conference members,&#13;
it is not necessarily clear whether its participation in the shipping conference&#13;
will have a downward effect on the general level of freight rates in the&#13;
trade or just result in higher profit for the line 2/. On the other hand a&#13;
high cost national line, at least initially, might encourage a conference to&#13;
maintain or increase freight rates to protect the national line-s financial&#13;
viability. Governments and public sector shippers might also be less inclined&#13;
to resist conference rate increases if the survival of a national line, espe-&#13;
cially a public sector line, were at stake. It has been argued, e.g., in&#13;
India (by both shipowners and shippers), and by UNCTAD 3/, that national lines&#13;
may, however, have had more influence on, or been more sympathetic to, requests&#13;
from nationals for promotional freight rates for new items, or lower freight&#13;
rates or smaller increases for individual, important, export commodities, the&#13;
competitive position of which might be negatively affected by higher rates.&#13;
Clearly, as long as the rates were above marginal cost, it would be in the&#13;
interest of conference members not to lose a particular trade. It has also&#13;
been argued that national lines might be more sensitive to special service&#13;
improvements requested by national shippers. Access to the minutes of&#13;
conference meetings on freight rate questions would be necessary for any&#13;
authoritative analysis of the effect of particular national lines on confer-&#13;
ence freight rates and also on conference service matters. Such access is&#13;

2/   In the case of India, it was mentioned that on several occasions the&#13;
Indian lines had been instrumental in obtaining lower than originally&#13;
planned general freight rate increases, e.g., in the India/Europe trade,&#13;
and ensuring a longer period between freight rate increases. T.K.&#13;

not readily available. However, well-organized shipper councils or trade&#13;
associations, and other efforts towards setting up a counter-balancing&#13;
force to the conference or encouraging competition may be alternative ways of&#13;
achieving the desired objectives. Even if a national shipping line exists,&#13;
such organizations have-a part to play by representing the interests of&#13;
shippers as in Korea and India. In the latter case, the Freight Investigation&#13;
Bureau also appears to have played a useful role. In the case of West Africa,&#13;
the Institut de Documentation de Recherche et d'Etudes Maritimes (I.D.R.E.M.)&#13;
in the Ivory Coast has estimated that, through a strengthened bargaining&#13;
position, the region has avoided conference freight rate increases totalling&#13;
some US$350 million between 1977 and 1979, although the basis for this esti-&#13;
mate is not known.&#13;
3.32      It would appear that liner operations outside the shipping confer-&#13;
ences are rarely undertaken by LDC companies on their main trades. This is&#13;
probably because they find it easier and less risky to share in the conference.&#13;
In the case of India, the liner companies appear generally to operate within&#13;
the conferences although it was reported that this is considered on a trade-by-&#13;
tra&amp;'e basis and that in the India/US trade, two Indian lines had left the&#13;
conference due to a disagreement over a freight rate increase which they con-&#13;
sidered excessive. The Convention on a Code of Conduct for Liner Conferences&#13;
is likely to encourage conference membership by LDC lines and generally&#13;
strengthen the conference system, possibly through increased use of pooling&#13;
agreements as one way of implementing cargo sharing. The extent to which&#13;
participation in non-conference liner operations might be economical from a&#13;
country's point of view would depend, to a considerable extent, upon&#13;
the degree to which the line could operate profitably at lower-than-conference&#13;
rates, or force the conferences to reduce their rates, rationalize their&#13;
operations, or otherwise bring their services more in line with the needs of&#13;
the trade than could be done previously. Study of major trades would be&#13;
required to determine this. Despite lower freight rates, shippers may often&#13;
be reluctant to use non-conference services, due to the lower frequency of&#13;
service and port coverage which these normally provide as compared with&#13;
conference lines as a group. In the case of India, it was reported that many&#13;
shippers who had previously taken advantage of lower cost non-conference lines&#13;
were returning to the conference lines following a number of cargo losses from&#13;
a few "fly-by-night", non-conference operators in 1978. The lower freight&#13;
rates of non-conference lines could also, depending on the specific conference&#13;
agreements, be partly off-set by loss of loyalty rebates, or higher freight&#13;
rates if shippers had to use conference lines for part of their needs or, at a&#13;
later date, if the non-conference line withdrew its services.&#13;
3.33      Investments in bulk shipping by developing countries may reduce&#13;
directly or indirectly the freight costs under three circumstances. Firstly,&#13;
this can occur if the national line can operate efficiently and offer competi-&#13;
tive rates as compared with those obtainable from other sources. As many bulk&#13;
trades use identical types of ships with similar fixed costs, crew costs may&#13;
be the deciding factor, together with taxes. High crew costs appear for&#13;
instance to have been a major reason for the use of so-called "shikumisen"&#13;
(tied-in) vessels in the Japanese bulk trades. The "shikumisen" vessels are&#13;
generally built in Japan, financed largely under the regular shipbuilding&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
program and chartered on a long-term basis by Japanese shipowners, from&#13;
foreign companies, particularly in Hong Kong or Singapore. For countries with&#13;
low crew costs this could therefore be an important consideration favoring&#13;
owned vessels over chartered vessels (excluding bareboat charters and some&#13;
leasing) which would be manned by the foreign owner. Secondly, as indicated&#13;
earlier, the greatest possibilities for achieving long-term reductions in&#13;
transport costs may exist in the use of neo-bulk shipping, i.e., bulking of&#13;
consignments of commodities which are presently shipped by liner services.&#13;
A 1975 study of the possibility of bulking rubber shipments from Malaysia to&#13;
Europe concluded that substantial savings could be achieved by actually&#13;
inviting tenders 1/. An important institutional aspect was that the Malaysian&#13;
Rubber Exchange and Licensing Board had the necessary power to enter into&#13;
contract shipping arrangements on behalf of the industry and to ensure that&#13;
the cargo would be shipped on contract vessels. It is possible that the&#13;
existence of suitable national flag vessels might facilitate the transfer to&#13;
bulk shipping of commodities presently shipped by liners, but the same might&#13;
be the case using chartered vessels. Thirdly, the existence of national bulk&#13;
shipping may also improve the knowledge of LDCs which are important exporters&#13;
or importers of major bulk commodities and thereby facilitate agreements with&#13;
the producers/buyers/sellers of these products and ensure the best possible&#13;
prices. Although concrete information is difficult to find, allegations have&#13;
been made that in the case of some major bulk commodities, higher-than-&#13;
prevailing market freight rates occasionally have been used in deriving f.o.b.&#13;
prices by deducting "assumed" freight costs from competitive c.i.f. prices.&#13;
It is also alleged that the exporting countries have not participated in the&#13;
economies achieved from the use of larger, more economical bulk vessels.&#13;
Again, at least part of this advantage could be obtained from the use of&#13;
chartered vessels. However, this would depend on who controls the shipping&#13;
arrangements and the relative elasticities of supply and demand.&#13;
3.34      Apart from a potentially favorable effect on freight costs, invest-&#13;
ments in national-flag vessels may assist foreign trade by: (i) providing&#13;
service to areas not already covered or only covered by transhipment at higher&#13;
costs, where there may be potential for beneficial trade or, (ii) promoting&#13;
national products abroad as part of the line-s own business promotion services.&#13;
Specific cases have, for instance, been cited where Indian shipping lines have&#13;
been instrumental in opening up new trades, particularly to other developing&#13;
countries (e.g., Latin America and West Africa) and to CPEs on the basis of&#13;
bilateral agreements. It was also mentioned that national lines had continued&#13;
to serve congested ports which foreign lines had avoided, e.g., to Nigeria&#13;
and the Gulf area as well as certain Indian ports during periods of acute&#13;
congestion. It has also been argued that national liner companies might be&#13;
more cooperative towards national shippers, e.g., be ready or obligated to&#13;
accept less desirable commodities and to call at marginal ports 2/. If the&#13;

type of vessels, or shipping technology, used by foreign shipping lines&#13;
serving particular trades of a country is not the most economical from a&#13;
total transport point of view, including requirements for port, storage and&#13;
inland transport facilities as well as the ships, an investment in more&#13;
appropriate vessels could possibly result in lower overall transport costs.&#13;
This would naturally have to be considered on a case-by-case basis, including&#13;
to what extent the potential benefits could be obtained through chartered&#13;
vessels or only through owned vessels.&#13;
3.35      Very little comparative information is available on the above&#13;
points. Although specific instances exist, e.g., in India, as mentioned in&#13;
para. 3.31, where the introduction or existence of national flag vessels&#13;
reportedly have reduced the freight costs on particular commodities or helped&#13;
avoid or modify freight increases. The opposite might also be the case; this&#13;
is more likely if the national flag vessels are not operated efficiently.&#13;
Promotion of national bulk shipping through restrictive measures such as cargo&#13;
reservations could contribute to inefficient operations and increased freight&#13;
costs, particularly during periods of depressed freight rates. One way of&#13;
minimizing this danger while still providing some assistance to national, bulk&#13;
shipping companies, is used in India where a Government Agency (Transchart)&#13;
invites bids for the transport of Government bulk commodities and gives Indian&#13;
vessels preference, only if their rates are equal to or lower than those&#13;
quoted by foreign owners. Careful analysis of the existing trading arrange-&#13;
ments, shipping services used and their operations as well as the likely costs&#13;
of national flag shipping operations would clearly be required to determine&#13;
whether, in a particular case, establishment or expansion of national flag&#13;
shipping would help reduce freight costs and promote a country's foreign trade&#13;
and to what extent these benefits could be achieved through the use of char-&#13;
tered vessels and/or institutional changes.&#13;
(iv) Employment&#13;
3.36      Although investme'ats by developing countries in shipping may in-&#13;
crease the employment opporcunities both on board and on shore, they cannot&#13;
generally be justified solely in terms of employment created. As indicated&#13;
in paragraphs 3.40 - 3.46 shipping is, despite large variations, a rela-&#13;
tively capital intensive industry in terms of capital cost per job. Further-&#13;
more, shipping requires certain skills which, although available in some&#13;
LDCs, are unlikely to be readily available in many others without considerable&#13;
expenditures on training and, in the case of officers, considerable time also.&#13;
According to an IMCO estimate, the cost of training a deck or radio cadet is&#13;
some US$6-7,000 and that of a navigator or engineering officer US$10-12,000 1/.&#13;
Exceptions to shortage of skilled seamen may exist in certain LDCs with an&#13;
established maritime tradition due to a long coastline, established fishing&#13;
industry and/or coastal shipping. This could provide a ready basis for&#13;
recruitment but does not obviate the need for shore and shipboard training.&#13;

3.37      Although LDCs with low-cost, trained, maritime personnel will have&#13;
a considerable advantage as compared with other countries in establishing or&#13;
expanding their merchant marines, it should be borne in mind that employment&#13;
on board foreign vessels, can provide significant earnings for some countries&#13;
without direct investments in shipping. It is, for instance, reported that&#13;
in the case of the Philippines, 90 manning agencies supply over 40,000 seamen&#13;
of all grades to foreign flag ships, making crew remittances the sixth&#13;
biggest dollar earner in the country. Exxon reportedly is partly replacing&#13;
Spanish and Italian crews with those from the Philippines or Korea 1/. The&#13;
employment of Korean seamen on overseas vessels has increased rapidly in&#13;
recent years to 16,200 persons in 1978 remitting about US$100 million to Korea&#13;
annually. In the case of the Philippines, the foreign exchange earnings from&#13;
seamen employed on foreign vessels was about US$120 million annually. Substan-&#13;
tial remittances were also received by India as some 20,000 Indian seamen&#13;
were, in early 1979, registered and about 11,000 actually employed in jobs on&#13;
For comparison it can be mentioned that there were about 11,400 jobs on&#13;
Indian ships plus 4,500 shore-based employees of the Indian lines. While, in&#13;
the case of some developed countries, the employment of foreigners on national&#13;
flag vessels may be restricted or even prohibited, this is not the case with&#13;
open registry countries. According to a 1979 survey of Liberian flaT vessels,&#13;
some 86,000 seamen from about 100 countries were employed on these vessels&#13;
with 62% coming from LDCs and 38% from developed market economy countries 2/.&#13;
3.38      Although they may be very beneficial in terms of remittances, employ-&#13;
ment opportunities on foreign ships could, depending on the supply situation,&#13;
also make it more difficult for national lines in some LDCs to retain crew,&#13;
particularly officers, and put an upward pressure on their crew costs. This&#13;
appears for instance in part to be the case in India and Korea. India has&#13;
been opposed to the efforts of the ITF to increase wages for seamen, particu-&#13;
larly on open registry ships, as have the unions of other developing countries&#13;
in Asia 3/.&#13;
3.39      Employment in shipping, even if of limited overall importance, may,&#13;
however, have somewhat greater regional importance as the seamen may come from&#13;
rural coastal areas with few employment alternatives.    Employment in the&#13;
national shipping administration or directly related service industries&#13;
increases the total employment opportunities.&#13;

3.40      International shipping is generally considered a relatively capital&#13;
intensive industry although the capital invested per employee differs markedly&#13;
for different types of shipping, and also on. whether new or second-hand vessels&#13;
are used. Capital investment per employee is also affected by vessel crewing&#13;
patterns, national labor policies, the relative portion of onshore to onboard&#13;
employment, which differ from company to company, country to country and by&#13;
type of shipping. Onshore employment, for instance, is normally significantly&#13;
higher for liner services than for bulk services.&#13;

increased between 1966 and 1975 from E 28,000 to E 51,000 or by 81% in constant&#13;
1970 prices the investment per employee in shipping in 1975 was slightly less&#13;
than in electricity, gas and water but substantially higher than in other&#13;
major industries (Table 27). In Norway, shipping is a capital intensive&#13;
industry accounting for some 9% of the capital stock. It also accounted for&#13;
about a fourth of the capital depreciation as compared with 3.3% of employment&#13;
and 5.2% net national product in 1974. The real capital per employee in&#13;
ocean-going shipping was NKr. 925,000 (US$160,000) as compared with NKr.400,000&#13;
(US$70,000) for five major industrial concerns in 1973 1/. For a modern&#13;
Norwegian tanker, the investment cost per job would be considerably higher--&#13;
some NKr. 6-10 million (US$1.2-2.0 million).&#13;
3.42      The net (unrevalued) fixed assets per employee of the Shipping&#13;
Corporation of India in 1978 wa about $58,000, as compared with an average&#13;
of $5,000 per employee for 22 other major Government of India undertakings.&#13;
The corresponding figures for total capital employed per employee was $57,000&#13;
and $7,000, respectively. In both cases SCI had the highest capital/labor&#13;
ratio followed by aluminum and petrochemical companies (Table 28). The Ceylon&#13;
Shipping Corporation-s net fixed assets (not revalued) per employee were&#13;
US$21,000 at the end of 1976 while in the case of 26 state industrial corpora-&#13;
tions in Sri Lanka, the average investment employed in production was US$5,000&#13;
equivalent per employee. For Korea's ocean-going shipping industry, the&#13;
average net fixed assets (not revalued) per employee was $48,000 in 1977.&#13;
From a sample of 32 sub-loans in that country, the average appraisal estimate&#13;
of investments per incremental job for two marine transport projects were&#13;
$155,000 and $234,000 respectively as compared with a weighted average&#13;
for the 32 sub-loans of $43,000. For a different sample of sub-projects in&#13;
the same country, the simple average appraisal estimate of investment per&#13;
incremental job was $115,000 for 13 shipping projects and $39,000 for 33 other&#13;
projects. The average investment per incremental job in 195 sub-projects&#13;
focussing primarily on small and medium industrial projects was US$11,000&#13;
(Table 29).&#13;
3.43      Table 30 indicates the range in ±nvcatment per crew member for&#13;
selected new-building and second-hand vessels based on estimated market prices&#13;
as of end-1974 (period of high prices) and end-1977 (period of relatively&#13;
depressed prices).  The Table indicates the differences which may exist,&#13;

depending on whether vessels were acquired at "low" or "high" prices, the&#13;
time factor, and much lower capital cost per job for second-hand vessels than&#13;
new-buildings. Crew sizes are indicated on an assumed level as well as a&#13;
higher level which might appertain to some low crew-cost countries. According&#13;
to IMCO, the average number of personnel for manning ships in OECD countries&#13;
is 34 compared with 50-57 in developing countries 1/. This difference may, in&#13;
part, be due to larger crew complements per se which may in part offset the&#13;
advantage LDCs might have on account of crew cost, and in part to relatively&#13;
older and less automated vessels being used by several LDCs. It should, how-&#13;
ever, be noted that in several developed market economy countries, experiments&#13;
are presently under way with greatly reduced crews on the more automated&#13;
vessels. As the crew sizes do not increase in relation to ves5el size,&#13;
relative crew costs generally decline with vessel size as indicated by the&#13;
following example for tanker vessels 2/:&#13;

3.44      Onshore employment and back-up staff have been ignored in Table 30&#13;
as they will vary markedly from country to country and service to service.&#13;
In Norway and Korea, with large bulk fleets, seaborne employment was about 86%&#13;
and 75% of the combined seaborne and direct onshore employment in shipping in&#13;
1977 and 1978 respectively. In the case of the Argentine liner company ELMA,&#13;
onboard employment accounted in 1976 for 65%. On the basis of assumed&#13;
crew size and the depressed prices prevailing at the end of 1977, the invest-&#13;
ment cost per crew member at the end of 1977 ranged as indicated in Table 30&#13;
from about US$20,000 on second-hand liner vessels (US$0.7 million per vessel)&#13;
and US$34,000 on a small second-hand tanker (US$1.2 million per vessel) to&#13;
about US$1.8 million on a new container vessel (US$52 million per vessel) and&#13;
almost US$5 million on a new LNG vessel (US$115 million per vessel).&#13;
3.45      Table 31 presents some information regarding the average investment&#13;
(mostly not revalued) per employee in selected shipping companies or indus-&#13;
tries at the end of 1976 (or other period for which the information was&#13;
available) and shows the great variation which exists depending on vessel&#13;
types and age - ranging from an original acquisition cost of US$27,000 per&#13;
employee in the case of Ceylon Shipping Corporation, with mostly old liner&#13;
vessels, to about US$230,000 in the case of the relatively modern and capital&#13;
intensive Norwegian fleet. These figures refer to direct employment only and&#13;

do not take into account indirect employment in the national shipping adminis-&#13;
tration or industries related to shipping such as shipbuilding, repairs,&#13;
insurance, etc.&#13;
3.46      A second measure of capital intensity is the ratio of capital&#13;
investment to output (revenues). According to the 1968 UNCTAD report&#13;
"Establishment or Expansion of Merchant Marines in Developing Countries",&#13;
the net incremental capital/output ratios (ICOR) in shipping at that time&#13;
appeared to be betwreen 5:1 and 7:1 although the ratio for a ten-year old&#13;
vessel might be more like 3:1. Comparable current ICORs are not available.&#13;
However, in the case of the two new small bulk carriers financed by a Korean&#13;
DFC, the incremental capital/output ratios at appraisal were put respectively&#13;
at 2.1:1 and 2.3:1. This compared with an average capital/output ratio of&#13;
1.86:1 for this DFC's projects in 1977. Table 32 indicates that for a&#13;
number of developing countries the average (not incremental) capital/output&#13;
ratio was considerably lower, ranging from 0.8:1 to 4.0:1 on the basis of&#13;
original vessel acquisition costs. Simple new ships, and used ships, gener-&#13;
ally require less capital per unit of output than more complex new ships.&#13;
3.47      The above data tend to confirm that despite wide variations, ship-&#13;
ping is a relatively capital-intensive sector 1/. From the point of view of&#13;
capital investments per employee, LDCs should consider entering or expanding&#13;
their merchant marines only after having given careful attention to the&#13;
expected employment benefits from shipping as compared with possible other&#13;
alternatives. It should, however, be noted that it may be easier to obtain&#13;
foreign financing for shipping than for many other industries as several&#13;
countries subsidize their shipbuilding industries. This should be considered&#13;
when comparing alternative profitable investments. Such financing would&#13;
commonly cover 70-80% of new ship costs but higher percentages may now be&#13;
available for LDCs 2/. Careful analysis should also be given in shipping&#13;
feasibility studies to the relatively-low capital costs for smaller, second-&#13;
hand, liner or bulk vessels to see whether these capital cost advantages are&#13;
offset by the higher operating costs (particularly maintenance and repairs, as&#13;
well as fuel) which these vessels are likely to have as compared with new&#13;
vessels, taking into account the greater difficulty of obtaining financing&#13;
for second-hand vessels. Conversion of existing vessels might also&#13;
be considered as a way of modernizing existing vessels to reduce their&#13;
operating costs or increase their earning capacity. Bareboat chartering or&#13;
leasing with option to buy is a possible way of overcoming this latter point.&#13;
The question of standardization and suitability for the particular trade,&#13;
1/   According to one estimate the total investment in new ships delivered&#13;
between January 1, 1970 and December 31, 1978 was $120,000 million,&#13;
while the likely annual investments in the early 1980s were estimated to&#13;
be at least $15,000 million (paper presented by Mr. Slater and repro-&#13;
duced in BIMCO Bulletin, III, 1979, pp. 5180-86).&#13;
2/   Alternative sources of ship finance, including the important OECD&#13;
understanding on Export Credit for ships are discussed in Chapter IV.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
naturally also needs careful consideration including the likely degree of&#13;
containerization in liner trades. The cost data should be converted to a&#13;
cost per cargo ton per annum basis to reflect possible differences in vessel&#13;
sizes, speed and loading/discharging rates, etc.&#13;
3.48      As far as is known, no comparison has been made between the skill&#13;
requirements in shipping and other industries; but shipping, with its&#13;
relatively heavy capital investment and the trends towards more automation,&#13;
requires considerable and increasing levels of skills both onboard and&#13;
onshore. This'is particularly true in the case of the more sophisticated&#13;
vessels. Normal or standard training requirements are generally dealt with&#13;
at the national level (both government and individual companies). In some&#13;
cases, special training courses are also organized at the regional and inter-&#13;
national levels. Certification requirements, until recently, have been dealt&#13;
with at the national level but an IMCO conference in July 1978 unanimously&#13;
adopted the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification&#13;
and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978.&#13;
3.49      According to a survey of maritime developments in Commonwealth&#13;
developing countries, "progress is now seriously held back because of a very&#13;
severe shortage of trained and experienced people for either seagoing or&#13;
shore-based jobs, at every level" 1/. The IMCO convention requires the&#13;
parties, in consultation with IMCO, to promote support for countries request-&#13;
ing technical assistance for training (see also para. 5.11). The Bank is&#13;
financing the rehabilitation of the Indonesian Maritime Academy and has also&#13;
assisted such training in Korea. Developments in shipping technology in&#13;
recent years have not only tended to increase training and retraining require-&#13;
ments but also to reduce the average crew sizes of the fleets of developed&#13;
countries (Table 33) and also to increase the ratio of officers to ratings&#13;
(Table 34) and the needed skill requirements.&#13;
3.50      Development of required maritime skills will probably be easier&#13;
in countries which already have a maritime orientation from coastal or&#13;
inland waterways transport or have fishing. As regards the management level,&#13;
bulk shipping, particularly under long-term contracts, requires a smaller&#13;
management team than liner shipping. Particular skills, whether crew or&#13;
management, can be obtained from abroad at a cost, or through joint ventures&#13;
or some other form of association with established foreign shipping interests.&#13;
Such joint ventures or associations might also involve cooperation between&#13;
two or more developing countries as in the case of the Irano-Hind Shipping&#13;
Company or on a regional or sub-regional basis as discussed further in&#13;
section D below.&#13;
3.51      Investments in international shipping by LDCs are not likely to&#13;
become important sources of employment.   Nevertheless, it is possible that&#13;
for a specific area in a country, such employment could be of great regional&#13;
importance, particularly if shipping investments resulted in "upstream"&#13;
employment opportunities in ship repairing or shipbuilding which are rela-&#13;
tively more labor intensive. Investments in national flag vessels for&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
overseas trades may result in lower freight costs than would otherwise be the&#13;
case. This could result in a multiplier effect of increased exports and,&#13;
thereby, increase employment in the production of the commodities concerned.&#13;
While this might also be achieved by the use of chartered vessels, these would&#13;
not provide onboard employment or as many onshore jobs.&#13;
(v) Shipping Investments and Related Sectors&#13;
3.52      Investment in shipping may, in appropriate cases, create further&#13;
employment and output in related sectors. The extent of these economic&#13;
linkages will depend largely on how far shipping is planned as an integral&#13;
part of the economy and can draw on, and provide service for, other&#13;
sectors of the economy. The main economic linkages between shiDping and&#13;
other sectors of the economy, apart from the employment of crew and onshore&#13;
personnel, could be ship repair and shipbuilding and their supply industries&#13;
(e.g., iron and steel, various equipment an' machinery industries, paint,&#13;
furnishings, etc.) as well as other support industries such as insurance,&#13;
finance, communications, provisioning, ship classification, and maritime&#13;
training. All of these activities tend to be more labor-intensive than&#13;
modern shipping. Ideally, therefore, the existence or possible development&#13;
of such related industries should be evaluated in connection with any con-&#13;
sideration of major investments in shipping, taking into account the economies&#13;
of scale which may be involved, i.e., for shipbuilding, and the resources&#13;
available in the country. A clear, although possibly unique, example of this&#13;
approach appears to have been Korea.&#13;
3.53      In Korea, shipping forms an integral part of the national economy&#13;
and planning since the country s export-led development pattern depends&#13;
both on the import of large volumes of raw materials for the steel industry&#13;
and basic heavy industry, particularly shipbuilding, and on the export of&#13;
manufactured products to many different markets 1/. Shipping, particularly&#13;
bulk shipping, provides the transport for these essential imports and is,&#13;
itself, a customer of the shipbuilding industry. As exports have increased,&#13;
investments have been made in liner vessels to meet part of the transport&#13;
requirements. Korean shipping, by focusing initially on bulk shipping, has&#13;
been different from that of most LDCs which have focussed, at least initially,&#13;
on liner shipping.&#13;
3.54      A second example where the development of shipping seems to have&#13;
been developed as an integral part of the country's economic development is&#13;
Brazil. It has developed a liner fleet to serve its foreign trade in liner&#13;
goods, partly through cargo reservation measures and bulk shipping industry to&#13;
1/   The Korean input-output Tables for 1975, before the most recent expansion&#13;
of the shipbuilding industry, show that the main linkages between water&#13;
transport and other sectors were with petroleum products, non-metallic&#13;
minerals, wholesale and retail trade, business consumption, road trans-&#13;
port, ships, rolled steel, loading and unloading, financing, communica-&#13;
tions, etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
serve its important imports of petroleum and exports of iron ore, partly on the&#13;
basis of combined operations. It has also built up an important shipbuilding&#13;
and ship repairing industry. The Brazilian shipbuilding industry, which in&#13;
early 1980 ranked second only to Japan's in terms of tonnage on order, serves&#13;
the Brazilian shipping industry and earns foreign exchange as an export&#13;
industry 1/. No economic or financial analyses of the Brazilian shipping&#13;
and shipbuilding industries or of the effects of the various cargo reservation&#13;
and tax measures used is presently available.&#13;
3.55      In the event that the existence of national shipping lines in&#13;
particular instances results in lower freight costs for particular imported&#13;
raw materials or export commodities, this could, depending on the relative&#13;
elasticities and freight factors involved, result in some expansion in these&#13;
industries and thus be an indirect linkage effect. This could also be true&#13;
if a national line helps open up new trade routes and new markets.&#13;
(vi) Security of Service and Non-economic Factors&#13;
3.56      The questions of security of service and non-economic considerations&#13;
are grouped together here because the security of service considerations blend&#13;
into national defence considerations. The availability of shipping services&#13;
to meet part of a country's foreign trade needs in case of war or other&#13;
emergencies has been a consideration in connection with the development of&#13;
many national merchant marines. At periods of high worldwide demand for&#13;
shipping services and high freight rates (not necessarily related to wars)&#13;
LDCs with small trade volumes might find the availability of shipping services&#13;
greatly reduced. This might be particularly so for essential imports when&#13;
vessels are transferred to higher volume trade routes and chartered vessels&#13;
might only be available at higher rates, if at all. The question of security&#13;
of service, for instance, appears to have been a major consideration in the&#13;
development of Korean shipping, given the country-s geographical position, its&#13;
dependence on imports of large volumes of raw materials for its industry, as&#13;
well as the growing importance of exports to many different markets. The&#13;
question of a reliable transport service for a large proportion of essential&#13;
oil imports was, apart from foreign exchange savings, a consideration in the&#13;
Bank's 1972 loan to India for four crude oil carriers and two product carriers.&#13;
While defence considerations fall outside the normal economic evaluation, they&#13;
have been a very important consideration in the development or expansion of&#13;
national merchant marines (e.g., the United States, Israel, and Korea).&#13;
Other non-economic considerations includ.; .-tional prestige or identity.&#13;
1/   In late 1979 Brazil reportedly had export orders for ships totalling some&#13;
US$750 million (The Journal of Commerce, October 19, 1979). The Brazilian&#13;
shipbuilding industry reportedly employed some 43,000 persons directly&#13;
and another 150,000 persons indirectly. (Fairplay International Shipping&#13;
Weekly, August 16, 1979, p. 63).&#13;

D.   Regional, Sub-Regional and Other Trade and Shipping Between LDCs 1/&#13;
(i) Introduction&#13;
3.57      Economic cooperation between developing countries (ECDC) has been&#13;
the subject of much attention in recent years. It has, for instance, been a&#13;
theme of many international conferences and many reports. An UNCTAD Committee&#13;
on ECDC has been established. At an April 1980 inter-regional meeting of&#13;
experts, the LDCs agreed to start negotiations among themselves to establish&#13;
the Global System of Trade Preference as a major instrument for promoting&#13;
mutual trade, identifying, establishing, and promoting joint industrial&#13;
ventures for increasing production and employment, as well as cooperation in&#13;
improving transport and shipping. Although the role of ECDC in all its aspects&#13;
is clearly outside the scope of this paper, trade between LDCs is one major&#13;
aspect and is closely related to shipping because the bulk of this trade is,&#13;
and probably will continue to be, seaborne. There are several in5tances of&#13;
shipping cooperation between particular LDCs in order to promote such trade.&#13;
3.58      Full discussion of trade and shipping between LDCs would require&#13;
comprehensive data on past, present and likely future tonnage of such trade&#13;
in the form of trade matrices for major types of commodities as well as&#13;
data on the type, operating patterns, and costs of the shipping services&#13;
engaged in these trades. Since these data are not readily available, this&#13;
section refers briefly to past and present trade between LDCs in terms of&#13;
values and quantum indices. This is followed by a brief discussion of the&#13;
relationship between such trade and shipping and some examples of regional or&#13;
sub-regional cooperation between LDCs in shipping.&#13;
(ii) Trade between LDCs 2/&#13;
3.59      Although still accounting for a relatively small portion of total&#13;
world trade, trade between LDCs has been increasing rapidly in recent years.&#13;
As indicated in para. 1.14, it increased from US$11,000 million or 3.5% of&#13;
world trade in value terms in 1970 to US$99,000 million or 6.1% in 1978&#13;
(Table 35). Trade between LDCs accounted for about 25% of their exports and&#13;
38% of imports in 1979. In terms of volume, this trade is likely to account&#13;
for a larger share of world trade than in terms of value; according to one&#13;
estimate, seaborne trade between LDCs accounted for about 8% of the world&#13;
seabov.e trade volume in 1975 3/.&#13;
1/   The reference to LDCs in this section, particularly the references to&#13;
trade statistics, includes the capital surplus oil exporting countries.&#13;
2/   The statistics in this section are mainly taken from the United Nations,&#13;
Monthly Bulletin of Statistics, June 1979 and Statistical Yearbook 1978.&#13;
More information on this subject can also be found in Trade Among&#13;
Developing Countries by Main STC Groups and by Regions (TD/B/C.7/21),&#13;
statistical note by the UNCTAD Secretariat, September 20, 1978 and&#13;
Donald B. Keesing, Trade in Manufactures Among Developing Countries,&#13;
December 14, 1978.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
3.60      Slightly more than half of the intra-LDC trade was between countries&#13;
in the same geographical region, particularly in South and East Asia and in&#13;
the Americas. The share of regional trade had, however, declined somewhat&#13;
from the high of 70% in 1970. This was largely due to the increased impor-&#13;
tance of petroleum which is -mainly an inter-regional LDC trade; petroleum&#13;
accounted for 52% of the value of intra-LDC trade in 1977 as compared with&#13;
35% in 1970.&#13;
3.61      In terms of 1970 prices, trade between LDCs increased by 75% between&#13;
1970 and 1977; this was faster than the real growth of trade between developed&#13;
areas (48%) and also faster than the real growth in exports from LDCs to&#13;
developed countries (32%). The in.tra-LDC trade in manufactured products grew&#13;
much faster (161%) and that of petroleum (28%) much slower than the trade as&#13;
a whole (Table 36). The trade in manufactured products is largely intra-&#13;
regional in South and East Asia and the Americas although there is also an&#13;
increasing export trade from South and East Asia to the Middle East and&#13;
Africa (Table 37). As pointed out by Keesing (op. cit.) most of this trade&#13;
is from the relatively more to the relatively less industrialized LDCs.&#13;
(iii) Trade and Shipping between LDCs&#13;
3.62      Although detailed data are not available on the volume of trade&#13;
between LDCs, it is clear that this is predominantly by sea. According to&#13;
one estimate, intra-LDC trade (including that of capital surplus oil exporting&#13;
countries) totaled some 233 million tons in 1975 or just under 8% of the&#13;
total volume of world seaborne trade in that year. On the basis of the major&#13;
commodities involved in this trade in 1975, and on the type of shipping&#13;
services most likely to be used, it has been estimated that some 200 million&#13;
tons (86%) probably moved by tankers or combined carriers some 15 million&#13;
tons (6%) by bulk carriers, and some 18 million tons (8%) by liners 1/.&#13;
3.63      Without fairly detailed data on the present and potential future&#13;
intra-LDC trade, by country and by broad types of commodities, and a detailed&#13;
survey of existing shipping services between LDCs, it is not possible to&#13;
say to what extent constraints or lack of shipping and/or high transport&#13;
costs are obstacles to such trade. The situation is, however, likely to be&#13;
somewhat different for tanker and dry bulk goods where there is a interna-&#13;
tional chartering market and liner trades which tend to be served by partic-&#13;
ular vessels.&#13;
3.64      The relationship between trade and liner or small tramp shipping&#13;
services is somewhat circular. New shipping services are unlikely to develop&#13;
unless there is a sufficient trade or trade potential to make the service&#13;
profitable, but trade may not develop without reasonable shipping services.&#13;
As the trade of LDCs has traditionally been concentrated on developed&#13;
countries, more extensive services are usually available on these trade&#13;
routes. In some cases, trade between developing countries is transshipped&#13;
via developed countries. In other cases, the trade between developing&#13;
countries is carried as only part of a service linking a developing region&#13;
1/   Sapir and Lutz, op. cit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
with a developed region. In some of these and other trades, limited cargo&#13;
volumes mean that advantage cannot be taken of the economy of scale from&#13;
larger vessels or the high capacity utilization achieved which could reduce&#13;
relatively high freight rates 1/.&#13;
3.65      There are, however, many examples of trade between developing&#13;
countries and regions and shipping services having been developed. An&#13;
outstanding example of this is the establishment of a direct shipping service&#13;
between Brazil and Nigeria by the two countries- shipping companies. This&#13;
has almost certainly contributed to the rise in exports from Brazil to Nigeria&#13;
from US$12 million in 1974 to US$234 million in 1978. These comprise mostly&#13;
manufactured products, including vehicles 2/. The largest Brazilian liner&#13;
company also links Brazil with several other developing countries. Another&#13;
example of liner services between developing countries is the case of India,&#13;
where national flag vessels presently provide regular services to East&#13;
Africa, West Africa, the Red Sea as well as South Asia and East Asia. Between&#13;
1970/71 and 1977/78 India's exports to these destinations increased by about&#13;
250% while, for instance, exports to Latin America, where there is no direct&#13;
Indian national flag service, increased by only some 45% 3/. In most of&#13;
the export liner trades from India to the developing countries, Indian&#13;
lines carried in excess of 70% of the trade in 1976, the last year for which&#13;
the data are available.&#13;
3.66      As mentioned earlier about half of the intra-LDC trade is trade&#13;
within a region. Excluding fuels, approximately two-thirds of the 1977 value&#13;
of intra-LDC trade was between countries in the same region. This may be due&#13;
to many factors, including the establishment of a number of regional or&#13;
sub-regional trade arrangements, such as the Association of South East&#13;
Asian Nations 4/, closer economic or political relationships, lower transport&#13;
costs, the existence of local shipping services, etc.&#13;
1/   According to an UNCTAD report, "there is strong evidence that the&#13;
ad valorem incidence of transport costs on trade among developing&#13;
countries is higher than on trade with the developed world." (Trade&#13;
among Developing Countries by Main SITC Groups and by Regions, op.cit.&#13;
p. 11). However, no data are presented in the report to back up this&#13;
statement.&#13;

3.67      The high proportion of intra-regional LDC trade in South and South&#13;
East Asia and the Americas is accompanied by extensive liner and tramp ship-&#13;
ping services in these regions. This can partly be seen from Table 38 which&#13;
shows the number of liner and tramp vessels which were employed in major&#13;
intra-LDC trade routes in 1973, the last year for which such data are pres-&#13;
ently available although a similar survey for 1979 is under preparation. The&#13;
Table shows particularly large numbers of liner and tramp vessels in the&#13;
intra-South America, South East Asian, South Asian and African trades as well&#13;
as between Indonesia and the Philippines and India/Pakistan to South East&#13;
Asia. In this connection, it may be mentioned that a study of shipping to&#13;
and from Bangkok in 1966 and 1967 indicated that the shorter trade routes&#13;
tended to be much more competitive and have little effective conference&#13;
organzation while conference control seemed to be more rigorous for the&#13;
distant ports. This gave rise to relatively low freight rates and frequent&#13;
service on the short competitive routes 1/.&#13;
3.68      In some regions with modest intra-LDC trade, the trade may be&#13;
carried by liner vessels as part of their service to developed countries.&#13;
This appears, for instance, to be the case in West Africa, where some liner&#13;
trade between West African countries may be carried as part of the West&#13;
Africa-Europe services.&#13;
3.69      Another interesting aspect of Table 38 is the relatively high&#13;
proportion of older vessels on some of the intra-regional LDC trades or the&#13;
relatively short distance inter-regional trades. For instance, in the intra-&#13;
South American trades more than half the vessels were over 20 years old.&#13;
Similarly, in the intra-South East Asia trades almost half the vessels were&#13;
over 20 years old in 1973. This may indicate a gradual need for rehabilita-&#13;
tion or modernization in some of the intra-LDC trades, but it may also reflect&#13;
the economical use of relatively older and more labor intensive vessels on&#13;
short distance intra-LDC trades.&#13;
3.70      Similar information is not available concerning bulk shipping&#13;
between LDCs. However, the UNCTAD secretariat has identified a number of&#13;
intra-LDC trades in the five major dry bulk commodities 2/, totalling some&#13;
7.3 million tons in 1976.  One important, sub-regional trade is the export&#13;
of some 1.3 million tons of wheat from Argentina to Brazil, Chile and Peru&#13;
and Argentina's imports of some 1.6 million tons of iron ore from the same&#13;
countries. The same report also indicates major petroleum (crude and products)&#13;
trade between LDCs. Other bulk commodities may also move in substantial quan-&#13;
tities; for instance, logs, rice and, to a lesser extent, locally produced&#13;
urea fertilizers, move in quantity between South East Asian countries.&#13;

annual shipments exceeding 100,000 tons. (Shipment of Bulk Charges&#13;

Secretariat November 23, 1979.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
3.71      While increased economic cooperation and trade between LDCs&#13;
will probably require further investments in shipping services, particularly&#13;
in liner and tramp services, it is essential to consider such plans on a&#13;
comprehensive case-by-case basis taking into account the trade route poten-&#13;
tial, txade organization, financing, insurance as well as transport, includ-&#13;
ing shipping. It cannot be assumed that the mere introduction of shipping&#13;
services, even if subsidized, will lead automatically to increased trade&#13;
unless there already was a sound potential for such trade 1/.&#13;
3.72      Apart from the availability of liner or tramp shipping services,&#13;
the level and structure of freiaht rates could be an impediment in some&#13;
instances to increased LDC exports and increased intra-LDC trade in&#13;
manufactured exports. However, sufficient information is not available to&#13;
draw a firm conclusion on this point. It has generally been recognized&#13;
that a major determinant of liner freight rate structures has been the unit&#13;
value of cargoes; that is that higher value goods were likely to have higher&#13;
absolute freight rates. This tendency may be more marked in the case of&#13;
trades dominated by strong conferences than in competitive trades 21.   It&#13;
is less clear whether freight rates as a percent of the cargo value increase&#13;
or decrease with the degree of processing 3/.&#13;
3.73      Increased cooperation and trade between LDCs in the future may&#13;
also give rise to bulk or specialized shipping services on a project basis,&#13;
e.g., in the case of fertilizers.&#13;
3.74      It may be noted that several of the DFC sub-loans for shipping in&#13;
recent years have been for bulk or tramp vessels which would operate on a&#13;
bilateral or sub-regional basis in South East Asia, e.g., between Indonesia&#13;
and Korea or Indonesia and the Philippines.&#13;
1/   An example of this was the establishment of the West Indies Shipping&#13;
Corporation (WISCO) in 1961 by the West Indies Federation. The&#13;
objectives of this company were to (i) encourage regional trade,&#13;
(ii) bring down the cost of living, and (iii) influence the rates&#13;
charged by the ocean shipping lines. For this purpose the governments&#13;
agreed to subsidize the line. However, according to a Bank Economic&#13;
Report, the policy failed on all three accounts. For instance, it&#13;
did not substantially influence the volume of intra-regional trade,&#13;
"because transport costs--representing only 5% of delivered prices-were&#13;
the least of the various impediments to trade. (The Commonwealth&#13;
Caribbean the Integration Experience, published for the World Bank by&#13;
the Johns Hopkins University Press, 1978, p. 107). In fact, WISCO was&#13;
restructured in 1975 and put on a more commercially viable basis (ibid).&#13;
2/   In fact, and as would be expected, Bennathan and Walters (op.cit.)&#13;
found that on competitive routes to and from Thailand, the unit value&#13;
had no role in determining the freight rate.&#13;

Increase with Fabrication?" Oxford Economic Papers, July 1977 pp. 45-71.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
(iv)   Regional or Sub-regional Cooperation betewen LDCs in Shipping&#13;
3.75      In recent years there has been a trend towards sub-regional or&#13;
regional cooperation in shipping.  One way of enabling LDCs to participate&#13;
in the carriage of their foreign trade could be to encourage this trend and&#13;
to ensure that the services are operated on an efficient, cost-competitive&#13;
basis. Examples of international joint ventures involving two or more&#13;
developing countries include two liner companies in the Caribbean-WISCO&#13;
which includes Trinidad and Tobago, Antigua, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada,&#13;
Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Kitts, St. Lucia and St Vincent, and NAMUCAR&#13;
which includes Costa Rica, Cuba, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Trinidad and&#13;
Tobago and Venez-udLL)-. Other examples include one major oil shipping company&#13;
(AMPTC) in the Middle East which includes Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq,&#13;
Kuwait, Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates; and one major&#13;
liner company (UASC) in the same region involving Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait,&#13;
Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and one liner company in the&#13;
Pacific (Pacific Forum Line). There are also a significant number of bila-&#13;
teral shipping companies involving either government or private interests in&#13;
two developing countries (for instance, Irano-Hind Company Ltd. between the&#13;
Shipping Corporation of India Ltd. and Arya National Shipping Line of Iran;&#13;
the Syro-Jordanian Shipping Co., involving the two governments; the Jamaica&#13;
Merchant Marines Ltd. involving Jamaica and Mexico; and Flota Mercante&#13;
Grancolombiana between Colombia and Ecuador). Apart from joint ventures&#13;
between developing countries, there has also been, in recent years, a large&#13;
number of joint ventures between established shipping or trading companies in&#13;
developed market economy countries and government or private interests in&#13;
individual LDCs, particularly in the Middle East. The status of most of&#13;
these joint ventures, however, is not known. Arab Shipping 1979, a Seatrade&#13;
Guide, published by Seatrade Publications, 1979, contains a tentative list of&#13;
reported joint ventures in the Middle East. In many cases these were new&#13;
companies with direct government ownership while in others they involve one&#13;
or more pre-existina shipping lines as in the case of Irano-Hind Shipping&#13;
Company and UASC. Information is not available to evaluate the economic and&#13;
financial success of these ventures, but it is understood that a number of&#13;
the sub-regional, multi-national shipping companies have in recent years been&#13;
losing money 1/, It is not known to what extent losses are due to initial&#13;
starting up difficulties, the gestation period it takes for trade to build&#13;
up, given particular market conditions, or to poor management planning,&#13;
operations or uncommercial policies.&#13;
1/   This reportedly has been the case of two multinational companies in the&#13;
Middle East (AMPTC and UASC), and two in the Caribbean (WISCO and&#13;
NAMUCAR). On the other hand the Irano-Hind Shipping Company apparently&#13;
was profitable prior to the recent political events. It is also reported&#13;
that WISCO's financial situation is improving after a many years of&#13;
losses (Seatrade, February 1980, pp. 113-139 reviews the shipping situa-&#13;
tion in the Caribbean).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
3.76      In some cases regional or sub-regional cooperation in shipping is&#13;
taking place on a broader basis. In the case of the ASEAN countries, for&#13;
example, there has been a move towards sub-regional negotiations with partic-&#13;
ular shipping conferences and the formation of a sub-regional shipowners asso-&#13;
ciation. Similarly, the trend towards regional cooperation is also seen in the&#13;
Pacific from the establishment of a regional shipping line (The Pacific Forum&#13;
Line). Finally, in West Africa, there is a strong move towards regional coop-&#13;
eration in a number of aspects of shipping, that range from overall shipping&#13;
policy, through negotiations with shipping conferences, regional shippers'&#13;
council, regional institutions for maritime training to a regional shipowners&#13;
association. There is also tal'k about one or more regional shipbuilding.and&#13;
ship-repair facilities 1/. This trend towards sub-regional cooperation in&#13;
West Africa appears to be coordinated by the Ministerial Conference of&#13;
Central and West African States with a permanent secretariat in Abidjan and&#13;
is complemented by a move towards freer regional trade within ECOWAS. The&#13;
Ministerial Conference, for instance, reportedly has decided that for the&#13;
purposes of the Convention on a Code of Conduct, West Africa should be&#13;
treated as a single maritime range 2/.&#13;
3.77      The trend towards increased intra-LDC trade and economic cooperation&#13;
is likely to continue, and may be facilitated through the encouragement of&#13;
appropriate and competitive shipping services.&#13;
E.   Shipping in Economic Development of LDCs&#13;
(i) Introduction&#13;
3.78      This section, which draws extensively on the discussion and&#13;
data presented in Sections B and C of this chapter, will first review the&#13;
main potentially positive and negative development aspects of shipping&#13;
investments by LDCs and, secondly, identify the types of LDCs which may be&#13;
more likely to benefit from sound investments in ocean-going shipping. Due&#13;
to the very large differences which exist, the section can only develop&#13;
some broad guidelines. Individual LDCs considering the purchase of ships&#13;
should weigh the priority of such investments with alternative investments&#13;
in other domestic or export-oriented industries. As discussed earlier, an&#13;
investment in shipping by a particular LDC should not be looked upon in&#13;
isolation but as a part of a maritime strategy or policy that is linked&#13;
closely with the general foreign trade and economic development strategy of&#13;
the country. Due to the uncertainty concerning the benefits from shipping,&#13;
it is essential that any investment in the sector be preceded by appropriate&#13;
feasibility studies.&#13;
1/   A large number of regional or sub-regional technical assistance projects&#13;
in the maritime sector in both West and East Africa were included in the&#13;
Program of Action of the United Nations Transport and Communications&#13;
Decade for Africa 1978-1988 (Document E/CN.14/726/add.1, Volume II,&#13;
Part III.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
(ii) 1?otential Positive Factors in Shipping Investments by&#13;
Particular LDCs&#13;
3.79      The main potential benefits from investments in shipping, as dis-&#13;
cussed earlier, are the following:&#13;
(i) net foreign exchange savings;&#13;
(ii) assistance to the country's foreign trade and general&#13;
economy through lower freight rates and/or new, better&#13;
or more secure shipping service, and/or better export&#13;
returns on essential bulk commodities;&#13;
(iii)  linkages with the rest of the economy which lead to&#13;
greater economic diversification and development; and&#13;
(iv) net profits from the shipping operations.&#13;
These are summarized briefly in the following paragraphs.   It should, however,&#13;
be recalled from the earlier discussion on these points that the benefits are&#13;
by no means certain and, in particular circumstances, they could be negative.&#13;
3.80      The earlier discussion (Section C(ii) of this chapter) has indicated&#13;
that sound investments in shipping are likely to result in some net savings of&#13;
foreign exchange. The relative savings will be greatest where, at least after&#13;
an initial build-up period, the country can utilize domestic rather than&#13;
foreign shipping resources, e.g., crews, management and overhead, insurance,&#13;
communications, vessel repairs, spare parts and supplies, and possibly even&#13;
the ships themselves. The net foreign exchange savings may be relatively&#13;
greater from the more labor-intensive types of vessels, and from the use of&#13;
second-hand vessels, but careful consideration should be given both to the&#13;
competitive efficiency of different vessel types and the possible availability&#13;
of new ships on special low financial terms.&#13;
3.81      Another potential benefit from sound shipping investments.is the&#13;
positive effect on the foreign trade balance. This can occur through reduced&#13;
freight rates on existing exports/imports or the traffic generated through&#13;
improved or more-suitable shipping services. Participation of an LDC shipping&#13;
line in a particular liner conference may have a favorable impact on freight&#13;
rates. This is not necessarily so, however, where a country invests in liner&#13;
vessels that cannot be operated profitably at the prevailing conference rates&#13;
or the effect of participation of the national flag vessels is to strengthen&#13;
the conference's control over the trade. Consideration should also be given,&#13;
on a case-by-case basis, to assess whether similar trade promotion effects&#13;
could be achieved through the establishment of locally owned and financed&#13;
freight forwarding industry or through the strengthening of shippers' organi-&#13;
zations and consultations between shippers and conferences in liner trades.&#13;
3.82      Trade promotion prospects are possible from sound investments in&#13;
liner, small tramp or specialized bulk vessels, especially to provide new or&#13;
expanded services between developing countries, provided they are not under-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
taken in isolation but integrated with a comprehensive, coordinated program&#13;
of trade expansion, or as a part of specific export-oriented projects related&#13;
to fertilizer production, coal mining, etc. Further potential for trade&#13;
promotion exists when the current vessels and shipping technologies do not&#13;
provide the most economic total transport chain and coordinated improvements&#13;
in vessels, ports and inland transport are required to achieve a least-cost&#13;
transport system.&#13;
3.83      The potential for profitable shipping operation is a major consider-&#13;
ation. The earlier discusssion of profitability-in shipping (Section B (ii)&#13;
of this chapter) indicated that some public sector LDC shipping companies&#13;
appear to have been profitable. The rapid expansion of some private sector&#13;
LDC shipping companies in recent years suggests a similar experience. Never-&#13;
theless, there is evidence that a number of LDC shipping companies either&#13;
have been losing money or earning only marginal returns.&#13;
3.84      Economic benefits from national investments in shipping, and the&#13;
potential broader development effects of such investments, are likely&#13;
to depend significantly on the extent to which shipping is integrated with,&#13;
and contributes to, the economic development of the country. Such was the&#13;
case in Korea. Backward linkages (as discussed in Section C (v) of this&#13;
chapter) will depend on the resource allocation of the country and the extent&#13;
the national fleet draws on the service industries such as ship-repair&#13;
yards, marine insurance, ship finance organization, ship classification&#13;
services, marine telecommunication services, marine training institutes,&#13;
marine research institutes, etc.&#13;
3.85      Finally, to those countries dependent on regular supplies of essen-&#13;
tial raw materials and with a difficult geopolitical situation, the question&#13;
of security of service is an important consideration.&#13;
(iii) Potential Negative Factors in Shipping Investments by Particular LDCs&#13;
3.86      There are a number of factors which may adversely affect the poten-&#13;
tial benefits to LDCs from shipping investments.   These include:&#13;
(i) the increasingly capital-intensive nature of many types&#13;
of shipping;&#13;
(ii) the riskiness of some sections of the industry;&#13;
(iii) the existence in some cases of alternatives to&#13;
transport by owned vessels;&#13;
(iv) the fact that some developed countries directly or&#13;
indirectly subsidize their shipping industries;&#13;
(v) competition from the increasing involvement of some&#13;
CPE and tramp shipping lines in liner routes on a&#13;
non-conference, lower-than-conference-freight-rate-&#13;
basis; and&#13;
(vi) protectionism.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
These factors are discussed below.&#13;
3.87      Shipping, as already discussed, is generally a capital-intensive&#13;
industry with modest direct employment creation effects. This is partic-&#13;
ularly true for modern vessels such as container ships, LNG, LPG, and&#13;
large bulk carriers. Capital needs, however, may be reduced by focusing&#13;
on the relatively less capital-intensive sectors, by using second-hand&#13;
vessels and, even more, by using leased or chartered vessels to some extent.&#13;
From a countryWs point of view, a joint venture with an established shipping&#13;
line could also be a way of reducing the investment needs as well as acquiring&#13;
operational experience and market contacts.&#13;
3.88      Shipping is generally considered a risky business.   This, however,&#13;
varies significantly with the types of shipping and operating pattern. It&#13;
is relatively small in bulk shipping as part of an integrated project or&#13;
under long-term charter arrangements; liner shipping in a country s foreign&#13;
trade is also relatively less risky than cross-trading in liner trades or in&#13;
bulk trades.&#13;
3.89      In many cases there may be alternatives related to shipping which&#13;
do not involve heavy investments. For general cargo, this includes development&#13;
of a domestic forwarding industry to achieve lower transport costs through&#13;
international door-to-door freight control over cargo movements between&#13;
inland points. It also involves strengthened shippers organizations as a&#13;
means of balancing the powers of shipping conferences and providing a medium&#13;
for commercial consultations with them as discussed in Chapter II. In the&#13;
bulk trades, long-term chartering of vessels by shippers or the operation of&#13;
chartered or leased vessels by a national shipping line may be alternatives to&#13;
actual investment in vessels. Whether this would be more or less advantageous&#13;
to a particular country would have to be evaluated on a case-by-ca^b basis.&#13;
An important factor in anv comparison is the timing, as long-term chartering&#13;
near a market peak could be very costly.&#13;
3.90      The potential comparative advantage which some LDCs have in shipping&#13;
may be offset by open registry shipping using crews from other LDCs or low-&#13;
wage developed countries. However, this could change as a result of continu-&#13;
ing ITF efforts to raise wage levels on open registry vessels as well as the&#13;
present efforts of many LDCs and UNCTAD to phase out open registries. The&#13;
practice by some developed countries of assisting their own shipping industries&#13;
through various direct or indirect subsidies or other measures may also&#13;
negatively affect the potential benefits from sound shipping investments by&#13;
individual LDCs.&#13;
3.91      The increasing involvement of several NIE shipping lines in liner&#13;
shipping, frequently operating outside the conferences and offering lower&#13;
freight rates, may also negatively affect the potential benefits to some&#13;
LDCs from investments in shipping, but favor trading by lower freight rates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
3.92      A more difficult factor to assess is the potential trend towards&#13;
cargo sharing and protectionism as reflected in the Convention on a Code of&#13;
Conduct for Liner Conferences and the proposals for "equitable participation"&#13;
by LDCs in bulk shipping. These proposals could assist some LDCs to develop&#13;
their shipping industries and might avoid more serious unilateral or bi-&#13;
lateral regulation. However) they could also encourage uneconomic invest-&#13;
ments, restrict the growth of the fleets of those LDCs that have been more&#13;
successful and competitive, cause less efficient use of shipping capacity&#13;
and, therefore, tend to increase freight rates.&#13;
3.93      The above factors which may adversely affect shipping investments&#13;
obviuu-sly do not mean that all LDCs should refrain from such investments.&#13;
Rather, they suggest the need for careful inter-sectoral analysis, deter-&#13;
mination of priorities and the undertaking of feasibility studies before&#13;
actual investments are made.&#13;
(iv) Shipping Investments by Types of LDCs and Circumstances&#13;
3.94      The potential benefits and costs from investments in ocean-going&#13;
shipping need to be considered on a case-by-case basis due to the large&#13;
number of variables involved. It may, however, be useful on the basis of&#13;
the earlier discussion to try t,o identify types of LDCs and the circumstances&#13;
wherein investments in ocean-going shipping are more likely to be beneficial.&#13;
These are summarized below:&#13;
(i) the country has an environment that seems to offer comparative&#13;
advantages in the sector such as a maritime or naval background&#13;
and resources such as trained or partly-trained personnel&#13;
(officers and ratings as well as management); an appropriate&#13;
institutional framework (both from the national and company&#13;
point of view), and a potential for significant economic&#13;
linkages to make possible efficient and economical operation&#13;
of national flag vessels in its foreign trade, possibly&#13;
discounting an initial "learning" period. It is assumed&#13;
that the vessel technology adopted would take into account&#13;
the trade characteristics, as well as the relative resource&#13;
costs to the country, both for shipping and related services;&#13;
(ii) the country has a potential for substantial net foreign&#13;
exchange savings from shipping because of the size and&#13;
nature of its trade and resource situations. This may be&#13;
particularly important for countries where freight payments&#13;
to foreign lines represent a significant drain on the&#13;
country's foreign exchange;&#13;
(iii)  the country has sufficient capital resources to permit invest-&#13;
ments in a relatively capital-intensive industry or, alter-&#13;
natively, that capital for vessel acquisition can be obtained&#13;
from abroad on reasonable terms, either in the form of joint&#13;
ventures or loans;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
(iv)  the country has a good potential for new or increased foreign&#13;
trade with specific other countries that is presently being&#13;
inhibited by the cost and service limitations of its shipping&#13;
services. This is less likely to be the case for standard&#13;
bulk commodities or liner services to major established&#13;
trading partners. It is more likely to be the case for&#13;
potential new trades in manufactured products between two&#13;
or more developing countries and then particularly from the&#13;
more industrialized to the less industrialized LDCs as dis-&#13;
cussed in Chapter III (D);&#13;
(v) seaborne foreign trade is important for the economy and&#13;
sufficient in volume and composition to justify appropriate&#13;
vessels and where the existing organization of trade gives,&#13;
or can be modified to give, national shippers a voice in the&#13;
shipping arrangements;&#13;
(vi) the country is an important exporter or importer of bulk&#13;
commodities, but the trade partner controls the shipments&#13;
of the bulk commodities and the freight costs used in deriving&#13;
their f.o.b. export values or c.i.f. import values are higher&#13;
than those available on the open market or under national flag&#13;
operations;&#13;
(vii) regular and reliable shipping services are important for the&#13;
import of essential raw materials and/or the export of important&#13;
commodities;&#13;
(viii)  the vessels and shipping technologies currently being used in&#13;
major trades are not the most economical from a total transport&#13;
and distribution chain point of view;&#13;
(ix) the country is developing a major project which will give rise&#13;
to significant exports or imports where tailor-made shipping&#13;
services may be the most economical solution.&#13;
A further condition could be where the existing conference liner services are&#13;
not operated efficiently and result in higher-than-necessary freight rates.&#13;
However, identifying such cases would involve extremely complex issues and&#13;
would also require careful consideration of whether the shortcomings could&#13;
be overcome through shippers' councils and similar institutions as well as the&#13;
encouragement of non-conference competition.&#13;
3.95      The LDC countries meeting several of the above criteria are more&#13;
likely to be the larger, more industrialized countries with important existing&#13;
seaborne trade volumes and some maritime background (e.g., from coastal or&#13;
inter-island shipping or the provision of crews to open registry fleets as in&#13;
the case of the Philippines). It is, however, possible that some smaller&#13;
countries could take advantage of special cilcumstances and develop modest&#13;
shipping fleets for cross-trading as done by the Maldives Islands. It is&#13;
also possible for relatively small and less-industrialized countries in a&#13;
region to form a multinational shipping comp'any or joint shipping operation as&#13;
in the case of WISCO in the Caribbean.&#13;

IV. VESSEL ACQUISITION - SOURCES OF SHIP FINANCE AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE&#13;
A.   Introduction&#13;
4.01      In principle, several different sources of ship finance and technical&#13;
assistance may be considered. However, not all of the sources may be avail-&#13;
able or appropriate in a particular case.&#13;
4.02      The main sources of ship finances are:&#13;
(a) Equity investment by the public and/or private sector&#13;
in LDCs, including in some cases partial foreign&#13;
investment by foreign joint venture partners;&#13;
(b) National shipping finance funds or local development&#13;
finance companies;&#13;
(c) Export credits by foreign yards;&#13;
(d) Bilateral asssistance;&#13;
(e) Commercial banks and ship mortgage lenders;&#13;
(f) Leasing; and&#13;
(g) International financial or development institutions (IFIs).&#13;
These are discussed briefly in the following paragraphs. It should, however,&#13;
be emphasized that no comprehensive information system presently exists for&#13;
the collection and compilation of ship financing data. However, according&#13;
to one estimate 1/ the amount spent on ship acquisition during 1970-1978 was&#13;
about US$120 billion or about US$13 billion p.a. and expenditures for ship&#13;
acquisition during the early 1980s were unlikely to fall below US$15 billion&#13;
p.a. No separate figures were given for LDCs.&#13;
B.   Sources of Finance&#13;
(i) Equity Investment&#13;
4.03      Self-financing through the use of prior earnings or depreciation&#13;
reserves has traditionally been an important source of ship finance for&#13;
established shipping companies. This may also be the case for well estab-&#13;
lished shipping companies in developing countries but they may face particular&#13;

Paper presented at the 1979 Baltic and International Maritime Conference&#13;
in Cannes, May 29 - June 1, 1979. It excludes the fleets of centrally&#13;
planned economies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-56 -&#13;
problems in using such resources for acquisition of vessels abroad due to&#13;
currency restrictions. In some joint ventures between parties in developing&#13;
countries and established shipping interests in developed countries, the&#13;
equity participation of the established company may in part be in the form&#13;
of foreign currency or ships. In addition they may contribute important&#13;
operational experience.&#13;
(ii) National Shipping Finance Funds or Development Finance Corporations&#13;
4.04      Some developing countries have created special funds for the&#13;
establishment or expansion of their merchant marines, or included ship&#13;
finance under public development finance corporations. Special shipping&#13;
funds or government shipping loans for ship acquisition are available in&#13;
Argentina, Brazil, India, Korea, Kuwait, Pakistan and Peru. These may,&#13;
however, depending on Government policy and the foreign exchange situation,&#13;
apply only to ships built at national yards. As mentioned earlier, special&#13;
shipping credit units have been established in Indonesia and the Philippines.&#13;
(iii) Export Credits&#13;
4.05      Export credits, probably the most widely used method of financing&#13;
new buildings for developing countries, basically consist of suppliers'&#13;
credits financed by the banking system with Government backing in the form&#13;
of export credit insurance. In 1969, the Governments of the OECD countries&#13;
signed an "Understanding on Export Credit for Ships" by which they agreed&#13;
to harmonize official ship loan terms. The current understanding provides for&#13;
a minimum downpayment of 20%, 8-1/2 years maximum loan duration and minimum&#13;
interest rate to 8%. Clause 6 of the "Understanding" provides that&#13;
"any Government participating in the Understanding which&#13;
wishes, for genuine aid reasons, to concede more favorable&#13;
terms in a particular case is not precluded from doing so;&#13;
provided that adequate notice of this decision is given to&#13;
all the parties of the Understanding in accordance with the&#13;
procedures established for this purpose" 1/.&#13;
(iv) Bilateral Assistance&#13;
4.06      Comprehensive information on bilateral assistance for ship finance&#13;
is not available but such assistance appears to have gained more prominence&#13;
during the last few years. This may be due to an increased effort by develop-&#13;
ing countries to obtain bilateral assistance for their merchant marine develop-&#13;
ment plans or the realization by some shipbuilding countries that orders from&#13;
developing countries are one way of partly alleviating the existing surplus&#13;
capacity. Bilateral assistance is thus more likely to be available for the&#13;
acquisition of new ships from the donor country and less likely for purchase&#13;
in other countries or for rehabilitation of existing fleets or acquisition of&#13;
second-hand vessels. In some cases very favorable financing terms may result.&#13;
It has, for instance, been reported that Pakistan obtained a 30-year loan at&#13;
3% with a 10-year moratorium 2/.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
(v)   Commercial Banks and Ship Mortgage Lenders&#13;
4.07      Financing of new or second-hand vessels can also be arranged through&#13;
commercial banks or ship mortgage lenders, sources which were particularly&#13;
active in ship finance during 1972-1973, although how much of this was for&#13;
developing countries is not known. Such financing is normal for a maximum of&#13;
50-60% of vessel cost or market value. The existence of adequate national&#13;
maritime laws to provide the proper legal basis for ship mortgage and other&#13;
loan guarantees is a common requirement in this type of financing.&#13;
(vi) Leasing&#13;
4.08      In contrast to regular acquisition, lease financing allows the&#13;
lessee the economic use of the ship while the lessor retains title to it. The&#13;
lessor can be a ship yard, finance company, bank or special leasing company.&#13;
Leasing can avoid heavy capital investment for ship acquisition, particularly&#13;
if the agreement provides for a later purcbase option, but the attractiveness&#13;
of such financing may depend on the particular tax regulation in the country&#13;
of the lessee and the lessor. Korea is known to have used a hire-purchase&#13;
system with the ship becoming Korean at the end of the charter. A particular&#13;
aspect requiring consideration is the extent to which a leased vessel can be&#13;
registered in the lessee's country or must be registered in that of the lessor.&#13;
(vii) International Development Institutions&#13;
4.09      Past direct or indirect lending by the Bank for ship acquisition&#13;
has been discussed earlier in this paper. As far as it is known, lending by&#13;
regional development institutions such as the Asian Development Bank, the&#13;
African Development Bank, the Caribbean Development Bank has not been signi-&#13;
ficant; the Caribbean Development Bank has lent to the regional shipping line&#13;
WISCO.&#13;
C.   Finance and Technical Assistance&#13;
4.10      In recent years many international, bilateral, and commercial&#13;
organizations have assisted LDCs to establish or expand their merchant&#13;
fleets. Foreign finance for ship acquisition appears to have been mostly&#13;
through export credits by foreign yards and commercial banks or ship mortgage&#13;
lenders, although bilateral assistance may also have been particularly&#13;
significant in the last few years but specific data are not readily available.&#13;
Lending by the international development banks, mainly the World Bank, appears&#13;
to have been modest. Much of the financing through export credits or bilateral&#13;
assistance has been tied to procurement from particular yards in particular&#13;
countries. How far this tying of finance has resulted in a compromise between&#13;
financing terms and ship price or design flexibility is uncertain. That&#13;
finance is more readily available for new rather than for second-hand vessels&#13;
may be a temptation for some LDCs to invest in the former. Some LDCs wishing&#13;
to expand or renew their fleets through the acquisition of a significant&#13;
number of new vessels have explored possible package deals, sometimes on a&#13;
government-to-government basis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
4.11      Several international organizations and some bilateral agencies have&#13;
provided various forms of maritime technical assistance in recent years. In&#13;
addition, some LDCs have contracted directly for the assistance of shipping&#13;
management firms, consulting firms or individual experts. Maritime technical&#13;
assistance covers many different aspects such as training courses or&#13;
establishment of national or regional maritime training institutes (for both&#13;
crew and ship management), on-the-job training with shipping companies or&#13;
shipping authorities in other countries, feasibility studies, shipping opera-&#13;
tional assistance and assistance for the development of needed shipping&#13;
infrastructure and institutions (e.g., maritime legislation' ship classifica-&#13;
tion, marine insurance). International organizations such as ILO, IMCO, UNCTAD&#13;
and the United Nations regional commissions have provided shipping technical&#13;
assistance in the form of advice and training for LDCs. The World Bank's&#13;
assistance to particular LDCs for ocean-going shipping has been discussed in&#13;
Chapter 1B. Although detailed information is not available, several developed&#13;
countries have also arranged training courses for the shipping' industry of&#13;
developing countries and provided funds on a bilateral basis for feasibility&#13;
studies or other forms of technical assistance.&#13;
4.12      Four recent developments concerning maritime training and technical&#13;
assistance are worth mentioning. Firstly, the UNCTAD secretariat established&#13;
in 1979 a new SHIPASSIST service which will provide a global inventory of&#13;
technical assistance sources available to LDCs in the development of their&#13;
national merchant marines, ports, shipping services and maritime transport&#13;
technologies 1/. Secondly, a technical assistance project, "Training Develop-&#13;
ment in the Field of Maritime Transport," which is financed by UNDP and exe-&#13;
cuted by UNCTAD, aims at developing training methods and pilot courses, as&#13;
well as instructors, for the maritime sector on a national or regional basis.&#13;
The four training courses to be developed under the project include shipping&#13;
operations and maritime legislation, as well as two port-related courses 2/.&#13;
Thirdly, IMCO is establishing a special fund for financing technical assist-&#13;
ance projects concerned with maritime training. This fund, which will be&#13;
based on voluntary contributions, would be for the provision of training,&#13;
demonstration or pilot equipment; expert services, fellowships; or support for&#13;
short-term seminars for personnel engaged in maritime training 3/. Fourthly,&#13;
the second ACP-EEC Convention of Lome includes a joint declaration (Annex XIX)&#13;
which paves the way for an examination of subjects of common interest in the&#13;
field of sea transport, with the Community declaring itself prepared to&#13;
help develop this sector in any ACP State that may so request (the development&#13;
of shipping companies--setting up joint ventures--technical assistance for&#13;
training and management, etc.) 4/.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
4.13      It would appear that, besides development banks such as the World&#13;
Bank and some bilateral agencies, most of the assistance to LDCs is available&#13;
only for finance for ship acquisition or for technical assistance, but not for&#13;
both. Joint ventures with an existing shipping company would in most cases&#13;
involve both finance and operational experience. There might, however, be a&#13;
need for an independent review of the joint venture proposals before public&#13;
funds were committed to particular joint ventures.&#13;
D.   General Considerations&#13;
4.14      LDCs have, on numerous occasions, sugge,sted that the lack of avail-&#13;
ability and high terms of financing pose important obstacles to 'their plans&#13;
to develop their shipping 1/. It would appear that this has not applied&#13;
equally to all LDCs. Some of the larger countries have given priority to&#13;
developing the sector and by allocating significant resources to it through&#13;
national financial institutions, have been able to build up substantial&#13;
fleets, as is illustrated by Brazil, India and Korea. Under present condi-&#13;
tions of excess shipbuilding capacity (although significantly less than&#13;
during 1975-1977), keen competition between yards, and government assistance&#13;
in several developed countries to their shipbuilding industry, the supply of&#13;
financing for acquisition of new ships would appear to be less of a problem&#13;
than in the past. However, the terms of their financing, including grace&#13;
and repayment periods, the suitability of a vessel's design and its costs&#13;
need to be carefully considered since these may significantly affect vessel&#13;
capital and operating costs as would the timing of the investment in re-&#13;
lation to market conditions and ship prices. As capital costs may account&#13;
for one-quarter to one half of the total vessel operating costs, differences&#13;
in price and/or financing terms may have a significant impact on the ope-&#13;
rating costs and, therefore, the prospects for competitive and profitable&#13;
operations. With regard to the acquisition of second-hand vessels or vessel&#13;
conversions, financing is less readily available or may only be available&#13;
on rather hard terms. In this connection an UNCTAD Group of Experts on&#13;
Improved Methods of Financing Ship Acquisition by Developing Countries&#13;
concluded in 1978, inter alia, that the lack of finance on suitable conditions&#13;
has been a factor which has restricted the establishment and/or growth of the&#13;
merchant marines of developing countries. Specific mention was made that the&#13;
prevailing commercial loan periods (seven years) were too short, based on ex-&#13;
pected vessel earnings 2/. It recommended, inter alia, consideration of using&#13;

121(V) of June 3, 1979, reproduced in Annex 7. Annex 8 includes the&#13;
operational parts of some earlier UNCTAD resolutions on this subject.&#13;

a 70% loan at 8%, the annual loan repayments would be about US$1.88&#13;
million if repaid in equal amounts over seven years as compared with&#13;
US$1.14 million per annum if repaid over 15 years. For comparison&#13;
it may be mentioned that based on mid-1979 charter rates such a vessel&#13;
might have received US$2.2 million per annum on a time charter basis.&#13;

bilateral and multilateral development aid for the acquisition of second-hand&#13;
ships 1/. It may be added that direct Bank loans have, in the past, been used&#13;
for the acquisition of second-hand vessels and for rehabilitation of existing&#13;
vessels (e.g. in Indonesia) as have indirect loans through DFCs.&#13;
4.15      The existing situation - surplus yard capacity, keen competition,&#13;
and government assistance to shipyards for attracting orders - may assist LDCs&#13;
in establishinig or expanding their national merchant marines. However, to&#13;
the extent that such investments are not preceded by careful feasibility&#13;
studies, including proper sensitivity analysis, to determine the economic jus-&#13;
tification and financial viability of the investment, and the suitability of&#13;
the particular type of vessel proposed, this could result in uneconomic&#13;
investments.  This appears already to have taken place.  With finance more&#13;
readily available for new ships and for certain types of new ships, there&#13;
is a weighty inducement to build new ships even when the acquisition of new&#13;
vessels of different types, or the acquisition of second-hand vessels or the&#13;
conversion of vessels might be more economical.&#13;

V. CONCLUSIONS&#13;
5.01      The previous chapters, while generally confirming the relatively&#13;
high capital intensity, low profitability and risky nature of ocean-going&#13;
shipping, have highlighted the wide-ranging differences both between and&#13;
within all sectors of the industry. Although based on very incomplete&#13;
information, it has been suggested that investment in shipping for some&#13;
developing countries has yielded benefits in terms of positive returns on&#13;
net fixed assets and in savings of foreign exchange. Additional benefits may&#13;
have been achieved through backward linkages and assistance to foreign trade&#13;
and the economy through increased security of service, improved service, the&#13;
opening up of new trade routes, and a positive impact on freight rates.&#13;
These desirable benefits, however, are not certain and could well be negative,&#13;
e.g., where inefficient operations of vessels leads to increases in freight&#13;
rates. While pointing out the increased potential for intra-LDC shipping,&#13;
both for general cargo and bulk or for specialized cargoes related to specific&#13;
projects, attention is also drawn to a number of potentially negative factors&#13;
for LDC shipping investments. These have to be considered on a case-by-case&#13;
basis, with a satisfactory determination of inter-sectoral priorities and&#13;
detailed feasibility studies being pre-conditions for any investment in the&#13;
sector.&#13;
5.02      The discussion has also indicated that while financing for new&#13;
vessels may be readily available from various sources, particularly export&#13;
credits or a combination of such credits and bilateral aid, careful attention&#13;
needs to be given by LDCs to the total package of financing terms, ship&#13;
prices and particular ship designs in light of traffic requirements. The&#13;
relatively easy availability of foreign financing for new vessels in recent&#13;
years may have induced some developing countries to invest in shipping&#13;
without proper prior assessment of the economic, financial, technical, employ-&#13;
ment, market and other issues covered in Chapter III. The discussion has also&#13;
brought out that obtaining finance for the acquisition of second-hand vessels&#13;
and conversions is much more difficult than for new vessels.&#13;
5.03      Many LDCs have taken steps in recent years to establish or expand&#13;
their merchant fleets to carry part of their foreign trade in national flag&#13;
vessels (paras. 1.37 and 2.03), and further expansion is likely. The Conven-&#13;
tion on a Code of Conduct for Liner Conferences, supported by the LDCs but not&#13;
yet entered into force (para. 1.28), provides a basis for national liner&#13;
shipping companies to claim a share (such as 40%) of the country's conference&#13;
trades (para. 1.29). LDCs, as a group, are also pressing their right to an&#13;
"equitable participation" in the maritime transport of their foreign trade in&#13;
bulk commodities (para. 1.35) and the gradual phasing out of open registries&#13;
(para. 1.33).&#13;
5.04      To meet these objectives, on a public sector and country by country&#13;
basis, w1l1 involve not only large capital investments but also considerable&#13;
technical assistance for pre-investment studies and project implementation&#13;
and training for operations. These should be done with due consideration&#13;
to available alternatives, to long-term comparative advantages, to institu-&#13;
tional requirements, and with proper feasibility studies. Without such&#13;
considerations, ship acquisitions could prove uneconomic.&#13;

SEABORNE TRADE&#13;
1.        Maritime transport is an essential service industry for world trade&#13;
which in turn is of great importance for the world economy. Seaborne trade&#13;
has, in recent years, increased faster than world trade which has in turn grown&#13;
faster than the world economy. Thus, in constant 1975 prices, the value of&#13;
world exports, excluding those from non-market industrial economies (NIEs),&#13;
increased from 13% of the world gross domestic product (GDP) in 1960 to 20%&#13;
in 1975; for developing countries it was 23% in 1975. During the period as a&#13;
whole, exports in constant dollars increased by an average of 7.2% per annum&#13;
while GDP increased by 4.5% per annum 1/. During the same period the tonnage&#13;
of goods loaded in international seaborne trade, excluding NIEs, trebled from&#13;
1,030 million tons in 1960 to 3,144 in 1975, thus growing by an average of&#13;
7.7% per annum 2/. As the average distances over which the trade was carried&#13;
increased by almost 5'1% 3/ during the period, the growth in shipping demand&#13;
was actually much faster than the growth in seaborne trade tonnage or in GDP.&#13;
Although data are not available, it is clear that the bulk of the world trade&#13;
depends on maritime transport and that this is even more the case of developing&#13;
countries 4/. According to one estimate the cost of carriage of the world&#13;
seaborne trade was about US$90 billiorn 5/. The ocean freight bill for the&#13;
exports and imports of the ESCAP countries in 1976 has been estimated at US$28&#13;

editions.&#13;
3/   Based on OECD Maritime Transport 1970 and Fearnley and Egers Chartering&#13;
Co. Ltd. Review 1977. In 1975, the average distance of international&#13;
seaborne trade was about 5,050 nautical miles as compared with about 3,500&#13;
in 1966 and about 5,200 in 1977.&#13;
4/   According to a position paper by the ICC about 90 percent of the world&#13;
trade (by volume) is seaborne. The main overland trade is between&#13;
Canada and the United States, and between countries in Continental&#13;
Europe. International air freight, although increasing rapidly, is still&#13;
of minor importance in terms of the overall volume of international&#13;
trade.&#13;

billion 1/. Efficient and low cost maritime transport is therefore of great&#13;
importance to world trade and the world economy and particularly to developing&#13;
countries as these may often bear most of the freight costs on both their&#13;
exports and imports 2/. Maritime freight costs may add a significant percent-&#13;
age to the f.a.s. export value of their major export commodities and in other&#13;
cases be a barrier to exports to particular markets. Although according to&#13;
an UNCTAD estimate for the year 1970 maritime freight costs represented about&#13;
11% of the c.i.f. value of seaborne trade or an addition of 12% to the f.o.b.&#13;
value, the share is much higher for some of the relatively low value commodi-&#13;
ties exported by many developing countries 3/.&#13;
2.        International seaborne trade can be divided into three broad cate-&#13;
gories of commodities, i.e., petroleum and petroleum products (POL); important&#13;
dry bulk commodities which tend to move in full ship loads (e.g., iron ore,&#13;
grains, coal, etc.); and a large number of other items commonly classified as&#13;
"general" cargo.  Petroleum and petroleum products in 1976 accounted for about&#13;
53% of the world seaborne trade (66% in terms of ton-miles in 1977 due to the&#13;
longer average haul of petroleum of 7,300 nautical miles as compared with an&#13;
average of just under 5,200 for all seaborne trade) 4/, the important bulk&#13;
commodities for about 25% (23% of ton-miles) and general cargo for about 22%&#13;
(11% of ton-miles with an average distance of only about 2,300 nautical&#13;

(E/ESCAP/STC.2/30), pp. 26-27. These countries accounted for respectively&#13;

charged.&#13;

3/   According to an order of magnitude estimate of the UNCTAD secretariat&#13;
the maritime freight bill in 1970 was about US$23 billion or about 11&#13;
percent of the estimated c.i.f. seaborne import value in that year&#13;

which have been built in recent years, and by specialized carriers. Three&#13;
major developments in international shipping in recent years have been the&#13;
increased use of unit loads in liner shipping, particularly in the trades&#13;
between industrialized countries; the relative shift of certain so called&#13;
neo-bulk commodites from liners to bulk carriers or specialized vessels; and&#13;
the increasirg size of tankers and bulk carriers 3/.&#13;

TYPES OF SHIPPING SERVICES AND COMPETITION&#13;
1.        Normally shipping services are divided into three broad categories -&#13;
scheduled or liner services, tramp services, and industrial or private carriage.&#13;
Although these categories generally differ in the kind of services offered to&#13;
the users (shippers), the general types of goods carried, and to some extent&#13;
the kinds of vessels used, there exists a considerable overlap between the&#13;
categories l/.&#13;
a)   Liner Services&#13;
2.        Liner shipping generally involves regular scheduled services of break-&#13;
bulk or unitized cargo between specified ports, or ranges of ports, for the&#13;
transport of parcels of heterogenous cargoes. The types of vessels used in&#13;
liner services 2/ can in broad terms be referred to as conventional general&#13;
cargo vessels, container vessels, ro/ro vessels and barge carriers. However,&#13;
the distinction between these types of vessels is becoming blurred by the in-&#13;
crease in multipurpose vessels. Because of the large capital costs involved,&#13;
long-range ocean container operations are commonly carried out by consortia&#13;
of two or more traditional liner companies. Container services are particu-&#13;
larly common between high labor cost industrial countries, but are also&#13;
spreading to trades between these countries and certain LDCs. Ro/ro services&#13;
have been particularly prominent in short-sea-trades in the Mediterranean and&#13;
North and Baltic Seas and in the Gulf of Mexico, but have also been spreading&#13;
to deep-sea trades, particularly in the routes between developed countries and&#13;
the Middle East and West Africa, where port congestion has been prevalent.&#13;
3.        The shipowners involved in liner service offer their services to&#13;
any shipper wishing to use them at fixed freight rates 3/. Studies of&#13;
conference pricing have generally concluded that conference rates are based&#13;
l/   A particular operator may for instance use a vessel partly in a liner&#13;
service and partly as a tramp depending on the directional trade balance&#13;
at a given time or the relative market conditLons over time. Similarly,&#13;
some industrial carriers have also operated partly as common carrier&#13;
liner services.&#13;
2/   Westinform Shipping report No. 313, A Review of the World Conference&#13;
Liner Fleet contains an analysis of capacity, nuimber, flag, etc.&#13;
3/   Some commodities facing special competition from non-conference liners&#13;
or tramp vessels may sometimes be "open rated" to give the companies more&#13;
freedom to compete for the cargoes. Conferences commonly operate loyalty&#13;
arrangements to secure continued and exclusive patronage of shippers to&#13;
the conference (not a particular conference line). All "loyal" shippers&#13;
are supposed to pay the same irrespective of volume.&#13;

on what the traffic will bear and are related to both the value of the goods&#13;
and, to a lesser extent, to their size/weight ratios and other value or volume&#13;
characteristics 1/. Such rates apply to a range of ports. In most liner&#13;
trades, most operators serving a particular trade join together in cartel like&#13;
organizations called shipping conferences (see Annex 4 for more details).&#13;
While most public inquiries have, with qualifications, supported the conference&#13;
system 2/, some studies have indicated that conferences which do not regulate&#13;
sailings and cargo capacity may, as a result of competition for serv-ce have&#13;
excess capacity, and not optimal vessel numbers, types or sizes and therefore&#13;
result in relatively high freight rates 3/.&#13;
b)   Tramps&#13;
4.        A tramp vessel has been defined as "a freight vessel that does not&#13;
run in any regular line but takes cargo wherever the shippers desire" 4/ and&#13;

normally in full shiploads. The original tramp ship is a general purpose&#13;
carrier designed to carry most types of cargo. It is even occasionally hired&#13;
or chartered by liner companies for use in their liner trades. However, the&#13;
term may also include specialized ships such as oil tankers, ore carriers,&#13;
etc. which operate under similar commercial conditions 1/.&#13;
5.        Depend-ing onI tlhe contractual arrangements by which the services of&#13;
the vessels are made available, a distinction is often made between open market&#13;
fixtures or charters and negotiated fixtures. Voyage and time charters for&#13;
one year or less are generally fixed through brokers on the open market, e.g.,&#13;
at the Baltic Shipping Exchange in London, while on the other hand time&#13;
charters for three years and more and contracts of affreightment involving&#13;
the transport of a given quantity over a certain time period are normally&#13;
fixed through direct negotiations 2/.  Only a small proportion of all long-&#13;
term, dry cargo, charter business is reported 3/. The "open" charter market&#13;
generally represents close to perfect competition for short-term requirements,&#13;
with freight rates fluctuating substantially over time depending on changes in&#13;
1/   Excluding such vessels owned and operated by industrial concerns for&#13;
their own transport as discussed under Section B (ii) (c) below. Some&#13;
authors limit the term tramps to non-specialized general purpose tramp&#13;
vessels, e.g. B. N. Metaxas, The Economics of Tramp Shipping, The Athlone&#13;
Press, London 1971, p. 6.&#13;
2/   Freight Markets and the Level and Structure of Freight Rates (TD/B/C.4/38),&#13;
report by the UNCTAD secretariat, United Nations Publication, Sales No.&#13;
E.69.11.D.13, p. 11. This report describes the open market as follows:&#13;
"The open market embraces the aggregate at any given time of tramp ship-&#13;
owners seeking employment for their vessels and shippers requiring the&#13;
services of tramp ships for a limited period. The keynote of the open&#13;
freight market is the quick and easy communication of information. The&#13;
basis is an international network of shipowners, shipbrokers and charterers&#13;
needing a ship of a certain size and type available at a specific port on&#13;
or about a specified date can be assured that his needs will be made&#13;
known to shipowners in all countries which possess merchant fleets. In&#13;
the reverse direction, by circulating through the same network the&#13;
positions of his fleet and the cargoes most actively sought by individual&#13;
vessels the shipowner informs all potential hirers/charterers of the&#13;
shipping space he can offer, its nature and when and where it will be&#13;
free and available for service".&#13;
3/   According to one source only about 10% of the total tonnage carried&#13;
by non-liner methods are covered by fixtures reported on the open&#13;
market with the remaining 90% carried under private fixtures or by&#13;
industrial carriers [Merchant Fleet Development (UNCTAD/SHIP/127) p. 11].&#13;
With reference to dry bulk trades H.P. Drewry (Shipping Consultants)&#13;
Ltd. concluded that although reported time charts and contracts of&#13;
affreightment represent an extremely small proportion of all long-term&#13;
chart business, they are sufficient to gauge the market as a whole&#13;
[Organization and Structure of the Dry Bulk Shipping Industry p. 57].&#13;

demand and the relative demand/supply balance 1/. This is in turn influenced&#13;
by a host of factors, e.g., wars, political upheaval, weather, strikes, etc.&#13;
6.        Due to the absence of comprehensive information on chartering, parti-&#13;
cularly time chartering and contracts of affreightment, it is not possible to&#13;
indicate what proportion of the tramp fleet is under voyage or time charter.&#13;
This proportion also changes over time as most shi'P-c-tners tend to favor time&#13;
charter relatively more during periods of high rates than during periods of&#13;
low rates 2/.&#13;
c)   Industrial or Private Carriage&#13;
7.        Industrial cr private operations are captive services in which both&#13;
ships and cargoes are controlled by a single entity. These are not, however,&#13;
completely isolated markets as the companies tend to supplement their own&#13;
tonnage by time or spot fixtures and may, on occasion, also charter out some&#13;
tonnage or make part of the space available to other shippers. Vessels&#13;
chartered by industrial operators on bareboat charter closely resemble owned&#13;
tonnage insofar as they are usually operated by the charterer as if he were&#13;
the real owner during the period of the charter.&#13;
1/   The single voyage dirty tanker freight rate index (Worldscale = 100)&#13;
increased from 56 in the first quarter of 1972 to 357 in the third&#13;
quarter of 1973 and fell to 65 in the first quarter of 1975. Similarly,&#13;
the United Kingdom Chamber of Shipping tramps time charter index increased&#13;
from 98 (1968 = 100) in the third quarter of 1972 to 358 in the fourth&#13;
quarter of 1973 and fell again to 94 in the second quarter of 1975.&#13;
During this latter period the liner freight rate index of the Ministry&#13;
of Transport of the Federal Republic of Germany increased continuously,&#13;
although at different rates, from 132 to 148 and 201 [Review of Maritime&#13;
Transport, 1974 and 1976, reports by the UNCTAD secretariat (TD/B/C.4/125&#13;
and 169].&#13;
2/   The reported single voyage dry cargo chartering increased from 69.9 million&#13;
cargo tons in 1973 to 81.7 million tons cargo in 1977. With regard to&#13;
time chartering, trip chartering increased from 31.6 million tons dwt to&#13;
53.7 million tons dwt while long-term time chartering declined from&#13;
about 17.1 million tons dwt in 1973 to 5.7 million in 1977. For tankers,&#13;
reported spot cargo fixing (dirty single voyage and clean single voyage&#13;
chartering) increased from 176.5 million cargo tons in 1973 to 385.9&#13;
million in 1977 while period chartering declined from a record 65.0 mil-&#13;
lion tons dwt in 1973 to 31.3 million in 1977. Also while only 33%&#13;
of the period chartered tonnage was for 12 months or less in 1973, it&#13;
accounted for 76% in 1977. [H.P. Drewry (Shipping Consultants) Ltd.&#13;
Shipping Statistics, July 1977 and January 1978, Tanker Chartering Through&#13;
the 1970s, study number 53 and and Organization and Structure of the Dry&#13;

8.        According to H.P. Drewry (Shipping Consultant) Ltd., the seven major&#13;
petroleum companies owned about 69 million dwt of tanker tonnage or 21% of the&#13;
fleet in mid-1977, while other oil companies owned 19% and the independent&#13;
owners 60%. The increasing tanker ownership of the other oil companies,&#13;
including companies of the developing oil exporting countries, can be seen&#13;
from the fact that these companies accounted for about 46% of new tanker&#13;
tonnage on order in mid-1977 and that the tonnage on order for these companies&#13;
represented aboi 24% of their existing tonnage as compared with 5% for the&#13;
seven major and 7% for the independents 1/. Although similar information is&#13;
not available for the dry cargo trades, it is known that certain mining,&#13;
steel-making and other companies control directly or indirectly through&#13;
shipping subsidiaries or beneficially-owned offshore companies considerable&#13;
tonnages of bulk carriers, including combined carriers 2/. As in the case of&#13;
tankers, these vessels are often registered under flags of convenience 3/.&#13;
(d) Competition by Type of Shipping&#13;
9.        Shipping is often looked upon as an example of a free trade indus-&#13;
try. While this is largely true for open market chartering, it is not true for&#13;
shipping as a whole, nor has it really been true for any length of time in&#13;
the past 4/. This situation varies, however, by shipping service and from&#13;
trade to trade or country to country.&#13;

10.       Furthermore, the shipping industry has certain oligopolistic or semi-&#13;
oligopolistic features which have become more pronounced as a result of in-&#13;
creases in containerization, with its large capital requirements, increased&#13;
vessel sizes and the trend towards consortia or pools for both containers and&#13;
bulk shipping. The conference system tends to eliminate price competition&#13;
between member companies in a particular trade, although service competition&#13;
may continue, 'as may competition between conference lines on the one hand and&#13;
non-conference lines, tramps or other modes of transport on the other. The&#13;
strength of conferences and the degree of outside competition varies, however,&#13;
significantly between trades 1/. In part of the bulk trades, both liquid and&#13;
dry, the existence of a relatively limited number of large shippers (e.g.,&#13;
major petroleum companies, steel companies, etc.) who control substantial&#13;
shipping tonnages through direct vessel ownership or long-term charters or&#13;
contracts of affreightment also introduces some oligopsonistic features.&#13;
11.       The competitive situation in particular trades can also be influ-&#13;
enced by a large number of actions taken by Governments, particularly those&#13;
taken to develop or assist their national merchant marines. These measures,&#13;
as listed in more detail in Annex 12, can be divided into measures involving&#13;
(i) flag discrimination or reservation and (ii) subsidies and tax advantages&#13;
or other direct and indirect forms of financial assistance. Another way of&#13;
looking at these measures is to separate them into measures aimed at increasing&#13;
revenues for national flag lines and measures aimed at reducing costs, includ-&#13;
ing measures to offset particular competitive disadvantages which may be&#13;
partly related to government policy 2/. The competitive situation in shipping&#13;
affected by the existence and rapid expansion of the fleets registered in so-&#13;
called open registry countries where shipowners may benefit inter alia from&#13;
(i) freedom from taxation of profits and income and uncontrolled use of the&#13;
cash flow and (ii) the possibility of reducing operating costs by inter alia&#13;
using lower paid crews 3/. Finally, the competitive situation in certain&#13;
liner trades has also been influenced in recent years by the expansion of&#13;
the fleets of centrally planned economies which in several cases (particularly&#13;
the USSR) operate independent services quoting rates significantly below&#13;
those of the shipping conferences.&#13;
1/   With regards to the U.S. liner trades, a 1977 study by the U.S. Depart-&#13;
ment of Justice concluded inter alia that "conference power is not&#13;
effectively constained by market forces or by regulation "(The Regulated&#13;
Ocean Shipping Industry, U.S. Government Printing Office, January 1977,&#13;
p. 237). However, this conclusion was disputed by the earlier cited&#13;
UWIST study.&#13;

pensate for a requirement to build vessels at relatively high cost&#13;

12.       From the point of view of LDCs considering developing or expanding&#13;
their national merchant marines, several of the above-mentioned factors may&#13;
negatively affect the potential benefits from such investments. Thus, the&#13;
existence of direct or indirect subsidies to shipping and the relative lower&#13;
cost of shipping under open flag registry may reduce or eliminate the compara-&#13;
tive advantage that developing countries might have due to lower crew costs,&#13;
reduce the benefits which might accrue to these countries through reduced&#13;
taxes, etc 1/. On the other hand the existence of subsidies, special tax&#13;
provisions, etc. may result in lower freight rates than would be the case&#13;
without such subsidies and therefore benefit international trade in highly&#13;
price-sensitive cargoes. The oligopolistic features of some shipping markets&#13;
and control of cargoes by trading partners may also make entry into shipping&#13;
more difficult. Such entry is, however, relatively easier in liner shipping&#13;
where price competition is restricted and where the conferences increasingly&#13;
have come to accept the "right" of national flag lines to a share of the trade&#13;
to and from that country or in bulk trades (liquid and dry) if there is&#13;
national control of the cargoes or agreement between trading partners.&#13;
1/   The above UNCTAD report argues, although without evidence, that a serious&#13;
consequence of open registry shipping is that "resources which would&#13;
logically be directed towards the development of the national fleets of&#13;
developing countries which can provide the necessary labor are in fact&#13;
being diverted in such a manner that the industrialized countries are&#13;
retaining the benefits of shipowning." (ibid. p. 74.).&#13;

SHIPPING CONFERENCES&#13;
1.        The United Nations Code of Conduct for Liner Conferences defines a&#13;
liner conference as:&#13;
"A group of two or more vessel-operating carriers which&#13;
provides international liner services for the carriage of&#13;
cargo on a particular route or routes within specified geo-&#13;
graphical limits and which has an agreement or arrangement,&#13;
whatever its nature, within the framework of which they&#13;
operate under uniform or common freight rates and any other&#13;
agreed conditions with respect to the provision of liner&#13;
services" 1/.&#13;
The organization and scope of the conferences, of which there are about 360 2/,&#13;
vary widely ranging from fairly informal associations to a tightly structured&#13;
organization with a permanent secretariat. The most tightly organized type&#13;
of conference is the "closed" conference operating a rationalized service and&#13;
pooling arrangement whereby the number of sailings and vessel types and&#13;
capacities are tailored to the expected traffic volumes and thus potentially,&#13;
although not necessarily in practice, minimizing the costs of providing the&#13;
service but also greatly reducing the competition between member liners 3/.&#13;
On the other hand weaker "open" conferences concerned mostly with establishing&#13;
freight rates, while not reducing competition to the same extent, may tend to&#13;
encourage over-tonnaging, low profitability and steadily increasing freight&#13;

are contained in Croner's World Directory of Freight Conferences; Croner&#13;
Publications Limited. An extensive discussion of the nature of shipping&#13;
conferences can also be found in The Liner Conference System, op. cit.&#13;
3/   Through various loyalty arrangements, the conference may also try to&#13;
minimize the outside competition from non-conference liner operators&#13;
and tramps. The market power of a conference depends on its own orga-&#13;
nization, the extent of outside competition from non-conference liners&#13;
and tramps and other modes of transport or services as well as market&#13;
competition for individual commodities in that too high a rate might make&#13;
the commodity uncompetitive.&#13;

rates; rates may be much higher than under an efficient system 1/. This is&#13;
particularly important to developing countries as these may often bear most&#13;
of the freight cost of both their exports and imports. However, as far as&#13;
is known, no study has been undertaken regarding the relative position of&#13;
rationalized and unrationalized conference operations.&#13;
2.        Most public inquiries, such as the Rochdale report, as well as most&#13;
liner companies and major organizations of shippers, have favored some form of&#13;
conference system over unregulated free competition in liner trades due to&#13;
the cost structure and other characteristics of liner shipping and the stated&#13;
need of shippers for stable freight rates and regular service. The need for&#13;
some regulation of conferences has gained increasing, although far from&#13;
unanimous, acceptance 2/.&#13;
1/   Devanney, Livanos and Steward have referred to this process as the&#13;
"cartel spiral".  Starting from a conference having agreed to a tariff&#13;
level and structure which would provide an acceptable level of profit&#13;
"Given such a profitable level of rates, an individual firm can increase&#13;
its profits by increasing tie tonnage on the route.  However, the other&#13;
firms reason in a similar manner. Hence, more tonnage is supplied,&#13;
utilization goes down, and with it the profits. The conference meets&#13;
and increases in rates, whereupon it becomes profitable to add tonnage&#13;
and the process repeats itself". The authors concluded that the cost&#13;
of the existing conference operation was twice as high as under an effi-&#13;
cient system. [Conference Rate Making in the West Coast of South America,&#13;
1972] B.J. Abrahamsson," A Model of Liner Price Setting, Journal of&#13;
Transport Economics and Policy, September 1968, pp. 321-331 distinguished&#13;
between freight rate increases due to 1) monopoly power 2) shift in the&#13;
average cost curve, 3) compersatory increases and 4) higher unit costs&#13;
from withdrawal from tramp market.&#13;
2/   To a different degree this is reflected in (i) the existing United States&#13;
maritime legislation and regulation, (ii) the liner code agreed between&#13;
the Council of European and Japanese National Shipowners' Association and&#13;
The European National Shippers' Council following a recommendation of&#13;
the Consultative Shipping Group (representing the Governments of twelve&#13;
Western European Countries and Japan), and (iii) the Utnited Nations&#13;
Convention on a Code of Conduct for Liner Conferences. Two recent and&#13;
opposing studies of the conference system with particular reference to&#13;
the US trades and which also contain references to most earlier inquiries&#13;
and studies are The Regulated Ocean Shipping Industry op. cit. (favoring&#13;
free competition) and Liner Shipping in the US Trades, op. cit. (support-&#13;
ing the conference system).&#13;

EXCERPT FROM THE CONVENTION ON A CODE OF CONDUCT&#13;
FOR LINER CONFERENCES&#13;
Chapter II&#13;
RELATIONS AMONG MEMBER LINES&#13;
Article 1&#13;
MEMBERSHIP&#13;
1.   Any national shipping line shall have the right to be a full member of&#13;
a conference which serves the foreign trade of its country, subject to the&#13;
criteria set out in article 1, paragraph 2. Shipping lines which are not&#13;
national lines in any trade of a conference shall have the right to become&#13;
full members of that conference, subject to the criteria set out in article 1,&#13;
paragraphs 2 and 3, and to the provisions regarding the share of trade as set&#13;
out in article 2 as regards third-country shipping lines.&#13;
2.   A shipping line applying for membership of a conference shall furnish&#13;
evidence of its ability and intention, which may include the use of chartered&#13;
tonnage, provided the criteria of this paragraph are met, to operate a regular,&#13;
adequate and efficient service on a long-term basis as defined in the confer-&#13;
ence agreement within the framework of the conference, shall undertake to&#13;
abide by all the terms and conditions of the conference agreement, and shall&#13;
deposit a financial guarantee to cover any outstanding financial obligation&#13;
in the event of subsequent withdrawal, suspension or expulsion from member-&#13;
ship, if so required under the conference agreement.&#13;
3.   In considering an application for membership by a shipping line which is&#13;
not a national line in any trade of the conference concerned, in addition to&#13;
the provisions of article 1, paragraph 2, the following criteria, inter alia,&#13;
should be taken into account:&#13;
(a) The existing volume of the trade on the route or routes served&#13;
by the conference and prospects for its growth;&#13;
(b) The adequacy of shipping space for the existing and prospective&#13;
volume of trade on the route or routes served by the conference;&#13;
(c) The probable effect of admission of the shipping line to the&#13;
conference on the efficiency and quality of the conference&#13;
service;&#13;
(d) The current participation of the shipping line in trade on the&#13;
same route or routes outside the framework of a conference; and&#13;
(e) The current participation of the shipping line on the same route&#13;
or routes within the framework of another conference.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;

Page 2 of 5&#13;
The above criteria shall not be applied so as to subvert the implementa-&#13;
tion of the provisions relating to participation in trade set out in article 2.&#13;
4.   An application for admission or readmission to membership shall be&#13;
promptly decided upon and the decision communicated by a conference to an&#13;
applicant promptly, and in no case later than six months from the date of&#13;
application. When a shipping line is refused admission or readmission the&#13;
conference shall, at the same time, give in writing the grounds for such&#13;
refusal.&#13;
5.   When considering applications for admission, a conference shall take into&#13;
account the views put forward Dy shippers and shippers    organizations of the&#13;
countries whose trade is carried by the conference, as well as the views of&#13;
appropriate authorities if they so request.&#13;
6.   In addition to the criteria for admission set out in article 1, para-&#13;
graph 2, a shipping line applying for re-admission shall also give evidence&#13;
of having fulfilled its obligations in accordance with article 4, paragraphs&#13;
1 and 4. The conference may give special scrutiny to the circumstances under&#13;
which the line left the conference.&#13;
Article 2&#13;
PARTICIPATION IN TRADE&#13;
1.   Any shipping line admitted to membership of a conference shall have&#13;
sailing and loading rights in the trades covered by that conference.&#13;
2.   When a conference operates a pool, all shipping lines members of the&#13;
conference serving the trade covered by the pool shall have the right to&#13;
participate in the pool for that trade.&#13;
3.   For the purpose of determining the share of trade which member lines&#13;
shall have the right to acquire, the national shipping -lines of each country,&#13;
irrespective of the number of lines, shall be regarded as a single group of&#13;
shipping lines for that country.&#13;
4.   When determining a share of trade within a pool of individual member&#13;
lines and/or groups of national shipping lines in accordance with article 2,&#13;
paragraph 2, the following principles regarding their right to participation&#13;
in the trade carried by the conference shall be observed, unless otherwise&#13;
mutually agreed:&#13;
(a) The group of national shipping lines of each of two countries&#13;
the foreign trade beLween which is carried by the conference&#13;
shall have equal rights to participate in the freight and&#13;
volume of traffic generated by their mutual foreign trade&#13;
and carried by the conference;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -&#13;
ANNEX 5&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
(b) Third-country shipping lines, if any, shall have the right&#13;
to acquire a significant part, such as 20 percent, in the&#13;
freight and volume of traffic generated by that trade.&#13;
5.   If, for any one of the countries whose trade is carried by a conference,&#13;
there are no national shipping lines participating in the carriage of that&#13;
trade, the share of the trade to which national shipping lines of that country&#13;
would be entitled under article 2, paragraph 4 shall be distributed among the&#13;
individual member lines participating in the trade in proportion to their&#13;
respective share.&#13;
6.   If the national shipping lines of one country decide not to carry their&#13;
full share of the trade, that portion of their share of the trade which they&#13;
do not carry shall be distributed among the individual member lines partici-&#13;
pating in the trade in proportion to their respective shares.&#13;
7.   If the national shipping lines of the countries concerned do not par-&#13;
ticipate in the trade between those countries covered by a conference, the&#13;
shares of trade carried by the conference between those countries shall be&#13;
allocated between the participating member lines of third countries by&#13;
commercial negotiations between those lines.&#13;
8.   The national shipping lines of a region, members of a conference, at one&#13;
end of the trade covered by the conference, may redistribute among themselves&#13;
by mutual agreement the shares in trades allocated to them, in accordance with&#13;
article 2, paragraphs 4 to 7 inclusive.&#13;
9.   Subject to the provisions of article 2, paragraphs 4 to 8 inclusive&#13;
regarding shares of trade among individual shipping line or groups of ship-&#13;
ping lines, pooling or trade-sharing agreements shall be reviewed by the&#13;
conference periodically, at intervals to be stipulated in those agreements&#13;
and in accordance with criteria to be specified in the conference agreement.&#13;
10. The application of the present article shall commence as soon as possible&#13;
after entry into force of the present Convention and shall be completed within&#13;
a transition period which in no case shall be longer than two years, taking&#13;
into account the specific situation in each of the trades concerned.&#13;
11. Shipping lines members of a conference shall be entitled to operate&#13;
chartered ships to fulfill their conference obligations.&#13;
12. The criteria for sharing and the revision of shares as set out in&#13;
article 2, paragraphs 1 to 11 inclusive shall apply when, in the absence&#13;
of a pool, there exists berthing, sailing and/or any other form of cargo&#13;
allocation agreement.&#13;
13. Where no pooling, berthing, sailing or other trade participation agree-&#13;
ments exist in a conference, either group of national shipping lines members&#13;
of the conference, may require that pooling arrangements be introduced, in&#13;
respect of the trade between their countries carried by the conference, in&#13;
&#13;

conformity with the provisions of article 2, paragraph 4; or alternatively&#13;
they may require that the sailings be so adjusted as to provide an opportunity&#13;
to these lines to enjoy substantially the same rights to participate in the&#13;
trade between those two countries carried by the conference as they would have&#13;
enjoyed under the provisions of article 2, paragraph 4. Any such request&#13;
shall be considered and decided by the conference. If there is no agreement&#13;
to institute such a pool or adjustment of sailings among the members of the&#13;
conference, the groups of national shipping lines of the countries at both&#13;
ends of the trade shall have a majority vote in deciding to establish such a&#13;
pool or adjustment of sailings. The matter shall be decided upon within a&#13;
period not exceeding six months from the receipt of the request.&#13;
14. In the event of a disagreement between the national shipping lines of&#13;
the countries at either end whose trade is served by the conference with&#13;
regard to whether or not pooling shall be introduced, they may require that&#13;
within the conferenice sailings be so adjusted as to provide an opportunity&#13;
to these lines to enjoy substantially the same rights to participate in the&#13;
trade between those two countries carried by the conference as they would&#13;
have enjoyed under the provisions of article 2, paragraph 4. In the event&#13;
that there are no national shipping lines in one of the countries whose&#13;
trade is served by the conference, the national shipping line or lines of&#13;
the other country may make the same request. The conference shall use its&#13;
best endeavors to meet this request. If, however, this request is not met,&#13;
the appropriate authorities of the countries at both ends of the trade may&#13;
take up the matter if they so wish and make their views known to the parties&#13;
concerned for their consideration. If no agreement is reached, the dispute&#13;
shall be dealt with in accordance with the procedures established in this&#13;
Code.&#13;
15. Other shipping lines, members of a conference, may also request that&#13;
pooling or sailing agreements be introduced, and the request shall be con-&#13;
sidered by the conference in accordance with the relevant provisions of&#13;
this Code.&#13;
16. A conference shall provide for appropriate measures in any conference&#13;
pooling agreement to cover cases where the cargo has been shut out by a member&#13;
line for any reason excepting late presentation by the shipper. Such agree-&#13;
ment shall provide that a vessel with unbooked space, capable of being used,&#13;
be allowed to lift the cargo, even in excess of the pool share of the line&#13;
in the trade, if otherwise the cargo would be shut out and delayed beyond&#13;
a period set by the conference.&#13;
17. The provisions of article 2, paragraphs 1 to, 16 inclusive concern all&#13;
goods regardless of their origin, their destination or the use for which&#13;
they are intended, with the exception of military eqjipaent for national&#13;
defence purposes.&#13;

SHIPPING AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR MERCHANT MARINES&#13;
Resolution 120 (V) of June 3, 1979 by the United Nations Conference&#13;
on Trade and Development 1/&#13;
The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development,&#13;
Recalling its resolution 70 (III) of 19 May 1972, which recognized that&#13;
developing countries should have an increasing and substantial participation&#13;
in the carriage of maritime cargoes,&#13;
Recaliing also General Assembly resolution 3202 (S-VI) of 1 May 1974,&#13;

and which noted with concern the present position of the fleets of developing&#13;
countries among the world merchant fleets, in particular .&gt;mong the tanker and&#13;
bulk carrier fleets,&#13;
Noting that no appreciable progress has been made in the area of ship-&#13;

Considering that the insignificant share of developing countries in the&#13;
carriage of bulk cargoes and refrigerated cargoes is a matter for serious&#13;
concern,&#13;
Recognizing the right of all countries to an equitable participation in&#13;
the carriage of cargoes generated by their own foreign trade, especially in&#13;
th bulk sectors,&#13;
Convinced that there is a particular need to overcome the obstacles in&#13;
increasing participation of developing countries in international shipping,&#13;
Taking note of the desire of many countries to phase out open-registry&#13;
operations,&#13;
Taking note also of the report of the Ad Hoc Intergovernmental Working&#13;
Group on the Economic Consequences of the Existence or Lack of a Genuine&#13;
Link between Vessel and Flag of Registry which met in Geneva in February&#13;
1978 and of the resolution adopted by it,&#13;
1.   Calls upon governments to take steps to ensure for developing&#13;
countries equitable participation in the transport of all cargoes, and&#13;
more specially bulk cargoes, generated by their own foreign trade by&#13;
national vessels of the respective trading countries or by vessels&#13;
otherwise operated by them;&#13;
2.   Recommends the application of the following principles, taking&#13;
into account pragmatic considerations:&#13;
(a) That the transport of regular bulk and refrigerated cargo&#13;
between a pair of exporting and importing countries should have&#13;
equitable participation by the national lines of the respective&#13;
trading countries, or by vessels otherwise operated by them;&#13;
(b) That other bulk and refrigerated cargoes should be the&#13;
subject of bilateral agreements between the trading partner coun-&#13;
tries providing for the equitable participation in the trades by&#13;
the national lines of these trading partner countries;&#13;
(c) That until developing countries achieve an equitable&#13;
share of world tonnage, contracts between developing and developed&#13;
countries for the sale or purchase of bulk cargoes, or for the&#13;
exploitation of natural resources which give rise to bulk cargoes,&#13;
should stipulate that a substantial and increasing portion of&#13;
cargoes shall be carried by the national vessels of developing&#13;
countries or by vessels operated by them;&#13;
3.   Urges developing countries which import bulk cargoes especially in&#13;
less-than-ship-load quantities to take measures among themselves for joint bulk&#13;
shipping operations in cooperation with the exportirng developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

4.   Requests:&#13;
(a) The UNCTAD secretariat to identify the movements of bulk&#13;
cargoes between developing countries which might form the basis of joint&#13;
fleet development by developing exporting and developing importing countries,&#13;
and also the less-than-ship-load bulk imports of developing countries which&#13;
might form a basis for joint bulk shipping operations;&#13;
(b) The Secretary-General of UNCTAD to call a meeting of represent-&#13;
atives of interested governments with a view to taking measures which would&#13;
ensure that, as far as feasible, all bulk cargoes shipped between developing&#13;
countries should be carried on vessels of the national lines of the respec-&#13;
tive trading countries or by vessels otherwise operated by them;&#13;
5.   Requests the UNCTAD secretariat to undertake in-depth studies of&#13;
the possibilities of expanding bulk fleets of developing countries on spe-&#13;
cific bulk trade routes, and to examine the manner in which the cargo is&#13;
currently tied to Jrading partner countries or to transnational corporations;&#13;
6.   Requests the UNCTAD secretariat to investigate, in cooperation with&#13;
the appropriate bodies, the controls which are exercised by transnational&#13;
corporations over bulk movements of commodities such as iron ore, coal,&#13;
grain, phosphate, and bauxite/alumina;&#13;
7.   Requests the UNCTAD secretariat to undertake in-depth studies on&#13;
trade and maritime transport of refrigerated cargoes, both liner and non-&#13;
liner, and to recommend measures to promote the increasing participation of&#13;
developing countries in the carriage of such cargoes;&#13;
8.   Requests the UNCTAD secretariat to:&#13;
(a) Prepare guidelines to assist developing countries in the&#13;
introduction of containerization and multimodal transport and the moderniza-&#13;
tion and improvement of their infrastructure, including ports, so that those&#13;
countries can derive the maximum benefit from new technologies;&#13;
(b) Carry out, in cooperation with ICAO, appropriate studies,&#13;
on air-cargo movements in the context of multimodal transport so as to&#13;
increase the air transport fleets of developing countries and to facilitate&#13;
the export of goods by air as desirable;&#13;
9.   Calls upon the Committee on Shipping to review at its regular&#13;
sessions the whole question of the participation of developing countries in&#13;
vorld shipping and the development of their merchant fleets, and the problems&#13;
with which developing countries are confronted;&#13;
10. Calls upon the UNCTAD secretariat, in consultation with other&#13;
related agencies to:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
84 -&#13;
ANNEX 6&#13;
Page 4&#13;
(a) undertake further studies in respect of the repercussions&#13;
of phasing out open registries, its economic and social impact on the eco-&#13;
nomies of developing countries, its effect on world shipping, and how the&#13;
phasing out of open registries would ensure simultaneous development of the&#13;
merchant fleets of developing countries, with a view to taking a decision on&#13;
the desirability of phasing out;&#13;
(b) Simultaneously study the feasibility of establishing a legal&#13;
mechanism for regulating the operations of open-registry fleets during the&#13;
corresponding period, stressing the need to adopt such legislative measures&#13;
as might enable them to ensure that substandard vessels do not operate to&#13;
their disadvantage;&#13;
11. Requests the Secretary-General of UNCTAD to reconvene the Ad Hoc&#13;
Intergovernmental Working Group for the purpose of considering these studies&#13;
on phasing out of open-registry operations.&#13;
12. Requests the Ad Hoc Intergovernmental Working Group to report its&#13;
conclusions and recommendations to the Trade and Development Board or the&#13;
Committee on Shipping, whichever session takes place earlier, for decisions,&#13;
as might be appropriate.&#13;

Recalling also resolutions 24 (VII) of 21 November 1975 and 32 (VIII)&#13;
of 22 April 1977 of the Committee on Shipping,&#13;
Expressing concern that the recommendations of Conference resolution&#13;
70 (III) of 19 May 1972 on the development of merchant marines have not been&#13;
fully implemented,&#13;
Recognizing that urgent action needs to be taken to enable the developing&#13;
countries to have an increasing and substantial participation in the carriage&#13;
of maritime cargoes, and in particular to facilitate the financing of ship&#13;
acquisition.&#13;
Noting that the lack of competently prepared feasibility studies is&#13;
sometimes an important restricting factor in ship finance,&#13;
Recognizing the need for technical and rinancial assistance for the&#13;
development oi the shipping industries, as well as of pDrts, in developing&#13;
countries,&#13;

Recognizing also the role being played by UNCTAD, the Intergovernmental&#13;
Maritime Consultative Organization and other United Nations organizations,&#13;
developed countries and international financial institutions offering develop-&#13;
ment aid in providing technical assistance, including training, to developing&#13;
countries in the above-mentioned fields,&#13;
Noting that existing resources within the United Nations system, includ-&#13;
ing UNCTAD, may not be sufficient to meet the requirements of developing&#13;
countries in the above-mentioned fields,&#13;
1.   Urges Governments of States members of UNCTAD, in view of the&#13;
urgent economic problems of developing countries and their limited resources,&#13;
to consider carefully the proposals made by the developinig countries at the&#13;
fifth session of the Conference that credit for the acquisition of ships&#13;
should be extended to them on the following minimum terms and conditions:&#13;
(a) a maximum loan duration of not less than 14 years for new ships&#13;
and 10 years for second-hand vessels, including a period of grace of at&#13;
least three years after the delivery of the vessels;&#13;
(b) down-payments not exceeding 10 percent of the contract price;&#13;
'(c) the rate of interest for such deferred payment should not&#13;
exceed 5 percent per annum;&#13;
2.   Requests the Governments of States members of UNCTAD, as well as&#13;
the international financial institutions offering development aid, to assist&#13;
developing countries so that they have access to bilateral and multilateral&#13;
development aid for the purchase of new ot second-hand ships, and for the&#13;
improvement and development of port facilities and infrastructure, taking&#13;
account of the developing countries- own development priorities and in accord-&#13;
ance with the aid policies of the donor countries and institutions concerned;&#13;
3.   Requests international financial institutions, in accordance with&#13;
their aid policies, to provide financing and refinancing facilities to govern-&#13;
mental and intergovernmental (including regional) financial institutions of&#13;
developing countries in their lending for ship acquisition;&#13;
4.   Calls upon developed and developing countries to encourage compa-&#13;
nies which have the required managerial and operational expertise in shipping&#13;
to participate in joint ventures with companies in developing countries where&#13;
a suitable framework exists. Joint ventures enable developing countries to&#13;
acquire vessels as well as managerial and operatioinal expertise. They can&#13;
take place either amongst companies from developed and developing countries&#13;
or amongst companies from developing countries;&#13;
5.   Requests the Secretary-General of UNCTAD to establish an ad hoc&#13;
unit within UNCTAD to assist developing countries with feasibility studies&#13;
for ship acquisition, subj(ect to the necessary resources being made available.&#13;

EXTRACT FROM THE REPORT OF THE GROUP OF EXPERTS ON IMPROVED METHODS OF&#13;
FINANCING SHIP ACQUISITION BY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (TD/B/C.4/179)&#13;
Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations&#13;
At its closing meeting, on 2 June 1978, the Group of Experts adopted&#13;
the following conclusions and recommendations:&#13;
(1)  In the assessment by the Group of Experts, about US$2 billion to&#13;
US$3 billion would be required per annum to finance the shipping&#13;
investments necessary to enable developing countries to reach&#13;
and maintain the target of 10 percent of total world deadweight&#13;
tonnage by 1980.&#13;
(2) The lack of finance on suitable conditions has been a factor&#13;
which has restricted the establishment and/or growth of the&#13;
merchant marines of developing countries. In many instances&#13;
financing as such is available on commercial terms but does not&#13;
materialize as a result of other factors. A major problem for&#13;
developing coun 'Jes is the terms and conditions of such credits.&#13;
(3) Most credits which do not involve development aid are not suitable&#13;
to meet the needs of developing countries. In particular, the&#13;
maximum loan duration should be increased to 12-14 years, including&#13;
an adequate period of grace. Similarly, down payment should be&#13;
10 to 20 percent of the contract period.&#13;
(4) Notwithstanding the world surplus of tonnage, it is generally&#13;
easier to arrange for financing of new buildings than for second-&#13;
hand ships, for the time being especially because financial credit&#13;
resources are being directed towards maintaining employment in&#13;
shipyards.&#13;
(5) Developed and developing countries should explore together&#13;
thoroughly the possibilities of using bilateral and multilateral&#13;
development aid for the acquisition of second-hand ships.&#13;
(6) Although ship-leasing arrangements could be suit-:ble in a&#13;
number of cases, this would not be a workable method for the&#13;
acquisition of a large number of ships by developing countries.&#13;
(7) Joint ventures between developed and developing countries, as&#13;
well as among developing countries themselves, offer considerable&#13;
possibilities for developing countries to acquire vessels as&#13;
well as management and operational expertise.&#13;
(8) Lack of competently prepared feasibility studies is a very&#13;
important restricting factor for ship finance. To assist developing&#13;
countries with feasibility studies a unit could be established within&#13;
UNCTAD.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -&#13;
ANNEX 9&#13;
Page 2&#13;
(9) Countries wishing to borrow for ship financing need appropriate&#13;
maritime legislation, arbitration provisions, a proper ship register&#13;
and appropriate inspection services. Assistance for such purposes&#13;
is provided by multilateral bodies or may be obtained on a bilateral&#13;
basis.&#13;
(10)  Lack of secure employment or access to profitable cargoes for the&#13;
vessels lias restricted the availability of finance to developing&#13;
countries. Developing countries should, where feasible, renegotiate&#13;
the relevant contracts so as to secure a portion of cargoes for their&#13;
own vessels.&#13;
(11)  Setting up a new financing institution specialized in shipping&#13;
does not seem necessary. The existing multilateral aid bodies&#13;
are adequately structured to meet the needs of developing countries&#13;
in this respect if these bodies pay more attention to shipping&#13;
development.&#13;
(12)  An information service on ship financing should possibly be&#13;
attached to the Information Service on Technical Assistance&#13;
in Shipping which is being established in the UNCTAD secretariat.&#13;
(13)  Concerning ship financing there is a need for regular assessments&#13;
of the financial needs of developing countries and for suggestions&#13;
on the mobilization of financial resources. These tasks could be&#13;
carried out by the Shipping Committee or by a consultative group,&#13;
as may be considered appropriate and necessary.&#13;

EXTRACTS FROM SELECTED INTERNATIONAL RESOLUTIONS&#13;
REGARDING MERCHANT FLEETS OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES&#13;
1.   United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2626(xxv) of October 24, 1970&#13;
The General Assembly:&#13;
1.   Proclaims the Second United Nations Development Decade starting&#13;
from 1 January 1971;&#13;
2.   Adopts the following International Development Strategy for the&#13;
Decade:" ...&#13;
4. invisibles, including shipping&#13;
"The objective is to promote, by national and international&#13;
action, the earnings of developing countries from invisible trade&#13;
and to minimize the net outflow of foreign exchange from those&#13;
countries arising from invisible transactions, including shipping.&#13;
In pursuance of the objective, action should be taken, inter alia,&#13;
in the following areas, by Governments and international organi-&#13;
zations and, where necessary, appropriately involving liner con-&#13;
ferences, shippers' councils and other relevant bodies.&#13;
(a) The principle that the national shipping lines of developing&#13;
countries should be admitted as full members of liner conferences&#13;
operating in their national maritime trade and have an increasing&#13;
and substantial participation in the carriage of cargoes generated&#13;
by their foreign trade should be implemented in the Decade ...&#13;
(b) In order that the developing countries may have an increasing&#13;
and substantial participation in the carriage of maritime cargoes,&#13;
and recognizing the need to reverse the existing trend whereby the&#13;
share of the developing countries in the world merchant fleet has&#13;
been declining instead of increasing, developing countries should&#13;
be enabled to expand their national and multinational merchant&#13;
marines through the adoption of such measures as may be appropriate&#13;
to permit their shipowners to compete in the international freight&#13;
market and thus contribute to a sound development of shipping" ...&#13;
2.   United Nations Conference on Trade and Development Resolution 70(iii) of&#13;
May 19, 1972 [United Nations Publication Sales No.E.73.II.D.4, Vol. 1&#13;
pp. 101-102]&#13;
The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development:&#13;
"Taking note of the aim of the developing countries to acquire,&#13;
by the end of the Second United Nations Development Decade, at&#13;
least 10 percent of the deadweight tonnage of the tot:al world&#13;
Fleet as compared to 7.1 percent in 1970"...&#13;

"Urges that ...&#13;
The States members of UNCTAD should as far as possible take part&#13;
in contributing to the achievement of the aim of the developing&#13;
countries to acquire at least 10 percent of the deadweight tonnage&#13;
of the total world fleet by the end of the Second United Nations&#13;
Development Decade; Governments of States members of UNCTAD should&#13;
invite liner conferences.operating in the national maritime trade&#13;
of developing countries to admit national/or multinational shipping&#13;
lines of the developing countries concerned as full members and also&#13;
consider favourably, fairly and on equal terms applications of the&#13;
national and/or multinational shipping lines of developing countries&#13;
for admission as full members of wayport trades related to these&#13;
countries- own foreign trade subject to the rights and obligations&#13;
of conference membership the objective being that shipping lines&#13;
of developing countries should have an increasing and substantial&#13;
participation in the carriage of cargoes generated by their foreign&#13;
trade;&#13;
Since tankers and bulk carriers constitute the main growth points&#13;
of the world fleet, developing countries may give special attention&#13;
to the establishment, expansion and sound operation of bulk carrier&#13;
and tanker fleets in order to realize their desired level of partic-&#13;
ipation in world shipping and in this task the developed countries&#13;
may consider assisting the developing countries where appropriate&#13;
consistent with paragraph 1 of the present resolution;&#13;
Since, to the extent that traders in developed countries buy on&#13;
f.o.b. terms and sell on c.i.f. terms in trade transactions with&#13;
developing countries, shippers in developed countries are generally&#13;
in a position to nominate the carrier, this situation should not&#13;
prevent developing countries from participating on a fair basis in&#13;
the trade concerned;&#13;
It is being recognized that developing countries should have an&#13;
increasing and substantial participation in the carriage of mari-&#13;
time cargoes, they should be enabled to expand their national and&#13;
multinational merchant marines through the adoption of such measures&#13;
as may be appropriate to permit their shipowners to compete in the&#13;
international freight market and thus contribute to a sound devel-&#13;
opment of shipping;&#13;
Groups of developing countries should examine the feasibility of&#13;
establishing multinational merchant marines, possibly on a regional&#13;
or subregional basis, with a view, inter alia, to securing increasing&#13;
participation.in the carriage of maritime cargoes and in earnings&#13;
therefrom;&#13;

3.   United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3202 (S-VI) of May 1, 1974&#13;
[Official Records: Sixth Special Session Supplement No. 1 CA/19559]&#13;
The General Assembly Adopts the following Program of Action ...&#13;
"4. Transportation and insurance&#13;
All efforts should be made:&#13;
(a) To promote an increasing and equitable participation of&#13;
developing countries in the world shipping tonnage;&#13;
(b) To arrest and reduce the ever-increasing freight rates&#13;
in order to reduce the costs of imports to, and exports&#13;
from, the developing countries"...&#13;
4.   Bangui Charter on Maritime Transport&#13;
The ACP ... Have Decided:&#13;
"..8. to unite their efforts in order to ensure that traffic to and&#13;
from their countries is effected on the most advantageous terms for&#13;
their economies;&#13;
9. to create and develop their merchant fleets;&#13;
10. to coordinate, within each of the three regions, the activities of&#13;
each country's shipping companies to enable them to make optimum use&#13;
of transport capacity through organizing in concern their shipping&#13;
lines and agencies with a view to pooling."&#13;

and Communications Decade in Africa (1978-1988)&#13;
Maritime Transport - Goals and Objectives (E/CN/ECO/138/REV. 1 p. 14]&#13;
"... Encourage the establishment of national/regional and/or subregional&#13;
shipping companies. The setting up of a shipping company with vessels&#13;
and technical and administrative personnel requires very substantial&#13;
investment and presents considerable risks; the viability of such invest-&#13;
ment is closely linked to the management efficiency and guaranteed annual&#13;
tonnage, since below a certain cargo tonnage threshold, the vessels&#13;
generally operate at a loss. This fully justifies pooling of their tech-&#13;
nical facilities in setting up multinational companies which, by carrying&#13;
the quotas of several countries, will result in viable operations...&#13;
During the Decade every effort should be made to discourage investment&#13;
in open registry vessels, and correspondingly to encourage development&#13;
of national regional shipping lines."&#13;

ANNEX 11&#13;
BASIS FOR THE COMPUTATION OF THE SHIPPING CORPORATION OF INDIA'S&#13;
CONTRIBUTION TO INDIA'S BALANCE OF PAYMENTS&#13;
(i) Earnings&#13;
The operating earnings of the Corporation can be broadly categorized&#13;
as under:&#13;
(1) Actual collections in foreign currencies.&#13;
(2) Actual collections from bilateral countries where&#13;
transactions are in rupees.&#13;
(3) Collections in Indian Rupees in respect of overseas&#13;
services.&#13;
(4) Rupee earnings in respect of coastal trade.&#13;
Items (1) and (2) are considered as direct foreign exchange earnings&#13;
and item (3) is treated as indirect foreign exchange saving on the&#13;
assumption that if an Indian Line were not to operate, these freight&#13;
earnings would have been repatriated out of India by foreign shipping&#13;
companies. On this basis, the entire operating earnings with the&#13;
exclusion of coastal trade earnings, have been treated as a foreign&#13;
exchange earning and saving.&#13;
(ii) Expenditure&#13;
All direct or indirect operating expenses and charter hire outgo&#13;
actually incurred/disbursed in foreign currencies as well as payments&#13;
to bilateral countries have been treated as foreign exchange outgo.&#13;
In addition, direct operating expenses incurred in Indian ports,&#13;
excepting on bunker, have been treated as indirect foreign exchange&#13;
outgo on the assumption that, if a foreign shipping line were to&#13;
operate, the freight earnings in Indian ports would have been repa-&#13;
triated out of India only after making disbursements for direct&#13;
operating expenses in Indian ports. As regards bunker, it has been&#13;
assumed that the bunker lifted in Indian ports by foreign operators&#13;
would be insignificant.&#13;
The above basis had been explained earlier to the Ministry of&#13;
Finance, Department of Economic Affairs, and was accepted by them.&#13;

            The purpose of this paper is to consider
            whether and under what circumstances developing countries
            can benefit from investments in international shipping.  In
            recent years, much has been said and written to encourage
            developing countries to invest in national shipping lines to
            carry their foreign trade.  In examining the issue, the
            paper finds no overwhelming evidence either favoring or
            arguing against such investment.  International shipping is
            capital intensive and can be risky and highly competitive.
            Investments are more likely to be beneficial for countries
            with a tradition in shipping and with appropriate
            institutions, for industrial linkages and hence expansion of
            related industries, prospects of substantial net foreign
            exchange savings or earning for shipping activity, and for
            the ability to develop new trading volumes, routes or
            partners by removing service constraints.  The existence and
            strength of these factors must be tested in the context of
            overall economic transport needs and priorities, taking into
            account the possibilities for improving both inland and
            shipping technologies through such investments.
