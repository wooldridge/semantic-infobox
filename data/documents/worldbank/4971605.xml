            Activists are often unhappy with the
            laws governing business behavior and with their enforcement.
            One strategy they use to alter the behavior of corporations
            is to target not the laws but the corporations, hoping that
            they will change without being legally obliged to. Sometimes
            firms do, because they would rather incur the costs of
            behaving better today than the costs of being shamed later.
            But how does this reputational mechanism work? Will it
            achieve the right standards? Which companies will it affect?
            And are there good reasons to prefer it to alternative ways
            of setting standards?
