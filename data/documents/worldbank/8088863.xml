CHALLENGES FOR NEW LEADERSHIP TEAMS IN FRAGILE STATES&#13;
By Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, President of the Republic of Liberia&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Fragile states pose a challenge for good leadership--for renewal and reform. States in the grip of poverty,&#13;
    with broken socioeconomic infrastructure and a political culture of impunity, require courageous leader-&#13;
    ship, one that is unafraid of risks and able to challenge itself to be innovative and look toward the future.&#13;
    In this brief, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, President of the Republic of Liberia, shares lessons learned from her&#13;
    experience in leading a post-conflict country. She emphasizes the importance of taking a broader view of&#13;
    the national leadership system while building national leadership capacities and cautions against adopt-&#13;
    ing a "one size fits all" approach. Drawing from Liberia's recent turnaround, she identifies key capacities&#13;
    that need to be developed. She points out that consciousness of ethics forces the setting of standards and&#13;
    requires leaders to lead by good example, particularly when it comes to demonstrating and imparting&#13;
    honesty, tolerance, participatory democracy, work ethics, and understanding. This brief was adapted&#13;
    from her remarks at the World Bank Institute's Capacity Day 2007, which took place in Washington DC&#13;
    on April 19.&#13;

  Fragile states exist in many forms. Some are newly         reform. Change and transformation in this respect&#13;
emerging from civil conflicts with the attendant             means a break, formulating a vision based upon new&#13;
stresses that are evident in political destabilization       concepts and structures. This requires leadership that&#13;

fragile states lose sustainability or efficacy in their      guides, and leads its people toward a common vision&#13;
political and socioeconomic order and system.                and a common national purpose. A new leadership&#13;

a fragile state and a failed state are semantic, rather          models within a global governance framework that is&#13;

  About the Author&#13;
  Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, President of Liberia&#13;
  The first woman ever elected head of an African state, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf is the president of Liberia. She served in&#13;
  the early 1970s as Liberia's finance minister under President William Tolbert. After Tolbert was deposed and executed,&#13;
  Johnson-Sirleaf left Liberia to avoid detention by his successor, Samuel K. Doe, and spent most of the 1980s in Kenya&#13;
  and the United States as an executive in the international banking community. After ceding the election of 1997, she&#13;
  again left the country to avoid President Taylor's charges of treason. Called the "iron lady" of Liberian politics, "Ma"&#13;
  Johnson-Sirleaf returned to Liberia after Taylor fled to Nigeria in 2003. As the standard-bearer for the Unity Party, she&#13;
  ran again for the presidency in 2005, promising economic development and an end to corruption and civil war and&#13;
  beat George Weah in a runoff election in November 2005. She assumed the presidency the following January. Johnson-&#13;
  Sirleaf studied at the University of Colorado at Boulder and obtained a master's degree from Harvard University.&#13;

   Capacity Day 2007: Leadership Matters&#13;
   Vision, Effectiveness, and Accountability&#13;
&#13;
   The World Bank Institute's Capacity Day 2007, held in Washington D.C. on April 19, explored how the Bank and others&#13;
   can improve support for leadership development. The event featured experts and leading thinkers who came together&#13;
   to debate on the methods of leadership development. Some key messages included:&#13;
&#13;
   · Leadership development is more than training individuals; it encompasses a broader set of changes in institutions,&#13;
     policies, and behaviors.&#13;
   · Programs need to emphasize the need for leaders to collaborate and compete, innovate and learn from experience.&#13;
   · The learning process in leadership development needs to evolve as conditions change.&#13;

Q&amp;A Session from Capacity Day&#13;
Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, President of the Republic of Liberia&#13;
&#13;
Question: What would happen if we do not bolster support for leaders in post conflict states?&#13;
&#13;
Answer: The issue of support is very important for us. If we do not get the support to be able to deliver the&#13;
basic services, particularly the creation of jobs for our very young population, we run the risk of having&#13;
their vulnerabilities exposed and the risk of them once again being recruited into conflict, undermining all&#13;
the progress that we have made.&#13;
&#13;
Question: One of the things that we often don't talk about leadership is the role of gender. Given your&#13;
very unique perspective on this, please share what this means to you and how we can think about&#13;
this differently?&#13;
&#13;
Answer: Let me put it this way, because I am always faced with this question. And my response is always&#13;
that I am a technocrat. I am a professional who happens to be a woman. But that said, as a woman, I bring&#13;
a special sensitivity to the task, a sensitivity that comes from being a mother and in my case a grandmother.&#13;
To be able to be very concerned about the human factor, the needs of children and women in society. I think&#13;
many of those on my leadership team who are women bring the same kind of sensitivity to their responsibil-&#13;
ity. And I think that's why our leadership may perhaps be more effective.&#13;
&#13;
Question: Do you think that in every sense, women are generally better leaders than men?&#13;
&#13;
Answer: I don't know what the empirical evidence will show, but in a qualitative way I will say yes. For&#13;
one thing to start off with, women are more honest. Women are better managers, because they manage the&#13;
home so well, so they are accustomed sometimes in cases of resources constraint to allocate with better effi-&#13;
ciency. Yes, I think women are better leaders. I hope I can prove that it is true.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            In this brief, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf,
            President of the Republic of Liberia, shares lessons learned
            from her experience in leading a post-conflict country. She
            emphasizes the importance of taking a broader view of the
            national leadership system while building national
            leadership capacities and cautions against adopting a one
            size fits all approach. Drawing from Liberia's recent
            turnaround, she identifies key capacities that need to be
            developed. Fragile states pose a challenge for good
            leadership-for renewal and reform. States in the grip of
            poverty with broken socioeconomic infrastructure and a
            political culture of impunity, require courageous
            leadership, one that is unafraid of risks and able to
            challenge itself to be innovative and look toward the
            future.  She points out that consciousness of ethics forces
            the setting of standards and requires leaders to lead by
            good example, particularly when it comes to demonstrating
            and imparting honesty, tolerance, participatory democracy,
            work ethics, and understanding.
