Scaling Up Rural Sanitation is designed as an evidence-based learning project with an explicit&#13;
goal to test and document new approaches, reï¬&#130;ect on challenges, and develop knowledge&#13;
products to share lessons learned. Testing innovative approaches implies taking risks and&#13;
learning from successes and failures. Scaling Up Rural Sanitation would not be possible without&#13;
the support of Water and Sanitation Programâ&#128;&#153;s management team including Jaehyang So,&#13;
Christopher Juan Costain, Wambui Gichuri, and Almud Weitz.&#13;
&#13;
This Working Paper draws on evidence from ï¬?eldwork and knowledge products developed&#13;
to support WSPâ&#128;&#153;s learning objectives. WSP is grateful for the contributions of Barbara Evans,&#13;

     The SaniFOAM framework was developed in Durban, South Africa, in February 2008, at a workshop attended by participants from six organizations including UNICEF, the&#13;
     London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, USAID, and AED/Hygiene Improvement Project. It is based on Population Services Internationalâ&#128;&#153;s PERForM framework.&#13;
21&#13;
     Behavioral determinants can be internal (such as beliefs about feces) or external (such as sanctions for open defecation). A deeper understanding of determinants and how they&#13;
     influence behavior can lead to more effective interventions.&#13;

While a common framework was developed and used across all three countries,                                   efficiencies.&#13;
country-specific indicators were developed to ensure that the indicators were ap-&#13;
propriate for the country. In each country, the enabling environment was peri-&#13;
odically assessed using the indicators and a scoring system. The six indicators&#13;
noted under Institutional Arrangements (see TableÂ 3), for example, were each given&#13;
a score of one. The total score for Institutional Arrangements could thus range&#13;
from 0 to 6, with 6 representing the ideal environment, to ensure that progress&#13;
could be sustained. Scores for each dimension were summed and diagrammed&#13;
(see FigureÂ 5). Although the diagrams (referred to as â&#128;&#156;spiderâ&#128;? diagrams) were not&#13;
a precise tool, they were used to help track changes, compare districts and coun-&#13;
tries, and were useful as district-level planning tools.&#13;
&#13;
The scales for each dimension were initially designed for national-level assess-&#13;
ments; however, the scales were adapted in Indonesia and Tanzania to assess&#13;

     Another issue was access to financing to cover start-up                                       (DWSTs). Next, the resource agencies trained district offi-&#13;

More often than not that responsibility falls on the shoul-                      if demand is created. However, given the range of possible ap-&#13;

&amp;#12;What Does It Take to Scale Up Rural Sanitation?                                  Operationalizing the Programmatic Approach for Service Delivery at Scale&#13;

       â&#128;¢ Helping the local private sector strengthen the supply of affordable sanita-&#13;
         tion products and services; and&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Monitoring household and community sanitation outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
Externally funded technical assistance represented nine percent (US$8Â  mil-&#13;
lion) of total funds invested. Most of these costs fell into (a) one-time upfront&#13;
costs. No external funds were used to fund sanitation facilities, government-&#13;
related labor costs, or ongoing recurrent costs to sustain implementation.&#13;
Examples of costs covered by external sources included:&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;¢                      Conducting formative market research;&#13;
       â&#128;¢                      Developing marketing messages and communication/ promotion materials;&#13;
       â&#128;¢                      Conducting training and capacity building activities for local government;&#13;
       â&#128;¢                      Production of resource materials and mass media campaigns;&#13;
       â&#128;¢                      Collecting monitoring data;&#13;
       â&#128;¢                      Direct technical assistance;&#13;
       â&#128;¢                      Advocacy efforts to support policy reform; and&#13;
       â&#128;¢                      Capturing and disseminating knowledge.&#13;
&#13;
Investment from households represented 55 percent (US$50 million) of total&#13;
funds invested. These investments fell into (b) onsite household sanitation facility&#13;
costs. In Tanzania and Indonesia, households financed the entire cost of a house-&#13;
hold latrine. In Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, India, above the poverty&#13;
the line (APL) households financed the entire cost from their own sources, while&#13;
some households below the poverty line (BPL) added their own resources to a&#13;
government subsidy to build a higher quality latrine (see Figure 9).33&#13;

&#13;
â&#128;¢ What programmatic and institutional conditions comprise the enabling envi-&#13;
  ronment needed to scale up and sustain large-scale sanitation programs?&#13;
&#13;
Country-level interventions were designed to test and learn about these questions and&#13;
sub-questions. The goal of the learning component was not to learn per se, but to use&#13;
or leverage evidenced-based knowledge to inform government and donor policies and&#13;
practices, increase investments in sanitation, and ensure that these investments are&#13;
effective in reaching the poor.&#13;

Lesson #1: Well-targeted subsidies can be effective in reaching poor people.                                                  Lesson #1: Well-targeted subsidies can&#13;
Public investments of varying forms, including subsidies, can and have helped                                                 be effective in reaching poor people.&#13;
trigger significant increases in access to household sanitation. Country field ex-&#13;
periences supported by evidence-based research found that well-designed, afford-&#13;
able, and sustainable subsidy programs undertaken by the country government&#13;
do help the poor gain access to improved sanitation. The more cost-effective&#13;
approach to using hardware-related subsidies was an outcome-based approach,&#13;
in which the government rewards communities that become ODF by providing&#13;
financial subsidies for improved household sanitation facilities. When resources&#13;
are scarce, public dollars give the biggest â&#128;&#156;bang for the buckâ&#128;? when theyâ&#128;&#153;re used&#13;
to finance demand-creation activities such as CLTS and BCC.&#13;
&#13;
Key points related to subsidies include:&#13;
        â&#128;¢ Partial public funding for hardware can significantly increase access to&#13;
          household sanitation.&#13;

reward programs in India has some important lessons, not just for the Indian&#13;
context but also for replication elsewhere.&#13;
&#13;
Key points related to incentives and verification include:&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Programs need to plan for scale. The number of applications for the na-&#13;
         tional award program in India, for example, increased from fewer than 500&#13;
         to almost 10,000 in the third year. For state reward programs, in Himachal&#13;
         Pradesh, for example, the number of districts participating increased from&#13;
         just one in the first year to all 12 by the third year. To organize the verifica-&#13;
         tion process in a transparent and accountable manner, it is important to&#13;
         anticipate this scaling up and plan accordingly.&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Verification teams should receive training. This can include a mix of classroom&#13;
         sessions to ensure conceptual clarity and field practice on how to complete the&#13;
         verification forms. A well-developed verification instrument is a prerequisite&#13;
         for ensuring quality in the verification process. In addition to the technical pa-&#13;
         rameters, training should cover the behavior and attitude of verification team&#13;
         members during the verification.&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Multi-level verification and the presence of a multi-stakeholder team en-&#13;
         sure that the verification process retains its objectivity and adherence to&#13;
         the basic principles. In both the national and state reward programs in&#13;
         India, there were multiple levels of verification, with multiple teams at&#13;
         each level (national) or a multi-stakeholder team (state reward programs),&#13;
         which ensured that bias was reduced. Peer monitoring, such as using heads&#13;

Lesson #7: Changing social norms around open defecation and latrine use                                                 Lesson #7: Changing social norms&#13;

100 percent sanitized or ODF. The research showed that latrine use had been the&#13;
norm mostly among upper-income groups or in areas covered by earlier sanita-&#13;
tion campaigns. However, after an extensive national sanitation campaign carried&#13;
out between 2003â&#128;&#147;2006, latrine use in these ODF areas is currently a socially&#13;
accepted practice at all levels of society, including the poorest wealth quintile,&#13;
and those who continue to practice open defecation are socially criticized. Mar-&#13;
riage arrangements, village respectability, and village purity for religious events&#13;
are widely assumed to require use of â&#128;&#156;hygienic/health-enhancingâ&#128;? latrines. One&#13;
plausible contributor to this shift in social norms in Bangladesh is that the BCC&#13;
campaign directed at households was fairly pervasive: campaign messages were&#13;
communicated through various channels and settings, including messaging by&#13;
Union Parishad members or officers at meetings, rallies, over loudspeaker an-&#13;
nouncements, and through household visits by Union Parishad members or&#13;
NGO workers.45&#13;

munities triggered using the CLTS approach, more than 700,000 people had&#13;
gained access to improved sanitation and 35 percent of triggered communities&#13;
had become ODF. But the percentage becoming ODF in different districts varied&#13;
widely between 10 and 95 percent. In 2010, action research was conducted in&#13;
80 East Java communities to try to better understand why this was happening.&#13;
&#13;
Key findings include:&#13;
       â&#128;¢ Communities reaching ODF status within two months of triggering&#13;
         achieved markedly higher access gains and sustained ODF behaviors better&#13;
         than communities that took many months to become ODF.&#13;

&amp;#12;V.                 Conclusion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Much has been learned over the past five years on how to design and implement&#13;
large-scale sustainable rural sanitation programs; how to promote systematic policy&#13;
and institutional reform; how to strengthen stakeholdersâ&#128;&#153; support for at-scale service&#13;
delivery; and how to develop and support affordable financing strategies that are&#13;
effective in reaching the poor. These learnings are being developed into knowledge&#13;
products and tools, and shared with government clients and development partners&#13;
to increase investment, enhance technical support, and facilitate replication.&#13;
&#13;

Although progress has been made, much work remains, including learning how best&#13;
to support governments to grow large-scale programs into nation-wide programs,           political will into practice.&#13;
and how to strengthen partnerships with other development agencies, donors, and&#13;
international financing institutions. Some (but not all) of the key next-generation&#13;
learning questions include:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢ What are effective approaches to go from large-scale programs to national-&#13;
     level programs?&#13;
   â&#128;¢ How can the local private sector in isolated rural areas be transformed into&#13;
     a more robust sanitation market to keep up with the demand for improved&#13;
     sanitation by households?&#13;
   â&#128;¢ What institutional support is needed to sustain behavior change at the&#13;
     household and community levels over time?&#13;
   â&#128;¢ How can governments be more effectively motivated and supported to&#13;
     develop and own national-level sanitation monitoring and evaluation sys-&#13;
     tems that they use for effective performance monitoring, real-time learn-&#13;
     ing, and improvement of at-scale rural sanitation programs?&#13;
   â&#128;¢ How can financing be made more accessible to the local private sector as&#13;
     well as to households?&#13;
   â&#128;¢ How can large-scale capacity building of local governments and the local&#13;
     private sector be institutionalized and sustained over time?&#13;
&#13;
With more than 2.5 billion people without safe sanitation, there is still much to&#13;
learn and to improve. We welcome your comments and ideas.&#13;

            What does it take to scale up rural sanitation?
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Over the last 30 years, most rural
            sanitation projects have had pockets of success, but were
            small in scale and could not be scaled up. Learning how to
            expand on the successes of small-scale projects to increase
            access at large scale has been an enduring challenge.
            Project outcomes often fail the sustainability test once
            external funding ceases, and the benefits, even if
            sustained, remain limited to project areas. Despite growing
            political will to do more about rural sanitation, the lack
            of evidence and examples of effective and sustainable
            large-scale rural sanitation programs has constrained
            governments and development partners. In an attempt to help
            address these issues, starting in 2007, the World
            Bank's Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) provided
            technical assistance to help governments design, plan,
            implement, and monitor national rural sanitation programs
            that start at scale and are sustainable. This initiative was
            carried out in three countries, India, Indonesia, and
            Tanzania. To increase the supply of sanitation products and
            services, efforts were made to build the capacity of local
            builders, manufacturers, and suppliers of sanitation
            products and services. In addition, in all three countries,
            national governments have developed, reformed, or improved
            national sanitation policies to become demand-responsive,
            and local governments have strengthened their capacity to
            facilitate community-led efforts to stop open defecation and
            to support the local private sector to build improved
            sanitation facilities.
