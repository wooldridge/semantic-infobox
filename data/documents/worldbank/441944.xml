I. COUNTRY BACKGROUND AND THE 1998 FLOODS&#13;
A.    Bangladesh: A Land of Rivers&#13;
1.1    Bangladesh is a land of rivers. The intricate network of over 200 large and small rivers&#13;
annually discharges some 175 billion cubic meters of water and about 2.4 billion tons of sediment&#13;
into the Bay of Bengal. The country also receives between 1,000 to 5,000 mm of rain annually,&#13;
about 80 percent during the monsoon season between June and September.&#13;
1.2    Massive rainfall and peak season flows through the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna river&#13;
system cause seasonal flooding in Bangladesh, particularly when the two phenomena peak&#13;
together. The crops vulnerable to flood damage are aus rice (harvested in June-July), aman rice&#13;
(about 50 percent of total rice production, and harvested in November-December), boro rice&#13;
(harvested in March-April), jute, sugarcane, and summer vegetables. In an average year, 35&#13;
percent of the net cultivated area is subjected to shallow flooding (30-90 cm), 16 percent to&#13;
moderate flooding (90-180 cm), and 12 percent to deep flooding (more than 180 cm). The people&#13;
and economy of Bangladesh have adapted over generations to this type of flooding. However,&#13;
when flood intensity sharply exceeds these averages, as has recently happened every 10- 15 years,&#13;
there is enormous loss of life, livelihoods, property, and crops.&#13;
1.3   Both before and after its independence, Bangladesh has made various, partial attempts to&#13;
manage its vast water resources. Bangladesh most recently suffered from major flooding in 1954,&#13;
1955, 1974, 1987, and 1988. The 1988 floods were short-lived but catastrophic because of the&#13;
rapidity with which the flood waters rose. The 1987 and 1988 floods led Bangladesh, with&#13;
assistance from bilateral and multilateral donors, to undertake more than 20 joint studies on flood&#13;
mitigation and control, now collectively known as the Flood Action Plan (FAP)! The main&#13;
components of the FAP included several regional and urban planning studies, project-specific&#13;
studies, and special programs on flood forecasting, early warning, and flood preparedness.&#13;
Implementation of some of the FAP projects started in 1990 to minimise damage to agricultural&#13;
production through better .management of flood waters, and to meet some of the needs for&#13;
fisheries, navigation, and public health. The FAP analyses and projects have attracted their share&#13;
of criticism, in particular relating to the technical solutions proposed, the co-ordination of&#13;
different components, the early focus on flood control alone (later broadened to integrate water&#13;
management), the lack of local participation, and the extent and nature of dissemination. In spite&#13;
of their shortcomings, the FAP studies and projects have been useful in stressing the importance,&#13;
when dealing with floods, of the complete hydrological cycle and of developing an integrated&#13;
management plan that covers not only flooding but also drainage, irrigation, navigation, the&#13;
environment, socio-economic factors, and the importance of beneficiary participation at all stages&#13;
of project development. At the conclusion of the FAP, the government produced its first Water&#13;
and Flood Management Strategy (September 1995), out of which has grown the National Water&#13;
Policy and the National Water Management Plan, under preparation with assistance from IDA. It&#13;
will be important to assess prior work on flood mitigation done under the FAP and the subsequent&#13;
development of water management in Bangladesh once the full impact of the 1998 floods&#13;
becomes clearer.&#13;

Water Plan, Report No. 17663-BD, March 15, 1998, The World Bank.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
B.    The 1998 Floods&#13;
1.4   The unprecedented flooding in 1998, the worst in living memory, is linked to the three&#13;
main rivers-the Ganges, the Brahmaputra and the Meghna. Flows from the first two come from&#13;
snowmelt in the Himalayas and rainfall, while the Meghna is primarily a rain-fed river. Each of&#13;
these rivers usually peaks at different times of the year. However, when the peaks synchronise, as&#13;
they did in 1988 and again in 1998, there is major flooding as several flood waves pass through&#13;
the country. Unlike 1988, the 1998 floods were not only severe but also persisted for five times as&#13;
long. The flood situation started to deteriorate in the middle of July 1998 due to heavy rainfall in&#13;
the entire catchment area of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna system. Precipitation was 40&#13;
percent higher than normal in July, and 35 per cent higher in August. In addition, above normal&#13;
snowfall in the Himalayas followed by a warm July substantially increased snowmelt. As a&#13;
result, the Brahmaputra peaked thrice during July and August, and remained well above danger&#13;
levels until the third week of September. The Ganges peaked in early August, matching the last&#13;
flood wave through the Brahmaputra. The Meghna crossed the danger level in mid-July and&#13;
remained there until the third week of September. Finally, sea levels in the Bay of Bengal were&#13;
apparently higher during this period, further inhibiting drainage from the delta. The confluence of&#13;
these events appears to have resulted in the unprecedented 1998 floods.&#13;
C.    International Response to the 1998 Floods&#13;
1.5   The international community's response to the floods has been swift. The Government&#13;
issued an international appeal on August 26, 1998 requesting US$113 million for immediate&#13;
relief and US$461 million for rehabilitation, including approximately US$250 million in&#13;
additional food aid. The Government also requested emergency assistance from the Bank and the&#13;
IMF.&#13;
1.6   In response to Government's appeal, the United Nations immediately fielded a damage&#13;
assessment mission, led by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, and issued a&#13;
flash appeal for support. A technical working group on food requirements was established by the&#13;
World Food Program (WFP). As an immediate response to the Government's request, the United&#13;
Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, United Nations Development Program, World&#13;
Health Organization, WFP, and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reprogrammed&#13;
their activities and obtained fresh commitments, enabling them to provide emergency supplies of&#13;
medicines and other relief items. From the Local Consultative Group of donors in Dhaka, sub-&#13;
groups on infrastructure, health, education, agriculture, water supply, and sanitation convened&#13;
emergency meetings to co-ordinate their activities. By the end of September some US$145&#13;
million had been pledged by the international community in cash, kind, and food aid. An&#13;
agreement with the IMF has been reached that will allow Bangladesh to access 25 percent of its&#13;
quota, or approximately US$135 million, under the IMF's Emergency Finance Facility. The&#13;
Asian Development Bank is planning a new, multi-sector Flood Rehabilitation Assistance Project&#13;
that is expected to provide US$103 million, in addition to reprogramming some of its existing&#13;
projects.&#13;
Il. THE MACROECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE FLOODS&#13;
2.1    While it is too early to estimate the full macroeconomic impact of the floods, it is clear&#13;
that the severe intensity and long duration of the floods will impact the economy substantially.&#13;

and  shipments of ready-made  ga1 M ents (Bangladesh's dominant export item), and  severed&#13;
crucial infrastructure links.  Rehabilitating this productive capacity will take time. Preliminary&#13;
assessments suggest that GDP growth in 1998/99 could decline to about 3.3 percent from the 5.6&#13;
percent achieved in 1997/98, led by the decline in agricultural growth (Chart L.A).&#13;
2.3       Crop damage has been significant. The floods damaged the standing aus rice crop and&#13;
prevented the planting of aman rice in large parts of the country. The pre-flood target for food-&#13;
grain production in 1998/99 was 21 million metric tons (MMT, Table 1), with an availability of&#13;
about 19 MMT after deducting normal wastage of about 10 percent. With total food grain demand&#13;
estimated at approximately 21 MMT (16 ounces per person per day for a population of 127&#13;
million) the pre-flood food grain gap was estimated at about 2.2 MMT. This gap is usually met by&#13;
a mix of private and public sector imports of food grain. The Ministry of Food estimates that&#13;
compared to the pre-flood target there will be a shortfall of about 0.3 MMT in theaus rice harvest&#13;
and a shortfall of about 2.1 MMT in the aman rice harvest.&#13;

Government needs to be mindful of not&#13;
creating an oversupply situation that would depress food grain prices and erode farmer incentives.&#13;
Accordingly, the Government expects to import anywhere from 1 MMT to 2.2 MMT based on&#13;
the aman and boro crop outcomes and private sector imports.&#13;

were inundated, equipment damaged, and workers unable to travel to work. Most road and rail&#13;
links were cut off, including on the critical Dhaka-Chittagong corridor, making the shipment of&#13;
goods difficult and expensive. While the garments sector has been resilient in the past, and can be&#13;
expected to make up for some of the production time lost during the first quarter of 1998/99, it&#13;
will be difficult to recover quickly and fully because of the loss of production capacity due to&#13;
equipment damage. Accordingly, the 1998/99 growth rate for the garments sector has been&#13;
revised downward from a pre-flood estimate of 13 percent to 10 percent per annum. The floods&#13;
have also adversely affected jute, leather and frozen foods exports. As a result, it is estimated that&#13;
total exports will only grow by about 4.8 percent in US dollar terms, compared with over 15&#13;
percent growth in the previous two years.&#13;

2.7      Without additional external assistance, the  balance  of payments  would  worsen&#13;
considerably. Without appropriate macroeconomic measures, preliminary estimates of the impact&#13;
of the floods on the balance of payments indicate that the current account deficit would increase&#13;
from 1.5 percent of GDP in 1997/98 to 3.2 percent of GDP in 1998/99 (Table 3). This would put&#13;
considerable pressure on foreign exchange reserves, which have declined from the mid-1990s&#13;
(Chart J.E) and covered only 2.5 months of imports prior to the floods, not adequate for a country&#13;
prone to exogenous shocks such as Bangladesh. A reduced export growth rate and additional&#13;
flood-related imports would increase the external financing gap to about US$803 million, after&#13;
taking into account increases in compassionate remittances from expatriate Bangladeshis. The&#13;
external trade outlook is complicated by a real appreciation of the taka over the past two years&#13;
and the resulting loss of some competitiveness (Chart J.F). The forecasted balance of payments&#13;
outcome with the Government's macroeconomic measures and flood-related emergency&#13;
assistance is discussed in paragraphs 2.10 to 2.12.&#13;

C. Impact on the Budget&#13;
2.8     Lower revenues  due  to  slower economic  growth  and  additional flood-related&#13;
expenditures will put pressure on the budget Without additional revenue measures, slower GDP&#13;
growth will slow  down revenue growth. There is also likely to be a slow-down in public&#13;
expenditures as a result of the flood-related disruption, but this is more than likely to be balanced&#13;
by additional current and development expenditures related to flood rehabilitation.   Without&#13;
macroeconomic adjustment measures and based on the 1998/99 Budget, the combination of the&#13;
pressure from lower revenues and higher expenditures would result in an overall budget deficit of&#13;
5.9 percent of GDP, relative to the 4.2 percent achieved in 1997/98. Domestic financing of the&#13;
budget deficit would rise substantially.  Table 4 shows the impact of the floods without&#13;
adjustment measures, relative to actual 1997/98 outcomes and the 1998/99 pre-flood, Budget&#13;
estimates.&#13;

D. Emergency Assistance and the Government's Adjustment Measures&#13;
2.9     Emergency Assistance: In parallel with the proposed IDA support for financing critical&#13;
imports, the Government has successfully negotiated an agreement with the IMF for emergency&#13;
balance of payments assistance (up to the ceiling of 25 percent of quota, SDR 98.1 million,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
US$135 million equivalent). The IMF's emergency assistance will support the Government's&#13;
adjustment measures designed to maintain macroeconomic stability in the face of the 1998 floods.&#13;
2.10    Adjustment Measures: The Government has undertaken a series of macroeconomic&#13;
steps designed to reduce pressure on the balance of payments and the overall budget deficit. The&#13;
taka was devalued on October 18, 1998 by 2.97 percent. The Government has also announced a&#13;
set of tax measures aimed at raising an additional Tk 3 billion in revenues. These include a&#13;
temporary 4 percent surcharge on existing supplementary duties on luxury items; a surcharge on&#13;
telephone, fax, telex and email fees; a surcharge on income from savings certificates and fixed&#13;
deposits at banks and other financial institutions; and a tax on passport renewals and issuance.&#13;
2.11   The Government is also exploring ways to conserve resources from  the Annual&#13;
Development Program (ADP) and to redirect expenditures towards the repair of damaged&#13;
infrastructure. Project-related expenditures totaling Tk 6 billion have been identified for&#13;
reallocation, and further such reallocations are expected. The Government has also indicated that&#13;
it will identify low-priority projects that can be delayed or dropped from the ADP. Furthermore,&#13;
past experience shows that actual ADP implementation is well below the budgeted ADP target,&#13;
and this is even more likely to be the case with pervasive flooding during the first quarter of&#13;
1998/99. Assuming that the Government will significantly reallocate ADP funds to finance non-&#13;
food, flood-related imports and pay for a part of the repairs to infrastructure, this first set of fiscal&#13;
adjustments would result in an ADP of Tk 129 billion, which would be Tk 5 billion short of the&#13;
1998/99 pre-flood, Budget target. This would nonetheless still represent a 14 percent nominal&#13;
increase over the 1997/98 outcome of Tk 113 billion.&#13;
2.12   The Government expects to close the post-adjustment financing gap of about US$530&#13;
million on the balance of payments with additional assistance (Table 3). The post-adjustment&#13;
forecast suggests that the current account deficit would rise to 2.9 percent of GDP from the 1.5&#13;
percent 1997/98 outcome, with the level of foreign exchange reserves held steady at US$1.7&#13;
billion (or about 2.2 months of a higher import bill as compared to 1997/98). The Government&#13;
also expects that with these adjustment measures the budget deficit would be 4.7 percent of GDP&#13;
in 1998/99 (see also Chart 1.C), a smaller increase from the 1997/98 outcome of 4.2 percent than&#13;
otherwise anticipated. Foreign financing as a percentage of GDP would rise relative to domestic&#13;
financing in 1998/99 as compared to the previous year, with domestic financing held flat as a&#13;
percentage of GDP (Chart 1.D). It will be important to ensure that any residual fiscal gap is not&#13;
financed through increased borrowing from the banking system, since this would crowd out&#13;
private sector activities and undermine monetary stability.&#13;
III. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
A.    Project Strategy and Context&#13;
3.1    The proposed Emergency Flood Recovery Project is consistent with the core importance&#13;
of maintaining macroeconomic stability for the Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy for&#13;
Bangladesh. The proposed Project represents the first part of the three-part strategy the Bank has&#13;
adopted to assist Bangladesh in responding to the floods. The strategy covers (1) emergency&#13;
recovery assistance needed to finance imports; (2) reprogramming existing IDA projects and&#13;
supplementing them as necessary to provide rapid and flexible assistance for the rehabilitation of&#13;
physical infrastructure damaged by the floods; and (3) longer-term strengthening of institutional&#13;
capacity for disaster preparedness and management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
B.    Project Objectives&#13;
3.2    The proposed Emergency Flood Recovery Project would assist Bangladesh in&#13;
maintaining macroeconomic stability by financing critical imports of food grains, edible oil,&#13;
fertilizer, seeds, agricultural equipment and inputs, cement and other construction materials,&#13;
industrial machinery, spare parts and raw materials, and fuel. The project has been prepared in&#13;
close consultation with the Ministry of Finance, which would be the executing agency. In keeping&#13;
with the project's emergency nature, it is envisaged that the project would start in November&#13;
1 998 and would be completed by December 31, 1999, closing within six months thereafter.&#13;
C.    Project Components&#13;
3.3    The proposed Emergency Flood Recovery Project would provide quick-disbursing&#13;
support to finance imports on a positive list of items (Attachment 1). The project would, inter&#13;
alia, assist:&#13;
(i) farmers to obtain adequate supplies of seeds, fertilizers, agricultural equipment and&#13;
other inputs so as to be able to plant the next boro rice crop. Concerted efforts are necessary to&#13;
ensure that the forthcoming wheat and boro harvests will be good;&#13;
(ii) the import of additional food grains in order to maintain and augment national food&#13;
grain stocks, which would otherwise be depleted with the partial loss of major rice crops, and&#13;
could have severe inflationary consequences and negatively impact the health, nutrition, and&#13;
morbidity status of the poor, particularly women and children. Edible oil imports would also&#13;
assisted to ensure adequate stocks and price stability;&#13;
(iii) manufacturers to import machinery, spare parts and other industrial raw materials. In&#13;
particular, it will be critical to ensure that the ready-made garments industry, accounting for more&#13;
than 60 percent of Bangladesh's exports, is able to rehabilitate its machinery and equipment and&#13;
make up for lost time; and&#13;
(iv) the import of cement and other construction materials and of fuel and petroleum&#13;
products to rehabilitate assets and restore economic activity while mitigating pressure on the&#13;
balance of payments.&#13;
3.4    The US$200 million size of the proposed Emergency Flood Recovery Project is based on&#13;
the Government's request for emergency assistance, on an assessment of the adverse impact of&#13;
the floods, and on the expected aid from other sources. Without additional bilateral and&#13;
multilateral aid, the foreign financing gap due to lower exports and higher imports would be&#13;
expected to reach about US$530 million (Table 3). The Government expects to cover this gap&#13;
with disbursements from the proposed Credit, the IMF's emergency assistance, assistance from&#13;
the ADB, and food and commodity aid commitments made by other multilateral and bilateral&#13;
donors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.    Project Organization and Management&#13;
4.1    The Ministry of Finance would implement the proposed Project in close collaboration&#13;
with Bangladesh Bank. The Ministry of Finance would open a US dollar Special Account in&#13;
Bangladesh Bank for the Credit, which would finance 100 percent of the foreign exchange costs&#13;
of imports on the positive list agreed with the Government. Bangladesh Bank would provide&#13;
quarterly and annual audit reports prepared by a private, independent auditor to monitor the&#13;
transparency and efficient operation of the Project.&#13;
B.    Implementation Arrangements&#13;
4.2   In keeping with the emergency nature of this proposed assistance, implementation&#13;
arnangements have been kept simple. To ensure due diligence and sound governance in the use of&#13;
IDA funds, the arrangements would also seek to:&#13;
*  ensure that credit proceeds are managed responsibly and only used to finance imports of&#13;
items contained in the positive list;&#13;
.  ensure proper procedures, such as on procurement and accounting, and the complete&#13;
documentation of transactions;&#13;
*  provide frequent management information using suitable monitoring and audit tools.&#13;
4.3    Bangladesh Bank would release foreign exchange for public sector imports after&#13;
satisfying itself that the import transaction is eligible, i.e. (i) the item is on the positive list, and&#13;
(ii) stipulated procurement procedures have been followed. Bangladesh Bank would release&#13;
foreign exchange for private sector imports to commercial banks subject to similar eligibility&#13;
criteria. All releases of foreign exchange to a commercial bank for private sector imports would&#13;
be made against equivalent taka deposits by the commercial bank into the Government's&#13;
counterpart fund account.&#13;
C.    Procurement&#13;
4.4    A positive list of items for import financing has been agreed with the Government&#13;
(Attachment 1). Procurement would be limited to goods from countries that are eligible under the&#13;
Bank's Procurement Guidelines (Guidelines. Procurement under IBRD Loan and IDA Credits of&#13;
January 1995, revised January and August 1996, and revised September 1997) and are also&#13;
participating countries under current IDA guidelines. No more than 50 percent of the Credit&#13;
would be used in the aggregate for the import of any single item on the positive list. Public sector&#13;
import contracts of less than US$50,000, and private sector import contracts of less than&#13;
US$20,000 would not be eligible for financing under the Credit to avoid excessive overhead&#13;
costs.&#13;
4.5    Commodities, such as food grains, fertilizer, and fuel, may be procured under the Project&#13;
by both the public and private sectors through established international commodity markets, or&#13;
through simplified procurement procedures in accordance with the Bank's Procurement&#13;
Guidelines (Table 5). All contracts of US$5 million and above would be subject to the Bank's&#13;
standard prior review procedures. All contracts below US$5 million would be subject to a post&#13;
review by the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
4.6     Goods other than commodities procured by the public sector under this Project would&#13;
follow simplified international competitive bidding, in accordance with the Bank'sProcurement&#13;
Guidelines (Clauses 2.63 and 2.64). However, to facilitate the speedy import of items required&#13;
immediately for the recovery effort, public sector agencies would be able to use international&#13;
shopping procedures, in accordance with Clauses 3.5 and 3.6 of the Bank's Procurement&#13;
Guidelines, for contracts of value less than US$3 million up to March 31, 1999. After this date,&#13;
international shopping would be allowed only for import contracts valued at less than US$1&#13;

US$50,000&#13;
Private Sector Procurement:&#13;
Commodities                                      Through established intemational commodity markets, or&#13;
other channels of competitive procurement as defined in&#13;
Clause 2.65 of the Bank's Procurement Guidelines&#13;

4.7     Goods other than commodities with a contract value of less than US$5 million under this&#13;
Project would be procured by the private sector through established commercial practices, and&#13;
for contracts of value US$5 million or more through simplified international competitive bidding&#13;
procedures.&#13;
D.      Disbursement&#13;
4.8     The Special Account to be established at Bangladesh Bank would have an authorized&#13;
allocation of US$50 million. Disbursements would be made into the Special Account on the basis&#13;
of fully documented withdrawal applications prepared by Bangladesh Bank. For contracts costing&#13;
less than or equal to US$5 million, disbursements may be made on the basis of statements of&#13;
expenditures. All supporting documents related to withdrawals on the basis of statements of&#13;
expenditures would be retained by Bangladesh Bank for verification. This Credit is expected to&#13;
disburse in about a year. The completion date would therefore be December 31, 1999, with six&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
months thereafter for the finalization of accounts and submission of final withdrawal applications&#13;
and other reports.&#13;
4.9    To facilitate the financing of items on the positive list that have already been imported as&#13;
a result of the emergency, the Project would allow retroactive financing up to a ceiling of 20&#13;
percent of the Credit proceeds, or US$40 million. This would apply to eligible imports for which&#13;
payments were made after July 12, 1998, the date of the onset of the floods.&#13;
E.    Accounts, Audits, and Internal Controls&#13;
4.10    Bangladesh Bank would provide adequate staff for managing the Project and&#13;
maintaining proper accounts and records. The financial records should be kept in accordance with&#13;
generally accepted accounting principles and practices. Prior to project start-up, Bangladesh&#13;
Bank, with assistance from the Bank's financial management and procurement staff in Dhaka,&#13;
would establish a suitable financial management system in compliance with the Bank's&#13;
Operational Policy 10.02 on financial management. The system should facilitate the timely&#13;
preparation and submission of accounts and provide reliable accounting data for managing and&#13;
monitoring the project. Due to the short implementation period of about one year,in addition to&#13;
the standard fiscal year-end audits by an independent, external auditor, the use of credit funds&#13;
would be audited also on a quarterly basis. As a condition of effectiveness, Bangladesh Bank&#13;
would appoint a qualified private firm as the independent auditor to conduct these audits on terms&#13;
and conditions acceptable to the Bank. Internal controls for the Project would include the proper&#13;
segregation of functional and financial responsibilities for approving the use of project funds.&#13;
F.    Reporting and Monitoring&#13;
4.11   To facilitate the quarterly and annual reviews, Bangladesh Bank would maintain all&#13;
documentation with respect to the Credit and its disbursement. It would also be responsible for&#13;
submitting quarterly reports to the Bank, via the Finance Ministry, that would cover: (a)&#13;
Summary of Sources and Uses of Funds; (b) Procurement Management Report, and (c) the&#13;
Quarterly Audit Report prepared by the independent auditor. Specific assistance, if required,&#13;
would be made available from the Bank's Dhaka Office, which would maintain close liaison with&#13;
Bangladesh Bank on all implementation matters.&#13;
4.12   Bank staff would monitor credit implementation and its macroeconomic impact in terms&#13;
of indicators for the balance of payments, and other standard macroeconomic variables&#13;
(Attachment 2). A post-completion review would focus on the value added of the Project in terms&#13;
of sustaining macroeconomic stability and the continued achievement of project objectives.&#13;

MONITORING INDICATORS&#13;
The objective of the Emergency Flood Recovery Project is to assist the Government of&#13;
Bangladesh to finance critical imports while maintaining macroeconomic stability. The following&#13;
indicators would be used to monitor macroeconomic stability:&#13;
(i) the balance of payments current account deficit: expected not to exceed 3 percent of GDP&#13;
in 1998/99;&#13;
(ii) the level of foreign exchange reserves: expected not to fall below US$1.7 billion in 1998/99;&#13;
(iii) the overall fiscal deficit for central government operations: expected to remain below 5&#13;
percent of GDP in 1998/99.&#13;
Similar outcomes that maintain macroeconomic stability would be expected for&#13;
1999/2000 and beyond.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Emergency Flood Recovery Project
            will assist the Government in maintaining macroeconomic
            stability while helping to finance import costs associated
            with restoring infrastructure assets, production levels, and
            food grain stocks. This is the first part of International
            Development Association's three-part strategy to help
            Bangladesh respond to the 1998 floods. The project will
            provide assistance for: 1) the agricultural sector, to
            ensure that farmers have adequate supplies of seeds,
            fertilizers, and other agricultural inputs for planing the
            next boro rice crops; 2) additional food grain imports in
            order to maintain and augment food grain stocks that will
            otherwise be depleted with the partial loss of two rice
            crops; 3) the manufacturing sector, in order to enable
            manufacturers to import machinery, spare parts, and other
            raw materials; and 4) additional imports of fuel, cement,
            and other construction materials that are needed for relief
            operations and rehabilitation of physical infrastructure.
