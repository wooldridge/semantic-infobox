I.     BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS&#13;
THE CONFLICT AND TRANSITION TO PEACE&#13;
1.    Afghanistan is one of the poorest and longest-suffering countries among the members of the&#13;
World Bank. An estimated 7 million people remain vulnerable to hunger and very large numbers are&#13;
dependent on a massive inflow of food and humanitarian aid. Afghanistan's infrastructure has been&#13;
destroyed or degraded; its human resource base severely depleted; and its social capital eroded. State&#13;
institutions are largely nonfunctional, and the economy and society have become increasingly fragmented.&#13;
2.     September 11, 2001 precipitated wholesale changes in the political and military situation in&#13;
Afghanistan, transforming the overall context for national reconstruction and for World Bank support to&#13;
Afghanistan. The collapse of the Taliban regime was followed by the conclusion on December 5, 2001, in&#13;
Bonn, Germany, of the Agreement on Provisional Arrangements in Afghanistan Pending the Re-&#13;
establishment of Permanent Government Institutions (the Bonn Agreement), an agreement among the&#13;
different groups in opposition to the Taliban regime on a new structure of government and a process that&#13;
would lead to the election of a fully representative government within a period of about 2 and Y2 years.&#13;
3.     Fully vested with the sovereign functions of government, the Afghanistan Interim Authority, of&#13;
which the AIA is a part, peacefully took over central administration on December 22, 2001, with the&#13;
expectation that it would be in power for 6 months. An emergency Loya Jirga will take place in June&#13;
2002. The Loya Jirga will decide on a Transitional Authority that is expected to pave the way for a new&#13;
constitution and an elected, fully representative government for Afghanistan within 2 years. The Interim&#13;
Authority has the power to repeal and amend laws and regulations by decree.&#13;
RURAL POVERTY AND UNEMPLOYMENT&#13;
4.     For about 80 percent of Afghanistan's population, which lives in rural areas, incomes are at&#13;
subsistence level due to high pressure on cultivable land. About 75 percent of Afghanistan's area is&#13;
uninhabitable, (highly mountainous or desert); 14 percent is suitable for agriculture, and only 4 percent is&#13;
cultivated in any given year (some areas remain fallow while others are used for pasture). Part of this&#13;
arable land is in narrow mountain valleys and the rest is in flat lowlands, mostly in the country's north&#13;
and west regions. Water is a limiting factor, so much so that villages are sometimes defined as those&#13;
households sharing a water source. Settlements tend to expand linearly along rivers and along drainage&#13;
basins that rise into foothills, occasionally on terraced slopes that lead to high-plateau villages. A few&#13;
settlements benefit from larger irrigation schemes in lower areas. A rural population estimated at about 20&#13;
million persons (no census has been undertaken for more than a decade) and a total land area of about&#13;
650,000 square kIn, results in a density of about two persons per hectare of arable agricultural land.&#13;
5.     The drought that has lasted since 1999 has further reduced the already low rural incomes and&#13;
depleted assets. After losing land, houses, orchards, cattle, and family members, many Afghans have&#13;
effectively lost their means of livelihood and depend on food aid support, have migrated, or rely on&#13;
remittances. Malnutrition and mortality rates appear to have risen sharply. An estimated 3 million&#13;
persons are vulnerable to hunger and life expectancy is said to have decreased to only 41 years. Many&#13;
families are effectively below subsistence level. Unemployment and underemployment are widespread.&#13;
Rural populations have a desperate need for alternative paid work.&#13;
6.     The impact of conflict is a layer deeper than that of drought, having lasted longer. Many families&#13;
have been displaced internally or to neighboring countries, but people are returning to Afghanistan-&#13;
returnees and ex-combatants put additional pressure on resources. Trading, a traditional activity, has been&#13;
constrained but seems to be reviving. Some borders may not be crossed easily or at all, and in some&#13;
places "tolls" are also being exacted. Telecommunications and other utility services taken for granted&#13;
I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
elsewhere are almost nonexistent in Afghanistan. Credit is rarely available, and hardly worth the risk,&#13;
available via mortgages or suppliers' credits, implying high interest rates. Commercial banks do not&#13;
function-transactions need to be in cash or barter.&#13;
7.     Poor and deteriorated infrastructure further increases costs to rural populations. For many years,&#13;
public infrastructure has not been maintained. Irrigation canals have accumulated sedimentation and in&#13;
many places structures are in need of repair. Both of these conditions reduce water flows and hence&#13;
agricultural productivity. Unpaved provincial and district roads are poorly surfaced and hinder access,&#13;
even if their total length of about 18,000 km may be adequate given the population's concentration in&#13;
relatively small areas. The 3,000 km national paved network, almost circling the high mountains and with&#13;
spurs to neighboring countries, also is in poor condition, although scant motorized traffic has limited&#13;
serious deterioration. These roads permit only low speeds; often a short trip requires an overnight stay.&#13;
Non-motorized transport seems as important as motorized means in many parts of rural Afghanistan.&#13;
8.     While imported grains are needed, food aid is reported to be depressing farmer prices, lessening&#13;
incentives to put in the great effort required to produce wheat in risky times of drought, and increasing the&#13;
relative cost of acquiring non-farm goods by way of selling crops. Unfortunately, poppy cultivation&#13;
tolerates drought best because poppies can be grown almost anywhere in Afghanistan, is labor intensive,&#13;
and opiate products fetch a high price. In other words, poppy cultivation is a highly attractive source of&#13;
income given local circumstances, even though traders rather than farmers are the main beneficiaries.&#13;
However, about 75 percent of Afghanistan's opium production comes from only 2 of the country's 32&#13;
provinces.&#13;
II.    AIA STRATEGY: EMERGENCY AND DEVELOPMENT&#13;
9.     Despite being hampered by its very limited capacity, and a difficult security situation in many&#13;
parts of the country, the Afghanistan Interim Administration (AIA) has made considerable progress and is&#13;
gaining widespread international recognition and some moral authority. In April 2002, the AIA presented&#13;
a draft National Development Framework to the Interim Donors Group, which laid out the&#13;
administration's development strategy. It should be noted, however, that expectations among the&#13;
population for a "peace dividend" are high, and if the AIA and its successor do not deliver results&#13;
relatively quickly, the prospects for further progress and the peace process are likely to dim.&#13;
10.   Beyond popular expectations for a peace dividend, developing a strong framework for&#13;
strengthening local governance and promoting community development will be essential to reduce&#13;
poverty and to promote social cohesion in the country. AIA policy statements and follow-up actions&#13;
highlight the balance that must be struck between acting quickly on the humanitarian and reconstruction&#13;
agenda, and ensuring that emergency relief does not overwhelm the longer-term objective of creating&#13;
conditions that will promote economic growth, build sound administrative and financial institutions, give&#13;
people a voice in political decision making, and develop local capacities for action.&#13;
11.   The AIA has made community development a centerpiece of its development strategy. At the&#13;
Tokyo meeting, the Chairman of the AIA presented a bold vision for a national comnmunity development&#13;
program&#13;
We intend to implement a local empowerment program that would allow&#13;
communities to manage their own resources .... Such a program would&#13;
allow legitimate leaders to emerge to deal with issues facing their&#13;
communities and to form the basis for consultative democracy in the&#13;
future. Block grants would be distributed to villages and districts, and&#13;
allocated to projects through inclusive and participatory processes and on&#13;
the basis of simple criteria.&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12.    To help integrate this vision into the reconstruction program, AIA invited a joint donor mission to&#13;
Afghanistan in March 2002, in order to initiate design of a national community development framework&#13;
and program of actions. The joint mission included participants from the Asian Development Bank&#13;
(ADB), the European Community, the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme&#13;
(UNDP), the United Nations International Childrens' Emergency Fund (UNICEF), and the United&#13;
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).&#13;
13.   During the joint donor mission, a broad range of Afghan and international stakeholders were&#13;
consulted. It was found that there was strong support for a coordinated approach to community&#13;
development, including support for helping the AIA devise a national "single window" framework for&#13;
channeling support to communities through public transfers. This approach does not inhibit Non-&#13;
governmental (NGO) or other donor efforts, but rather provides a systematic approach for government&#13;
budget support, thus strengthening sustainability. The mission's recommendations were accepted by the&#13;
AIA.&#13;
14.    The AIA's proposal for a national village empowerment program will take place amidst a broad&#13;
set of community development activities. The overall picture of community development activities in&#13;
Afghanistan includes:&#13;
*  Sectoral activities that will respond to community needs. One group of activities will strengthen&#13;
government line agencies, particularly their ability to establish sectoral objectives, normnative&#13;
standards and regulatory capacities;&#13;
*  Afghan and international NGOs have for many years provided a broad range of basic services to&#13;
villages and are expected to continue doing so. NGOs at present cover all major service sectors:&#13;
rural development, water supply and sanitation, health, education, energy, and, to a lesser extent,&#13;
farm-to-market road construction. Approximately US$125 million has been programmed to go&#13;
through NGOs for community development activities during the next 2 years.&#13;
o Humanitarian and relief efforts to help returning refugees and internally displaced people adapt to&#13;
their new communities. Approximately US$180 million has been programmed to go through the&#13;
UNHICR and International Organization for Migration (IOM) to work with returning international&#13;
refugees and the internally displaced within Afghanistan.&#13;
*  Short-term public employment programs, such as labor-based road and canal maintenance. The&#13;
U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), UNDP, and the Department for&#13;
International Development (DFID) have funded or are expected to soon fund approximately&#13;
US$10 million each for targeted labor-based works programs.&#13;
15.    Because of the focus on ongoing relief and humanitarian programs, less attention has been given&#13;
to ways to strengthen the sub-national units of government-the administration of villages, districts, and&#13;
provinces. Over time, however, the Government of Afghanistan will need to build up a decentralized&#13;
service delivery system that fosters the respective "comparative advantages" in activities at these levels.&#13;
This is the niche within which the proposed program of community and local government development&#13;
actions will fit.&#13;
16.   Key to the success of this strategy will be whether programs can strike a proper balance between&#13;
supporting the local government's technical capacities to plan, manage, and monitor, and the need to&#13;
promote legitimate, acco'mtable local institutions. At present, however, districts remain extremely weak&#13;
or are controlled by regional warlords. Therefore, the short-term strategy covered by the community&#13;
program will focus on deveioping community and intercommunity capacities. Although some capacity&#13;
3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
development, particularly at the provincial level, will take place during the transitional period covered by&#13;
the proposed program, in general, province- and district-level strengthening programs will proceed&#13;
cautiously and on a case-by-case basis, as determined by the AIA.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
17.   Rebuilding Afghan communities will be a complex operation that will require close coordination&#13;
between technical service agencies, the humanitarian relief community, nongovemmental service&#13;
providers, and the AIA. Specific sectoral issues in Afghan community development include:&#13;
*  Decapitalization of the rural economy and rises in farmer indebtedness because of limited&#13;
competition to traditional suppliers of rural fmnance;&#13;
*  Breakdowns in local leadership, social capital, and local govemance;&#13;
*  Growing levels of ethnic polarization and rural violence;&#13;
*  Lack of basic productive infrastructure such as farm-market access roads, or tertiary canals; and&#13;
*  Need for vocational skills to support off-farm income sources;&#13;
18.   In many areas, the conflict has seriously damaged the agricultural base on which rural livelihoods&#13;
depend, either directly because of mines or ruined crops, or indirectly, because productive infrastructure&#13;
was not maintained or large segments of the rural population have fled. Traditional landlord-patron&#13;
exchanges have tipped in favor of landlords and moneylenders and levels of anger are high among rural&#13;
populations. In the wake of demobilization, unemployed and armed youth are at risk of tuming to crime&#13;
and violence. Furthermore, while the country comes to grips with the large inflow of grant aid,&#13;
reconstruction must be done in an environment where the risk of aid dependency is high, and the&#13;
incentives for building sustainability into community projects is low.&#13;
19.   On the positive side, Afghanistan's villages and neighborhoods have proven to be strikingly&#13;
resilient. Livelihoods have continued, and even during the Taliban period significant parts of the country&#13;
continued to receive development services from NGOs and private sector providers who worked with&#13;
community organizations. Afghan villagers traditionally have relied on extensive trading networks, and&#13;
these are expected to revive quickly once peace has been established and the villages have had&#13;
opportunities to recapitalize themselves. NGO best practices in Afghanistan have demonstrated that&#13;
community-driven projects can succeed even in the most inhospitable environments and in a wide variety&#13;
of sectors, provided that certain principles of participatory planning and technical quality management are&#13;
followed. Methods to ensure financial sustainability and good technical planning have been demonstrated&#13;
in Afghan community work and increasingly are being applied to other efforts.&#13;
III. IDA ASSISTANCE STRATEGY&#13;
AFGHANISTAN'S RELATIONS WITH IDA&#13;
20.    Afghanistan is a member of the Intemational Development Agency (IDA), the Intemational&#13;
Finance Corporation (IFC), the Intemational Monetary Fund (IMF), and the ADB. Afghanistan became a&#13;
member of IMF and the World Bank in 1955. IDA has provided 21 development credits to Afghanistan&#13;
since 1964; the last two, for roads and rural development, were approved in June 1979. IDA operations in&#13;
Afghanistan were suspended shortly after the 1979 Soviet invasion; of the US$230 million approved by&#13;
IDA, US$83 million was disbursed and US$147 million was subsequently canceled. Afghanistan has&#13;
repaid US$9.2 million to IDA and was up-to-date on debt service payments until June 1992, when it went&#13;
into non-accrual status. Although IDA has not extended any credits to Afghanistan since 1979, it has&#13;
remained engaged with the assistance community. Efforts included continuous monitoring of political and&#13;
economic developments; managing selective investments in the Afghan refugee communities; working&#13;
closely with the United Nations and donors; undertaking knowledge-building and knowledge-sharing&#13;
activities; and providing analytical and strategic inputs for the work of the wider assistance community.&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
AFGHANISTAN'S ARREARS TO IDA&#13;
21.    Resuming normal financial relations with IDA will require Afghanistan to clear outstanding&#13;
arrears which, as of January 31, 2002, total around US$51 million (including US$25.2 rnillion to IDA,&#13;
US$16 million to the ADB, and US$9.8 million to the IMF). The AIA is committed to clearing its arrears&#13;
to IDA before the end of 2002.&#13;
22.   IDA has not extended any credits to Afghanistan since 1979 although it has remained engaged&#13;
with the assistance community. Activities included continuous monitoring of political and economic&#13;
developments; managing selective investments in the Afghan refugee communities; working closely with&#13;
United Nations agencies and donors; undertaking knowledge-building and knowledge-sharing activities;&#13;
and providing analytical and strategic depth for the work of the wider assistance community.'&#13;
THE TRANSITIONAL SUPPORT STRATEGY&#13;
23.   IDA's Transitional Support Strategy (TSS), which was presented to the Board on April 4, 2002&#13;
with the Public Administration Technical Assistance Project, is predicated on the need for well-&#13;
coordinated efforts by Afghanistan's development partners to realize Afghanistan's reconstruction and&#13;
development priorities. IDA's key assistance objectives in Afghanistan over the next 6 to 9 months are to&#13;
assist the authorities in establishing capacity in areas essential to facilitate the reconstruction program; to&#13;
support high-priority reconstruction activities that can also help jumpstart economic activity; and to&#13;
continue to build IDA's knowledge base to allow for setting a well-designed program of future assistance.&#13;
To deliver assistance outside of Kabul, it will be vital to utilize the experiences and networks of NGOs&#13;
and United Nations agencies, and to develop mechanisms to channel funds directly to community groups&#13;
or traditional governance structures.&#13;
24.    Assistance to Afghanistan, for both recurrent and capital expenditures, is likely to be received&#13;
from various donors and delivered through a variety of mechanisms. Hence, aid coordination will be&#13;
essential to ensure a comprehensive and unified budget that is in line with agreed national priorities. One&#13;
mechanism to assist in such coordinated funding is the multi-donor, IDA-administered Afghanistan&#13;
Reconstruction Trust Fund that will provide financing for priority expenditures, including recurrent costs.&#13;
Donor funding for recurrent expenditures, including wage payments, is an essential element of the support&#13;
needed because the scope for own-revenue collection is at present very limited.&#13;
LEGAL BASIS FOR ASSISTANCE TO NON-ACCRUAL MEMBERS&#13;
25.    Under IDA's Twelfth Replenishment Resolution, IDA-12 donor funds may be used for post-&#13;
conflict grants under the following conditions: (i) the proposed grant has been designed in accordance&#13;
with OP 2.30; (ii) early performance is promising as evidenced by the recipient country having taken&#13;
convincing steps towards social and economic recovery; (iii) arrears to EBRD and/or IDA are large and&#13;
protracted, and cannot be easily or quickly cleared using domestic resources; (iv) a concerted&#13;
international effort to provide positive financial flows and other assistance is underway, and other&#13;
creditors have agreed not to make net withdrawals of financial resources from the country; and (v)&#13;
alternative sources of financing for post-conflict recovery are inadequate or available only on&#13;
inappropriate terms.&#13;
26.    With respect to the first two criteria, the proposed Grant has been designed in accordance with&#13;
OP 2.30, given that Afghanistan is in the midst of establishing a path towards social and economic&#13;
recovery. As for Afghanistan's arrears to IDA, it has been in non-accrual status since June 1992, with&#13;
outstanding principal of US$74.7 million and overdue principal and charges of US$25.2 million. In terms&#13;
See Afghanistan: World Bank Approach Paper, November 2001 for more details.&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
of criterion (iii), these amounts are "large and protracted" compared with Afghanistan's capability to&#13;
service debt, and Afghanistan does not have domestic resources available to clear them. As for the last&#13;
two criteria, the proposed grant would be part of the first steps in fulfilling the pledge by the World Bank&#13;
Group institutions to contribute to the international effort to assist Afghanistan; other multilateral&#13;
creditors have agreed not to make net withdrawals of financial resources prior to arrears clearance;&#13;
bilateral creditors are not expected to make net withdrawals; and alternative sources of funding are not&#13;
adequate to meet Afghanistan's needs in the immediate post-conflict period. Thus the proposed grant is&#13;
consistent with the adopted framework for IDA's provision of post-conflict grant assistance.&#13;
PROGRAM OF IDA GRANTS FOR EARLY SUPPORT TO POST-CONFLICT RECOVERY&#13;
27.    The proposed grant is part of a program of early IDA support to Afghanistan's post-conflict&#13;
recovery. The program includes the Emergency Public Administration Project (JS$10 million) which&#13;
was approved by IDA on April 4, 2002, the proposed Emergency Education Rehabilitation and&#13;
Development Project (US$15 million), the proposed Emergency Infrastructure Reconstruction Project&#13;
(US$33 million), and the proposed Emergency Community Empowerment and Public Works Project&#13;
(US$42 trillion). This program consists of priority activities that are scheduled to be implemented&#13;
rapidly, primarily during the next 12 months. Rather than bundling the package of emergency and quick&#13;
support into one operation, as has been done in some other post-conflict situations, the Afghanistan&#13;
program consists of several operations organized along logical groupings in order to enhance focus,&#13;
management efficiency, sustained sectoral focus during supervision, and orderly transition to normal IDA&#13;
support as lessons are learned from the various projects.&#13;
28.    Management and economic information gathered during the July-November implementation&#13;
period will be critical for preparing a larger, follow-on project for community development. This period&#13;
will also assess progress in developing provincial and district administration, and whether there is a need&#13;
for specialized targeting of highly vulnerable groups. Appraisal of the second phase should be completed&#13;
by no later than the end of 2002 so that full-scale operations can begin in 2003. A review will be made&#13;
also of possible continuation of labor based works on a routine basis.&#13;
IV.    PART A: THE PROPOSED PUBLIC WORKS PROGRAM&#13;
PROGRAM OBJECTIVES&#13;
29.    The objectives are: (i) provide employment in rural areas at a minimum wage, as a safety net, to&#13;
as many people and in as short a time as may be feasible; and (ii) to rehabilitate in a sustainable way&#13;
irrigation capacity and provincial- and district-level roads. Subprojects will be prioritized and selected at&#13;
the district level, taking into account both infrastructure and employment needs. In doing this, the&#13;
program will also support local planning and the hiring of some of the currently idle Afghan engineers,&#13;
skilled workers, and small contractors. Another objective is to complete the program by the end of 2002.&#13;
PROGRAM COMPONENTS&#13;
30.    The Public Works Program includes the following components totaling US$20 million&#13;
equivalent.&#13;
31.    Component A: District Grants for Subprojects (US$18.4 million). District grants generally&#13;
will not exceed US$130,000 equivalent. They will cover the cost of labor, materials, tools, transport&#13;
costs, and rental equipment, as required to undertake approved subprojects. About 130 of the country's&#13;
total 325 districts may be assisted. If additional funding becomes available from other donors, the&#13;
coverage could be expanded as justified, following demonstrated principles and processes.&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32.    Component B: Technical Assistance for Implementation (US$0.6 million). To assist the&#13;
Ministries of Public Works and Rural Development, who are responsible for the overall program&#13;
implementation of subprojects selected, the project will allow hiring of:&#13;
(i)    A small team of senior experts based in Kabul (four engineers, a Chief Financial Officer&#13;
[CFO], an information technology [IT] expert, and support staff). Firms, NGOs, and&#13;
experts already based in Afghanistan will be selected to assist with start-up activities and&#13;
install information systems. Firms and experts are expected to provide overall supervision&#13;
throughout implementation. Their contract will include the expenses to support engineers&#13;
who may be hired in the regions. Funding also has been allocated to cover foreign&#13;
advisory experts (about US$0.4 million equivalent).&#13;
(ii)   A core of 60 Afghan civil engineers, road engineers, and irrigation engineers, who will&#13;
assist in the provinces with designing and costing of district proposals, will provide&#13;
technical support to villagers and small contractors, and supervise works, expenditures,&#13;
and payments to workers (about US$0.2 million equivalent).&#13;
(iii)  A team of financial officers who will provide disbursements and keep accounts for the&#13;
proposed public works program and the community empowerment program. Branches of&#13;
the Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) are expected to provide the basic disbursement capacity,&#13;
supported as required by additional temporary consultants to be hired by the DAB for&#13;
these projects (an allocation of US$0.1 million has been made in case funding is&#13;
required).&#13;
33.    Component C: Monitoring and Preparing a Longer- term Program Proposal&#13;
(US$0.5 million).&#13;
(i)    Teams of independent monitors will be needed to do spot-checks on all aspects of the&#13;
project. Intensive independent reviews will take considerable time if for no other reason&#13;
than the extensive travel involved in visiting scattered subproject sites (about US$0.25&#13;
million).&#13;
(ii)   A team of experts will work with Ministry staff to review Project progress and results of&#13;
the program and other similar programs, in order to prepare a proposal for a labor-&#13;
intensive program that the Government could implement on a longer-term basis. The&#13;
proposal may include ways to support the establishment of small contractors (about&#13;
US$0.25 million).&#13;
34.    Component D: Incremental Operating Expenses (US$0.5 million).      The provincial&#13;
departments may require funding for incremental expenses in order to participate in the program. This&#13;
allocation, if not used, will be redirected to further work in district subprojects.&#13;
PROGRAM READINESS&#13;
35.    The Government would like the employment program to start immediately, but August is a more&#13;
realistic goal given the required preparation work. The project could start in parallel with the proposed&#13;
community empowerment program. Below is the set of preparation activities being undertaken prior to&#13;
July and to begin implementation.&#13;
36.    Geographical coverage and selection. While it may be desirable to provide a short-term public&#13;
employment source in every district by July, rolling out such a program to 325 districts in 32 provinces at&#13;
once would be daunting. The number of districts to be assisted is also constrained by available funding&#13;
and by the need for meaningful minimum allocations, as explained below. Some 30 rural districts could&#13;
9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
start implementation in August; and a second set of 90-110 districts could start implementation in&#13;
September. The subprojects to be implemented during the first month will be pilot projects. The program&#13;
as a whole also could be considered as a pilot, and could be expanded if needs, results, and additional&#13;
funds justify this.&#13;
37.    The district selection process will take into account population density, infrastructure needs,&#13;
number of unemployed, accessibility, absence of security problems, and presence of other programs.&#13;
Noting that the population is distributed very unevenly, the proposed Public Works Program is best suited&#13;
to high-density districts or subdistricts. The proposed approach would reach the most people, provide the&#13;
greatest benefits, and facilitate logistics. Districts with very low population densities and desert-type areas&#13;
with few roads and irrigation canals will be less amenable to labor-intensive works. It should be noted&#13;
that high-density areas are not necessarily the worst-off and leaving out provinces may be politically&#13;
difficult if other projects are not catering to these. Provincial Governors will be requested to select&#13;
districts and propose a priority list of investments for the program.&#13;
38.    District allocation decisions. Allocations per district must reflect disparate populations, needs,&#13;
and area sizes. A transparent allocation process will be necessary for fairness across districts. Allocations&#13;
would be based on US$2-3 per inhabitant in the selected districts, to allow for a 10-day employment&#13;
period per man expected to seek work. Three district allocation levels may be set. The district average is&#13;
expected to be approximately US$120,000. The selected rehabilitation subproject(s) in the district can be&#13;
sized to the funding available.&#13;
39.    Program implementation start up activities:&#13;
* Management consultants. Several NGOs that have maintained a presence in Kabul for years&#13;
have been identified as candidates for the detailed project preparation work and eventual&#13;
management of implementation, as a contractor to and in support of the Ministries of Public&#13;
Works, Rural Development, and Irrigation, if the latter needs to be involved in some&#13;
subprojects. Terms of reference have been prepared and an NGO will be selected and a&#13;
contract signed following grant negotiations.&#13;
* Civil engineers. The engineer recruitment process is expected to start in May. Identification&#13;
of engineers by the department heads will start in each province as soon as districts are&#13;
selected. It is anticipated that about four candidates per participating province (depending on&#13;
the number of districts covered) will attend a 2-week training workshop on the project&#13;
concept, ethical standards, and project paperwork and procedures, and will review work&#13;
methods and standards. The standards of the respective Ministries will be followed for the&#13;
road and irrigation canal rehabilitation programs. Engineers will be asked to pass a&#13;
"certification test" and the best candidates will be hired under individual contracts with the&#13;
management firm, to start work in the districts as soon as possible.&#13;
* Provincial or regional offices. A small office should be readied with basic capacity in the&#13;
dilapidated or empty department buildings or elsewhere, to accommodate the project&#13;
engineers. Further provincial office and equipment rehabilitation is intended under a&#13;
European Union project, but this is unlikely to be operational by the end of June.&#13;
40.    Project preparation and start-up activities (recruitment, training, etc.) would be funded under a&#13;
grant of US$100,000 equivalent. A preparation schedule has been agreed.&#13;
10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
41.    The Ministries of Public Works and Rural Rehabilitation and Development will be in charge of&#13;
work in their respective spheres and will be responsible for day-to-day management and implementation&#13;
of project activities, and reporting. The Ministries will be assisted by a small team of management&#13;
consultants based in Kabul. The consultants will be procured by the Afghanistan Assistance Coordination&#13;
Authority (AACA) and its procurement agent on behalf of the Ministry of Public Works and the Ministry&#13;
of Rural Development. This team will support the two ministries and help consolidate information. The&#13;
provincial departments will represent the Ministries at the provincial level. A team of provincial&#13;
departmental engineers will be involved in the program process, and a team of consultant engineers (size&#13;
depending on workload) will be recruited to be based in the provincial capitals to provide monthly&#13;
progress reports and to assist the works.&#13;
42.    The program will involve local authorities and communities. The program team will collaborate&#13;
closely with provincial- and district-level representatives during the planning stages, while line&#13;
directorates will ensure coordination with activities carried out by other development partners, to promote&#13;
efficient use of resources.&#13;
43.    Disbursements for district works are expected to be made through the DAB's provincial branches.&#13;
The DAB is currently refurbishing its branches and is expected to have trained financial staff by the time&#13;
they will be needed.&#13;
DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS BY COMPONENT&#13;
Component A: SubDroject District Grants&#13;
44.    Priority works. Eligible subprojects are restricted to rehabilitation or upgrading of primary and&#13;
secondary irrigation canals and provincial and district roads, because of their high labor content, relatively&#13;
easy preparation and implementation and expected high benefits. Traditionally managed irrigation&#13;
schemes will be excluded. Subprojects selected should be doable within the district allocation or with&#13;
clearly identified contributions from additional districts or villages. Works also should be able to be&#13;
completed within 7-9 months, using the expected work force. Seasonality must be considered, as the&#13;
wheat harvest season is July-August, which is likely to reduce the demand for public work during those&#13;
months. Labor-intensive works may also be more difficult when the cold weather starts in November&#13;
(later in low-lying areas). Village-level infrastructure will not be eligible, as this will be covered as part of&#13;
the community empowerment program.&#13;
45.    Following a dissemination process about the proposed program and allocations to the selected&#13;
districts, each district will rank its agreed priorities. Villagers will agree on the district's priorities through&#13;
a local consultation process and traditional councils. The heads of the provincial irrigation and/or roads&#13;
departments will review the proposals, endorse the selection and inscribe the chosen subprojects in the&#13;
provincial budget. If the provincial authorities have valid reasons to object to a proposed subproject, the&#13;
council will be invited to substitute another subproject. Compiling a district list should not take long, and&#13;
the agreed list will be forwarded to the governor for information and to the project engineers assigned to&#13;
the province and district.&#13;
46.    Participating districts are likely to request the sealing of subproject roads; this would prolong the&#13;
life of the works and could be justified in certain cases. However, this would greatly reduce the funds&#13;
available for labor payments, and would likely delay work completion given that more equipment would&#13;
be required. Sealing (under the grants) could be allowed if that was the district's choice, depending on the&#13;
quality of the gravel road construction and if at least some local contributions were made for such an&#13;
effort. Alternatively, sealing could wait for additional funds from other sources.&#13;
11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47.    Subproject engineering. Civil engineers hired for the project will prepare or verify surveys, cost&#13;
estimates, work plans, and other subproject preparations, starting with the highest priority subproject on&#13;
the district's list (if the list has more than one subproject). After verifying the subproject's appropriateness&#13;
for the allocation, the engineers will prepare contracts that must be signed by the elected foreman(s) and&#13;
the provincial department engineer(s); the provincial project engineer will countersign the contract(s).&#13;
48.    Works and supervision. The contracts will state the basis for payments. Engineers will track and&#13;
keep records on progress, workers, payments, and other matters. Spacing several work groups over the&#13;
subproject area or over several subprojects (perhaps up to 10 km of road upgrading or 20 km irrigation&#13;
canal cleaning and structure rehabilitation) and sequencing over time will be required, as it is unlikely that&#13;
it will be possible for all subprojects to be done on the same days during the same period. These works&#13;
will make slower progress if labor demand is less than planned; also, fewer men are expected to seek&#13;
employment during the July-August harvest season; this should allow a gradual buildup. Faster progress&#13;
would present even greater logistical difficulties, and not enough equipment such as compactors may be&#13;
available. Work is expected to be done from July to the end of December, and in some cases beyond&#13;
December.&#13;
49.    Target group and minimum wage. Unemployed, unskilled men in selected districts, willing to&#13;
work for a minimum wage estimated at US$1.50 equivalent per day, are expected to self-select for the&#13;
activities. The average district allocation will pay some 50,000 man-days. Also, skilled workers will be&#13;
employed at higher, prevalent wages.&#13;
50.    Equipment leasing and transport. Vehicles and equipment will be leased as needed and paid from&#13;
district grant funding; the project will not finance equipment purchases, although it may encourage small&#13;
contractors to buy. Small trucks can be rented locally; road building equipment is less widely available,&#13;
but it is expected that small contractors and departments of public works can lease equipment as&#13;
necessary. Some public works department equipment can be repaired if spare parts are provided and&#13;
mechanics are paid. Small local contractors may not have adequate water tanks or compactors, but it is&#13;
expected tnat they will be able to purchase or lease from larger contractors with the backing of the&#13;
subproject grant or suppliers or commercial credit.&#13;
Component B: Technical Assistance for Implementation&#13;
51.    The project will maximize use of the pool of Afghan talent. Only one or two foreign experts will&#13;
be involved as may be needed, on an ad-hoc basis.&#13;
52.    The Management Team is expected to include six experts, four senior engineers, a senior&#13;
financial manager, a computer/database expert; and translators and secretarial support. These people will&#13;
be hired under 6 to 8 month contracts, which will have provisions for renewal if necessary. The team will&#13;
be from a reputable NGO, which will be in charge of preparation activities, management systems, and&#13;
reporting. Vehicles, computers, related IT support and basic office equipment and supplies at the central&#13;
and provincial levels will be funded under their contract.&#13;
53.   It is expected that 60 or more civil engineers will be required for the district work. Private sector&#13;
candidates will be paid for the training and screening time, and those retained will be hired under 6-month&#13;
contracts that will have provisions for extension if justified.&#13;
Component C.: Monitoring and Preparing a Lon-aer- term Program Proposal&#13;
54.    Local NGOs and some foreign independent reviewers will monitor the Project. A complaint&#13;
system will be introduced. Some savings may be achieved if monitoring can be combined with other&#13;
12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
World Bank financed projects in the same geographical area. Terms of reference for monitoring work will&#13;
be agreed.&#13;
55.    A smaller program may be developed for use of labor-intensive techniques on a longer-term&#13;
basis. Employment demand by unskilled laborers is likely to persist for years, but equipment-intensive&#13;
methods may be more effective in terms of cost and quality. A cost-effective solution using as much&#13;
manual labor as feasible might be proposed for routine implementation by road departments. The&#13;
Ministry will be asked to assign selected staff to join the consultant study team. Terms of reference for&#13;
this work will be agreed.&#13;
PROGRAM RATIONALE&#13;
56.    Many destitute families need paid employment as crops have failed and assets have been&#13;
depleted. Labor-intensive works under this project could provide employment, water for irrigation, and&#13;
better accessibility to remote districts. It is likely that only the top local priorities will be completed.&#13;
These subprojects are not expected to produce a high economic return. Normally employment is not&#13;
counted as an economic benefit per se, or not even as an economic cost if the labor opportunity cost is&#13;
near zero with high unemployment. However, in Afghanistan, employment creation is essential; and will&#13;
be of equal importance as the infrastructure repairs even if lower construction costs could be achieved&#13;
with more equipment-intensive methods. The selection of districts will ensure the program a good&#13;
geographical initial targeting, and the subproject selection, through local consensus on priority works,&#13;
should enhance returns.&#13;
INFRASTRUCTURE BENEFITS&#13;
57.   Irrigation. After 3 years of drought and with about 80 percent of the population directly&#13;
dependent on the land for their livelihood, irrigation is a top reconstruction priority. Despite the&#13;
importance of water, few reservoirs and irrigation systems have been developed, because of the lack of&#13;
resources. Irrigation canals have accumulated sediment and require cleaning for effective use when water&#13;
is available; some of these canals are the responsibility of public departments who have no funds. It is&#13;
customary in Afghanistan for farmers to provide voluntary cooperative labor to clean tertiary irrigation&#13;
canals. Thus, priority major canal cleaning and repairs will be eligible for funding under district grants,&#13;
but activities that are normally done for free will not be eligible, except under extraordinary&#13;
circumstances. The benefits from irrigation works will depend on a return to more normal snow and&#13;
rainfall levels and thus cannot be predicted. However, irrigation water might allow a second yearly crop,&#13;
changing to a higher value crop, greater yields, or a first crop on previously unproductive land. Population&#13;
in Afghanistan's few cultivable areas is dense. For instance, in the Tagab District, Kapisa Province (north&#13;
of Kabul), a canal averaging 3.2 km irrigates 115 ha (some 180 m on each canal side) for 228 families,&#13;
each possessing an average of 0.5 ha. Farmers may own and depend on as little as 0.2 ha of arable land;&#13;
many men are sharecroppers paying one-half to two-thirds of their income to the landowner.&#13;
58.    Roads. Another priority will be to improve radial access between provincial and district centers,&#13;
and from district centers to main villages. The distance between villages can be as little as 5 km or as&#13;
much as 20 or more Iam, especially in mountainous areas. Some villages have only 20 or so compound&#13;
houses, or many more compounds, often in several subclusters. Only local roads serving significant&#13;
populations will be eligible for funding under the program. In some instances, tracks may be upgraded; in&#13;
other instances roads require rehabilitation after years of neglected maintenance-although light traffic&#13;
and drought have somewhat contained deterioration. District roads built to 4 m wide plus shoulders&#13;
should suffice where traffic is light, elsewhere 7 m wide may be justified. Even though motorized traffic&#13;
is currently low, motorcycle and pickup traffic is expected to increase as soon as roads are passable,&#13;
especially if water becomes more available and agricultural production increases. Main district roads also&#13;
should have good surface conditions for non-motorized transport, such as carts, bicycles, and pedestrians.&#13;
Sealing would be desirable; it may be required on slopes or be justified to protect a fine granular surface&#13;
13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
topping, given the harsh climate, the expected low maintenance requirements, and the closeness of Iran,&#13;
where asphalt products can be supplied at low costs, much lower than in countries further away from&#13;
supplies. However, sealing will also depend on funding availability, and the option will have to be&#13;
evaluated in each case, based on each road's individual merits.&#13;
59.    Output. It is estimated that upgrading 1 km of gravel road, 4 m wide, would require some 4,000&#13;
unskilled labor-days, and cost about US$12,000 equivalent, or more than US$20,000 if a bitumen seal&#13;
coat is applied. It is calculated that cleaning and repairing small structures on 1 km of irrigation canal&#13;
would absorb more than 2,000 unskilled labor-days, and cost US$5,000 equivalent. Irrigation works&#13;
would be more labor-intensive than road works, and local leaders will need to take this into account when&#13;
assessing and selecting priority works-paid employment may be the overriding objective. The output in&#13;
terms of infrastructure rehabilitation should be considerable: some combination of more than 1,000 km of&#13;
roads or 4,500 km of canals.&#13;
EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS&#13;
60.    The neediest districts will be selected through a consultative process-although there will be little&#13;
risk of geographic mis-targeting, as most areas are in need. The minimum wages to be offered should&#13;
incite the poorest men to offer themselves for work. Agricultural wages tend to be 2-3 times higher than&#13;
that which will be offered. This is because agricultural wages include the unofficial labor of one or two&#13;
family members (however, these family members could continue this work outside of the project).&#13;
Women are not expected to participate in public works because of the local culture;- however, women will&#13;
benefit from higher household incomes and from other programs. The employment/safety net objective&#13;
and the basic wage rate used for the project will make labor-based works competitive with equipment-&#13;
based road works. A review of the wage level switching point will be made as part of the project study.&#13;
61.    Assuming labor is on average 60 percent of subproject cost (50 percent for road works, 70&#13;
percent for irrigation works), US$18 million in district grants would provide 7 million unskilled labor-&#13;
days, plus employment for Afghan engineers and other skilled workers. If there are 2 million rural&#13;
households in Afghanistan, (I million in districts selected for the first round of subprojects, including&#13;
returnees and ex-combatants), and one man from each household is eligible to work, excess up-front&#13;
demand should be expected even as other programs operate. The wage is expected to vary from US$1.50&#13;
to US$2 equivalent per day, because there are regional variations in the cost of living. Limiting the man-&#13;
days of work any household obtains may be necessary, as work demand is likely to exceed the absorptive&#13;
capacity. Rationing and sequencing may be required; limits will be set in such cases as practical. Ten&#13;
days' work will pay only US$15-20 and 20 days' work will pay US$30-40. This is not an insignificant&#13;
amount, however, given that per capita incomes are less than US$1 per day, and each working-age man&#13;
supports four or more family members.&#13;
US$18 million in district grants could provide US$11 million in wages:&#13;
Estimated     Ma-as        Number of Workers wlth-mork limit&#13;
Average daily   (minfionI)       20 days           10 days.-&#13;
wage (US$)&#13;
1.50          7.0        390,000 workers   780,000 workers&#13;
62.   In the future, labor-intensive public infrastructure projects may be less justified than in the current&#13;
circumstances. Better wages are expected to be forthcoming from agriculture or other private sector&#13;
activities. Anticipated future migration to cities and employment in secondary or tertiary sectors is&#13;
expected to lead to higher income levels (although the irrigation and road works will benefit those staying&#13;
in agriculture), and equipment-intensive methods may then provide lower unit building costs. However,&#13;
for some years to come, demand for work by unskilled laborers is expected to persist, and it is projected&#13;
14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
that some activities can be performed well and cost-effectively using labor-intensive methods. Therefore,&#13;
project monitoring and evaluation will include a review of costs and benefits to define prospects and&#13;
future programs.&#13;
RISKS AND PROGRAM ALTERNATIVES&#13;
63.    The project builds on NGO and public works departments' experience; the approach is not totally&#13;
new in Afghanistan. Nevertheless, the project carries significant risk, given the short preparation time&#13;
available to establish work quality and financial controls. There is a risk of leakage, given the activities'&#13;
dispersed nature; and the great need for funds everywhere. Quality may be lower than intended.&#13;
Monitoring and supervision should limit diversions and payment for low-quality output. Equipment may&#13;
be unavailable within the short lead and implementation times that employment objectives dictate.&#13;
Despite the considerable risks, the project design is nevertheless preferred to other alternatives given the&#13;
importance of the employment objectives:&#13;
(i) The next best alternative to labor-intensive works probably would be welfare payments.&#13;
These have the advantages that all funds would go to needy families; that no energy would&#13;
be spent on working on public schemes, which would necessitate more food intake; and&#13;
that organizational requirements are much less under a subsidy distribution system.&#13;
However, welfare payments erode pride, lessen morale, and eventually could be addictive.&#13;
And for an estimated 35 percent more than the projected cost of a welfare scheme, the&#13;
project's labor scheme could provide and improve public assets that are expected to help&#13;
increase future earnings in rural areas.&#13;
(ii)  Food for work is not an attractive altemative. Monetizing food for work would be&#13;
preferable. The logistic cost of food aid tends to be high, more than that of labor-intensive&#13;
works on a cash payment basis, and is even higher when including the costs of transporting&#13;
food from remote intemational locations. It is possible that food aid could be provided to&#13;
areas where crops have failed due to drought, not in excess of the amounts that normally&#13;
would have been harvested, or to areas of absolute food shortage where production prices&#13;
would not be depressed by the aid.&#13;
COMPLEMENTARY PROGRAMS&#13;
64.    The project seeks to provide funding in sectors where other lenders do not. Complementary&#13;
projects include:&#13;
(i) The IDA-grant financed Community Empowerment Program (CEP) (also financed under&#13;
this Project) is planned to start at the same time as the proposed program. The CEP would&#13;
start in one or two districts per province, as selected by the govemors and distribute&#13;
community grants to villages. This public works program proposes to start work in more&#13;
districts, given the need for employment.&#13;
(ii)  Various National Road Rehabilitation Projects, for priority areas of the 3,000 km paved&#13;
road network. The projects will start later, rely on contractors, and necessarily will be more&#13;
equipment-intensive, though labor will be employed as well. A wider program in support of&#13;
agricultural development is planned for later in 2002 for support by various agencies.&#13;
(iii) Various village programs implemented by other agencies, including food for work and&#13;
opium eradication programs that were active in early 2002 (and in earlier years); i.e., the&#13;
IOM program, with a budget of US$180 million. Villagers who have obtained funds from&#13;
these programs will not have priority for employment under this project.&#13;
15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(iv) Other projects will provide for schools and clinics. Electrification, while urgently needed,&#13;
requires more complex solutions, will take longer to prepare, and will be less labor-&#13;
intensive to build; some dams could be built for small-scale hydroelectric energy schemes.&#13;
MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
65.    This project will include intensive scrutiny, because of the potential for leakages. The incentive to&#13;
divert funds will be high. Independent teams will monitor the various subprojects, physical outputs will&#13;
be closely compared to financial results, and the MIS system will be designed to trigger alerts. The&#13;
evaluation is also needed in case the AIA finds that it is worthwhile to continue labor-intensive efforts, in&#13;
order to implement them using the best possible design.&#13;
66.    Sanctions will be applied wherever monitors, supervisors, or other reviewers find irregularities.&#13;
Engineers involved in corruption will be fired and subproject funding will be discontinued. Use of&#13;
community grants will be limited by a negative list. The negative list will exclude any activity aimed at&#13;
poppy cultivation or marketing. The project will also seek assurance that participating communities do&#13;
not engage in poppy cultivation. Project funding would be terminated for communities which do not&#13;
comply with these agreements. The people working on these subprojects will be aware of these sanctions&#13;
as they will be a part of the information campaign that will precede the work start.&#13;
V.     PART B: THE PROPOSED COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT PROGRAM&#13;
PROGRAM OBJECTIVES&#13;
67.    The objectives of the 2-year community empowerment program are to:&#13;
a. Support participatory planning and the strengthening of local govemance structures.&#13;
b. Help villages rebuild their capital base through the provision of subgrants, and empower&#13;
villagers to plan for, and decide on, the investments to be made with the proceeds of the&#13;
subgrants. These subgrants could be used for:&#13;
*  Public infrastructure improvements or reconstruction of houses destroyed by conflict;&#13;
and&#13;
*  Developing community assets, establishing revolving funds, and buying training or&#13;
technical services.&#13;
c. Provide a mechanism for linking community development needs with line agency and NGO&#13;
service providers.&#13;
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION&#13;
68.    The proposed National Community Empowerment Program supports the AlA's proposal for a&#13;
single-window framework for community development. The program will launch a national program to&#13;
recapitalize villages and urban neighborhoods so that they may return to a more normal level of activity&#13;
within their usual economic and trading systems, and to provide poor rural and urban communities with&#13;
higher standards of living. Assistance design is intended to avoid creating an aid and dependency culture.&#13;
The program also seeks to restore or develop healthy linkages between communities and legitimate local&#13;
governments, including technical service providers.&#13;
69.   Implementation is expected to be difficult. Community institutions in many parts of Afghanistan&#13;
have been subject to a broad range of crises over the past 2 decades that undoubtedly have undermined&#13;
their abilities to act as corporate groups. With the additional need to reintegrate returnees, communal&#13;
decision making and cooperation may pose difficulties but also is expected to help improve&#13;
16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
understanding. The program has been designed to establish checks and balances, incentives and penalties,&#13;
and community management procedures so that villages and neighborhoods can use social controls&#13;
effectively.&#13;
70.    The program will consist of a series of block grants, which will be allocated directly to villages in&#13;
pre-determined amounts and will be held in collectively owned village accounts. The grants will be used&#13;
to support proposals developed by village groups through a facilitated planning process. The program also&#13;
will provide a medium-term program of community capacity development, which over time will move to&#13;
intervillage and village-district forms of cooperative planning, as local governance improves and&#13;
revitalized state institutions take root in the countryside.&#13;
71.    Keys to the program's success are: (a) a tiered system of technical and social facilitators recruited&#13;
from NGOs and the Afghan private sector; (b) representative local bodies, with locally selected&#13;
representation; (c) a process for the technical review of subproject proposals and the provision of&#13;
technical assistance during their implementation; (d) support for village management of financial records,&#13;
procurement, and program implementation; (e) full transparency, through a proactive program of&#13;
disclosure through oral and written media and through extensive civil society involvement; (f) an&#13;
efficient, reliable and fast system for local-level disbursements; and (g) a process of continual evaluation&#13;
and review to adapt the program to Afghanistan's highly varied and changing environment.&#13;
72.    The program will build in a progressive series of steps to strengthen local governance. These will&#13;
include expansion of local councils through a democratic selection process based on merit and capacity;&#13;
the development of financial management skills; strengthening mechanisms for intervillage and, over&#13;
time village-district coordination; and a program of provincial-level activities designed to improve the&#13;
line agencies' responsiveness to village requests. Capacity development activities will also include a&#13;
broad program of networking so that villages will be linked to government, NGO, UN Agencies, and&#13;
other service providers who can respond to local demand.&#13;
73.    Site selection will be done by national and provincial government. Accessibility and security will&#13;
be major site selection criteria for the first round of subprojects. Each participating province will select&#13;
two or three districts on the basis of criteria including poverty, number of returnees, and lack of&#13;
alternative providers. Villages will be divided into three or four population bands, and grant sizes will be&#13;
adjusted to each band so that per capita amounts remain roughly constant. (Population counts will be&#13;
adjusted annually because of the large number of returnees expected to be entering village lists.)&#13;
74.    The grant cycle will proceed through two stages. The first stage consists of a 2- to 4-month&#13;
facilitated village planning process. Grant amounts will range from US$10,000 -to US$20,000 per&#13;
village, depending on the village's population. Except for a short negative list of items and sectors&#13;
prohibited by IDA policies, grant options will be kept open. Communities will be expected to contribute&#13;
but no mandatory thresholds will be established. Experience elsewhere has shown that block grants (hard&#13;
budget constraints) allow for better optimization of local participation, particularly in areas with highly&#13;
unequal abilities to contribute, such as post-conflict zones. Despite the disrupted environment, community&#13;
contributions are expected to be very high. Villages will be encouraged to obtain support from other&#13;
providers such as private providers, NGOs, UN Agencies, and govemment technical agencies before they&#13;
resort to using their own funds.&#13;
75.    Technical inputs during the planning and implementation process will come from provincial-level&#13;
consultants, and the provincial consultant teams will include engineers who can support village proposals&#13;
and prequalify commercial and NGO support. Community forums will also engage technical services&#13;
from govemment agencies as these recover as a result of the reconstruction program.&#13;
76.    The second stage of the grant cycle will not be covered by this program but will be addressed&#13;
through a follow-on project, tentatively scheduled for CY2003. As communities mature and their most&#13;
17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
immediate needs are met, grant sizes will be reduced to a sustainable level, to be determined through a&#13;
joint review with the AIA. These grants can be complemented by community contributions and local&#13;
revenue sources. The development of district-level government may have progressed and could&#13;
potentially be supported by the follow-on program. By that time, the program is expected to have&#13;
gathered sufficient information to introduce formulas for poverty targeting and more accurate population&#13;
weightings.&#13;
77.   This component will be implemented by the AACA on a transitional basis, which has specialized&#13;
staff and experience with community development program. The component will move to the Ministry of&#13;
Rural Reconstruction and Development (MRRD) as soon as it has sufficient capacity; the program&#13;
includes activities to strengthen the ministry during the 6-month start-up period. Implementation of the&#13;
community grant program in the provinces will be through MVIRRD, which will also be strengthened by&#13;
the program. Provincial budgets include the costs of refurbishing and equipping a management office.&#13;
Provincial and district launch workshops will be held between July and September 2002.&#13;
78.   At the provincial level the program will be housed with MRRD, and will work closely with each&#13;
office to provide training and hands-on experience with community-led development programming.&#13;
MRRD will coordinate a multi-sectoral board that will meet each month to set standards, review progress,&#13;
and solve problems. Provincial MRRD offices will also coordinate monthly meetings of NGOs and&#13;
humanitarian agencies to provide overall progress reviews and help villages identify service providers.&#13;
Program budgets will include core funds for rehabilitating MRRD, and they will be complemented by a&#13;
European Commission commitment to help rebuild provincial and district government offices.&#13;
79.   Program operations will build on a tiered system of technical support. During the first year, the&#13;
program will be managed centrally by a national oversight consultant, who will also recruit and train the&#13;
provincial implementation teams. As these are deployed, operations managemrent will move to the&#13;
provinces, which will become autonomous management units. The national consultant will remain&#13;
responsible for financial reporting, national monitoring, training materials, information exchange, and&#13;
policy reviews. Two-person district teams will provide day-to-day support to the villages, primarily&#13;
training in technical design, facilitation, and complaints management. Serniannual workshops for regional&#13;
groupings and annual reviews for the entire team will review results and progress.&#13;
80.   Timing and Procedures. The first US$22 million operation will cover an estimated 600-800&#13;
villages and neighborhoods, depending on whether participating villages go through one grant cycle or&#13;
two. The program's field launch in 25-30 districts could begin as early as July 2002. By December 2002&#13;
another 60-90 districts might be added, provided that additional funding has been secured. A follow-on&#13;
appraisal in December 2002, to be carried out jointly with the European Commission and other interested&#13;
donors, will review GoA proposals to make this a national program that will cover all Afghan&#13;
communities.&#13;
81.   The program will begin in one or two districts in each of Afghanistan's 32 provinces, both to&#13;
provide a quick start to the national reconstruction program and to permit an assessment of how well this&#13;
design can deal with Afghanistan's diverse environment. Districts will be selected through a screening&#13;
process that will solicit proposals from local governments; these proposals will be subject to site reviews&#13;
and verification before finalization. Most villages in each district will be covered. By the end of the&#13;
current program, each province should have completed at least one full grant cycle and evaluated its&#13;
performance. In addition, preparations in an additional 70-95 districts are expected to be underway.&#13;
Assumning that funding is available and that the security situation stabilizes, national coverage could be&#13;
attained by the end of CY2005.&#13;
18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
DESCRIPTION OF COMPONENTS&#13;
82.    Component A: Village Grants Program (US$16.0 million). Grant amounts will vary depending&#13;
on village populations and location. The grants can be used for public infrastructure, community assets&#13;
and revolving funds, social services, and training. Grants will be transferred directly to a community&#13;
account, although their amounts will be recorded in provincial and district budgets as these become&#13;
operative. Grant proposals will receive technical and financial screening, including site verifications.&#13;
Money will be released against the verified proposal, minutes of the final decision meeting, and a contract&#13;
between the community forum and the executing agency.&#13;
83.    Component B: Implementation Support (US$4.8 million). The program will recruit and train&#13;
technical and social facilitators whose jobs will be to provide oversight, community organizing, and&#13;
training to the communities and neighborhoods. Initially program management will be concentrated in&#13;
Kabul, but a fast rollout is expected, which will involve setting up and staffing small provincial project&#13;
management offices. This component will also: (a) provide training in basic procurement, financial&#13;
management, and planning for provincial, district, and village organizations; (b) support exercises to&#13;
involve government service providers, NGOs, and the private sector in village planning and response; and&#13;
(c) provide villages and neighborhoods with advice in microfinance and small business management.&#13;
Project budgets will include sufficient budgets to allow MMIRD to rebuild, equip, and train sections of&#13;
their office where the program will be housed, including one vehicle per office.&#13;
84.    Component C: Monitoring and Evaluation Studies (US$1.2 million). The quality of&#13;
information about local institutions and populations must be improved significantly to support the&#13;
government's policy objective of malcing community-driven programming a cornerstone of its&#13;
development policy. This component will include four main activities. First, it will support a series of&#13;
data collection exercises to gather baseline information on living standards and household expenditures,&#13;
basic needs, population variables, and development activities. Second, contracts with Kabul and&#13;
provincial universities will develop a program of evaluation studies that will examine socioeconomic&#13;
changes taking place in communities. Their purpose will be to allow for refinements to the overall&#13;
program, particularly with respect to marginal and vulnerable groups (nomadic communities would be a&#13;
special focus). Third, baseline data will be gathered to support impact evaluation studies for the follow-on&#13;
program. These will include cost-benefit reviews of infrastructure, maintenance evaluations, and returns&#13;
on investments. Fourth, the component will fund project monitoring by independent parties. Project&#13;
monitoring will gather more accurate price information for preparing the national program, in addition to&#13;
ensuring that program implementation remains on track and in agreement with its design standards.&#13;
PROGRAM BENEFITS&#13;
85.    Perhaps the most important benefit of the program will be its support to sustainable, local&#13;
institutions, in order to link villagers to the national economy without going through warlords or&#13;
clientelistic politics. Post-war recovery in Afghanistan will require new planning, mediation, leadership,&#13;
and entrepreneurial skills, all of which will be supported through the project.&#13;
86.   It is premature to calculate economic and financial benefits in such a disrupted environment. For&#13;
this reason the program will collect detailed monitoring data so that the follow-on project can make more&#13;
realistic assessments of the expected returns on individual subproject investments. Cost data reported by&#13;
NGOs working in Afghanistan suggest that the small village and neighborhood investments proposed&#13;
under the program will have a positive return, and that these benefits will increase under the proposed&#13;
design because of lower overhead costs.&#13;
87.    Beneficiaries of the program are expected to be the country's poor and near-poor. In villages and&#13;
urban neighborhoods, subproject choices are likely to be infrastructure repair and revolving funds.&#13;
However, the most immediate, measurable justification will come from the employment and re-&#13;
19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
capitalization benefits that the program will provide to the poor and to very small community businesses.&#13;
Experience in other countries suggests that some 60-70 percent of program funds return to local labor,&#13;
and virtually all of the benefits from the physical works will accrue to primary producers. Thus,&#13;
approximately US$10-1 I million will be given as direct wages to the poor.&#13;
88.    Labor on physical works will be unpaid for small works that take less than a month to complete;&#13;
for larger activities a sub-minimum agricultural wage will allow for self-targeting. This policy will be&#13;
applied flexibly as there are areas of such poverty and devastation that reconstruction cannot begin&#13;
without a means of interim subsistence. Project facilitators in the provinces will negotiate solutions such&#13;
as rationing and work quotas on a case-by-case basis with their assigned communities.&#13;
89.    Startup costs are necessarily high because they will include several large one-time charges (e.g.,&#13;
establishing provincial offices, vehicle and computer purchases), which will be the same regardless of&#13;
how many districts later join the program. Total overhead for the 4-year program is expected to amount to&#13;
about 17-20 percent of costs, which is comparable to similar projects elsewhere.&#13;
90.    Management and   economic information  gathered  during  the  July-November 2002&#13;
implementation period will be critical for preparing the larger, follow-on project. This period will also&#13;
assess progress in the development of provincial and district administration capacity, and whether there is&#13;
a need for targeting of the highly vulnerable groups. Appraisal of the second phase should be completed&#13;
by no later than the end of December 2002 so that full-scale operations can begin in 2003.&#13;
91.    The community development sectoral challenge for the reconstruction effort, therefore, is one of&#13;
providing effective development services to villages and neighborhoods-but even more importantly, one&#13;
of making communities active players in the rebuilding process. Afghanistan is at a unique crossroads. In&#13;
a large, rural country such as Afghanistan, peace and development will be enhanced in village&#13;
communities when villagers recognize that government institutions can provide a better, safer alternative&#13;
to warlords and patronage.&#13;
COMPLEMENTARY ACTIVITIES&#13;
92.    The Community Empowerment component will work in tandem with the proposed Public Works&#13;
Program component, which will offer poor villagers labor-intensive employment on provincial and&#13;
district infrastructure, and the same aggregate requirements will apply to this component as well. IDA-&#13;
funded projects in rural and urban development also will complement the community project.&#13;
93.    A broad range of NGO projects will complement the activities of the community project. AACA&#13;
has established a working group that involves NGOs to help advise the project and also to provide a&#13;
mechanism for sharing information about local conditions, needs, and opportunities. The European&#13;
Commission has been especially closely involved in ensuring that communication between NGOs and the&#13;
government's proposed community program is constant and constructive.&#13;
COOPERATION WITH OTHER DONORS&#13;
94.    This project complements several types of donor reconstruction projects taking place in&#13;
Afghanistan. In 2002 approximately 26 million euros of European Community financing will go through&#13;
NGOs who will work closely with the Community Project team and offer services to participating&#13;
communities; the EC will join the appraisal of the follow-on project. The Japanese Social Development&#13;
Fund is currently reviewing a proposal to top off community projects supported by NGOs; this also works&#13;
in tandem with the proposed project. Discussions are also underway with DFID and USAID to launch the&#13;
project in areas covered by opium eradication programs, where showing the positive presence of the new&#13;
Afghan state will be a big part of making the drug control program succeed. Coordination of community&#13;
development planning has recently been significantly enhanced through the establishment of a joint AIA-&#13;
20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
UN coordination structure, in which community development is a free-standing entry, and the AACA's&#13;
formation of a community development task force that it uses as a forum for discussions with&#13;
intemational and national NGOs.&#13;
LESSONS LEARNED FROM OTHER PROJECTS&#13;
95.    Projects planned and managed by communities typically show rates of return higher than those&#13;
planned by govemment agencies for these same villages. Subprojects selected through a local planning&#13;
process also usually are better maintained than projects built on the basis of an external master plan,&#13;
particularly in countries with tight budgetary constraints for local maintenance work.&#13;
96.    A growing body of evidence from Bank-financed projects demonstrates that community projects&#13;
are particularly appropriate for post-conflict environments. In the Rwanda Reintegration Project, for&#13;
example, close attention to using joint community activities to promote reconciliation between ethnic&#13;
groups has been so successful that the Rwandan Government has extended the post-conflict design into its&#13;
national development plan. Another benefit of this approach in post-conflict environments is its speed.&#13;
The East Timor Community Empowerment Project was able to attain national coverage within I year of&#13;
appraisal (albeit in a very small country), and it will be retained by the post-transition govemment. These&#13;
projects have demonstrated conflict management outcomes, reducing tensions between residents.&#13;
97.    Bearing in mind that the Afghan context is in many ways sui generis because of the extreme&#13;
levels of destruction and the long-term nature of the conflict, the proposed project draws on several&#13;
general lessons from other community development and post-conflict projects. These include:&#13;
*  Community block grant projects can be scaled up very quickly and can function in highly&#13;
diverse environments because of their modular design;&#13;
*  Establishing a participatory process and decision making body initially adds some time to&#13;
project preparation but will provide long-term and highly justified payoffs;&#13;
*  Open menus allow a better reflection of local needs than preselected ones do;&#13;
*  High quality technical support to communities makes for better outcomes and longer-term&#13;
sustainability. Private sector providers and NGOs should be used where available;&#13;
*  Community-managed subprojects are usually preferable to those involving central contracting&#13;
in environments where contract management is weak and the opportunities for enforcement&#13;
are low;&#13;
*  Community-driven projects should begin from a strategy for linking up their planning and&#13;
investments to district and provincial management, although this linkage should be sequenced&#13;
very carefully, particularly in post-conflict environments;&#13;
*  Post-conflict projects should be short, so that they can be reevaluated as the reconstruction&#13;
process takes hold.&#13;
98.    Three design and management lessons of special relevance stand out for designing the proposed&#13;
community project:&#13;
* Advance clarification and clear communication of all community procurement, disbursement,&#13;
and financial management procedures will be essential, not just for the success of the overall&#13;
program, but for the success of the community planning approach;&#13;
21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
* Technical support and training will be needed to introduce better-quality infrastructure&#13;
designs, and to prequalify engineers, agronomists, and other potential supports for the&#13;
villages, but if this step is done there is no reason why villages cannot procure and manage&#13;
high quality TA;&#13;
* Prompt and decisive use of sanctions is needed for communities and project officials if they&#13;
do not follow agreed-upon rules.&#13;
99.    There is also a relevant set of negative lessons learned, only some of which can be fully&#13;
mitigated:&#13;
* Risks of elite capture of benefits are high, particularly in conmmunities with pronounced class&#13;
differences. Mitigation measures will include external facilitation, a focus on public rather&#13;
than private goods, and an intense program of outreach and transparency.&#13;
* Communities usually do not have access to formal systems of redress. Community-based&#13;
projects thus depend on transparency and social controls to prevent corruption and fraud.&#13;
Support from civil society groups (NGOs, legal advocacy organizations, press, academics,&#13;
etc) must be designed in from the outset or else local problems will not be referred upwards,&#13;
particularly if local government or technical assistance staff are involved.&#13;
* Communities with long histories of aid dependency or in areas of extensive government&#13;
service delivery will not willingly provide large contributions or maintenance.&#13;
100.   Afghanistan over the years has had an uneven record with community development, and this can&#13;
only have become more complicated in recent times with the large amount of social dislocation and&#13;
conflict that has taken place. Lessons gained from consultations with NGOs and community workers that&#13;
will be applied to this project include:&#13;
* Give communities enough time during planning to ensure full understanding and ownership&#13;
of the process. Pressures to "do something" quickly undermine the need to create spaces for&#13;
negotiation and mediation.&#13;
* "Formal" institutions such as village and district shuras form a good basis for local planning&#13;
but they also have their weaknesses. Most NGOs build in a process by which communities&#13;
select additional representatives to shuras;&#13;
* Villages should not be paid for labor on projects, especially those which can be completed&#13;
relatively quickly (i.e., under a month). Larger projects that can take several months will&#13;
require some form of stipend for labor or else the poor will not be able to afford to&#13;
participate.&#13;
* Most Afghan villages can procure technical services and project inputs on the open market.&#13;
* Be selective-areas that are effectively controlled by warlords or single-family elites should&#13;
be excluded from the program. There will also be deeply traumatized or disrupted areas&#13;
which will require extra facilitation before community planning can be initiated. Timetables&#13;
and budgets should reflect the need for this kind of flexibility.&#13;
* Projects should build in performance incentives and "maturity" measures that will allow&#13;
communities to take on larger tasks as they gain experience and capacity in community-based&#13;
planning and management.&#13;
22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
101.   Lessons gained from consultation with the Interim Administration include:&#13;
*  Project designs should reflect a long-term rather than a short-term vision, with a special focus&#13;
on developing more representative and democratic forms of local leadership, and a long-term&#13;
research capacity that helps the government understand macro social changes in the&#13;
countryside;&#13;
*  It is premature to do more than basic planning and coordination with districts, even though&#13;
eventually community planning should involve the district administration for larger&#13;
investments.&#13;
102.   Capacity support provided to provincial and district government should focus on strengthening&#13;
their planning, monitoring, and coordination roles but not on implementation. Local government should&#13;
be involved in a long-term process of responsiveness to bottom-up demand.&#13;
ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED&#13;
103.  The Bank team reviewed three alternative designs, all of which also appeared to be potentially&#13;
appropriate for the Afghan context:&#13;
* A scaled-up program of NGO support;&#13;
* A Social Fund;&#13;
* Microfinance.&#13;
104.  NGOs at present cover at most about 10-15 percent of the country's villages. Bilateral and&#13;
European Commission scale-up plans for NGO support are substantial. They are already close to their&#13;
management capacities.&#13;
105.   Social funds are a reasonable option that have worked well in other post-conflict situations and in&#13;
several important respects are very close to what is being proposed here. Direct grants to communities,&#13;
however, are considered to be a more efficient management scheme for fast startups in an environment&#13;
where communications are very poor and management skills are scarce.&#13;
106.  It is likely that communities, particularly those that before the wars were deeply involved in&#13;
trading, will use their community funds to recapitalize their farms and businesses. The Consultative&#13;
Group to Assist the Poorest (CGAP) is coordinating with the project team and if a microfinance project&#13;
materializes, it will work closely with the proposed project. However, even under the most optimistic&#13;
scenario, sustainable microfinance on a large scale will take a considerable amount of time.&#13;
VI.    ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS&#13;
107.  Environment and Social Impact Management. The principles governing social and environmental&#13;
management will be applied through an Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework (the&#13;
Framework). The Framework is applicable to all activities financed under the proposed Project, and&#13;
includes: (i) key policy principles for social and environmental management; (ii) tools to help screen&#13;
subprojects for significant social and environmental impacts, and to help mitigate such impacts; (iii)&#13;
procedures to ensure that these principles and tools are appropriately applied; and (iv) guidelines for&#13;
capacity-building and monitoring. The Framework will be operationalized through the proposed project's&#13;
arrangements for implementation, capacity building and monitoring.&#13;
23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
108.  No activities will be supported that require involuntary land acquisition, or the acquisition of land&#13;
requiring the resettlement or compensation of more than 200 people. Consequently no Resettlement&#13;
Action Plan will be required for the proposed project. The voluntary donation or compensated&#13;
contribution of land for subproject activities will be guided by the "Guidelines for Land and Asset&#13;
Acquisition, Entitlements and Compensation" included in the Framework.&#13;
109.   Given the nature of the operation (being processed under OP 8.50 Emergency Recovery&#13;
Assistance) and the proposed activities for Bank financing, an exemption has been obtained from the&#13;
requirement to make the Framework publicly available prior to appraisal. The Framework will be made&#13;
publicly available in Afghanistan and in the World Bank's Info Shop prior to presentation of the proposed&#13;
project to the World Bank Board.&#13;
110.  No significant environmental impacts are anticipated. Village level subprojects built through the&#13;
project will all be small, and for the most part will involve items such as road, bridge, and canal repair,&#13;
shallow wells for clean water, facilities repair and construction, etc. For these items, environmental&#13;
concerns will be addressed through the project's technical manual and supervision. Environmental&#13;
screening will be carried out through the proposal review process, and environmental management will be&#13;
part of the oversight teams' training and terms of reference. Larger-scale infrastructure, would be referred&#13;
to the district engineer for environmental review. Terms of reference for preparing the environmental&#13;
screening procedures that are extracted from relevant sections of the Environment and Social Safeguards&#13;
Framework will be incorporated into the Operational Manual.&#13;
111.  No involuntary land acquisition is anticipated. Project technical manuals for physical works will&#13;
require ex ante certification that subprojects do not involved involuntary land acquisition. A land&#13;
acquisition process framework acceptable to the Bank was appraised and is being incorporated into the&#13;
project's Operational manual.&#13;
112.   Bank policy objectives for ethnic minorities are met by the design of the project itself, which&#13;
provides all decision-making power and resources directly to local communities. There are, however,&#13;
likely to be some areas where within-village stratification prevents minorities from full participation in&#13;
decision-making. A second topic raised by the government is that the proposed design is not going to be&#13;
applicable in areas inhabited by non-resident nomadic populations. They will not be adversely affected&#13;
by the project, but, though poor, they will not be main beneficiaries from it either.&#13;
113.   Both topics will be monitored closely and addressed on a case by case basis using specialized&#13;
facilitators and independent monitoring by social scientists and indigenous organizations, where these&#13;
exist. Of special concern is to identify a possible investment program for the nomadic groups.&#13;
Experience with nomadic populations elsewhere, however, shows that great care is needed with such&#13;
programs because of their highly fragile ecology.&#13;
114.   Reviewing opportunities to provide resources to minority communities will be part of the 6 month&#13;
review, which will also build on ongoing consultations with community representatives in such areas as&#13;
these are identified. Hazara populations living in NE Afghanistan are of particular concern. Singled out&#13;
for repression by the Taliban and currently suffering from both closed borders with China and&#13;
Turkmenistan and the 4 year drought, Hazara communities have recently begun forming self-help&#13;
organizations. Appraisal of their capacities and local level support will help IDA and the government&#13;
assess whether these might be appropriate counterparts for developing specialized activities.&#13;

ANNEX 1&#13;
EMERGENCY COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT&#13;
PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
A.     INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY&#13;
The Procurement Agent hired under the IDA Emergency Public Administration Project will assist&#13;
the Government for the procurement of goods, works, and consultancy services and for providing&#13;
guidance to the Ministry on procurement matters for the implementation of community-driven activities.&#13;
In view of the dispersed nature of work to be executed in remote location in a decentralized&#13;
manner, the procurement risk is considered high. Project supervision will include procurement expertise&#13;
in most missions over the life of the IDA Grant. Threshold limits described below have been set in&#13;
accordance with the nature of the project.&#13;
This Project has two parts, each of which has three components discussed separately below:&#13;
Part A: Public Works Program&#13;
Part B: Community Empowerment Program&#13;
B.     PROCUREMENT METHODS&#13;
The procurement arrangements and the estimated costs for the Project components to be funded&#13;
by IDA are shown in Table A. Procurement under the IDA Grant will be carried out in accordance with&#13;
the "Guidelines for Procurement under 1BRD Loans and Credits" (January 1995, revised in January and&#13;
August 1996 and September 1997 and January 1999) and "Guidelines for Selection and Employment of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" (January 1997, revised in September 1997 and January 1999).&#13;
The "Bank's Standard Request for Proposals: Selection of Consultants" (July 1997, revised April 1998&#13;
and July 1999) will be used for consulting services. For the procurement of works and goods, IDA shall&#13;
suggest appropriate bidding documents to be used.&#13;
Part A: The Public Works Program has the following components:&#13;
Component A: Community District Grant Subprojects&#13;
Component B: Technical Assistance for Implementation&#13;
Component C: Monitoring and Preparation of a Longer-term Program Proposal&#13;
Part B: The Community Empowerment Program has the following components:&#13;
Component A: Community Grants&#13;
Component B: Implementation Support&#13;
Component C: Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
Bl.l: Community District Subprojectsfor Part A (US$18.4 million)&#13;
The Grant allocation will be used for labor-intensive roads and irrigation works with relatively&#13;
simple preparation and implementation arrangements. The physical work will be described in the&#13;
approved subproject contract. Community organizations will be responsible for the implementation of&#13;
subprojects for physical works through the procedures as described in paragraph 1.2 below.&#13;
25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Bl.2: Community Sub-Projects for Part B (US$16.0 million)&#13;
This component consists of a Village Subgrant Program in two stages. An initial US$1,000 to&#13;
US$5,000 will be used to launch the community planning process, followed by a longer-term program to&#13;
provide annual grants of US$10,000-20,000 to villages. The subgrants will be used for public&#13;
infrastructure, community assets and revolving funds, social services, and training. Subgrants will be&#13;
transferred directly to a village account although their amounts will be recorded in provincial and district&#13;
budgets as these become operative. The physical work will be described in the approved subproject&#13;
contract. Works will be carried out by community organizations through a community-driven process and&#13;
will adopt the following procedures for physical works in accordance with para. 3.15 of the Bank&#13;
Guidelines.&#13;
For both above subprojects, community organizations will be responsible for implementing&#13;
subprojects through the following procedures for physical works (in accordance with para. 3.15 of the&#13;
Bank Guidelines):&#13;
(i)    Execute the works themselves by employing labor and by procuring the needed materials;&#13;
or&#13;
(ii)  Award the whole or part of work on Direct Contract to community organizations or&#13;
NGOs; or&#13;
(iii)  Award the whole or part of the work to qualified domestic contractors after inviting&#13;
quotations.&#13;
The value of each contract for the Public Works subproject shall not exceed more than&#13;
US$140,000 equivalent, and for the Community Empowerment subproject US$20,000 equivalent.&#13;
B2: Procurement of Goods for Part B (US$1.5 million)&#13;
The procurement of goods will consist of office supplies and equipment, including computers and&#13;
vehicles. Limited International Bidding (LIB), Intemational/National Shopping Procedures (IS/NS),&#13;
procurement through UN Agencies (UN), and Direct Contracting (DC) procedures will be used.&#13;
Limited International Bidding (LIB): This will be used for goods estimated to cost more than&#13;
US$200,000 or equivalent per contract. Bidders will be able to send their request by fax and no bid&#13;
security would be required.&#13;
International/National Shopping: This will be used for goods estimated to cost less than or equal&#13;
to US$200,000 equivalent per contract. Under Shopping procedures, the Procurement Agent will use&#13;
simplified documents and procedures for soliciting, receiving, and evaluating competitive quotation from&#13;
usually at least three suppliers (in International Shopping from two different countries). The shopping&#13;
method to be used will be based on the Bank's Memorandum of June 8, 2000 (Guidance Procurement&#13;
Notes on Handling Procurement under Shopping Methods). In view of the nature of this emergency&#13;
operation, the threshold will be higher than normal limit of US$100,000.&#13;
Direct Contracting (DC) Procedures: This will be used for goods estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$50,000 or equivalent per contract in consultation with IDA.&#13;
B3. 1: Consulting Services and Trainingfor Part A (US$1.0. million)&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Although for consulting services the preferred selection method is "Quality and Cost Based&#13;
Selection" (QCBS), for some major consultancies such as the Project's Management Consultant, who&#13;
needs to be selected as quickly as possible, the method to be used will be Single-Source selection.&#13;
A core team of consultants, consisting of civil engineers who will provide technical support and&#13;
supervision to villagers and small contractors, will be contracted on an individual basis. "Service Delivery&#13;
Contractors" [Para 3.19 of Guidelines] is considered the appropriate selection method. In this case job&#13;
description, minimum qualifications, terms of employment, and selection procedures will be agreed with&#13;
the Bank and the value of each assignment for an individual shall be limited to US$10,000. For major&#13;
consultancies the description, estimated cost, and method of selection will be as follows:&#13;

Selection of Firms, SOEs for Training, Commercial Practices, Service Delivery Contractors etc.&#13;
IDA's clearance of terms of reference and single-source selections will be mandatory irrespective&#13;
of the value of the assignment.&#13;
B3.2: Consulting Services and Trainingfor Part B (US$4.0 million):&#13;
Although for consulting services the preferred selection method is QCBS, some major&#13;
consultancies such as Training Material Design, Dissemination Media, and training management must be&#13;
selected as quickly as possible, and thus the method to be used will be Selection Based on Consultants'&#13;
Qualification (CQ). This means seeking Expressions of Interest (EOIs) based on brief terms of reference,&#13;
and specifying in the EOIs the criteria for establishing a shortlist with a view to select the firm with the&#13;
most appropriate qualifications and references. The selected firm will be asked to submit a combined&#13;
technical-financial proposal before being invited for negotiations. The EOIs for the above consultants will&#13;
be published in the UNDB online version to ensure wide dissemination.&#13;
The largest consultant item for this project is the provision of provincial and district facilitators.&#13;
These consultants will be contracted on an individual basis; "Service Delivery Contractors" [Para 3.19 of&#13;
Guidelines] is considered to be the appropriate method for selection. In this case job description,&#13;
minimum qualification, terms of employment, selection procedures will be agreed to with the Bank and&#13;
the value of each individual assignment will be limited to US$10,000. The largest consultant item for this&#13;
project will be the provision of provincial and district facilitators. These consultants will be contracted on&#13;
27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
individual basis; "Service Delivery Contractors" [Para 3.19 of Guidelines] is considered to be the&#13;
appropriate method for selection.&#13;
The other large consulting contract will be the provision of oversight technical management.&#13;
Because of the Project's rapid start-up, the unique qualification of the project management team and the&#13;
risk of starting the project without having an oversight consultant in place, the Project will directly&#13;
appoint an oversight consultant for the project start-up period (approximately 6 months) as also a Chief&#13;
Financial Officer. At that point the contract will be competitively selected (QBS) covering the services in&#13;
these two areas.&#13;
For major consultancies the description, estimated cost and method of selection are described in&#13;

C.     ASSESSMENT&#13;
Cl.    ASSESSMENT OF MINISTRY OF PUBLIC WORKS, MINISTRY OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT,&#13;
MINISTRY OF IRRIGATION AND AACA'S READINESS TO IMPLEMENT THE PUBLIC WORKS&#13;
PROGRAM&#13;
The actions taken/being taken by the above implementing agencies include:&#13;
*  Temns of reference for (i) Management Consultants, that is, national and international experts&#13;
(engineers, chief financial officers, Information Technology experts) have been finalized; (ii)&#13;
Terms of Reference for the core team of Afghani engineers to provide technical and supervision&#13;
support will be finalized by May 2002.&#13;
*  The format for draft tripartite contracts between community organizations, facilitators, and&#13;
project unit at the provincial level of ministries will be prepared by a govemment-NGO group by&#13;
May 2002.&#13;
C2.    ASSESSMENT   OF   MRRD/AACA's READINESS       TO   IMPLEMENT    THE   COMMUNITY&#13;
EMPOWERMENT PROGRAM&#13;
*  Terms of reference for the appointment of Technical and Social Facilitators have been&#13;
finalized.&#13;
*  The format for draft tripartite contract between community organizations, facilitators, and&#13;
project unit at the provincial level of MRRD has been finalized;&#13;
*  A tentative training plan will be prepared by June 2002, identifying the areas of planning,&#13;
number and types of participants to be trained and names of institutions and resource&#13;
organizations and persons.&#13;
Based on detailed discussions with ministries/AACA it has been found that satisfactory steps&#13;
have been taken to ensure the expeditious start-up of the project.&#13;
D.     PROCUREMENT PLANNING&#13;
Detailed procurement plans and schedules for the community-driven activities cannot be made&#13;
available by the time of appraisal. The Management Consultant and Technical Oversight Consultant, with&#13;
the assistance of the Procurement Agent, will guide the ministry on procurement matters to implement&#13;
community-driven activities. For the Community Empowerment Project, a procurement plan for goods&#13;
and equipment to be procured will be prepared by the Procurement Agent in consultation with&#13;
MRRD/AACA by July 2002.&#13;
E.     PRIOR AND POST REVIEW&#13;
El.    PRIOR AND POST REVIEW FOR PUBLIC WORKS PROGRAM&#13;
The first three contracts and contracts above US$100,000 for community subprojects will be&#13;
subject to prior review. Consulting services contracts above US$100,000 for firmns and above US$50,000&#13;
for individual consultants will be subject to prior review by IDA. All other contracts will be subject to&#13;
post-review on a random basis during supervision missions and audits.&#13;
30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Due to the nature of this operation, the majority of contracts will be below prior review limits. It&#13;
is expected that the project will have about 150 District Grants contracts of upto US$140,000. The project&#13;
provides for audits to be conducted by independent auditors to be hired by ministries or the AACA (or&#13;
Audit Agent of the Government) for expenditures incurred as well as asset verification. In addition, the&#13;
project provides technical audits by independent consultants for community construction works on a&#13;
sample basis. The normal Bank requirement of ex-post review of one in five contracts for an high-risk&#13;
project (about 30 contracts) is expected to be met. In addition to a review of the independent self audit&#13;
reports called for in this project, Bank staff will conduct post-award reviews during supervision missions.&#13;
E2.    PRIOR AND POST REVIEW FOR COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT PROGRAM&#13;
Draft tripartite contract form for community subprojects, contracts for goods in excess of&#13;
US$ 100,000 and the first three contracts for goods, irrespective of value and consulting services contracts&#13;
above US$100,000 for firms and above US$50,000 for individual consultants, will be subject to prior&#13;
review by IDA. All other contracts would be subject to post-review on a random basis during supervision&#13;
missions and audits.&#13;
Due to the nature of this operation, almost all contracts will be below prior review limits. It is&#13;
expected that the project will have 3,000-7,500 contracts at the community subcontracting level, valued&#13;
between US$2,000-5,000. The project itself will provide for a self audit to be conducted by independent&#13;
auditors to be hired by MRRD/AACA for expenditures incurred and asset verification. In addition, the&#13;
project will provide for a technical audit to be carried out by independent consultants for community&#13;
construction works on a sample basis. The normal Bank requirement of ex-post review of one in five&#13;
contracts for a high-risk project (about 1,000 contracts) cannot be achieved in this project due to resource&#13;
and time constraints. Given the sheer number of contracts envisioned in this project, the Bank's resource&#13;
constraints, the mitigating effect of the self-audit and technical audits mentioned above, we would&#13;
consider the "benchmark" review level of 1 in 5 contracts to be excessively large for this type of&#13;
emergency operation. However, MRRD/AACA has agreed to conduct these post-award audit reviews at&#13;
the project level and furnish reports to the IDA. The Bank will review samples of these reports as per the&#13;
regional guidelines. In addition to a review of the independent self-audit reports called for in this project,&#13;
Bank staff will conduct post-award reviews during supervision missions.&#13;
F.     PROCUREMENT INFORMATION&#13;
The Management Consultant assisted by Procurement Agent will prepare procurement&#13;
information that will be collected and recorded as follows:&#13;
1. Prompt reporting of contract award information for the respective components; and&#13;
2. Comprehensive quarterly reports prepared by AACA indicating:&#13;
* revised cost estimates for individual contracts and total cost;&#13;
* revised timings of procurement actions including advertising, bidding, contract award;&#13;
and&#13;
* completion time for individual contracts.&#13;
G.     PROPOSED PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS AND FREQUENCY OF SUPERVISION&#13;
The Project's elements and their estimated costs and proposed methods of procurement are&#13;
summarized in Table A. Consultant Selection Arrangements are given in Paragraph B3 above.&#13;

ANNEX 2&#13;
FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, DISBURSEMENT, AND AUDIT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
Country Issues&#13;
Since there is no Country Profile of Financial Accountability (CPFA) or Country Financial&#13;
Accountability Assessment (CFAA) for Afghanistan, there is inadequate knowledge of country issues and&#13;
related strengths and weaknesses. Financial management capacity in the country is not yet fully&#13;
functional. Mitigation measures taken by the Interim Administration include the engagement of a&#13;
Financial Management Agent under the recently approved IDA-financed Emergency Public&#13;
Administration Project. Under these contracts, two Agents-Financial Management and Audit-are&#13;
responsible for working with the AIA line ministries to carry out these core functions.&#13;
Financial Management Arrangements&#13;
Financial management and audit functions for the proposed project will be undertaken through&#13;
the Financial Management Agents. The Financial Management Agent will be responsible for assisting the&#13;
MOF to maintain the accounts for all Government expenditures, including IDA-financed projects and the&#13;
proposed Project, in addition to building capacity within AIA for these functions. To supplement this&#13;
function, a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) will be engaged to coordinate financial management and&#13;
reporting for the Project. The government's budgeting and accounting systems will be used. Quarterly&#13;
Financial Monitoring Reports will be prepared by the line ministries' accounting units, consolidated by&#13;
the CFO, reviewed and approved by the MOF, and supported by the FM Agent.&#13;
Strengths&#13;
The engagement of the Financial Management Agent, the CFO, and consultants at the provincial&#13;
level, along with the AIA's commitment to transparent and accountable financial management, are&#13;
strengths of the project's financial management system. A second strength is the deployment of at least&#13;
one trained financial specialist per province. Thirdly, the project's program of social controls and&#13;
independent field monitoring by journalists and NGOs will provide additional security that transgressions&#13;
will be discovered.&#13;
Project Staffing&#13;
The CFO (to be recruited through the Project) will support the MOF, the Ministry of Public&#13;
Works (MPW) and the Ministry of Reconstruction and Rural Development (MRRD) to perform the&#13;
Project's necessary financial management functions. At the provincial level, consultants will be engaged&#13;
to assist the provincial- and district-level offices. The Financial Management Agent's services will be&#13;
augmented to support the project, where necessary.&#13;
Accounting Policies and Procedures&#13;
The Project will follow standard AIA financial management policies and procedures, including&#13;
using the AIA Chart of Accounts to record Project expenditures. The use of these procedures will allow&#13;
for adequate recording and reporting of Project expenditures.&#13;
Project expenditure at the provincial level will be maintained by the provincial offices, and&#13;
monthly reports submitted to the AACA. Accounting records will be consolidated centrally by the CFO&#13;
based at the MOF.&#13;
37&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Funds Flow&#13;
The project will use the existing government system as much as possible. As is the practice for&#13;
government expenditure, all project payments will be routed through the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The&#13;
Financial Management Agent will assist the MOF in executing and recording project payments.&#13;
Treasury officials at the MOF will be the authorized persons to operate the USD Special Account&#13;
of the project at the DAB; IDA funds will be deposited into the Special Account. When a project payment&#13;
is required to be made, implementing agencies (line ministries and other government departments) will&#13;
submit a standard payment request to the MOF-Treasury. Treasury officials, after verifying the&#13;
documents and checking the availability of funds in the Special Account and budget will, (a) for&#13;
payments in Afghanis issue a check in Afghanis for encashment at DAB and (b) for a payment in foreign&#13;
currency instruct DAB to execute the payment.&#13;
Project payments to communities at the provincial and district levels will also follow the&#13;
government procedure and will be accounted for by the provincial line ministries and bank accounts at the&#13;
DAB's provincial offices.&#13;
For purposes of funds flow planning, it is important that the Project's CFO, provincial financial&#13;
consultants, FM Agent, MOF-Treasury Officials, and DAB staff closely coordinate, monitor and&#13;
communicate cash flow requirements for project activities.&#13;
Due to reasons related to security, damaged infrastructure, and a breakdown in communication&#13;
between the branches and the Kabul office of DAB, the AIA will face a challenge in effecting payments&#13;
throughout the country. Although not all of DAB's branches currently fully functional, efforts are being&#13;
made to rehabilitate the branches so that the ALA's payment needs throughout the country can be met,&#13;
including making arrangements for secure transport of cash notes around the country. The 30 provincial&#13;
branches needed for the project should be operational prior to disbursements. Salary payments have&#13;
recently been made in 25 of Afghanistan's 32 provinces, and payment systems are being restarted&#13;
throughout the country. In addition, in the short term, there could be a shortage of Afghani currency notes&#13;
within the government.&#13;
Although the AIA and DAB prefer to use the normal payment systems, in the event that DAB&#13;
cannot provide payment services to all required locations, the AIA could resort to alternative systems&#13;
(e.g., Hawala) to effect payments in these locations. If the AIA chooses to use such an alternative system&#13;
for the flow of funds on IDA-financed activities, the implementation mechanisms and risk mitigation&#13;
measures will be agreed with IDA prior to the flow of funds through the alternative system.&#13;
Project Subgrants&#13;
Subgrants to communities will be given at the district and village levels. District grants will be for&#13;
rehabilitation and reconstruction of infrastructure, while village grants, limited to a maximum of&#13;
US$20,000 per village, will be used for srnall-scale community works, revolving funds, and similar&#13;
efforts. Initial disbursements against subgrants will be given as an advance on signing of the contract.&#13;
Subsequent tranches will be based on evidence of the outputs achieved. Provincial line ministries, assisted&#13;
by local consultants, will be responsible for implementing, supervising, and disbursing grant funds.&#13;
Up front, the MOF will be informed by the AACA of the authorized allocation agreed for each&#13;
project village and district following site selection by the districts that are ratified in Kabul. MOF will&#13;
inform the DAB of this allocation. DAB will thereafter inform its provincial branches of these allocations&#13;
and procedures to handle disbursements. MOF authorizes the line ministry departments to manage&#13;
disbursements.&#13;
38&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Project management will determine the amount and timing of the first grant transfer needed&#13;
to each provincial DAB, based on the expected payments under the approved contracts of villages and&#13;
districts. MOF will be informed a week in advance of this projected cash requirement. On MOF&#13;
instructions, DAB will transfer these advances in Afghanis, and will ensure that the transfer take place in&#13;
a timely way, with the physical transfers of money. Subsequent transfers will be handled in a similar way.&#13;
Villages and Districts will receive the first payment on the basis of the contracts signed by the&#13;
districts or villages; the foreman or facilitators, and countersigned by the provincial departmental engineer&#13;
responsible for the project. Disbursement requests are signed by the provincial department head, village&#13;
and the facilitator as proof that prior funds have been used correctly as evidenced by outputs, and that&#13;
further funds should be released. For all payments, the line department will write a check which will be&#13;
signed by the department head and the facilitator, which will be presented to the DAB branch for&#13;
payment. The branch will disburse funds against the check. No further checks can be issued once the&#13;
contract is at zero.&#13;
Local consultants will closely supervise the implementation of sub-grant activities, carryout&#13;
physical verification of outputs reported, and verify the records of the communities. Implementation&#13;
guidelines and criteria for usage of funds will be explained in detail in the Project Manual.&#13;
Audit Arrangements&#13;
The accounts of the Project will be audited by the Auditor General, with the support of the Audit&#13;
Agent, with terms of reference satisfactory to the Association. The annual Project financial statement to&#13;
the Association would include a summary of funds received (showing funds received from all sources),&#13;
and a summary of expenditures shown under the main Project components/ activities and by main&#13;
categories of expenditures. The format of the annual Project financial statements will be similar to the&#13;
Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs). The audit of the Project accounts will also include an assessment&#13;
of: (a) the adequacy of the accounting and internal control systems; (b) the ability to maintain adequate&#13;
documentation for transactions; and (c) the eligibility of incurred expenditures for Association financing.&#13;
The annual Project financial statements, audited by the Auditor General, would be submitted within 6&#13;
months of the close of AIA's fiscal year. The following audit reports will be monitored in the Audit&#13;
Reports Compliance System (ARCS):&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Disbursement Arrangements&#13;
Disbursement Method. Disbursements from the IDA Grant would be transaction-based&#13;
(replenishment, reimbursement, direct payment, and payments under Special Comnuitments) with full&#13;
documentation or against statements of expenditures as appropriate. All withdrawal applications to the&#13;
IDA, including replenishment, reimbursement and direct payment applications, will be prepared and&#13;
submitted by the MOF.&#13;

Total                  33,700,000&#13;
Financing Percentage. Since collection of tax revenue has just begun and is sporadic,&#13;
disbursement percentages have been set at 100 percent, with the understanding that MOF will submit&#13;
withdrawal applications on a net-of-tax basis. The AIA's tax structure will be reviewed within 6 months&#13;
of Grant signing, at which time standard disbursement percentages will be set and financing percentages&#13;
amended accordingly.&#13;
Retroactive Financing. Provision has been made to reimburse AIA for payments it makes, up to&#13;
SDR 600,000, between April 1, 2002 and Grant signing, for expenditures under Categories 3-A, 3-B, 4-A,&#13;
and 4-B.&#13;
Disbursement Method. Disbursements from the IDA Grant would be transaction-based&#13;
(replenishment, reimbursement, direct payment, and payments under Special Commitments) with full&#13;
documentation or against SOEs as appropriate.&#13;
Use of statements of expenditures. Disbursements will be made on the basis of SOEs for: (a)&#13;
consultants and training for contracts not exceeding US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for&#13;
individuals; and (b) goods for contracts not exceeding US$250,000; (c) subgrants, and (d) incremental&#13;
operating costs.&#13;
Special Account. A Special Account will be opened and maintained in a bank acceptable to the&#13;
Association; and will be operated by MOF in accordance with the Association's operational policies. The&#13;
Authorized Allocation of the Special Account would be US$4.5 million which represents the estimated&#13;
amount of expenditures to course through the Special Account in a 3-month period. Given the short&#13;
disbursement period and the immediate need for special account funds, the full amount of the Authorized&#13;
Allocation of the Special Account will be available to MOF upon effectiveness. In order to meet&#13;
immediate cash needs, MOF may convert Special Account funds into Afghani for distribution to&#13;
provinces outside Kabul. Such advances will be limited to estimates of the cash needs for a 30-day period&#13;
and must be reconciled within 90 days of disbursement from the Special Account.&#13;
40&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Minimum application size. Applications for replenishment to the Special Account will be&#13;
submitted (a) monthly, or (2) when the Special Account balance is reduced by 40 percent, whichever&#13;
comes first. The minimum application size for withdrawal applications for reimbursement, direct&#13;
payment, or for applications for Special Commitments is 20 percent of the Authorized Allocation of the&#13;
Special Account. In the event that banking facilities are not fully functional at the time of Grant&#13;
effectiveness, IDA may, on an exceptional basis, waive minimum application size requirements in order&#13;
to accommodate urgent needs.&#13;
Authority to withdraw Grant funds. MOF will retain the right to sign and submit withdrawal&#13;
applications to the Association.&#13;
Legal Conditions&#13;
* Appointment of provincial-level financial consultants to support the provincial line ministries prior to&#13;
disbursement of subgrants in that province.&#13;
Disbursement of Subgrants&#13;
*  Appointment of a Chief Financial Officer&#13;
* Project Manual acceptable to the IDA&#13;
Supervision Plan&#13;
The Project will need intensive supervision. The focus during the supervision will be on the internal&#13;
control arrangements for the Project and functioning of accounting, financial reporting, and auditing.&#13;

ANNEX 4&#13;
ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS FRAMEWORK&#13;
I.     Objectives&#13;
The Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework provides general policies, guidelines,&#13;
codes of practice and procedures to be integrated into the implementation of World Bank supported&#13;
emergency reconstruction operations in Afghanistan. Consistent with existing national legislation, the&#13;
objective of the Framework is to help ensure that activities under the proposed reconstruction operations&#13;
will:&#13;
*      Protect human health;&#13;
*      Prevent or compensate any loss of livelihood;&#13;
*      Prevent environmental degradation as a result of either individual subprojects or their cumulative&#13;
effects;&#13;
*      Enhance positive environmental and social outcomes; and,&#13;
*      Ensure compliance with World Bank safeguard policies.&#13;
II.    General Principles&#13;
Recognizing the emergency nature of the proposed relief and reconstruction operations, and the&#13;
related need for providing immediate assistance, while at the same time ensuring due diligence in&#13;
managing potential environmental and social risks, this Framework is based on the following principles:&#13;
1. The proposed operations will support multiple subprojects, the detailed designs of which may not&#13;
be known at appraisal. To ensure the effective application of the World Bank's safeguard&#13;
policies, the Framework provides guidance on the approach to be taken during implementation&#13;
for the selection and design of subprojects, and the planning of mitigation measures;&#13;
2. The proposed emergency reconstruction operations will not support environmental Category A&#13;
subprojects', nor subprojects requiring land acquisition affecting 200 or more people.&#13;
Consequently, no Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) or Resettlement Action Plans&#13;
(RAPs) will be required. With the exception of support for the emergency rehabilitation of the&#13;
Kabul North-West power plant, no subprojects requiring separate, site-specific environmental or&#13;
social reports will be supported. With this exception, all proposed subprojects will be screened to&#13;
ensure that the environmental and social risks can be adequately addressed through the&#13;
application of standardized guidelines and codes of practice;&#13;
3. Activities requiring a more detailed level of assessment, such as those entailing the construction&#13;
or installation of new or significantly expanded infrastructure, will be supported under subsequent&#13;
operations. The proposed emergency reconstruction operations will finance feasibility and&#13;
detailed design studies for these subsequent investments, which will include environmental and&#13;
social impact assessments as required by World Bank safeguard policies;&#13;
4. Project design and subproject selection will aim to maintain regional balance, and equity between&#13;
genders, and ethnic and religious groups, considering variations in population density.&#13;
Employment opportunities within the projects will be available on an equal basis to all, on the&#13;
basis of professional competence, irrespective of gender, or ethnic or religious group. In all&#13;
projects which require consultations with local communities or beneficiaries, gender-separated&#13;
2 As defined in World Bank Operational Policy 4.01, Environmental Assessment.&#13;
44&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
consultations will be conducted to elicit the views of the female population, along with that of the&#13;
male population; and,&#13;
5. Consultation and disclosure requirements will be simplified to meet the special needs of these&#13;
operations. Prior to approval by the World Bank Board, this Enviromnental and Social&#13;
Safeguards Framework will be disclosed in Afghanistan in Dari and Pashto, and in the World&#13;
Bank Infoshop.&#13;
m.     Safeguard Screening and Mitigation&#13;
The selection, design, contracting, monitoring and evaluation of subprojects will be consistent&#13;
with the following guidelines, codes of practice and requirements:&#13;
*      A negative list of characteristics that would make a proposed subproject ineligible for support, as&#13;
indicated in Attachment 1;&#13;
*      Guidelines for land and asset acquisition, entitlements and compensation, presented in&#13;
Attachment 2;&#13;
*      Procedures for the protection of cultural property, including the chance discovery of&#13;
archaeological artifacts, and unrecorded graveyards and burial sites, provided in Attachment 3;&#13;
*      Relevant elements of the codes of practice for the mitigation of potential environmental impacts,&#13;
presented in Attachment 4; and,&#13;
*      The requirement that confirmation is received through the Regional Mine Action Center that&#13;
areas to be accessed during reconstruction and rehabilitation activities have been demined.&#13;
In addition to these requirements, an environmental audit will be conducted as part of feasibility&#13;
study and detailed design for the rehabilitation of the Kabul North-West power plant.&#13;
IV.    Responsibilities for Safeguard Screening and Mitigation&#13;
A number of Ministries will act as the implementing agencies for the proposed operations,&#13;
including the Ministries of Reconstruction and Rural Development, Public Works, Power, and Housing,&#13;
Planning and Building. Each Ministry will be responsible for applying the safeguard screening and&#13;
mitigation requirements to its own subprojects.&#13;
Within each Ministry, a Safeguards Focal Point will be identified with responsibility for&#13;
overseeing the implementation of the Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework.&#13;
V.     Capacity Building And Monitoring Of Safeguard Framework Implementation&#13;
As part of the capacity building that will be provided for implementation of the proposed&#13;
operations, the Safeguards Focal Points and relevant staff of the concerned Ministries will also receive&#13;
training in the application of the Safeguard Framework.&#13;
To assist in this capacity building, and to provide subsequent guidance and review of the&#13;
application of the Framework, GoA will contract specialist social and environmental services. During&#13;
supervision of these operations, the World Bank will assess the implementation of the Framework, and if&#13;
required will recommend additional strengthening.&#13;
VI.    Consultation and Disclosure&#13;
This Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework was prepared in consultation with the&#13;
principal NGOs and development partners participating in reconstruction activities in Afghanistan. It will&#13;
45&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
be disclosed by GoA in both Dari and Pashto, as well as English, and it will also be made available at the&#13;
World Bank's Infoshop.&#13;
The environmental audit to be prepared for the rehabilitation of the Kabul North-West thermal&#13;
power station will be made publicly available by GoA, and at the World Bank Infoshop. Since no other&#13;
separate environmental or social assessments will be prepared for activities under the proposed&#13;
reconstruction operations, no additional disclosure requirements will apply. In this regard, however, it is&#13;
worth noting that GoA intends to make all project documentation publicly available through the Afghan&#13;
Information Management System (AIMS).&#13;
The proposed operations will support a number of feasibility and detailed design studies for&#13;
future infrastructure investments, for which World Bank safeguard policies relating to consultation and&#13;
disclosure will apply. In particular, for environmental Category A and B investments3 proposed for future&#13;
operations, the implementing agency will consult project-affected groups and local nongovernmental&#13;
organizations about the project's environmental and social aspects, and will take their views into account.&#13;
The implementing agency will initiate such consultations as early as possible, and for meaningful&#13;
consultations, will provide relevant material in a timely manner prior to consultation, in a form and&#13;
language that are understandable and accessible to the groups being consulted.&#13;
For Category A projects, the implementing agency will consult these groups at least twice, (i)&#13;
shortly after environmental screening and before the terms of reference for the Environmental Impact&#13;
Assessment (EIA) are finalized, and (ii) once a draft EIA report is prepared. For the initial consultation,&#13;
the implementing agency will provide a summary of the proposed project's objectives, description, and&#13;
potential impacts. For both Category A and B projects, the implementing agency will provide these&#13;
groups with a summary of the EIA report's conclusions. In addition, the implementing agency will make&#13;
the draft reports available at a public place accessible to project-affected groups and local NGOs.&#13;

            Afghanistan - Emergency Community
            Empowerment and Public Works Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Emergency Community Empowerment and
            Public Works Project aims at providing employment in rural
            areas at a minimum wage, as a safety net, to as many people,
            and in short a time as may be possible. Furthermore, the
            project will commence the process of helping villages
            rebuild their capital base through the provision of
            sub-grants, and empower villagers to plan for, and decide
            on, the investments to be made with the proceeds of the
            sub-grants. The grant will finance oversight consultants for
            both the labor-intensive works, and community grants;
            rehabilitation of provincial and district roads, and
            irrigation infrastructure; block grants to villages and
            neighborhoods; and, vehicles provision. Services will be
            provided to monitor the program, manage financial flows,
            record-keeping and audits, and, to carry out evaluation,
            institutional, impact, and follow-up studies. Needless to
            say, implementation difficulties due to conditions in the
            country are risks, that include security problems, lack of
            legal and regulatory systems, and, a weak and distorted
            market for skilled labor. However, project benefits - beyond
            labor opportunities - will far outnumber those risks.
