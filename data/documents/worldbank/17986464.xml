           Interview by: Robert W. Oliver&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         1&#13;

&#13;
OLIVER: This is Robert Oliver, Tuesday, October 7, about to begin a telephone&#13;
interview with Mrs. Pat Oliver, Viola Oliver, sister of Louise Taraldson Woods. Where&#13;
and when were you and your sister, Louise, born?&#13;
&#13;
VIOLA: She was born in 1904. I was born in 1906. There were fourteen months&#13;
between us. We are born in North Dakota. My father died when I was 6 and we lived in&#13;
Minneapolis. He had multiple sclerosis. He lost control of his legs and arms. Our&#13;
mother raised us from then. She managed an apartment house for years and raised us that&#13;
way. Then we moved to Long Beach, California. We went to school there, Polytechnic&#13;
High, and graduated from there. Our mother lived by buying and selling apartment&#13;
houses.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: May we just back up just a little bit? May I ask you to say a word about what&#13;
life you were aware of in South Dakota, when you moved to Minnesota, and how long&#13;
you lived in Minnesota?&#13;
&#13;
VIOLA: I think we moved to Minneapolis when I was about 5 years old, and then my&#13;
father died when I was 6 years old. Then we moved to California. We lived out on 8th&#13;
Street in Long Beach for a while. Mama went into the apartment house business, buying&#13;
and selling apartment houses. We would live in one for a while and then she would sell it&#13;
and buy another one. She did that all her life. We had a very nice life. She was a good&#13;
mother. She never married again.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Were both your father and mother born in the United States?&#13;
&#13;
VIOLA: My father was born in Lime Springs, Iowa. I think my mother was born up in&#13;
Edmonton, Canada, but Iâ&#128;&#153;m not real sure about that.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I have the impression that the family background is Scandinavian. Is that&#13;
right?&#13;
&#13;
VIOLA: We were Scotch-Irish and Norwegian.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: That is a very good combination.&#13;
&#13;
VIOLA: That is what I always say. That is where I got my good disposition!&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: What business was your father in?&#13;
&#13;
VIOLA: I think he was in insurance. Iâ&#128;&#153;m not sure whether it was Prudential or not, but&#13;
he sold insurance. They couldnâ&#128;&#153;t have been married very long. I was only six years old&#13;
when he passed away. When Louise was about 20 years old, she moved to New York,&#13;
and then she met George Woods. When you are that far away you donâ&#128;&#153;t know dates.&#13;
Thatâ&#128;&#153;s me, anyway. They got married and had a wonderful life.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I think they did.&#13;
&#13;
VIOLA: She was a fantastic person.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I think she lived for a short time in England before she settled down in New&#13;
York.&#13;
&#13;
VIOLA: When she was in New York, she was head of the International Institute of&#13;
Education for about 2 sessions. We have a nice write up about her from them.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Could you say a word about her going to England?&#13;
&#13;
VIOLA: No, not much.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Her passport indicates that she lived in England for maybe eighteen months,&#13;
and that she was married in England.&#13;
&#13;
VIOLA: Well, that was a long time ago. I donâ&#128;&#153;t really know very much about that. I&#13;
forget. Iâ&#128;&#153;m getting to the age that I forget. She and George were married in 1930 or&#13;
something.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Yes, I think late â&#128;&#153;33 or early â&#128;&#153;34.&#13;
&#13;
VIOLA: They had a marvelous life together. Louise traveled all over with him. She&#13;
liked to travel because she could speak French and Spanish, and talk when they went to&#13;
international meetings. She would be able to carry on a conversation with them. George&#13;
was always amused by that, because he couldnâ&#128;&#153;t speak other languages. Then they&#13;
bought that house in Portugal about 20-25 years ago. I guess they were married between&#13;
1934 and 1936, and, during that time, she was head of the International Institute of&#13;
Education. I have some letters to her.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: If you have anything that you would care to send me, Iâ&#128;&#153;d be happy to Xerox a&#13;
copy for myself and send it back to you.&#13;
&#13;
VIOLA: Iâ&#128;&#153;ll go over them again. Do I have your address?&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: No, Iâ&#128;&#153;ll give it to you.&#13;
&#13;
VIOLA: How do you spell your name?&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Robert Oliver. Professor Robert Oliver. You should be able to get the last&#13;
name right! Would you say a word about Louiseâ&#128;&#153;s hobbies when she was growing up? I&#13;
have the impression that she liked to swim, for example, and dance.&#13;
&#13;
VIOLA: You know everybody does that. She wasnâ&#128;&#153;t an avid sportsman, as I recall, but&#13;
everybody swims, donâ&#128;&#153;t they?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Everybody in Long Beach does, but not everyone in Pasadena does. Weâ&#128;&#153;re&#13;
too far from the water!&#13;
&#13;
VIOLA: Unless they have a pool in their back yards.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Were the two of you pretty close to each other as friends when you were&#13;
growing up?&#13;
&#13;
VIOLA: We were always friends, and she would come out and visit us occasionally. In&#13;
the last few years, she didnâ&#128;&#153;t get out very much. On our way to Europe, we stopped and&#13;
saw her for about a week, but other than that I didnâ&#128;&#153;t get back too often.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Sure, I understand. How did you meet your husband?&#13;
&#13;
VIOLA: Well, I knew him. This is our second marriage. I knew his wife and son, and&#13;
when she passed away, we started going together. That was about 35 years ago.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Was he living on Lido Island at the time?&#13;
&#13;
VIOLA: No, Claremont.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Were you living on Lido Island at the time?&#13;
&#13;
VIOLA: No, Long Beach, California. Yes, Georgeâ&#128;&#153;s father died on a hunting trip. He&#13;
was only 42.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: That is very sad.&#13;
&#13;
VIOLA: I was a widow about 5 or 6 years. Then Patâ&#128;&#153;s wife passed away, and we just&#13;
started going together. We lived in Claremont for about 5 years, up in Padua Hills.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I used to live in Padua Hills in 1951 and 1952.&#13;
&#13;
VIOLA: Well, we were probably there at the same time. We, 1951-1957.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s quite possible. I was a new Assistant Professor at Pomona College in&#13;
those days.&#13;
&#13;
VIOLA: We lived in Padua Hills. We built a home there, a beautiful home, half way up&#13;
the hill. Right above Stewart.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: You must have been close neighbors of Will and Molly Jones?&#13;
&#13;
VIOLA: Yes. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right; he was down on the curve. We built that ranch house that&#13;
was closeâ&#128;&#148;bless his heart, he was a wonderful artist.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Millard Sheets.&#13;
&#13;
VIOLA: He was there, too, down at the end of the road. He was on the curve of the&#13;
road.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: Albert Stewart?&#13;
&#13;
VIOLA: He was there when we were there. What a wonderful artist. We lived there&#13;
about 7 years, and then we moved to Lido Isle. I donâ&#128;&#153;t remember the date. Isnâ&#128;&#153;t that&#13;
awful? 1957. If I can think of anything, Iâ&#128;&#153;ll drop it to you. Will you send me your&#13;
address?&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I surely will.&#13;
&#13;
VIOLA: You gave me your address.&#13;
