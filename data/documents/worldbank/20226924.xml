1.1    The Bank shall be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set forth in this&#13;
Administration Agreement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the Donors,&#13;
including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee&#13;
under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Administration Agreement shall be&#13;
considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its Articles of Agreement or any&#13;
applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2    Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") shall be administered in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended from time to time,&#13;
including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard policies, its framework to&#13;
prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to prevent the use of Bank resources to&#13;
finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the relevant decisions of the&#13;
Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the of Charter of the United Nations. The Donors acknowledge&#13;
that this provision does not create any obligations of the Bank under the anti-terrorist financing and asset&#13;
control laws, regulations, rules and executive orders of an individual member country that may apply to a&#13;
Donor.&#13;
2.     Management of the Contributions&#13;

separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be commingled&#13;
with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in its capacity as trustee, has legal title to the&#13;
funds deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;

Administration Agreements. In the case of deposits received in a Contribution Currency other than the&#13;
Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying Deposit Instructions,&#13;
the Bank shall convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on&#13;
the date of the conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to complete activities as a result of&#13;
exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the Donor shall bear any responsibility for providing any&#13;
additional financing.&#13;
2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other currencies as&#13;
may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the conversion.&#13;
2.5    The Bank shall invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending their disbursement&#13;
in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the investment of trust funds&#13;
administered by the Bank. The Bank shall credit all income from such investment to the Trust Fund to be&#13;
used for the same purposes as the Contributions.&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿3.     Trust Fund Fees and Costs&#13;

Trust Fund administration, that are (i) not covered by the percentage deduction specified above as an&#13;
administrative fee and (ii) not included under Annex I of the Administration Agreements in accordance with&#13;
the Bank's applicable policies and procedures shall be charged to the Trust Fund on an actual basis up to a&#13;
maximum of five percent (5%) of the total Contributions under all Administration Agreements.&#13;
3.3    Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this Trust Fund Fees&#13;
and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions.  If actual Contributions&#13;
significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of the first Administration&#13;
Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change, the Bank reserves the right to&#13;
request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would be effectuated by&#13;
amendments made to the Administration Agreements of all Donors and which would thereafter be applicable&#13;
to all new Contributions that are provided either as amendments to supplement existing Administration&#13;
Agreements or from new Donors under new Administration Agreements.&#13;

concerning the adequacy of internal control over cash-based financial reporting for all cash-based trust funds&#13;
as a whole; and (ii) a combined financial statement for all cash-based trust funds together with the Bank's&#13;
external auditor's opinion thereon. The cost of the single audit shall be borne by the Bank.&#13;
4.4   If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by the Bank's&#13;
external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank shall first consult as to whether such an external&#13;
audit is necessary. If such an audit is agreed to be necessary and if all donors to the Trust Fund concur with&#13;
the relevant Donor's request for such an audit, the Bank and the Donor shall agree on the appropriate scope&#13;
and terms of reference of such audit. Following agreement on the scope and terms of reference, the Bank&#13;
shall arrange for such external audit. The costs of any such audit, including the internal costs of the Bank&#13;
with respect to such audit, shall be borne by the requesting Donor.&#13;
4.5    The Bank shall make available to the Donors copies of all financial statements and auditors' reports&#13;

conduct of such review or evaluation, and the Bank shall provide all relevant information within the limits of&#13;
the Bank's applicable policies and procedures. All associated costs, including any costs incurred by the&#13;
Bank, shall be borne by the Donor. It is understood that any such review or evaluation will not constitute a&#13;
financial, compliance or other audit of the Trust Fund.&#13;
6.     Disbursement; Cancellation; Refund&#13;
6.1   It is expected that the funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be fully disbursed by the Bank by June&#13;

for the purposes of this Administration Agreement (other than returns to Donors) after such date to the extent&#13;

Donors. Following the End Disbursement Date, the Bank shall return any remaining balance of the Trust&#13;
Fund to each Donor in the Holding Currency in the manner specified in its respective Administration&#13;
Agreement on a pro rata basis with regard to the total funds deposited in the Trust Fund by such Donor&#13;

and/or other third parties for the purposes of this Administration Agreement, including any Grant&#13;
Agreements, prior to the receipt of such notice. In the event of a cancellation, the Bank shall return to the&#13;
Donor its pro-rata share in the Holding Currency as specified in the Administration Agreement, unless&#13;
otherwise agreed between the Bank and the Donor.&#13;
7.     Disclosure; Dispute Resolution&#13;
7.1    The Bank shall disclose the Administration Agreements and related information on this Trust Fund&#13;
in accordance with the Bank's Policy on Access to Information. By entering into Administration&#13;
Agreements, the Donors consent to such disclosure of their respective Administration Agreements and such&#13;
related information.&#13;
7.2    The Donors and the Bank shall use their best efforts to amicably settle any dispute, controversy, or&#13;

effecting any such modification or exercising any such remedy.&#13;
10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿ANNEX 3&#13;
Governance&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all Administration Agreements between the&#13;
Bank and the respective Donors.&#13;
As envisioned by the Somali Compact (as defined in Annex 1), overall governance of the Trust Fund shall be&#13;
provided through the SDRF (as defined in Annex 1), including its Steering Committee, which provides&#13;
coordinated purview over multiple funding vehicles, including the Trust Fund. The Donors acknowledge&#13;
and agree that the intention is for development financing for Somalia to increasingly transition towards the&#13;
SDRF as a preferred channel for strategic prioritization and coordination of assistance to Somalia.&#13;
The SDRF Steering Committee governance terms are currently described in the terms of reference ("TORs-)&#13;
adopted by the SDRF Steering Committee on December 11, 2013. The Parties acknowledge and agree that&#13;
these TORs are preliminary governance terms that will be reviewed and revised over time as part of an&#13;
ongoing dialogue in Somalia and to enable flexible adaptation to changing conditions.&#13;
The governance terms applicable to the Trust Fund shall at all times be those applicable to the SDRF, as such&#13;
terms may be amended or otherwise agreed by the SDRF Steering Committee (or its replacement over time),&#13;
provided that any such governance terms are acceptable to the Bank in its role as trustee (the "Governance&#13;
Terms").  The Parties further acknowledge and agree that the Governance Terms, at the time of&#13;
establishment of the Trust Fund as they may be amended through the SDRF over time, shall be applicable to&#13;
this Administration Agreement with effect as of the date agreed within the SDRF without needing additional&#13;
amendments or signatures under this Administration Agreement.&#13;
The Trust Fund is established and shall proceed under the TORs with the following expectations of the&#13;
Parties for future inclusion in or clarification of the Governance Terms:&#13;
1. The Bank shall, in connection with any prior consultations, look to the SDRF as the platform for&#13;
programmatic decision making related to the Trust Fund.&#13;
2. Decision making for the SDRF Steering Committee shall at all times be based on consensus. Consensus&#13;
need not reflect unanimity. A dissenting decision maker that does not wish to block a decision may&#13;
nonetheless state an objection to be recorded in the meeting minutes (or by written statement for electronic&#13;
decision making), in either case clarifying whether the statement is for the record only or intended to&#13;
preclude agreement. The Chair articulates the consensus view. Consensus on decisions affecting the Trust&#13;
Fund must include agreement of the Bank.&#13;
3. Decision making for the SDRF Steering Committee shall at all times be fully representative of all Donors&#13;
to the Trust Fund, whether directly or indirectly. Full Donor representation on the SDRF Executive Steering&#13;
Committee (or its replacement over time) shall be indirect, such as through rotational seats under the current&#13;
TORs. All Donors to SDRF funding vehicles, including the Trust Fund, shall decide amongst themselves&#13;
how to allocate such seats and constituency representation to ensure full donor representation.&#13;
4. Fair and transparent processes shall be used for the selection of civil society and regional representatives&#13;
and the determination of constituency relationships. Membership matters shall at all times be subject to&#13;
oversight by the SDRF Plenary Steering Committee (or its replacement over time).&#13;
5. Implementation under the Trust Fund shall at all times be in accordance with the Bank's Articles of&#13;
Agreement, policies and procedures ("Operating Terms"). This includes the requirement that any grants&#13;
provided under the Trust Fund shall have received prior consent from the Federal Government of Somalia&#13;
11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿("FGS"), including potential framework approaches agreed with the FGS to enable regional balance.&#13;
Common monitoring, reporting, risk management or other standards, formats or requirements may be agreed&#13;
within the SDRF with applicability to the Trust Fund, provided that the Bank shall have expressly agreed to&#13;
such terms. In the event of conflict between the Bank's Operating Terms and any terms made applicable to&#13;
the Trust Fund through the SDRF, the Bank's Operating Terms shall prevail.&#13;
6. A results framework and a risk framework for the Trust Fund will both be developed in the context of the&#13;
SDRF Operations Manual, as well as SDRF procedures for identifying and processing projects, all of which&#13;
may be reviewed and revised over time by the SDRF Steering Committee and shall neither augment the&#13;
rights or obligations in the Administration Agreement nor otherwise have legal effect, but they will be used&#13;
to enable meaningful progress reporting and evaluations. Progress reporting under the Administration&#13;
Agreement will reflect the SDRF-agreed results framework.&#13;
7. The Aid Coordination Unit ("ACU") housing the Secretariat of the SDRF shall be sponsored by the FGS&#13;
for purposes of providing support to the governing bodies of the SDRF without becoming involved in project&#13;
implementation or Trustee functions under the Trust Fund. Support provided by the Bank to the ACU shall at&#13;
all times be mindful of the distinction between the ACU's role relative to the Bank's fiduciary and&#13;
supervisory role under its applicable policies and procedures.&#13;
8. It is understood that donors may at their initiative and in their discretion decide to convene as a group&#13;
apart from the SDRF. Such separate convenings are expected to enable coordination that supports the&#13;
SDRF.&#13;
9. Any oversight functions of the SDRF shall not include oversight of the Trustee and Trust Fund&#13;
operations, which shall remain at all times under Bank oversight.&#13;
10. Any dispute resolution mechanism developed for the SDRF shall not affect the Bank's operation of the&#13;
Trust Fund or create any liability for the Trustee.&#13;
The Parties recognize that the above expectations are not fully articulated, agreed or operative as part of the&#13;
governance of the SDRF, which includes government and other participants. It is understood that failure on&#13;
the part of the SDRF to reach consensus along the lines of the above expectations may be grounds for the&#13;
Trustee to adjust its participation in the Trust Fund and the SDRF.&#13;
For clarity, the Somali Compact serves as a backdrop for the SDRF and by extension the Trust Fund without&#13;
having direct legal effect on this Administration Agreement. In the event of conflict between this&#13;
Administration Agreement and the Somali Compact, or any other document relating to the SDRF, this&#13;
Administration Agreement shall prevail.&#13;
