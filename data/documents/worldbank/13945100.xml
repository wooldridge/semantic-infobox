 PURPOSE&#13;
&#13;
 The International Finance Corporation (IFC), an international organization, was established in 1956 to further economic development in its&#13;
 member countries by encouraging the growth of private enterprise. IFC is a member of the World Bank Group, which also comprises the&#13;
 International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Development Association (IDA), the Multilateral Investment&#13;
 Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). Each member is legally and financially&#13;
 independent. Transactions with other World Bank Group members are disclosed in the notes that follow.IFC's activities are closely coordinated&#13;
 with and complement the overall development objectives of the other World Bank Group institutions. IFC, together with private investors, assists&#13;
 in financing the establishment, improvement and expansion of private sector enterprises by making loans and equity investments where sufficient&#13;
 private capital is not otherwise available on reasonable terms. IFC's share capital is provided by its member countries. It raises most of the funds&#13;
 for its investment activities through the issuance of notes, bonds and other debt securities in the international capital markets. IFC also plays a&#13;
 catalytic role in mobilizing additional project funding from other investors and lenders, either through cofinancing or through loan participations,&#13;
 underwritings and guarantees. In addition to project finance and resource mobilization, IFC offers an array of financial and technical advisory&#13;
 services to private businesses in the developing world to increase their chances of success. It also advises governments on how to create an&#13;
 environment hospitable to the growth of private enterprise and foreign investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 NOTE A ­ SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND RELATED POLICIES&#13;
&#13;
 The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of IFC, three subsidiaries, and two variable interest entities (VIEs) (see&#13;
 Note W). The accounting and reporting policies of IFC conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US&#13;
 GAAP). On August 5, 2009, the Board of Directors of IFC (the Board) approved these consolidated financial statements for issue. Following the&#13;
 Board's approval of these consolidated financial statements, IFC has evaluated subsequent events through August 5, 2009, the date of issue.&#13;
&#13;
 Consolidated financial statements presentation ­ As discussed more fully in Note Y to IFC's consolidated financial statements as of and for&#13;
 the year ended June 30, 2008, during the year ended June 30, 2008, IFC restated previously reported results for the year ended June 30, 2007.&#13;
 In addition, certain amounts in the prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.&#13;
&#13;
 Functional currency ­ IFC's functional currency is the United States dollar (US dollars or $).&#13;
&#13;
 Use of estimates ­ The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that&#13;
 affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial&#13;
 statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. A&#13;
 significant degree of judgment has been used in the determination of: the reserve against losses on loans and impairment of equity investments;&#13;
 estimated fair values of financial instruments accounted for at fair value (including equity investments, debt securities, loans, trading securities&#13;
 and derivative instruments) and net periodic pension income or expense. There are inherent risks and uncertainties related to IFC's operations.&#13;
 The possibility exists that changing economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the financial position of IFC.&#13;
&#13;
 IFC uses internal models to determine the fair values of derivative and other financial instruments and the aggregate level of the reserve against&#13;
 losses on loans and impairment of equity investments. IFC undertakes continuous review and respecification of these models with the objective&#13;
 of refining its estimates, consistent with evolving best practices appropriate to its operations. Changes in estimates resulting from refinements in&#13;
 the assumptions and methodologies incorporated in the models are reflected in net income in the period in which the enhanced models are first&#13;
 applied.&#13;
&#13;
 Fair Value Option and Fair Value Measurements ­ Effective July, 1, 2007, IFC adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB)&#13;
 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157) and SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value&#13;
 Option of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS No. 159 or the Fair Value Option). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a&#13;
 framework for measuring fair value and a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into&#13;
 three broad levels and applies to all items measured at fair value, including items for which impairment measures are based on fair value. SFAS&#13;
 No. 159 permits the measurement of eligible financial assets, financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value on an instrument-by-&#13;
 instrument basis, that are not otherwise permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards. The election to use the&#13;
 Fair Value Option is available when an entity first recognizes a financial asset or liability or upon entering into a firm commitment. Additionally,&#13;
 SFAS No. 159 allows for a one-time election for existing positions upon adoption. SFAS No. 157 and SFAS No.159 are to be applied&#13;
 prospectively. The cumulative effect of remeasuring items for which the Fair Value Option has been elected effective July 1, 2007 has been&#13;
 reported as an adjustment to the July 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings.&#13;
&#13;
 The Fair Value Option&#13;
&#13;
 Effective July 1, 2007, IFC elected the Fair Value Option for the following financial assets and financial liabilities existing at the time of adoption&#13;
 and entered into during the year ended June 30, 2008 and the year ended June 30, 2009:&#13;
 (i) direct equity investments in which IFC has significant influence and other financial interests (e.g. loans) to such investees;&#13;
 (ii) direct equity investments representing 20 percent or more ownership but in which IFC does not have significant influence and certain&#13;
       investments in Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs) and Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs) that maintain specific ownership accounts and&#13;
       loans or guarantees to such investees; and&#13;
 (iii) all market borrowings, except for such borrowings having no associated derivative instruments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
All borrowings for which the Fair Value Option has been elected are associated with existing derivative instruments used to create a fair value-&#13;
like or cash flow-like hedge relationship, a substantial amount of which were previously designated as accounting hedges in accordance with&#13;
SFAS No. 133. Measuring at fair value those borrowings for which the Fair Value Option has been elected at fair value mitigates the earnings&#13;
volatility caused by measuring the borrowings and related derivative differently (in the absence of a designated accounting hedge) without&#13;
having to apply SFAS No. 133's complex hedge accounting requirements. The Fair Value Option was not elected for all borrowings from IBRD&#13;
and all other market borrowings because such borrowings fund assets with similar characteristics.&#13;
&#13;
Measuring at fair value those equity investments that would otherwise require equity method accounting simplifies the accounting and renders a&#13;
carrying amount on the consolidated balance sheet based on a measure (fair value) that IFC considers superior to equity method accounting.&#13;
For the investments that otherwise would require equity method accounting for which the Fair Value Option is elected, SFAS No. 159 requires&#13;
the Fair Value Option to also be applied to all eligible financial interests in the same entity. IFC has disbursed loans to certain of such&#13;
investees, therefore, the Fair Value Option was also applied to those loans effective July 1, 2007. IFC elected the Fair Value Option for equity&#13;
investments with 20% or more ownership where it does not have significant influence so that the same measurement method (fair value) will be&#13;
applied to all equity investments with more than 20% ownership.&#13;
&#13;
Fair Value Measurements&#13;
&#13;
SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability (i.e., an exit price) in an orderly&#13;
transaction between independent, knowledgeable and willing market participants at the measurement date assuming the transaction occurs in&#13;
the entity's principal (or most advantageous) market. Fair value must be based on assumptions market participants would use (inputs) in&#13;
determining the price and measured assuming the highest and best use for the asset by market participants. The highest and best use of the&#13;
IFC assets and liabilities measured at fair value is considered to be in exchange, therefore, their fair values are determined based on a&#13;
transaction to sell or transfer the asset or liability on a standalone basis. Under SFAS No. 157, fair value measurements are not adjusted for&#13;
transaction costs.&#13;
&#13;
Pursuant to the adoption of SFAS No. 157, IFC now reports equity investments that are listed in markets that provide readily determinable fair&#13;
values at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses being reported in other comprehensive income.&#13;
&#13;
The fair value hierarchy established by SFAS No, 157 gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical&#13;
unrestricted assets and liabilities (Level 1), the next highest priority to observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are&#13;
corroborated by market data from independent sources (Level 2) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by&#13;
market data (Level 3). Fair value measurements are required to maximize the use of available observable inputs.&#13;
&#13;
Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments whose values are based on unadjusted quoted market prices. It includes IFC's equity&#13;
investments which are listed in markets that provide readily determinable fair values, government issues, money market funds and borrowings&#13;
that are listed on exchanges.&#13;
&#13;
Level 2 includes financial instruments that are valued using models and other valuation methodologies. These models consider various&#13;
assumptions and inputs, including time value, yield curves, volatility factors, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severity and current market&#13;
and contractual pricing for the underlying asset, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these inputs are observable in&#13;
the market place, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which market transactions are executed.&#13;
Financial instruments categorized as Level 2 include non-exchange-traded derivatives such as interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps,&#13;
certain asset-backed securities, as well as the portion of IFC's borrowings not included in Level 1.&#13;
&#13;
Level 3 consists of financial instruments whose fair value is estimated based on internally developed models or methodologies utilizing&#13;
significant inputs that are non-observable. It also includes financial instruments whose fair value is estimated based on price information from&#13;
independent sources that cannot be corroborated by observable market data. Included in Level 3 are the majority of equity investments for&#13;
which IFC has elected the Fair Value Option.&#13;
&#13;
Translation of currencies ­ Assets and liabilities not denominated in US dollars, other than disbursed equity investments, are expressed in US&#13;
dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008. Disbursed equity investments, other than those accounted for at fair&#13;
value, are expressed in US dollars at the prevailing exchange rates at the time of disbursement. Income and expenses are recorded based on the&#13;
rates of exchange prevailing at the time of the transaction. Transaction gains and losses are credited or charged to income.&#13;
&#13;
Loans ­ IFC originates loans to facilitate project finance, restructuring, refinancing, corporate finance, and/or other developmental objectives.&#13;
Loans are recorded as assets when disbursed. Loans are generally carried at the principal amounts outstanding adjusted for net unamortized&#13;
loan origination costs and fees. It is IFC's practice to obtain collateral security such as, but not limited to, mortgages and third-party guarantees.&#13;
&#13;
Effective July 1, 2007, certain loans are carried at fair value in accordance with the Fair Value Option as discussed above. Unrealized gains and&#13;
losses on loans accounted for at fair value under the Fair Value Option are reported in income from loans and guarantees on the consolidated&#13;
income statement.&#13;
&#13;
IFC enters into loans with income participation, prepayment and conversion features; these features are bifurcated and separately accounted for&#13;
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,&#13;
as amended, if they meet the definition of a derivative, are not considered to be clearly and closely related to their host loan contracts and their&#13;
host loan contracts are not accounted for at fair value through net income. Otherwise, these features are accounted for as part of their host loan&#13;
contracts in accordance with IFC's accounting policies for loans as indicated herein.&#13;

               NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Revenue recognition on loans ­ Interest income and commitment fees on loans are recorded as income on an accrual basis. Net loan&#13;
 origination costs and fees are amortized over the estimated life of the originated loan to which the fees relate; such amortization is determined&#13;
 using the interest method unless the loan is a revolving credit facility in which case amortization is determined using the straight-line method.&#13;
 Prepayment fees are recorded as income when received in freely convertible currencies.&#13;
&#13;
 IFC does not recognize income on loans where collectability is in doubt or payments of interest or principal are past due more than 60 days&#13;
 unless management anticipates that collection of interest will occur in the near future. Any interest accrued on a loan placed in nonaccrual status&#13;
 is reversed out of income and is thereafter recognized as income only when the actual payment is received. Interest not previously recognized&#13;
 but capitalized as part of a debt restructuring is recorded as deferred income, included in the consolidated balance sheet in payables and other&#13;
 liabilities, and credited to income only when the related principal is received. Such capitalized interest is considered in the computation of the&#13;
 reserve against losses on loans in the consolidated balance sheet.&#13;
&#13;
 Reserve against losses on loans ­ IFC recognizes impairment on loans not carried at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet through the&#13;
 reserve against losses on loans, recording a provision or release of provision for losses on loans in net income, which increases or decreases the&#13;
 reserve against losses on loans. Individually impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows to be&#13;
 received, observable market prices, or for loans that are dependent on collateral for repayment, the estimated fair value of the collateral.&#13;
&#13;
 Management determines the aggregate level of the reserve against losses on loans, taking into account established guidelines and its&#13;
 assessment of recent portfolio quality trends. The guidelines include internal country and loan risk ratings, and the impairment potential of the&#13;
 loan portfolio based on IFC's historical portfolio loss experience on mature loans.&#13;
&#13;
 The reserve against losses on loans reflects estimates of both identified probable losses on individual loans (specific reserves) and probable&#13;
 losses inherent in the portfolio but not specifically identifiable (portfolio reserves). The determination of identified probable losses represents&#13;
 management's judgment of the creditworthiness of the borrower. Reserves against losses are established through a review of individual loans&#13;
 undertaken on a quarterly basis. IFC considers a loan as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that IFC will be&#13;
 unable to collect all amounts due according to the loan's contractual terms. Unidentified probable losses are the losses incurred at the reporting&#13;
 date that have not yet been specifically identified. The risks inherent in the portfolio that are considered in determining unidentified probable&#13;
 losses are those proven to exist by past experience and include: country systemic risk; the risk of correlation or contagion of losses between&#13;
 markets; uninsured and uninsurable risks; nonperformance under guarantees and support agreements; and opacity of, or misrepresentation in,&#13;
 financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
 Loans are written-off when IFC has exhausted all possible means of recovery, by reducing the reserve against losses on loans. Such reductions&#13;
 in the reserve are partially offset by recoveries associated with previously written-off loans.&#13;
&#13;
 Equity investments ­ IFC invests primarily for developmental impact; IFC does not seek to take operational, controlling, or strategic equity&#13;
 positions within its investees. Equity investments are acquired through direct ownership of equity instruments of investees, as a limited partner in&#13;
 LLPs and LLCs, and/or as an investor in private equity funds.&#13;
&#13;
 Revenue recognition on equity investments ­ Effective July 1, 2007, equity investments which are listed in markets that provide readily&#13;
 determinable fair values are accounted for as available-for-sale securities at fair value with unrealized gains and losses being reported in other&#13;
 comprehensive income in accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. As noted above&#13;
 under "Fair Value Option and Fair Value Measurements", also effective July 1, 2007, direct equity investments in which IFC has significant&#13;
 influence, direct equity investments representing 20 percent or more ownership but in which IFC does not have significant influence and certain&#13;
 investments in LLPs and LLCs that maintain specific ownership accounts are accounted for at fair value under the Fair Value Option. Direct&#13;
 equity investments in which IFC does not have significant influence (and prior to July 1, 2007 certain investments representing more than 20%&#13;
 ownership) and which are not listed in markets that provide readily determinable fair values are carried at cost less impairment.&#13;
&#13;
 Prior to July 1, 2007, IFC's investments in companies where it had significant influence and certain investments in LLPs and LLCs that maintain&#13;
 specific ownership accounts were accounted for under the equity method.&#13;
&#13;
 IFC's investments in certain private equity funds in which IFC is deemed to be the Primary Beneficiary of a VIE, as the presumption of control by&#13;
 the fund manager or the general partner has been overcome, are fully consolidated into IFC's books. Certain equity investments, for which&#13;
 recovery of invested capital is uncertain, are accounted for under the cost recovery method, such that receipts of freely convertible currencies are&#13;
 first applied to recovery of invested capital and then to income from equity investments. The cost recovery method is principally applied to IFC's&#13;
 investments in its oil and gas unincorporated joint ventures (UJVs). IFC's share of conditional asset retirement obligations related to&#13;
 investments in UJVs are recorded when the fair value of the obligations can be reasonably estimated. The obligations are capitalized and&#13;
 systematically amortized over the estimated economic useful lives.&#13;
&#13;
 Unrealized gains and losses on equity investments accounted for at fair value under the Fair Value Option are reported in income from equity&#13;
 investments on the consolidated income statement. Unrealized gains and losses on equity investments listed in markets that provide readily&#13;
 determinable fair values which are accounted for as available-for-sale are reported in other comprehensive income.&#13;
&#13;
 Dividends and profit participations received on equity investments are generally recorded as income when received in freely convertible&#13;
 currencies. Realized gains on the sale or redemption of equity investments are measured against the average cost of the investments sold and&#13;
 are generally recorded as income in income from equity investments when received in freely convertible currencies. Capital losses are recognized&#13;
 when incurred.&#13;
&#13;
 IFC enters into put and call option and warrant agreements in connection with equity investments; these are accounted for in accordance with&#13;
 SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities as amended to the extent they meet the definition of a derivative.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Impairment of equity investments ­ Equity investments accounted for at cost less impairment and available-for-sale are assessed for&#13;
impairment each quarter. When impairment is identified, it is generally deemed to be other than temporary, and the equity investment is written&#13;
down to the impaired value, which becomes the new cost basis in the equity investment. Such other than temporary impairments are recognized&#13;
in net income. Subsequent increases in the fair value of available-for-sale equity investments are included in other comprehensive income -&#13;
subsequent decreases in fair value, if not other than temporary impairment, also are included in other comprehensive income.&#13;
&#13;
Debt securities ­ Debt securities in the investment portfolio are classified as available-for-sale and carried at fair value on the consolidated&#13;
balance sheet with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income until realized. Realized gains on sales of&#13;
debt securities and interest on debt securities is included in income from debt securities on the consolidated income statement.&#13;
&#13;
IFC invests in certain debt securities with conversion features; these features are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting&#13;
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities as amended to the extent they meet the definition of a derivative.&#13;
&#13;
Impairment of debt securities ­ Debt securities in the investment portfolio are assessed for impairment each quarter. Beginning April 1, 2009,&#13;
when impairment is identified, the entire impairment is recognized in net income if (1) IFC intends to sell the security, (2) it is more likely than not&#13;
that IFC will be required to sell the security before recovery, or (3) IFC does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security.&#13;
However, if IFC does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that IFC will be required to sell the security but the security&#13;
has suffered a credit loss, the impairment charge will be separated into the credit loss component, which is recognized in net income, and the&#13;
remainder which is recorded in other comprehensive income. The impaired value becomes the new amortized cost basis of the debt security.&#13;
Subsequent increases and decreases - if not an additional other-than-temporary impairment - in the fair value of debt securities are included in&#13;
other comprehensive income.&#13;
&#13;
The difference between the new amortized cost basis of debt securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment has been recognized in net&#13;
income and the cash flows expected to be collected is accreted to interest income using the effective yield method. Significant subsequent&#13;
increases in the expected or actual cash flows previously expected are recognized as a prospective adjustment of the yield.&#13;
&#13;
Prior to April 1, 2009, an identified impairment was generally deemed to be other-than-temporary unless IFC was able to demonstrate it had the&#13;
ability and intent to hold the debt security for the period for which recovery was anticipated. Debt securities that were impaired and for which the&#13;
impairment was deemed to be other than temporary were written down to the impaired value, which became the new cost basis in the debt&#13;
security. Other-than-temporary impairments were recognized in net income.&#13;
&#13;
Guarantees ­ IFC extends financial guarantee facilities to its clients to provide credit enhancement for their debt securities and trade obligations.&#13;
IFC offers partial credit guarantees to clients covering, on a risk-sharing basis, client obligations on bonds and/or loans. Under the terms of IFC's&#13;
guarantees, IFC agrees to assume responsibility for the client's financial obligations in the event of default by the client (i.e., failure to pay when&#13;
payment is due). Guarantees are regarded as issued when IFC commits to the guarantee. Guarantees are regarded as outstanding when the&#13;
underlying financial obligation of the client is incurred, and this date is considered to be the "inception" of the guarantee. Guarantees are&#13;
regarded as called when IFC's obligation under the guarantee has been invoked. There are two liabilities associated with the guarantees: (1) the&#13;
stand-ready obligation to perform and (2) the contingent liability. The fair value of the stand-ready obligation to perform is recognized at the&#13;
inception of the guarantee unless a contingent liability exists at that time or is expected to exist in the near term. The contingent liability&#13;
associated with the financial guarantee is recognized when it is probable the guarantee will be called and when the amount of guarantee called&#13;
can be reasonably estimated. All liabilities associated with guarantees are included in payables and other liabilities, and the receivables are&#13;
included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. When the guarantees are called, the amount disbursed is recorded as a new loan,&#13;
and specific reserves against losses are established, based on the estimated probable loss. Guarantee fees are recorded in income as the&#13;
stand-ready obligation to perform is fulfilled. Commitment fees on guarantees are recorded as income on an accrual basis.&#13;
&#13;
Designations of retained earnings ­ IFC establishes funding mechanisms for specific Board approved purposes through designations of&#13;
retained earnings. Designations of retained earnings for grants to IDA are recorded as a transfer from undesignated retained earnings to&#13;
designated retained earnings when the designation is approved by the Board of Governors. All other designations are recorded as a transfer&#13;
from undesignated retained earnings to designated retained earnings when the designation is noted with approval by the Board of Directors.&#13;
Total designations of retained earnings are determined based on IFC's annual income before expenditures against designated retained&#13;
earnings and net gains and losses on other non-trading financial instruments accounted for at fair value in excess of $150 million, and&#13;
contemplating the financial capacity and strategic priorities of IFC.&#13;
&#13;
Expenditures resulting from such designations are recorded as expenses in IFC's consolidated income statement in the year in which they are&#13;
incurred, also having the effect of reducing the respective designated retained earnings for such purposes. Expenditures are deemed to have&#13;
been incurred when IFC has ceded control of the funds to the recipient. If the recipient organization is deemed to be controlled by IFC, the&#13;
expenditure is deemed to have been incurred only when the recipient organization disburses the funds to a non-related party. On occasion,&#13;
recipient organizations which are deemed to be controlled by IFC will acquire certain investment assets other than cash. These investments&#13;
have had no material impact on IFC's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In such cases, IFC includes those assets on its&#13;
consolidated balance sheet, where they remain until the recipient organization disposes of or transfers the asset or IFC is deemed to no longer&#13;
be in control of the recipient organization. Investments resulting from such designations are recorded on IFC's consolidated balance sheet in&#13;
the year in which they occur, also having effect of reducing the respective designated retained earnings for such purposes.&#13;

               NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Liquid asset portfolio ­ IFC's liquid funds are invested in government, agency and government-sponsored agency obligations, time deposits&#13;
 and asset-backed, including mortgage-backed, securities. Government and agency obligations include positions in high quality fixed rate bonds,&#13;
 notes, bills, and other obligations issued or unconditionally guaranteed by governments of countries or other official entities including government&#13;
 agencies and instrumentalities or by multilateral organizations. Asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities include agency and non agency&#13;
 residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities, consumer, auto- and student loans-backed securities,&#13;
 commercial real estate collateralized debt obligations and collateralized loan obligations. The liquid asset portfolio, as defined by IFC, consists&#13;
 of: time deposits and securities; related derivative instruments; securities purchased under resale agreements, securities sold under repurchase&#13;
 agreements and payable for cash collateral received; receivables from sales of securities and payables for purchases of securities; and related&#13;
 accrued income and charges.&#13;
&#13;
 Securities and related derivative instruments within IFC's liquid asset portfolio are classified as trading and are carried at fair value with any&#13;
 changes in fair value reported in income from liquid asset trading activities. Interest on securities and amortization of premiums and accretion of&#13;
 discounts are also reported in income from liquid asset trading activities. Gains and losses realized on the sale of trading securities are computed&#13;
 on a specific security basis.&#13;
&#13;
 IFC classifies cash and due from banks and time deposits (collectively, cash and cash equivalents) as cash and cash equivalents in the&#13;
 consolidated statement of cash flows because they are generally readily convertible to known amounts of cash within 90 days of acquisition.&#13;
&#13;
 Repurchase and resale agreements ­ Repurchase agreements are contracts under which a party sells securities and simultaneously agrees to&#13;
 repurchase the same securities at a specified future date at a fixed price. Resale agreements are contracts under which a party purchases&#13;
 securities and simultaneously agrees to resell the same securities at a specified future date at a fixed price.&#13;
&#13;
 It is IFC's policy to take possession of securities purchased under resale agreements, which are primarily liquid government securities. The&#13;
 market value of these securities is monitored and, within parameters defined in the agreements, additional collateral is obtained when their value&#13;
 declines. IFC also monitors its exposure with respect to securities sold under repurchase agreements and, in accordance with the terms of the&#13;
 agreements, requests the return of excess securities held by the counterparty when their value increases.&#13;
&#13;
 Repurchase and resale agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and recorded at the amount at which the securities&#13;
 were acquired or sold plus accrued interest.&#13;
&#13;
 Borrowings ­ To diversify its access to funding, and reduce its borrowing costs, IFC borrows in a variety of currencies and uses a number of&#13;
 borrowing structures, including foreign exchange rate-linked, inverse floating rate and zero coupon notes. Generally, IFC simultaneously converts&#13;
 such borrowings into variable rate US dollar borrowings through the use of currency and interest rate swap transactions. Under certain&#13;
 outstanding borrowing agreements, IFC is not permitted to mortgage or allow a lien to be placed on its assets (other than purchase money&#13;
 security interests) without extending equivalent security to the holders of such borrowings.&#13;
&#13;
 Effective July 1, 2007, substantially all borrowings are carried at fair value under the Fair Value Option with changes in fair value reported in net&#13;
 gains and losses on other non-trading financial instruments accounted for at fair value in the consolidated income statement.&#13;
&#13;
 Prior to July 1, 2007, where borrowings were part of a designated hedging relationship employing derivative instruments, the carrying amount was&#13;
 adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged. Adjustments for changes in fair value attributable to hedged risks were&#13;
 reported in net gains and losses on other non-trading financial instruments accounted for at fair value in the consolidated income statement. All&#13;
 other borrowings were recorded at the amount repayable at maturity, adjusted for unamortized premiums and unaccreted discounts.&#13;
&#13;
 Interest on borrowings, amortization of premiums accretion of discounts are reported in charges on borrowings.&#13;
&#13;
 Interest on borrowings and amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are reported in charges on borrowings.&#13;
&#13;
 Risk management and use of derivative instruments ­ IFC enters into transactions in various derivative instruments for financial risk&#13;
 management purposes in connection with its principal business activities, including lending, investing in debt securities and equity investments,&#13;
 client risk management, borrowing, liquid asset portfolio management and asset and liability management.&#13;
&#13;
 All derivative instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value as derivative assets or derivative liabilities. Where they&#13;
 are not clearly and closely related to the host contract, certain derivative instruments embedded in loans, debt securities and equity investments&#13;
 are bifurcated from the host contract and recorded at fair value as derivative assets and liabilities. The fair value at inception of such embedded&#13;
 derivatives is excluded from the carrying value of the host contracts on the consolidated balance sheet. Changes in fair values of derivative&#13;
 instruments used in the liquid asset portfolio are recorded in income from liquid asset trading activities. Changes in fair values of derivative&#13;
 instruments other than those in the liquid asset portfolio are recorded in net gains and losses on other non-trading financial instruments accounted&#13;
 for at fair value.&#13;
&#13;
 Prior to July 1, 2007, IFC designated certain hedging relationships in its borrowing activities as fair value hedges. For a derivative instrument&#13;
 qualifying as a fair value hedge, fair value gains or losses on the derivative instrument were reported in net gains and losses on other non-trading&#13;
 financial instruments accounted for at fair value, together with offsetting fair value gains or losses on the hedged item that were attributable to the&#13;
 risk being hedged. IFC generally matches the terms of its derivatives with the terms of the specific underlying borrowing hedged, in terms of&#13;
 currencies, maturity dates, reset dates, interest rates, and other features. However, the valuation methodologies applied to the derivative and the&#13;
 hedged financial instrument differed. The resulting ineffectiveness calculated for such relationships was recorded in net gains and losses on other&#13;
 non-trading financial instruments accounted for at fair value in the consolidated income statement. Fair value gains and losses on derivative&#13;
 instruments not in the liquid asset portfolio and not qualifying as a hedge were reported in the net gains and losses on other non-trading financial&#13;
 instruments accounted for at fair value.&#13;

               NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IFC has not designated any hedging relationships as cash flow hedges and subsequent to June 30, 2007, IFC has not designated any hedging&#13;
relationships as fair value hedges.&#13;
&#13;
The risk management policy for each of IFC's principal business activities and the accounting policies particular to them are described below.&#13;
&#13;
Lending activities IFC's policy is to closely match the currency, interest rate basis, and maturity of its loans and borrowings. Derivative&#13;
instruments are used to convert the cash flows from fixed rate US dollar or non-US dollar loans into variable rate US dollars. IFC has elected not&#13;
to designate any hedging relationships for all lending-related derivatives.&#13;
&#13;
Client risk management activities IFC enters into derivatives transactions with its clients to help them hedge their own currency, interest rate, or&#13;
commodity risk, which, in turn, improves the overall quality of IFC's loan portfolio. To hedge the market risks that arise from these transactions&#13;
with clients, IFC enters into offsetting derivative transactions with matching terms with authorized market counterparties. Changes in fair value of&#13;
all derivatives associated with these activities are reported in net income in net gains and losses on other non-trading financial instruments&#13;
accounted for at fair value. Fees and spreads charged on these transactions are recorded in other income in the consolidated income statement&#13;
on an accrual basis.&#13;
&#13;
Borrowing activities IFC issues debt securities in various capital markets with the objectives of minimizing its borrowing costs, diversifying funding&#13;
sources, and developing member countries' capital markets, sometimes using complex structures. These structures include borrowings payable&#13;
in multiple currencies, or borrowings with principal and/or interest determined by reference to a specified index such as a stock market index, a&#13;
reference interest rate, a commodity index, or one or more foreign exchange rates. IFC uses derivative instruments with matching terms,&#13;
primarily currency and interest rate swaps, to convert such borrowings into variable rate US dollar obligations, consistent with IFC's matched&#13;
funding policy. Prior to July 1, 2007 IFC designated the majority of derivatives associated with borrowing activities as fair value hedges of the&#13;
underlying borrowings. There were a small number of fair value-like and cash flow-like hedging transactions for which no hedge relationships&#13;
were designated. Effective July 1, 2007, IFC elected to carry at fair value, under the Fair Value Option, all market borrowings for which a&#13;
derivative instrument is used to create a fair value-like or cash flow-like hedge relationship. Changes in the fair value of such borrowings and the&#13;
associated derivatives are reported in net gains and losses on other non-trading financial instruments accounted for at fair value in the&#13;
consolidated income statement. Subsequent to June 30, 2007, these items are no longer designated as hedges.&#13;
&#13;
Liquid asset portfolio management activities IFC manages the interest rate, currency and other market risks associated with certain of the time&#13;
deposits and securities in its liquid asset portfolio by entering into derivative transactions to convert the cash flows from those instruments into&#13;
variable rate US dollars, consistent with IFC's matched funding policy. The derivative instruments used include short-term, over-the-counter&#13;
foreign exchange forwards (covered forwards), interest rate and currency swaps, and exchange-traded interest rate futures and options. As the&#13;
entire liquid asset portfolio is classified as a trading portfolio, all securities (including derivatives) are carried at fair value with changes in fair value&#13;
reported in income from liquid asset trading activities. No derivatives in the liquid asset portfolio have been designated as hedges.&#13;
&#13;
Asset and liability management In addition to the risk managed in the context of its business activities detailed above, IFC faces residual market&#13;
risk in its overall asset and liability management. Residual currency risk is managed by monitoring the aggregate position in each lending&#13;
currency and reducing the net excess asset or liability position through sales or purchases. Interest rate risk arising from mismatches due to&#13;
writedowns, prepayments and reschedulings, and residual reset date mismatches is monitored by measuring the sensitivity of the present value&#13;
of assets and liabilities in each currency to each basis point change in interest rates.&#13;
&#13;
IFC monitors the credit risk associated with these activities by careful assessment and monitoring of prospective and actual clients and&#13;
counterparties. In respect of liquid assets and derivatives transactions, credit risk is managed by establishing exposure limits based on the credit&#13;
rating and size of the individual counterparty. In addition, IFC has entered into master agreements governing derivative transactions that contain&#13;
close-out and netting provisions and collateral arrangements. Under these agreements, if IFC's credit exposure to a counterparty, on a mark-to-&#13;
market basis, exceeds a specified level, the counterparty must post collateral to cover the excess, generally in the form of liquid government&#13;
securities or cash. IFC does not offset the fair value amounts of derivatives and obligations to return cash collateral associated with these master&#13;
netting agreements. As of June 30, 2009, IFC had no outstanding obligations to return cash collateral under master netting agreements.&#13;
&#13;
Loan participations ­ IFC mobilizes funds from commercial banks and other financial institutions (Participants) by facilitating loan participations,&#13;
without recourse. These loan participations are administered and serviced by IFC on behalf of the Participants. The disbursed and outstanding&#13;
balances of loan participations that meet the applicable accounting criteria are accounted for as sales and are not included in IFC's consolidated&#13;
balance sheet. All other loan participations are accounted for as secured borrowings and are included in loans on IFC's consolidated balance&#13;
sheet, with the related secured borrowings included in payables and other liabilities on IFC's consolidated balance sheet.&#13;
&#13;
Pension and other postretirement benefits ­ IBRD has a defined benefit Staff Retirement Plan (SRP), a Retired Staff Benefits Plan (RSBP)&#13;
and a Post-Employment Benefits Plan (PEBP) that cover substantially all of its staff members as well as the staff of IFC and of MIGA.&#13;
&#13;
The SRP provides regular pension benefits and includes a cash balance plan. The RSBP provides certain health and life insurance benefits to&#13;
eligible retirees. The PEBP provides pension benefits administered outside the SRP. All costs associated with these plans are allocated between&#13;
IBRD, IFC, and MIGA based upon their employees' respective participation in the plans. In addition, IFC and MIGA reimburse IBRD for their&#13;
share of any contributions made to these plans by IBRD.&#13;
&#13;
The net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit income or expense allocated to IFC is included in income or expense from pension and&#13;
other postretirement benefit plans in the consolidated income statement. IFC includes a receivable from IBRD in receivables and other assets,&#13;
representing prepaid pension and other postretirement benefit costs.&#13;

               NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Variable Interest Entities ­ In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities - an&#13;
 interpretation of ARB No. 51 (FIN 46). During December 2003, FASB replaced FIN 46 with FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of&#13;
 Variable Interest Entities - an interpretation of ARB No. 51 (FIN 46R). FIN 46 and FIN 46R define certain VIEs and require parties to such&#13;
 entities to assess and measure variable interests in the VIEs for the purposes of determining possible consolidation of the VIEs. Variable&#13;
 interests can arise from financial instruments, service contracts, guarantees, leases or other arrangements with a VIE. An entity that will absorb&#13;
 a majority of a VIE's expected losses or expected residual returns is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE and must include the&#13;
 assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the VIE in its consolidated financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
 IFC has a number of investments in VIEs which it manages and supervises in a manner consistent with other portfolio investments. Note W&#13;
 provides further details regarding IFC's variable interests in VIEs.&#13;
&#13;
 Recently adopted accounting standards ­ In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and&#13;
 Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 161). SFAS No. 161 requires enhanced disclosures about derivatives and hedging activities to enable a better&#13;
 understanding of their effects on the reporting entity's financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. It is effective for the first set of&#13;
 financial statements for a reporting period, annual or interim, that begins after November 15, 2008, which was the three months ended March 31,&#13;
 2009 for IFC.&#13;
&#13;
 In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (SFAS No. 162). SFAS No. 162&#13;
 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements&#13;
 of nongovernmental entities that are presented in accordance with US GAAP. SFAS No. 162 was effective November 15, 2008. Adoption of&#13;
 SFAS No. 162 did not have a material impact on IFC's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.&#13;
&#13;
 On October 10, 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 157-3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When a&#13;
 Market for That Asset Is Not Active (FSP FAS 157-3). FAP FAS 157-3 was effective upon its release and clarifies the application of SFAS No.&#13;
 157 in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when&#13;
 the market for that asset is not active. FSP FAS 157-3 did not have a material impact on IFC's financial position, results of operations or cash&#13;
 flows.&#13;
&#13;
 On September 12, 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 133-1 and FIN 45-4, Disclosures about Credit Derivatives and Certain Guarantees: An&#13;
 Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 and FASB Interpretation No. 45; and Clarification of the Effective date of FASB Statement No. 161 (FSP&#13;
 FAS 133-1 and FIN 45-4). FSP FAS 133-1 and FIN 45-4 amends SFAS No. 133 to require a seller of credit derivatives, including credit&#13;
 derivatives embedded in hybrid instruments, to provide disclosures for each credit derivative (or group of similar credit derivatives) for each&#13;
 statement of financial position presented and clarifies the effective date for SFAS No. 161 (see third preceding paragraph above for effective date&#13;
 of SFAS No. 161). FSP FAS 133-1 and FIN 45-4 was effective for annual or interim reporting periods ending after November 15, 2008 (which&#13;
 was the three months ended December 31, 2008 for IFC).&#13;
&#13;
 On December 11, 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8, Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) about Transfers of&#13;
 Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities (FSP FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8). FSP 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8 requires additional&#13;
 disclosures about transfers of financial assets and an enterprise's involvement with VIEs, including Qualifying Special Purpose Entities (QSPEs).&#13;
  Transferors of financial assets must disclose (1) the terms of any arrangements that could require them to provide financial or other support to a&#13;
 transferee (including VIEs and nontransferor QSPEs for which the transferor is the primary beneficiary, sponsor or servicer or in which the&#13;
 transferor has a significant variable interest) and (2) the type and amount of financial or other support provided during the period to those&#13;
 transferees that was not contractually required and the reasons for providing it. FSP FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8 also requires disclosure of (1)&#13;
 the details of any Special Purpose Entities (SPEs) involved in a transfer, including the nature, purpose, size, and activities of the SPE, and how it&#13;
 was financed, (2) with respect to VIEs (a) the method of determining whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, including&#13;
 significant judgments and assumptions made, and (b) whether the consolidation conclusion has changed in the most recent financial statements,&#13;
 (3) with respect to QSPEs for which the enterprise is the sponsor or the servicer (a) details about the QSPE including the nature, purpose, size,&#13;
 and activities of the QSPE, and how it is financed, and (b) the enterprise's maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the&#13;
 QSPE, and (4) how servicing assets and liabilities are reported under FAS 140. FSP FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8 were effective for the first&#13;
 interim or fiscal reporting period ending after December 15, 2008 (which was the three months ended December 31, 2008 for IFC).&#13;
&#13;
 On January 12, 2009, the FASB issued FSP EITF 99-20-1, Amendments to Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue No. 99-20 (FSP EITF 99-20-1).&#13;
 FSP EITF 99-20-1 amends the impairment model in EITF 99-20 for certain investments in securitized financial assets to remove its exclusive&#13;
 reliance on "market participant" estimates of future cash flows used in determining fair value, thus allowing the reporting entity to apply reasonable&#13;
 judgment in assessing whether an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred with respect to those investments. FSP EITF 99-20-1 was&#13;
 effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2008 (which was the three months ended December 31, 2008 for&#13;
 IFC) and did not have a material impact on IFC's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.&#13;
&#13;
 In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 165, Subsequent Events. SFAS No. 165 establishes general standards of accounting for and&#13;
 disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued. It sets forth the period after the balance&#13;
 sheet date during which events or transactions must be evaluated for recognition or disclosure, the circumstances under which events or&#13;
 transactions occurring after balance date should be recognized in the financial statements, and the related disclosures that should be made.&#13;
 SFAS No. 165 was effective for interim and annual financial statements ending after June 15, 2009 (which was the year ended June 30, 2009 for&#13;
 IFC. The adoption of SFAS No. 165 had no material impact on IFC's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.&#13;

              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
On April 9, 2009, the FASB issued FSP 157-4, Determining Fair Value When the Level of Activity for an Asset or Liability Have Significantly&#13;
Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly (FSP FAS 157-4). FSP FAS 157-4 provides additional guidance for estimating fair&#13;
value in inactive markets and for distressed transactions. Under FSP FAS157-4, reporting entities are required to determine whether there has&#13;
been a significant decrease in market activity for an asset or liability, in which case further analysis of transactions and quoted prices is needed&#13;
to determine if significant adjustment is necessary to arrive at an estimate of fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 157. Reporting entities are&#13;
also required to evaluate whether a transaction was orderly based on the weight of the evidence. If the transaction was orderly or the reporting&#13;
entity does not have sufficient information to conclude whether the transaction was orderly, the reporting entity must consider that transaction&#13;
price when estimating fair value - the amount of weight placed on that transaction price will depend on the facts and circumstance with less&#13;
weight being placed on transactions where there is not sufficient information to conclude whether the transaction was orderly. If the transaction&#13;
was not orderly, the reporting entity must place little, if any weight, on that transaction price. Regardless of the valuation techniques used,&#13;
companies must include appropriate risk adjustments that reflect an orderly transaction between market participants under current market&#13;
conditions. FSP FSP 157-4 also requires additional disclosures of the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value and a&#13;
discussion of any changes in those techniques. FSP FAS 157-4 was effective for the first interim or annual reporting period ending after June&#13;
15, 2009 (which is the three months ended June 30, 2009 for IFC) and must be prospectively applied. The adoption of FSP FAS 157-4 had no&#13;
material impact on IFC's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.&#13;
&#13;
On April 9, 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, Recognition and Presentation of Other-Than-Temporary Impairments, (FSP&#13;
FAS 115-2 and 124-2). FSP 115-2 and 124-2 modify the indicator of other-than-temporary-impairment (OTTI) for debt securities and&#13;
incorporates factors currently included in other authoritative literature into the model for determining whether a debt security is other-than-&#13;
temporarily-impaired. Among other things, FSP FAS115-2 and 124-2 change the amount of OTTI recognized in net income when there is a&#13;
credit loss component to an impairment of a debt security which the reporting entity does not intend to sell and is not more likely than not to be&#13;
required to sell prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis. In those situations the OTTI representing credit losses must be recognized in net&#13;
income - the noncredit-related portion must be recognized in other comprehensive income. In addition, FSP FAS 115-2 and 124-2 requires&#13;
disclosures regarding the types of debt and equity securities held, unrealized loss positions for which OTTI has not been recognized, the&#13;
reasons that a portion of an OTTI was not recognized in net income and the methodology and significant inputs used to determine the portion of&#13;
OTTI recognized in net income. FSP FAS 115-2 and 124-2 was effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009&#13;
(which is the three months ended June 30, 2009 for IFC) and must be applied to existing and new investments held as of the beginning of the&#13;
interim period of adoption. IFC adopted FSP FAS 115-2 and 124-2 effective April 1, 2009. The adoption of FSP FAS 115-2 and 124-2 resulted&#13;
in the reclassification of non-credit-related OTTI on debt securities to other comprehensive income of $34 million in the year ended June 30,&#13;
2009.&#13;
&#13;
Accounting and financial reporting developments ­ In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (Revised 2007), Business&#13;
Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)). SFAS No. 141(R) replaces SFAS No. 141, Business Combination, but retains its fundamental requirement&#13;
that the acquisition method of accounting (formerly referred to as the purchase method) be used for all business combinations and for the&#13;
acquirer to be identified for each business combination. Among other things, SFAS No. 141(R) requires the acquirer to recognize the assets&#13;
acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date measured at their fair values, with limited&#13;
exceptions. SFAS No. 141(R) requires acquisition related costs to be recognized separately from the acquisition. Acquirers in a step&#13;
acquisition must recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities, as well as the full amount of the non-controlling interests in the acquiree, at the&#13;
full amounts of their fair value under SFAS No. 141(R). SFAS No. 141(R) is effective prospectively to business combinations/acquisitions on or&#13;
after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008 (which is the year ending June 30, 2010 for&#13;
IFC) and is not expected to have a material impact on IFC's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.&#13;
&#13;
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - an amendment of ARB&#13;
No. 151 (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 clarifies that non-controlling interests in a consolidated entity should be reported as equity in the&#13;
consolidated financial statements. It requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts attributable to both the parent and the non-&#13;
controlling interest and disclosure on the consolidated statement of income of the amounts of income attributable to the parent and to the non-&#13;
controlling interest. SFAS No. 160 clarifies that all changes in a parent's ownership interest that do not result in loss of control are equity&#13;
transactions and requires that a parent recognize gain or loss when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years&#13;
beginning on or after December 15, 2008 (which is the year ending June 30, 2010 for IFC) and is not expected to have a material impact on&#13;
IFC's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.&#13;
&#13;
In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 163, Accounting for Financial Guarantee Insurance contracts - an interpretation of FASB Statement No.&#13;
60. (SFAS No. 163) SFAS No. 163 requires insurance enterprises that issue financial guarantee contracts to initially recognize the premium&#13;
received as unearned premium revenue and to recognize that premium revenue over the period in which the protection is provided and in&#13;
proportion to it. It also requires recognition of a claim liability before an event of default if there is evidence that credit deterioration of the&#13;
guaranteed obligation has occurred. SFAS No. 163 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008&#13;
(which is the year ending June 30, 2010 for IFC). SFAS No. 163 is not expected to apply to IFC.&#13;
&#13;
On April 9, 2009 the FASB issued FSP 107-1 and APB 28-1, Interim Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments (FSP FAS 107-1&#13;
and APB 28-1). FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1 requires disclosure about the fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods that&#13;
were previously required only for annual reporting periods. FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1 are effective for interim periods ending after June 15,&#13;
2009 (which is the three months ending September 30, 2009 for IFC).&#13;

&#13;
               NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets - an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 (SFAS&#13;
 No. 166). SFAS No. 166 removes the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity (QSPE) from Statement 140 and removes the exception from&#13;
 applying FIN 46 to QSPEs. It clarifies Statement 140's objective of determining whether a transferor has surrendered control over transferred&#13;
 financial assets, and limits the circumstances in which a financial asset, or portion of a financial asset, should be derecognized when the entire&#13;
 financial asset has not been transferred and/or when the transferor has continuing involvement with the transferred financial asset. SFAS No.&#13;
 166 defines the term participating interest to establish specific conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale. If the&#13;
 transfer does not meet those conditions, a transferor must account for the transfer as a sale only if it transfers an entire financial asset and&#13;
 surrenders control over the entire transferred assets in accordance with the conditions in Statement 140, as amended. SFAS No. 166 requires&#13;
 that a transferor recognize and initially measure at fair value all assets obtained and liabilities incurred as a result of a transfer of a financial asset.&#13;
 SFAS No. 166 also requires enhanced financial statement disclosures about transfers of financial assets and a transferor's continuing&#13;
 involvement in transferred financial assets. SFAS No. 166 is effective as of the beginning of the reporting entity's first annual reporting period that&#13;
 begins after November 15, 2009 (which is the year ended June 30, 2011 for IFC) and for interim periods within that first annual reporting period.&#13;
 IFC is evaluating the provisions of SFAS No. 166.&#13;
&#13;
 In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (SFAS No. 167). SFAS No. 167 amends FIN&#13;
 46(R) to require the analysis of whether the reporting entity's variable interests give it a controlling financial interest in a VIE. If so, the reporting&#13;
 entity is considered to be the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE. SFAS No. 167 defines a controlling interest as an interest having&#13;
 both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of or the&#13;
 right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. SFAS No. 167 requires on-going assessments of whether&#13;
 the reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a VIE and eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary&#13;
 beneficiary of a VIE. SFAS No. 167 also amends FIN 46(R) to require a troubled debt restructuring to be considered an event that requires&#13;
 reconsideration of whether an entity is a VIE and whether a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. SFAS No. 167 requires enhanced&#13;
 disclosures aimed at providing more transparent information about an enterprise's involvement in VIE's and nullifies FASB FSP 140-4 and FIN&#13;
 46(R)-8. However, the content of the enhanced disclosures is generally consistent with that previously required by FSP FAS 140-4 and FIN&#13;
 46(R)-8. SFAS No. 167 is effective as of the beginning of the reporting entity's first annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009&#13;
 (which is the year ended June 30, 2011 for IFC) and for interim periods within that first annual reporting period. IFC is evaluating the provisions of&#13;
 SFAS No. 167.&#13;
&#13;
 In June 2009, The FASB issued SFAS No. 168, The FASB Accounting Standards CodificationTM and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted&#13;
 Accounting principles, a replacement of FASB Statement No. 162 (SFAS No. 168). SFAS No. 168 establishes the FASB Accounting Standards&#13;
 CodificationTM (Codification) as the source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) recognized by the FASB to be&#13;
 applied by nongovernmental entities. On the effective date of SFAS No. 168, the Codification will supersede all then-existing non-SEC&#13;
 accounting and reporting standards. Following SFAS No. 168, the FASB will not issue new standards in the form of SFASs, FINs or EITF&#13;
 abstracts. Instead, it will issue Accounting Standards Updates, which will serve only to update the Codification. SFAS No. 168 is effective for&#13;
 financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009 (which is the three months end September 30, 2009&#13;
 for IFC). SFAS No. 162, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, identified the sources of accounting principles used in&#13;
 preparing financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with GAAP and arranged these sources of GAAP in a&#13;
 hierarchy to be applied accordingly. Once the Codification is in effect, all of its content will carry the same level of authority effectively superseding&#13;
 SFAS No. 162. SFAS No. 168 is not expected to have a material impact on IFC's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.&#13;
&#13;
 In addition, during the year ended June 30, 2009, the FASB issued and/or approved various FASB Staff Positions (FSP), EITF Issues Notes, and&#13;
 other interpretative guidance related to Statements of Financial Accounting Standards and Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinions. IFC&#13;
 analyzed and implemented the new guidance, as appropriate, with no material impact on either the financial position, results of operations or cash&#13;
 flow of IFC.&#13;

 At June 30, 2009 the accumulated reserve for losses on guarantees, included in the consolidated balance sheet in payables and other&#13;

&#13;
 Loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued amounted to $457 million at June 30, 2009 ($369 million - June 30, 2008). Interest&#13;
 income not recognized on nonaccruing loans during the year ended June 30, 2009 totaled $47 million ($78 million - year ended June 30, 2008;&#13;

&#13;
 Guarantees&#13;
&#13;
 Under the terms of IFC's guarantees, IFC agrees to assume responsibility for the client's financial obligations in the event of default by the client,&#13;
 where default is defined as failure to pay when payment is due. Guarantees entered into by IFC generally have maturities consistent with those of&#13;
 the loan portfolio. Guarantees signed at June 30, 2009, totaled $2,055 million ($1,924 million - June 30, 2008). Guarantees of $1,365 million that&#13;
 were outstanding (i.e., not called) at June 30, 2009 ($1,141 million - June 30, 2008), were not included in loans on the IFC's consolidated balance&#13;
 sheet. The outstanding amount represents the maximum amount of undiscounted future payments that IFC could be required to make under&#13;
 these guarantees.&#13;

 NOTE L ­ CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS&#13;
&#13;
 IFC's authorized share capital was increased to $2,450 million through two capital increases in 1992. The subscription and payment period for&#13;
 shares then allocated ended on August 1, 1999, but IFC has agreed to defer the payment date for certain member countries beyond this date.&#13;
 Pursuant to these arrangements, $0 of subscribed shares remained unpaid at June 30, 2009 (less than $1 million - June 30, 2008).&#13;
&#13;
 During the year ended June 30, 2009, 3,104 shares were subscribed and paid by member countries at a par value of $1,000 each (532 - year&#13;
 ended June 30, 2008; 100 - year ended June 30, 2007). During the year ended June 30, 2009, payment was received from outstanding&#13;
 subscriptions in the amount of less than $1 million ($0 - year ended June 30, 2008; $0 - year ended June 30, 2007).&#13;
&#13;
 Under IFC's Articles of Agreement, in the event a member withdraws from IFC, IFC and the member may negotiate on the repurchase of the&#13;
 member's capital stock on such terms as may be appropriate under the circumstances. Such agreement may provide, among other things, for a&#13;
 final settlement of all obligations of the member to IFC. If such an agreement is not made within six months after the member withdraws or such&#13;
 other time as IFC and the member may agree, the repurchase price of the member's capital stock shall be the value thereof shown by the&#13;
 books of IFC on the day when the member withdraws. The repurchase of capital stock is subject to certain conditions including payments in&#13;
 installments, at such times and in such available currency or currencies as IFC reasonably determines, taking into account the financial position&#13;
 of IFC. IFC's Articles of Agreement also provide for the withdrawing member to repay losses on loans and equity investments in excess of&#13;
 reserves provided on the date of withdrawal.&#13;

As discussed in Note A, "Summary of significant accounting and related policies", market borrowings with associated derivatives are accounted&#13;
for at fair value under the Fair Value Option. Differences arise between the movement in the fair value of market borrowings and the fair value&#13;
of the associated derivatives primarily due to the different credit characteristics. The change in fair value reported in "Net unrealized gains on&#13;
market borrowings and associated derivatives" includes the impact of changes in IFC's own credit spread. As credit spreads widen, unrealized&#13;
gains are recorded and when such credit spreads narrow, unrealized losses are recorded (notwithstanding the impact of other factors, such as&#13;

              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
At June 30, 2009, the outstanding volume, measured by US$ equivalent notional, of interest rate contracts was $20,393 million, foreign&#13;
exchange contracts was $267 million and interest rate and currency contracts was $17,769 million. At June 30, 2009, there were 89 equity&#13;
contracts and 3 other derivative contracts related to IFC's loan and equity investment portfolio recognized as derivatives assets or liabilities&#13;
under SFAS No. 133.&#13;
&#13;
IFC enters into interest rate and currency derivatives under standard industry contracts that contain credit risk-linked contingent features with&#13;
respect to collateral requirements. Should IFC's credit rating be downgraded from the current AAA, the credit support annexes of these&#13;
standard swap agreements detail, by swap counterparty, the collateral requirements IFC must satisfy in this event. The aggregate fair value of&#13;
derivatives containing a credit risk-linked contingent feature in a net liability position was $533 million at June 30, 2009. At June 30, 2009 IFC&#13;
had no collateral posted under these agreements. If IFC was downgraded from the current AAA to AA+, then collateral in the amount of $151&#13;
million would be required to be posted against net liability positions by counterparty at June 30, 2009.&#13;
&#13;
Many of IFC's financial instruments are not actively traded in any market. Accordingly, estimates and present value calculations of future cash&#13;
flows are used to estimate the fair values. Determining future cash flows for fair value estimation is subjective and imprecise, and minor changes&#13;
in assumptions or methodologies may materially affect the estimated values. The excess or deficit resulting from the difference between the&#13;
carrying amounts and the fair values presented does not necessarily reflect the realizable values, since IFC generally holds loans, borrowings&#13;
and other financial instruments with contractual maturities with the aim of realizing their historical values.&#13;
&#13;
The estimated fair values reflect the interest rate environments as of June 30, 2009 and June 30, 2008. In different interest rate environments,&#13;
the fair value of IFC's financial assets and liabilities could differ significantly, especially the fair value of certain fixed rate financial instruments.&#13;
Reasonable comparability of fair values among financial institutions is not likely, because of the wide range of permitted valuation techniques and&#13;
numerous estimates that must be made in the absence of secondary market prices. This lack of objective pricing standards introduces a greater&#13;
degree of subjectivity and volatility to these derived or estimated fair values. Therefore, while disclosure of estimated fair values of financial&#13;
instruments is required, readers are cautioned in using these data for purposes of evaluating the financial condition of IFC. The fair values of the&#13;
individual financial instruments do not represent the fair value of IFC taken as a whole.&#13;
&#13;
The methodologies used and key assumptions made to estimate fair values as of June 30, 2009, and June 30, 2008, are summarized below.&#13;
&#13;
Liquid assets - The primary pricing source for the liquid assets is valuations obtained from independent commercial pricing services. The most&#13;
liquid securities in the liquid asset portfolio are exchange traded futures and options and US treasuries. For exchange traded futures and&#13;
options, exchange quoted prices are obtained and these are classified as Level 1 in accordance with SFAS No. 157. Liquid assets valued using&#13;
quoted market prices are also classified as Level 1. US Treasuries are valued using index prices and also classified Level 1. The remaining&#13;
liquid assets valued using vendor prices are classified as Level 2 or Level 3 based on the results of IFC's evaluation of the vendor's pricing&#13;
methodologies. Where vendor prices are not available, liquid assets are valued using model prices; liquid assets valued using model prices are&#13;
classified as Level 2 or Level 3 depending on the degree that model inputs are observable in the market place.&#13;
&#13;
Derivative instruments - Fair values for covered forwards were derived by using quoted market forward exchange rates. Fair values for other&#13;
derivative instruments were derived by determining the present value of estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.&#13;
&#13;
Loans and loan commitments - As of June 30, 2009, IFC enhanced the valuation of the loan portfolio to be consistent with the SFAS No. 157&#13;
framework and its SFAS No.159 loan fair value methodology. Fair values of loans were determined on the basis of discounted cash flows,&#13;
incorporating credit default swap spreads and expected recovery rates. Certain loans contain embedded conversion and/or income participation&#13;
features. If not bifurcated as standalone derivatives, these features were considered in determining the loans' fair value based on the quoted&#13;
market prices or other calculated values of the equity investments into which the loans are convertible and the discounted cash flows of the&#13;
income participation features. Fair values of loan commitments were based on discounted cash flows.&#13;
&#13;
Equity investments - Fair values of equity investments were determined using market prices where available. Equity investments without&#13;
available market prices were valued using valuation techniques appropriate to the investment such as recent transactions, discounted cash flows,&#13;
relative valuation through the use of comparables, net asset values or book values. Where market prices were not available or appropriate&#13;
valuation techniques were not practical, cost was determined to be the best estimate of fair value.&#13;
&#13;
Borrowings - Fair values were derived by using quoted market prices where available. Otherwise, fair values were derived by determining the&#13;
present value of estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount rates.&#13;

NOTE Q ­ CURRENCY POSITION&#13;
&#13;
IFC conducts its operations for loans, debt securities, equity investments, time deposits, trading securities, and borrowings in multiple currencies.&#13;
IFC's policy is to minimize the level of currency risk by closely matching the currency of its assets (other than equity investments and quasi-equity&#13;
investments) and liabilities by using hedging instruments. IFC's equity investments in enterprises located in its developing member countries are&#13;
typically made in the local currency of the country. As a matter of policy, IFC carries the currency risk of equity investments and quasi-equity&#13;
investments and funds these investments from its capital and retained earnings. The following table summarizes IFC's exposure in major&#13;
currencies at June 30, 2009, and June 30, 2008 (US$ millions):&#13;

 NOTE R ­ SEGMENT REPORTING&#13;
&#13;
 For management purposes, IFC's business comprises two segments: client services and treasury services. The client services segment consists&#13;
 primarily of lending, investing in debt and equity securities, and advisory services activities. Operationally, the treasury services segment consists&#13;
 of the borrowing, liquid asset management, asset and liability management and client risk management activities. Consistent with internal&#13;
 reporting, net income (expense) from asset and liability management and client risk management activities in support of client services is&#13;
 allocated to the client services segment.&#13;
&#13;
 The assessment of segment performance by senior management includes net income for each segment, return on assets, and return on capital&#13;
 employed. IFC's management reporting system and policies are used to determine revenues and expenses attributable to each segment.&#13;
 Consistent with internal reporting, administrative expenses are allocated to each segment based largely upon personnel costs and segment&#13;
 headcounts. Transactions between segments are immaterial and, thus, are not a factor in reconciling to the consolidated data.&#13;
&#13;
 The accounting policies of IFC's segments are, in all material respects, consistent with those described in Note A, "Summary of Significant&#13;
 Accounting and Related Policies."&#13;
&#13;
 An analysis of IFC's major components of income and expense by business segment for the years ended June 30, 2009, June 30, 2008, and&#13;
 June 30, 2007, is given below (US$ millions):&#13;

NOTE S ­ PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS&#13;
&#13;
IBRD, IFC and MIGA participate in a defined benefit Staff Retirement Plan (SRP), a Retired Staff Benefits Plan (RSBP) and a Post-Employment&#13;
Benefits Plan (PEBP) that cover substantially all of their staff members.&#13;
&#13;
The SRP provides regular pension benefits and includes a cash balance plan. The RSBP provides certain health and life insurance benefits to&#13;
eligible retirees. The PEBP provides certain pension benefits administered outside the SRP.&#13;
&#13;
IFC uses a June 30 measurement date for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The amounts presented below reflect IFC's&#13;
respective share of the costs, assets and liabilities of the plans.&#13;
&#13;
All costs, assets and liabilities associated with these plans are allocated between IBRD, IFC and MIGA based upon their employees' respective&#13;
participation in the plans. Costs allocated to IBRD are then shared between IBRD and IDA based on an agreed cost sharing ratio. IDA, IFC and&#13;
MIGA reimburse IBRD for their proportionate share of any contributions made to these plans by IBRD. Contributions to these plans are&#13;
calculated as a percentage of salary.&#13;
&#13;
The following table summarizes the benefit costs associated with the SRP, RSBP, and PEBP allocated to IFC for the fiscal years ended June 30,&#13;
2009, June 30, 2008, and June 30 2007 (US$ millions):&#13;

&#13;
The expenses for the SRP, RSBP, and PEBP are included in expense from pension and other postretirement benefit plans. For the years ended&#13;
June 30, 2009, June 30, 2008, and June 30, 2007, expenses for these plans of $34 million, $3 million and $16 million, respectively, were&#13;
allocated to IFC.&#13;
&#13;
The following table summarizes the projected benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets, and funded status associated with the SRP, RSBP, and&#13;
PEBP for IFC for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2009, and June 30, 2008 (US$ millions). Since the assets for the PEBP are not held in an&#13;
irrevocable trust separate from the assets of IBRD, they do not qualify for off-balance sheet accounting and are therefore included in IBRD's&#13;
investment portfolio. IFC has recognized a receivable (prepaid asset) from IBRD and a payable (liability) to IBRD equal to the amount required to&#13;
support the plan. The assets of the PEBP are invested in fixed income instruments.&#13;

 Assumptions&#13;
&#13;
 The actuarial assumptions used are based on financial market interest rates, past experience, and management's best estimate of future benefit&#13;
 changes and economic conditions. Changes in these assumptions will impact future benefit costs and obligations.&#13;
&#13;
 The expected long-term rate of return for the SRP assets is a weighted average of the expected long-term (10 years or more) returns for the&#13;
 various asset classes, weighted by the portfolio allocation. Asset class returns are developed using a forward-looking building block approach&#13;
 and are not strictly based on historical returns. Equity returns are generally developed as the sum of expected inflation, expected real earnings&#13;
 growth and expected long-term dividend yield. Bond returns are generally developed as the sum of expected inflation, real bond yield, and risk&#13;
 premium/spread (as appropriate). Other asset class returns are derived from their relationship to equity and bond markets. The expected long-&#13;
 term rate of return for the RSBP is computed using procedures similar to those used for the SRP. The discount rate used in determining the&#13;
 benefit obligation is selected by reference to the year-end AAA and AA corporate bonds.&#13;
&#13;
 Actuarial gains and losses occur when actual results are different from expected results. Amortization of these unrecognized gains and losses&#13;
 will be included in income if, at the beginning of the fiscal year, they exceed 10 percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the&#13;
 market-related value of plan assets. If required, the unrecognized gains and losses are amortized over the expected average remaining service&#13;
 lives of the employee group.&#13;
&#13;
 The following tables present the weighted-average assumptions used in determining the projected benefit obligations and the net periodic&#13;
 pension costs for the years ended June 30, 2009, June 30, 2008, and June 30, 2007:&#13;

&#13;
Investment strategy&#13;
&#13;
The investment policy for the SRP and the RSBP is to optimize the risk-return relationship as appropriate to the respective plan's needs and&#13;
goals, using a global diversified portfolio of various asset classes. Specifically, the long-term asset allocation is based on an analysis that&#13;
incorporates expected returns by asset class as well as volatilities and correlations across asset classes and the liability profile of the respective&#13;
plans, especially in case of SRP. This analysis also provides estimates of potential future contributions and future asset and liability balances.&#13;
In February 2009, the Pension Finance Committee approved an interim strategic asset allocation (reflected in the table below) for the RSBP&#13;
based on the asset allocation as of December 2008, pending resumption of work on a detailed strategic asset allocation review after market&#13;
conditions stabilize in the wake of the recent crisis. Plan assets are managed by external investment managers and monitored by IBRD's&#13;
pension investment department. The pension plan assets are invested in diversified portfolios of public equity, fixed income, and alternative&#13;
investments.&#13;

&#13;
 Expected contributions&#13;
&#13;
 IFC's contribution to the SRP and RSBP varies from year to year, as determined by the Pension Finance Committee, which bases its judgment&#13;
 on the results of annual actuarial valuations of the assets and liabilities of the SRP and RSBP. The best estimate of the amount of contributions&#13;
 expected to be paid to the SRP and RSBP for IFC during the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2009, is $49 million and $18 million, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 NOTE T ­ SERVICE AND SUPPORT PAYMENTS&#13;
&#13;
 IFC obtains certain administrative and overhead services from IBRD in those areas where common services can be efficiently provided by IBRD.&#13;
 This includes shared costs of the Boards of Governors and Directors, and other services such as communications, internal auditing,&#13;
 administrative support, supplies, and insurance. IFC makes payments for these services to IBRD based on negotiated fees, chargebacks and&#13;
 allocated charges, where chargeback is not feasible. Expenses allocated to IFC for the year ended June 30, 2009, were $41 million ($34 million -&#13;
 year ended June 30, 2008; $28 million - year ended June 30, 2007).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 NOTE U ­ MANAGEMENT OF TRUST FUNDS&#13;
&#13;
 IFC administers funds received from and on behalf of donors and/or partners (Trust Funds) that are restricted for specific uses in accordance&#13;
 with applicable administration agreements and/or fiscal agency agreements. Specified uses could include, for example, Advisory Services work&#13;
 including feasibility studies, project preparation, implementation of global and regional programs, and research and training programs. IFC may&#13;
 also make contributions to these specific uses of funds in accordance with terms approved by IFC's Board. The IFC contributions can be&#13;
 commingled with donor funds under administration in accordance with administration agreements with donors or fiscal agency agreements,&#13;
 where applicable. The IFC contributions and donor funds are placed in trust and are held in a separate investment portfolio, managed by IBRD,&#13;
 which is not commingled with IFC's liquid assets. IFC funding is included in the consolidated balance sheet of IFC until such time as IFC cedes&#13;
 control of the funds to the recipient.&#13;
&#13;
 Execution may be carried out through: a recipient-executed trust fund, an IFC-executed trust fund or a financial intermediary fund.&#13;
&#13;
 IFC-executed Trust Funds involve IFC execution of activities as described in relevant administration agreements or IFC Board documents,&#13;
 which define the terms and conditions for use of the funds. Spending authority is exercised by IFC, subject to any restrictions contained in the&#13;
 administration agreements.&#13;
&#13;
 Recipient-executed Trust Funds involve activities carried out by a recipient third-party "executing agency." IFC enters into agreements with and&#13;
 disburses funds to these recipients, who then exercise spending authority to meet the objectives and comply with terms stipulated in the&#13;
 agreements.&#13;
&#13;
 IFC also enters into financial intermediary fund arrangements under which IFC's services are limited to the role of fiscal agent pursuant to a&#13;
 fiscal agency agreement. Funds are held and disbursed in accordance with the fiscal agency agreement. Trust Fund assets at June 30, 2009,&#13;
 and June 30, 2008, including $187 million at June 30, 2009 ($176 million at June 30, 2008) of funds provided by IFC in its capacity as a donor,&#13;
 are summarized below (US$ millions):&#13;

 NOTE V ­ CONTINGENCIES&#13;
&#13;
 In the normal course of its business, IFC is from time to time named as a defendant or co-defendant in various legal actions on different grounds&#13;
 in various jurisdictions. Although there can be no assurances, based on the information currently available, IFC's Management does not believe&#13;
 the outcome of any of the various existing legal actions will have a material adverse effect on IFC's financial position, results of operations or cash&#13;
 flows.&#13;

NOTE W ­ VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES AND OTHER CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS&#13;
&#13;
Subsidiaries&#13;
&#13;
IFC has established a wholly-owned subsidiary, IFC Asset Management Company, LLP to manage two Funds - IFC Capitalization (Equity)&#13;
Fund, L.P. (the Equity Fund); and IFC Capitalization (Subordinated Debt) Fund, L.P. (the Sub-Debt Fund) (collectively, the Funds). The&#13;
purpose of the Funds is to make investments in eligible banks. IFC is a limited partner, and IFC Capitalization (Equity) Fund (GP), LLC, a&#13;
wholly-owned subsidiary of IFC, is the general partner of the Equity Fund. IFC is a limited partner and IFC Capitalization (Subordinated Debt)&#13;
Fund (GP), LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of IFC, is the general partner of the Sub-Debt Fund. IFC intends to invest $775 million in the Equity&#13;
Fund and $225 million in the Sub-Debt Fund, subject to IFC Board of Directors approval of IFC's pro rata share of investments to be made by&#13;
the Funds.&#13;
&#13;
The establishment of these entities in January 2009 did not have a material impact on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows&#13;
of IFC in the year ended June 30, 2009.&#13;
&#13;
Variable interest entities&#13;
&#13;
An entity is subject to FIN 46R and is called a variable interest entity (VIE) if it lacks: (1) equity that is sufficient to permit the entity to finance its&#13;
activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties; or (2) equity investors who have decision-making rights about the&#13;
entity's operations or if it has equity investors who do not absorb the expected losses or receive the expected returns of the entity proportionally&#13;
to their voting rights.&#13;
&#13;
A VIE is consolidated by its primary beneficiary, which is the party involved with the VIE that absorbs a majority of the expected losses or&#13;
receives a majority of the expected residual returns or both. The primary beneficiary is required to initially measure the assets, liabilities and&#13;
non controlling interests of the VIE at their carrying amounts at the date on which it becomes the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is&#13;
also required to disclose information about the nature, purpose, size, and activities of the VIE, and collateral and recourse creditors may have&#13;
against the VIE.&#13;
&#13;
An enterprise may hold significant variable interests in VIEs, which are not consolidated because the enterprise is not the primary beneficiary.&#13;
In such cases, the enterprise is required to disclose information about its involvement with and exposure to the VIE, and about the nature,&#13;
purpose, size, and activities of the VIE.&#13;
&#13;
An enterprise is not required to apply FIN 46R to certain entities if, after making an exhaustive effort, it is unable to obtain the information&#13;
necessary to: (1) determine whether the entity is a VIE; (2) determine if the enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the possible VIE; or (3)&#13;
perform the accounting required to consolidate a possible VIE. In such cases, the enterprise is required to disclose the number of entities to&#13;
which FIN 46R is not being applied, why the information required to apply FIN 46R is not available, the nature, purpose and activities of the&#13;
entities to which FIN 46R is not being applied, and the enterprise's maximum exposure to the entities to which FIN 46R is not being applied.&#13;
&#13;
Primary beneficiary&#13;
&#13;
IFC has identified five VIEs in which IFC is deemed to be the primary beneficiary at June 30, 2009.&#13;
&#13;
Two of the VIEs have been consolidated into IFC's consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2009. All consolidated VIEs are in the&#13;
Collective investment vehicles sector in the Latin America and Caribbean region.&#13;
&#13;
As a result of the consolidation of the two investments described above, IFC's consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2009 includes additional&#13;
assets of $10 million in equity investments ($20 million - June 30, 2008), $0 in receivables and other assets ($1 million - June 30, 2008), and&#13;
additional liabilities of $3 million in payables and other liabilities ($4 million - June 30, 2008).&#13;
&#13;
Other income totaled $2 million during the year ended June 30, 2009 ($7 million - year ended June 30, 2008 and $7 million - year ended June&#13;
30, 2007). Other expenses totaled $12 million during the year ended June 30, 2009 ($1 million - year ended June 30, 2008 and $2 million - year&#13;
ended June 30, 2007).&#13;
&#13;
The remaining three VIEs in which IFC is deemed to be the primary beneficiary have not been consolidated into IFC's consolidated financial&#13;
statements, as they are significantly impaired and information required to apply the provisions of FIN 46R is not available. Based on the most&#13;
recent financial data available, total net assets of the three entities is $1 million. IFC's net investments in these three entities totals $10 million,&#13;
and virtually are all in the Primary metals sector in the Asia region.&#13;
&#13;
Significant variable interests&#13;
&#13;
IFC has identified 83 investments in VIEs in which IFC is not the primary beneficiary but in which it is deemed to hold significant variable&#13;
interests at June 30, 2009 (49 investments - June 30, 2008). Based on the most recent available data from these VIEs, the size including&#13;
committed funding of the VIEs in which IFC is deemed to hold significant variable interests totaled $9,552 million at June 30, 2009 ($5,136&#13;
million - June 30, 2008). IFC's total investment in and maximum exposure to loss to these investments in VIEs in which IFC is deemed to hold&#13;
significant variable interests, comprising both disbursed amounts and amounts committed but not yet disbursed, was $2,817 million at June 30,&#13;
2009 ($1,201 million - June 30, 2008).&#13;

    Under the Global Trade Finance Program, IFC provides guarantee cov-&#13;
erage of bank risk in emerging markets, where confirming banks need&#13;
risk mitigation to support their export clients because of limited capacity&#13;
for country and bank exposure.&#13;
    Structure finance mobilization is a feature of selected guarantee, loan,&#13;
and equity transactions, but is not included in the total committed for&#13;
these projects. The mobilization number covers the full amount at the&#13;
project commitment date.&#13;

          NOTE ON C ATEGOR IZ ATION OF PROJECTS :&#13;
&#13;
Projects are assigned a category of A, B, or C, according to their potential&#13;
environmental and social impacts, or as FI, in the case of investments&#13;
through financial intermediaries that on-lend to clients whose projects&#13;
may present environmental and social risks.&#13;
&#13;
Category A: Projects with potential significant adverse social or environ-&#13;
mental impacts that are diverse, irreversible, or unprecedented.&#13;
&#13;
Category B: Projects with potential limited adverse social or environmen-&#13;
tal impacts that are few in number, generally site-specific, largely revers-&#13;
ible, and readily addressed through mitigation measures.&#13;
&#13;
Category C: Projects with minimal or no adverse social or environmental&#13;
impacts, including certain financial intermediary (FI) projects with mini-&#13;
mal or no adverse risks.&#13;
&#13;
Category FI: All FI projects excluding those that are Category C proj-&#13;
ects. FI projects are required to establish and maintain a Social and&#13;
Environmental Management System to ensure that their investments&#13;
meet IFC's requirements.&#13;

&#13;
1 Commitments are composed of funds to be provided by IFC for its own account, funds to be provided by participants through the purchase of an interest in IFC's investment, and funds to be provided by&#13;
  other financial institutions in association with IFC, where IFC has rendered material assistance in mobilizing these funds. Original commitments are composed of disbursed and undisbursed balances. The&#13;
  undisbursed portion is revalued at current exchange rate, while the disbursed portion represents the cost of the commitment at the time of disbursement. Loans held for IFC are revalued at the current&#13;
  exchange rates. Amounts shown are for commitments outstanding at June 30, 2009, net of cancellations.&#13;
2 Investments held for IFC comprise the sum of the disbursed and outstanding balance together and the undisbursed balance of signed commitments, net of cancellations and before write-off&#13;
  and other adjustments.&#13;
3 The total IFC portfolio for its own account is composed of loan, equity, guarantee, and risk-management products held for IFC's own account (it includes write-offs and other adjustments).&#13;
* Projects marked with an asterisk (*): IFC's investments in unincorporated oil-and-gas joint ventures (UJVs) are accounted for under the cost recovery method, as more fully described in Note A to the&#13;
  Corporation's FY09 consolidated financial statements. For the UJVs, investments held for IFC comprise the sum of the inception-to-date cash disbursements, net of cash receipts (until cost is recovered) plus&#13;
  the undisbursed balance of signed commitments, net of cancellations.&#13;
&#13;
Notes&#13;
"-" means less than $50,000.&#13;
The operational investments are represented by loans and equity, as stated. In addition, in certain investments, IFC has the right to acquire shares and/or participate in the profits of the enterprise.&#13;
Certain investments reported as loan or equity with debt-like features have been separately reported as debt securities on IFC's consolidated balance sheet.&#13;

notes and definitions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The fiscal year at IFC runs from July 1 to June 30. Thus, FY09 began on&#13;
July 1, 2008, and ended on June 30, 2009.&#13;
    Investment amounts are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise specified.&#13;
    On-lending is the process of lending funds from IFC's own sources&#13;
through intermediaries, such as local banks and microfinance institutions.&#13;
    Loan participants and IFC fully share the commercial credit risks of&#13;
projects but, because IFC is the lender of record, participants receive the&#13;
same tax and country risk benefits that IFC derives from its special status&#13;
as a multilateral financial institution.&#13;
    Quasi-equity instruments incorporate both loan and equity features,&#13;
which are designed to provide varying degrees of risk/return trade-offs&#13;
that lie between those of straight loan and equity investments.&#13;
    Rounding of numbers may cause totals to differ from the sum of indi-&#13;
vidual figures in some tables.&#13;
    The World Bank includes the International Bank for Reconstruction&#13;
and Development and the International Development Association. The&#13;
World Bank Group includes IBRD, IDA, IFC, the Multilateral Investment&#13;
Guarantee Agency, and the International Centre for Settlement of&#13;
Investment Disputes.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            International Finance Corporation (IFC)
            is an international organization, established in 1956, to
            further economic growth in its developing member countries
            by promoting private sector development. IFC's
            principal investment products are loans and equity
            investments, with smaller debt securities and guarantee
            portfolios. IFC also plays a catalytic role in mobilizing
            additional funding from other investors and lenders, either
            through co financing or through loan participations,
            underwritings, and guarantees. In addition to project
            finance, corporate lending and resource mobilization, IFC
            offers an array of financial products and advisory services
            to private businesses in the developing world to increase
            their chances of success. It also advises governments on how
            to create an environment hospitable to the growth of private
            enterprise and foreign investment. IFC raises virtually all
            of the funds for its lending activities through the issuance
            of debt obligations in the international capital markets,
            while maintaining a small borrowing window with
            International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
            (IBRD). The management discussion and analysis contains
            forward looking statements which may be identified by such
            terms as 'anticipates,' 'believes,'
            'expects,' 'intends,' 'plans'
            or words of similar meaning. Such statements involve a
            number of assumptions and estimates that are based on
            current expectations, which are subject to risks and
            uncertainties beyond IFC's control. Consequently,
            actual future results could differ materially from those
            currently anticipated.
