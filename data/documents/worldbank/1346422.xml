Nigeria, and South&#13;
Africa                  and regulatory implications of those trends for developing countries. The&#13;
question facing policymakers is whether the emergence of multi-utilities&#13;
should be encouraged as a means of improving access and quality of&#13;
utility services-or subjected to closer control to guard against&#13;
potential dangers arising from  less competition, greater regulatory&#13;
complexity, and more concentrated political power in the utilities.&#13;
For the past 20 years, governments have sought    Lower costs, increased convenience&#13;

            Some utilities have responded to recent
            changes in technology and market liberalization by turning
            themselves into "multi-utilities" that bundle
            traditionally distinct services. A companion Note reviews
            recent trends in horizontal integration of utilities. This
            Note looks at the policy and regulatory implications of
            those trends for developing countries. The question facing
            policymakers is whether the emergence of multi-utilities
            should be encouraged as a means of improving access and
            quality of utility services -- or subjected to closer
            control to guard against potential dangers arising from less
            competition, greater regulatory complexity, and more
            concentrated political power in the utilities.
