        <abstracts>
            Depositors protection has become an
            important feature of most banking systems. Deposit insurance
            is a common approach -nearly all industrialized countries
            now have formal deposit insurance systems, although the form
            and scope of insurance systems differ significantly from one
            country to the next. Deposit insurance is now taking hold in
            developing countries as well. About a dozen developing
            countries have adopted these schemes, and others are
            considering whether and how to do so. However, deposit
            insurance is not the only way to protect depositors. Another
            option is so-called implicit depositor protection, which
            usually means taxpayers banks that would otherwise fail. The
            author looks first at whether or not protection is a good
            idea. Then he reviews the strengths and weaknesses of
            insurance-based or implicit systems and then suggests some
            good design rules for governments that choose the insurance option.
