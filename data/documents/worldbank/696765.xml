        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In the wake of the Mexican financial
            crisis, too much attention has been given to what was
            happening in emerging economies and too little to what was
            changing in financial markets.  What are these changes?
            First, much of the capital flow to emerging markets is now
            in the form of bonds and portfolio equity investment.
            Second, investors managing these flows are attracted to
            high-risk, high-return opportunities and are less patient
            than the foreign direct investors or banks that emerging
            market governments may have been more used to dealing with.
            Third, these investors have no way of communicating their
            patience level to policymakers other than by exiting.  And
            fourth, high information costs tend to concentrate these
            flows in "hot" countries and lead investors to
            rely on a few knowledgeable observers to signal when their
            returns are at risk, adding to the potential volatility.
            This Note attempts to explain the origins of volatility, how
            volatility affects emerging market investors, and the
            economic management implications behind the changes.  In the
            wake of volatile global capital flows, the World Bank too
            must reconsider its role in its assistance to client countries.
