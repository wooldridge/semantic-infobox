            Competition policy : encouraging thriving
            markets for development
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            A literature review shows that
            competition policy reforms allow markets to work more
            efficiently for the benefit of consumers and drive
            sustainable economic growth. Three main insights emerge:
            greater market competition matters for achieving greater
            innovation, productivity, and economic growth. Policies that
            help open markets and remove anticompetitive regulations can
            promote competition, resulting in lower prices and better
            deals for consumers and firms. And effective enforcement of
            competition rules across sectors, rather than the pure
            existence of competition laws, makes a difference in the
            impact of competition policies.
