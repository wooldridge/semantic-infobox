REPUBLIC OF BENIN&#13;
TRANSPORT SECTOR INVESTMENT PROGRAM&#13;
Credit and Program Summary&#13;
Borrower:                Republic of Benin&#13;
Beneficiaries:           Ministry of Transport and Public Works (MTPT) for&#13;
US$34.7 M and Port Authority of Cotonou (PAC) for&#13;
US$5.3 M&#13;
Poverty:                 The project does not include specific targeted interventions&#13;
to reduce poverty. It will however have a significant&#13;
impact on poverty alleviation through the reduction of&#13;
transport costs, part of which would be transferred to rural&#13;
farmers in higher farm-gate prices. The program will also&#13;
improve access to social services, and will create&#13;
construction and maintenance jobs in the private sector.&#13;
Credit Amount:           SDR 27.5 million (US$40.0 M equivalent)&#13;
Terms:                   Standard IDA terms, with 40 years' maturity&#13;
Onlending Terms:         Two-thirds as standard commercial loan terms (7.1 percent)&#13;
and one-third as equity to Port Authority.&#13;
Project Description:     Periodic road maintenance is the top priority item in the&#13;
1997-2001 Government Transport Program which amounts&#13;
to CFA franc 247 billion. The main components of the&#13;
Sector Investment Program are: (a) Paved Road&#13;
Construction, Rehabilitation and Maintenance: CFA&#13;
franc 134 billion for paving and CFA franc 51 billion for&#13;
rehabilitation and periodic maintenance and support for&#13;
restructuring of the road sector management to insure&#13;
adequate maintenance; (b) Unpaved Road Rehabilitation&#13;
and Maintenance: CFA franc 10.5 billion for&#13;
rehabilitation and CFA franc 8.5 billion for periodic&#13;
maintenance; (c) Institutional Strengthening for Road&#13;
Network Management: CFA franc 4 billion for technical&#13;
assistance and training; (d) Feeder Roads with CFA franc&#13;
15.5 billion for road building; (e) Port and Maritime&#13;
Improvements, with CFA franc 18 billion for port&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iv -&#13;
operations improvements; and (f) Airport Rehabilitation,&#13;
with CFA franc 3.5 billion for critical runway&#13;
rehabilitation. Of the CFA franc 247 billion required to&#13;
finance the program, CFA franc 140 billion has already&#13;
been pledged by donors, a further CFA franc 28 billion is&#13;
currently under negotiation, and CFA franc 63 billion is&#13;
projected to be secured from donors during the program&#13;
period. IDA's US$40 M credit, which is included in the&#13;
CFA franc 140 billion pledged (8 percent of total program)&#13;
supports important Government policy commitments as&#13;
well as port and road works and is allocated as follows:&#13;
Port Operations and Management, US$5.7 M (13&#13;
percent of IDA Credit); Road Repair, Maintenance,&#13;
Safety and Network Management, US$32.1 M (71&#13;
percent); Rural Road Rehabilitation and Management,&#13;
US$3.1 M (7 percent); and Urban Road Improvements&#13;
and Traffic Management, US$4.3 M (9 percent).&#13;
Financing Plan:          IDA: US$40.0 M&#13;
Benin: US$5.2 M of which US$2.2 M by the Road Fund,&#13;
US$0.4 M PAC, and US$0.3 M beneficiaries, and US$2.3&#13;
M by the National Budget.&#13;
Benefits:                In the port, improvements in productivity yield shipper&#13;
savings in road transport cost, incurred when port&#13;
congestion in Cotonou diverts traffic to Lome, and physical&#13;
improvements in the port yield cost savings for cargo-&#13;
handling equipment. On national, rural and urban roads,&#13;
improved road surfaces yield vehicle operating cost&#13;
savings. On these bases, estimated cost savings from IDA-&#13;
supported port improvements yield an economic rate of&#13;
return (ERR) of 250 percent and a net present value (NPV)&#13;
of US$74 M. Unpaved road works to be funded under the&#13;
IDA Credit (52 percent of such works in program) show a&#13;
cost-weighted ERR of 103 percent and a NPV of US$67 M.&#13;
Other non-quantified but no less real benefits are expected&#13;
to flow from program-supported activities which promote&#13;
improvements in management and planning, effective use&#13;
of the five-year priority program as an investment tool,&#13;
development of a community-based, demand-driven rural&#13;
roads rehabilitation and maintenance strategy, better&#13;
contract management and better planning based on better&#13;
road data. Safety and traffic management activities will&#13;
reduce the cost of traffic accidents, in terms of human life&#13;
and productivity and damage to vehicles.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- v -&#13;
Risks:                  Given that the program has been designed to build on&#13;
existing positive initiatives and achievements in the sector,&#13;
IDA component risks are limited to new and innovative&#13;
activities introduced under the IDA components. These&#13;
are: (a) inadequate replenishment of Road Fund - ftnding&#13;
sources to be diversified through road tolls, return of&#13;
authority for direct collection of funds to Road Fund staff,&#13;
and gradual reduction of general budget support are&#13;
measures taken to reduce the likelihood of this risk; (b)&#13;
slow restructuring of DROA - restructuring has already&#13;
been accepted and assimilated by DROA staff and has led&#13;
the design of the reorganization process; (c) involvement of&#13;
local communities and NGOs - mobilization and&#13;
effectiveness of local communities will be increased&#13;
through the support of international NGOs under the close&#13;
supervision of IDA; and (d) continuous adherence of&#13;
donors to the priority program - donors agreed on the&#13;
Transport Sector Strategy and donor round table meeting&#13;
will be held every other year.&#13;

1. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   This is the first time that an integrated sector-wide investment approach has&#13;
been adopted for the sustainable development of a sector in Benin. IDA's Credit&#13;
together with pledges from other donors, would support implementation of the 1996-&#13;
2000 Transport Sector Priority Investment Program (the program) developed as part of&#13;
the Transport Sector Strategy. The sector approach:&#13;
* covers all the subsectors which still rely on Government financing or&#13;
guarantees;&#13;
*  makes optimal use of resources in order to achieve a sustainable equilibrium&#13;
between infrastructure maintenance and conventional capital investment,&#13;
including rehabilitation and network expansion;&#13;
&#149;  gives sector management priority over investment;&#13;
*  has been prepared on the basis of broad consultation among local&#13;
stakeholders (Government authorities and private and public road users) and&#13;
donors active in the sector, with Government acting as leader;&#13;
*  is supported by all donors active in the sector; and&#13;
*  promotes standardized implementation procedures.&#13;
1.2   Previous projects supported by the Bank and other donors have sought to&#13;
improve road maintenance and sector performance, while financing port and road&#13;
construction and rehabilitation. Economic liberalization beginning in 1991 made&#13;
possible a rapid pace in transport sector policy reform. The ensuing economic revival&#13;
and dramatic increase in transport demand stimulated internal reorganizations and&#13;
adoption of more efficient road maintenance approaches, but also highlighted the need&#13;
for closer donor coordination and a more consistent coordination across subsectors, in&#13;
order to avoid overinvesting. The transport sector strategy and the associated priority&#13;
expenditure program provide a basis for such coordination and consistency. Together&#13;
they address the issues which continue to hamper sector productivity despite recent&#13;
progress, in particular road maintenance financing and overall port management. The&#13;
implementation of the strategy and program will bring a new dimension to recent&#13;
Government initiatives, with a view to improving Benin's comparative advantage and&#13;
competitiveness as a transit corridor to the Sahel.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B. MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT&#13;
1.3   Strategically positioned between Nigeria and French-speaking African countries&#13;
on the Gulf of Guinea, Benin is a small, narrow country with a long history as a regional&#13;
trading center. A natural transport corridor for landlocked Niger and western Nigeria,&#13;
Benin's highly open economy and low transport costs give it unquestionable advantages&#13;
in the transit trade to and from the Sahel in spite of facilitation difficulties within the&#13;
country. Beninese traders are also well placed to play the intermediary between the&#13;
huge Nigerian market and Benin's francophone neighbors. About 60 percent of its five&#13;
million residents live in villages and are primarily farmers, while about 40 percent live&#13;
in the two coastal centers, Cotonou, capital and port city (700,000) and Porto-Novo&#13;
(200,000) and in upcountry towns along the road to Niger.&#13;
1.4    With per capita income of about US$372 in 1995, Benin is somewhat better off&#13;
than its neighbors (Niger, Nigeria, Togo) but remains one of the ten least developed&#13;
countries in the world according to the United Nations Development Programme&#13;
(UNDP) human development index. Real GDP per capita has been increasing since&#13;
1991 and is expected to increase at 2.5 percent annually from 1995. Benin's principal&#13;
resources are its arable land and its trading capabilities, supported by an adequate&#13;
transport infrastructure. The primary sector accounts for about 35 percent of GDP,&#13;
more than 70 percent of exports--mostly cotton-- and 75 percent of employment, and&#13;
grew at 5.4 percent per annum during 1992-95. Food production (about 69 percent of&#13;
primary sector output and 25 percent of GDP) currently exceeds domestic consumption&#13;
(excluding rice), and the country is potentially self-sufficient in food. The tertiary&#13;
sector (52 percent of GDP) consists of vigorous trading, services and transport&#13;
activities, some formal but mostly informal, growing at an annual rate of 3.6 percent. A&#13;
small industrial sector (12 percent of GDP) features cotton processing, textiles and&#13;
cement production, and exploitation of limited offshore oil resources.&#13;
1.5   The devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994 has generated a strong supply&#13;
response. Led by good performance in cotton, textiles, and construction, real GDP grew&#13;
an estimated 3.6 percent in 1994 and 5.8 percent in 1995, one of the highest rates in the&#13;
CFA franc zone, and the overall impact on Benin's balance of payments of the January&#13;
1994 CFA franc exchange rate realignment has been positive. In contrast to the&#13;
political instability and economic stagnation of the 1970s and 1980s, when trade was&#13;
slow and productive sectors were poorly managed, a steady pace of economic reform&#13;
beginning in 1989 has resulted in overall economic revival, most visible in increased&#13;
road and port traffic in Cotonou and the opening of five new commercial banks. With&#13;
support from IDA under two structural adjustment credits, the role of the State in the&#13;
economy has been substantially reduced in favor of promoting private sector activities.&#13;
Government reinforced its adjustment strategy in connection with the 1994 exchange&#13;
rate adjustment, and recent reforms, including deregulation of private sector activities&#13;
and tax simplification, are contributing to increased private capital inflows. The main&#13;
objectives of the reinforced adjustment strategy, supported by a third structural&#13;
adjustment Credit (SAL III) approved in FY95, are: (a) faster GDP growth, with a target&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
of 5-6 percent in real terms from 1995; (b) reduced dependence on foreign assistance&#13;
through balanced budgets and improved balance of payments; (c) reduced poverty and&#13;
better social services delivery; and (d) rehabilitated social and physical infrastructure&#13;
and better human resource development.&#13;
C. DEVELOPMENT CONSTRAINTS AND BROAD OBJECTIVES&#13;
1.6   The road to recovery has not been easy and there remain serious economic&#13;
difficulties in all sectors. Benin's strategic objectives involve addressing generic issues&#13;
to development which apply across all sectors, namely: (a) regional competitiveness: a&#13;
relative lack of competitiveness in production. limiting export growth; (b) investment&#13;
policy: a low level of investment and continuing inefficiencies in public investment; (c)&#13;
expenditure policy: a structure of public expenditures favoring payroll over maintenance&#13;
and operations; (d) fiscal policy: a low level of domestic savings and limited financial&#13;
intermediation; (e) private sector: remaining disincentives to the expansion of private&#13;
sector economic activities; (f) capacity building: inadequate human resource&#13;
management, and a still substantial and relatively inefficient public sector; and (g)&#13;
environmental and poverty aspects: widespread soil erosion and the vulnerability of&#13;
low-income groups, which require attention if any economic growth strategy is to be&#13;
sustainable in the long run.&#13;
1.7   IDA's involvement in the transport sector investment program is consistent with&#13;
the broader objectives of the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed with the&#13;
Board in June 1994, which are to encourage and support private sector supply response&#13;
and ensure adequate provision of basic social services. The program directly supports&#13;
these objectives by: (a) creating an enabling environment for private sector activities&#13;
through reduction of transport costs and further liberalization and privatization of&#13;
transport operations; (b) supporting provision of basic social services by improving road&#13;
infrastructure, mainly rural, and urban transport management; (c) and supporting&#13;
agriculture sector growth by facilitating access to remote rural areas, which will also&#13;
help reduce poverty. A comprehensive Transport Sector Strategy prepared in 1994&#13;
using a broad participatory approach gave birth to the investment program. The&#13;
program, which is included in the CAS "base case" lending program, will help promote&#13;
sound economic management through a better balance between investment and&#13;
maintenance. It will promote consistent investment choices based on support to&#13;
economic growth. Finally, the use of sectoral environmental guidelines in the&#13;
program's execution will support the environmental strategy as defined in the National&#13;
Environmental Plan.&#13;

2. TRANSPORTATION IN BENIN&#13;
A. TRANSPORT SECTOR CONTEXT&#13;
2.1   Role of the Transport Sector in the Economy. Benin's prosperity depends&#13;
heavily on trade and transport, and its transport sector is a major contributor to national&#13;
income. The formal transport sector accounted for 8 percent of GDP in 1995, but nearly&#13;
two-thirds of Beninese are involved in trade and related services, mostly through&#13;
informal sector, medium- and small-scale enterprises. Most urban residents earn their&#13;
living primarily from trade, and the efficiency of transport also has a major impact on&#13;
agricultural development.&#13;
2.2   Demand Structure. The transport sector is organized to meet three principal&#13;
aspects of demand: domestic cotton exports, transit traffic and trade with neighboring&#13;
countries, and internal trade between towns and rural areas. The primary sector&#13;
represents 35 percent of GDP, and agricultural products, especially cotton, make up the&#13;
bulk of export transport demand. Transit traffic is the second largest category of freight&#13;
transport demand. About 15 percent of all road traffic in vehlkm terms is international&#13;
in nature; half of this is traffic going to or from the port, and the other half is passing&#13;
through Benin (origin and destination outside the country). During the 1991-94 period,&#13;
14 percent, 5.4 percent and 2.4 percent of imports through the port of Cotonou were&#13;
officially destined for Niger, Nigeria or Togo, and Burkina Faso, respectively. Transit&#13;
demand is subject to considerable variation as a function of transport costs, but also in&#13;
response to volatile political and economic situations in the subregion, where changes in&#13;
import regulations and port operations and efficiency can cause dramatic shifts among&#13;
competing routes.&#13;
2.3   Network Structure. The country's shape takes the form of an elongated&#13;
corridor 800 km long and 300 km wide. The anchor of this north-south axis is the port&#13;
of Cotonou and its backbone is the Cotonou-Save-Parakou-Malanville road, a 790 km,&#13;
two-lane paved road, paralleled for about half of its length by the Cotonou-Parakou&#13;
metric rail line (see IBRD Map 27430). Road transport is centered around the port of&#13;
Cotonou. From Parakou, a two-lane gravel road which is currently being paved,&#13;
branches off to the west, through Natitingou, towards the border with Burkina Faso.&#13;
These main roads allow for the outflow of cotton from the main production centers to&#13;
the port. Two other main east-west roads, a coastal road from Lome to Lagos, and&#13;
another located about 150 km north of Cotonou through Bohicon, are the main links to&#13;
Nigeria and Togo.&#13;
2.4   Transport Modes. For reasons of cost and availability, road transport is the&#13;
dominant mode. Virtually all passengers (93 percent) and 73 percent of goods are&#13;
carried by road, the remaining traffic being handled by the railway. The modal split for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
freight is about 50/50 on the Cotonou and Parakou where rail and road run side by side.&#13;
Rail traffic on this line has been faced with increased competition since the recent&#13;
paving of the gravel road between Save and Parakou. The market for air transport is&#13;
limited by the small size of the domestic market.&#13;
2.5    Transport Infrastructure. Investment in infrastructure has created adequate&#13;
networks in all modes. The total length of the road network is around 16,200 km. It&#13;
consists of 3,425 km of national roads, including interurban highways and primary&#13;
urban roads, 10,900 km of rural roads and around 1,800 km of municipal roads&#13;
(secondary and tertiary roads in urban areas). Eighty percent of the national road&#13;
network carries more than 50 vehicles a day, qualifying as the "priority" network, and&#13;
40 percent of the national road network is paved, including paving of Parakou-&#13;
Natitingou now underway (218 km, financed by the European Union, BID, Kuwaiti&#13;
Fund, BOAD, OPEP, CDEAO). The role of Benin as a transit corridor is apparent in its&#13;
network classification: international roads represent 64 percent, or 2,178 km, of the&#13;
national road network. Table 2.1 below shows the respective lengths of each network.&#13;

Total, All Networks         1,517     6,808        7,827        16,152&#13;
About 20 km of the national road network are primary roads within Cotonou.&#13;
2.6    The port of Cotonou has a loading/unloading capacity of around 2.3 million&#13;
tons, given present operational practices, sufficient to meet demand until 1998; if&#13;
productivity can be raised to international standards, it could be sufficient until 2001.&#13;
Present port facilities consist essentially of 7 berths in deep water. The rail network is&#13;
constituted by a single metric track between Cotonou and Parakou (438 km). The&#13;
railway has a capacity of 600,000 tons, well above the 340,000 tons average annual&#13;
traffic forecast over the next five years. An arrangement with a truck pool allows the&#13;
rail shipments to complete their journey to Niger by truck (Parakou-Malanville-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -&#13;
Niamey). The main runway at Cotonou international airport is 2,400 m long and 45 m&#13;
wide and requires reinforcement now. Runway, taxiways, and parking areas of Cotonou&#13;
airport were rehabilitated at the end of 1995. There are seven domestic airports serving&#13;
Parakou, Kandi, Natitingou, Save, Porga, Benbereke, and Djougou. These are equipped&#13;
with laterite runways, but have no night landing lights.&#13;
2.7   Trends in Road Traffic and Demand. Between 1987 and 1995, road traffic&#13;
registered an overall increase at the very high rate of 9 percent on paved roads and 6&#13;
percent on unpaved roads. Such strong growth was the result of both the political and&#13;
economic changes which occurred in Benin and the increase of trade transit since 1991&#13;
at the expense of the Togo corridor. Growth is twice as high for passengers than for&#13;
goods, and accident rates are among the highest in Africa. The interurban network is&#13;
adequate to face traffic increases, but the primary network in Cotonou is congested on&#13;
some sections.&#13;
2.8   Urban passenger transport demand in Cotonou is estimated at 390,000 trips per&#13;
weekday, based on the average daily taxi and mototaxi earnings. The modal split is&#13;
dominated by mototaxis which carry 81 percent of trips. For all shared modes, average&#13;
mobility is 0.6 trips per resident per day, a relatively high trip rate compared to that&#13;
observed in African cities with good bus networks. This high mobility is due to the&#13;
high level of commercial activity in Cotonou and a strong supply response, particularly&#13;
from the informal sector. In the city of Cotonou alone, there are an estimated 60,000&#13;
two-wheelers, of which 30 percent are used as taxis for public transport in the city&#13;
(compared to a total domestic vehicle fleet estimated at 42,000 units in 1994).&#13;
2.9   Traffic through the port of Cotonou is characterized by wide annual variations.&#13;
Annual port traffic volumes peaked in 1979 at 1.5 M T in response to overflow from&#13;
saturation of the port of Lagos, and in 1993 at 1.75 M T due to the virtual shutdown of&#13;
the port of Lome, because of the political situation in Togo. Since 1989, traffic has&#13;
steadily increased from 900,000 T to 2.050 M T in 1995. Used vehicle imports have&#13;
been a major growth factor: annual imports of used vehicles from Europe through the&#13;
port of Cotonou increased more than tenfold in four years, from 3,500 in 1988 to 40,000&#13;
in 1992, and Benin has become a very active regional repair and distribution center for&#13;
used vehicles. The port authority's operating plan for 1995-2000 is based on a realistic&#13;
overall annual growth rate of 4.8 percent for port traffic. If no change occurs in&#13;
operating practices, saturation would be reached at 2.3 M T (in 1998) but if perforrnance&#13;
improves to the standards of other ports in the region, saturation would be reached at 2.7&#13;
M T (2001). In other words, under present operating conditions, expected traffic levels&#13;
could not be handled by 1998.&#13;
2.10  Demand for air travel is increasing slowly. Traffic forecasts indicate a volume&#13;
of about 280,000 passengers by the year 2000 compared to about 245,000 passengers in&#13;
1994. Most traffic is actually international travel and domestic demand for air travel is&#13;
quite low due to short travel distances and the failure of domestic air carriers. Benin is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
not a major tourist destination; what regional tourism does arrive, originates from&#13;
Nigeria and Togo and relies mainly on the road network.&#13;
2.11  Transport Sector Financing. Revenues from taxes and fees collected from the&#13;
transport sector amounted to nearly CFA franc 3.7 billion in 1990 and CFA franc 6.9&#13;
billion in 1993, with 1994 revenues estimated at CFA franc 5.7 billion. Resources&#13;
allocated directly or through the Treasury in 1994 to the Road Fund represent around 40&#13;
percent of these revenues (CFA franc 2.4 billion). In order to survive in a competitive&#13;
market, carriers have resorted to tax evasion, The low tax collection is mostly due to&#13;
illegal fuel imports (80 percent of all fuel consumption from 1991-94 and 70 percent in&#13;
1995), estimated to be as much as CFA franc 8 billion. An additional CFA franc 2.5&#13;
billion is lost from uncollected customs duties on imported cars, and CFA franc 0.5&#13;
billion from other evaded taxes. Only road tolls are collected from both formal and&#13;
informal sectors in a fair manner. In this area, Benin is performing well, collecting&#13;
about 20 percent of the Road Fund resources through road tolls.&#13;
B. PUBLIC AND PRIVATE STAKEHOLDERS&#13;
Public Sector&#13;
2.12  The Ministries. The Ministry of Transport and Public Works (MTPT)&#13;
continues to dominate the sector through its responsibility for (a) overall management&#13;
of transport and public works sectors, including sector and subsector strategy and&#13;
subsector coordination; and (b) road investment programming and implementation and&#13;
maintenance of the national and rural road networks, including the primary urban road&#13;
network. Responsibility for other urban roads is held by the municipalities in the main&#13;
cities (Cotonou, Porto-Novo, Parakou), and in the smaller cities and towns by the&#13;
Ministry of Environment, Urban Development and Housing (MEHU). MTPT&#13;
coordinates its rural road operations with those included in donor-financed rural&#13;
development projects, under the Ministry of Rural Development (MDR), through a&#13;
National Technical Council for Rural Roads (CTN), which began regular meetings in&#13;
early 1995. Autonomous port and rail entities have taken over investment programming&#13;
and implementation and infrastructure maintenance from MTPT. Airport management&#13;
will also be subcontracted to an autonomous agency which is currently being created.&#13;
The Ministries of Planning and Finance are also involved in the Public Investment&#13;
Program (PIP) and in providing counterpart funds and Road Fund subsidies.&#13;
2.13  Railway and Port Operators. The railway company (OCBN) is jointly owned&#13;
by the governments of Benin and Niger and the maritime navigation company&#13;
(COBENAM) by the governments of Benin and Algeria. Privatization of OCBN would&#13;
likely be problematic, since rail operations are barely profitable due to fierce&#13;
competitive pressure from road transport. The port authority (PAC), under Government&#13;
ownership, is directly responsible only for coordination of port operations and contracts&#13;
out other activities such as maintenance and security. COBENAM, the public shipping&#13;
company, continues to exist despite the fact that it owns no ships. All other port&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8 -&#13;
operations (transit, consignment) are fully privatized. State-owned SOBEMAP holds a&#13;
monopoly on cargo handling in the port; another parastatal (CNCB) coordinates&#13;
national shippers and supports them through training and assistance. SOBEMAP is&#13;
being supported by French bilateral aid (CFD) which has financed its restructuring. At&#13;
current levels of port traffic, full privatization at this time could lead to control of all&#13;
cargo handling in the hands of a single private company. This would introduce&#13;
vulnerability into one of the most rapidly growing areas of Benin's economy.&#13;
Therefore, Government is considering only progressive privatization, starting with&#13;
container handling operations.&#13;
2.14 MTPT's Directorates. New management brought into MTPT in 1991&#13;
immediately began to design and carry out a very effective, internally driven&#13;
reorganization which has corrected structural flaws and turned it into a sound&#13;
organization. Where before a single central unit (Direction des etudes et des&#13;
programmes) had de facto authority for both programming and execution, these&#13;
functions were separated in February 1992 between a programming unit (Cellule de&#13;
programmation et de coordination or CPC), and the roads and bridges department&#13;
(DROA) for the road subsector. Each has since demonstrated its efficiency, CPC by&#13;
managing preparation of the transport sector strategy, and DROA by reducing road&#13;
maintenance costs by 80 percent and keeping both paved and unpaved priority networks&#13;
open for the last several years (half of the unpaved network had become impassable in&#13;
the rainy season during the 1980s). Other structural changes brought the previously&#13;
illsupervised regional maintenance units under DROA's authority, began contracting&#13;
out maintenance works to the private sector, reduced force account teams, and made the&#13;
former equipment section into a separate department (DMTP) requiring chargeback to&#13;
DROA of equipment rental costs. Further improvements in field data collection,&#13;
maintenance of bridges and culverts, redeployment and training of staff, and&#13;
streamlining of contractor payment processing, recently proposed by DROA, would&#13;
make DROA one of the most effective road transport agencies in the region.&#13;
2.15  Road Maintenance Financing and Execution Entities. The Road Fund&#13;
finances road maintenance activities executed or supervised by DROA. It was created&#13;
in 1984 as an independent public body to finance only road maintenance, with a board&#13;
which includes user representatives. In fact, the Road Fund has not been independent:&#13;
subsequent decrees allowed MTPT to directly manage the Road Fund, and the Minister&#13;
has been the chairman of the board. As a result, the Road Fund has financed not only&#13;
road maintenance but also road investments and certain MTPT operating costs,&#13;
including the salaries of DROA staff involved in road maintenance and other tasks.&#13;
DROA carries out its authority for the maintenance of the whole network (interstate,&#13;
national and rural) through its six regional services (SROA), under the supervision of its&#13;
road maintenance office (Sous-Direction de l'entretien routier or S/RER). SROAs are&#13;
in charge of preparing maintenance programns, executing or contracting out minor&#13;
rehabilitation works and periodic and routine maintenance operations, and monitoring&#13;
maintenance works undertaken under contract and by force account. DROA's road&#13;
management office (Bureau de gestion du reseau or BGR) is responsible for collecting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
and processing the network status and traffic data, which are the basis for the&#13;
preparation of investment and maintenance programs.&#13;
2.16  Municipality of Cotonou. While Cotonou's primary road network is part of&#13;
MTPT's national network, the rest of the urban network is the responsibility of the&#13;
municipality of Cotonou (Circonscription urbaine or CU), which comes under the&#13;
authority of the Interior Ministry. To manage this network, Cotonou CU has recently&#13;
created technical units (Cellules techniques de la circonscription urbaine or CTCU),&#13;
which to date have limited authority. A Cotonou traffic management unit was created at&#13;
the end of 1995 within the Cotonou CTU. Cotonou CU also draws on the services of a&#13;
regional urban development studies bureau (SERHAU-SEM) and of an urban works&#13;
agency (AGETUR). SERHAU was created in 1985 as a public-private venture which&#13;
participates, under contract, in the implementation of the ongoing Urban Rehabilitation&#13;
and Management Project (Credit BEN-2338). AGETUR was created in 1990 as a non-&#13;
profit association which manages contracts with private firmns to carry out civil works,&#13;
including the preparation of bidding documents, call for bids, evaluation of bids and&#13;
contract award, monitoring of payments and works supervision.&#13;
2.17  National Road Safety Center. The National Road Safety Center (CNSR) was&#13;
established in 1988 with IDA assistance under the Third Highway Project, in response&#13;
to high road accident rates in Benin, as a permanent institution devoted to the design&#13;
and implementation of a road safety policy for Government. Its US$1.2 million annual&#13;
operating costs are divided about equally between civil service payroll and Government&#13;
direct subsidies on the one hand, and CNSR revenues from vehicle inspection centers&#13;
on the other. The CNSR enjoys considerable respect in West Africa, and its work is&#13;
being observed by similar organizations in neighboring countries, with regional&#13;
interaction, centered on CNSR, now in the making. It has focused on two main tasks:&#13;
(a) systematic analysis of accident statistics available from 1988 to the present; and (b) a&#13;
road safety program involving vehicle inspection, driver instruction, media information,&#13;
and random roadside checks. The CNSR is a well-run operation and has succeeded in&#13;
inspecting annually 35,000 of the 45,000 vehicles on the road, with only one full-time&#13;
inspection station in Cotonou and part-time inspections in Parakou and Bohicon. As a&#13;
result, accident rates appear to be leveling off, in spite of a rapid increase in&#13;
motorization and a vehicle fleet, more than 90 percent of which is more than 10 years&#13;
old.&#13;
Private Sector&#13;
2.18  Since 1984, transport sector liberalization has seen the withdrawal of public&#13;
entities from production activities, including road maintenance, road freight transport&#13;
and passenger transport. Most road rehabilitation, and periodic and routine maintenance&#13;
works, are already subcontracted to private operators, and road toll collections are being&#13;
subcontracted. MTPT intends to cap the level of force account maintenance at the&#13;
current level of about CFA franc I billion a year and contract out all planned increases&#13;
in road maintenance activities, reaching about CFA franc 3 billion by 1998.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
2.19  Informal Transport Operators. Most transport operations are carried out by&#13;
the informal sector. The exceptions are private companies. either owned by foreign&#13;
partners (new car dealers), or close to the fonnal sector (freight transport for the railway&#13;
and for the cotton company). but the rest of freight transport is mainly informal. Port&#13;
operations such as transit and consignment are officially carried out by formal sector&#13;
companies, but in fact are subcontracted in part to informal operators. Urban and&#13;
interurban passenger transport is fully infornal, although operators have been registered&#13;
by the municipalities since 1992. Finally, the used car market is almost completely&#13;
informal. The flexibility and quick supply response characteristic of the informal sector&#13;
give the Beninese economy, in particular its transport sector, a major comparative&#13;
advantage over those of its neighbors.&#13;
2.20  Local Civil Works Industry. The civil works private sector has grown&#13;
dramatically since 1990. This growth has been fueled by the establishment of two&#13;
contracting agencies, AGETUR and the Agency for Management of the Social&#13;
Dimension of Adjustment (AGDSD), the availability of funds for the rehabilitation of&#13;
Cotonou's municipal network, and the privatization of a portion of MTPT's unpaved&#13;
road rehabilitation works. Some 800 contractors (construction and public works) have&#13;
been identified in Cotonou and Porto Novo. Many of these belong to the informal&#13;
sector. Some 38 firms constitute the most formal part of the sector and have&#13;
demonstrated their willingness and capacity to meet public works demand.&#13;
Privatization of road maintenance on MTPT networks began in 1988. Since 1991,&#13;
around 50 percent of the minor rehabilitation operations (drainage structure repairs and&#13;
spot rehabilitation) have been executed under contract. Privatization of routine&#13;
maintenance was started in 1991 and by 1993 had expanded to cover 40 percent of&#13;
manual maintenance operations and 14 percent of routine maintenance expenses. A&#13;
contract for a pilot mechanized routine maintenance operation was awarded in 1993,&#13;
and by 1998, 75 percent of road maintenance works will be contracted out.&#13;
2.21   Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). Prior to 1991, only religious&#13;
organizations, mostly foreign, were active in both urban and rural areas. The&#13;
democratic revival of 1989 resulted in the establishment of hundreds of local NGOs,&#13;
and with the encouragement now being given to private initiatives, the numbers&#13;
continue to grow. NGOs are involved in natural resources management, provision of&#13;
basic health care, training and education, and support to income-generating activities. A&#13;
number of NGOs focus primarily on rural women. providing training in nutrition and&#13;
health education through participatory techniques developed by the West Africa Center&#13;
of Social and Economic Studies in Burkina Faso. and by the Research Group for&#13;
Support of Rural Self Promotion. At least four international NGOs are very active in&#13;
Benin in the areas of rural roads, SME promotion, and construction of rural&#13;
infrastructure such as wells and small earth dams.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
C. LESSONS LEARNED FROM BANK GROUP AND OTHER&#13;
DONORS' INVOLVEMENT IN THE TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
Donor Involvement&#13;
2.22  The European Development Fund (FED) and IDA are the two most active&#13;
donors in the transport sector. FED has financed mainly road paving and rural roads, as&#13;
have the African Development Bank (BAD), the West Africa Development Bank&#13;
(BOAD) and German bilateral aid (KfW). French bilateral aid (CFD) has financed&#13;
infrastructure and equipment rehabilitation for the port, the railroad and Cotonou airport&#13;
and also rural roads. Other donors (Islamic Development Bank or BID, Community of&#13;
West African States or CDEAO. and Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or&#13;
OPEP) finance smaller amounts of specitic road paving works. Prior to the preparation&#13;
of the 1994 transport sector strategy, the lack of a single unifying strategy led to&#13;
conflicting initiatives by different donors.&#13;
Past IDA Involvement&#13;
2.23   Since 1970, IDA has supported nine projects in Beninl's transport sector. These&#13;
have had a major impact on the road network and port capacity: virtually the entire&#13;
priority road network has benefited directly from works financed by IDA (see Map&#13;
IBRD 27427), and most major works in the port since its opening in 1965, in particular&#13;
the doubling of its capacity in the early 1980s, have been financed by IDA. These&#13;
transport projects have also supported major sectoral reforms, including establishment&#13;
of a Road Fund, a major financial and staff restructuring by the port authority, and&#13;
preparation of transport sector strategies in 1984 and in 1994. During the recent&#13;
Transport Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (Cr. 1807-BEN), under&#13;
the leadership of a small group of local technical managers, road investment and road&#13;
maintenance improved markedly: the unpaved road network has remained free of&#13;
serious cuts even during rainy seasons.&#13;
Lessons Learned&#13;
2.24  There are four main conclusions drawsn from these IDA-supported projects: (a)&#13;
Road Fund dependence on budget allocations or earmarked fuel taxes has not generated&#13;
sufficient resources to ensure maintenance of infrastructure; what is needed is direct&#13;
funding by user charges (extension of road tolls, which have proven successful); (b) the&#13;
lack of coordination among donors and among transport entities has been a major&#13;
obstacle to the sustainability of reforms; what is needed is agreement to follow a single&#13;
sector strategy; (c) Government's effectiveness in transport programs has varied directly&#13;
as a function of the continuity of leadership, within the Ministry; what is needed is a&#13;
continuation of leadership. avoiding the high staff turnover.&#13;
2.25   The fourth lesson relates to the need for more mechanisms for participation by&#13;
users and operators. The 1992-94 preparation of the sector strategy benefited greatly&#13;
from a new consultation process, adopted in the wake of democratization beginning in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
1989. There remain a few key areas where adoption of this process would yield broad&#13;
benefits. In the port, special interests stand in the way of greater user and operator&#13;
involvement in decision-making: the monopoly of the cargo handling authority,&#13;
SOBEMAP, and the privileges of customs officers. Decisions about road maintenance&#13;
priorities continue to be dominated by internal administrative considerations, rather than&#13;
by road users. Meeting users' and operators' needs is critical to improving transport&#13;
facilitation and lowering transport costs in the future.&#13;
D. TRANSPORT SECTOR ISSUES AND STRATEGY&#13;
The 1994 Transport Sector Strategy Report&#13;
2.26   Preparation. Studies carried out in 1992 by MTPT, completed in April 1993,&#13;
have formed the basis for the Transport Sector Strategy. focusing on facilitation,&#13;
fiscal/financial and capacity building. Broad consultation of public and private&#13;
stakeholders was sought through a number of seminars, allowing a broad exchange of&#13;
views, and developing a national sector policy. Govenument presented its transport&#13;
sector strategy to donors at a Round Table meeting in October 1993. Comprehensive&#13;
discussions of this strategy continued during Bank visits in December 1993, and in&#13;
March 1994 a Transport Sector Strategy Report. prepared jointly by MTPT and the&#13;
World Bank. was issued (Transport Sector Strategy Report No. 12098-BEN, March 15,&#13;
1994). This transport strategy, summarized briefly below, was subsequently&#13;
incorporated into IDA's country assistance strategy. and has continued to generate&#13;
substantial momentum for change in Benin. Policy changes and other measures put into&#13;
effect since the strategy's publication are covered below. Government's February 1996&#13;
Strategy Letter (ANNEX A), and detailed action plans (see ANNEX B), reflect both&#13;
these recent developments and also the next steps which Government is planning to take&#13;
in support of the sector strategy.&#13;
2.27  Findings. The Strategy report defines strategies for the sector as a whole and&#13;
for each of the five subsectors (road, road transport, port and maritime, rail and air).&#13;
The main findings are that Benin's transport infrastructure is well adapted to demand,&#13;
and major improvements have been achieved under the recently completed Transport&#13;
Rehabilitation Transport Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (Cr.&#13;
1807-BEN). Since 1984, liberalization and privatization of transport activities have&#13;
resolved many of the issues raised in the first sector strategy report (1984), and&#13;
leadership within DROA has led to improvement in road conditions, especially on&#13;
unpaved roads. Physically. institutionally. and financially. Benin is close to being able&#13;
to manage its road system. independent of external assistance. Problems in road&#13;
transport management, which weaken Benin's ability to compete against other corridors&#13;
and to support growth in the agricultural sector, can be resolved within the framework&#13;
of the strategy. Specific actions are recommended. A five-year programming approach&#13;
is recommended to create a strong foundation for transport maintenance and investment&#13;
for the remainder of the decade.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
Road Maintenance.&#13;
2.28  The main issues are (a) continued vulnerability of even improved and&#13;
maintained unpaved and paved roads; (b) continued shortfalls of about CFA franc 2.5&#13;
billion per year in funding of road maintenance through the Road Fund; and (c) specific&#13;
technical weaknesses within the Ministry in traffic data collection, works programming&#13;
and contract management. Since 1992, road maintenance operations have dramatically&#13;
improved and the major issue now by far is the shortage of funds. Until 1994, the Road&#13;
Fund's main income source was a share of fuel tax revenues. Due to the collapse of the&#13;
economy in the late 1980s and the unauthorized and tax-free importation from Nigeria&#13;
of around 80 percent of all fuel consumed in Benin during 1991-94, fuel tax income has&#13;
contributed an average of only 23 percent of Road Fund resources. In addition, because&#13;
the Road Fund lacks real autonomy and MTPT continually interferes in its&#13;
management, only 60 percent of total resources are used for road maintenance.&#13;
2.29  Road Fund Restructuring. The statutes of the Road Fund (see Para. 2.15) are&#13;
being revised to give it greater autonomy from MTPT and to guarantee the use of its&#13;
resources for road maintenance. The new statutes will: (i) increase the power of the&#13;
board, which includes road user representatives, by giving it authority to nominate its&#13;
chairman and select its managers; and (ii) limit Road Fund interventions to financing&#13;
the maintenance of MTPT-managed road networks and of expenses directly related to&#13;
the management of road maintenance, giving priority to routine maintenance. The Road&#13;
Fund will no longer finance payroll costs and other operating costs for road&#13;
maintenance activities, but only the costs of works under performance-based contracts,&#13;
whether executed by force account units or private enterprises. Revised Road Fund&#13;
statutes satisfactory to IDA have been finalized as a condition of negotiations (Decree&#13;
No. 96-373 of August 29, 1996). Its new management tools will be installed as stated&#13;
in a supplemental letter agreed upon at negotiations (see ANNEX B).&#13;
2.30  Road Maintenance Financing. An essentially self-financing plan has been&#13;
worked out based on the increase in Road Fund resources and on the reduction of road&#13;
maintenance costs. Road Fund resources will be increased to ensure adequate financing&#13;
for all routine road maintenance, and progressively for periodic maintenance as well.&#13;
Three major steps in this direction were taken in 1995: the road tax collected at the port&#13;
site was increased from 0.15 percent to 0.85 percent of merchandise value,&#13;
Government's contribution to the Road Fund was increased from CFA franc 400&#13;
million to CFA franc 600 million. and road toll collection was turned over to private&#13;
firms. As a result. the Road Fund collected around CFA franc 2.1 billion in 1995&#13;
compared to an average of CFA 1I.1 billion annually from 1989 to 1994. Additional&#13;
resources will come from the extension of the road toll system to the entire paved&#13;
network, expected to increase toll collections from the current CFA franc 200 million&#13;
(US$0.7 million) annually to about CFA franc 1.5 billion (US$5.5 million) a year.&#13;
These new revenues will be adequate to finance 100 percent and 30 percent of routine&#13;
and periodic maintenance respectively, starting in 1997. The gap for periodic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14-&#13;
maintenance will continue to be financed by the national investment budget until the&#13;
Road Fund is able to finance it.&#13;
2.31   The Road Fund will reduce its payroll costs, as defined in the January 1996&#13;
strategy letter, by encouraging early staff retirement and entering into single-man&#13;
contractor agreements with the remaining maintenance laborers (about 350).&#13;
Implementation of an early staff retirement plan started before negotiations of the&#13;
proposed IDA credit. Completion of staff restructuring will be a condition of&#13;
effectiveness of the proposed IDA credit. The Road Fund's financial situation would&#13;
also be strengthened by accepting a lower service level, by transferring part of the cost&#13;
of maintenance on non-priority rural roads (less than 50 veh/day) to local users, and by&#13;
transferring urban road maintenance to municipalities.&#13;
2.32   Road Maintenance Execution and Programming. In order to guarantee the&#13;
optimal use of Road Fund financing, MTPT will implement measures to improve road&#13;
maintenance performance. MTPT will optimize the deployment of existing staff and&#13;
reinforce skill levels, in order to meet requirements and to allow for adaptation to the&#13;
progressive privatization of road maintenance operations. The top priorities will be&#13;
given to staff management, user cost recovery, data collection, procurement, and bridge&#13;
and drainage structure management within DROA. In its February 1996 policy letter&#13;
(see Annex A), Government decided to: (a) limit the extent of force account activities to&#13;
a fixed CFA franc I billion per year, with the balance of an increasing road maintenance&#13;
budget being contracted out to private companies; (b) disengage itself progressively&#13;
from heavy equipment management; (c) promote development of private sector capacity&#13;
to carry out public works by facilitating private enterprises' access to public contracts,&#13;
and by establishing a self-supporting technical advisory office for SMEs; (d) delegate&#13;
authority to sign maintenance contracts up to US$1 million equivalent to MTPT; and (e)&#13;
increase involvement of users in road maintenance planning and rural road maintenance&#13;
and planning and transfer part of its financing to local communities. The reorganization&#13;
of DROA will be completed as defined in a supplemental letter agreed upon at&#13;
negotiation (see ANNEX B).&#13;
2.33   Road Transport. Road transit traffic toward neighboring countries is hindered&#13;
by cumbersome regulations; more than 20 checkpoints on the road from Cotonou to the&#13;
Niger border add an estimated 20 to 30 percent, or CFA franc 2 billion per year, to&#13;
transport costs on this route. To facilitate road transport, Government intends to (a)&#13;
improve facilitation of road transport and increase operator competence; (b) improve&#13;
road safety and service quality by improved ftnctioning of the used vehicles market,&#13;
including vehicle inspection; (c) improve performance of urban mototaxis by&#13;
establishing traffic management and modifying roads; and (d) encourage transport&#13;
operators to move progressively from the informal sector to the formal sector through a&#13;
better professional environment. Organizational and regulatory aspects would be&#13;
addressed by developing mechanisms for transport users in Cotonou to bring pressure to&#13;
bear, improving existing regulations and statistics supporting road safety agencies and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
road transport associations, and reviewing regulation of commercial trade movements in&#13;
close coordination with Niger.&#13;
Port Operations and Maritime Issues&#13;
2.34  The port of Cotonou compares very poorly with its competitors in terms of&#13;
transport facilitation and operational productivity. Freight handling productivity is half&#13;
of that in Dakar and transit time for a container through the port is around ten days,&#13;
more than twice the average time in other regional ports. The main reasons are slow&#13;
administrative procedures; poor performance, in particular of the customs office; lack of&#13;
accountability regarding the overall port performance; and congestion due to the high&#13;
volume of used vehicle imports passing through the port area. Despite major cost-&#13;
cutting reforms and years of technical assistance in finance and accounting, the port&#13;
authority, PAC, remains in poor financial health. In response to these issues,&#13;
Government measures included in the Transport Sector Strategy were to (a) restrict new&#13;
port investment to the minimum necessary to handle basic traffic levels and introduce&#13;
cost accounting at PAC; (b) restrict the port area for port activities; (c) improve&#13;
SOBEMAP operations and subcontract cargo handling in the port when SOBEMAP&#13;
fails to perform and when sudden traffic increases create port congestion; (d) collect&#13;
data on the efficiency of port operators and administrative bodies, identify the&#13;
bottlenecks, and implement and monitor the necessary changes to reduce delays; (e)&#13;
clarify responsibilities along the transport chain; and (f) review COBENAM and CNCB&#13;
roles and activities in light of regional developments. Since the strategy report, the&#13;
following initiatives have been undertaken in the area of Port operations management&#13;
and coordination, and PAC's financial situation.&#13;
2.35  Port Coordination. In its February 1996 strategy letter, Government&#13;
announced its decision to give priority to improve overall port performance, in&#13;
preference to the earlier approach of focusing on individual operators, by strengthening&#13;
the power of the port authority (PAC). PAC's statutes will be strengthened to give it the&#13;
authority to enforce coordination and supervision of port operations, including specific&#13;
authority over port operators' technical performance in accordance with the decrees&#13;
signed on May 31, 1996. PAC's new statutes were finalized before negotiations of the&#13;
proposed IDA credit and will not be modified without IDA's agreement. Under these&#13;
statutes, PAC will be held accountable for specific measures listed in Government's&#13;
strategy letter, including transfer of container customs inspection to an area outside the&#13;
main port compound, along with storage and sale of used vehicles. All public actors&#13;
(SOBEMAP, Customs, COBENAM and CNCB) would be linked by the port operation&#13;
management software (Portware) used by PAC so as to increase the operational&#13;
transparency and allow PAC to actually monitor their performance. A step towards&#13;
dissolving SOBEMAP's monopoly would be taken, by assigning operations of the&#13;
container handling to a private company.&#13;
2.36  PAC's Financial Situation. To allow PAC to play its new role, its financial&#13;
situation will be strengthened. PAC has adopted a stricter policy towards non-paying&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16-&#13;
clients, prepared a plan to further improve its accounting systems, including staff&#13;
retraining, and decided to commission an update of the port development plan. PAC&#13;
will also continue to work towards a sound and sustainable financial situation. To this&#13;
end and subject to annual updating discussed as part of the updating of the sector&#13;
investment program, PAC has set the following specific targets: (a) to freeze payroll&#13;
expenditures at current levels until the year 2000; (b) to set aside around CFA franc 420&#13;
million to finance routine and periodic maintenance; (c) to limit external borrowing to&#13;
CFA franc 3 billion over the next six years; and (d) to limit investment expenditures&#13;
over the next six years to the strict minimum required for agreed improvements in&#13;
operational performance.&#13;
Rail and Air Sector Issues&#13;
2.37  The rail company, OCBN is not competitive, and airport infrastructure is close&#13;
to failure. Government signed a "contract-plan" with OCBN in 1994 which includes&#13;
measures to improve OCBN's management performance and should enhance its&#13;
competitiveness. Under its "contract-plan" with the Government, OCBN has been&#13;
given productivity targets and provision has been made that OCBN will receive no&#13;
subsidy nor any guarantee for loans. Performance in meeting "contract-plan" provisions&#13;
will be reviewed with IDA every year. This makes OCBN financially independent and&#13;
creates a real incentive for performance improvement. The French CFD is supporting&#13;
OCBN and finances its investment program, together with technical support. In the air&#13;
subsector, Government is establishing an autonomous entity which will start managing&#13;
airport operations with the support of French bilateral aid (CFD) beginning in June&#13;
1996. The Cotonou airport should generate enough revenues to cover operating and&#13;
maintenance expenses for the whole sector, including the domestic airports, and to&#13;
ensure debt service for the financing of the upgrading program.&#13;

3. FIVE-YEAR TRANSPORT SECTOR PROGRAM&#13;
A. PROGRAM CONCEPT AND OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.1   The Government's 1996-2000 Transport Sector Priority Investment Program&#13;
reflects the priorities agreed in the recent Transport Sector Strategy and confirmed in&#13;
Government's Strategy Letter (see ANNEX A). Strategy objectives relate directly to&#13;
country issues of competitiveness, administrative capacity, resource mobilization, and&#13;
private sector participation. They are (a) to safeguard the competitiveness of Benin's&#13;
transport sector and of its transit corridor through open modal competition; (b) to improve&#13;
Government's capacity for planning, programming, and managing transport sector&#13;
investments; (c) to boost the allocation of resources to infrastructure maintenance; (d) to&#13;
boost the recovery of infrastructure user charges; (e) to expand private sector participation&#13;
in public works and maximize its impact on the creation of jobs for unskilled labor; (f) to&#13;
build capacity in sector institutions and optimize human resource utilization; and (f) to&#13;
protect the environment and improve road safety conditions.&#13;
3.2   The proposed program is the first to be conceived in the context of a sector&#13;
strategy, based on a full review of the evidence and open debate by participants. Port&#13;
operations and facilitation will be improved by networking PAC with all port and customs&#13;
agencies so that PAC can fully deploy existing computer-based management tools.&#13;
Selection of critical priority unpaved road works to be financed under the program has&#13;
been based on minimum service levels required at specific traffic volumes, using a&#13;
methodology developed by DROA during the recently completed Transport Infrastructure&#13;
Rehabilitation Project, which optimizes the use of available resources. The program&#13;
supports the extension of generalized road user tolls proven in Benin as the most reliable&#13;
means of road infrastructure cost recovery, given the constraints on the alternative means&#13;
of fuel taxation. The program design also supports Government objectives (a) to increase&#13;
user participation in road maintenance finance and management, as in the case of rural&#13;
road maintenance; and (b) to facilitate private sector construction industry in maintenance&#13;
works contracting, in particular for small urban improvements. The program would also&#13;
introduce one small new entity, an urban traffic management unit, under the responsibility&#13;
of the city of Cotonou. Issues identified during the design phase, Government's response&#13;
to date, and specific measures Government plans to implement over the next few years are&#13;
summarized in action plan form in ANNEX B.&#13;
B. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.3   Management of transport sector investment by means of a rolling five-year priority&#13;
investment program is a key element of Government's transport strategy. Such a program&#13;
was first drafted as part of the sector strategy preparation, and was updated and reviewed&#13;
with other donors at appraisal of the proposed program. The composition of the priority&#13;
program and its phasing are shown in Table 3.1. The program, which includes all&#13;
ongoing operations, will be updated each year by adjusting total sector investment to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18-&#13;
current macroeconomic conditions and adding new works only when they are justified. It&#13;
will be broken down into successive phases of execution, defined in agreement with the&#13;
involved donors during annual meetings. Total program cost amounts to CFA franc 247&#13;
billion (US$494 million) over the 1996-2000 period, or roughly a third of estimated gross&#13;
fixed capital formation over the same period (CFA franc 680 billion), which is consistent&#13;
with the transport sector's past and expected future share of fixed capital formation and&#13;
public investment. The peak shown for 1996-1998 is due to the expense for the upgrading&#13;
of Cotonou-Porto Novo Road. Transport represents one third of public investment and&#13;
continues to be the highest of any sector (compared to about 20 percent each for rural&#13;
development and social services).&#13;

3.4    About 90 percent of the five-year priority program cost consists of road paving&#13;
and repair and periodic road maintenance, required to bring the paved and unpaved&#13;
networks up to a fair or good standard. Periodic road maintenance is the top priority in the&#13;
program. Government would continue to finance investment and maintenance of the&#13;
priority rural network at expenditure levels justified from an economic viewpoint,&#13;
normally when traffic exceeds 50 veh/day.&#13;
3.5   The new investments included in the program are intended strictly to upgrade&#13;
existing infrastructure and strengthen institutions and procedures required to improve&#13;
productivity. In particular, no expansion is foreseen in port berthing capacity until after&#13;
the year 2000. No provision is made in the government investment program for rail&#13;
investment (OCBN) which will no longer be receiving public funds or investment&#13;
guarantees under the provisions of the "contrat-plan" signed between the Benin and Niger&#13;
governments and OCBN. The program does include the paving of 318 km of gravel roads&#13;
(of which 218 now underway), amounting to 9 percent of the program. Paving of a 60 km&#13;
road section providing the main link into the Burkina Faso road system (Natitingou-&#13;
Porga), and of another 200 km linking this section to the coastal region which provides&#13;
alternate paved routings to the existing main north-south road (Savalou-Djougou-Ouake),&#13;
have been included in the program at Government request, despite these investments' low&#13;
economic justification (ERR below 12 percent). They have been phased at the end of the&#13;
period and only about a fifth of their actual estimated cost has been included (CFA franc&#13;
7.8 million versus 44 million). Considered as a last priority, their ultimate inclusion in the&#13;
PIP is subject to discussion following implementation of higher priority works.&#13;
&#13;

C. PROGRAM FINANCING&#13;
3.6      Following discussions at appraisal with Government and external donors,&#13;
financing has been secured for CFA franc 156 billion of the CFA franc 246 billion in the&#13;
current program, including about CFA franc 20 billion equivalent from the proposed IDA&#13;
Credit, and local counterpart fumds for all five years (CFA franc 16 billion). Financing&#13;
agreed at the date of this report, for both ongoing operations and those about to start is&#13;
shown in Table 3.2. French bilateral aid (CFD) will finance around CFA franc 9 billion&#13;
for improvements in the port (cargo handling equipment replacement, technical assistance)&#13;
and airport (runway rehabilitation). Financing of CFA franc 11 billion of road&#13;
construction and rehabilitation already underway or about to begin on the paved network&#13;
has already been obtained from BID, the Kuwait Fund, BOAD, OPEP, CDEAO, BAD,&#13;
DANIDA, KfW, and FED.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
billion remain to be found. Completion of these negotiations would ensure financing for&#13;
the rest of the paved road rehabilitation (BAD's CFA franc 3 billion for Pob&amp;Ketou), and&#13;
the continuation of works on access and through roads in Cotonou city (FED and BAD's&#13;
CFA franc 25 billion for Godomey-Akossombo, and KfW funds for Sobebra Old Bridge).&#13;
The remaining financing gap would involve mostly paved roads (CFA franc 33 billion),&#13;
paved road periodic maintenance (CFA franc 12 billion), and completion of drainage&#13;
repairs and periodic maintenance on unpaved roads (CFA franc 5.9 billion). The FED,&#13;
which has been the main donor in these areas, has indicated its interest in financing the&#13;
paved road works, but its participation cannot be confirmed until the Lome VIII program&#13;
is finalized by the end of 1996. BAD and BOAD have expressed interest in the unpaved&#13;
road works, either for the last three or first two years of the program. If this money is&#13;
available for the first two years, IDA funds could be reallocated for third-year&#13;
expenditures, and more IDA funds could be reallocated to later years in case KfW comes&#13;
through with financing in drainage repairs, for which it has indicated interest.&#13;
3.8   Total Beninese funding would amount to about CFA franc 16 billion over the five-&#13;
year period, of which about CFA franc 3 billion would be provided through the budgets of&#13;
PAC and the Road Fund. Therefore, about CFA franc 2.5 billion a year would need to be&#13;
included in the Government's investment budget to cover remaining counterpart fund&#13;
requirements, about equal to the amount made available in 1995.&#13;
D. PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
3.9   Government has agreed to include in its Public Investment Program (PIP) and&#13;
undertake only those transport sector works included in the five-year priority program.&#13;
The program may include only those investments with ERR greater than 12 percent for&#13;
new works, and works on unpaved roads whose economic justification has been&#13;
demonstrated according to the methodology agreed at appraisal and specified in the&#13;
Project Implementation Manual (details in ANNEX C). Priority will be given to periodic&#13;
maintenance works in preference to new works: should periodic maintenance not be fully&#13;
executed under a specific year, the backlog will be the top priority in the program of the&#13;
following year, and no new road improvement or upgrading works will be proposed under&#13;
the rolling program or the PIP unless adequate funding for routine and periodic road&#13;
maintenance has been demonstrated for the previous year. The five-year priority&#13;
program will be updated on an annual basis and reviewed with IDA prior to&#13;
December 31 of the preceding year. Definition of annual slices shall include all works&#13;
from earlier slices which have not been executed. Beginning in 1997, the five-year&#13;
program will include safety improvement works for paved roads as defined by CNSR and&#13;
traffic improvement works on the MTPT network in Cotonou as prepared by the new&#13;
traffic management unit.&#13;
3.10  Coordination of the priority program will be carried out by a committee including&#13;
MTPT and the Ministries of Planning and Finance (MP and MF), under MTPT&#13;
chairmanship. The committee will be responsible for (a) formulating priority investment&#13;
and maintenance programs of all subsectors, in accordance with proposals from the&#13;
entities in charge of each subsector; (b) defining yearly slices defined according to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
availability of counterpart funds and road maintenance financing capacity; and (c) donor&#13;
coordination. MP's involvement will ensure that the program is agreed upon by all&#13;
entities involved in the road sector and that the size of the slices matches the PIP&#13;
provisions. MTPT's Programming and Coordination Unit (CPC) will act as the&#13;
committee's secretariat and will execute the administrative work of the committee,&#13;
including donor meeting scheduling, preparation and organization. The definition of the&#13;
committee's functions and its operating procedures are included in the Implementation&#13;
Manual agreed upon at negotiations.&#13;
3.11   Every two years, Government will organize a donor round table to discuss&#13;
program financing and define annual priority program slices. The first and second round&#13;
table meeting will be held prior to November 30, 1996. and between January 1 and March&#13;
30, 1998. During this round table, Government will provide donors with a comprehensive&#13;
report showing: (a) actual execution status of the investment program; (b) performance&#13;
indicators for each subsector; and (c) actual progress in the implementation of policy and&#13;
institutional measures.&#13;
E. COMPONENTS SUPPORTED BY IDA CREDIT&#13;
Component Selection&#13;
3.12  In light of the objectives of Government's overall adjustment strategy, as&#13;
supported by SAL III in the context of the CAS, the choice of priority transport&#13;
investments for IDA funding under the proposed program has focused on infrastructure&#13;
maintenance and rehabilitation, supporting rural production, encouraging private sector&#13;
supply response, mobilizing domestic resources through user charges, and building&#13;
institutional capacity. The choices also reflect IDA's comparative advantage in the roads&#13;
and port subsectors, and IDA's ongoing involvement in the urban sector.&#13;
3.13  IDA funds will be used only for private contracting operations and not for force&#13;
account maintenance in the proposed road component, while also supporting&#13;
improvements in overall maintenance planning. No routine maintenance would be&#13;
financed by the Credit, since Government will finance all routine maintenance through the&#13;
Road Fund. Previous difficulties with community participation in rural road works have&#13;
led to the design of a pilot in the proposed program which is demand-driven. The only&#13;
rehabilitation works are those required to bring the most important unpaved road sections&#13;
in the network up to a maintainable standard and provide for their initial regravelling. The&#13;
only paved road works financed by the Credit, which are required for traffic&#13;
improvements in Cotonou and for elimination of high accident locations on the paved&#13;
interurban network, are to be executed in line with institutional changes supported by the&#13;
ongoing Urban Rehabilitation and Management Project (Cr. 2338-BEN). Two design&#13;
changes running through all components involve (a) the switch from permanent to short-&#13;
term technical assistance; continuity is maintained by retaining proven TA staff, and (b)&#13;
revival or introduction of mechanisms for user participation in decision-making.&#13;
3.14  IDA funds would support primarily: (a) component A: port improvements, in an&#13;
amount of about CFA franc 2.6 billion out of a total of CFA franc 12 billion needed; (b)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
component B: rehabilitation and regravelling of the most important unpaved road sections&#13;
in the network, and spot works critical to road safety on the paved network (CFA franc 9.3&#13;
billion); (c) component C: a pilot community-based feeder roads maintenance program in&#13;
the amount of CFA franc 1.4 billion; and (d) component D: support for traffic&#13;
improvement works in Cotonou (CFA franc 2.1 billion). IDA's funds under this credit&#13;
will be used as last resort financing for the highest priority expenditures. Additional funds&#13;
for the overall unpaved road works and maintenance program are to be provided by&#13;
BOAD (CFA franc 0.5 billion) and the Govenmment of Benin (Road Fund and PIP, CFA&#13;
franc 3.3 billion), leaving a financing gap of CFA franc 5.9 billion for unpaved roads.&#13;
About CFA franc 15.5 billion for feeder roads will come from KfW, BOAD, BID, FED,&#13;
CFD (CFA franc 10.2 billion), along with IDA's Credit. Institutional strengthening in the&#13;
various subsectors is included in the technical assistance and training elements of&#13;
investment projects funded by BAD, FED. CFD and ACDI. and IDA will finance around&#13;
CFA franc 4 billion for institutional strengthening in the road subsector. Should other&#13;
donors decide to finance works currently included in the proposed IDA components, IDA&#13;
may finance other works in the five-year program in priority order.&#13;
3.15  The proposed Credit will finance works, goods and services in the program for the&#13;
four components described below. Component content is summarized below, with&#13;
detailed costs given in ANNEX B, and detailed component descriptions in ANNEX C.&#13;
3.16  Port Operations and Management (US$5.7 million). The purposes of this&#13;
component are to (a) strengthen Benin's competitiveness by reducing port operation&#13;
delays; (b) improve customs duty collection and freight handling performance by&#13;
increasing operational transparency; and (c) enhance user involvement in the definition&#13;
and implementation of port management improvements. It includes the following&#13;
elements:&#13;
(a)   Civil works to rationalize use of space within the port, in particular,&#13;
creating dedicated space outside the port compound for customs inspection&#13;
of containers and for used car handling and repair, and paving of heavily&#13;
trafficked surfaces (see IBRD Map 27429);&#13;
(b)   Short-term technical assistance and training to (i) PAC for operational&#13;
improvements, including use of Portware software and training of port&#13;
operators; (ii) to MTPT top management for preparation of a port operation&#13;

(iii) to port users and the Chamber of Commerce for information diffusion&#13;
and user group startup;&#13;
(c)   Short-term technical assistance and training to PAC for financial&#13;
management and cost accounting improvements, for updating of priority&#13;
port investment input to five-year priority program, and for&#13;
implementation of the civil works subcomponent, including final&#13;
engineering studies and works supervision.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
3.17   Road Repair, Maintenance, Safety and Network Management (US$32.1&#13;
million). The purposes of this component are to (a) redress the balance between road&#13;
investment and maintenance; (b) strengthen MTPT's capacity to program and manage road&#13;
investment and maintenance; (c) improve road user cost recovery: and (d) help reduce&#13;
poverty by reducing transport costs to/from rural areas and by increasing local labor-&#13;
intensive enterprises' access to road works contracts. It includes the following elements:&#13;
(a)    Priority civil works on MTPT's road network, including elimination of all&#13;
unpaved networ-k trouble spots, involving about 1,066 km of unpaved&#13;
roads, of whlich 400 km are currently cut during the rainy season; repair of&#13;
critical bridges and drainage works on about 850 km of priority unpaved&#13;
roads: periodic maintenance (regravelling) on about 600 km of priority&#13;
unpaved roads: DROA's office buildings upgrading and road safety&#13;
improvements at frequent accident locations on the paved network (see&#13;
IBRD Map 27427):&#13;
(b)    A program of short-term assistance, training, studies and equipment for&#13;
specific key management improvements within the Ministry in the areas of&#13;
annual updating of the five-year priority program projects'financial&#13;
managemenit, transport licensing, works contract management, bridge and&#13;
drainage maintenance, heavy equipment operation, collection of data on&#13;
road operators and road conditions, road maintenance financing&#13;

assistance, of which 36 local, 82 training sessions, 51 months of on-the-job&#13;
training sessions. 15 vehicles. 20 computers, 15 months of study tours, and&#13;
training of 12 specific staff );&#13;
(c)    Traffic Safety Support Program including short-term assistance. training&#13;
and studies to the CNSR and to MTPT for an action plan to improve road&#13;
and vehicle safety. including equipment for processing road safety data,&#13;
procedures for defining works to eliminate high accident locations,&#13;
revisions of rules of the road, improvements in accident reporting&#13;
procedures and in procedures for enforcing vehicle weight limits and rules&#13;
of the road. and measures for user participation in accident reduction&#13;
activities (total of 29 months of technical assistance, of which 9 local, 2&#13;
computers);&#13;
(d)    Private sector support to strengthen the implementation capacity of local&#13;
civil works enterprises for greater participation in road maintenance and&#13;
spot improvement contracts, through establishment of an office to assist&#13;
small and medium-sized enterprises by a specialized NGO, training and&#13;
support programs, studies to define measures to improve the private sector&#13;
regulatory environment, and startup of a public-private equipment pool&#13;
(total of 243 months of technical assistance, of which 152 months local);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
(e)   Overall program management. including studies required for annual&#13;
updating of the five-year priority program. annual works audits, final&#13;
engineering, preparation of bidding documents, and works supervision.&#13;
3.18  Rural Road Rehabilitation and Management (US$3.1 million). The purpose of&#13;
this component is to: (a) help alleviate rural poverty by reducing transport costs to/from&#13;
rural areas and improving road links to motivated communities; and (b) develop a national&#13;
rural road rehabilitation and maintenance strategy which would transfer rural road&#13;
management to local committees. It includes the following elements:&#13;
(a)   Civil works to rehabilitate a total of 300 km of rural roads in close&#13;
collaboration with motivated local communities in Cobly, Adjohoun,&#13;
Banikoara villages and three other areas, as a pilot for defining&#13;
Government's rural road strategy:&#13;
(b)   Introduction of a pilot, locally operated rural road maintenance program, to&#13;
be developed jointly by DROA and the local committees, including&#13;
assistance to DROA for developing and implementing new procedures for&#13;
programming, management and finance of rural road maintenance, and to&#13;
local and international NGOs who would assist local committees in setting&#13;
up the local organizations required for public education, collection of&#13;
funds, and mobilization of volunteer road maintenance crews (total of 306&#13;
months of TA. of which 149 local);&#13;
3.19   Urban Road Improvements and Traffic Management (US$4.3 million). The&#13;
purpose of this component is to improve traffic safety and transport conditions on the&#13;
primary road network in Cotonou through efficient traffic management. It includes the&#13;
following elements:&#13;
(a)   A program of road works required to improve road safety and traffic&#13;
conditions in the city of Cotonou, including elimination of high accident&#13;
and heavily congested intersections on main roads, 11 km of separate lanes&#13;
for two-wheeled vehicles on the most heavily traveled itinerary, and&#13;
renovation of the three main bus/truck stations plus creation of a&#13;
management mechanism for such stations (see IBRD Map 27428);&#13;
(b)   Equipment and vehicles required for the newly established Traffic&#13;
Management Unit within the municipality of Cotonou, short-term technical&#13;
assistance and training, studies for Cotonou's first traffic management&#13;
plan, studies for a first bus/truck station management plan and its&#13;
implementation, and definition and implementation of a mechanism for&#13;
urban user participation in traffic plan preparation and traffic safety&#13;
measures, through a local NGO.&#13;
3.20  Technical Assistance in All Components. In contrast to previous IDA projects,&#13;
the IDA-financed program components under this Credit support no full-time technical&#13;
assistance. Instead, terms of reference have been defined for specific tasks to be carried&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
out during short-term assignments, and local consultancies have been specified wherever&#13;
feasible. While all of port component technical assistance is external (30 months), 45&#13;
months out of 125 months of expertise required for the road component will be hired&#13;
locally, as will 144 of 240 months of NGO assistance for the rural road component, 7 of&#13;
67 months of rural road specialists, and 50 of 60 months of traffic plan experts in the&#13;
urban component (286 local out of 492 months total). All training in all components will&#13;
be carried out locally, except for study tours for maintenance programming training (see&#13;
tables in ANNEX C).&#13;
F. COST AND LOCAL FINANCING OF IDA COMPONENTS&#13;
Component Costs&#13;
3.21   Total cost of IDA-financed components of the program is estimated at&#13;
US$45.2 million (CFA franc 22.6 billion) together with Beninese counterpart funding, net&#13;
of taxes and duties but including physical and price contingencies. Base costs are in April&#13;
1995 prices, as determined by the appraisal mission on the basis of recent civil works&#13;
contracts. IDA financed components would be executed over a four-year period (March&#13;
1997 through December 2001). Price contingencies have been based on the following&#13;
annual inflation rates:&#13;

3.22   The proposed IDA Credit of US$40 million will finance 88 percent of the cost of&#13;
these components of the program net of taxes and duties. This will cover approximately&#13;
US$24 million of foreign costs (100 percent) and US$16 million of local costs (74&#13;
percent). Detailed IDA component financing is given in ANNEX B and is summarized in&#13;
the table below. The local counterpart share of US$5.2 million will be financed as&#13;
follows: (a) US$4.5 million by Government-- US$2.3 million from national budget and&#13;
US$2.2 million from Road Fund-- for periodic unpaved road maintenance repair of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
trouble spots, works and bridges on unpaved roads, buildings and equipment, and urban&#13;
road works; (b) US$0.6 million by beneficiaries, including US$0.3 million by small and&#13;
medium enterprises benefiting from the training and support operation (100 percent of the&#13;
operating cost of the support unit, 50 percent of the cost of staff training and 100 percent&#13;
of support by local expert), and US$0.3 million by local partners representing financing of&#13;
works on rural road during the IDA Credit period; and (c) US$0.1 million by the&#13;
Circonscription Urbaine (CU) under the Urban Road Component for operating costs of&#13;
the Traffic Management Unit, which could come from parking and station fees, and&#13;
US$0.4 million by PAC. Local counterpart funds provided from budget will be made&#13;
available through project accounts opened by MTPT (DROA) and AGETUR. First&#13;
deposit in these accounts is a condition of first disbursement under components B, C&#13;
and D. The project accounts will be replenished quarterly by the National Treasure.&#13;

G. PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Program Implementation Manual&#13;
3.23   Detailed project implementation procedures are recorded in a Program&#13;
Implementation Manual or PIM, organized in chapters by component. PIM contents are&#13;
detailed in ANNEX C and include detailed procurement arrangements, standard bidding&#13;
documents, key performance indicators, quarterly reporting formats, detailed IDA&#13;
supervision program, detailed procedures for ex-post supervision of road works,&#13;
environmental guidelines for road works, economic justification methodology, and copies&#13;
of official documents such as AGETUR's contract with MTPT and the Finance Ministry's&#13;
delegation of contract authority for road works to MTPT. The final PIM wchich has&#13;
been agreed upon before negotiations will be adopted by the Government prior to credit&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
effectiveness. It will be updated if necessary during program implementation with IDA&#13;
concurrence. Programn implementation, arrangements and Credit and program&#13;
coordination, are summarized below (details in ANNEX C).&#13;
IDA Credit Coordination&#13;
3.24  An IDA Credit Coordinator, under the responsibility of Chief of staff (directeur du&#13;
cabinet), will coordinate project implementation, including (i) overall coordination of the&#13;
IDA components; (ii) liaison with the Programming and Coordination Unit which&#13;
manages the program as a whole; and (iii) management of expenditures under the IDA&#13;
Credit, including Credit allocation on the basis of the data processed by DROA, PAC and&#13;
AGETUR. Before negotiation, MTPT nominated an accountant acceptable to IDA who&#13;
will work under the credit coordinator's authority. DROA, PAC and AGETUR would&#13;
carry out program preparation, commitments monitoring, expenditure accounting, and&#13;
withdrawal application supervision for their respective components. This documentation&#13;
would then be transmitted to the Credit Coordinator who would consolidate the&#13;
commitments and expenditures accounts for the overall Credit, monitor the Credit&#13;
allocation, and be responsible for the execution of the annual audit. By or just after&#13;
project effectiveness the accountants in each execution agency and at the credit&#13;
coordination level will have training on IDA's credit management.&#13;
3.25  The borrower will carry out no later than 30 month after effectiveness, jointly with&#13;
the Association and other donors, a mid-term review of the progress made in the carrying&#13;
out of the Project. The review will cover: (a) the implementation of measures designed to&#13;
strengthen the financial reporting, monitoring, accounting and auditing capabilities of the&#13;
different agencies of the Borrower involved in the implementation of the Program; (b) the&#13;
overall progress made in the Program and Credit implementation; (c) the performance of&#13;
PAC, AGETUR and MTPT as executing agencies for their respective parts of the IDA&#13;
financed components; (d) the adequacy of the Borrower's counterpart funding as well as&#13;
the level of budgetary allocations and actual expenditure for routine maintenance; (e) the&#13;
working of the Road Fund; and (f) the need for redesign and restructuring of Program&#13;
components experiencing implementation difficulties. Not later than one month prior to&#13;
such mid-tern review, the Borrower will furnish to the Association a report, for its review&#13;
and comnments on the above topics, including an evaluation of the progress achieved in&#13;
complying with Program implementation, and recommendations resulting from the&#13;
studies conducted under the Program.&#13;
Port Component of Cotonou Operations and Maintenance Implementation&#13;
3.26  The port component would be implemented by PAC. IDA Credit funds for port&#13;
infrastructure works and PAC support will be made available to PAC by the Governmnent&#13;
under an agreement which will be signed prior to Credit effectiveness. Two thirds of the&#13;
amount will be onlent at commercial loan terrns (7.1 percent) and the remaining made&#13;
available to PAC as an equity contribution. Delegation of authority for procurement for&#13;
works, consultant services and training to PAC will be part of the agreement. Since PAC&#13;
has demonstrated its capacity to manage contracts under the recently completed Transport&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project (Cr. 1807-BEN), it could carry out&#13;
procurement for MTPT and other entities involved in the port component. PAC will hire&#13;
consultants for engineering studies, works supervision, and studies to be financed under&#13;
the program. PAC's training program, focused on port operations and financial&#13;
management, and agreed with IDA during appraisal, will be updated each year, according&#13;
to the results of training to date and in light of operational priorities.&#13;
3.27  Before negotiations, Government transmitted to IDA, all legislation, decrees, and&#13;
regulations required to (a) reinforce PAC's authority in the management of port&#13;
operations; (b) end SOBEMAP's monopoly of container handling by opening the market&#13;
to one or more private companies; and (c) revise licensing regulations for private port&#13;
operators to bring them under PAC's jurisdiction. Prior to October 31 of each year of&#13;
program implementation, PAC will prepare and transmit to IDA for its review, the five-&#13;
year priority program, prior to its inclusion in the overall five-year transport program,&#13;
along with five-year financial projections for PAC. PAC has agreed to include in its&#13;
submission, only those investments (a) required to improve port infrastructure whose&#13;
economic return is greater than 12 percent, and (b) for which PAC's ability to undertake&#13;
such investments is demonstrated by financial projections based on principles and formats&#13;
agreed at appraisal.&#13;
Road Repairs, Maintenance, Safety and Network Management Component&#13;
Implementation&#13;
3.28  The road component will be carried out by MTPT through DROA. To improve its&#13;
efficiency DROA will be reorganized and strengthened (ANNEX B3 of the PIM). Prior&#13;
to effectiveness, the Borrower shall take initial steps agreed upon for the reorganization of&#13;
DROA and shall pursue the implementation of this reorganization during the Program&#13;
execution. The Finance Ministry will delegate to MTPT, authority for issuing calls for&#13;
bids, awarding contracts, and managing contracts for (a) routine, periodic maintenance and&#13;
rehabilitation works on the upaved network, whether financed by the Road Fund or by the&#13;
Credit; (b) DROA's buildings upgrading; and (c) elimination of trouble spots and unpaved&#13;
road rehabilitation. DROA will hire consultants to carry out engineering studies and&#13;
works supervision financed by the Credit, and consultants recruited for works supervision&#13;
should participate in the finalization of bidding documents for these works, and in the&#13;
analysis of bids. Engineering studies will include an environmental assessment of the&#13;
impact of works, following the environmental guidelines to be agreed on at negotiations.&#13;
Final engineering studies and bidding documents for the first slice of works and technical&#13;
assistance are being prepared and are expected to be finalized by Credit effectiveness.&#13;
3.29  Prior to negotiations, Government transmitted to IDA: (a) draft revised&#13;
statutes for the Road Fund; (b) draft contracts for toll collection subcontracting; (c) an&#13;
action plan for restructuring of Road Fund staff; and (d) evidence of the start of staff&#13;
restructuring implementation. New statutes for the Road Fund, road toll contracts with&#13;
private firms, and signature of single-man contracts with the 347 surplus road maintenance&#13;
staff are measures required to ensure Government's undertaking to provide sufficient&#13;
funds for routine road maintenance. Government agreed to these measures at appraisal,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
and to the provision of CFA franc 1.5 billion in 1996, increasing to CFA franc 2.635&#13;
billion in 1998, for routine road maintenance of MTPT's paved and unpaved network.&#13;
3.30  Government further agreed at appraisal to transmit to IDA, minutes of the first&#13;
meeting of the Road Fund's new board of directors, and copies of the new contracts of the&#13;
347 road maintenance staff, as a condition of Credit effectiveness. Prior to October 31&#13;
of each year of program implementation, MTPT will prepare and transmit to IDA for&#13;
review, its submission for the five-year priority program, prior to its inclusion in the&#13;
overall five-year transport program, including road maintenance programming and&#13;
budgeting. The 1997-2001 priority program was reviewed during negotiations.&#13;
Government will not undertake any new works financed by the Credit unless it submits to&#13;
IDA evidence of actual availability of budgeted funds and actual performance of routine&#13;
maintenance works during each year, and payment of counterpart funds for prior contracts&#13;
financed by the Credit. Government has agreed to deposit in the Road Fund on a quarterly&#13;
basis, no later than three months after they have been collected, fuel taxes and road taxes&#13;
collected on its behalf. Should the Road Fund not be able to mobilize sufficient funds to&#13;
finance road maintenance at the agreed level. Government will increase its allocation to&#13;
the Road Fund to make up the difference. With respect to the counterpart funds, the&#13;
Borrower shall open a Road Funds Project Account, will make first deposits and will&#13;
replenish them thereafter. Prior to June 30 of each year, Government will provide IDA&#13;
with audit reports of Road Fund accounts, performed by an independent external auditor&#13;
and based on terms of reference acceptable to IDA. Contracts for upgrading of DROA&#13;
offices and equipment purchase included in this component will not be signed by&#13;
Government before IDA receives the decree and the actual assignment of staff involved in&#13;
the DROA reorganization, as outlined in the Program Implementation Manual.&#13;
3.31   The Private Sector Support Program will be implemented by DROA through a&#13;
contract with a specialized NGO, covering all elements of the program. Annual training&#13;
and support programs will be defined on an annual basis in close collaboration with&#13;
beneficiaries, and forwarded to IDA for approval before October 31 of the preceding&#13;
year. Program beneficiaries will contribute to program operating and staff training costs&#13;
at a level which should cover at least the unit's operating costs, net of expatriate staff. The&#13;
Traffic Safety Support Program will be prepared and its implementation managed by&#13;
DROA in close coordination with CNSR. CNSR will analyze bids for studies and&#13;
technical assistance, and CNSR's representatives will be members of the bid award&#13;
committee. Final terms of reference for studies, technical assistance and training are being&#13;
prepared and are expected to be finalized by project effectiveness.&#13;
Rural Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Component Implementation&#13;
3.32 Rural road maintenance works will be implemented by MTPT through DROA,&#13;
under the same conditions as the road component with respect to programming and&#13;
contract administration, including use of the same standard bidding documents. A&#13;
detailed definition of the operation of the National Technical Council for Rural Roads&#13;
(CTN), which will be responsible for supervising the execution of the pilot maintenance&#13;
and rehabilitation operations, and defining a national strategy for rural roads to be applied&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
in future is a condition of initial disbursement for this component. IDA's agreement on&#13;
the rehabilitation work program for each rural community selected will require adherence&#13;
to agreed selection principles. It will be conditioned on receipt by IDA of the consultant's&#13;
monitoring and evaluation report, indicating that local partners have actually carried out or&#13;
caused to be carried out, initial site preparation for rehabilitation works and manual&#13;
routine maintenance works for which they are responsible, representing their counterpart&#13;
contribution.&#13;
3.33  Works programming and phasing will be carried out in close collaboration with&#13;
local communities responsible for individual road sections with the help of a specialized&#13;
NGO. Works will be restricted to rehabilitation or maintenance of only those roads or&#13;
tracks on the approved list. Work programming will be carried out by local communities&#13;
and final program will be agreed upon by CTN which will include local community&#13;
partners. No rehabilitation or maintenance works will be carried out with IDA financing&#13;
until arrangements required for financing and carrying out maintenance have been drawn&#13;
up and finalized through written agreement with the communities involved.&#13;
Urban Roads Improvement and Traffic Management Component Implementation&#13;
3.34 The Urban Traffic Component will be implemented by DROA, using the same&#13;
standard bidding documents as for the road component. The urban works agency,&#13;
AGETUR, will be hired for procurement and supervision of studies and works within its&#13;
domain of competence, under a subcontracting agreement (contrat de maitrise d'ouvrage&#13;
dgleguj). Such works would in principle include all works in this component except&#13;
works involving asphalt paving. IDA credit funds for urban works, to be carried out by&#13;
AGETUR, will be made available to AGETUR by the Government under an agreement&#13;
which will be signed prior to Credit effectiveness. AGETUR executing fees would be&#13;
financed by the Credit, up to 4.5 percent of the cost of engineering studies and works&#13;
carried out under the subcontracting agreement. The Borrower shall open a AGETUR&#13;
Project Account, will make the first counterpart deposits and replenish them quarterly&#13;
thereafter. Bidding procedures and contract award would follow AGETUR's rules, and&#13;
would be subject to the same ex-post review by the Finance Ministry as under the ongoing&#13;
Urban Rehabilitation and Management Project financed by IDA (Cr. 2338-BEN). DROA&#13;
and AGETUR will hire consultants to carry out engineering studies and works supervision&#13;
(about 30 percent by DROA, 70 percent by AGETUR; see para. 3.38).&#13;
3.35  The establishment of the Traffic Management Unit within the Municipality of&#13;
Cotonou and hiring of competent staff for it, which had previously been envisaged as a&#13;
condition of Credit effectiveness, actually occurred in January 1996. The Technical&#13;
Steering Committee for traffic management will be enlarged to include representatives of&#13;
users by December 1996 and the traffic management plan will be completed by March 31,&#13;
1997. Adherence to agreed works selection procedures and finalization of the traffic&#13;
management plan are conditions of IDA's financing of the works program to be&#13;
financed under this component.&#13;

H. PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT&#13;
Procurement&#13;
3.36   Table 3-6 below presents a summary of expected procurement by category of&#13;
expenditure. Detailed features of procurement arrangements are provided in ANNEXES&#13;
B and C. Unless otherwise indicated below, procurement arrangements for the items&#13;
financed by the Credit are as follows: (a) all equipment and civil works contracts will be&#13;
awarded on the basis of competitive bidding (ICB or NCB for works and ICB, NCB and&#13;
International Shopping for Goods) in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines; (b) all civil&#13;
works construction will be supervised by consultants acceptable to IDA under agreed&#13;
terms of reference; (c) consultants and experts for technical assistance will be recruited in&#13;
accordance with provisions stated below; (d) procurement decisions for civil works and&#13;
goods in excess of US$200,000 equivalent, for consulting services with firms in excess of&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent, and for consulting services with individual or training activities&#13;
in excess of US$50,000 (covering over 80 percent of all procurement) will be subject to&#13;
prior approval by IDA; and (e) post-review procedures will be applied for contracts under&#13;
the above thresholds. Contracts and services financed by other financing agencies will&#13;
follow the rules of the respective agencies. Contracts for civil works which are unlikely to&#13;
attract international competition will be awarded on the basis of procedures for locally&#13;
advertised competitive bidding (NCB), according to procedures which have been&#13;
reviewed and are acceptable to IDA.&#13;

3.37  The Bank's standard bidding documents will be used. Bank standard bidding&#13;
documents and standard bid evaluation reports for goods and civil works under ICB, civil&#13;
works under NCB which could interest local SMEs, and consultant services, and&#13;
processing time for key procurement activities were agreed at negotiations. Government&#13;
also agreed to submit to IDA for review, draft legal texts for procurement arrangements,&#13;
especially for bid evaluation, responsibility for processing in a timely manner, and delega-&#13;
tion of contract award to DROA or AGETUR for works related to road maintenance, spot&#13;
improvement works and improvement of traffic condition within Cotonou.&#13;
3.38  Civil Works. All contracts for civil works in excess of US$500,000 equivalent&#13;
will be awarded on the basis of ICB. Contracts for civil works under US$500,000 equiva-&#13;
lent but not exceeding US$13 million in aggregate may be awarded on the basis of NCB,&#13;
in accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA. International enterprises are best&#13;
qualified to execute major improvement works on unpaved roads or bridges, and works on&#13;
paved roads under the road component, local contractors are not yet qualified to do such&#13;
works, even minor works on paved roads. On the other hand, international firms are not&#13;
interested in minor works at dispersed locations on the unpaved network or at the port site,&#13;
nor in minor scattered improvements on the urban network, works well suited to local&#13;
contractors' abilities. Therefore, 63 percent of the works is expected to be awarded under&#13;
ICB and 37 percent on the basis of NCB. Foreign firms, if interested, will not be excluded&#13;
from participation in NCB.&#13;
3.39  Consultancies. All consultancies financed by IDA will be contracted in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (August 1981).&#13;
Services for promotion and support of SMEs, for representation of users under the urban&#13;
roads component, and for assistance to local communities under the rural roads&#13;
component would be executed by experienced NGOs. During negotiations, Government&#13;
confirmed that consultants responsible for works supervision will also be responsible for&#13;
design and updating of bidding documents, and will actively participate in bid evaluation.&#13;
Contracting and supervision of 70 percent of works and consultant services under the&#13;
traffic improvement subcomponent will be executed by AGETUR, 30 percent by DROA.&#13;
AGETUR operating expenditures for this task will be paid under annual contract&#13;
agreements to be signed between MTPT and AGETUR; annual contract amounts will be&#13;
estimated on the basis of actual expenditures submitted for IDA approval. Payment&#13;
against these contracts will be made as the works are implemented. NGOs will be hired&#13;
after careful selection following a consultation made on the same basis as for consultant&#13;
services.&#13;
3.40 Goods for DROA, DFR (Directorate of Road Fund), CNSR and the Traffic&#13;
Management Unit will be procured under ICB procedures. The exceptions to ICB&#13;
procurement will be for goods contracts estimated to cost less than or equal to US$50,000&#13;
equivalent each, which in aggregate will not exceed US$240,000. For these contracts,&#13;
goods could be procured under NCB or National Shopping. National Shopping will be&#13;
limited to contracts estimated to cost less than US$20,000 each, which in aggregate will&#13;
not exceed US$ 100,000.&#13;

Disbursement&#13;
3.41   The Credit is expected to be fully disbursed by June 30, 2001 and the Credit&#13;
closing date will be December 31, 2001. The estimated quarterly disbursement schedule&#13;
for IDA Credit and the detailed disbursement schedule. Credit categories and disburse-&#13;
ment percentages are shown in ANNEX B. The disbursement forecasts take into account&#13;
the advanced stage of procurement preparation which will allow a quick start of the&#13;
project. The Credit will be disbursed as follows:&#13;

3.42   Special Accounts. To facilitate disbursement and reduce the volume of&#13;
withdrawal applications, Special Accounts, will be opened in CFA franc for DROA, PAC&#13;
and AGETUR at a commercial bank acceptable to IDA. The authorized allocations&#13;
amount to US$1,000,000 equivalent (DROA), US$250,000 equivalent (PAC) and&#13;
US$150,000 equivalent (AGETUR). The amounts are estimated to cover about four&#13;
months of expenditures. The Special Account opened by AGETUR would finance&#13;
expenditures under Categories 1(d), 3(d) and 4. The Special Account opened by DROA&#13;
would finance expenditures under Categories I (b), (c), 2, 3 (b) and (c). The Special&#13;
Account opened by PAC would finance expenditures under Categories 1(a) and 3(a). The&#13;
Special Accounts will be opened prior to any disbursement. Upon effectiveness of the&#13;
Credit, an amount of US$500,000 equivalent (DROA), US$125,000 (PAC) and&#13;
US$75,000 (AGETUR), representing 50 percent of the authorized allocations, will be&#13;
deposited in the Special Accounts. The remaining balance will be made available when&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
needed. The Special Accounts will be used for all payments representing less than 20&#13;
percent of the authorized allocations. Replenishments would be submitted monthly and&#13;
include bank statement and reconciliation statement.&#13;
3.43  All replenishment requests would be fully documented except for: (a) contracts of&#13;
less than US$200,000 equivalent for civil works and equipment; (b) contract of less than&#13;
US$ 100,000 for consulting services by firms; (c) contracts of less than US$50,000 for&#13;
consulting services by individuals; (d) training, studies and operating expenses (SOEs)&#13;
which may be claimed on the basics of statements of expenditures. All supporting&#13;
documents for SOEs will be retained by DROA, PAC and AGETUR for review by&#13;
periodic Bank supervision missions and external auditors.&#13;
I. ACCOUNTING, AUDITING AND REPORTING&#13;
3.44  The accounting for Credit expenditures and Special Accounts transactions&#13;
including statements of expenditures would be maintained by DROA, AGETUR and PAC&#13;
for their respective components. All expenditures under the Credit will be recorded and&#13;
consolidated by the Credit Coordinator, who will countersign all withdrawal applications.&#13;
Agreement was reached during negotiations that DROA, AGETUR and PAC have&#13;
Credit accounts, Special Accounts and statement of expenditures audited annually by&#13;
qualified independent auditors acceptable to IDA. Auditors missions will include the&#13;
detailed audits of Credit accounts and SOEs with an opinion, the audit of the Special&#13;
Accounts with a separate opinion and a management letter which includes the analysis of&#13;
the internal control and accounting procedures along with recommendations to&#13;
management. Auditors' reports will be submitted to IDA not later than six months after&#13;
the close of their fiscal/financial year. In addition to Credit audit reports, AGETUR and&#13;
PAC will also furnish to IDA, not later than six months after the end of their&#13;
fiscal/financial year, separate audit reports on their component and on their operations.&#13;
Selection of the project auditors to IDA's satisfaction is a condition of credit&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
3.45  DROA, AGETUR and PAC will each prepare quarterly progress reports covering&#13;
all subcomponents within one month after the end of each quarter. These reports will&#13;
include: (i) progress achieved against agreed implementation and disbursements&#13;
schedules; (ii) key performance indicators; and (iii) work programs and cost estimates for&#13;
the coming quarter and for the total program. Performance indicators are listed in&#13;
ANNEX B. These reports will be consolidated by the Credit Coordinator into a single&#13;
quarterly report which will be submitted to IDA. The main purpose of the reports will be&#13;
to provide timely and updated information on the implementation of the components,&#13;
highlighting issues and problem areas, recommending actions and commenting on&#13;
progress in resolving previous reconmmendations. DROA, AGETUR and PAC will&#13;
prepare a completion report within six months of the final disbursement in accordance&#13;
with IDA guidelines. Reporting formats and requirements, and key performance&#13;
indicators were agreed with DROA, AGETUR and PAC during negotiations.&#13;
Agreement was obtained during negotiations that DROA, AGETUR and PAC submit to&#13;
IDA, copies of all consultants' reports and studies financed under the proposed program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
J. SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
3.46  Agreement was obtained during negotiations that MTPT hold a launch workshop&#13;
as soon as the Credit is effective, and that there is a mid-term review by IDA two years&#13;
from the date of Credit effectiveness (i.e. around April 1998), during which the status of&#13;
the entire program will be reviewed in detail. During that mid-term review, particular&#13;
attention will be paid to: (i) compliance with covenants, particularly the financial and audit&#13;
covenants; (ii) progress in implementing program components; the implementation of&#13;
PAC's financial priority plan with respect to debt service and accounts receivable; the&#13;
road subcomponents and institutional strengthening results and variance from the&#13;
appraisal estimates; (iii) status of the road network maintenance funding through the road&#13;
fund; and (iv) status of the preparation of the national rural road strategy based on the&#13;
results of the IDA-supported pilot operations. The review will be jointly carried out by&#13;
IDA, Government, DROA, the Road Fund and PAC with the participation of other donors&#13;
involved in the sector. Corrective measures may be proposed as a result of this review&#13;
including necessary modifications in the scope of the proposed program and in the&#13;
Implementation Manual which could be gradually applied to all projects financed by&#13;
external donors.&#13;
3.47  The proposed supervision program for IDA components and key performance&#13;
indicators for monitoring their progress were designed during appraisal and have been&#13;
confirmed during negotiations. The two first years will require 22 staff weeks of&#13;
supervision, and the following years 20 staff weeks per year. A table showing proposed&#13;
mission activities and staffing, and a list of performance indicators are provided in&#13;
ANNEX B. Routine supervision by IDA should normally include an engineer&#13;
experienced in road maintenance and periodically a procurement specialist. Full-scale&#13;
missions should include a financial analyst, a training specialist, an urban transport&#13;
specialist and a port specialist.&#13;
3.48   Supervision will be carried out in close collaboration with IDA's Country&#13;
Operations Department in order to ensure that the road investment and maintenance&#13;
program is consistent with macroeconomic conditions. Particular attention will be paid to&#13;
Road Fund operations during supervision. Preparation of the priority program with its&#13;
annual slices will require special supervision, with participation by transport economists.&#13;
IDA's annual review of the priority program will require expertise in economic analysis&#13;
and in road maintenance and construction standards. IDA will play a major role in donor&#13;
coordination during the annual donors' meetings, where these programs will be revised&#13;
and updated. The meetings will take place during IDA supervision missions.&#13;
Involvement of a number of small enterprises in civil works execution is another activity&#13;
requiring close supervision and special attention.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
4. BENEFITS, IMPACTS AND RISKS&#13;
A. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
4.1   Project Benefits. All port and road improvements will reduce transport time and&#13;
cost through less vehicle operating costs, and encourage trade and agricultural production.&#13;
In the port, improvements in productivity yield shipper savings in road transport, incurred&#13;
when port congestion in Cotonou diverts traffic to Lome, and physical improvements in the&#13;
port will yield cost savings to forklift and other cargo-handling vehicles. On national, rural&#13;
and urban roads, improved road surfaces yield vehicle operating cost savings. Other non-&#13;
quantified benefits are expected to flow from IDA-supported activities which improve&#13;
management and planning. Effective use of the five-year priority program as an investment&#13;
tool should result in higher rates of return on transport sector investment as a whole.&#13;
Development of a community-based, demand-driven rural roads rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance strategy will likewise lead to more effective resource use. Better contract&#13;
management and better planning based on better road data will mean more roads can be&#13;
maintained with the same budget. Safety and traffic management activities will reduce the&#13;
cost of traffic accidents, in terms of human life and productivity and damage to vehicles.&#13;
Economic analyses for individual IDA components are summarized below, with details&#13;
provided in ANNEX E.&#13;
4.2   Port Operations. There are three types of benefits expected from investment in&#13;
civil works and operational improvements in the port: (i) reductions in cost of trucking&#13;
goods off-loaded in Lome when Cotonou's port is congested, and then trucked back to&#13;
Cotonou for delivery in Benin or Niger; (ii) cost savings to forklift and other cargo-handling&#13;
vehicles, through dockside paving and through reduction of congestion by creating&#13;
dedicated space outside the port compound for container inspection and used car activities;&#13;
(iii) reductions in income losses to PAC, SOBEMAP and private operators who lose&#13;
business when port traffic is diverted to Lome. Diversion of traffic to Lome occurs when&#13;
dock occupancy rates exceed 70 percent (saturation point), expected to occur in 1998, if&#13;
there is no improvement in productivity, or in 2001 with IDA-supported improvements.&#13;
The total of benefits from these three types of cost savings in a single year is estimated at&#13;
CFA franc 2,193 million, of the same order of magnitude as the cost of all IDA-financed&#13;
port improvements (CFA franc 2,041 million). The ERR is estimated at 250 percent and&#13;
the NPV is about US$7 million using a discount rate of 12 percent.&#13;
4.3   Road Repair and Maintenance. Given that the four IDA components are but a&#13;
portion of a larger priority program, and in order to assist in the definition of this program&#13;
and to permit rational selection of investments for IDA and other donor financing from it,&#13;
the economic analysis carried out during preparation covered all road investments proposed&#13;
for Government's five-year priority program. This analysis included section-by-section&#13;
review of proposed trouble spot repairs and bridges and drainage works to take into&#13;
account, works recently carried out in the Transport Infrastructure Rehabilitation and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
Maintenance Project (Cr. 1807-BEN), and identification of optimal maintenance strategies&#13;
for paved and unpaved roads, in terms of maximizing the number of practicable itineraries&#13;
(minimization of present value of net maintenance costs). ERRs were also calculated for&#13;
the resulting maintenance cost flows. Cost stream-s included the cost of eliminating trouble&#13;
spots and bridge and drainage works, both required to bring key network sections up to a&#13;
service level where maintenance is possible, in addition to maintenance costs. Benefits are&#13;
taken to be savings in vehicle operating costs due to improved road surfaces, with fuel&#13;
shadow priced at CFA franc 140 a liter; time savings are not taken into account. The base&#13;
case is defined as continuation of the lowest service level, or deterioration to the lowest&#13;
service level, at which vehicles can still actually use the road. This is the only way to&#13;
generate a baseline level of vehicle operating costs to compare with the with-investment&#13;
case, although in actual fact, in a do-nothing case with no road maintenance, roads cease to&#13;
be practicable and traffic would virtually cease. Not even minimal maintenance costs are&#13;
included in the base case, because in their present state, the roads are not maintainable&#13;
without the repairs of trouble spots and bridges, and the road standards in the with-&#13;
investment case are already set at a minimum level.&#13;
4.4    The ERRs for works on the 61 sections of unpaved roads included for financing&#13;
under the proposed IDA Credit range from 300 percent to six percent, depending on the&#13;
section. Six of the 61 sections show ERR below 12 percent. Since these are itineraries&#13;
lacking any possible detour in case of impassibility, they will be retained in the priority&#13;
program; engineering studies will review the possibility of lowering technical standards on&#13;
these sections. The weighted average of the ERR for all unpaved road investments taken&#13;
together is 103 percent, and the NPV is estimated at US$85 million. While it is not possible&#13;
to quantify the benefits of the other activities financed under this component-- road safety&#13;
improvements and short-termn assistance, training and studies for management&#13;
improvements, strengthening of SMEs, building renovations, and overall IDA Credit&#13;
management-- these activities will certainly generate benefits by lowering traffic accident&#13;
rates, improving the efficiency of resource use, and boosting competition in the private&#13;
construction sector.&#13;
4.5    Rural Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance. There is no reliable or accurate&#13;
way to estimate future income benefits to pilot area rural residents from additional&#13;
agricultural production expected to be induced by better rural road conditions. Farmers can&#13;
be expected to make rational choices of itineraries to propose for rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance, based on their own assessment of benefits likely to accrue to them. The&#13;
component has been designed, in fact, precisely so as to apply selection criteria for&#13;
screening programs eligible for Governm-ent participation, which takes into account user&#13;
savings, increased agricultural production, and social and poverty impacts. Should it not be&#13;
possible to calculate an ERR, other simple criteria will be used, such as population density&#13;
or agricultural production per km of road to be included. Taking a broader view, however,&#13;
this component represents the minimum investment required for Government to design a&#13;
workable rural roads strategy, needed to replace the unsuccessful and uneconomic&#13;
approaches of the past, which have re,.ulted in costly repeated rehabilitation of&#13;
unmaintained rural roads. The requirement of commnunity contribution to program costs,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
sufficient to ensure routine maintenance of included itineraries, has been adopted as a&#13;
means to exclude economically unjustified investments from being financed under this pilot&#13;
program.&#13;
4.6   Urban Road Repair and Traffic Management. Vehicle operating cost savings&#13;
from improved traffic circulation due to both civil works and start-up of a traffic&#13;
management unit are expected to be substantial in Cotonou. given the high volumes of&#13;
traffic and the expected reductions in travel time. On the 11 km trip between Godomey and&#13;
Sobebra intersections (see IBRD Map 27428), the current conflict between four-wheeled&#13;
and two-wheeled vehicles and intersection bottlenecks have reduced speeds to around 20&#13;
km/hr, compared to a norm of 40 km/hr. creating delays of around 22 minutes, or 50&#13;
percent of a more normal trip time. Peak traffic volumes on this trip are in the 40,000 -&#13;
80,000 veh/hour range, of which about 70 percent are two-wheelers. Substantial&#13;
improvements on this major itinerary will result from the implementation of the traffic plan,&#13;
following which traffic improvement works such as modal separation, intersection&#13;
reconfiguration and signaling, and parking improvements would be financed. Proposed&#13;
works would be required to demonstrate an ERR of at least 12 percent to qualify for&#13;
financing under this component.&#13;
B. SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
4.7   Benefits from User Participation in Decision-Making. The adoption of a&#13;
participatory approach in the preparation of the transport sector strategy during 1992-94 was&#13;
a fundamental departure from previous decision-making traditions, and it succeeded in&#13;
changing participants' expectations of their roles. This has begun to raise expectations&#13;
among a wider circle of participants, and it is to this end that the IDA Credit supports&#13;
activities to revive user participation mechanisms in port operations and to develop new&#13;
ones for main road and rural road maintenance. These activities will continue during the&#13;
five-year Credit period to make transport agencies increasingly accountable to stakeholders.&#13;
4.8   Benefits to Women. The reconnecting of agricultural areas to the main road&#13;
networks will encourage development of trade activities in which women are particularly&#13;
active. Improvement of bus/truck station environments and management in the urban roads&#13;
component will also benefit women, who are the main users of these facilities.&#13;
4.9   Environmental Protection. Benin has already begun to implement its&#13;
Environmental Action Plan or (EAP), which provides a diagnosis, an environmental&#13;
strategy and an action plan. The EAP was approved by the Ministers' Council on June 16,&#13;
1993, and an Environmental Council was created and a Director appointed in 1994. The&#13;
main problems highlighted in the EAP are the reduction of plant cover, the spread of all&#13;
forns of erosion, a general reduction in water quality, and uncontrolled urban growth. In&#13;
both urban and rural areas, a lack of infrastructure, poor infrastructure management, and&#13;
poverty are factors which encourage environmental deterioration. The proposed Credit&#13;
therefore indirectly supports the EAP by increasing road infrastructure capacity, improving&#13;
road maintenance programmning, financing and execution, and improving road safety.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
4.10  More directly, the Credit also supports the EAP by providing for development of&#13;
criteria for a transport environmental action plan and environmental guidelines (see&#13;
ANNEX D). The objective is not only to mitigate, through better maintenance and design,&#13;
the negative impacts of road construction and maintenance activities, such as soil erosion&#13;
and flooding, but also to promote environmental protection. Transport works financed by&#13;
this Credit will contribute to sustainable trends in enviromnental improvement, by&#13;
improving water management and using road infrastructure, in particular drainage&#13;
structures, as a vehicle for improving drainage and reducing erosion.&#13;
C. POVERTY ASPECTS&#13;
4.11   Transport and Poverty. Two of the factors underlying the high rate of poverty in&#13;
Benin could be substantially alleviated through transport sector measures: difficulty of&#13;
access to potentially productive rural areas, and the high rate of unemployment.&#13;
Rehabilitation and improvement of rural roads do not in themselves guarantee the&#13;
development of agricultural activities, but competitive agricultural production cannot occur&#13;
without reliable roads which are kept in fair condition. In urban areas, especially Cotonou,&#13;
unemployment has, until recently, been a major problem, due to a lack of job opportunities&#13;
in the modem sector and to the restructuring of the public sector during the early years of&#13;
structural adjustment.&#13;
4.12   Poverty Alleviation. To support the country's poverty alleviation objectives, the&#13;
transport strategy aims to: (a) reduce the cost of transport overall; (b) improve access to&#13;
isolated areas in particular; and (c) support operations which create job opportunities in both&#13;
formal and informal sectors. The proposed Credit supports improvements to rural roads&#13;
based on producers' and traders' priorities which are expected to increase access to inputs&#13;
and markets, thereby increasing income potential. In particular, reducing seasonal&#13;
variability in access can mitigate the factors underlying seasonal poverty in rural areas, and&#13;
increasing reliability of access reduces the vulnerability of the rural population as a whole.&#13;
The proposed Credit, following the successful example of the ongoing Urban Rehabilitation&#13;
and Management Project, favors the use of labor-intensive civil works design using low-&#13;
skilled employment for rural road works and works to be carried out in the city of Cotonou.&#13;
The Credit also provides direct support to develop the capacity of SMEs in carrying out&#13;
public sector road maintenance contracts. In its employment-creating aspects, the proposed&#13;
Credit provides parallel support of Government's unemployment reduction program,&#13;
launched recently in the context of a comprehensive poverty alleviation strategy, and is&#13;
consistent with private sector development measures receiving-IDA support under SAL III.&#13;
D. PROGRAM RISKS&#13;
4.13  Given that the program has been designed to build on existing positive initiatives&#13;
and achievements in the sector, risks relating to the IDA components are limited to new and&#13;
innovative activities supported by the IDA Credit. These are: (a) inadequate replenishment&#13;
of Road Fund; (b) slow restructuring of DROA; (c) uncertainty about involvement of local&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
communities and NGOs in rural road maintenance; and (d) weak adherence of some parties&#13;
to the priority program. The first risk involves being able to collect adequate resources for&#13;
road maintenance; the diversification of funding sources and the fact that authority for direct&#13;
collection of funds is given to Road Fund staff, along with the gradual reduction of general&#13;
budget support, are intended to minimize the likelihood of this risk. Also, the&#13;
diversification of funding sources will focus on road tolls, a financing source of proven&#13;
practicality and high yields in Benin.&#13;
4.14 Concerning the second risk, DROA has led the design of the reorganization process&#13;
with the support of outside consultants, and therefore the elements of this restructuring have&#13;
already been accepted and assimilated by DROA staff. The restructuring process was&#13;
begun from within in 1991 and there has been constant improvement over the period.&#13;
DROA will also be able to call on specific external assistance as needed, financed by the&#13;
Credit, of the same kind which it has successfully defined and made use of during the&#13;
transport strategy preparation and the preparation of the proposed IDA components. A&#13;
training program, closely linked to technical assistance, will define on an ongoing basis, the&#13;
types of training required by the new DROA structure.&#13;
4.15   The third risk involves mobilization of local communities and the effectiveness of&#13;
NGOs expected to provide support to these communities. IDA has already acquired some&#13;
experience in this area from the use of similar arrangements in the Rural Water and&#13;
Sanitation Project of May 1994 (Credit 2622-BEN), as those proposed for rural road&#13;
maintenance in this subcomponent. Local and/or international NGOs will be used to offer&#13;
support to local communities. NGOs will be carefully screened well in advance of field&#13;
operations, and will be offered external assistance during the first three years of the&#13;
component. Should local communities' motivation be low in respect of organizing&#13;
community associations and the collection of local counterpart funds, this will not&#13;
compromise pilot activity objectives. Rather it would mean a slower pace of&#13;
implementation of this specific element, and of Government's definition of a new rural road&#13;
maintenance strategy.&#13;
4.16 The fourth risk involves continuous adherence of all partners (Government and&#13;
donors) financing to the priority program. All donors were involved in the definition of the&#13;
TSS which proposed the priority program. The main donors commented on the&#13;
Government Strategy Note. A yearly joint program review and periodic donor round table&#13;
meetings will ensure continuing donor commitment and dialogue with the Government.&#13;

1. Compte tenu de la situation g6ographique du Benin et de la structure de son&#13;
economie, le secteur tertiaire, et en particulier le commerce joue un r6le tres important&#13;
dans l'econoMiie du benin. ce secteur presente. avec le secteur aaricole. des&#13;
perspectives de croissances importantes. Les activites de commerce et de production&#13;
agricole sont celles qui generent la majonite des emplois peu qualifies et le&#13;
developpement de ces activites jouera donc un r6le important dans la reduction de la&#13;
pauvret. l'amelioration de lFefficacite de l'ensemble des operations de transport est une&#13;
condition indispensable au developpement du commerce et de I'agriculture. Conscient&#13;
de ce fait, le Gouvernement du benin a elabore et presente en octobre 1993 a l'ensemble&#13;
de ses partenaires au developpement sa strategie de transport. Cette strategie a ete&#13;
etablie apres une vaste consultation des differents acteurs publics et prives. Le&#13;
gouvernement du Benin confirme son engagement a mettre progressivement en oeuvre&#13;
cette strategie.&#13;
2. Un des principes fondamnentaux de cette strategie est d'accorder aux differents&#13;
acteurs du secteur des domaines d'intervention dans lesquels ils sont les plus efficaces.&#13;
Ce principe se traduit par une nouvelle repartition des r6les entre les acteurs publics et&#13;
prives. Pour obtenir une repartition optimale, le Gouvernement s'engage a entreprendre&#13;
les reformes decrtes dans la presente et qui reposent sur les principes suivants:&#13;
- I'amrhioration  du  recouvrement des couts   d'usage  de  la route  et&#13;
I'accroissement des ressources de 1'entretien des infrastructures publiques par&#13;
laugmentation de la contribution des usagers&#13;
- ia prise en compte des preoccupations des usagers dans les decisions relatives&#13;
au financement et a la gestion des infrastructures publiques;&#13;
- I'amelioration de lFefficacit6 des efforts financiers en assurant une etroite&#13;
collaboration et l'echange d'information entre toutes les sources potentielles de&#13;
financement (Gouvernement, bailleurs de fonds multilateraux et bilateraux, secteur&#13;
prive, ONG, etc...)&#13;
- 1'etablissement d'un systeme d'indicateurs qui permettra de suivre 1'evolution&#13;
des resultats des reformes et de proceder, si necessaire, a des ajustements;&#13;
- le transfert progressif a des acteurs pnrves de certaines fonctions actuellement&#13;
assumees par l'administration ou des entites publiques et qui constituent un frein au&#13;
developpement harmonieux du secteur.&#13;
- la liberalisation de l'acces contr6le aux professions du secteur, tout en&#13;
garantissant un niveau de performance acceptable ; et&#13;
- arnelioration de la secun'te des biens et des personnes.&#13;

3. Le Gouvernement se propose de poursuivre les reformes entrepnses dans le&#13;
domaine man'time et portuaire depuis 1984, tout en arneliorant les performances des&#13;
diff6rents acteurs publics et prives.&#13;
a) Dans le domaine des transports mantimes. le  Benin prendra les&#13;
dispositions necessaires pour adapter ses procedures de geston des droits de trafic au&#13;
nouvel environnement sous-regional et international. Les procedures et structures&#13;
actuelles en matiere de gestion des droits de trafic seront revues sur cette base. En&#13;
particulier les statuts du CNCB et son fonctionnement devront etre revus pour lui&#13;
permettre de devenir un organe de representation des chargeurs et de promotion de la&#13;
chaine des transports.&#13;
b) Dans le domaine de la gestion portuaire et en vue de remedier aux&#13;
dysfonctionnements actuels des operations portuaires, il sera constitue une veritable&#13;
autorite portuaire qui sera dotee des pouvoirs lw permettant d'assumer cette autorite,&#13;
entrainant de fait une revision des statuts du Port Autonome de Cotonou (PAC). I1 sera&#13;
alors responsable des performances globales du Port et aura autonrte pour prendre les&#13;
mesures necessaires en vue de s'assurer que les divers operateurs respectent les&#13;
objectifs de performance technique auxquels ils seront tenus par contrat. La necessite&#13;
d'une coordination des partenaires de la communaute portuaire appelle la&#13;
redvnamisation du comite de coordination et la mise en place d'un observatoire&#13;
permanent des performances de la chaine portuaire. La manutention des containers et&#13;
la gestion du terre-plein a conteneurs seront confies a une structure privee regroupant a&#13;
son capital 1'ensemble des operateurs interesses notamment les armateurs, les&#13;
transitaires et les manutentionnaires. Les conditions d'acces aux differentes professions&#13;
dans l'espace portuaire seront redefinies pour garantir F'acces a ces professions aux&#13;
seuls operateurs presentant des garanties financieres et techniques suffisantes.&#13;
L'autorite portuaire aura autonte pour contr6ler les performances de tous les operateurs&#13;
et aura autorite pour prendre des mesures en cas de defaillance. Le raccordement de&#13;
tous les services au logiciel de gestion portuaire notanument les acteurs publics&#13;
(CNCB, COBENAM, SOBEMAP et DOUANE) et le fonctionnement correct du&#13;
comite de coordination faciliteront ce contr6le. La creation d'une zone franche de&#13;
stockage et de commercialisation des vehicules d'occasion permettra d'amrliorer les&#13;
perfornances du Port de Cotonou et d'assurer une meilleure securite.&#13;
Secteur Aerien&#13;
Le Benin a decide, dans le cadre de sa strat6gie de developpement, d'engager un&#13;
progranmue de mordernisation, de renforcement et de developpement du secteur aerien&#13;
en particulier la rehabilitation et le developpement des infrastructures et des&#13;
installations terminales de la plate-forme aeroportuaire de Cotonou.&#13;

Secteur ferroviaire&#13;
Le Gouvernement poursuivra sa strategie en matiere de developpement de la&#13;
concurrence intermodale dont l'enjeu est l'amelioration ordonnee du fonctionnement du&#13;
cordor Benin-Niger par l'ouverture du trafic a une concurrence libre et loyale entre le&#13;
rail et la route. Les modalites de cette coordination passent par la mise en place de&#13;
postes de pesage-peage sur l'axe Nord-Sud Cotonou-Parakou et la reorganisation du&#13;
metier de transporteur de marchandise. Les negociations se poursuivront entre les Etats&#13;
du Niger et du Benin en vue de la mise en concurrence libre des transporteurs routiers&#13;
de l'OCBN et de la creation d'une filiale de transport combine rail-route. Les resultats&#13;
de la mise en oeuvre du plan d'entreprise de I'OCBN feront annuellement, l'objet&#13;
d'evaluation.&#13;
Entretien des infrastructures&#13;
Le Gouvemement confirrne sa volonte de placer en premiere pniorite 1'entretien&#13;
des infrastructures de transport pour assurer la conservation et le bon fonctionnement&#13;
des investissements tres importants qu'il a consentis. Pour la mise en oeuvre de cette&#13;
politique, le Gouvernement va mettre en place un programme quinquennal des&#13;
transports. ameliorer les outils d'actualisation de ce programme. et arneliorer les&#13;
procedures de financement et de realisation des programmes d'entretien routier.&#13;
a) un programnme d'investissement et d'entretien de 1'ensemble des&#13;
infrastructures de transport a ete e1abore. II place en premiere prion'te l'entretien&#13;
courant et l'entretien periodique des infrastructures de transports, y compris celles qui&#13;
sont gerees par les structures autonomes. Ce programme ne comprend que des&#13;
investissements dont le taux de rentabilite interne est au moins de 12 %. Ce&#13;
programme sera actualise chaque annee en fonction des besoins resultant de l'evolution&#13;
de la demande et des recentrages eventuels de la strategie de transport. Ce programme&#13;
sera discute avec les bailleurs de fonds du secteur lors de tables rondes qui seront&#13;
organisees au moins tous les deux ans. Le volet transport du programme&#13;
d'investissement public comprendra prion'tairement les projets inscrits dans le&#13;
programme quinquennal.&#13;
b) Le mode de financement de l'entretien routier sera revu pour permettre&#13;
de garantir les fonds necessaires au financement des programmes d'entretien courant&#13;
et periodique. Le Fonds Routier (FR) sera constitue en une structure autonome du type&#13;
Groupement d'lnteret Public (GIP) ou simulaire. Le Fonds Routier financera&#13;
exclusivement les actiVit6s d'entretien routier sur la base des travaux effectivement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
AVVEX A&#13;
realises, le fonctionnement de la structure ainsi constituee, les audits des recettes et des Page 4 of 6&#13;
depenses et une participation aux fTais de fonctionnement partiel des services du&#13;
Ministere des Travaux Publics et des Transports intervenant dans 1'entretien routier, en&#13;
attendant la mise en place, pour ces dernieres, des budgets de fonctionnement&#13;
necessaires aux activites du MTPT dans le domaine de la programmation et du suivi&#13;
des activites d'entretien routier.&#13;
c) Les recettes du Fonds Routier seront constituees essentiellement par&#13;
une dotation du budget general de IrEtat, les reversements par le Tresor des taxes sur&#13;
les carburants et de la taxe de voirie affectees a l'entretien routier par la Loi de&#13;
Finances, des peages routiers dont la collecte sera confide a des operateurs prives dans&#13;
le cadre de contrats de collecte adjuges apres mise en concurrence des candidats&#13;
potentiels. Ia dotation sur le budget general correspondant au quart du montant annuel&#13;
sera versee au debut de chaque trimestre et les versements des recettes collectees par&#13;
le Tresor seront effectues dans un delai maximum de deux mois. Les peages seront&#13;
progressivement generalises sur l'ensemble du reseau bitume pour permettre&#13;
d'augmenter les recettes de sorte que le F R soit en mesure, a terme de 5 ans, de&#13;
financer l'ensemble de 1'entretien courant du reseau a charge du MTPT et en prion'te&#13;
les troncons sur lesquels sont installes des postes de peage ainsi que l'entretien&#13;
mecanise du reseau rural progressivement recupere et 30 % de ltentretien periodique&#13;
des routes en terre de ces deux reseaux. Les recettes du F R seront ensuite&#13;
progressivement augmentees de sorte que le F R soit en mesure, a terme, de financer&#13;
les 70 % de 1'entretien periodique restant dont le financement sera assure en attendant&#13;
par le PIP. I est entendu que le financement de l'entretien periodique des routes&#13;
bitumees continuera d'etre assure par le PIP.&#13;
d)  Des  mecanismes  permettant  d'accroitre  progressivement  la&#13;
parficipation des usagers et des ben6ficiaires au travers de leurs representants habilites&#13;
dans la preparation des programmes d'entretien routier et dans la gestion du F R, seront&#13;
mis en place.&#13;
e) Les travaux d'entretien routier realises en regie seront limites a la&#13;
capacite operationnelle actuelle des equipes soit environ 1 milliard de F CFA par an,&#13;
en regime de croisiere, et seront payes par le F R sur la base des travaux reellement&#13;
executes. Le reste des travaux sera confie aux entreprises privees dans le cadre de&#13;
contrats adjuges apres appels d'offres. L'organisation de la D R 0 A et ses effectifs&#13;
seront revus pour etre adaptes a ce recentrage de ses activites. Un systeme de support-&#13;
fornation des PME locales, qui sera gere par les representants de la profession et, a&#13;
terme entierement finance par les beneficiaires, sera mis en place. Un systeme de&#13;
primes de production et de performance sera mis en place progressivement pour tous&#13;
les agents intervenant dans l'entretien routier. Le Ministere des Finances deleguera au&#13;
MTPT la gestion des marches relatifs a l'entretien routier depuis la procedure&#13;
d'attribution jusqu'a la signature pour les contrats d'un montant inferieur a 1'equivalent&#13;
de 500 Millions CFA. Le MF assurera un contr6le des procedures a posterionr.&#13;
f) La DMTP sera transformee en une societe d'economie mixte de&#13;
location de materiel ou similaire. La nouvelle structure fonctionnera sur des bases&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

purement commerciales dans le respect des regles de concurrence avec les societes&#13;
privees.&#13;
g) Le Gouvernement transferera progressivement la gestion du reseau de&#13;
pistes rurales aux usagers beneficiaires. La politique generale dans ce domaine est&#13;
basee sur les principes suivants: IEtat participera au financement de la rehabilitation&#13;
et de l'entretien du reseau qui n'est pas a charge du MTPT a la condition que ce reseau&#13;
presente un interet conomique demontre et que des partenaires locaux prennent en&#13;
charge la contrepartie aux financements et les depenses d'entretien courant manuel en&#13;
assurant l'execution  prealable  des travaux  objets de  cette  contrepartie; la&#13;
programnmation et la gestion du reseau sera assuree par les partenaires locaux et le&#13;
financement de lEtat assure par le biais de lignes speciales au sein du Fonds Routier&#13;
apres venification de l'eligibilite du programme par un Conseil Technique National&#13;
constitue des differentes entites administratives concernees (MTPT, MDR, MISAT,&#13;
FR) et des representants des partenaires locaux. La strategie de transfert sera adaptee&#13;
au vu des resultats des operations en cours ou a venir et sera ulterieurement applicable&#13;
a toutes les entites publiques impliquees dans la realisation des travaux sur le reseau&#13;
rural dans le cadre de financement sur budget national ou sur financement exterieur.&#13;
Gestion de la circulation et securite routiere&#13;
Afin de garanir une utilisation optimale des  investissements importants&#13;
consentis dans le domaine des infrastructures routieres dans Cotonou, une attention&#13;
toute particuliere sera portee a la gestion de ces infrastructures. En particulier, une&#13;
cellule de gestion de la circulation de Cotonou sera mise en place au sein de la&#13;
Circonscnrption Urbaine de Cotonou pour concevoir et gerer le plan de circulation sur&#13;
['ensemble du reseau urbain. y compn's sur les troncons a charge du MTPT. La&#13;
coordinanon des actions en la matiere sera assuree par un Comite Technique de&#13;
Pilotage comprenant le MTPT, le MEHU, le Commissariat de Cotonou et la C U.&#13;
Conscient des tres lourdes consequences humaines et economique des accidents&#13;
de la circulation, le Gouvernement compte renforcer de fa,on importante le Centre&#13;
National de securite Routiere pour lui permettre de renforcer son r6le de contr6le et&#13;
d'information en faveur d'une reduction des accidents de la route. Ce renforcement&#13;
permettra de mettre en oeuvre un programme de travaux d'elimination des "points&#13;
noirs" sur le reseau prioritaire.&#13;

COMPONENT C: RURAL ROAD REHABILITATION&#13;
AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
Description&#13;
21.    The component comprises two elements: (a) a pilot program of works to&#13;
improve and extend the rural road network, and (b) preparation of a strategy to&#13;
manage and finance rural roads, plus support to DROA and to the rural communities&#13;
in the implementation of the pilot works and maintenance operation, leading to an&#13;
approach which can be extended to cover the entire rural road network.&#13;
22.    Subcomponent C-1: Rural Road Works (Part Cl of the Credit). A pilot&#13;
program of works to rehabilitation and improve about 300 km of non-classified rural&#13;
roads would be carried out under DROA's supervision, in close collaboration with the&#13;
local communities in three areas already identified (Cobly, Adjohoun and Banikoara),&#13;
plus three more areas to be identified during program implementation.&#13;
Implementation of this program will lead to finalization of a sound strategy for rural&#13;
road maintenance which combines Government support and local community&#13;
management.&#13;
23.    Subcomponent C-2: Rural Road Management (Part C2 of the Credit).&#13;
The purpose of this component is to help DROA and the local communities work out&#13;
the best collaborative arrangements for implementing the pilot works program, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX C&#13;
Page 11 of 16&#13;
for a sustainable national rural roads management strategy, including maintenance. It&#13;
comprises technical assistance, studies and training. DROA would receive&#13;
(a)   short-term assistance to set up and progressively extend, procedures&#13;
for programming, managing and financing rural roads, designed to&#13;
support the new collaborative approach, and tested under the pilot rural&#13;
road improvement program (7.5 months of international consultants, 5&#13;
months of local consultants).&#13;
Local community partners in the six areas selected for the pilot operation would&#13;
receive a program of assistance prepared by NGOs and consultants:&#13;
(b)   at the outset, to ensure that all groups interested in the rural road&#13;
program in the six pilot areas are adequately briefed and given access&#13;
to information about the program, that they are coached through the&#13;
steps required to form a legally recognized entity for program&#13;
participation purposes, and that they are given the assistance they need&#13;
to prepare rural road programs eligible for Government financing; and,&#13;
once financing has been approved for rehabilitation of rural roads&#13;
under the pilot, to guide them in carrying out the works which will&#13;
constitute their counterpart contribution, and in setting up procedures&#13;
and methods for carrying out agreed road maintenance programs (96&#13;
months of international NGOs, 144 months of local NGOs, 54 months&#13;
of consultants, and NGO operating costs).&#13;
Implementation&#13;
24.   MTPT will implement this component through DROA, in close collaboration&#13;
with local community partners responsible for programming and phasing of works on&#13;
the roads in their areas, with the assistance of an international NGO and a specialized&#13;
consulting firm, and within the framework for coordination of rural road maintenance&#13;
called the National Technical Council (Conseil techniqzue national or CTN). The&#13;
procedures for identifying, programming and carrying out maintenance on rural roads&#13;
will be recorded in a procedural manual subject to IDA's approval&#13;
25.   An international NGO with successful experience in dealing with civil works&#13;
in rural areas and in advising and coaching rural communities will be hired under the&#13;
program following evaluation of at least three NGO candidates acceptable to IDA.&#13;
The international NGO selected will be required to define its methodology for&#13;
achieving the desired objectives, identify local NGOs capable of acting as local&#13;
counterparts and intermediaries, make sure the local NGOs receive necessary training,&#13;
and support them through the setup stage of the pilot operation. The contract with&#13;
NGOs will include the cost of equipment and overhead for carrying out program&#13;
support. A consulting firm with a good track record in rural road rehabilitation and&#13;
labor-intensive civil works will be recruited to assist DROA in the definition of&#13;
technical standards and techniques for carrying out and supervising rural road&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX C&#13;
Page 12 of 16&#13;
rehabilitation and maintenance works. The consultant will be selected after evaluating&#13;
at least three local consulting firms who are supported by experienced international&#13;
consultants.&#13;
26.   DROA will provide administrative support (secretariat) for CTN. Works to be&#13;
carried out by the local partners will be carried out entirely at their initiative and&#13;
under their responsibility. In this effort, the local partners will receive support as&#13;
needed from the NGOs and specialized consultant financed under the program.&#13;
DROA will supervise the works carried out by local partners in order to ascertain that&#13;
the terms of the agreement with them have been respected.&#13;
27.   Participation of local communities in rural road rehabilitation and&#13;
maintenance works during the program period will be a condition of implementation&#13;
of this component. The nature and degree of local participation will be defined during&#13;
the preparation of works and maintenance programs. Under no condition will this&#13;
local participation be less than that required to ensure: (a) routine manual&#13;
maintenance of the local network which has been rehabilitated with Government&#13;
funds, and (b) execution of manual works required to prepare for rehabilitation.&#13;
28.   Government counterpart funds will be financed by the National Budget.&#13;
Funds will be made available by the National Treasure in the Project Account opened&#13;
by the Road Fund (see paragraph 19 above).&#13;
29.   Tables C-5 and C-6 show a summary of the technical assistance, training and&#13;
equipment and a preliminary expenditure plan for this component. Further details&#13;
regarding implementation are provided in the Program Implementation Manual&#13;
(PIM) drafted during the program's preparation and finalized at negotiation.&#13;
The PIM includes annexes defining: (a) detailed procurement procedures; (b)&#13;
accounting procedures related to this component; (c) list of performance indicators;&#13;
(d) draft terms of references for technical assistance and NGOs' involvement under&#13;
this component; (e) draft elligibility criteria for the selection of local partners and of&#13;
works included in the programs; and (f) draft procudures for CTN operation and&#13;
functioning.&#13;

implementation of a management system for Cotonou's bus and truck stations (gares&#13;
routieres).&#13;
31.   Subcomponent D-1: Traffic Improvement Works (Parts Dl and D2 of the&#13;
Credit). The works proposed for financing under the proposed program correspond&#13;
to the priority tranche of works in the traffic and bus/truck station improvement&#13;
program. The exact contents of this program will be determined by the traffic and&#13;
bus/truck station studies to be prepared with program financing. On the basis of&#13;
preliminary studies started under the ongoing urban program and to be completed&#13;
during program implementation, these works would include: (a) improvement of ten&#13;
(10) intersections located along the main primary roads, of which six will be equipped&#13;
with traffic lights; (b) construction of an initial network of cycleways (about 11 km)&#13;
along the most heavily traveled primary roadways between Godome and Sobebra; and&#13;
(c) renovation of the three main bus/truck stations, whose management would be&#13;
handed over to private operators under a concession agreement.&#13;
32.   Subcomponent D-2: Support to Build Local Capacity for Urban Traffic&#13;
and Parking Management (Parts D3 and D4 of the Credit). The proposed program&#13;
would finance:&#13;
(a)   support for the creation of an urban traffic management unit (Cellule&#13;
de circulation or CC) to handle traffic and parking management for the&#13;
city of Cotonou, including the preparation and implementation of a&#13;
first traffic plan, and management of parking and of bus/truck stations;&#13;
(b)   a program of assistance/advisory/training for the traffic unit to support:&#13;
(i) preparation and implementation of the traffic plan; and (ii)&#13;
preparation of a study covering the management and renovation of&#13;
main bus/truck stations in Cotonou. The program would also finance&#13;
preliminary engineering for the priority slice of works to improve&#13;
traffic and renovate the stations;&#13;
(c)   assistance to define and set up a procedure for consulting with urban&#13;
road and transport users in order to facilitate the implementation of the&#13;
urban traffic plan and promote road user safety measures (through a&#13;
local NGO with community participation);&#13;
(d)   equipment and office furniture for the startup of the traffic unit.&#13;
Implementation&#13;
33.   DROA will implement this component using AGETUR to be hired under a&#13;
management agreement for management of small works. MTPT will sign an&#13;
assistance agreement (convention d 'assistance) with SERHAU-SEM covering&#13;
monitoring and coordination of: (a) the setup and management of the traffic unit for a&#13;
period not to exceed two years, sufficient to complete the study for a traffic and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX C&#13;

bus/road station management plan; and (b) support to the traffic unit (CC) in the&#13;
preparation of this plan. DROA will be responsible for engineering studies, works&#13;
procurement and supervision, and traffic light equipment purchase required for works&#13;
to implement the traffic plan under subcomponent D-1. MTPT will sign a separate&#13;
management agreement with AGETUR covering engineering and works to construct&#13;
cycleways, to renovate three bus/truck stations (b and c of subcomponent D- I), and to&#13;
make minor traffic improvement on primary roadways.&#13;
34.   The traffic management unit (CC) will receive technical support at startup for&#13;
the purpose of: (a) training for its own staff and for staff selected from other public&#13;
and private entities to develop local expertise in urban traffic engineering and&#13;
management; (b) assisting CC with the preparation of a study to produce a traffic&#13;
structure plan; (c) assisting CC with the preparation of a study to produce an action&#13;
plan for the management and renovation of bus/truck stations, which the City would&#13;
then be able to implement, and which would increase income earned by these stations&#13;
through private concession arrangements. This up front assistance would be followed&#13;
up by short-term consultant visits on demand of the CC head.&#13;
35.   Traffic signalization equipment (traffic lights) to be procured under the&#13;
proposed program for installation on the primary network will become the property of&#13;
the city once the equipment has been approved and commissioned, and the city will&#13;
manage and maintain it. Updating signal synchronization patterns will be the&#13;
responsibility of the traffic unit (CC).&#13;
36.   Government counterpart will be financed by National Budget through two&#13;
project accounts opened by both AGETUR and the Road Fund (see paragraph 19&#13;
above). National Treasure will deposit the necessary funds in these accounts.&#13;
37.   Tables C-7 and C-8 show a summary of the technical assistance, training and&#13;
equipment and a preliminary expenditure plan for this component. Further details on&#13;
implementation are provided in the Program Implementation Manual (PIM)&#13;
drafted during program preparation and finalized at negotiation. The PIM&#13;
includes annexes defining: (a) detailed procurement procedures; (b) accounting&#13;
procedures related to this component; (c) list of performance indicators; (d) draft&#13;
terms of references for technical assistance, NGOs and SERHAU support; (e)&#13;
functioning procedures for traffic management unit and CTP, and for the preparation&#13;
of the works program; and (f) draft convention between MTPT and AGETUR.&#13;

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT&#13;
1.    An assessment of the environmental impact of the program was carried out&#13;
during program implementation, based on field visits of the road networks (3,800 km&#13;
of roads in all ecological areas of the country), consultations with rural and urban&#13;
residents affected by road rehabilitation initiatives, and contacts with key administrative&#13;
bodies. Negative impacts which road works might have were defined, and guidelines&#13;
were prepared which would apply to all works in the program. Guidelines define&#13;
either measures for limiting negative impacts which were identified, or methods for&#13;
assessing such negative impacts and defining an appropriate response where&#13;
conditions are more complex. These guidelines have been prepared within the&#13;
framework of the National Environmental Plan (NEP), and are designed to facilitate&#13;
consistent action by all entities involved in program implementation.&#13;
2.    Since no new roads will be opened up under this program, the expected&#13;
environmental impacts will be milder than in the case of new roads. In addition, the&#13;
program will encourage labor-intensive road maintenance activities, which are&#13;
generally more environmentally friendly than highly mechanized activities. On&#13;
interurban road sections, potential environmental impacts and the accompanying&#13;
mitigation measures are as follows:&#13;
(a)   Laterite quarries that are opened up along the roads to obtain road&#13;
surfacing materials, if not rehabilitated after use, could induce erosion&#13;
and stagnating waters. Roughly 300,000 m3 of materials are extracted&#13;
annually from about 70 such sites, covering a total of about 30 ha. The&#13;
rehabilitation of these areas is technically straightforward and easily&#13;
carried out. Environmental guidelines require the restoration of such&#13;
quarries by restoring the sites or transforming them into water&#13;
reservoirs that may greatly benefit local residents.&#13;
(b)   Wetlands may be harmed by road crossing, particularly when road&#13;
drainage infrastructure is ineffective. This may lead to an imbalance of&#13;
fragile ecosystems, loss of agricultural land used during dry seasons,&#13;
and eutrophication of certain water bodies. The five-year priority&#13;
transport program includes repair and maintenance of all drainage&#13;
works (around 3000), which will result in the restoration of the&#13;
original water transfers upstream and downstream that naturally&#13;
regulate wetlands.&#13;
(c)   The drainage of roads (runoff waters) sometimes leads to the&#13;
accelerated formation of gullies and to erosion alongside the roads. It&#13;
has generally been observed that existing drainage infrastructure&#13;
carries water to areas with adequate vegetative cover and that erosion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEXD&#13;
Page 2 of 2&#13;
is generally not exacerbated by road drainage. In cases where a&#13;
problem is seen to occur, the guidelines include provisions for&#13;
improving the downstream portion of road drainage systems..&#13;
(d)   Atmospheric pollution linked to road rehabilitation and maintenance is&#13;
very low and negligible compared to other sources of air pollution&#13;
such as general passenger and freight vehicle traffic. The main&#13;
problem at present is the dust generated by major rehabilitation works,&#13;
which is easily controlled by frequent watering of construction sites, a&#13;
method already widely practiced by road construction companies.&#13;
(e)    The destruction of human habitat is rarely a problem. In the few cases&#13;
where households had to be evicted because of road works.&#13;
compensation measures were deemed acceptable by residents, who&#13;
were able to relocate easily within their original community. In any&#13;
case, displacement of residents will not take place under this program.&#13;
3.    In the framework of the implementation of the NEP, Benin has recently&#13;
created a National Environmental Agency and prepared an environmental law that&#13;
includes requirements for environmental impact assessments, for sectoral&#13;
environmental guidelines and institutional coordination. In this respect, the program&#13;
will be a leader, since it will propose the first set of sectoral environmental guidelines&#13;
developed in Benin.&#13;
4.    The guidelines include a conceptual framework for undertaking the necessary&#13;
environmental impact assessments and the corresponding mitigation plans related to&#13;
future road rehabilitation and maintenance works. Environmental requirements will&#13;
be incorporated into the technical specifications of works contracts.&#13;
5.    In urban and peri-urban zones, potential environmental impacts and mitigation&#13;
measures are as follows:&#13;
(a)    The limited infiltration surface that characterizes urban areas increases&#13;
the risks of flooding. Traffic improvement works under the program&#13;
will be designed with adequate attention to the provision of proper&#13;
drainage infrastructure.&#13;
(b)   Atmospheric pollution issues are more serious in urban areas due to&#13;
the density of traffic, the large numbers of people affected, and the&#13;
limited airflow that characterizes urban areas. Even more care is&#13;
generally taken by road construction companies than outside the cities&#13;
in order to minimize dust displacement.&#13;
(c)    Habitat destruction and relocation of city dwellers will generally be&#13;
avoided in the program. Past experience in Benin has shown that when&#13;
dwellings have to be destroyed, the levels of compensation are realistic&#13;
and generally satisfactory to evicted households.&#13;

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
PORT COMPONENT AND ROAD COMPONENT&#13;
This annex summar izes the results ol' the economic analysis for the work included in the port&#13;
component A and for all works included in the priority road program, with detailed justification for&#13;
works on the earth network which are proposed for IDA financing. Details of the economic analysis&#13;
are in the Program files. At the end of the annex, there is a listing of all road works included in the&#13;
priority program as of July 1995, including traffic, length, costs, internal rate of return where&#13;
available, donor financing, and year in program (see Table E- 10) 'IThe phasing and financing of the&#13;
priority program for all subsectors. and the selection of elements for proposed IDA financing are&#13;
presented in the SAR, Chapter 3 (paras. 3.3 and 3.6). The economic justification for proposed IDA&#13;
components C and D is presented in the SAR. Chapter 4 (paras. 4.5 and 4.6).&#13;
PORT COMPONENT&#13;
(COMPONENT A)&#13;
1.     Methodology for Economic Justification. Under the present operating&#13;
conditions, the port of Cotonou should reach its saturation level (70 percent of the&#13;
quays occupation rate) at 2'.2'5 million tons in 1998, based on a realistic growth&#13;
scenario. The port component of the Project includes implementing reforms necessary&#13;
to allow efficient use of infrastructure to achieve higher productivity levels similar to&#13;
those of neighboring ports. If these performance objectives are reached, the capacity&#13;
of the port of Cotonou would increase to 2.6 million tons port traffic in 2001,&#13;
assuming a growth rate of traffic or capacity of 4 percent per year. Past experience&#13;
has shown that in the case of congestion in the port of Cotonou, maritime companies&#13;
use the port of Lome as an alternative rather than putting up with long waiting times.&#13;
The basic assumption used for the economic justification corresponds to the&#13;
saturation of the port of Cotonou in 1998 at 2.25 million tons and the second&#13;
assumption includes the proposed Project with 2.6 million tons in 2001. The&#13;
quantified benefits of the Project include: (a) savings on transport costs for&#13;
merchandise by road from Lome to Cotonou . (b) avoidance of the economic loss&#13;
resulting from the loss of revenues by Beninese public and private port operators; and&#13;
(c) savings on traffic and maintenance costs for port handling operations.&#13;
2.     Savings on Transport Costs for Merchandise by Road from Lome to&#13;
Cotonou. The total economic cost for the transport of merchandise by road, from&#13;
Lome to Cotonou between 1998 and 2001, is evaluated at 879 million CFA franc&#13;
(1995 terms with a 12 percent discount rate). Distance for the said transport is 150&#13;
km; transport is done by 25-ton trucks; 50 percent of the merchandise transferred to&#13;
Lome will be returned to Cotonou by road; economic cost for operating a 25-ton truck&#13;
is estimated at 500 CFA franc per kmi with an empty return to Lome assumed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
A NNEX E&#13;
Page 2 of 16&#13;
3.    Savings on the Loss of Revenues by Beninese Port Operators. The&#13;
economic loss of the transfer of 942,000 tons of merchandise to Lome, between 1998&#13;
and 2001, is estimated at 3,357 million CFA franc (1995 terms with a 12 percent&#13;
discount rate). The assumptions used for this calculation are. as follows: PAC gross&#13;
margin during the period is estimated at 5,569 million CFA franc; SOBEMAP gross&#13;
margin during the period is estimated at 5,600 million CFA franc; and total gross&#13;
margin per ton of merchandise is estimated at 5.73 CFA franc. or 2.86 CFA franc for&#13;
PAC and 2.87 CFA franc for SOBEMAP. On this basis losses of gross margin for&#13;
PAC and SOBEMAP from 1998 to 2001 total 3,358 million CFA franc. Loss in gross&#13;
margin of private operators is unknown and has not been included in the analysis.&#13;
4.    Savings of Traffic and Maintenance Costs for Port Handling Operations.&#13;
The total amount of traffic cost savings within the port facilities, between 1998 and&#13;
2001, is estimated at 670 million CFA franc (1995 terms with a 12 percent discount&#13;
rate). This amount is made up of the following: 594 million CFA franc for the&#13;
maintenance of port handling equipment and 76 million CFA franc for improving&#13;
road infrastructure within the port. The assumptions used are as follows:&#13;
rehabilitation of quay edges; reorganization of port area; and improvement of port&#13;
operations management. These are estimated to lead to a 17 percent reduction in&#13;
operating costs for vehicles and port handling equipment.&#13;
5.    Economic Analysis and Sensitivity Analysis For the economic analysis,&#13;
three cases have been considered: (a) the base case using the above assumptions; (b) a&#13;
case with a reduced port traffic growth rate; and (c) a case with a reduced productivity&#13;
increase. Based on the above quantified benefits, the economic rate of return for the&#13;
base case is estimated at 250 percent. This economic calculation takes into account&#13;
the flow of investment expenses and benefits up to 2001, given in Table E-1. The net&#13;
present value of the investments in 1995 terms with a 12 percent discount rate is&#13;
estimated at 3,914 million CFA franc. If port traffic grows at 3 percent rather than 4.5&#13;
percent assumed in the base case, the ERR falls to 12 percent and the net present&#13;
value to 0. If productivity were only half of that assumed for the base case, port&#13;
capacity would be limited to 2.45 million tons leading to the congestion of the port at&#13;
the end of 1999 instead of end 2001. Under this assumption, the economic rate of&#13;
return would be reduced to 36 percent instead of 250 percent. Table E- I gives the&#13;
assumptions and the results of the economic analysis for each case, and Table E-2&#13;
gives the flow of investment expenses and benefits in the base case.&#13;

FIVE-YEAR PRIORITY ROAD PROGRAM&#13;
(COMPONENT B)&#13;
PAVED ROADS&#13;
Construction and Rehabilitation&#13;
6.     Paved road works included in the five-year priority program fall into two&#13;
categories: (a) new works (see heading 1.1 in Table E-7 at end of annex), involving&#13;
(i) paving of existing interurban earth road sections, plus additional lanes for the&#13;
Cotonou-Porto Novo highway, (ii) interurban road safety works at high accident&#13;
locations, (iii) new urban highways in Cotonou, and (iv) urban traffic improvement&#13;
works in Cotonou; and (b) rehabilitation of badly deteriorated sections of the paved&#13;
interurban network (see heading 1.2). Cost benefit analyses for new paving and&#13;
rehabilitation (a-i and b) were carried out by consultants financed by other donors,&#13;
using HDM. New urban highway construction (a-iii) was analyzed by consultants&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX E&#13;
Page 4 of 16&#13;
financed by other donors using the VOC module from HDM, along with other&#13;
economic models tailored to urban conditions. Economic analysis of works under the&#13;
two categories proposed for IDA financing, safety works (a-ii) and urban road works&#13;
(a-iv), will be carried out during program implementation to finalize specific works to&#13;
be carried out, following further study of high accident spots and preparation of a&#13;
traffic plan for Cotonou.&#13;
7.    All traffic and vehicle operating cost data used by consultants was provided by&#13;
BGR or worked out in consultation with them; the estimates are considered sound.&#13;
Analyses carried out during the 1992 preparation of the initial priority program for&#13;
paved roads were adjusted for the 1994 devaluation. Construction design and costs for&#13;
paved road works were based on technical standards for pavements developed during&#13;
the strategy preparation. Double surface treatments, commonly used in the past, are to&#13;
be avoided in favor of cement-asphalt base and sand-asphalt surfacing, which offer&#13;
the triple advantage of (a) lower cost, (b) lower maintenance requirements, (c) use of&#13;
local materials (lower foreign exchange requirement). The results of the economic&#13;
analysis of paved road construction and rehabilitation are shown in Table E- I1&#13;
8.    Three sections of earth roads to be paved are included in the priority program&#13;
at Government's insistence despite their ERR. Of these, one I I -km section&#13;
(Natitingou-Porga) is required to complete the paved western route from Parakou to&#13;
Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso). Two other sections totalling over 200 km (Savalou-&#13;
Djougou-Ouake) would create an alternative paved itinerary for Cotonou-&#13;
Ouagadougou. branching off further south than Parakou. Since traffic levels are not&#13;
currently expected to justify these investments during the 1995-2000 period, they&#13;
were left in the program at the lowest priority level, including only a quarter of their&#13;
costs. Incorporation of these investments in their totality will be reconsidered at such&#13;
time as their economic justification can be established and after completing other&#13;
higher priority investments, including all periodic maintenance.&#13;
Maintenance&#13;
9.    Periodic maintenance alternatives for paved roads (see heading 1.3) were&#13;
analyzed by BGR staff with support from short-term consultants financed by IDA,&#13;
using HDM. Operating cost functions for each of seven vehicle types were calculated&#13;
directly by the HDM, whose VOC module incorporates variations in VOC elements&#13;
according to road conditions as defined by roughness coefficients (IRI). Cost-benefit&#13;
analysis compares an annual maintenance cost stream to a stream of benefits in the&#13;
form of road user savings due to improved road conditions over the base case&#13;
situation. A base case of routine maintenance only was compared with three periodic&#13;
maintenance alternatives initially defined for analysis: (a) a base case of shoulder&#13;
maintenance (cantonnage) only (ALTO); (b) shoulder maintenance plus surface&#13;
patching (point a temps) (ALT1); (c) shoulder maintenance plus periodic surface&#13;
sealing treatment, once 30 percent of road surface is lost to cracks, potholes or&#13;
stripping (ALT2); and (d) shoulder maintenance plus cement-asphalt or sand-asphalt&#13;
treatment, once the IRI reaches the value of 5 (difficult passage during rainy season)&#13;
(ALT3). Analysis showed on the last two choices as the most economic ones.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX E&#13;
Page 5 of 16&#13;
10.   Of the itineraries included in the priority periodic maintenance program,&#13;
four have an ERR &lt; 12. The ERR of the best alternative for each itinerary is given in&#13;
Table E- I 1. Two itineraries (Dassa-Savalou and Bohicon-Parakou) despite their ERR&#13;
below 12%, have been included in the priority program because of the extreme&#13;
fragility of these road surfaces. The reasons for this are as follows: First, the ERRs are&#13;
misleading because HDM does not reflect the rapid degradation of fragile road&#13;
pavements, such as those with granular bases and water-permeable surface treatments&#13;
on a clay foundation, typical of Benin. Second, when in fact such roads are not&#13;
maintained, they deteriorate catastrophically, once the first potholes appear. Third,&#13;
immediate investment in periodic maintenance is an economic alternative to waiting&#13;
for the road surfaces to fail and then rebuilding them. Last but not least, the above&#13;
economic analysis was carried out assuming a 1995 startup date for these works,&#13;
when in fact financing has yet to be identified for 80 percent of them are shown in&#13;
Table 1.3 of SAR. Since it is more than likely that they will not in fact start up until&#13;
1997, it is most likely that by that time, surfaces will have deteriorated to a point&#13;
where ERRs will be at least 12 percent by then. The fact is that periodic maintenance&#13;
is a necessary component of any economically viable long-term road investment&#13;
strategy, whether or not the HDM results indicate it in this specific case. Government&#13;
has recognized this necessity by giving periodic maintenance first priority in the road&#13;
program, regardless of the low ERRs.&#13;
EARTH ROADS&#13;
Methodology&#13;
11.   An optimal maintenance strategy for the unpaved road network was designed&#13;
using a locally tailored approach, based on generalizing from empirical evidence of&#13;
road deterioration at given traffic and maintenance levels, based on maintenance&#13;
experience and observations of earth road conditions in Benin and neighboring&#13;
countries over the last few years. For example, regravelling frequencies for periodic&#13;
maintenance were defined based on local experience with different traffic and service&#13;
levels. The main objective was to optimize the allocation of road maintenance&#13;
resources, in order to maximize the number of itineraries that are practicable. Thus&#13;
maintenance activities must be tailored to the traffic levels, terrain and slope, and&#13;
weather conditions obtaining for each section to be maintained, if service levels are to&#13;
optimize the overall balance between user cost savings and maintenance costs. The&#13;
optimal maintenance strategy is that which minimizes the present value of the net cost&#13;
of maintenance, with net cost on a given section defined as the difference between the&#13;
cost of routine plus periodic maintenance activities, and the user cost savings for&#13;
vehicles using the road section; the present value of the annual stream of net costs is&#13;
calculated using a country discount rate of 12%.&#13;
Cost Data&#13;
12.   Vehicle Operating Costs. Base operating cost functions for each of seven&#13;
vehicle types calculated by the HDM were adjusted using visually determined&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX E&#13;
Page 6 of 16&#13;
roughness coefficients (see Program Implementation Manual (PIM)for details).&#13;
Operating cost data collected during the 1992 strategy preparation reflect the impact&#13;
of the 1994 CFA franc devaluation, with correction coefficients ranging from 1.3 for&#13;
labor to 1.8 for vehicle purchase and tire costs. Fuel was shadow-priced at CFA franc&#13;
120 per liter for gas-oil and CFA franc 140 for gasoline (Government fixed pump&#13;
price in Benin, CFA franc 165), taking into account widespread use of fraudulently&#13;
imported fuel.&#13;
13.   Cost of Works. All costs are based on private contract execution (not force&#13;
account). Cost of works were calculated net of direct and indirect taxes as of April&#13;
1995. Total works costs include preliminary and final engineering, works,&#13;
supervision, and physical contingencies. Data used are those collected during&#13;
preparation of the strategy report in 1992 and thereafter from contracts awarded. Data&#13;
from contracts awarded before January 1994 were corrected to reflect the impact of&#13;
the devaluation of the CFA franc. The economic cost of periodic maintenance&#13;
includes all necessary works to prepare road surfaces, that is, regravelling (15 cm)&#13;
plus the initial grading of the roadbed, total cost of which is estimated at CFA franc&#13;
4,750 per cubic meter.&#13;
Optimal Maintenance Strategy&#13;
14.   The steps involved in defining an optimal maintenance policy for the national&#13;
earth road network are to determine: (a) the desired average service level to be&#13;
maintained between periodic maintenance activities; (b) the sequence of routine and&#13;
periodic maintenance activities; and (c) the frequencies of these activities. These steps&#13;
are summarized below, with details available in the PIM.&#13;
15.   Definition of Service Levels on Maintainable Earth Roads. Five service&#13;
levels ranging from excellent to very poor were identified, each of which corresponds&#13;
to a road condition as described by a measurable indicator, in this case, roughness.&#13;
The five service levels (niveau de service or NS) and the corresponding roughness&#13;
values are as follows: NS5, excellent (IRI = 4 to 6); NS4, good (IRI = 6 to 10); NS3,&#13;
fair (IRI = 10 to 16); NS2, poor (IRI = 16 to 20); NS1, very poor (IRI = 20 to 24). The&#13;
current service level of each earth road section was assessed during program&#13;
preparation using BGR methods based on a pragmatic field approach developed by&#13;
OECD. The known functional relationship between service level and vehicle&#13;
operating costs, as established by HDM, then also gives the relationship between IRI&#13;
and VOC. Roads rated at IRI &gt; 24 are considered impassable and are dealt with under&#13;
the trouble spots category.&#13;
16.   Impact of Maintenance on Service Level. Maintenance of earth roads&#13;
includes: (a) tasks which do not vary with service levels, that is, manual routine&#13;
shoulder and drain clearing (cantonnage); and (b) tasks which have an impact on&#13;
service levels, such as routine patching (point a temps) and periodic regravelling.&#13;
Rainfall has an impact on manual routine maintenance needs, and soil sensitivity to&#13;
water has an impact on regravelling needs. Data accumulated during regular network&#13;
inspections over the last few years has led to the definition of the impact on earth road&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX E&#13;
Page 7 of 16&#13;
roughness, and hence on service levels, of periodic gravelling and of different routine&#13;
maintenance approaches at different traffic levels, during the intervals between&#13;
periodic regravelling. The results are shown in Table E-5 (minimum routine&#13;
maintenance requirements to hold a given service level). and Table E-6 ( minimum&#13;
frequency of regravelling in years required to hold a given service level over a longer&#13;
period of time).&#13;
17.   Optimizing net maintenance cost. For each traffic level, the most economic&#13;
service level to maintain has been determined. For each traffic level, a curve is&#13;
generated of overall economic cost per km (net present value of VOC plus&#13;
maintenance cost, over 15 years at 12 percent) as a function of road maintenance&#13;
costs, at each service level (see Graph E-12). The graph shows an example of results&#13;
based on truck/car modal split of 10/90 and one on 30/70. The resulting determination&#13;
of optimal maintenance activities by traffic, service levels, and modal split is shown&#13;
in Table E-7. In the short to medium term, service level 4 (good) will be the highest&#13;
service level on the most heavily traveled earth roads. Using the service&#13;
level/maintenance activities relationship developed in the preceding paragraphs, total&#13;
maintenance costs were estimated for the entire earth network. Total estimated annual&#13;
routine and periodic maintenance program costs are shown in Tables H-8 and H-9.&#13;
The total annual cost of an economically optimal earth road maintenance program on&#13;
all 2,066 km of the MTPT earth network is about CFA franc 9.3 billion for periodic&#13;
maintenance during the next five years and CFA franc 1.6 billion per year for routine&#13;
maintenance..&#13;
Elimination of Trouble Spots and Drainage Repairs&#13;
18.   Spot Improvement on Trouble Spots (points critiques). The nature of the&#13;
national earth road network requires that all sections be passable at all times of year.&#13;
Network structure is such that reasonable alternative routings or detours simply do&#13;
not exist for 20 of the 57 sectio is, equivalent to 26 percent of the total network&#13;
length. The remaining sectors either carry more than 40v/d or do not have reasonable&#13;
alternative detours and serve sous-prefectures. From an economic point of view,&#13;
breakdowns on these priority roads have an adverse impact on agricultural production&#13;
and trade. On 28 sections, representing around 50 percent of the existing network,&#13;
traffic is currently slowed or blocked either year-round or during the rains, due to at&#13;
least one trouble spot per section, that is, a muddy section due either to poor soil&#13;
quality or to a drainage structure problem. The severity of trouble spots has been&#13;
categorized by degree of passability (niveau de praticabilite or NP): (1) permanently&#13;
blocked; (2) blocked during rainy season, difficult rest of year; (3) blocked during&#13;
rainy season, passable rest of year; (4) difficult passage; (5) difficult passage during&#13;
rainy season; and (6) smooth passage. For the entire network to be passable to an&#13;
acceptable degree, trouble spots in categories (1), (2), and (3) must be eliminated. The&#13;
priority program includes all 28 trouble spot sections (see heading 2.1), and all of&#13;
these are included in the proposed IDA program.&#13;
19.   Bridge and Drainage Repairs (ouvrages d'art et hydrauliques). There are&#13;
around 600 bridges or drainage structures requiring repair on 54 sections of the earth&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX E&#13;
Page 8 of 16&#13;
network (60 percent of network lengtlh), ranging from minor repair to complete&#13;
reconstruction. This category of works helps prevent future trouble spots, as the&#13;
sections involved remain fairly passable (NP 4 to 6); all sections requiring such&#13;
repairs with serious problems (NP I to 3) were included in the trouble spots category.&#13;
If these additional works are not carried out, the spots in question will without any&#13;
doubt become the trouble spots of the future. Of the 54 sections, 21 are the nearest to&#13;
becoming critical and are programmed for 1996-98. and repairs on these sections are&#13;
therefore included in the proposed IDA program, along with financing for all of the&#13;
trouble spots.&#13;
20.    Economic Justification. - Base Case and Sensitivity. ERR of all&#13;
rehabilitation works included in the priority program (elimination of trouble spots and&#13;
rehabilitation of drainage structures) as well as routine and periodic maintenance have&#13;
been calculated for each road sections and three cases: (a) base case with road&#13;
maintenance corresponding to the optimum as defined above and assuming that the&#13;
traffic on the road sections which are currently affected by major trouble spots will&#13;
increase to 48 v/d after rehabilitation; (b) a case where the maintenance would be the&#13;
same as in the base case, but the traffic will increase to only by half (25 v/d) on the&#13;
sections in very poor condition; and (c) a case where road maintenance resources will&#13;
remain at the same level as in 1994 (CFA franc 1.7 billion per year compared to 2.7&#13;
billion in the base case). Investment in each case with program include the execution&#13;
of works of the three above for spot improvement, rehabilitation of drainage structure&#13;
and periodic maintenance.&#13;
21.    Situation without Project. Assumptions for the evolution of the network&#13;
without Project have been used for the economic justification with respect to the&#13;
expenses on earth roads, and are detailed below. In the scenario without Project, no&#13;
investment would be made. Only the manual maintenance will be carried out to&#13;
maintain basic traffic on the network despite a rapid and sustained degradation of the&#13;
level of service and road blockages. The levels of service and their evolution, in the&#13;
scenario with no Project, are presented in Table E-3.&#13;

22.   It has been accepted that the evolution of the levels of degradation listed&#13;
above are valid for a percentage of 20% of heavy trucks. The time lag to reach the&#13;
levels LSI has also been modified as presented above, in a linear fashion between the&#13;
following extremities: 20% reduction in the values of the time lag for 10% of heavy&#13;
trucks and a 20% increase in the values for 30% of heavy trucks.&#13;
23.   Economic Rate of Return in the Base Case. The assumptions and the results&#13;
of the economic analysis of the program for each of the three above cases are&#13;
summarized in Table E-10. The results of the economic analysis for each itinerary&#13;
and for the above three scenarios are given in Table-E-4 and summarized below.&#13;
This table presents the length and traffic for each of the 61 road sections: (a) the cost&#13;
of investment and periodic maintenance; (b) the present costs (12 percent discount&#13;
rate) for elimination of trouble spots and rehabilitation of drainage structures; (c) the&#13;
benefits resulting from the execution of works, which are savings on traffic costs,&#13;
deducted routine maintenance costs compared to the solution without Project; (d) the&#13;
net present value for the base case; and (e) the internal rate of return of the two&#13;
sensitivity cases. The economic analysis for the base case shows the following: (a) the&#13;
maintenance strategy resulting from optimizing the above, presents a high global&#13;
economic returm; (b) 6 itineraries present an internal rate of return inferior to 12&#13;
percent. However, knowing thiat 5 out of these do not offer any alternative itinerary, a&#13;
return has been computed on these sections reducing works to those necessary to&#13;
enable traffic all year around but with difficult passages. In this case, only one&#13;
section. (Datori-Cobli) presents an economic return inferior to 12 percent. Sensitivity&#13;
to the level of routine maintenance is very high.&#13;
24.   Sensitivity Analysis. Should traffic increase only by half (25 v/d instead of 48&#13;
v/d assumed for the base case) on the sections currently in poor or very poor&#13;
conditions, the ERR for the overall program will remain very high but two additional&#13;
sections will have an ERR below 12 percent. Therefore, the program execution on&#13;
these sections will start by spot improvement, execution of the rest of the program&#13;
(rehabilitation of drainage structures and periodic maintenance), being subject to an&#13;
actual increase of traffic after the spot improvement works have been completed.&#13;
25.   The reduction of the routine maintenance budget to the level of 1994 (CFA&#13;
franc 1.7 billion) would result to an ERR below 12 percent on 42 sections. The&#13;
investments in elimination of trouble spots. in rehabilitation of drainage structures&#13;
and in periodic maintenance on these 42 sections will be conditioned to the actual&#13;
execution of the maintenance programs at the required levels of service (CFA franc&#13;
2.7 billion per year). In the case when budgets are reduced, a rehabilitation works and&#13;
maintenance approach on these sections will be considered and thus the program&#13;
defined in the proposed program be redefined.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The strategy objectives of the Transport
            Sector Investment Program Project relate directly to country
            issues of competitiveness, administrative capacity, resource
            mobilization and private sector participation.  They are: a)
            to safeguard the competitiveness of Benin's transport
            sector and of its transit corridor through open modal
            competition; b) to improve Government's capacity for
            planning, programming, and managing transport sector
            investments; c) to boost infrastructure maintenance resource
            allocation; d) to boost the recovery of infrastructure user
            charges; e) to expand private sector participation in public
            works and maximize its impact on unskilled labor job
            creation; f) to build capacity in sector institutions and
            optimize human resource utilization; and g) to protect the
            environment and import road safety conditions.  The main
            components are: a) paved road construction, rehabilitation
            and maintenance; b) unpaved road rehabilitation and
            maintenance; c) institutional strengthening for road network
            management; d) feeder roads; e) port and maritime
            improvements; and f) airport rehabilitation.
