Water Kiosk Operators&#13;
Achieve Credibility in Kibera&#13;
&#13;
This field note describes practical actions taken to formalize the independent marketplace of water&#13;
kiosk operators serving poor households in a large urban settlement in Nairobi, Kenya. The&#13;
establishment of an association enabled a large group of local water operators to find common&#13;
ground and work together to improve their credibility, start a process of regulating their own service&#13;
and begin to develop a productive dialogue with the utility.&#13;

New climate for reform&#13;
&#13;
Political changes in 2002 ushered in a&#13;
new climate of reform in Kenya. The&#13;
new government's policies focus on&#13;
&#13;
good governance, devolution and a&#13;
positive investment environment.&#13;
Kenya has produced a Poverty&#13;
Reduction Strategy Paper, entitled&#13;
"Economic Strategy for Wealth and&#13;
Employment Creation". It emphasizes&#13;
poverty reduction through job creation,&#13;
investment in people, social protection&#13;
and good governance. A key pillar of&#13;
the National Poverty Eradication Plan is&#13;
improved access to basic social&#13;
services in conjunction with broad-&#13;
based economic growth.                    Most efforts to serve Kibera residents have been limited to the provision of a few standpipes&#13;

Challenges for&#13;
Nairobi's Water Utility&#13;
&#13;
Water supply in Nairobi has been&#13;
plagued for many years with&#13;
inefficiency and complex management&#13;
and logistical problems. This has led to&#13;
inadequate water services, with the&#13;
poor suffering the most. A 2002 study2&#13;
identified both the physical state of the&#13;
infrastructure and poor management as&#13;
key constraints.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Although the utility supplies 392,000&#13;
&#13;
cubic meters each day and&#13;
consumption is only 350,000 cubic&#13;
meters, there are constant shortages&#13;
and service interruptions. Of those that       A kiosk for retailing water&#13;

contamination of water during its&#13;
transportation from the utility network&#13;
to the kiosk. Many use low quality&#13;
plastic pipes to reduce costs, as metal&#13;
pipes are much more expensive and&#13;
could be stolen. Plastic pipes have the&#13;
added advantage of being flexible&#13;
enough to follow the winding and&#13;

perspective of the kiosk owners,&#13;
there are significant impediments to&#13;
registering a kiosk, managing its&#13;
operation, and getting enough water.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Water and Sanitation Program&#13;
in Africa (WSP-Africa) engaged with&#13;
kiosk operators in March 2003 to&#13;
learn more about their operations&#13;
and constraints. This initial contact&#13;
was very limited, consisting of&#13;
informal meetings with about 15&#13;
kiosk operators18. However, about a&#13;
year later, after the new Water Act&#13;
&#13;
was enacted, kiosk operators sought&#13;
WSP-Africa support over concerns&#13;
that the water sector reforms would&#13;
affect their businesses. This fear&#13;
arose from what they saw happening&#13;
in the transport sector. Here, under&#13;
much-needed reforms, new rules&#13;
were enforced for privately-managed&#13;
public transport and all drivers had&#13;
to re-register; but before this could&#13;
be achieved many of them were out&#13;
of business for months.&#13;

have already become part of the joint&#13;
utility/vendor dialogue, including:&#13;
· Reducing rent-seeking associated&#13;
     with registration of a kiosk,&#13;
     operation and bill-paying&#13;
· Reporting leaks where the kiosk&#13;
     operators have committed to&#13;
     informing the utility of network faults&#13;
· Making billing and collection more&#13;
     reliable and regular.&#13;
Some issues that are yet to be&#13;
addressed include:&#13;
· Reducing barriers to market entry&#13;
     for prospective kiosk operators by&#13;
     streamlining the registration&#13;
&#13;
     process, and making it easier for&#13;
     kiosk operators to access the&#13;

· Removing the solid waste that&#13;
     clogs the open drains of Kibera and&#13;
     contributes to contamination of&#13;
     water in the connections&#13;
· Developing a mechanism for&#13;

     storage and handling of the water,&#13;

            This field note describes practical
            actions taken to formalize the independent marketplace of
            water kiosk operators serving poor households in a large
            urban settlement in Nairobi, Kenya. The establishment of an
            association enabled a large group of local water operators
            to find common ground and work together to improve their
            credibility, start a process of regulating their own service
            and begin to develop a productive dialogue with the utility.
