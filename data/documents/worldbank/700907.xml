URBAN GROWTH AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE SAHEL&#13;
Past urban bias in public investment, and the inadequacy of&#13;
rural development efforts in harsh natural conditions, have made&#13;
Sahelian cities relatively privileged consumers in an environment&#13;
of extreme scarcity and deprivation. More equitable allocation of&#13;
national resources between rural and urban areas is essential if&#13;
the Sahel countries are to improve their incomes.&#13;
The urban population of the Sahel is expected to triple between&#13;
1975 and 2000; an addition of 8 million people, dt least half of&#13;
them migrants. Present conditions are inadequate to absorb such&#13;
an increase.  The miiajority of urban residents rely directly oL&#13;
indirectly on government employment, which has been the major&#13;
stimulus for urban growth, but in future is highly unlikely to&#13;
expand rapidly. There are serious constraints on the large scale&#13;
expansion of industry. It is urgently necessary to stimulate&#13;
employment in the informal sector, with particular attention to&#13;
the processing of agricultural products. The majority of urban&#13;
dwellers have low levels of services, largely reflecting a lack&#13;
of coherent policies toward urban growth. Widening the availability&#13;
of services will involve using lower cost standards for new facili-&#13;
ties, and recovering costs from the urban population at all income&#13;
levels. Urban sector analysis, within macro-economic planning,&#13;
needs to identify and encourage activities in secondary towns&#13;
which will support rural development.&#13;

PREFACE&#13;
This paper grows out of on-going work to develop an operational&#13;
strategy for urban development in the Sahelian countries of West Africa.&#13;
Background studies4Pre initiated in iate 1975 in preparation for   e&#13;
Bank Urban Projects reconnaissance mission to Ouagadougou, Upper Volta. These&#13;
studies were continued in 1976, focusing on Upper Volta and Mali, in support&#13;
of World Bank urban project work in those countries. Early conclusions of&#13;
the studies contributed to the design of these projects. In order to pull&#13;
together the individual country studies, and fill gaps in data, Danielle&#13;
Antelin worked during the summer of 1976 on the data base for the first draft&#13;
of the paper, which appeared in September 1976.  Further data analysis was&#13;
undertaken by Ms. Antelin on the urban sector content of the national develop-&#13;
ment plans of the Sahelian countries, and later by Anne de Mautort, on the&#13;
employment situation in urban areas.&#13;
The paper was originally intended to suggest a framework for policy&#13;
discussions concerning urban development in the Sahel. It was included in a&#13;
series of World Bank papers on the Sahel which were reviewed in 1976, when&#13;
the Western Africa Region of the World Bank was considering a long-term&#13;
strategy for the Sahel. Continued project work in the Sahelian countries&#13;
has added new insights which are included in the present version of the paper,&#13;
particularly in an expanded discussion of a proposed strategy and the con-&#13;
straints to implementation. The paper is not intended to serve as a policy&#13;
document for the World Bank, although it reflects some of the World Bank's&#13;
approach to urban development issues. Nor is it intended to reflect the&#13;
objectives and programs of the Western Africa Region of the World Bank.&#13;
Rather, it is hoped that the paper, in bringing together available information&#13;
from a data-scarce environment and attempting to suggest the lines of an&#13;
operational strategy, can contribute to a serious discussion of development&#13;
strategy in the Sahel and of how the urban sector can contribute to more&#13;
equitable and efficient development.&#13;
Many of the ideas in this paper come from an extended dialogue with&#13;
many colleagues at the World Bank concerning urban development in the Sahel&#13;
These include: Carolyn Tager, Jaime Biderman, Bernard Veuthey, Abdallah&#13;
El-Marroufi, Arthur Levi, Anthony Churchill, and Maurice Mould. I am parti-&#13;
cularly indebted to Douglas Keare who has supported this work over a period of&#13;
two and a half years and has provided many insightful analytic comments.&#13;
Outside the Bank, I would like to acknowledge the intellectual contribution of&#13;
Guy Lemarchands of the United Nations' Centre for Housing, Building and&#13;
Planning. Finally, the greatest inspiration for this paper comes from the&#13;
many Africans whom I have met in Upper Volta, Mali, and Senegal during the&#13;
course of writing this paper. This paper is intended to answer some of the&#13;
many questions which are asked of those who are seeking to assist Sahelian&#13;
governments in the urban sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I. A FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYSIS&#13;
1.        The countries of the Sahel region of West Africa:  Chad, Mali,&#13;
Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, and Upper Volta, are among the poorest and most&#13;
rural countlies of the world. Their populations live predominantly in rural&#13;
areas, depend on agriculture and livestock for food and income, and have&#13;
remained traditional in their culture. Despite their rural character, these&#13;
populations have been increasingly affected by decisions and activities&#13;
which occur in the small but growing urban centers in their countries.&#13;
External intervention in traditional patterns of agriculture and livestock&#13;
grazing, first by private French companies and the colonial administration,&#13;
and later by both the public and private sector after independence in 1960,&#13;
have disturbed the ecological balance of the region. While many of these&#13;
interventions, such as the introduction of modern production and marketing&#13;
methods and improved health care, have been beneficial to the populations,&#13;
other interventions have had unanticipated consequences, such as over-grazing&#13;
and famine in certain areas. In some cases, the declines in income for some&#13;
groups have resulted in the migration of rural populations to new zones of&#13;
economic opportunity, such as urban centers and the West African coast.&#13;
Increased contacts between the rural areas and these zones of economic opport-&#13;
unity have stimulated new patterns of migration along with the exchange of&#13;
goods, food, and other services. The coincidence of these developments with&#13;
the establishment of colonies under French administration and later the&#13;
creation of six independent African states has further supported the process.&#13;
Relatively small traditional urban centers became colonial headquarters and&#13;
eventually national capitals. Within this century, the Sahelian region has&#13;
experienced a major transformation, from a largely rural area inhabited by&#13;
scattered sedentary groups, nomads, and a few long established towns, into&#13;
six countries, with major areas of population concentration and new forms of&#13;
economic activity.&#13;
2.        The increased pace of urbanization over the past two generations&#13;
has led to three major forms of differentiation: economic, social and&#13;
political. Economic differentiation has occurred as some population groups&#13;
have responded positively to the introduction of new production methods,&#13;
transport, and communications in rural areas and used these means to exploit&#13;
agricultural and livestock resources more effectively. Farmers and herds-&#13;
men have generated surpluses and profits which they have been able to use&#13;
for other purposes. This has created new economic differences in rural&#13;
areas and has permitted some rural residents to invest their surplus in&#13;
commercial activities in towns. Some successful rural farmers have eventually&#13;
become absentee farmers, using hired labor on their holdings, and have taken&#13;
up urban residences. As towns developed, mostly through migration, the&#13;
Sahelian population has become increasingly socially differentiated between&#13;
rural and urban, illiterate and literate, and traditional and modernizing.&#13;
This process is extremely complicated and beyond this discussion, but the&#13;
concentration of permanent and temporary urban populations from scattered&#13;
rural peoples is an extremely important aspect of the Sahelian transformation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
3,        A third form of differentiation has also developed and is essenti-&#13;
ally poLtical. The changes introduced in the rural areas of the Sahel by the&#13;
French colonial administration were not simply economic or social, but were&#13;
also political. Traditional ethnic political systems were forced to accom_&#13;
modate French political objectives, including administrative control of the&#13;
regions in which local ethnic groups had traditionally ruled without extern&amp;i.&#13;
influences.  This control was highly centralized, with regional and territcl&#13;
capitals, and hierarchies of decision-making which extended as far as Parls.&#13;
While local political control was not given up without a struggle, central&#13;
authority was consolidated and developed up to 1960. At that time, under&#13;
strong internal and international pressure in the post-World War II period,&#13;
France granted independence to its Sahelian colonies. Within the countries,&#13;
the nationalist movements which had been most effective in articulating&#13;
African demands for independence and which had also worked out terms of&#13;
accommodation with France, were given political power in the new states. Not&#13;
surprisingly, the new political authorities came from the educated urban&#13;
elites which had been formed by the colonial experience and, despite their&#13;
contacts with rural populations, were more concerned with the consolidation&#13;
of political power in the national capitals than with extending economic&#13;
development to the rural sector. This consolidation also meant access to&#13;
benefits resulting from public policies which support urban development.&#13;
4         Taken together, the economic, social, and political differerntiation&#13;
which has occurred in the Sahelian countries has produced a widening gaR&#13;
in income levels between the rural and urban voulations-. The transfer of&#13;
surpluses generated in agriculture and livestock to urban commercial activities&#13;
and urban investment has been expanded and reinforced since independence. The&#13;
major e-ent of this reinforcement has been public policy which has demonstrated&#13;
a strong "urbarn bias".  This bIas has been characterized by Michael Lipton&#13;
as a bias i_n thie process, structure, and consequences o£ decisiones affecting&#13;
th.e ue of national resources in developing countries, 1!  Lipton argues&#13;
persuasively that development policies in many LDCs increase uroan privileges&#13;
at the cost of continuing poverty in rural areas.  Urban bias is reflected 3-&#13;
pricea  inestitutional opportunities, access to markets, communications and&#13;
'ransportation linkages, and many other structural characteristics of natlznal&#13;
economiea,  In the Sahel  this bias is found in the subsidized Rrices of feod&#13;

"parasitic" and "generative" cities. 1/ Professor Bert Hoselitz argued that&#13;
some cities were "parasitic" on the national economy, converting agricultural&#13;
surpluses into urban consumption while not producing goods or services&#13;
needed for economic growth. Other cities, however, were productive, either&#13;
through manufacturing, services, or through functions performed by their&#13;
location, or some combination of the three. These "generative" cities&#13;
assisted in the development process and indeed contributed additional stimuli&#13;
to growth. The Sahelian cities, however, while performing some administrative&#13;
and commercial functions necessary for national development, have survived&#13;
on the consumption of rural surpluses and in this sense can be viewed as&#13;
somewhat "parasitic" and "exploitative" vis-a-vis the rural sector.&#13;
6.        This characterization of the urbanization process in the Sahel is&#13;
noteworthy in three respects: first, given the recent increase in urban&#13;
growth across the six countries, it is apparent that increasingly large&#13;
surpluses are being converted into urban consumption or urban investment. This&#13;
conversion may take the form of taxes collected in rural areas which are used&#13;
for civil servant salaries in towns or for urban infrastructure investment&#13;
or low producer prices coupled with subsidized urban consumption of certain&#13;
goods. Regardless of the form, the pace and magnitude of this conversion&#13;
represents a major transfer of resources from the rural to the urban sectors.&#13;
Secondly, this transfer can be viewed as a conscious political choice which&#13;
is reflected in the allocation of public resources and policies affecting&#13;
the private sector. Obviously, "urban bias" has its political rewards in&#13;
gaining the support of urban-based political groups, such as labor unions&#13;
and civil servants. Thirdly, the transfer of surpluses from the rural to&#13;
the urban sector is neither efficient nor equitable, given the scarcity of&#13;
resources, and low incomes in rural areas. The size of total rural surplus&#13;
is barely sufficient to provide for the rural population, much less be used&#13;
to sustain urban populations at relatively higher levels of income. Urban&#13;
development thus drains away national resources needed for other higher&#13;
priority purposes. This view of the urban sector from a macro-economic&#13;
perspective is quite convincing, although, as suggested in later chapters,&#13;
the consequent "bias" often may result from justifiable actions taken in&#13;
other spheres.&#13;
7.        Importantly, this description of urban bias obscures the distribution&#13;
of absolute poverty within the Sahelian countries. Extremely poor people are&#13;
found within cities and towns, as well as in remote rural areas. The Sahelian&#13;
towns are as poor as any in the world; indeed, their levels of public services&#13;
are probably lower than those in almost any other developing country.&#13;
8.        Given the simultaneous existence within these countries of relative&#13;
urban welfare and deprivation for the majority of urban residents, what is&#13;
a reasonable approach to urban development in the world's most rural coun-&#13;
tries? This essay attempts to formulate answers to this problem by examining&#13;
1/   Bert Hoselitz, "Generative and Parasitic Cities":  Economic Development&#13;
and Cultural Change, Vol. 3, No. 2, 1955.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the following questions: What are the factors generating and supporting urban&#13;
growth in the Sahel? Will urban growth continue? If so, how can urban growth&#13;
be transformed from an essentially parasitic into a more generative process?&#13;
What are realistic policy objectives for the medium and long term? What are&#13;
the constraints to achieving them? And finally, what do we need to know to&#13;
answer these questions?&#13;
9.        In order to address these issues, the essay proceeds in the follow-&#13;
ing manner: Chapter II presents an historical overview of the urbanization&#13;
process in the Sahel, introducing the traditional Sahelian cities, the effects&#13;
of national independence on urban growth, and past patterns of urban bias&#13;
in national investment plans. Chapter III reviews the available demographic&#13;
projections for the Sahelian countries, focusing on expectations for con-&#13;
tinued migration and urban growth. These projections include those by the&#13;
United Nations, the FAO, the World Bank, Sahelian governments, and private&#13;
demographers. This review points to continued, rapid urban growth for the&#13;
next two decades, with a tripling of the 1975 urban population by the year&#13;
2000, and the need to absorb some eight million persons into the urban sector&#13;
over this period.&#13;
10.       Chapter IV examines the rural sector in some detail in order to&#13;
first understand the reasons for rural out-migration and the limited prospects&#13;
of increasing rural incomes in the short term. Chapter V then evaluates the&#13;
absorptive qapacity of the urban sector in the face of expected urban growth.&#13;
Absorption in this case refers to the provision of employment and urban&#13;
services for new urban population. A major conclusion concerning the urban&#13;
sector is that the capacity to provide services must be expanded, but that&#13;
this expansion requires policy changes involving the use of lower-cost&#13;
infrastructure standards and the need for recovery of investment costs from&#13;
the beneficiaries. At the same time, efforts should be directed towards&#13;
supporting informal sector activity which presently generates the majority of&#13;
employment in Sahelian urban centers.&#13;
11.       The last chapter proposes an operational strategy for urban policy&#13;
change and urban investment. This strategy, proposed in two phases, emphasizes&#13;
the need to reduce, if not eliminate, the parasitic character of the urban&#13;
sector through policy change, pilot projects, and eventually coordinated&#13;
programs of investment in low-cost urban infrastructure. While these programs&#13;
will address the needs of urban residents, urban development must at the same&#13;
time be considered in terms of the supportive functions which towns can&#13;
perform in promoting rural development. The notion of "urban functions in&#13;
rural development" thus links efficient urban development policy with the&#13;
broader need to increase rural productivity and incomes. 1/ This linkage is&#13;

through the identification of urban functions such as locations for marketing,&#13;
processing, storing, and provision of other services which are needed if&#13;
agriculture is to become increasingly productive. Towns therefore will have&#13;
to be developed with this objective in mind, and be truly "generative",&#13;
instead of enclaves of privilege amidst rural poverty.&#13;
12.       This essay raises many difficult questions concerning the role of&#13;
the urban sector in Sahelian development. It does not presume to provide&#13;
the answers. The formulation and implementation of policy in Sahelian coun-&#13;
tries--any policy--is a difficult process due to the weakness of local&#13;
institutions and the lack of trained manpower. These constraints must be&#13;
recognized from the outset and reflected in the analysis of current conditions&#13;
and prospects for improvement.&#13;
II. URBAN DEVELOPMENT IN THE SAHEL: AN OVERVIEW&#13;
A. The Meaning of Urban in the Sahel&#13;
13.       Urban development in the Sahel must be examined in the context of&#13;
a long tradition of cities and towns in the region. 1/ Cities such as&#13;
Timbouctou,.Djenne, Gao, Ouagadougou, Maradi, Kayes, or Tambacounda have&#13;
long histories, often pre-dating cities in Europe and in coastal African&#13;
countries. These centers performed important administrative and commercial&#13;
functions during particular historical periods, either as seats of sultanic or&#13;
traditional political power or as trading centers for trans-Saharan and&#13;
African caravans.  Strong cultural and religious traditions often developed&#13;
with these centers, explaining their significance to this day.&#13;
14.       The eventual eclipse of these centers resulted from their lack of&#13;
an independent productive economic structure. They were intermittent pheno-&#13;
mena -- rising and falling with the power and protection of traditional&#13;
rulers--without a permanent population or economy. Some centers, such as&#13;
Ouagadougou, were inhabited by people who cultivated nearby land for six&#13;
months of the year, but whose urban residence fluctuated, depending on rain-&#13;
fall. 2/ Aside from a relatively small number of commercial families, Sahelian&#13;
urban centers have not developed a long-term commercial or manufacturing&#13;

City: Doubleday Press, 1965); Elliot Skinner, African Urban Life;&#13;

Press, 1974), Rokiatou N'Diaye Keita, Kayes et le Haut Senegal: Les&#13;

structure. When administrative or trade patterns changed, the cities radic-&#13;
ally changed their roles, 1/ as in the case of Timbouctou in the past, but&#13;
also Bobo-Dioulasso after 1947, when it was no longer the colonial capital&#13;
of Upper Volta. The decline of Kayes or St. Louis was tied to similar&#13;
administrative decisions in this century.&#13;
15.       Conversely, changes in ecological conditions or accession to&#13;
national independence have revived or stimulated the growth of some cities.&#13;
Tombouctou and Gao swelled from 1972 to 1975, during the drought and Its&#13;
aftermath. Serving as food distribution centers and refugee camps, these&#13;
towns became more attractive to Malian merchants who have established new&#13;
businesses there. Bamako, Ouagadougou, Nouakchott, and N'Djamena have&#13;
grown rapidly after being designated national capitals by newly independent&#13;
governments. 2/ Niamey has grown as a result of both the drought and in-&#13;
dependence. Where towns have persisted, their roles have changed in response&#13;
to the requirements of administration, commerce, and ecology.&#13;
16.       Accession to national independence should not be viewed as a&#13;
radical departure from past patterns. While the long-term existence of the&#13;
six Sahelian states and their designated national capitals should certainly be&#13;
assumed in planning scenarios, their present importance has been short-term&#13;
compared to the role of Timbouctou and Gao over several centuries. The&#13;
present state system may be as transitory as those which preceded it.&#13;
17.       Nonetheless, there are two factors resulting from independence&#13;
which heavily influenced development planning options for the next 25 years:&#13;

18.       The concentration of administrative infrastructure and public sector&#13;
employment in national capitals--a process started during colonial rule and&#13;
further accentuated by statehood--has transformed the role of the six capitals&#13;
ln the past two decades. 3/ (See Section IV of this paper on employment&#13;

patterns). With the exception of Dakar which actually lost some public sector&#13;
employment in the first few years after independence in 1960 1/, as it was&#13;
no longer the capital of French West Africa, the Sahelian capitals have&#13;
become centers of high wage, permanent employment. Given the extremely high&#13;
wages of the public sector compared to rural incomes in all six countries,&#13;
urban centers have attracted rural migrants who, depending on their qualifica-&#13;
tions, often seek public sector jobs or employment in service activities&#13;
serving public sector employees. The private formal sector offers few&#13;
opportunities other than construction and some small-scale manufacturing.&#13;
Urban households swell with country cousins and their combined incomes sup-&#13;
port still more rural-urban migrants. 2/ The direct and indirect economic&#13;
dependency ratios of an individual public sector salary-earner, with multi-&#13;
plier effects, have increased dramatically.&#13;
19.       The growth of capital cities is further fueled by a concentration&#13;
of national budget expenditures in these cities. One analysis of deter-&#13;
minants of total government expenditures in francophone West African countries&#13;
shows that:&#13;
(a) the level of government expenditures as a percent of&#13;
GDP is significantly related to proportions of total&#13;
population living in urban areas (R - 0.83);&#13;
(b) "The absolute growth of government expenditure also&#13;
showed a tendency to be associated with an increasing&#13;
population in the urban areas (R - 0.71)";&#13;
(c) "The absolute number of people living in urban areas&#13;
had a much stronger influence upon the size of govern-&#13;
ment expenditure (R - 0.74) than had the size of&#13;
population." 3/&#13;
Since a large proportion of urban population growth is found in capital cities,&#13;
it appears that capital cities, as cities and as capitals, are stimulating and&#13;
consuming a significant share of total national budgetary resources. As Riha&#13;
notes, "The uneven distribution of government expenditure between urban and&#13;

-8-&#13;
rural areas intensified the migration to cities and this in turn led to a&#13;
further demand for government expenditure." 1/&#13;
20.       This concentration of national expenditures in capital cities was&#13;
justified for the political and administrative consolidation of newly inde-&#13;
pendent states. Its consequences for the national distribution of wage&#13;
employment and incomes, however, deserve further attention. Cities such as&#13;
Bamako and Niamey have little formal employment beyond the public sector.&#13;
Dakar and the Cap Vert region of Senegal provide the sole major exception, but&#13;
even there the public sector is a major employer of skilled labor. Sahelian&#13;
cities remain fundamentally dependent on income from the public sector.&#13;
21.       This pattern of biased public sector development is also found within&#13;
capital cities, where public sector employees enjoy a disproportionate share&#13;
of available urban services and the administration as a whole is a major con-&#13;
sumer. 2/ In Ouagadougou, for example, the administration share is 50 percent&#13;
of total water consumption. 3/ In N'Djamena, private water connections serve&#13;
12 percent of the population and together with the other large consumers,&#13;
such as industrial and commercial firms, account for more than 90 percent of.&#13;
total consumption. Similar statistics are found in housing, power, health&#13;
services, provision of credit, and education in other Sahelian cities.&#13;
22.       In contrast to urban conditions, the needs of the rural population&#13;
have grown,.particularly since the drought of 1968-74. For example, the&#13;
decline of real income from groundnuts and cotton in Niger to one-fifth and&#13;
one-half of 1970 levels by 1974, reflects the drought and fragile structure&#13;
of agricultural production. 4/ World wide attention to the destruction of&#13;
Sahelian livestock herds, poor soil conditions, and low rainfall was only&#13;
generated by the drama of already devastatingly poor conditions reaching&#13;
below the margir of subsistence. Since 1960, indeed going back to the 1920's&#13;
and the creation of the Office de Niger, the rural sector of the Sahelian&#13;
countries, again with Senegal in a favored position, has experienced only a&#13;
slow growth of income. 5/ It remains perhaps the poorest region in the world.&#13;
Accession to national independence has not led to major productive successes&#13;
4n agriculture. Experiences in the six countries have reportedly failed to&#13;
-1 t planners' expectations. This has often been due to the lack of one or&#13;
r,. e of the following: (a) marketing, (b) processing, (c) storage, (d) tools&#13;
machinery, and (e) education and rural extension.&#13;

23.       This list, derived from various sources, is not novel. 1/  Out from&#13;
the urban perspective, it is intriguing. The above inputs for productive&#13;
agriculture can only be combined if linked together at particular locations.&#13;
Thus, concentration may be needed to economically support all of these&#13;
activities. Agriculturally-oriented secondary towns may be essential pre-&#13;
conditions of productive agriculture. 2/&#13;
24.       This conclusion is also not novel.  Indeed, Government officials&#13;
and donor agencies have long agreed on the need for smaller than national&#13;
planning units (i.e., regions) for both administrative and investment plan-&#13;
ning. The Sahelian countries have created individual versions of these,&#13;
from the ORD's in Upper Volta to zones in Mali and even international region&#13;
such as Liptako-Gourma, including Mali, Niger, and Upper Volta. Agriculture&#13;
in regional development areas was supposed to be improved by the phased&#13;
provision of international inputs and the reduction in overheads. The&#13;
intended increases in agricultural production, however, have not been realize&#13;
as easily as was originally hoped. 3/ This has been due to the low levels of&#13;
production and investment initially in place, but also to the difficulties&#13;
of diffusing innovations. 4/ Most importantly, there has been a generally&#13;
consistent experience of not having the required inputs and services listed&#13;
above.&#13;
24.       Within this context, secondary centers may be useful from two&#13;
perspectives: they could provide the localized inputs and services needed&#13;
for production, including credit, and also serve as markets for rural products,&#13;
thereby providing incentives for farmers. The opportunity to consume goods&#13;
found in urban markets could stimulate rural production and lead to increases&#13;
in real income.&#13;
25.       This view of the potential role of the urban sector contrasts&#13;
sharply to the well-documented claim by some analysts of the Sahelian drought&#13;
and famine that the urban sector, represented by the colonial administrators&#13;
and subsequently the urban-based independent governments, has exploited rural&#13;
farmers and pastoralists in a manner which caused the drought of 1968-74.&#13;
Some observers of the Sahelian countries have convincingly concluded that&#13;
past policies towards management of the natural and human resources of the&#13;

region--its soils, water sources, rivers, nomadic survival traditions, and&#13;
even the population itself--have contributed heavily to the severe famine&#13;
conditions which developed during the period of low rainfall. A group of&#13;
French Marxist scholars, including some of the best-known anthropologists a&#13;
economic historians of the region, established the Comite Information Sahel&#13;
which published three books in 1974 and 1975, focusing on the political and&#13;
economic causes of the Sahelian drought. 1/  The titles of these books,&#13;
including "Who is Being Fed by the Famine in Africa?", were sufficiently&#13;
controversial to generate substantial attention in the French and African&#13;
press at the time of publication. Less dramatic, but equally forceful&#13;
was an article published by Michael Lofchie in 1975, entitled "Political and&#13;
Economic Origins of African Hunger". 2/  Lofchie argued that political and&#13;
economic processes, rather than natural phenomena, were the major causes of&#13;
famine in Africa. Studies of the droughts in Ethiopia and elsewhere in&#13;
East Africa have established a substantial body of literature which is charac-&#13;
terized by one of its titles "The Myth of the Natural Disaster" by Nicole&#13;
Ball. 3/&#13;
26.        This view of the famine conditions in rural areas holds that the&#13;
French emphasis on cash crop production by Sahelian peasants led to the&#13;
"ecological degradation" of areas suitable for agriculture. The terms of&#13;
trade for agricultural products were biased in favor of urban consumers&#13;
rather than rural producers. The latter were thus forced to plant in-&#13;
creasingly large areas to generate income needed for survival. This led to a&#13;
reduction in the fallow period for land, deforestation, and extension of&#13;
growing into marginal lands.  All of the above exacerbated already difficult&#13;
ecological condiltions.  The ecologically destructive consequences of the&#13;
policies towards agriculture were compounded by continual emphasis by colonial&#13;
and national adminiistrators on increasing livestock.  This led to overgrazing&#13;
and eventually the destruction of the pastoral communities in the Sahelian&#13;
countriese Not surprisingly, the pastoralists, such as the Touaregs, were&#13;
the most severely hurt victims of the so-called "natural 9$disaster". 4/&#13;

27.       While this analysis does not place the urban residents in the first&#13;
row of the guilty, it does, by continual inference, suggest that policies&#13;
serving the urban sector contributed in large measure to the impoverishment&#13;
of rural areas. Historically, this criticism can be supported by the repeated&#13;
experiences of rural development programs which have not gon^ far enough to&#13;
achieve improvements in rural incomes or nutrition, but have generated new&#13;
jobs for public sector administrators. The burden of proof, therefore, that&#13;
urban development can be planned and implemented in a manner which does not&#13;
worsen the urban-rural terms of trade or rural-urban income distribution is&#13;
thus placed on urban policy-makers. The degree to which this consideration&#13;
is truly taken into account will depend heavily on the institutional capacity&#13;
of the Sahelian governments. Their relatively poor performance in this&#13;
respect is reviewed in subsequent sections.&#13;
B. Past Patterns of Urban Investment&#13;
28.       The above description of the urban sector and its linkages with the&#13;
rural sector illustrates past patterns and problems, and some potential for&#13;
the future. The actual role of the urban sector, however, will depend on&#13;
Government policies and investment programs affecting urban centers. This&#13;
section will review past urban investment patterns in the Sahelian countries&#13;
as indicated in the national development plans of the respective countries.&#13;
This review is necessarily incomplete, given the scarcity of data and the&#13;
gap between official plan intentions and the actual implementation of parti-&#13;
cular programs. Many projects and programs in development plans are not&#13;
realized as a result of a lack of finance, personnel, or changing national&#13;
and sectoral priorities. Nevertheless, the plans do indicate Government&#13;
priorities at a particular point in time and suggest the preferred role of&#13;
the city in national development. For the purposes of this rough analysis,&#13;
urban investment includes all investment located in urban centers which&#13;
contributes to urban services and employment.  This is a broader definition&#13;
than the one used in plans in these countries, i.e., including only urban&#13;
services such as housing or public utilities.&#13;
29.       The first significant characteristic of urban investment in the&#13;
Sahel is that it represents roughly between 20 and 30 percent of total public&#13;
investment in each country. This range is significant because it is consider-&#13;
ably higher than the percentage of urban population found in each country,&#13;
(see Chapter III), and indicates the past "urban bias" of development&#13;
investments in the world's most rural countries. Within the six countries,&#13;
there is some variation as indicated in Table 1, with Chad at the bottom&#13;
with 19 percent in 1967 compared to Senegal which reached 39 percent in its&#13;
most recent plan, 1972 to 1976. It is interesting to note than "town-planning",&#13;
in the French sense, meaning urban public infrastructure, applied in the six&#13;
countries accounted for less than a quarter of the total, with the exception&#13;
of Senegal, where town-planning investments reached almost-half of urban&#13;
investment.&#13;

30.       A second noteworthy characteristic of these past public investment&#13;
patterns is that towns other than the national capitals receive relatively&#13;
small shares of total allocations to the urban sector. These shares vary&#13;
from 27 percent in Niger and Senegal, respectively. When compared to the&#13;
distribution of urban population, despite the importance of the capital&#13;
cities, it is clear that secondary towns do not receive an equitable share on&#13;
a per capita basis. While it could be argued that the administrative overhead&#13;
costs of national capitals necessarily lead to disproportionate expenditures&#13;
in the capitals, this imbalance is a persistent phenomenon which appears to&#13;
grow more acute with each subsequent investment program. Whether this trend&#13;
stems from the fact that previous investment permits a greater absorption of&#13;
new investment or whether the capital cities have greater needs, the resulting&#13;
bias towards the capital cities reinforces economic and spatial patterns&#13;
which can only be changed through major policy shifts at the national level.&#13;
31.       A third characteristic of past urban investment is its multi-&#13;
sectoral nature. Not only does a major share of housing and urban development&#13;
expenditure go to capital cities, but these proportions also apply to industry&#13;
and services. The imbalances reflected in this allocation emphasize the pri-&#13;
macy of the capital cities in every aspect of national life, except agricul-&#13;
ture and transportation. The patterns for individual countries are presented&#13;
in tables in Annex II.&#13;
III. PATTERNS OF URBAN GROWTH: THE PAST AND THE FUTURE&#13;
37.       This chapter is based on analysis of various demographic data&#13;
collected from different sources. Data on individual Sahelian countries are&#13;
seriously incomplete. A comparative, aggregate analysis of these data, pre-&#13;
sented below, is both hazardous and methodologically unsatisfying. Neverthe-&#13;
less, the essential importance of demography in Sahelian development necessi-&#13;
tates a serious effort to understand past trends and to develop projections&#13;
for the future.&#13;
A. The Past&#13;
National Population Growth&#13;
38.       The Sahel consists of six countries which cover a vast area, much&#13;
of which is uninhabitable. Table 2 presents the 1975 population of the region&#13;
and the six countries, as projected by the United Nations in 1974, and national&#13;
population growth rates for 1970-1975.&#13;

These data will be compared to other projections in Section B of Chapter III.&#13;
However, for baseline purposes, they demonstrate the similarities and dif-&#13;
ferences between the six countries.&#13;
The Urban Sector&#13;
39.       Table 3 presents urban population as percentage of national popu-&#13;
lation in 1975.&#13;

These data show the low level of urbanization of the Sahelian countries, with&#13;
the relative exception of Senegal, which-has twice the Sahelian average, and&#13;
as high as in Niger and Upper Volta. The size of Dakar and the coastal Cap&#13;
Vert region in absolute terms, differentiates Senegal from the other countries.&#13;

This low level of Sahelian urbanization, 14 percent, compares with 69 percent&#13;
in developed regions and 27 percent in other less developed regions in 1975. I/&#13;

40.       Given the low level of urbanization, it is not surprising that the&#13;
Sahelian countries have relatively high rates of urban growth.  Table 4&#13;

rates.&#13;

other less developed regions. They are higher than the Africa-wide figure of&#13;

Urban Population Distribution&#13;
41.       Within the urban sector, there are substantial differences in urban&#13;
growth rates between capital cities and secondary centers. Table 5 presents&#13;
the distribution of the urban population among capital cities and other urban&#13;
centers. It shows the large proportion of urban population located in the&#13;
capitals of Sahelian countries, with the case of Nouakchott the most extreme&#13;
at 75 percent, followed by Dakar. The countries of the interior average&#13;
33 percent of urban population in the capitals. Similarly, these countries&#13;
have a limited number of other centers over 10,000, as almost 50 percent of&#13;
their urban population living in towns over 10,000 is located in the capital,&#13;
even when the size of the capital varies by a factor of 2.&#13;

Despite the not strictly comparable growth rates between centers of different&#13;
sizes, there is nevertheless a clear indication that large towns have been&#13;
growing faster than smaller ones, and that capital cities have so far grown&#13;
the most rapidly. Comparisons of Tables 4 and 6 show that capital cities grow&#13;
faster than the urban sector as a whole, and, given their statistical pre-&#13;
dominance in the distribution of urban population, account for a substantial&#13;
proportion of the high rates of national urban growth. As expected, growth&#13;
rates of capitals experience a step wise increase at the time of independence.&#13;
The likely evolution of this pattern is examined in subsequent pages.&#13;
Regional Distribution of the Growth of Urban Population&#13;
43.       The location of cities is linked to high rural densities.  Cultiva-&#13;
tion and population are located (1) in the southern regions of the countries,&#13;
(2) along the ocean, or (3) along rivers (the Senegal, Niger, or Logone-Chari).&#13;
Only the Volta River does not support cities and high rural densities, because&#13;
of the prevalence of river blindness. Very few urban centers are found in&#13;
areas where temporary wells are predominant. The largest cities are located&#13;
in the south, in agricultural areas. Other, usually less important, centers&#13;
are situated in more northern livestock areas. With the exceptions of Bamako&#13;
and Dakar, the capital cities are located at the border of the two climatic&#13;
and vegetational rural zones.&#13;
44.       Analysis of available data shows that the fastest growing towns&#13;
are located in the fastest growing regions. For example, Senegal Oriental is&#13;
the fastest growing region in Senegal, and so are its towns (4.9 and 7 percent&#13;
respectively). This is also the case of Maradi in Niger.&#13;
The Sources of Urban Growth: Migration and Natural Increase&#13;
45.       The difference between the national population growth, i.e., the&#13;
mean natural increase of population and observed rates of urban population&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
growth, theoretically reflects migration to and away from urban areas. For&#13;
the Sahel as a whole, the annual population growth rate is 2.3 percent,&#13;
in contrast to the urban growth rate of 5.0 percent. The difference, 2.7&#13;
percent or roughly 50 percent of urban growth, can be attributed to net&#13;
rural-urban migration. Given the age distribution of the urban population,&#13;
however, it is apparent that there is a natality shift towards urban areas,&#13;
with many rural-urban migrants moving to towns during their most fertile&#13;
years. This fertility shift is somewhat muted in the Sahelian countries&#13;
by the frequently male-character of temporary migration and by high levels&#13;
of urban female sterility, as high as 27 percent in Chad. 1/  It is neverthe-&#13;
less apparent that urban growth is fueled by heavy migration and fertility&#13;
higher than the national average.&#13;

47.       Table 7 shows that from 40 to 65 percent of the growth of the&#13;
urban sector is attributable to migration, with the Sahelian average at&#13;
54 percent. This conclusion is consistent with findings in most African&#13;
countries, although less than is found for larger cities in many developing&#13;
countries. 1/  The annual absolute totals of rural-urban migrAnts are als&#13;
substantial, particularly for Senegal, where Dakar attracts migrants from&#13;
throughout the region.&#13;
48.       This pattern is consistent for capital cities, which have a higl r&#13;
proportion of their growth directly attributable to rural-urban migration,&#13;
as shown in Table 8.&#13;

Indicators of Migration&#13;
49.       In addition to this aggregate calculation of the migration share of&#13;
total urban growth, there are other indicators demonstrating the importance&#13;
of migration in this process. 2/ These include: male-female ratio, ethnic&#13;
composition, age distribution, regional origins, and permanence of urban&#13;
populations. While data for these indicators are not complete across the&#13;

six countries or even for all capital cities, those data which are available&#13;
further demonstrate the importance of migration.&#13;
Male-Female Ratio&#13;
50.       Given the historical trend of temporary, male migration to urban&#13;
areas in Africa, it has been widely observed that the early stages of urban&#13;
growth, with the highest growth rates, are accompanied by male dominance in the&#13;
urban population. As migration becomes more permanent, male migration evolves&#13;
into household migration and an evening of the male-female ratio. A comparison&#13;
of urban and national male-female ratios shows the sex bias of the urban popu-&#13;
lation. As shown in Table 9, the Sahel region as a whole is a net provider&#13;
of male labor to coastal West African and European countries and, therefore,&#13;
does not have a 100 or equal ratio itself.&#13;

Note: Male-female ratios are the number of males per 100 females.&#13;
51.       The case of Senegal is noteworthy because the national ratio of&#13;
91.9 indicates substantial male emigration outside the country, yet Dakar&#13;
itself has a significantly higher male component. Taken together these&#13;
ratios suggest the Dakar population is more male than the national average.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
This has important implications for employment, income distribution, dependency&#13;
ratios, and the provision of social services. The case of Chad is similar,&#13;
though to a lesser degree.&#13;
52.       While capital cities in the coastal countries, such as Abidjan,&#13;
Accra, and Brazzaville have experienced a shift toward permanent household&#13;
migration and an evening of male-female ratios in the past decade, 1/ this&#13;
was less apparent in the Sahel before the drought. The drought, however, has&#13;
led to greater movements of households from stricken rural areas.&#13;
Ethnic Composition&#13;
53.       A second indicator of migration is the ethnic composition of the&#13;
total urban population and the population of particular urban centers. While&#13;
data are unavailable for the total urban population, there have been some&#13;
studies, frequently anthropological, which show that (1) the ethnic composi-&#13;
tion of a city is different from the original inhabitants of the area, (2)&#13;
this composition changes as the city grows, and (3) the older the city, the&#13;
more diverse the composition, suggesting in some cases, migration from specific&#13;
places of origin. This process has been documented for Bamako, 2/ Dakar 3/&#13;
Niamey, 4/ and Ouagadougou. 5/ The first three of these capitals have become&#13;
increasingly heterogeneous, now attracting migrants from the far corners of&#13;
the national territory and beyond. Ouagadougou, capital of a country almost&#13;
60 percent Mossi and the traditional capital of that ethnic group, has changed&#13;
more slowly, but it, too, is no longer simply a Mossi-dominated town, as&#13;
evidenced by its recently-appointed non-Mossi mayor.&#13;
1/   Abidjan's ratio shifted from 139 to 122 from 1955 to 1963.  By 1965,&#13;
Accra had reached 114, while Brazzaville was 106. Michel Bloch-Lemoine,&#13;

L'Exemple de Niamey (Paris: Universite de Paris, Institut&#13;
d'Ethnologie, 1969).&#13;
Age Distribution&#13;
55.       Given the higher probability of migration for the age group between&#13;
19 and 39, it is likely that there should be a higher proportion of this&#13;
age group in urban areas. This conclusion was confirmed in Dakar in 1963 and&#13;
Chad in 1964) during periods of relatively high male migration.&#13;
Regional Origins&#13;
56.       Another indicator of the migratory character of the urban popula-&#13;
tion is its regional origin. Although this is frequently correlated with&#13;
ethnic identity, this is not always so, particularly in countries with&#13;
mixed settlement patterns. Urban migrants tend to inhabit towns within&#13;
or near their region of origin.  Migrants to Bamako and Dakar have largely&#13;
come from nearby areas. In Senegal, some 75 percent of migration to Dakar&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
comes from three areas near Cap Vert: Diourbel, Fleuve, and Thies. 1/ As&#13;
noted above, fast-growing urban centers tend to be located in fast-growing,&#13;
densely populated rural areas, such as Senegal Oriental.&#13;
Permanency of the Urban Population&#13;
57.       A fifth indicator of the migratory origins of urban residents&#13;
is the proportion of "floating" or temporary population. This indicator&#13;
reflects the lack of permanent, non-seasonal urban employment as well as&#13;
ties to agriculture or livestock in rural areas. Studies of this "floating"&#13;
population in Mali in 1973 showed that some 23,000 of 35,000 persons in&#13;
Mopti, one of the largest towns outside the capital, classified themselves&#13;
as "floating" or temporary urban residents. 2/ Bamako, now with 350,000&#13;
persons, had a floating population of some 60,000 in 1973. Similar patterns&#13;
are found in Ouagadougou, where 50 percent of the active labor force classi-&#13;
fied themselves as "cultivators", in many cases leading to four to six months&#13;
absence from the city each year. While such patterns do not, in all cases,&#13;
indicate migratory origins, a large proportion of the Ouagadougou population&#13;
was born outside the city and retains strong economic and cultural ties&#13;
to rural villages.&#13;
Understanding Past Urban Demographic Patterns&#13;
58.       Previous pages have presented an overview of past urban demographic&#13;
patterns in the Sahel. Urban growth, while historically intermittent, has&#13;
been rapid and sustained since 1960. At least half of this growth can be&#13;
attributed to rural-urban migration, with some countries and capital cities&#13;
experiencing even heavier inflows from rural areas. The increase in popula-&#13;
tion movements around the time of independence and a later increase during and&#13;
after the drought of 1968-74 suggests economic motivations of two kinds!&#13;
predominantly "pull" factors around 1960, particularly with the creation of an&#13;
indigenous public sector in the capital, and predominantly "push" factors&#13;
during the periods of severe rural deprivation during and after the droughtc&#13;
While both "pull" and "push" factors have operated continuously since in-&#13;
dependence, and before, as reflected by the century-old history of Sahelian&#13;
outmigration to coastal areas, this somewhat simplified characterization&#13;
highlights two important processes. The first is the general increase in&#13;
urban incomes associated with the post-independence period. Urban incomes are&#13;
more permanent and tend to keep up with inflation. A second process is the&#13;
relative impoverishment of rural areas. The latter received substantial&#13;
assistance before the drought, but this disaster has led in many cases&#13;
to a continuing decline in absolute real incomes over four or five years&#13;
and a certain decline in relative income compared to the urban sector.&#13;
59.       The demographic processes presented in this section have occurred&#13;
within this economic context. The results are dramatic, a significant&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24 -&#13;
proportion of the rural population each year leaves the land in pursuit of&#13;
more permanent incomes in urban areas. Towns have swelled, rapidly surpass-&#13;
ing their capacities to provide minimal services, such as water, waste&#13;
removal, shelter, and social services. Nonetheless, these services are&#13;
apparently less important to potential migrants than the hope of income-&#13;
earning opportunities in urban areas. As suggested above, the multipliers&#13;
of public sector employment have generated many opportunities, even if the&#13;
resultant disposable income is small. As households have swelled, their&#13;
dependency ratios have also increased: urbanites cannot turn away their&#13;
country cousins. The ritual of extended job-search is often financed by&#13;
a single household wage-earner. This has been the pattern of the past,&#13;
relying on relatively high urban incomes from positions in the public sector.&#13;
Pasit urban growth has thus benefitted from a windfall of income which is&#13;
certain not to come again from the same source. How future growth will&#13;
be supported or absorbed is a question which must be addressed by all pro-&#13;
jections of the future.&#13;
B. Projections&#13;
60.       This section will present a series of demographic projections&#13;
for the Sahel from different sources. In many cases, these different pro-&#13;
jections are quite close to one another. After all categories of projection&#13;
are presented, the most reasonable alternatives will be summarized. As&#13;
suggested earlier, urban growth patterns result from behavioral responses&#13;
to urban-rural income differentials. Projections must therefore reflect&#13;
developments in both the urban and the rural sectors.&#13;
National Population Growth&#13;
61.       There are several alternative sources of Sahel-wide and national&#13;
total population projections: the United Nations, World Bank estimates,&#13;
Societe Centrale de l'Equipement de Territoire International (SCET), FAO,&#13;
John Caldwell, and a 1972 study by Hossenlopp. 1/ Table 12 presents projec-&#13;
tio11s for 1965 to 2000 for the Sahel and the six countries according to each&#13;
source.&#13;
62.       The most important conclusion from Table 12 is that total popula-&#13;
tion is expected to almost double in the next 25 years. This conclusion&#13;
stands despite small changes in growth rates for specific countries for given&#13;
periods as prolected by the six sources.&#13;
63.       Table 11 presents the above in terms of growth rates for 1975-2000.&#13;
The relatively high death rates found in the region are expected to decline&#13;
in the future, thereby increasing total population growth rates through the&#13;
year 2000.&#13;
1/   The assumptions for these projections are presented in Annex II.&#13;

64.       Interestingly, the only projection which attempts to relate populi&#13;
tion growth to food production, the SCET analysis, produces three scenarios&#13;
which include emigration from the Sahel. These are presented below as Table&#13;
13, showing that at certain levels of population and food production, con-&#13;
ditions will force emigration from the region.&#13;

d'Une Strategie Anti-Secheresse dans le&#13;
Sahel de l'Afrique de l'Ouest, 1975,&#13;
pp. 26-29.&#13;
These scenarios are discussed in greater detail in Section IVC below, but it&#13;
should be noted here that the SCET report shows that food production deter-&#13;
mined the size of sustainable population and, therefore, required emigration.&#13;
This is estimated to be from 2 to 8 percent of total population, depending&#13;
on the availability of food in rural areas. The food constraint is also a&#13;
strong "push" factor in rural-urban migration, as shown below.&#13;
Urban Population Growth&#13;
65.       The first major demographic shift is in the percentage of total&#13;
population in urban areas. Table 14 presents these data from 1960 to 2000,&#13;
according to different sources. Table 14 shows large increases in the urban&#13;
share of the total population. From 1975 to 2000, in all countries except&#13;
Senegal, according to all projections, the relative size of the urban sector&#13;
doubles or nearly doubles. Senegal, nonetheless, increases its already&#13;
sizable urban population by some 50 percent. For the region as a whole,&#13;
the urban sector grows from some 14 to 24.1 percent.&#13;

66.       Table 15 presents the projected absolute size of the urban popu-&#13;
lation according to different sources. The absolute increases in urban&#13;
population from 1960 to 2000 are so large that by 2000, every country,&#13;
with the exception of Mauritania, will have a larger urban population than&#13;
the total Sahelian urban population of 1960. In absolute terms, the urban&#13;
population will be six times larger in 2000 than it was in 1960 and three&#13;
times larger than in 1975. In the next 25 years. some 8,187.000 persons&#13;
would have to be absorbed into the urban sector, i.e. provided with employ-&#13;
ment and urban services.&#13;

68.       These rates have different trends, according to rates of national&#13;
population growth and their bases. Four of the six countries were projected&#13;
to have increasing rates of growth which level off and then decline to rates&#13;
of the 1960's. Chad and Mali, however, are projected to experience falling&#13;
and rising trends, respectively. The most important facts ab'out these&#13;
projections are that they are generally quite high and that their averages&#13;
for the period are quite close, regardless of the source. The United Nations&#13;
1975-2000 averages are lower for all countries than the 1975-1990 FAO averages,&#13;
but the FAO figures do not include the decline expected from 1990 to 2000.&#13;
The slight differences between the UN and FAO figures for all countries and&#13;
the region as a whole are not large enough to deserve serious attention,&#13;
given the poor quality of the data base upon which the projections are made.&#13;
An average annual urban growth rate of around 5 percent for 1975-2000 for&#13;
the region as a whole should be sufficient for planning purposes.&#13;
69.       In contrast to the above, projections for the period 1965-1985&#13;
are higher. Hossenlopp projects higher rates for all countries, as shown&#13;
below in Table 17, but this reflects a definition of urban as towns of above&#13;
10,000 population.&#13;

70.       Given the statistical importance of large centers, and particularly&#13;
capital cities, it is necessary to project the population of these centers&#13;
to determine the distribution of urban population in the future. Table 18&#13;
presents available data for capital cities of individual countries.&#13;
71.       These projections are calculated according to three methods:  (1)&#13;
growth rates of the past five years, 1970-1975; (2) the projected growth&#13;
rate of the sector for the period; and (3) the mean between (a) the projected&#13;
sectoral growth rate plus the present differential between capital city and&#13;
the sector, and (b) the sectoral growth rate. All of these suggest very sub-&#13;
stantial growth, but as discussed in subsequent chapters, the economic base&#13;
to support this population is still to be established. Table 19 presents the&#13;
results of these three methods in terms of growth rates for five-year periods.&#13;

These projections demonstrate the demographic consequences of present rates.&#13;
The outcome of method I is not possible because, according to UN projections,&#13;
the entire urban sector would be absorbed into the capital. That of method II&#13;
is unlikely, because capital cities tend to grow faster than the urban sector&#13;
as a whole. That of method III maintains this capital city bias and is thus&#13;
a more likely view of the future.&#13;
72.       The second category of urban centers are towns outside the capital&#13;
or "other urban". In view of unavailable data on urban size distribution,&#13;
Table 20 presents the growth of "other urban" as the difference between&#13;
total urban growth and capital city growth for the period.&#13;
73.       Having assumed growth rates for capital cities, growth rates for&#13;
other urban centers are calculated as the difference between the growth of&#13;
the total urban sector and the capital city as projected above.&#13;
74.       According to these methods of projection, there would be a sub-&#13;
stantial increase in the size of secondary urban centers for this period.&#13;
Method I, however, should be eliminated because nearly the entire urban&#13;
population is shifted to the capital. Method II shows a large increase,&#13;
but does not take into account the attraction of the capitals. Method III&#13;
shows a significant increase in "other urban", from 2.5 to 3.0 times the&#13;
1975 "other urban" population. This does not include the emergence of new&#13;
small towns during the period. Table 21 presents these data in terms of&#13;
growth ra'tes for five-year periods.&#13;
75.       Previous pages have presented alternative statistical projections&#13;
for the growth and distribution of urban population in the six Sahelian&#13;
countries and the Sahel. Although the baseline data from which these pro-&#13;
jections are derived are of uncertain quality, there is nevertheless a&#13;
general consensus concerning projections made by different sources: UN,&#13;
FAO, Hossenlopp, Caldwell, SCET, and the Bank. Figures in summary Table 22&#13;
can be used as working figures in broader economic analysis and planning&#13;
for the region. Nevertheless, it is clear that whether these or other&#13;
figures actually result will depend on the occurrence of specific processes&#13;
within the urban and rural sectors. The magnitude of rural outmigration&#13;
depends on levels of food and cash-crop production and resultant incomes.&#13;
Urban growth depends on urban absorptive capacity, i.e., the ability of&#13;
towns to provide employment and services, including water and food, for&#13;
increasing urban populations. Chapters IV and V examine these processes in&#13;
more detail, though necessarily briefly, to suggest that future population&#13;
distribution between the urban and rural sectors will ultimately depend on the&#13;
human interactions with the environment. Included in these interactions&#13;
will be government policies towards food and cash-crop production, urban-rural&#13;
terms of trade, investment in opening up new areas for cultivation and settle-&#13;
ment, development of water resources, and urban employment. These inter-&#13;
actions emphasize the dependent rather than the independent character of&#13;
demographic processes.&#13;

IV. CONDITIONS IN THE RURAL SECTOR&#13;
76.       The futute of the Sahel depends on the development of agriculture&#13;
Urban population will be less numeroue than rural population in the foresee-&#13;
able future. The urban sector and the econiomy as a whole will be dependent&#13;
on the productivity of agriculture, both for cash crops for export and for&#13;
food. 1/ An understanding of demographic processes and urbanization in the&#13;

Sahel must begin from analysis of conditions in the rural sector. If at&#13;
least half of urban population growth can be attributed to rural-urban&#13;
migration, as shown above in Table 7, it is apparent that much of the causation&#13;
producing urbar: growth stems from the rural sector, i.e., in the conditions&#13;
which encourage people to migrate to urban centers. 1/&#13;
A. The Evolution of Rural Incomes&#13;
78.        Under the drought conditions from 1968 to 1974, there was a general,&#13;
sometimes dramatic, decline in rural incomes. While this trend varies among&#13;
crops, regions, and countries, extensive data have been analyzed, showing&#13;
that in comparison with 1967-69, the next four and sometimes five years&#13;
produced drastic cuts in the cash and real incomes of Sahelian farmers.&#13;
Table 23 presents the general trend for this period.&#13;

These aggregate figures reflect an adverse trend in incomes varying with&#13;
rainfall during the period. 2/ Thus, by the end of 1974, real income&#13;
from groundnuts and cotton in Niger dropped to 22 and 49 percent of 1970&#13;
levels.  Agriculture in some areas was entirely wiped out, whille other&#13;
parts of the same countries remained relatively untouched. These patterns&#13;
will have continuing demographic implications for generations, in that&#13;

substantial population movements occurred out of the most stricken areas&#13;
towards locations where water, food and later, jobs were available. These&#13;
locations, often centers for emergency food distribution, became popula-&#13;
tion concentrations overnight, while others gained renewed importance, as&#13;
in the case of Timbouctou. The essential causal link, however, was that&#13;
rural real incomes, in the form of food and water, had declined to below&#13;
subsistence levels, thereby requiring migration for survival.&#13;
B. Immediate Term Rural Out-Migration&#13;
79.       The poor conditions of the rural sector in the Sahel region as a&#13;
whole, suggest that there will be continuing out-migration from rural areas.&#13;
While rural income levels have improved in the past two years, these improve-&#13;
ments often remain small in comparison to the rising incomes found elsewhere,&#13;
both in Sahelian towns and in coastal West African countries, such as the&#13;
Ivory Coast, where both rural and urban incomes have increased substantially&#13;
during the Sahelian drought period. 1/ Some slowing down of rural out-migra-&#13;
tion should be expected if agricultural recovery continues according to the&#13;
trend of 1974/75. This slowing down, however, will be temporary if rural&#13;
incomes stagnate or, in the face of increasing total rural population,&#13;
actually decline. In the latter case, renewed, large-scale out-migration will&#13;
begin again, although at a slower pace than during the recent natural disaster&#13;
of the drought.&#13;
C. Scenarios of Future Long-Term Agricultural Development&#13;
80.       Several alternative scenarios of future, long-term agricultural&#13;
development for the Sahel have been worked out by interested institutions.&#13;
The two most detailed ones were prepared by the Societe Centrale de l'Equip-&#13;
ment de Territoire/International (SCET) and the United Nations Food and&#13;
Agriculture Organiation (FAO). Both studies attempt to relate population&#13;
levels to food production and the creation of agricultural employment. Only&#13;
the SCET report, however, suggests hypotheses concerning the distribution of&#13;
future Sahelian population growth into the rural and urban sectors. An&#13;
elaborate set of three scenarios has been prepared linking alternative govern-&#13;
ment policies towards food and cash crop production and demographic distri-&#13;
butions in 1985 and 2000. The direction of causation is incorrect in this&#13;
analysis, i.e., it starts from demographic hypotheses and derives levels of&#13;
food production necessary to feed urban and rural populations, rather than&#13;
showing that rural production will determine the distribution of population&#13;
between the urban and rural sectors.   Nevertheless, the SCET scenarios are&#13;
interesting, because they use significantly different demographic scenarios.&#13;

84.       Within the SCET analysis, there is also attention to the location&#13;
of areas for possible cultivation. This is shown in Table 25.&#13;
85.       The major conclusion from Table 25 is that the areas of already&#13;
higher agricultural yields should be enlarged, in part through the develop-&#13;
ment of water resources and more intensive cultivation. Geographically,&#13;
this implies concentrated development in the two southern zones of the region,&#13;
where substantial opportunities exist for future agricultural incomes. While&#13;
in some countries, such as Mali, this implies large investment in construction&#13;
of dams and irrigation systems, such as the Manantaly and Selingue dams; in&#13;
others it implies the eradication of riverblindness along river basins, such&#13;
as in Upper Volta. The latter objective, however, will be extremely difficult&#13;
to achieve.&#13;
86.       From the urban perspective, it is apparent that urban investment&#13;
should be encouraged in regions where substantial agricultural potential&#13;
exists, thereby supporting rural development through the provision of needed&#13;
agricultural inputs and channels for marketing, processing, and storage.&#13;
In Upper Volta, the headquarter towns of the ORD's with the greatest potential&#13;
should be supported to complement and increase the agricultural productivity&#13;
of the region. Similar strategies should be adopted in Mopti, Maradi, or&#13;
Zinder to the extent that needed inputs or channels for output are lacking.&#13;
87.       Despite the above, it should be noted that rural out-migration&#13;
is not solely dependent on rural income levels. Substantial evidence exists&#13;
to show that differentials between rural and urban incomes are the major&#13;
determinants of rural out-migration. Understanding the likely magnitude&#13;
of this movement thus requires an analysis of the ability of the urban sector&#13;
to generate incomes for an increasing population in the future.&#13;
V. THE ABSORPTIVE CAPACITY OF URBAN CENTERS&#13;
A. The Meaning of Absorptive Capacity&#13;
88.       Previous chapters have examined the demographic character of urban-&#13;
ization and conditions in the rural sector. Little attention has been devoted&#13;
to the capacity of urban centers to absorb increasing population, in either&#13;
the present or future. For the purposes of this analysis, absorption refers&#13;
to the generation of employment and income, coupled with the provision of&#13;
essential urban services such as water, shelter, transport, health, and&#13;
education. 1/ Given the extreme deprivation found in Sahelian countries,&#13;
the "absorption" of new population refers,, at the limit, to the provision of&#13;
conditions permitting survival. However, even the stocks of water and food&#13;
1/   A further explanation of absorptive capacity can be found in Beier,&#13;

found in urban areas will eventually decline, leaving the population forced&#13;
to develop means to generate income to acquire these essential items. 1/ In&#13;
this sense, urban populations must be economically organized in order to&#13;
generate the incomes needed for trade with rural areas or external sources&#13;
for food. It is this organization and its capacity to generate increasing&#13;
opportunities for earning individual and household incomes v.ich will deter-&#13;
mine the long-term growth of individual cities. If the income-earning&#13;
opportunities are not to be found in Ouagadougou, rural Voltaics will go&#13;
elsewhere, often to the Ivory Coast or Ghana.&#13;
89.       The second part of absorptive capacity is the provision of urban&#13;
services. The literature on migration has not shown that migrants come to&#13;
town in search of services alone, except in extreme conditions such as the&#13;
Sahelian drought, and that income-earning opportunities are the major urban&#13;
attraction. Nevertheless, if urban conditions are too difficult and services&#13;
too costly, the economic benefits of urban residence will decline, thereby&#13;
decreasing the incentives for long-term urban residence. For the city as a&#13;
whole, inefficient provision of services reduces the productivity of labor and&#13;
increases negative externalities, such as pollution, congestion, and health&#13;
hazards, thereby resulting in further reduced productivity for the urban&#13;
economy. The important point here is that not only must cities be able to&#13;
generate employment, but they must be organized to provide the essential&#13;
services needed to maintain productivity, such as shelter, water supply, waste&#13;
removal, health care, transport and education.&#13;
90.       It is from this dual perspective, employment and urban services,&#13;
that the projected growth of cities must be examined. Will Sahelian urban&#13;
centers be able to generate sufficient employment and provide services to&#13;
support an increasing population in the future? This question is as impor-&#13;
tant for understanding future urbanization patterns as are conditions in&#13;
rural areas. In order to answer this question, it is necessary to evaluate&#13;
past performance for both aspects of absorptive capacity.&#13;
B. The Generation of Urban Employment and Incomes: Past and Future&#13;
91.       Most Sahelian towns have not sustained productive economic structures&#13;
over long periods. The administrative and commercial character of the larger&#13;
towns have depended heavily on the political authorities and trading patterns&#13;
of the period.  While colonial rule and later independence led to the estab-&#13;
lishment of relatively permanent locations for administrative infrastructure&#13;
and public sector employment, these have not been complemented by greatly&#13;
expanded manufacturing and commercial activities in most cities. Indeed, the&#13;
modern or formal sector has been heavily dominated by government employment&#13;
1/   A clear explanation of this process can be found in Jane Jacobs, The&#13;
Economy of Cities, New York: Random House, 1969.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

in most of the Sahelian countries, with Senegal being a major exception.&#13;
Tables 26 and 27 present available employment data at the national level.&#13;
92.       These data show the following major characteristics of non-&#13;
agricultural employment:&#13;
(1)  the formal sector employs less than 8 percent of the&#13;
total active population and less than 15 percent of&#13;
the urban active population;&#13;
(2)  within the formal sector, employment is divided&#13;
equally between the public and private sector,&#13;
with the exception of Mali, where public enterprises&#13;
play a larger role in the productive sectors of the&#13;
economy;&#13;
(3)  the secondary sector in these countries is relatively&#13;
undeveloped and employs only a minor share of total&#13;
formal sector manpower; and&#13;
(4)  given the small size of the formal sector and its low&#13;
employment of the urban population, it is apparent that&#13;
the majority of urban residents generate income from&#13;
the,informal sector and/or agriculture.&#13;
93.       Table 28 presents the breakdown of employment within the formal&#13;
sector. The table shows that, with the exception of Senegal whose private&#13;
formal sector is considerably more developed than the other Sahelian coun-&#13;
tries, the private formal sector is small, largely divided between industry,&#13;
commerce, and transport, and represents only a small proportion of total urban&#13;
employment.&#13;
94,       The productivity of these activities is suggested in Table 29,&#13;
indicating available data on value-added contributed by the formal sector.&#13;
Agricultural productivity is very low, particularly in Mauritania and Upper&#13;
Volta. The highest productivity is found in industry, but many of the firms&#13;
in this sector are foreign-owned and thus only a small share of the value-&#13;
added remains in the domestic economy. The limited size of this sector does&#13;
not allow major benefits to be spread to secondary towns or rural areas.&#13;

by sector, Table 30 presents available data on female employment in the fsrmal&#13;

97.       The small size of the formal sector within the economy becomes&#13;
particularly important when considered in terms of the income differential&#13;
between urban and rural areas. Table 32 presents indices of the evolution&#13;
of the real incomes of farmers and unskilled urban wage earners in the&#13;
Sahelian countries, alongside indices of statutory minimum wage rates and&#13;
urban consumer price indices for the period 1967/68 to 1974/75. These data&#13;
show that urban real incomes did not increase absolutely during this period.&#13;
Indeoed there is evidence of decline, particularly due to inflation. Still,&#13;
as slhown by consumer price indices, the differential between urban and&#13;
rural real incomes increased significantly. With farmer income in 1973/74 in&#13;
Niger dropping to 25 percent of 1967/68 levels, while urban incomes dropped&#13;
only to 80 percent of 1967/68 levels, there was a dramatic widening of the&#13;
disparities between the rural and urban sectors. These disparities are&#13;
further demonstrated by Table 33 on wage indices by sector. Berg concluded&#13;
that wage earners in the modern sector were hurt least of all groups by the&#13;
drought. He notes that "income differentials between those in the 'formal'&#13;
and "informal' sectors undoubtedly widened, as in-migration increased in&#13;
urban areas and returns to labor in that sector tended to become more de-&#13;
pressed, while statutory minimum wages, applicable only in the 'formal' sector&#13;

increased substantially." 1/ Thus, urban income distribution is heavily&#13;
skewed toward those in the modern sector, a large proportion of whom are&#13;
government employees. This privileged group stands in marked contrast to&#13;
the majority of urban residents but more significantly, in another world&#13;
altogether from the bulk of rural population. Even the urban poor are&#13;
better off than many rural farmers. The political implications of these&#13;
differentials will become more significant as urban population increases.&#13;

98.       Another interesting feature of the distribution of income within&#13;
these economies is the fact that while the formal sector accounts for a bmall&#13;
proportion of the labor force, the higher wages found in that sector create&#13;
a situation in which the total wage bill for the formal and informal sectors&#13;
is roughly equal. Table 34 presents some available data for Niger which&#13;
illustrate this characteristic. While Niger in 1970 is not representative&#13;
for all of the Sahelian countries, it is close to the situation found in&#13;
Chad and Upper Volta as well.&#13;

Source: World Bank Estimate for 1970.&#13;
These data suggest the likely inequality to be found within the urban econo-&#13;
mies in Sahelian countries as well as relatively small size of the formal&#13;
sector.&#13;
99.       Given this past performance on the employment and income side, what&#13;
can be expected for the future? Table 35 presents the comparison between&#13;
jobs offered and sought in the formal sector. With the exception of Senegal&#13;
where the data suggest that supply and demand are reaching some equilibrium,&#13;
there are very large disparities between job offers and job seekers. This&#13;
situation will become increasingly serious if urban population grows at the&#13;
rates projected in Chapter III.&#13;
100.      Several major factors will influence the growth of employment.&#13;
First, and most importantly, it is highly unlikely that public sector employ-&#13;
ment will increase rapidly in the future. This fact has varying significance&#13;
for the Sahelian countries, with less effect on Senegal which has a sub-&#13;
stantial growing private sector in urban areas, and very serious implications&#13;
for others such as Upper Volta, Niger or Chad, whose urban population relies&#13;
heavily on government employment and its consequent income multipliers.&#13;
In the latter cases, it means that alternative sources of urban employment&#13;
will have to be generated from a presently small, relatively poor base.&#13;
101.      A second implication for future growth of employment is that there&#13;
are few large-scale urban employers outside of government in these countries,&#13;
again with the exception of Senegal. There are, at most, a handful of&#13;
factories in each capital city, with additional activities in towns suth as&#13;
Bobo-Dioulasso or Maradi. The paucity of investment in manufacturing reflects&#13;
the lack of financial capacity and natural resources to be utilized in&#13;
production processes, but also the lack of large-scale national markets for&#13;

manufactured goods. While larger markets exist in the West Africa region&#13;
as a whole, reaching these markets requires a higher level of capitalization&#13;
for individual firms, particularly including transportation. For the economy&#13;
as a whole, it is also apparent that the domestic resource costs implied in&#13;
manufacturing non-agriculturally-based goods are extremely hi-h. Thus, as&#13;
demonstrated in a study of comparative advantage in West Africa, 1/ it&#13;
makes little economic sense to encourage the development of manufacturing&#13;
industries other than those which process agricultural goods, particularly&#13;
livestock and non-cereal cash crops. This analysis, spelled out in greater&#13;
detail in recent World Bank economic reports and the Balassa study itself,&#13;
suggests that only a particular kind of industrial strategy will make sense&#13;
for the landlocked countries. Therefore there are serious economic con-&#13;
straints to a large-scale expansion of the urban industrial sector.&#13;
102.      A third implication of this situation is that most of the needed&#13;
jobs for the future will have to come from the informal sector, particularly&#13;
small-scale businesses which manufacture on a scale consistent with local&#13;
markets but do not require large investment. Given the size of potential&#13;
markets and therefore of potential profits, it is unlikely that small-scale&#13;
entrepreneurs will be able to expand their operations beyond certain limits&#13;
or have the capital required for investment in more efficient machinery or&#13;
more expensive materials. Levels of productivity, therefore, will not in-&#13;
crease substantially after an initial period. This characterization of future&#13;
development of the informal sector suggests that, in the aggregate, it will&#13;
be unable to expand rapidly, unless it is linked to processing agricultural&#13;
products for export, in which case it may eventually become part of the&#13;
formal sector.&#13;
103.      All of the above implies that unless the private sector is&#13;
increasingly linked to processing agricultural goods, there will be limits&#13;
to the quantity of employment and income it will be able to provide in urban&#13;
areas. Reaching these limits will have several consequences, including an&#13;
increase in dependency ratios, a decrease in per capita real income, and&#13;
a stagnation of the urban economy. With the public sector no longer providing&#13;
increasing income to the urban sector, there will be a narrowing of urban-&#13;
rural income differentials, if rural incomes do not decline. This would&#13;
reduce the attraction of the cities and lead to a decrease in urban growth&#13;
rates. A similar process has occurred in parts of India, such as Bengal,&#13;
and notably Calcutta, 2/ where rural-urban migration has declined steadily in&#13;
the past decade, leaving more people on the land in stagnant rural conditions.&#13;

C. The Provision of Urban Services&#13;
104.      Discussions of urban growth projections do not usually hinge on&#13;
the provision of urban services. In the long term, income-earning opport-&#13;
unities are the major attraction for potential rural-urban migrants. Yet,&#13;
in the short term, conditions of natural disaster or extreme deprivation&#13;
as found in parts of the Sahel during the height of the drought, urban&#13;
Areas may be considered as the only guarantee of survival. Even the most&#13;
minimal levels of consumption of food and water are better than rural&#13;
starvation. Approached from this perspective, it is possible that deter-&#13;
ioration in the provision of urban services on a per capita basis may not&#13;
have the immediate consequences such as a deterioration could have in coun-&#13;
tries where the rural sector is relatively productive and food is plentiful.&#13;
But, if urban conditions approached the character of refugee camps such as&#13;
those outside Niamey during the drought, it is possible that potential&#13;
migrants from rural areas would leave the Sahel for the coast.&#13;
105.      This scenario presents the extreme case, but under present con-&#13;
ditions it is quite likely that urban services will not meet the needs&#13;
of future populations unless government policies are oriented towards the&#13;
anticipated growth. To the present time, Sahelian governments have been&#13;
unable to mount effective programs for the provision of urban services. While&#13;
there are some promising signs, such as the Voltaic experience with a pilot&#13;
low-income shelter project in the Cissin neighborhood of Ouagadougou, or&#13;
substantial past investments which could be used more efficiently, such as the&#13;
drainage and transport systems found in Bamako, the overall level of services&#13;
is low. Table 36 presents an aggregate view of these conditions. These&#13;
general data are clearer in the context of a specific city, such as Bamako,&#13;
for which reasonably complete data are available, as shown in Table 37. It is&#13;
apparent from Table 37 that while there are great disparities in living&#13;
conditions between high income restdential neighborhoods and other areas, the&#13;
majority of the urban population lives with low levels of services. Nonethe-&#13;
less, the migrants continue to come and constitute a large share of the&#13;
populations, forming new quartiers and new settlements which have grown&#13;
quickly, particularly on the periplhery of the city.&#13;
106.      These service levels refLect several important facts concerning&#13;
the public management of urban growth.  Given the magnitude of their rural&#13;
problems, most Sahelian governments have not developed coherent policies&#13;
towards city growth. Scarcity of trained manpower in urban planning,&#13;
engineering, architecture, and economics are reflected by a policy vacuum&#13;
in Chad, Mali, and Niger. Mauritania imported technical assistance to build&#13;
its new capital, and Senegal has had longer experience with urban management&#13;
and services, going back to the colonial period. Only Upper Volta seems to&#13;
be adopting a longer-term view of its urban service needs, again on the&#13;
basis of its experience withi the Cissin project.  For all of the countries,&#13;
howvever, there remain gerious long-term problems of financing services,&#13;
providing sufficient wAter and waste disposal, and developing land use poli-&#13;
cies consistent with the inicome levels of the urban populations. The lack&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
of finance in all the countries is a major constraint to service provision of&#13;
all kinds. These issues are discussed further in the concluding chapter.&#13;

D. Expanding Absorptive Capacity&#13;
107.      The brief overviews of urban employment and urban services presented&#13;
above suggest that the present economic conditions of urban areas do not offer&#13;
immediate opportunities for absorbing large-scale migration from rural areas.&#13;
While urban incomes, even from intermittent underemployment, are better than&#13;
rural incomes, there are not many immediately obvious areas for increasing&#13;
employment. Little is known concerning the urban informal sector in these&#13;
countries, although it appears to employ a substantial proportion of the urban&#13;
population. The modern sector is faced with serious constraints, such as&#13;
limits on public sector expansion, high domestic resource costs for manu-&#13;
facturing most non-agricultural products, small-scale national markets, and&#13;
the scarcity of credit for expansion of some necessary enterprises. Urban&#13;
services are generally in poor condition in most cities, if available at all.&#13;

Their improvement will require policy changes towards a longer-term view Cii&#13;
potential demand and realistic pricing if they are to be maintained over&#13;
time.&#13;
108.      This sober assessment of present conditions is not intended to&#13;
imply that nothing can be done to increase absorptive capacity. Indeed,&#13;
it is apparent that much can be done on both the employment and the services&#13;
sides. An integrated approach to the problem could expand the capacity of&#13;
the urban sector to absorb rural-urban migrants and at the same time increase&#13;
productivity, hopefully by producing goods and services required by the rural&#13;
sector in its efforts to develop agriculture.&#13;
VI. UNCERTAINTY AND FACTORS INFLUENCING URBAN GROWTH&#13;
109.      Analysis of conditions in the rural sector and the constraints&#13;
on the absorptive capacity of Sahelian towns emphasizes the uncertainty&#13;
of urban growth projections for the region. While the variation between&#13;
different projections is small, none of these projections has taken rural&#13;
and urban conditions into account in projecting the future. With the&#13;
exception of the SCET study, there are no explicit assumptions concerning&#13;
migration out of the Sahel. Historical patterns of migration to the&#13;
coastal West African countries demonstrate that this is a real and&#13;
frequently chosen alternative to Sahelian poverty. It is precisely this&#13;
poverty which limits confidence in projections, because if rural conditions&#13;
become marginally worse in some countries, there will be significant rural&#13;
out-migration. Alternatively, the relative poverty of rural areas compared&#13;
to the privileged conditions of the towns suggests that a decline in urban&#13;
incomes may not immediately deter potential migrants. Indeed, the frequently&#13;
discussed motivations of potential migrants, and the high degree of economic&#13;
information which appears to influence their decisions elsewhere, may not&#13;
be so important for the Sahel in the short run. Towns represent security&#13;
against the environment and thus may grow even while urban employment and&#13;
living conditions deteriorate.&#13;
110.      Understanding rural responses to changing incomes in rural and&#13;
urban areas is thus the critical problem in accepting projections for the&#13;
short and long term. In the short run, perhaps for the next five years,&#13;
migrant behavior will still be conditioned by consequences stemming from&#13;
the drought and slow recovery. Higher incomes from agriculture will likely&#13;
keep rural farmers on the land. In the longer run, however, improved rural&#13;
incomes could be used to leave rural areas for towns or the coast. This&#13;
movement could be justified for the individual welfare of rural households,&#13;
but also for the Sahelian economies as a whole. If the population can find&#13;
higher incomes outside of rural areas, then GDP would also be increased,&#13;
including the addition of remittances where relevant.  The important poin.---&#13;
here are that (1) improved rural incomes cannot be expected to necessarily&#13;
stabilize rural population in the long term, and (2) such a stabilizatior.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
need not be considered desirable in itself, but only if accompanied by a&#13;
maximization of total welfare for countries and the region as a whole.&#13;
111.      Schematically, it is apparent that urban growth patterns and&#13;
population distribution will result in the long term from interactions&#13;
between several major variables: climate, government policies in the urban&#13;
and rural sectors, resulting economic trends in each sector, and the differ-&#13;
entials in opportunities between the Sahelian and the coastal West African&#13;
countries.&#13;
Climate&#13;
112.      Even though there has been an extensive literature on the cyclical&#13;
character of rainfall and drought in the region, the consensus appears to be&#13;
that the Sahel can expect fluctuating rainfall as a regular phenomenon, but&#13;
that drought as in the worst period of 1972-74 is unlikely to occur for the&#13;
region as a whole in the next five to ten years. The present 1977-78 drought,&#13;
however, is serious and has already disrupted agriculture throughout the&#13;
region.&#13;
Government Policy in the Rural Sector&#13;
113.      Government policies affecting cultivation of food and cash crops&#13;
will influence the rate of urban growth. Policies and investment programs&#13;
will also determine the capacity of the land to sustain increasing rural&#13;
population. If no new areas are opened up, or if major projects such as&#13;
the river blindness eradication program fail to create new cultivable lands,&#13;
increased rural population will be forced to migrate to cities or leave&#13;
their countries or the region as a whole. Similarly, if government pricing&#13;
policies do not encourage increased agricultural productivity, there will&#13;
be more migration from rural areas. Taken together, policies towards the&#13;
rural sector which (1) encourage greater productivity, (2) choose an economic-&#13;
ally and nutritionally sustainable mix between food and cash crops, (3) in-&#13;
crease farming acreage, and (4) do all of these in a synchronized, integra-&#13;
ted manner, will raise rural incomes to levels which satisfy rural popula-&#13;
tion and may thereby limit rural-urban migration in the short to medium term.&#13;
As noted above, however, the long-term response to improved income is less&#13;
clear. It is more certain, however, that a failure of government to improve&#13;
rural conditions will lead to more, rather than less, rural-urban migration&#13;
and increased emigration from the region.&#13;
Government PolicL in the Urban Sector&#13;
114.      Despite constraints on expanding the absorptive capacity of Sahelian&#13;
urban centers, continued urban growth can be expected. This expectation&#13;
requires that urban growth be managed on a non-subsidized basis, with full&#13;
cost pricing of services and improved productivity. Government policy will&#13;
have to encourage the expansion of employment opportunities in the informal&#13;
sector- Subsidized services and increased public sector employment will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
further attract rural-urban migrants, if not directly, then through the&#13;
income multipliers these will create. If the urban sector could be isolited&#13;
financially, i.e. operate without rural subsidies, including food price sub-&#13;
sidies, yet be economically linked to the rural sector by providing inputs&#13;
and services necessary for increases in agricultural productivity and incomes,&#13;
it could promote growth of rural incomes. A rationalization of the manage-&#13;
ment of the urban sector could decrease the artificial privilege which it has&#13;
heretofore enjoyed. This could be beneficial in discouraging categories of&#13;
potential rural-urban migrants who are likely to come to town simply to live&#13;
off multipliers of this inflated standard of living. For those on the edge&#13;
of rural starvation, more austere conditions in town would still be better&#13;
than those in the desert.&#13;
The Differential Opportunities between the Sahel and the Coast&#13;
115.      A fourth group of factors which will influence Sahelian urban growth&#13;
will be perceived opportunities to earn income in the coastal West African&#13;
countries. Large-scale labor migration from the Sahel has been occurring&#13;
since after World War I. 1/ The coming of independence and the economic boom&#13;
of the 1950's and 1960's quickened this growth, particularly with the abolition&#13;
of forced labor in the francophone colonies after 1947. As long as there is&#13;
continued relative economic prosperity in the coastal countries, in both rural&#13;
and urban areas, there will be a strong pull for potential migrants from&#13;
Sahelian rural areas. In the past, for example, rural Voltaics passed through&#13;
Ouagadougou or Bobo-Dioulasso on their way to the Ivory Coast, knowing that&#13;
the "Ivoirian miracle" could provide a higher probability of obtaining wage&#13;
employment than could the Voltaic economy. Moreover, market wages, in both&#13;
rural and urban sectors in the Ivory Coast, would be higher than their coun-&#13;
terpart at home. The large Voltaic population in Ivory Coast and Ghana,&#13;
estimated as high as two million persons, or one-third of the Upper Volta&#13;
population during some seasons, demonstrates the attraction of the coast.&#13;
116.      This pattern has changed in recent years, particularly as the&#13;
coastal countries have had xenophobic reactions to increasing proportions&#13;
of foreigners in their population. Open discrimination and harassment of&#13;
foreigners has slowed down the migration to the coast, and other areas, such&#13;
as Gabon, have gained new attraction for migrant labor. In the Ivory Coast,&#13;
this decline in the foreign African labor force has begun to hurt agriculture,&#13;
creating labor shortages in some areas. As demonstrated in recent studies&#13;
of the Ivory Coast, however, the Ivoirian strategy relies heavily on this&#13;
labor force and, therefore, can be expected to make efforts to recapture its&#13;
temporarily lost allure. 2/ While the rate of increase of coastal employment&#13;
depends on the success of the development strategies of the respective coastal&#13;

.Mossi vers Abidjan et sa region (Paris: Aubier-Montaigne, 1968).&#13;
2/   IBRD, Ivory Coast:  The Challenge of Success.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
governments, it is certain that these increases will be at least as rapid as&#13;
new opportunities are created in Sahelian rural areas, and most likely,&#13;
considerably faster. It is therefore quite reasonable to expect an accelera-&#13;
tion of migration out of the Sahel if the coastal and Sahelian governments&#13;
do not place restrictions on these population movements.&#13;
117.      One scenario concerning the Sahelian-coastal employment relationship&#13;
is the possibility that a West African economic union would promote free ex-&#13;
change of foreign exchange necessary to meet its essential needs. Given the&#13;
raw materials and opportunities for profitable agricultural investment in the&#13;
coastal countries, it is likely that under these conditions many rural inhab-&#13;
itants of the Sahel would leave their homes to obtain much higher incomes in&#13;
the south.&#13;
118.      When considered together in a non-static relationship, these factors&#13;
couldl interact to produce a range of urban growth patterns. For policy&#13;
purposes, projections of urban growth should assume that present growth rates&#13;
will decline slowly from 1975 to 2000. This decrease, however, will be&#13;
accompanied by a steady increase in the absolute and relative size of the&#13;
urban population during the period. As noted earlier, the total Sahelian&#13;
urban population will be some three times greater in 2000 than in 1975. This&#13;
increase presents a substantial challenge to national and loca.L authorities to&#13;
provide employment and urban services. The problems in meeting this challenge&#13;
have been discussed above. They are real and lack easy solutions. On the&#13;
rural side, the problems are even greater in magnitude and complexity.&#13;
Government efforts to increase rural productivity will determine whether&#13;
Sahelian populations will ultimately remain in their countries or leave for&#13;
more promising conditions elsewhere. These demographic projections, therefore,&#13;
could be significantly changed by the success or failure of governmental&#13;
efforts.&#13;
VII. TOWARDS AN OPERATIONAL STRATEGY FOR THE URBAN SECTOR&#13;
119.      Based on the previous analysis, this chapter will present 1) the&#13;
objectives of an operational strategy for managing and developing the urban&#13;
sector within the national and regional development of the Sahel; 2) the&#13;
policy and investment programs to be pursued in the short and medium term;&#13;
and 3) the obstacles to implementation of the strategy. This section is&#13;
based on both the analysis of existing conditions and operational experience&#13;
developing projects in the Sahel and West Africa more generally.&#13;
A.   Objectives for an Operational Strategy&#13;
,20.      The over-riding objective of urban development in the Sahel must&#13;
be to productively contribute to national and regional economic development.&#13;
This contribution focuses on the role that urban centers can and should&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
play in supporting development in essentially rural agricultural economics&#13;
and how the centers are themselves organized. The meaning of that support&#13;
will be spelled out in subsequent sections of this chapter. It is impDrtant,&#13;
however to recognize that there will be many prior actions to be taken,&#13;
policies to be formulated, institutions strengthened, analytic understandings&#13;
reached, and political bargains worked out before the urban sector can be&#13;
organized to reverse its present role as a privileged consumer in an environ-&#13;
ment of extreme scarcity and deprivation. While the long-term goal of a&#13;
productive urban sector supportive of agricultural and rural development can&#13;
be supported in principle by everyone involved, it will be much more difficult&#13;
to implement a policy app:oach which seeks to stimulate economic growth while&#13;
at the same time redistributing the meager product of the economy, now coming&#13;
almost exclusively from the rural sector. Urban residents who have left rural&#13;
areas in search of employment and services have benefitted from "urban bias."&#13;
Reducing or eliminating that "bias" will be politically difficult in countries&#13;
where the urban elite control political power. The proposition, therefore,&#13;
that urban development can be oriented towards the rural sector and towards&#13;
supporting long-term economic development is faced with fundamental political&#13;
obstacles which will not be overcome in a single meeting of the Council of&#13;
Ministers. Rather, there are a series of more specific operational objectives&#13;
which constitute the building blocks for achievement of the long-term strategy.&#13;
121.      Starting from this perspective and given the extreme poverty of the&#13;
region, it is clear that realistic objectives for an urban development strategy&#13;
which makes macro-economic and regional sense in the Sahel are necessarily&#13;
limited objectives. The Sahelian countries have severe shortages in all of&#13;
the elements needed to formulate and implement policies, whatever they may&#13;
be. These elements include trained manpower, fiscal resources, executive and&#13;
administrative organization, and political continuity. Operational objectives&#13;
in this context must be developed for the short, medium, and long term, with&#13;
each phase building on the previous one in order to develop institutional&#13;
capacity to perform various functions needed to carry out coherent policy.&#13;
Central to this view of a strategy for the Sahel is the notion that major&#13;
program objectives will not be clearly achieved within identified time periods,&#13;
but that simultaneous incremental improvements will be needed on various&#13;
fronts in order to permit the governments, at both national and local levels,&#13;
to seriously confront the problems facing them.&#13;
122.      What are the operational objectives for urban development policy in&#13;
these countries? These are presented below:&#13;
(1) Gaining Control Over Unmanaged Growth of the Capital Cities&#13;
123.      A first objective is to gain control over the unchecked growth of&#13;
the capital city in each of the six countries. This control is necessary in&#13;
order to reduce the present level of national subsidies to the capital and&#13;
to shift the financial burden for the relatively higher standard of living&#13;
in the capital from the pulic budget to those who benefit from it. The&#13;
national governments must attack the most evident example of "urban bias" in&#13;
the countries by establishing new policies for capital cities for the provision&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
of urban services such as housing, water supply, waste disposal, road main-&#13;
tenance, schools, health centers, and other related services. This policy&#13;
shift requires review of the present system of pricing and distribution of&#13;
services in order to develop methods of recovering an increasing share of&#13;
the economic cost of services provided and, to the greatest extent possible,&#13;
eliminating the subsidies which are now enjoyed by urban consumers.&#13;
124.      This concern with capital cities is justified on the following&#13;
grounds: (1) the capital cities are consuming large amounts of national&#13;
revenues which should be devoted to rural development, (2) income levels&#13;
in the capital cities cannot be justified in view of the extreme deprivation&#13;
in rural areas, and (3) efficient allocation of scarce national resources&#13;
is essential if these countries are to improve incomes in the future.&#13;
(2) Develop Alternative Methods of Providing Low-Cost Urban Services&#13;
125.      Related to the above, the Sahelian governments must re-examine the&#13;
standard and types of services provided to their growing urban populations.&#13;
It is clear that the methods of services provision, with their emphasis on&#13;
relatively high levels of service as in the case of housing, cannot reach the&#13;
majority of urban residents who are primarily low-income with insecure&#13;
employment, and cannot afford to consume services as now provided. The Dre-&#13;
sent standard of urban services provision excludes the majority of residents&#13;
and liimits'their own productivity as a result of the poor conditions in which&#13;
they live.&#13;
126.      In order to overcome this situation, the governments must experiment&#13;
with cheaper methods of providing services. This experimentation should fol-&#13;
low the Upper Volta experience with the UlnDP-financed Cissin pilot project,&#13;
which eventually became the cornerstone of national policy in this sphere.&#13;
Niger and Mali must review their methods of providing and maintaining water&#13;
supply and drainage to growing capital cities. All of the countries must&#13;
improve the efficiency and administration of the institutions providing these&#13;
services.&#13;
(3) Recover Investment Costs to Permit Financial Replicability&#13;
27.       Another objective of policy must be the recovery of investment costs&#13;
for uirban services. This recovery should come from consumers of the services&#13;
wherever possible, but should be sought in order to 1) reduce subsidies for&#13;
urban consumption, and 2) eliminate financial constraints to replication. The&#13;
present system, whereby services reach a small number of people who are not&#13;
obliged to pay for them, cannot expand unless cost recovery becomes a major&#13;
objective in the sector. Resolution of this problem is related to the imple-&#13;
mentation of effective systems of munic-ipal taxation, including assessment&#13;
and collection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
(4) Strengthen National and Municipal Institutions to Peform&#13;
Urban Management Functions&#13;
128.      None of the above objectives can be achieved unless the Sahelian&#13;
governments make serious attempts to strengthen the institutions working in&#13;
the urban sector, specifically the Departments of Town-Planning within the&#13;
Ministries of Public Works in each country and the municipalities. The&#13;
Departments of Town-Planning in these countries have been under-staffed and&#13;
insufficiently financed to permit the execution of their legal responsibili-&#13;
ties. The municipalities have been allowed to decline, within the strict&#13;
control of the Ministries of Interior under the French municipal law of 1884,&#13;
which still serves as the basic legislation determining municipal administra-&#13;
tion and government in the Sahel. This condition must be reversed through&#13;
increased financial autonomy for local governments, training of staff,&#13;
and a clearer definition of the municipal jurisdictions. The latter are&#13;
unclear, being mixed with traditional tribal law, procedures for land regis-&#13;
tration, and national governments' unwilling to permit decentralized deci-&#13;
sion-making, even in the capital cities...&#13;
(5) Stimulate Community Participation in Urban Development Programs&#13;
129.      Given the financial and institutional weakness of the public sector&#13;
in the Sahelian countries, it is imperative that programs be designed which&#13;
stimulate greater community participation in the financing and delivery of&#13;
urban services. Self-help programs, incentives to the private sector, and&#13;
the use of community organizations such as caisses populaires in Upper Volta&#13;
or ethnic and religious organizations in Senegal must be encouraged in&#13;
order to generate increasing activity and interest by the urban populations.&#13;
(6) Develop Economic and Institutional Links&#13;
Between the Urban and Rural Sectors&#13;
130.      Finally, as part of the economic diversification of the urban&#13;
economies, efforts must be made to develop economic and institutional links&#13;
between urban centers and rural areas. These links include the urban produc-&#13;
tion and provision of goods and services needed to support rural development,&#13;
such as manufacturing of farm implements, repair centers for agricultural&#13;
machinery, processing of rural products, and many other such activities. This&#13;
approach involves increasing attention and investment resources devoted to the&#13;
development of secondary urban centers, including both infrastructure and&#13;
services, in order to permit the towns to perform needed functions.&#13;
B.   Phase I:  Strategy for the Short Term&#13;
131.      The short-term strategy for urban development in the Sahel should&#13;
focus on the design and execution of urban development projects which estab-&#13;
lish clear precedents in the provision of urban services. These precedents&#13;
should include the reduction of consumer subsidies, emphasis on recovery of&#13;
investment costs, use of low-cost methods of service provision, and efforts to&#13;
reach the majority of urban residents who have low incomes. These policy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
precedents represent new approaches for countries such as Chad, Mali,&#13;
Mauritania, and Niger. Senegal and Upper Volta have attempted pilot schemes,&#13;
with Upper Volta emphasizing these policy reforms much more seriously than&#13;
Senegal, which has added social dimensions to its earlier slum clearance&#13;
policies in Dakar. In all the countries, these projects should emphasize&#13;
the strengthening of institutions in the urban sector, particularly munici-&#13;
palities, in order to allow for the gradual extension of this program on a&#13;
self-replicating basis. This institutional support should include training&#13;
of personnel in essential services such as environmental sanitation and&#13;
maintenance.&#13;
132.      The strategy requires a Governmental review of present policies&#13;
towards provision of services and some estimate, as suggested by the demo-&#13;
graphic evidence presented earlier, of the likely demand for services in&#13;
the medium term. This analysis would forcefully demonstrate not only that&#13;
present services are heavily subsidized, but that such financial commitments&#13;
by the public sector cannot be maintained over time, unless there is massive&#13;
external assistance earmarked for this purpose. It is unlikely, however,&#13;
that such aid will be forthcoming for the urban sector in Sahelian countries,&#13;
where rural deprivation has attracted donor attention.&#13;
133.      Once this policy review is concluded, the Governments should develop&#13;
a program to initiate pilot schemes in service provision, such as the Cissin&#13;
project or the UNDP school construction project in Chad, in order to gain more&#13;
experience with alternative low-cost approaches to services problems. These&#13;
pilot projects should be expanded as quickly as possible into programs which&#13;
are timpact-intensive", i.e., they have the broadest impact possible on urban&#13;
living conditions, yet use only a limited quantity of administrative capacity.&#13;
The extension of water distribution systems into squatter areas is a good&#13;
example of such "impact-intensive" interventions. These will demonstrate the4r&#13;
effectiveness relatively quickly and generate some political support for this&#13;
new policy approach, at least from those urban residents who have not hereto-&#13;
fore received urban services.&#13;
134.      At the same time that such projects are being undertaken ,n the&#13;
capital cities and one or two secondary centers, an effort should be made to&#13;
develop a better understanding of the economies and living conditions of&#13;
secondary towns. This understanding should focus on how the towns can better&#13;
serve their rural hinterlands, while providing services on an unsubsidized&#13;
basis to their own urban populations.&#13;
135.      While the approach to secondary centers in the first phase would be&#13;
ocused on developing the above understanding, this learning experience can&#13;
be most fruitful if some small investment projects are attempted in these&#13;
centers. These projects should seek to follow the policy lines proposed&#13;
earlier for the capital cities, yet because of lower average incomes and&#13;
weaker implementation capacity be more modest in their impact.  Attention&#13;
should be directed towards developing non-farm employment programs in these&#13;
towns Fsd linking them to rural development efforts in the surrounding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
regions. These projects would be explicitly experimental in nature, esseTtial-&#13;
ly researh and development efforts, in order to develop a basis for larger&#13;
scale programs in secondary towns in Phase II or the medium term. Current&#13;
research by the ILO on the employment prospects in secondary centers should&#13;
be used in the design of these experimental projects.&#13;
C. Phase II: Strategy for the Medium Term&#13;
136.      Building upon the projects designed and implemented in Phase I, the&#13;
strategy to be followed in the medium term of five to ten years is the&#13;
development of an urban investment program for secondary centers in each of&#13;
the six countries. This investment program should be carefully worked out&#13;
and designed to establish a system of secondary centers which responds to&#13;
the projected needs of rural areas and regional development over the long&#13;
term. The projected sizes, functions, activities, and locations of these&#13;
towns should be based on a national spatial development strategy which focuses&#13;
investment in geographical areas with the highest economic potential. This&#13;
strategy would require an economic analysis of the comparative advantage of&#13;
different regions within countries, but also for the entire Sahelian region in&#13;
terms of its relation to the coastal countries. Given the low level of&#13;
urbanization of the Sahelian countries and, with the exception of Senegal, the&#13;
lack of a well-developed system of secondary urban centers, this analysis and&#13;
investment program would be planning the future development of the country.&#13;
Urban development would thus be an integral part of that planning, in terms&#13;
of the functional role to be played by urban centers in the implementation of&#13;
the national development strategy. This stands in marked contrast to the&#13;
"parasitic cities" of Hoselitz or the "urban bias" criticized by Lipton and&#13;
many others. It should also take into account the endowment of natural&#13;
resources of each country, and, if sensitively done, could program rural&#13;
development in such a way as to avoid the destruction of lands for farming and&#13;
livestock which resulted from over-intensive utilization in the past two&#13;
decades.&#13;
137.      While this Phase II strategy might be characterized initially as an&#13;
urban investment strategy, its objective would be explicitly to create loci&#13;
of infrastructure and services needed to improve rural productivity. The&#13;
towns to be developed could provide services such as marketing, processing,&#13;
storage, repairs, and extension for rural farmers. They could also serve as&#13;
commercial centers for farmers desiring to use their increased incomes to&#13;
purchase a wider range of goods and services than are available in present-&#13;
day villages. These commercial outlets could thus provide incentives for&#13;
increased rural production. The employment base of the towns, however, would&#13;
be oriented towards the rural sector and should not attract large waves of&#13;
migrants from the surrounding rural hinterland.&#13;
138.      While the proposed emphasis on secondary towns has long been a&#13;
subject of discussion among development planners, geographers, and project&#13;
designers, it has rarely been followed in a carefully worked out manner. Too&#13;
often, the rapid growth of secondary centers has forced planners to treat&#13;
these centers much as if they were already primate cities, or as "capital&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
cities'" as discussed earlier. Experiments such as the Lachish Regional&#13;
Development Program in Israel or the Southwest in the Ivory Coast, to name&#13;
only two, suggest that, if urban centers are not already well-institution-&#13;
alized, i.e., the economic and political interests are not already entrenched,&#13;
a network of towns can be planned which can permit the performance of functions&#13;
which support rural development. The prerequisite to such achievements, how-&#13;
ever, is a well-formulated strategy, rooted in existing conditions. Financial&#13;
and human resources may not be immediately available, but in the case of the&#13;
Sahel, development finance is not likely to be a major constraint over the&#13;
next decade, given donor interest in assisting the so-called "least developed&#13;
countries."&#13;
D.   Overcoming Constraints to Strategy Implementation&#13;
139.      Having proposed elements of a strategy for the development of the&#13;
urban sector in the Sahelian countries, it is now important to identify the&#13;
major constraints on implementation and to suggest how these constraints&#13;
can be overcome. The following constraints will be discussed below: 1)&#13;
political will, 2) difficulty of eliminating subsidies, 3) recovery of costs&#13;
for investments in urban centers, 4) technical capacity in the public sector,&#13;
and 5) limited analytic-operational understanding of the role of secondary&#13;
urban cente,rs.&#13;
1.   Political Will&#13;
140.      This paper has suggested on many occasions that urban centers have&#13;
benefitted from a disproportionate share of the available resources in the&#13;
Sahelian countries. The proposed strategy seeks to redress this distribution&#13;
through a phased approach to urban development which will decrease the pre-&#13;
eminence of the capital cities and seek a more equitable spatial distribution&#13;
of resources and opportunities. Within cities, the strategy proposes more&#13;
emphasis on low-income groups who make up the vast majority of urban popula-&#13;
tion and who have heretofore been relatively ignored in the distribution of&#13;
urban services. These arguments are made on both equity and efficiency&#13;
grounds: present distribution patterns are not equitable within the countries&#13;
nor within the city boundaries. The absence of urban services for potentially&#13;
productive urban households limits their productivity and income and ultimately&#13;
reduces the economic utility of the urban sector for the country as a whole.&#13;
Urban primacy also tends to overconcentrate resources in specific locations&#13;
where they are not always used to their full capacity. Within rural countries&#13;
these resources are also not serving to support the primary economic work of&#13;
the nation: rural development. This urban sector strategy, therefore, calls&#13;
for a new view of town-countryside relationships and the end of urban bias&#13;
and privilege.&#13;
141.      It must also be understood that the present urban bias has not&#13;
come about on its own or randomly. Rather, urban bias has resulted from an&#13;
almost systematic skewing of resource allocation towards the population&#13;
which is politically most vocal and therefore needed by the governing elites.&#13;
Governments which seek to change these patterns will face political opposition,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
regardless of the equity or efficiency arguments which are used to justify&#13;
the new policies. Unions will object to changes in the national wage legis-&#13;
lation, citizens' associations will object to water charges where none&#13;
existed before, and many other demonstrations of opposition will occur within&#13;
the capital cities. The problem, therefore, for the Sahelian governments,&#13;
recognizing both their own political imperatives and the need to use cities&#13;
productively within the national development strategies, is how to combine&#13;
acts of political courage within a phased approach to policy change over&#13;
the short and medium term. Politically, all of the changes simply cannot&#13;
come at the same time. Yet, in accepting this perspective, the governments&#13;
must be prepared to develop limited initiatives on several fronts simulta-&#13;
neously. These initiatives should be packaged to spread around the benefits&#13;
of programs, reaching the largest number of people possible. This "impact-&#13;
intensive" approach will generate political support and hopefully permit&#13;
continued advances in the strategy. One example of such packaging would be&#13;
the coupling of upgrading squatter neighborhoods with a larger city-wide&#13;
program of environmental sanitation. This links improvements for the poor&#13;
with improvements for the entire urban population and may be a necessary&#13;
approach to building political coalitions for urban policy change.&#13;
142.      While the conditions in individual countries will vary substanti-&#13;
ally, it is clear that political will is the major obstacle to overcome in&#13;
implementation of the proposed strategy. This obstacle must be approached&#13;
creatively, bringing together a careful analysis of who will benefit -&#13;
spatially, economically, socially, and politically - from each policy and&#13;
program. Such analysis should suggest the appropriate strategy to be followed&#13;
in each country.&#13;
2.   The Difficulty of Eliminating Subsidies&#13;
143.      The issue of subsidies is central to this analysis.  While subsidies&#13;
have been criticized on equity and efficiency grounds in the paper - parti-&#13;
cularly as a major instrument in the perpetuation of cities as enclaves of&#13;
privilege in the world's poorest countries - subsidies must also be considered&#13;
from the perspective of the public sector providing services which the&#13;
impoverished Sahelian populations are unable to afford. First, it is evident&#13;
that subsidies to the middle class must be reduced over time. As suggested&#13;
in the previous section, this will be politically difficult, yet is central&#13;
to the productive evolution of the urban sector in rural countries. Secondly,&#13;
however, it is less clear how present subsidies to the poorest segments of&#13;
the urban population should be viewed. While these households should pay for&#13;
drinking water, as they do in Upper Volta but not in Mali or Niger, they may&#13;
be unable to pay for other expensive, major improvements in health and environ-&#13;
mental sanitation. This dilemma is well-illustrated by the costs of removing&#13;
major health hazards such as the Zogona Gulley in Ouagadougou, refurbishing&#13;
the drainage canals in Bamako or Niamey, or finding adequate, sanitary means&#13;
of stormwater drainage and waste disposal in N'Djamena. These improvements&#13;
are needed for the health of the entire population of these cities, yet the&#13;
poor, who are frequently the most direct beneficiaries of such investments, are&#13;
unable to pay the costs. Without such investments, the poor health and low&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
productivity of these populations will continue the unbroken cycle of urban&#13;
poverty found in these towns. The dil.a is clear: at certain levels&#13;
of deprivation, such as is found in the Sahelian countries, some investments&#13;
in urban services must be subsidized for the poorer groups in the population&#13;
in order to permit economic and social self-improvement. This suggests that&#13;
the application of the principle that all subsidies should be eliminated&#13;
must be flexible and take into account the actual capacity to pay of the&#13;
population concerned.&#13;
3.   Recovery of Costs of Urban l_vestuents&#13;
144.      The previous section suggests a practical problem in trying to&#13;
recover costs from households who cannot afford justified investments in their&#13;
behalf. The problem of cost recovery is also difficult in the Sahelian&#13;
context because few institutions have experience in collecting charges from&#13;
the urban population. This applies to municipalities who do not collect&#13;
municipal taxes, water companies which, with a few exceptions, do not collect&#13;
water charges, and schools which do not collect school fees. The history of&#13;
service provision, first under the colonial administrations, and later in the&#13;
immediate post-independence period, has been one of "handouts" rather than&#13;
community participation in fiuancing services. A major attitudinal problem&#13;
thus exists when institutions attempt to collect the costs of their services.&#13;
145.      In this situation, a major constraint to cost recovery is the&#13;
weakness of lo_al institutions in performing this function.  Municipalities&#13;
are not organized to do it and would prefer to receive national government&#13;
subsidies to cover annual deficits. The water company in Bamako is in a&#13;
similar situation.  It will therefore be necessary to reorganize these insti-&#13;
tutions to take on these tasks. Adequate performance, however, cannot be&#13;
achieved overnight, but will come only through continued improvement of&#13;
procedures and training of staff. Institutional support will therefore be&#13;
a critic-al component for the implementation of an urban development strategy&#13;
in these countries.&#13;
4.   Technical CaRacity in the Public Sector&#13;
146.      All of the above constraints or obstacles are compounded by the lack&#13;
of technical capacity in most of the national and municipal institutions in&#13;
these countries. There are very few trained and experienced staff in urban-&#13;
related disciplines such as architecture, planning, municipal engineering,&#13;
financial analysis, and neighborhood development. Outmoded procedures of&#13;
municipal administration, based on the French municipal law of 1884, continue&#13;
to weigh heavily on newly-recruited staff, making it difficult if not impos-&#13;
sible foir an "African administration" in process and content to develop.&#13;
On-the-ground training is needed at every level in these institutions if they&#13;
are to perform their legal responsibilities. Without such training, the&#13;
proposed strategy has no chance of succeeding.&#13;

E.   Limited Analytic-Op.ratipnal Understanding of&#13;
the Role of Secondary Urban Centers&#13;
147.      This paper has atteapted to present parts of an argument for using&#13;
secondary urban centers as a tool for stimulating rural development in essenti-&#13;
ally rural countries. It would be presumptuous to believe that this paper&#13;
has offered very much except perhaps in suggesting that more work must be&#13;
done on the role of secondary centers, not descriptively, but prescriptively.&#13;
The gaps in understanding this process are very large, in fact, they are so&#13;
large that it may be difficult to make the argument effectively to decision-&#13;
makers that they should allocate resources according to the proposed strategy.&#13;
This limited understanding, therefore, may in itself be a constraint to&#13;
carrying out the strategy, first in obtaining the necessary support, but&#13;
later in undertaking meaningful programs without wasting scarce resources.&#13;
A first priority, therefore, is the development of a serious inter-sectoral&#13;
program to evaluate the role of secondary centers in this process.&#13;

The projections of urban population are based upon figures provided&#13;
by each government after general census or sample surveys.&#13;
The definition of Sahelian "urban" is not explicit and thu* nct&#13;
comparable across countries:&#13;
- for Senegal "urban" includes the region of Cap Vart, and ehe the3&#13;
of Saint Louis, Thies, Diourbel, Kaolacks aned Zinguichor.&#13;

2.  The SCET  eport&#13;
The SCET report assumes that the present rate of growth of the total&#13;
population will not change drastically within the 1975 to 2000 time periodc&#13;
However, many factors will influence the location of population:&#13;
- future economic polUciea,&#13;
- different types of regional planning,&#13;
- world food prices. etc..&#13;
The areas most sensitive to those policie are the capital cities and&#13;
the low productivity agricultural regions. Two kinds of settlement are considered&amp;&#13;
capital cities and rural settlemats. Three scenarios have been proposed.&#13;
lot Scenario:&#13;
It is a projection of the pre-drought tendencies. They lead to&#13;
- the migration of 1,500,000 out of the Sahel,&#13;
- internal migration from low productivity areas to areas of higher&#13;
productivity (movement toward the South).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- Il0-&#13;
2nd Scenario:&#13;
It is the anticipation of the polarization of population&#13;
-- toward the exterior with an out-migration of 3,500,000 toward the&#13;
coastal areas,&#13;
- in the capital cities whose population would be double the popu-&#13;
lation forecast in Scenario I and the out-migration from low&#13;
productivity zones would be higher than in Scenario I.&#13;
3rd Scenario:&#13;
Stability of the rural areas is the main assumption&#13;
-- low out-migration from the Sahel,&#13;
-- lower growth of the capital cities,&#13;
higher migration toward the southern more productive areas.&#13;
I;n general the demographic projections precede the economic projec-&#13;
tions. Agricultural production i8 estimated assuming that the food consumption&#13;
Of the capital cities will be higher than in the rural areas and qualitatively&#13;
different gfor example, consumption of rice instead of sorghum and of beef&#13;
rather than goat meat). Projections of food consumption are plotted against&#13;
the possibiLlities of cultivation in the rural areas.&#13;
3.  -he  *ossenl2pStud&#13;
Mhe growth rate of the total population of the Sahellan countries&#13;
based upan a studu of the Service de le Cooperation de V214SEE (Department of&#13;
Foreign ti  ozf the French National Institute for Statistics and Economics).&#13;
Tais study divided West Africa into two groups of countries, twelve and three9&#13;

lMo explanation is given in the paper on the methodology used for pro-&#13;
Jecting the growth rate of the urbau population.  The urban population is&#13;
di ided according tc city size.&#13;
sohe urbani population includes those liv.ing in towns over 10,000, wxkie&#13;
the semi-uibani population includes those living in towns betweer 5,000 and&#13;
10000.&#13;

            Urban growth economic development in the Sahel
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The urban population of the Sahel is
            expected to triple between 1975 and 200; an addition of 8
            million people, at least half of them migrants. Present
            conditions are inadequate to absorb such an increase. The
            majority of urban residents rely directly or indirectly on
            government employment, which has been the major stimulus for
            urban growth, but in future is highly unlikely to expand
            rapidly. There are serious constraints on the large-scale
            expansion of industry. It is urgently necessary to stimulate
            employment in the informal sector, with particular attention
            to the processing of agricultural products. The majority of
            urban dwellers have low levels of services, largely
            reflectinga lack of coherent policies toward urban growth.
            Widening the availability of services will involve using
            lower cost standards for new facilities, and recovering
            costs from the urban population at all income levels. Urban
            sector analysis, within macro-economic planning, needs to
            identify and encourage activities in secondary towns which
            will support rural development.
