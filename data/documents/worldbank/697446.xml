VILLAGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT FOR JAVA&#13;
Loan and Project Sunumary&#13;
Borrower:            The Republic of Indonesia&#13;
Beneficiaries:       1,200 poor villages on Java with some 3 million people&#13;
Amount:              $72.5 million equivalent&#13;
Terms:               Repayable in 20 years including five years of grace, at the Bank's&#13;
standard variable interest rate.&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
and Description:     The proposed project aims at providing public infrastructure and&#13;
employment in 1,200 villages, the bottom 20% of the poorest or 6%&#13;
of all rural villages on Java. It includes a 2-3 year pilot program to&#13;
increase government decentralization, transparency and village&#13;
participation. Main features are: a) empowering villagers to decide,&#13;
with some economic criteria, priority uses of the village grant under the&#13;
project; b) creation of jobs paid in cash for poor villagers, especially&#13;
in periods of underemployment; c) development of skills for&#13;
constructing small public works--engineering assistance would be&#13;
provided to villagers to help with subproject design and achieving good&#13;
quality works; d) channelling of village grants through subdistrict&#13;
branches of Bank Rakyat Indonesia; e) mobilization of local&#13;
contributions for the works; and f) a monitoring program to review&#13;
progress while the project is underway and overall results, expost.&#13;
(OECF is helping finance an infrastructure project for poor villages off-&#13;
Java).&#13;
Benefits and Risks:  The project villages comprise on average more than 2600 persons,&#13;
some 3 million in total. With incomes around $1 per day, benefits&#13;
from the creation of jobs and monetary liquidity are important and&#13;
could lead to higher standards of living; some 2,000,000 job-months&#13;
might be created and the project could set a precedent for more labor&#13;
intensive works in future public programs. Economic returns to the&#13;
project infrastructure are expected to be high: currently many poor&#13;
villages are cut-off during the rainy season, making access to services,&#13;
markets and jobs difficult, while they lack water in the dry season; the&#13;
project would help overcome these constraints. Provision of other&#13;
small infrastructures chosen by the villagers would also have high&#13;
returns given that to be chosen the works have priority. A risk is a&#13;
lower absorptive capacity than expected, that could delay project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ii -&#13;
implementation; for this event the project includes contingencies for&#13;
extending technical assistance services.  Another risk is improper&#13;
maintenance of assets to be created; under the project arrangements&#13;
would be agreed for subsequent maintenance, which should be a prime&#13;
concern to villagers for sustainability of benefits from the&#13;
infrastructures. A third risk is diversion of funds, but it should be low&#13;
as several layers of agencies are avoided and various monitoring&#13;
systems are introduced in the project.&#13;

VILLAGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT FOR JAVA&#13;
1. PROJECT BACKGROUND&#13;
A. POVERTY TRENDS&#13;
1.1        Indonesia has been successful in reducing the incidence of absolute poverty. The percentage&#13;
of the population living at or below the absolute poverty level was reduced from some 40% in 1976 to&#13;
some 15% in 1990. However, in view of the large population, about 185 million, the number of absolute&#13;
poor remains high: some 27 million people. These estimates result with an absolute poverty line defined&#13;
as enabling personal intakes of 2100 calories per day and minimum non-food necessities. Poverty&#13;
incidence is sensitive to the definition used, as many people still are just above the absolute line and&#13;
would be categorized as poor with less stringent standards. (Besides, there are many difficulties in&#13;
measuring poverty--identifying and imputing values to non-traded goods, considering price level&#13;
differentials across locations; identifying differing needs by location, type of employment, age, public&#13;
infrastructure availability, etc.; identifying pockets of poverty not apparent to outsiders from statistical&#13;
averages for larger areas, and so on.) The average disposable household income is only about a dollar&#13;
per day per person, even though the average GNP per capita has steadily grown to about $730 equivalent.&#13;
1.2        There is no doubt that poverty is an important rural problem. Poverty reduction has been&#13;
most remarkable in rural areas, but still, some 18 million poor remain in rural areas, many on marginal&#13;
lands, uphill, water scarce or remote areas, or fishing villages, or areas too densely populated to enable&#13;
a living from the resulting small farms, while alternative sources of income are still scant. Rapid&#13;
urbanization has absorbed many rural poor and even so the estimated number of urban poor has decreased&#13;
somewhat, to some 9 million in 1990. These numbers reflect a relatively similar urban and rural absolute&#13;
poverty incidence; other data, such as on infant mortality, suggest that the rural poverty incidence may&#13;
be higher and the urban, lower, emphasizing the problem in rural areas.&#13;
1.3        Java, with a population of 107 million of which only some 36% in urban areas (in 1990),&#13;
has one of the highest population densities in the world, of about 8 persons per hectare (Java has some&#13;
55% of Indonesia's population on only some 7% of the country's land area). In line with its share of&#13;
the population, Java has the most poor, some 55% of the total, more than 15 million (of the total number&#13;
of poor Sumatra comprises 19 % or some 5 million, Kalimantan 8 %, Sulawesi 5 %, Bali 1 %, and the other&#13;
islands, 1-3%; these shares are lower even though poverty incidences are higher in some outer island&#13;
provinces than on Java). Of Java's absolute poor, some 9 million live in rural villages.&#13;
1.4        The Bank has prepared two reviews of the poverty situation in Indonesia: "Strategy for a&#13;
Sustained Reduction in Poverty", in 1990, and "Public Expenditures, Prices and the Poor", in 1993. The&#13;
latter report has been an input to the Government's current poverty programs, on which this proposed&#13;
project also builds on.&#13;
B. PAST AND ONGOING POVERTY RELATED PROGRAMS&#13;
1.5        No doubt steady economic growth, of 6% per year over more than a decade by now, has&#13;
been a main contributor to poverty reduction in Indonesia. In addition to growth, government goals&#13;
included--and continue to include--stability and equity. As part of its policy the Government emphasized&#13;
regional development programs, with focus on agriculture and food self-sufficiency; socially oriented&#13;
programs, such as universal primary education, family planning, community health and nutrition; public&#13;
infrastructure development, including water supply, roads, electricity; village development programs,&#13;
credit programs, and more. The programs aimed at providing basic levels of services for all, and were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
funded yearly through the central government budgets; international agencies provided assistance to some&#13;
of the programs. Given the overall low income levels prevailing, the Government did not generally try&#13;
to "target" the poor; also, given the overall low technical skills, the Government kept most planning and&#13;
implementation in central agencies. While steps are being taken to improve planning and implementation&#13;
of supply driven, basic standards, types of public programs that continue to be much needed, also, as&#13;
both incomes and income differentials have increased, new programs are increasingly targeted--such as&#13;
urban poverty, kampung improvement programs (KIP), the integrated area development schemes (PKT')-&#13;
-and increasingly developed and implemented with local level agencies and community participation.&#13;
Recent improvements in the national household socioeconomic survey (SUSENAS), incorporating&#13;
indicators of access to social services as well as consumption levels and representative at district level--&#13;
earlier smaller sampling made results representative only at provincial level--will allow better design and&#13;
monitoring of targeted programs.&#13;
1.6        The Government has made further poverty reduction one of its main objectives in the Five&#13;
Year Plan (Repelita VI) that started in April 1994. It is concerned that the number of poor remains large&#13;
and wants to accelerate the process of reducing poverty; it aims at decreasing poverty incidence to 6%,&#13;
less than 15 million persons, by the year 2000. The instruments foreseen to achieve this objective are&#13;
an outward oriented, labor-intensive based economic growth (expected to generate more than 2 million&#13;
new jobs per year), human resource development (especially expanded education and health programs),&#13;
and a new program targeted to poor villages (IDT, literally, villages left behind) as it fears that traditional&#13;
public programs may continue to bypass those most in need and are taking too long in being&#13;
implemented. and then, not always to desired standards and cost levels.&#13;
1.7        The Government launched its new IDT program, the Inpres Desa Tertinggal, in April 1994.&#13;
It is funded domestically with $200 million equivalent per year for three years. This pilot program is&#13;
innovative in many ways. It is targeted to more than 20,000 poor villages (see para. 1.8) that each&#13;
received some $10,000 equivalent seed capital, for the poorer villagers. The poor get access to working&#13;
capital, at low cost and in a simple and transparent way. Standard government agencies are bypassed but&#13;
"facilitators" (community workers) paid by the Government are available to assist villagers in&#13;
understanding the program, that has been widely publicised, and in defining "projects". Community self-&#13;
help groups (POKMAS) including women's groups (PKK) are central to the IDT process. The villagers&#13;
agree on who should be the beneficiaries of the funds, based on (low) incomes and proposed (productive)&#13;
uses of the funds; the beneficiaries have to repay the "village", as the funds are intended to become a&#13;
revolving fund for others to use subsequently. The subdistrict bank unit receives the grant from the&#13;
Government in a village account and disburses against a minimum of documentation to the village head&#13;
and the beneficiaries, and forwards records to the Government. The village heads also have to keep&#13;
records of beneficiaries and activities pursued, repayments, etc., records that are consolidated at the&#13;
provincial level and forwarded to Jakarta. IDT results so far are positive. Selected villagers surveyed&#13;
say they value the initiative and villages not included in the program question the selection method.&#13;
Funds are being used carefully--some villagers on Java bought cattle; the designated beneficiaries are able&#13;
to pay for the animal some months later by selling the offspring. Others bought sewing machines,&#13;
weaving materials, and so on. Some misappropriations of funds by officials were reported, some of them&#13;
via the P.O. Complaints Box 5000, that is well known to the Indonesian population. Unusually strong&#13;
action--dismissal--was taken against identified offenders, that should discourage improper conduct.&#13;
1.8        The selection of villages for the 1994 IDT program was made by the Planning Ministry&#13;
(BAPPENAS) and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA) based on the 1993 PODES socio-economic&#13;
1  GOI's area development scheme (PKT) was undertaken during 1989-93 and covered for one year each a total of&#13;
7,900 villages, nmainly for public infrastructure provision with village participation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
survey by the Bureau of Statistics, that considered three basic indicators: village facilities and potential&#13;
(10 variables), housing and the environment (8 variables) and population characteristics (9 variables).&#13;
Of the 65,554 villages in Indonesia, 20,633 had at least 2 of the 3 indicators below the set poverty&#13;
threshold and were thus defined as "poor". The large majority of these poor villages, 19,625, is "rural",&#13;
and 14,117 of the rural poor villages are outside Java-Bali. The population of the poor villages is 33&#13;
million, of which 18 million (55%) are in Java-Bali as the village size there (average 3,000 persons) is&#13;
3 times the average village size elsewhere; the percentage is in line with the proportion of the poor in&#13;
Java according to surveys of household expenditure (SUSENAS). The initial village selection had some&#13;
flaws for identifying consumption levels--for instance, too much weight was given to infrastructure&#13;
deficiencies that do not always reflect lowest consumption levels--and thus the selection for the 1995&#13;
program gave more prominence to expenditure levels; furthermore, villages in the 1994 program with&#13;
less than 500 residents will not receive further IDT allocations. As a result almost a third of the villages&#13;
selected changed for the 1995 program.&#13;
1.9        Central government transfers to local levels will continue to be important for equity&#13;
objectives, because the central government has most tax bases (oil, gas, import duties, etc.). Most&#13;
transfer categories are based on equal amounts per capita, per jurisdiction and per area size of the&#13;
jurisdictions. Many of the transfers are earmarked for specific uses, such as civil service salaries, but&#13;
one of Repelita VI's aims is furthering decentralization of functions, increasing participation in decision&#13;
making at local levels, and increasing targeting of programs by type and by region. As an example, as&#13;
of 1994 the INPRES for roads was discontinued and the amount was included in the INPRES block grant&#13;
that provides, rightly, increased flexibility in the use of funds at the local level. Decentralization will&#13;
continue as local agencies become more able; the central agencies are overwhelmed by the workloads&#13;
imposed by growing budgets and complexity that often result in delaying program implementation&#13;
unnecessarily. The FY1994/95 budget for regional development was Rp.5,340 billion, comprising&#13;
Rp.423 billion in transfers to villages (only Rp.6 million per village), transfers to kabupatens of Rp.2,418&#13;
billion (of which Rp.968 billion for roads), transfers to provinces of Rp.1,219 billion, subsidies to&#13;
primary schools of Rp.498 billion, subsidies to health centers of Rp.393 billion, and the IDT program&#13;
with Rp.389 billion. At the same time, local revenue efforts are promoted as local needs exceed available&#13;
budgets.&#13;
1.10       Given some evidence that incomes in rural areas are negatively affected by regulations and&#13;
practices restricting local trade and transport, the Government also endeavors to reduce such non-physical&#13;
restrictions. In the past, Government reform programs have tended to focus on external trade or centrally&#13;
visible constraints and less on what may seem smaller local level impediments, that however can have&#13;
a significant impact on farmgate price levels. Financing was made available under the Technical&#13;
Assistance Project (Loan 3385-IND) to identify non-infrastructure constraints to trade and transport and&#13;
help define an improvement action program for the rural areas. Study results were taken into account&#13;
for preparing a Government Action Plan, intended to reduce levies imposed on transporters at the district&#13;
level and to provide more information on producer prices to farmers (Annex 4).  As part of its&#13;
decentralization policy, the Government proposes to implement the Action Plan in parallel to the proposed&#13;
project.&#13;
C. RuRAL INFRASTRUCTURE&#13;
1.11       The Government has concentrated investment on infrastructure in projects of national,&#13;
provincial and district level importance.  Projects at these levels usually have a large number of&#13;
beneficiaries and high economic returns. In the case of roads, such projects are necessary to improve&#13;
or create basic networks that carry high traffic volumes, and thus normally have priority over subdistrict&#13;
or village access roads. As a result the road network currently comprises some 260,000 km of which&#13;
some 181,000 km of kabupaten roads--but access roads are not well developed, and given heavy rains&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
and difficult terrain and clayish soils in many locations, many villages are cut off during the rainy season.&#13;
Extending the road network to provide all weather though low standard access to villages is now a&#13;
priority, but because of the large number of villages it is costly even if improvements are achieved at&#13;
lowest possible costs. The road subsector already comprises some 20% of the development budget (some&#13;
Rp.5 trillion in FY95, almost as much as the whole regional development budget) and some reallocations&#13;
may be warranted.&#13;
1.12        Infrastructure needs at the subdistrict and village level have been addressed with smaller&#13;
government programs and with self-help. Since Pelita IV, the Government has classified villages in 3&#13;
categories for assistance: the poorest, to which both housing and public infrastructure assistance are&#13;
given; villages with potential, such as rural growth centers that need ad-hoc programs, and villages&#13;
already developing, for which only housing assistance is provided. The Ministry of Home Affairs (and&#13;
until 1993 also the Ministry of Public Works) helps implement the programs. By now about half the&#13;
villages have been provided some assistance; some 3,000/4,000 villages selected at the kabupaten level&#13;
are assisted every year. There have also been special programs such as the integrated area development&#13;
scheme (mentioned in para. 1.5). Currently INPRES provides sorne Rp.50 million per kabupaten for&#13;
village infrastructure. Most work is undertaken by the villagers, without pay or just enough to cover&#13;
some training and food costs, so that more funds are available to purchase inputs, a site engineer, often&#13;
a consultant, is assigned for 2-3 months to a village to help with implementation, if needed. The Army's&#13;
"corps of engineers" equivalent has also been active in improving small village infrastructures. Often&#13;
villagers improve infrastructure by themselves--under the "gotong royong" system all villagers mobilize&#13;
one day to accomplish a chosen task, or each villager is assigned responsibility for completing by a&#13;
certain date a given sub-task, such as improvement of a small road section. But villagers usually cannot&#13;
afford to buy any materials, such as stone, so that despite their efforts results are often of low standards&#13;
and short-lived. Thus, infrastructure service levels remain low. A 1994 study sponsored by OECF&#13;
estimated that providing for basic infrastructure "needs" (access roads, piers, drinking water, sanitation)&#13;
in all the poor Indonesian villages, at Ministry of Public Works unit costs, would cost Rp.2,757 billion.&#13;
1.13        Needs on Java are considerable.  Java has 18,194 villages of which some 6,000 rural&#13;
villages were classified by BPS in 1993 as "left behind", partly due to infrastructure deficiencies--in&#13;
roads, health facilities, schools, telecommunications, water supply, sanitation facilities, markets, waste&#13;
disposal systems. The above mentioned 1994 OECF-financed study estimated that for Java some Rp.312&#13;
billion were needed to provide facilities to 4,300 poor villages--or Rp. 174 billion for the poorest 765&#13;
villages. The report indicates that some 4,200 poor villages need improved access roads, some 2 km on&#13;
average per village, and that some 500 villages do not have clean drinking water. The cost of the needed&#13;
roads, water, piers and sanitation facilities was estimated at some $33,000 average equivalent per village,&#13;
based on MPW unit costs (average unit costs were $16,000 per kilometer of road (including bridge&#13;
needs), $23,000 per water supply scheme and $3,000 per pier). However, the 765 poorest villages have&#13;
costlier needs, being less endowed in infrastructure and normally located in areas of more difficult access;&#13;
their requirements were estimated at some $110,000 average equivalent per village--for an average 4 km&#13;
access road with bridge(s); a water scheme to tap rain, surface or ground water; and 300 piers, on rivers&#13;
or seashores, in 200 of the villages. (Annex 1, Tables 1, 2, 3). Even these needs, prior to including the&#13;
needs for other types of infrastructure, are unlikely to be met with current budgets (para. 1.9); so far&#13;
funds available for localized needs have not increased despite some increased decentralization. However,&#13;
foreign agencies are assisting with several programs.&#13;
D. LESSONS LEARNED IN BANK OPERATIONS&#13;
1.14        Many ongoing Bank projects in Indonesia have components targeted to the poor--health,&#13;
nutrition and family planning; education; agriculture; rural water supply; kabupaten roads; urban projects.&#13;
Most of these projects are implemented by national government agencies and a few district level agencies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
following standard budgetary processes, overheads and budget cycles. Implementation takes normally&#13;
5 or more years; the experience from several projects was reviewed for the proposed project: (a) the&#13;
Bank's 3 ongoing kabupaten road projects, each covering different areas of Indonesia (on Java, only West&#13;
Java), essentially seek to upgrade some 20 km of roads per kabupaten per year and to improve overall&#13;
road maintenance. The implementation record is good in terms of number of kilometers improved, but&#13;
is behind expectations in terms of construction quality, unit costs (especially in Eastern Indonesia) and&#13;
institutional development. The experience of a labor intensive pilot scheme being implemented on Java&#13;
with assistance from ILO under one of the kabupaten road projects was useful for the proposed project;&#13;
(b) the Yogyakarta Upland Area Development Project (Loan 3305-IND, 1992), aims at improving the&#13;
incomes and living standards of upland residents, mainly farmers, on a sustainable basis through better&#13;
resource management. Of interest to this project, is that the Yogyakarta project is also of a participatory&#13;
nature and includes provision of infrastructure, and that the mid-term review in June 1994 revealed road&#13;
and bridge construction to be the most successful component, with physical targets achieved or exceeded&#13;
through considerable local contributions that stretched the project funds, even though cost-effectiveness&#13;
was not considered as good as achievable; (c) under the Water Supply and Sanitation for Low Income&#13;
Communities Project (Loan 3629-IND, 1993) communities should participate in deciding the type of&#13;
service level they want within a village allocation, and have collected contributions to upgrade standards&#13;
of works the allocation could finance; however, the project had a slow start, and it is too early to judge&#13;
results.&#13;
1.15       Experience with locally managed small irrigation works on Java is considered to be good:&#13;
there was grassroot participation in planning, agreement on work details and schedule, and beneficiary&#13;
villagers were usually hired as wage labor for construction. Works were undertaken mainly by small&#13;
contractors; contractor capability for small works is good and competitive. Some works were constructed&#13;
by villagers themselves, based on prevailing unit rates for construction items (not on a wage basis). The&#13;
design was handled entirely by provincial based consultants while overall supervision was by the&#13;
provincial level public agency. The irrigation schemes cost between $10,000 and $60,000 equivalent and&#13;
were on an annual construction basis.  The experience in constructing village roads under rural&#13;
development projects and schools (with INPRES) is similar to that with irrigation schemes. These&#13;
experiences were good examples for the proposed project. The kampung improvement program is similar&#13;
to the proposed project in providing small scale infrastructures and including poverty reduction objectives,&#13;
but it benefits urban neighborhoods rather than rural villages; the program was already successful prior&#13;
to Bank involvement and the Bank's various KIP projects are considered to provide an example of best&#13;
practice.&#13;
1.16       The experience under poverty focused projects in other countries was also reviewed: such&#13;
as that for Sri Lanka and the Social Fund for Guatemala, and the successful Agetip program in Africa--&#13;
under this program a non-profit organization employs small contractors to carry out publicly financed&#13;
works.&#13;
1.17       A general lesson is that for poverty reduction programs, involvement of the intended&#13;
beneficiaries in program design and implementation, and contributions in kind or cash, are essential for&#13;
more relevant subproject choices and sustainability.  Also, multilayered top-down processes and&#13;
centralized approval requirements considerably slow processes down and add to overhead costs; however,&#13;
central criteria and guidelines are useful, as is the availability of technical expertise and advise at the local&#13;
level to improve understanding of choices and quality of implementation. The period of starting up&#13;
activities tends to be longer than planned, and programs need some flexibility in implementation time--&#13;
unless the opportunity cost of their time is nil, people generally need time to choose and commit to a new&#13;
activity, and need some certainty about the sustainability of the initiative. Starting small and expanding&#13;
programs as demand for them increases at each location seems a safe way to proceed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
E. BANK STRATEGY FOR POVERTY REDUCTION&#13;
1.18       The Bank endorses the Government's strategy for poverty reduction in Indonesia (para. 1.6).&#13;
The proposed project is consistent with the 1995 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) that was discussed&#13;
by the Board March 21, 1995. Poverty reduction forms the central basis of almost two-thirds of the&#13;
Bank's lending program through efforts to improve the quality of basic social services, infrastructure&#13;
projects for roads, power transmission and distribution, water supply, agricultural support services and&#13;
research. In order to target the projects better towards the poor, and to increase participation of the poor&#13;
in the design and implementation of these projects, the Bank is increasingly moving away from large,&#13;
national (in coverage), and centrally-managed projects to a multiplicity of smaller, regional and more&#13;
locally-managed projects, such as this proposed one.&#13;
1.19       In line with the 1994 CAS and a Government request, mid-1994 the World Bank made&#13;
financing available under an existing Technical Assistance Project (Loan 3385-IND) to quickly help&#13;
BAPPENAS, the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Bureau of Statistics improve methodologies and&#13;
procedures to better select villages for the 1995 and 1996 IDT programs, and to develop systems to&#13;
monitor/supervise/evaluate the pilot towards improving future programs. Terms of reference for the&#13;
technical assistance were also agreed. However, recruitment of experts was delayed and the Govermment&#13;
did itself further work to improve village selection (para. 1.8). Furthermore, following a Bank request,&#13;
Japan's Policy and Human Resources Development Fund approved in January 1995 a $2 million&#13;
equivalent grant for BAPPENAS to monitor/supervise/evaluate the IDT pilot during 1995-1997, using&#13;
the systems to be developed under the Bank financed study. Experts to help design the monitoring system&#13;
started their assignment early April 1995.&#13;
2. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT ORIGIN AND FORMULATION&#13;
2.1        The 1993 PODES survey helped identify poor villages for the 1994 IDT program; poor&#13;
infrastructure weighed heavily in the selection (para. 1.8). Early 1994 BAPPENAS/OECF engaged&#13;
consultants (Japan Development Institute and PT Intersys Kelola Maju) to survey IDT villages and&#13;
estimate needs for access roads, piers, and drinking water and sanitation, both in physical terms and cost.&#13;
On the basis of the consultant report (para. 1.12), OECF agreed to support an infrastructure project for&#13;
selected poor villages off Java and Bali--implementation of the project started February 1995.&#13;
2.2        The Bank agreed mid-1994 to assist with a pilot village infrastructure project for Java,&#13;
addressed to villages relatively underendowed with small infrastructures such as water supply, access&#13;
roads, drainage, bridges and jetties, markets, etc. Experience under Bank financed projects in Indonesia&#13;
and other countries, information gathered in visits to poor villages, the Javanese traditional ways and&#13;
strong grassroot institutions, were taken into account in the design of the proposed project; the experience&#13;
under the Government's self-financed poverty and infrastructure programs was essential for the adoption&#13;
of the project features that are innovative for the Bank (para.2.6). The project was developed jointly by&#13;
the Bank and the Government. BAPPENAS, in particular its Bureau of Regional District and Rural.&#13;
Development and the IDT Secretariat, suggested the basic approach and coordinated interaction with other&#13;
relevant Ministries, in particular the Directorate General of Regional Development (Bangda) and the&#13;
Directorate General of Village Community Development (PMD) in the Ministry of Home Affairs; the&#13;
Directorate General of Human Settlements (Cipta Karya) and of Roads (Bina Marga) in the Ministry of&#13;
Public Works; and the Ministry of Finance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
2.3         The Government gives high priority to the project as a complement to the IDT program--&#13;
indeed sees it as part of the IDT program. The project is expected to enhance the value of the IDT seed&#13;
capital villagers receive for productive purposes, and implementation will follow the decentralized IDT&#13;
approach--villagers are to select and implement the works that they consider to be of highest priority.&#13;
In December 1994 the Government requested the Bank appraisal to take place as early as possible.&#13;
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.4         The proposed project aims at reducing poverty, providing village infrastructure and&#13;
employment paid in cash, and increasing decentralization, in line with the Government objectives. More&#13;
specifically, the project is a pilot to test in 6% of the Javanese villages--the bottom 20% of the poorest&#13;
villages on Java--the following main objectives, with a view of applying lessons learned to future&#13;
programs:&#13;
a) empowering villagers to decide priority uses of the grant funds available under the project for&#13;
their village, and to implement the works;&#13;
b) providing public infrastructure needed in poor villages;&#13;
c) creating jobs paid in cash for underemployed villagers to construct the public works, especially&#13;
in dry seasons--though fishing villages may differ from farming villages in terms of the best season&#13;
for works;&#13;
d) mobilizing village contributions towards the agreed public works; and&#13;
e) supporting the Government's decentralization policies, including its Action Plan to reduce non-&#13;
infrastructure constraints to trade and transport in the rural areas.&#13;
C. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
2.5        In order to reach the above objectives, the proposed pilot project comprises a 2-3 year&#13;
program to assist some 1200 poor rural villages on Java improve their living standards while building&#13;
public works--such as access roads, bridges, water supply schemes, sanitation facilities, drainage,&#13;
markets, piers or other small infrastructures. The project would help finance (a) village works and&#13;
employment, up to an agreed allocation per village, and (b) technical assistance/engineering services, to&#13;
help with design and implementation of the schemes at the village level and, at the central level, for the&#13;
Project Management Unit (PMU) to coordinate activities, supervise project implementation and monitor&#13;
and evaluate its impact, and if necessary, to help implement its Action Plan (Annex 4).&#13;
2.6         The project is innovative for the Bank in the extent of its decentralization/grassroot&#13;
approach: the villages selected are to decide the works they want and that comply with a simple economic&#13;
criteria; technical assistance is to be provided directly to village groups; financing will be provided&#13;
directly through subdistrict bank units and be delinked from late budget releases. The focus is also on&#13;
employment: villagers doing the work are to be paid cash in proportion to work progress and works are&#13;
to be organized seasonally or as convenient for labor availability. (As mentioned earlier, normally Bank&#13;
infrastructure projects in Indonesia are implemented via government agencies because the works are of&#13;
a large scale and complex; and while so far the Government has had some village programs implemented&#13;
at the subdistrict and even village level, generally district or higher level agencies are fully in charge and&#13;
village laborers are often not paid in cash but expected to contribute "free" labor.) The project modalities&#13;
are described below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
2.7         Selection of poor villages. Among the 18,194 villages on Java, in 1993 the Government&#13;
identified 6039 villages "left behind", or poor, largely based on infrastructure deficiencies (having at least&#13;
2 of 3 indicators below the PODES poverty threshold, para. 1.8). Helping so many villages at once&#13;
would be too daunting a task. The project is to assist some 1200 rural villages, the bottom fifth of the&#13;
identified poor villages including the 765 villages categorized as "extremely poor". The first year&#13;
program includes 415 villages, 120 in West Java, 145 in Central Java, 30 in Yogyakarta and 120 in East&#13;
Java. The IDT Secretariat first identified the kabupatens (districts) in each province with the highest&#13;
concentration of poorest villages: 23 of the 82 kabupaten on Java include about half of the "extremely&#13;
poor" villages. Because of the need to limit the time field engineers spend travelling between villages,&#13;
villages were then selected in clusters of 5, each cluster including at least 3 extremely poor villages. All&#13;
selected villages have populations of at least 700 persons, to justify the infrastructure and the grant level.&#13;
Thereafter, the bupatis (District Heads) of the 23 selected kabupatens (districts), in consultation with&#13;
camats (Subdistrict Heads) confirmed the IDT Secretariat selection, except for some 15 villages for which&#13;
substitutes were proposed and retained in the final village list (Annex 1 and Map).&#13;
2.8         Some 800 other rural villages shall be in the second batch, 200 in West Java, 290 in Central&#13;
Java, 10 in Yogyakarta and 290 in East Java, bringing the total assisted in each province to the proportion&#13;
of poor in each province. More kabupatens will be covered than in the first project year; nevertheless,&#13;
some isolated extremely poor villages may not be included in the project if overhead costs of doing so&#13;
were too high; conversely, some poor villages but not in the lowest quintile, while not getting direct&#13;
assistance would however benefit from access roads and other schemes provided to the poorest adjacent&#13;
villages. The additional 800 villages shall have been identified from the established government list of&#13;
poor villages and ratified by the respective Bupatis by September 1995.  By December 1995 the&#13;
Government and the Bank shall agree on the list of villages for the second year; if following review of&#13;
the first year experience it is decided to proceed slower to ease implementation, then a shorter list will&#13;
be selected for assistance in 1996, leaving the remainder for assistance in 1997. An additional village&#13;
list would also be agreed if the allocation (para. 2.10) turns out to exceed implementable needs of some&#13;
of the 1200 selected poor villages.&#13;
2.9         Early April 1995 and February 1996 (and if the program is extended, February 1997), the&#13;
camats/bupatis have informed/will inform the kepala desas (elected Village Heads) of villages selected&#13;
and provide public information--a circular, radio announcements, etc.--with the rules to be followed under&#13;
the program, so that discussions in the villages selected gets underway.&#13;
2.10        Village grants. Each village allocation under the project should ideally reflect infrastructure&#13;
needs and labor availability. However, for simplicity and transparency, a standard Rp. 120 million (about&#13;
$55,000 equivalent) grant per village is foreseen. This allocation is smaller than the needs of the&#13;
"extremely poor" villages but larger than the average need because some of the project villages are not&#13;
"extremely poor" (para. 1.13); because it is expected that most of the works, especially road works, will&#13;
be implemented with village labor and in surveys villagers have indicated willingness to work for some&#13;
Rp. 2,000/3,000 per day, a lower wage than that included in MPW cost estimates; and also because the&#13;
absorptive capacity to implement labor intensive works would be limited due to logistics involved. If&#13;
some village programs cost less than the allocation, then the balance would be available for more villages&#13;
that would also be selected from the bottom of the government's list of poor villages (para. 2.8). The&#13;
allocations will be recorded in the kabupaten budgets but the funds will be channelled directly to villages&#13;
through the subdistrict units of Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI), outside the standard budget channel. A&#13;
flow chart is included in Annex 3.&#13;
2.11        Selection of public infrastructure subprojects. Kabupaten level staff of PMD (MoHA)&#13;
routinely survey villages about their infrastructure needs and make the results available as a starting point&#13;
for proposals by camats and in turn by bupatis (Bappeda II level) and by provincial governors (Bappeda&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
I level), in the yearly bottom-up planning process for the budget. This planning consultation process will&#13;
be used by the project, but ending essentially at the camat level, in line with current decentralization&#13;
policies and to leave decision-making close to the village level for village works. The kepala desa heads&#13;
the LKMD (village community resilience institution) and leads discussion of village group representatives&#13;
to agree on priorities; IDT program facilitators and other PMD local staff are available to help the&#13;
process. Village proposals are submitted to the camat, for harmonization if necessary at the subdistrict&#13;
level, and agreed programs are further checked to ensure that the proposals are not already covered in&#13;
another, funded program. Subprojects that would normally be included in standard budgets (INPRES)&#13;
and normally larger than those envisaged here, should in principle not be financed under the project.&#13;
Camats endorse the program, subject to a satisfactory technical review by the field engineers (see below);&#13;
the approval should come no later than May 30, 1995 and March 30, 1996 (and 1997 if applicable).&#13;
2.12        Field engineers will assist the LKMDs. Field engineers (consultants) are to review the&#13;
subproject proposals approved by camats, starting as early as possible. They would discuss and make&#13;
modifications as may be needed for technical reasons, and either give their technical (final) approval, or&#13;
if an alternative subproject were selected of a different type and cost estimate, then consult the camat&#13;
again about the alternative. The requirements for approval of a subproject by a field engineer are&#13;
elaborated in the Project Manual; they are listed below and the specifics shall be recorded in each case,&#13;
as follows:&#13;
a) the subproject must be a public infrastructure justified by the number of users and the cost per&#13;
user;&#13;
b) the funding available--the village grant and any village contributions--must be estimated&#13;
sufficient to complete the subproject;&#13;
c) land requirements will be minimized; for any required land or assets that would affect negatively&#13;
a villager's income and require compensation, the village and the affected family would agree on&#13;
a compensation that improved or restored their living standard, income earning or production&#13;
capacity to pre-subproject levels; the field engineer will verify that all persons affected are satisfied&#13;
with the compensation provided and if no agreement is reached, an alternative location or&#13;
subproject will be selected (the field engineer is also to verify that prior to the start of works, all&#13;
persons affected are satisfied with the compensation provided);&#13;
d) implementation/contractual arrangements and number of village laborers must be clear;&#13;
e) approaches to provide subsequent maintenance of the subproject must be agreed, including&#13;
assignment of responsibilities for maintenance works, training for maintenance designees, and&#13;
financing, as necessary.&#13;
2.13       In line with decentralization policies neither the PMU nor the Bank require to approve&#13;
individual subprojects.&#13;
2.14        Engineering assistance. The LKMDs will be the implementing agencies of the project.&#13;
The capacity of district agencies (Dinas PU TklI, DPUK) is rather limited and consultants are already&#13;
needed for some ongoing programs. Therefore the DPUKs have designated "administrative" Pimpros&#13;
for the first project year, and shall designate Pimpros by March 31 every project year, while the project&#13;
provides engineering services to assist directly LKMDs with subproject cost estimation, design,&#13;
procurement, organization and supervision of work, reporting, administration and some training to&#13;
villagers (and perhaps local contractors) for the implementation of the subproject and subsequent&#13;
maintenance, in addition to the initial approval (para. 2.12). It is estimated that I field engineer&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
consultant can assist 5 villages (1 cluster), assuming that each village would implement 1-3 subprojects--a&#13;
total of some 80 engineers for the first year villages and 120 or such number for the second year as may&#13;
be found necessary when the program is agreed. Field engineers would live close to their village cluster&#13;
to reduce travel and would have at least a motorcycle for field visits.&#13;
2.15       In order to provide homogeneity across clusters, an engineering/management team of 4&#13;
senior consultants has initially developed a simple Project Manual including guidelines with engineering&#13;
and environmentally sound standards for small public works, adopted from existing manuals (mainly from&#13;
MPW), simple compensation guidelines, procurement forms, procedures and reporting to be used by&#13;
LKMDs, etc. The senior consultants have also assisted the IDT Secretariat in the selection of field&#13;
engineers, in organizing a workshop for them (that took place in Bandung, April 24-28, 1995) to launch&#13;
the project, and will assist afterwards, in their supervision. The team leader and a counterpart with clear&#13;
responsibilities are based in Jakarta, to assist the PMU in overall management, but are expected to be in&#13;
the field most of their time. The other 3 senior engineers are based one in each province, to be closer&#13;
to the project villages, and are also assigned a counterpart each, from Bappedas I, from the time they&#13;
mobilized. A draft Project Manual and workshop program were reviewed by the Bank in early April&#13;
1995, to enable the workshop to take place by late April 1995. The final draft Project Manual was&#13;
agreed during negotiations, April 18 to 21, 1995; copies of the Manual shall be made widely available.&#13;
2.16       Monitoring assistance  The project also provides for the services of a team of experts to&#13;
assist the PMU monitor project implementation and impacts.  Monitoring will use participatory&#13;
approaches to the extent feasible and will be coordinated with the IDT monitoring efforts. Some non-&#13;
project villages will also be monitored to compare the results of various types of interventions. The terms&#13;
of reference were discussed at negotiations.&#13;
D. PROJECT COSTS AND FiNANCING&#13;
2.17.      The total cost of the project, summarized in Table 2.1, is estimated at Rp.184.2 billion&#13;
($83.8 million equivalent). Technical assistance for implementation support is estimated to cost $11&#13;
million equivalent or about 13% of the project cost. The direct or indirect foreign cost component is&#13;
small, estimated at some 20-30% and accounting for the foreign cost component of technical assistance&#13;
services, including vehicles; equipment depreciation included in contractors' bills; and fuel and asphalt&#13;
costs. Direct labor costs would range from some 50% to 20%, depending on the works, though the share&#13;
of total labor costs (including labor in materials delivered) would be higher. The standard 10% value&#13;
added tax will apply to works by contractors and supplier bills; the total tax amount under the project will&#13;
depend on the proportion of works done by the villages themselves. Increased administration costs are&#13;
included at standard percentages (1% for central Government, 1% for provincial agencies and 3% for&#13;
local level agencies, of the grant amounts). Contingencies have been included for technical assistance&#13;
costs to cover the event of implementation over 3 years rather than 2. Because of the programmatic&#13;
nature, village allocations do not carry contingencies.&#13;
2.18       The Bank loan of $72.5 million equivalent would finance 86.5 % of project costs. The high&#13;
financing percentage is on account of the poverty reduction objectives of the project and the fact that the&#13;
Government is financing other poverty reduction programs on its own. The Government would cover&#13;
10% of the village grants and the increased administration costs. The 10% value added tax on technical&#13;
assistance contracts has been waived in accordance with Kepres 13/95.&#13;

3. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. PROJECT COORDINATION AND MONITORING&#13;
3.1         BAPPENAS, in particular its Bureau of Regional District and Rural Development, will be&#13;
the overall coordinating agency of the project. A Project Management Unit (PMU) has been established&#13;
to oversee implementation and includes representatives of BAPPENAS, the Ministry of Finance, DGs&#13;
Cipta Karya and Bina Marga (MPW) and DGs Bangda and PMD (MoHA). The PMU has a Secretariat&#13;
(IDT Secretariat) established to deal with the Government's IDT poverty program as well as related&#13;
foreign-assisted village infrastructure programs. The IDT Secretariat will be strengthened under the&#13;
project with experts for socio-economic monitoring and the leader of the engineer/management team;&#13;
also, a Japanese Grant will finance a team to monitor the IDT program itself.&#13;
3.2        The IDT Secretariat, with the assistance of experts, would monitor the impact of the&#13;
program in selected villages during implementation and prepare an ex-post evaluation. Monitorers are&#13;
expected to be Indonesian entities such as Universities, NGOs or consultants. Furthermore, the&#13;
monitoring to be done of the IDT program with the grant from the Government of Japan, possibly&#13;
including GIS, will be coordinated with the monitoring of this pilot project, and some villages included&#13;
in other programs or with no program will be monitored as well in order to ascertain differences. Terms&#13;
of reference for the experts were discussed at negotiations and the project monitoring team should be&#13;
selected by about July 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
3.3         Bappedas level I (provincial) have provided counterparts to the senior engineers and will&#13;
monitor information about the project. Bappedas level II will ensure project coordination with other&#13;
government programs.&#13;
B. IMPLEN1ENTATION SCHEDULE&#13;
3.4         To achieve the objectives of the project, to maximize employment for cash of local villagers&#13;
and provision of local public infrastructure, the works should be executed mainly during the dry season,&#13;
from beginning of May to end September, which is when farmers are not fully employed in agricultural&#13;
activities, when conditions are best for construction of public works, and when standard public work&#13;
budgets are not yet released. Therefore, yearly project activities are scheduled around the desired&#13;
implementation season. An optimal yearly schedule is in Annex 5.&#13;
3.5        It is desirable that the subprojects in any village be completed in one year. to curtail the tine&#13;
engineering assistance is needed. However, after the first project year, experience may indicate that a&#13;
village program should be allowed 2 years/seasons for completion--the proposed allocation is substantial&#13;
for many poor villages. A year extension could increase the share of engineering and monitoring costs&#13;
in the project cost, up to some 18%, still considered an acceptable share given that a needed extension&#13;
could allow a larger share of the village grant becoming villagers' incomes and reducing contractors&#13;
shares. However, a longer implementation period may reduce the intensity needed of engineering&#13;
services, thus not increasing their cost. This flexibility is justified given that the project is a pilot and&#13;
lessons should be useful for other programs. Thus, the objective is to complete the project in 2.5 years&#13;
(allowing for ex post evaluation), but it may take 3.5 years.&#13;
C. IMPLEMENTATION OF WORKS&#13;
3.6         LKMDs will be the "implementation agencies" of village subprojects, following agreements&#13;
signed by the camat and field engineer. LKMDs will serve as contractors; they would either employ&#13;
villagers directly and buy materials, rent equipment. etc. or if need be, contract work or expertise with&#13;
local contractors. This procedure has already been used successfully in some cases. Normally the local&#13;
implementing agency is the DPUK but DPUKs generally have limited capabilities and would be unable&#13;
to implement the proposed project with their current staff. Thus, the bupatis will authorize the DPUK&#13;
Pimpros to delegate to the consultant field engineer, and Pimpros assigned to the project will retain an&#13;
administrative role only; where DPUK engineers are able to help they would of course be welcome to&#13;
do so.&#13;
3.7         The field engineers will assist the LKMDs design, cost, plan, implement and supervise&#13;
works and prepare reports. They are to certify payment documentation in accordance with progress of&#13;
work. Field engineers will be trained in project specifics by the central team assisted by staff from&#13;
BAPPENAS, MoHA, MPW and MoF, at a workshop in Bandung prior to deployment. They have the&#13;
Project Manual with guidelines for choice of unit price or lump sum contracts, preparation of bill of&#13;
quantities or set of unit prices (depending on direct labor or subcontract), technical specifications&#13;
including environmental guidelines to be enforced, quality standards, control activities and other aspects.&#13;
Special care is needed in the costing of subprojects given that there are no funds to cover any cost&#13;
overrun beyond the village grant. The project design foresees, perhaps conservatively, that each engineer&#13;
will be able to assist 5 villages; after experience is gained, it may be possible to assign more villages per&#13;
field engineer. A senior engineer from the core team is available to advise and to supervise progress in&#13;
the field.&#13;
3.8         Some 300 villagers or more may want to work on a subproject; in surveys villagers indicated&#13;
a willingness to work for low "incentive payments" provided the works benefit their village and are seen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
as a public project; furthermore, they would incur no transportation cost nor costs for food away from&#13;
home. Unskilled village labor would get a lump sum for the task, paid periodically by output; this should&#13;
result in some Rp.2,000/3,000 equivalent for a full day of work. The pay should not be so high as to&#13;
attract laborers away from similarly paying activities they would otherwise undertake, since that would&#13;
not create employment; the wage should be low enough for the poor to self-select for the project works.&#13;
If more villagers want to work than the works can absorb, an agreement has to be reached in the village&#13;
as to number of days each interested villager would work and when; the agreement would be reviewed&#13;
by the field engineer for approval of the subproject. A village foreman (mandor) would be designated&#13;
by the LKMD for each subproject and be assisted by the field engineer; skilled labor will also be hired&#13;
as needed, at locally competitive wages.  Organizing workers is an important part of project&#13;
implementation; if found convenient, a contractor can be hired to oversee/manage the works and lessen&#13;
the load of the field engineer (para. 2.12).&#13;
3.9        Java has a large number of NGOs and many are present at the subdistrict and even village&#13;
level. NGOs are welcome to contribute to implementation of the proposed project; in particular, they&#13;
could assist villages with community participation, subproject selection, employment plans and other&#13;
aspects such as monitoring and evaluation. LKMDs can pay for desired NGO services from the village&#13;
allocation.&#13;
D. PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.10        Procurement under the project is required for goods and works and for consultant services.&#13;
Procurement will be in line with Bank procurement guidelines and procedures ("Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" of January 1995 and "Guidelines for the Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by World Bank as Executing Agency" of August 1981).&#13;
3.lI        The engineer/management team, field engineering services, and monitoring and evaluation&#13;
services are selected at the central government level. Consultant contracts with an estimated value of&#13;
$100,000 or more for the engagement of firms, and $50,000 or more for the engagement of individuals.&#13;
are subject to prior review by the Bank. Modalities and status are as follows:&#13;
(a) Engineer/management team. Terms of reference and a shortlist were agreed between the Bank&#13;
and IDT Secretariat during preappraisal in October 1994, and a firm was selected in January 1995.&#13;
The selection was based on submissions detailing the proposed management concept, information&#13;
system, qualification of experts, and costs/costs bases for the contract. The contract is financed&#13;
initially by the TA loan mentioned earlier, and later, under the project loan.&#13;
(b) Field engineer services. A different firm was hired for each province of West. East and&#13;
Central Java. the latter including Yogyakarta needs, to provide field engineers (field engineers&#13;
could be subcontracted from other firms). Terms of reference were agreed at appraisal, as well&#13;
as 3 shortlists each comprising 5 firms. Indonesian firms were shortlisted by Bappedas I and&#13;
foreign firms were also included in compliance with Bank guidelines. The IDT Secretariat invited&#13;
the shortlisted firms to submit proposals in early March, and the selection for the first project year&#13;
was completed in April 1995.&#13;
(c) Monitoring and evaluation services. Terms of reference for monitoring expertise were&#13;
discussed at negotiations. A final set of TORs and a shortlist would be agreed shortly thereafter.&#13;
3.12        Subprojects. It is expected that LKMDs will carry out most works by direct village labor&#13;
(community participation) under implementation agreements with the DPUKs. LKMDs may also contract&#13;
supplies of materials, rental of equipment, and small works by local contractors following national&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
shopping, procurement of small works or direct contracting procedures. No international competitive&#13;
bidding is envisaged. Simplified implementation agreements and documentation for national shopping&#13;
and direct procurement have been agreed and included in the Project Manual (Annex 6). National&#13;
shopping will require 3 quotations for each proposed contract. No contract or agreement would exceed&#13;
$55,000 equivalent (the village grant of Rp. 120 million) and most contracts are expected to be below half&#13;
that amount. All works may be done by community participation; nevertheless, procurement under&#13;
national shopping or small works procedures may total up to some $5 million each, and direct contracting&#13;
are also allowed for contracts up to $10,000 equivalent each, up to an aggregate amount of $10 million&#13;
(see Table 3.1 overleaf). These procedures are in line with the Indonesian government procurement&#13;
rules; under Kepres 16/94, Pimpros can approve, on their own, contracts up to $250,000 equivalent.&#13;
Field engineers will help the LKMDs, as may be needed (i) organize village labor including pay setting,&#13;
(ii) hiring equipment, (iii) purchasing materials and tools; or (iv) contracting out. Works would not start&#13;
until any required compensation for land or assets in the village has been made as mentioned in Annex&#13;
9 and the Project Manual. Contractors will be required to use village labor. The Bank does not require&#13;
prior review of proposed contracts, given their small amounts and their large number, the need for quick&#13;
approval, and the safeguards built-in in the project design (consultants will be in place to assist (field&#13;
engineers) and to supervise (engineer/management team) the process, and further, audits and Bank&#13;
supervision will be conducted, as well as random ex-post review of SOE documentation).&#13;
E. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
3.13        Retroactive financing. As the Bank loan may become effective at the earliest in July 1995,&#13;
in order to start field engineering services in April and village subprojects in May 1995, to take advantage&#13;
of the dry season that is best suited for works, through a letter of the MoF dated April 17, 1995, the&#13;
Government made Rp.20 billion prefinancing available in April 1995 and until proceeds of the proposed&#13;
loan become available.  The Bank proposes to provide retroactive financing for project related&#13;
expenditures incurred after January 31, 1995 and before loan signing, up to a maximum $7.2 million&#13;
equivalent.&#13;
3.14       Disbursements at local level. For reasons of cost efficiency, the project will pay for output&#13;
(itemized works) against measured progress and prorated lump-sum contracts. Following the procedure&#13;
adopted under the Government's IDT poverty program, by instructions of the Ministry of Finance the&#13;
Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) unit closest to the village will be allowed to disburse the village allocation,&#13;
against bills certified by the field engineer.  The field engineer will forward the implementation&#13;
agreements, certified by the camat, contracts and certified bills to the administrative Pimpro in DPUK,&#13;
who in turn will forward a copy to the respective KPKN. LKMDs will be paid at the BRI units when&#13;
presenting their bills certified by the field engineer, according to progress of works. Village laborers thus&#13;
would be paid in cash every 2 weeks or weekly. BRI has agreed to provide simple monthly statements&#13;
for the LKMD accounts, inter alia to the field engineers. The fund flow is shown in Annex 3.&#13;
3.15       The Bank will not be involved in the approval process of every contract and disbursement&#13;
at the village level, but will inspect contracts at random during supervision of the project.  The&#13;
engineer/management team will supervise the subprojects while visiting every project village at least once,&#13;
on behalf of the PMU.&#13;

3.16       Bank disbursements. The loan agreement includes 2 allocated disbursement categories, (i)&#13;
for expenditures incurred by project villages for goods, works and services under grants, at 90%, and&#13;
(ii) consultant services, at 100%. In order to facilitate Bank disbursements, the Government would&#13;
establish a Special Account up to an amount of $10 million in Bank Indonesia. This account should be&#13;
maintained by the Directorate General of Budget, MoF. All disbursements from the Bank loan would&#13;
be made through the Special Account. Since the majority of expenditures under the loan are small local&#13;
currency payments, the 30 days advance from the SA facility will be used for this project. That is, the&#13;
borrower can draw an amount from the SA sufficient to meet eligible expenditures for a period of less&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
than 30 days. After expenditures are incurred using the advance under the 30 days facility, the borrower&#13;
should submit a request for the replenishment using SOE procedures. A bank reconciliation statement&#13;
should also be attached showing inter alia, the deposit received from the Bank, the date on which each&#13;
advance was made and the amount awaiting documentation from BRI. Replenishment applications to the&#13;
Special Account will be made every two weeks or when 20% of the initial deposit has been used,&#13;
whichever is first. The GOI has agreed to make available its Transition Account in support of foreign&#13;
financed projects, to support also the proposed project in case the SA is temporarily short of funds.&#13;
Statements of expenditure (SOEs) would be used for the technical assistance category, for all contracts&#13;
for consulting firms costing less than $100,000 and individual consultants costing less than $50,000.&#13;
Documents supporting the SOEs would be retained by respective project implementation units and made&#13;
available for review as may be requested by visiting Bank missions. The loan will not fund any land&#13;
acquisition. The disbursement schedule is shown above.&#13;
F. PROJECT ACCOUNTS, REPORTS AND AUDITS&#13;
3.17       The project allocation per kabupaten would be inscribed in the yearly local budgets,&#13;
SPABP/APBDII, for recording purposes.&#13;
3.18       As described in the Project Manual, monthly project accounts will be provided through&#13;
various sources:&#13;
a) BRI units involved would prepare monthly statements covering monthly disbursements and&#13;
cumulative totals for each project village, and give a copy to the village/camat and to the field&#13;
engineer/Pimpro;&#13;
b) field engineers would prepare monthly statements on physical progress and value of works in&#13;
their village cluster, and disbursements based on the BRI units' statements, and submit them to the&#13;
senior engineer;&#13;
c) the IDT Secretariat/TA team would consolidate the monthly work-related statements by&#13;
kabupatens every month and check with BRI statements for consistency;&#13;
d) DGB would provide periodically consolidated statements per kabupaten, province and total, for&#13;
reimbursement by the Bank, copied to the IDT Secretariat for information; and&#13;
e) villages would keep track of their funds via the BRI statements posted at the offices of the&#13;
kepala desas, camats, and BRI unit, and data also posted on employment, outputs and remuneration&#13;
compiled by the kepala desa/field engineer.&#13;
3.19       Periodic reports will be provided as follows:&#13;
a) the IDT Secretariat will prepare short quarterly reports and an annual report by end March,&#13;
including progress per category (roads, water supply, piers, bridges, others; and labor, materials,&#13;
contracts);&#13;
b) the DPUK Pimpros will keep copy of certified statements to account for expenditures related&#13;
to the APBDK allocations and will compile an annual report for Bappedas 11; and&#13;
c) the IDT Secretariat would report annually on project progress and on implementation of the&#13;
Government's Action Plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
3.20       Confirmation was obtained during negotiations that the above reporting system. as included&#13;
in the Project Manual, will be complied with. It was also agreed that the consolidated project accounts,&#13;
including the Special Account and the SOEs, would be audited annually by independent auditors in a&#13;
manner satisfactory to the Bank and that the audit report would be submitted to the Bank no later than&#13;
October 30, commencing in 1996. The audits will be joint responsibility of DG Budget (MoF) and IDT&#13;
Secretariat. The Bank would have no objection to BPKP conducting the audits. Financial audits would&#13;
be conducted randomly, but should cover at least 2 subprojects in every kabupaten (10% coverage). In&#13;
addition, assurances were obtained that independent auditors will be appointed for technical audits of&#13;
project implementation aspects in a manner satisfactory to the Bank. The financial and technical audits&#13;
would be made simultaneously for the same subprojects, and start early to avoid bunching. Terms of&#13;
reference for the audits will be agreed with the Bank.&#13;
G. PROJECT MONITORING AND BANK SUPERVISION&#13;
3.21        Physical progress as well as other aspects of the project will be monitored following forms&#13;
and indicators included in the Project Manual. The indicators to be used were agreed at negotiations,&#13;
as part of the reporting/monitoring system. Participation of the poor--man-days of employment, average&#13;
and total pay to labor; physical works--such as kilometers of access roads built, effect on farmgate price&#13;
levels -- public transportation costs. Any land and compensation matters, environmental effects, quality&#13;
of selection and implementation of works, are to be reviewed and reported on a sampling basis.&#13;
Comparisons will eventually be made with costs/results of other types of interventions. The indicators&#13;
for monitoring the project were agreed at negotiations, and a sample is in Annex 7.&#13;
3.22       The IDT Secretariat would make available to the Bank the progress reports mentioned in&#13;
the preceding section. The Bank would supervise the project via 3 visits per year to selected villages,&#13;
BRI units and other relevant agencies to review all aspects of progress, such as local employment, costs&#13;
and progress of work and impact on beneficiaries/the village. The Bank and GOI would undertake an&#13;
in-depth review after the first year implementation around February 1996; any adjustment deemed&#13;
necessary will be made following the review. A Supervision Plan is included in Annex 8.&#13;
H. LAND ACQUISITION, RESETTLEMENT AND CONIPENSATION&#13;
3.23       No physical displacement is expected to take place under this project. Subprojects requiring&#13;
displacement will be redesigned to avoid resettlement or alternative subprojects must be proposed. The&#13;
infrastructure to be financed is generally of a small scale. Installations for a public source of drinking&#13;
water, a tap or a pump, do not need much space; small pipes--may be no more than a hose--if needed&#13;
to bring water from a natural source cause little disruption on land use. All weather access roads would&#13;
normally be built on existing access paths, and would be no more than 3 to 4 meters wide. This width&#13;
may exceed an existing access by no more than a meter. Since houses are normally set back from roads,&#13;
impacts would therefore be minimal. In those cases where houses are partially located within the&#13;
widening area, house owners normally agree to move them back because houses are normally temporary&#13;
(bamboo) structures that can be moved relatively easily, and property values increase significantly once&#13;
roads are built--owners could sell the property later at a profit, as there is an active land market on Java.&#13;
3.24       Economic impacts caused by land acquisition are also expected to be slight for the same&#13;
reasons. The Project Manual mentions the need to keep land acquisition to a minimum. Traditional&#13;
processes of voluntary contributions will be followed in villages where some land is unavoidably needed.&#13;
To minimize peer pressure risk, however, where land needed exceeds for example 20% of a villager's&#13;
plot, the affected villagers will be given replacement land, other equivalent productive assets or other in-&#13;
kind compensation as negotiated during the village consultation meetings (normally common-tenure land&#13;
is used for compensation). If a solid structure has to be demolished, the village would provide materials&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
and help build an equivalent structure. Subprojects that involve compensation of this nature for land or&#13;
other assets will not be approved by field engineers unless adequate compensation arrangements have been&#13;
agreed by the villager affected and the LKMD, and compensation should have been made prior to the&#13;
start of work (para. 3.12). In the unlikely event that a larger number of persons were negatively affected&#13;
due to a subproject (e.g. more than 200 each lost more than 20% of their land or assets) and the field&#13;
engineer found no alternative that would reduce the number of affected persons, then Bank approval of&#13;
a related compensation/resettlement plan would be sought prior to proceeding with the subproject. In&#13;
case of disagreement, affected villagers can complain to their field engineer and camat. They can also&#13;
complain in writing to the P.O. Complaints Box 5000 instituted successfully for the IDT program (para.&#13;
1.7). The criteria have been agreed with the Government as summarized in Annex 9; they are included&#13;
in the Project Manual. The above criteria are consistent with the Bank Guidelines for Involuntary&#13;
Resettlement (that include both physically relocated as well as only economically affected persons; the&#13;
proposed project foresees only the latter) that require that negatively affected families have their standard&#13;
of living improved or at least restored to pre-project levels.&#13;
1. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS&#13;
3.25       The project has been classified in environmental category B.  The scope of village&#13;
subprojects will be relatively minor, as mentioned in para. 3.24. Access roads would be built with&#13;
appropriate alignments, cross and longitudinal drainage and gradients to lengthen the road life and&#13;
minimize erosion that higher standard roads may create. With an all weather access to each village, use&#13;
of some alternative earth tracks may be reduced thus lessening erosion along the tracks. Better provision&#13;
of water in the project areas which are normally short of water in dry seasons should have a beneficial&#13;
environmental impact and may even help grow vegetative contours. Overall the environmental impact&#13;
is expected to be small and mostly positive. Given the progranumatic nature of the project and the small&#13;
environmental impact expected, no environmental impact assessment will be prepared up front. Progress&#13;
reports would indicate any problems encountered and solutions adopted during implementation.&#13;
3.26         Standard designs and criteria have been prepared in the past by DG Bina Marga and DG&#13;
Cipta Karya for such small works; these designs incorporate environmental guidelines.  The&#13;
engineer/management team for the project have reviewed the standard designs and guidelines and&#13;
prepared a shorter Project Manual for easy reference in the field. The field engineers are to incorporate&#13;
sound environmental criteria in designs of subprojects and verify their compliance during construction&#13;
supervision. The draft final Project Manual was agreed by the Bank at negotiations.&#13;
3.27       Field engineers are also to explain to villagers the importance of maintenance and how to&#13;
maintain the infrastructures built under the project, for the works to last and environmental sustainability.&#13;
A maintenance plan would be prepared in each village.&#13;
4. PROJECT JUSTICATION AND RISKS&#13;
A. JUSTIFICATION&#13;
4.1        The Government wants to accelerate poverty reduction in Indonesia and has assigned a high&#13;
priority in the Bank's lending program to assisting its poverty program. The project provides a direct&#13;
means to reach poor villages, potentially faster and enabling a higher share of the funds to reach the poor,&#13;
as layers of agency involvement and supply delivery costs are reduced. By directing the funds to&#13;
community selected infrastructure projects likely to also be implemented with self-help, the community&#13;
sense and productivity of the poor is expected to increase and allow the poor to participate in economic&#13;
growth while contributing to it. Also, the project focuses on infrastructure where implementation&#13;
effectiveness is generally higher.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
4.2        Many ongoing programs already focus on the outer islands. Assisting poor villages in Java&#13;
improve their infrastructure is justified; villages on Java have larger populations so that more people will&#13;
use and benefit from infrastructure there, and construction costs are generally lower on Java than&#13;
elsewhere--meaning that more can be achieved with a fiscal dollar targeted on Java. Furthermore, while&#13;
the overall poverty incidence may be lower on Java than elsewhere, on Java the poor are more numerous&#13;
and may be relatively concentrated in smaller areas that can be targeted and where the cash may be more&#13;
easily used in a productive way than in remote, outer island villages. According to the SUSENAS&#13;
expenditure surveys, some 9 million absolute poor live in rural areas in Java; and according to the&#13;
PODES surveys, one third or some 6000 of the villages on Java are poor and comprise some 18 million&#13;
people. According to various sources, Java has a higher than average infant mortality and high&#13;
malnutrition. While not all the absolute poor live in the poor villages, addressing the needs of the poor&#13;
villages facilitates targeting.&#13;
4.3        Project beneficiaries would exceed 3 million. The population of the 415 villages selected&#13;
for the first project year totals some 1.1 million--the villages average some 2600 residents, varying from&#13;
700 to 10,000 residents, and the average area is 500 hectares; even though they are "rural", population&#13;
densities are high in the villages: more than 4 persons per hectare in West Java, almost 7 in Central Java&#13;
and almost 6 in East Java--and not all the land can be farmed. The population of the 1200 poor villages&#13;
to be assisted under the project would total more than 3.3 million, living on some 650,000 ha (6500 kin2).&#13;
Furthermore, poor laborers from outside the project villages will also benefit: materials such as stone,&#13;
gravel and sand for road surfacing and works normally have to be procured from outside the villages,&#13;
and it is normally poor landless laborers who work in quarries. The project cost per beneficiary is about&#13;
$25 equivalent.&#13;
4.4        Employment and cash compensation to village laborers is an important feature of the project.&#13;
Many villagers in the selected poor villages have just subsistence livelihoods, with a minimum of cash&#13;
incomes that however are necessary to buy clothing, medicine, school materials, transport services and&#13;
other necessities. Many are living with no more than $100 equivalent per year. The cash to be earned&#13;
under the project should provide an important addition to the poorer household budgets; works can be&#13;
scheduled so as not to interfere with other income earning activities. With the cash earned, villagers&#13;
ought to be able to improve their assets and current consumption. More of the funds would actually&#13;
reach the poor villagers compared to funds under other targeted public programs with higher delivery&#13;
costs and less self-targeting.&#13;
4.5        Labor-intensive methods are also efficient for the public budget. Villagers are willing to&#13;
work for the equivalent of about $1 per day, and at that cost labor intensive methods are competitive with&#13;
capital intensive methods for the simple type of works envisaged. The villagers will have to undertake&#13;
to maintain the village facilities to be built under the project; but having participated in the building, and&#13;
because the infrastructure is for their own benefit, in surveys villagers have indicated that they would do&#13;
the maintenance, provided they are taught how to. If the project proves successful then some funding&#13;
under current top-down programs could be reassigned in the future to similar local decision-making and&#13;
labor-intensive implementation projects--neglected kabupaten road maintenance and even improvement&#13;
would be a prime candidate for the shift toward a lengthman system.&#13;
4.6        In addition to employment benefits and reduced unit costs of works, the assets to be built&#13;
under the project have high rates of return, exceeding 20%. A majority of the funds will likely be used&#13;
to build all weather access roads and bridges--many of the poor villages lack a good connection to their&#13;
kecamatan center; at some 2,500 persons per village paths have considerable traffic--several villages may&#13;
also use a common access--and their upgrading to all weather passibility has good economic returns. The&#13;
provision of drinking water, as demonstrated already in other projects, also has high returns. Examples&#13;
of the high returns to providing all weather access roads and bridges are illustrated in Annex 10. Field&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
engineers will verify that subprojects have a minimum number of beneficiaries and a maximum cost per&#13;
beneficiary.&#13;
4.7        It is hoped that villagers can gain some technical and administrative knowledge with the&#13;
program; furthermore, villagers would be trained to undertake maintenance works, that have high returns,&#13;
during the one year, perhaps two, that the experts will assist each village. As Java is densely populated,&#13;
all weather access would make possible/affordable commuting from the village to nearby jobs and slow&#13;
down outright emigration from rural areas.&#13;
B. RISKS&#13;
4.8         Being an innovative pilot for the Bank, the project could be assumed to entail considerable&#13;
risk. However, the risk of "wrong" projects being chosen in villages seems small given that consultations&#13;
processes are involved anid it is in the interest of the village to do the most with its allocation. The risk&#13;
of fund diversion seems to be small, given that funds will go directly to the beneficiary village, the&#13;
program is transparent and controls are in place for uses within the village. The risk of using labor-&#13;
intensive methods, generally more difficult than capital-intensive methods due to logistics involved, is&#13;
worthwhile confronting in order to promote paid employment in poor rural villages deficient in small&#13;
infrastructures.  Self-help projects and small local contractors already often employ labor-intensive&#13;
methods, and the engineering inputs foreseen under the project should help enhance productivity levels&#13;
and improve quality of designs and works. A focus on quality output should hopefully give an example&#13;
to follow subsequently in other works. Furthermore, cost savings would compensate risks of labor&#13;
intensive works. There is also a risk that the project cannot be implemented as fast as scheduled due to&#13;
absorptive capacity constraints, but the project would allow extending the program implementation and&#13;
the technical assistance; the project also allows flexibility in adding villages if found justified. There is&#13;
a risk of subsequent maintenance of the infrastructures being faulty; however, the villagers are the users&#13;
and the infrastructure sustainability will be of prime concern to them. The field engineers are further to&#13;
impress on villagers the low costs and high benefits of maintenance, maintenance practices, and as&#13;
necessary, identify sources for financing future maintenance. During project implementation, independent&#13;
monitoring, audits and supervision should all help identify problems and take early corrective action.&#13;
5. AGREENIENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
5.1         The following was agreed at negotiations:&#13;
a) Village coverage: villages for the second year program starting in 1996 shall be selected by&#13;
September 1995 and the village list (and an eventual third year list) will be reviewed with the Bank&#13;
in December 1995 (para. 2.8);&#13;
b) Project information dissemination: villages selected for the program will be informed no later&#13;
than April 1, 1996 and if applicable, 1997 and be provided with public information about the&#13;
program (para. 2.9);&#13;
c) Government staff: Bupatis would designate Pimpros TkII in the selected kabupatens by March&#13;
31 every project year (para. 2.14). Camats would endorse subprojects by May 30, 1995 and&#13;
March 31, 1996 (and 1997 if applicable) (para. 2.11);&#13;
d) Project Manual: a Manual comprising implementation arrangements and procurement formats&#13;
and procedures (para. 3.12), reporting formats (para. 3.20), project performance indicators to be&#13;
used for monitoring (para. 3.21), guidelines for compensating negatively affected persons (para.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
221&#13;
3.24), environmental standards (para. 3.26), maintenance provisions (para. 3.27), and subproject&#13;
selection criteria (para. 4.6), was agreed; and&#13;
e) Audits and mid-term review: financial and technical audits would be conducted no later than&#13;
October 30, commencing in 1996 (para. 3.20), and a mid-tern review will be conducted about&#13;
February 1996 (para. 3.22).&#13;
5.2        With the actions already taken prior to negotiations and the above confirmations, the project&#13;
would be suitable for a Bank loan of $72.5 million equivalent with a 20 year maturity including a 5 year&#13;
grace period at the standard Bank's variable interest rate. The Borrower would be the Republic of&#13;
Indonesia.&#13;

VILLAGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT FOR JAVA&#13;
Performance Indicators&#13;
Physical progress as well as other aspects of the project will be monitored and reflected&#13;
in a progress reporting system as included in the Project Manual.&#13;
Among the indicators that will be monitored periodically are the following:&#13;
Employment impact&#13;
man-days of employment (on a 6 hour daily basis)&#13;
% women,&#13;
% young&#13;
average daily pay&#13;
total payments to labor&#13;
payments for material supplies&#13;
Subprojects&#13;
Completed:&#13;
kms of road&#13;
number of bridges&#13;
number of docks/piers&#13;
sanitation facilities&#13;
water supply subprojects&#13;
other;&#13;
(specify)&#13;
Number of beneficiaries:&#13;
average per subproject&#13;
total&#13;
cost per beneficiary (on sampling basis)&#13;
Less frequent reports, and in particular an evaluation report on broader impact&#13;
monitoring will also be prepared. Given the short project implementation period, of 2-3 years, it&#13;
is not expected that broader impacts could be fully captured by the mid-term review in February&#13;
1996.&#13;

VILLAGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT FOR JAVA&#13;
Supervision Plan&#13;
Bank Supervision Input.&#13;
a.    Regular supervision needs for the review of progress reports, procurement actions,&#13;
correspondence, etc. are estimated to require four staff weeks per year. The staff input&#13;
indicated in the table overleaf is additional based on (i) the key activities mentioned in&#13;
Annex 5 (Optimal yearly schedule), and (ii) the assumption that a third year 1997/98 will&#13;
be needed to complete the civil works program.&#13;
b.    Each of the four provinces should be visited at least once per year during project&#13;
implementation. Given the geographic dispersion of the villages, each supervision mission&#13;
should focus on only a few clusters which would be deemed typical because of their&#13;
characteristics and their performance, as shown by the progress reports.&#13;
C.    Staff from the Resident Mission would assist in the supervision of this project, in particular&#13;
(i) in the environmentaVsocial impact reviews and (ii) in the random ex-post review of the&#13;
large amount of SOE documentation.&#13;
2.    Borrower's Contribution to Supervision.&#13;
a.    A Project Launch Workshop is to be organized by GOI, after full mobilization of the EMC&#13;
and the Field Engineers, but before the start of the civil works period (May to September).&#13;
b.    The IDT Project Secretariat is to be the responsible for project coordination, for&#13;
arrangements for Bank supervision missions, and for providing requested information.&#13;
c.    Review meetings with the participation of the various project agencies will be held&#13;
normally in February of each year, to discuss the previous year's performance and the&#13;
current year program. The February 1996 will be a mid-term project implementation&#13;
review.&#13;
d.    Quarterly Progress reports will report on physical progress as well as other aspects of the&#13;
project. A sample of the indicators to be used as part of the reporting/monitoring system&#13;
are described in Annex 7.&#13;

INDONESIA&#13;
VILLAGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT FOR JAVA&#13;
GUIDELINES FOR COMPENSATION FOR LAND OR ASSET ACQUISITION&#13;
bjectives&#13;
1.    Land acquisition will be kept to a minimum and no person will be physically displaced under&#13;
subprojects financed under the Project. Subproject proposals that would require demolishing houses or&#13;
acquiring productive land should be carefully reviewed to minimize their impacts through alternative&#13;
alignments. Proposals that require more than minor expansion along rights of way should be reviewed&#13;
carefully. Land or other assets may be acquired through&#13;
(a) Voluntary contributions. In accordance with traditional practices, villagers may elect to voluntarily&#13;
contribute land or assets and/or relocate temporarily or permanently from their land without a&#13;
compensation;&#13;
(b) Contributions against compensation.  A contributor considered "affected" will be eligible for&#13;
compensation.&#13;
2.     These guidelines provide principles and instructions to compensate affected persons under 1.(b)&#13;
above, to ensure that all such persons negatively affected, regardless of their land tenure status, will be&#13;
assisted to improve, or at least restore, their living standards, income earning or production capacity to&#13;
pre-project levels. However, if acquired assets are less than 20%, the field engineer may dispense with&#13;
the procedural requirements delineated in para. 5 below.&#13;
Compensation Principles&#13;
3.     The LKMD shall ensure that any of the following means of compensation are timely provided to&#13;
affected persons (the village grant cannot be used to pay compensation):&#13;
(a) replacement land with an equally productive plot or other equivalent productive assets;&#13;
(b) materials and assistance to fully replace solid structures to be demolished;&#13;
(c) replacement of damaged or lost crops at market value;&#13;
(d) other acceptable in-kind compensation.&#13;
Consultation Process&#13;
4.     The LKMD will ensure that all occupants of land and owners of assets located in a proposed&#13;
subproject area, are consulted. There will be a village meeting to inform villagers about their rights to&#13;
compensation and options available in accordance with these Guidelines. The Minutes of the village&#13;
meeting shall reflect the discussions held, agreements reached, and include the following:&#13;
(a) for any voluntary contributions, name of contributor and details about the contribution;&#13;
(b) for land/asset acquisition against compensation, names of affected persons and details about the nature&#13;
and level of compensation.&#13;

(3) trees or crops affected&#13;
(4) signatures of villagers, kepala desa&#13;
(5) record of any complaints raised by affected persons&#13;
(6) map attached (showing affected areas and replacement areas)&#13;
5.    The field engineer shall provide a copy of the Minutes to affected persons and confirm in&#13;
discussions with each of them their requests and preferences for compensation, agreements reached, and&#13;
any eventual complaint.&#13;
Subprqject Approyal&#13;
6.    In the event that a subproject involves acquisition against compensation, the field engineer shall:&#13;
(a) not approve the subproject unless a satisfactory compensation has been agreed between the affected&#13;
person and the LKMD, as mentioned above;&#13;
(b) not allow works to start until the compensation has been completed satisfactorily to the affected&#13;
persons;&#13;
(c) in the unlikely event that more than 200 persons were affected and required compensation in a village,&#13;
a compensation plan has to be prepared, and approved by the IDT Secretariat, before the subproject can&#13;
be approved.&#13;
Complaints and Grievances&#13;
7.     All complaints should first be negotiated to reach an agreement at the village level. If this fails,&#13;
complaints and grievances about these Guidelines, implementation of the agreements recorded in the&#13;
Village Minutes or any alleged irregularity in carrying out the project can also be addressed by the&#13;
affected persons or their representative at the kecamatan level. If this also fails, the complaint may be&#13;
submitted to the Bupati for a decision.&#13;
Verification&#13;
8.     The village Minutes and evidence of compensation having been made shall be provided to the&#13;
field engineer assisting the village, to supervising engineers, auditors and socio-economic monitorers&#13;
when undertaking reviews under the Project.&#13;

VILLAGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT FOR JAVA&#13;
SAMPLE ECONOMIC RETURNS TO VILLAGE INFRASTRUCTURE&#13;
I.    In addition to employment benefits and reduced unit costs of works, the assets to be built under the&#13;
project have high rates of return. A majority of the funds will likely be used to build all weather access&#13;
roads and bridges. For instance, the kabupatens on the south coast of West Java have some of the lowest&#13;
agricultural potential in the province: excluding the kabupaten Garut, 2 of whose kecamatan are covered by&#13;
an ADB marginal farmer community development project, the other 6 kabupaten cover some 10,000 km2&#13;
transversed east-west by a mountain range with poor soils at mid altitudes, used for secondary growth and&#13;
shifting cultivation that yield low incomes although they could be used for higher value, but capital&#13;
intensive, crops. The 6 kabupaten include 711 villages identified as poor for the 1994 IDT, distributed in 42&#13;
kecamatans (averaging 15 poor villages per kecamatan--there would be more villages, non-poor, and not&#13;
counted here). Many of the poor villages lack all weather access to their kecamatan center; at an assumed&#13;
2,500 persons per village (less than the average 3,200 for West Java) the poor village population would total&#13;
some 1.8 million. Paths have considerable traffic--several villages may use a common access--and their&#13;
upgrading to all weather possibility has good economic returns. Access road and bridge examples can&#13;
illustrate:&#13;
(a) The 500 family village Cidadap, in the kabupaten Lebak of West Java, has an average income per&#13;
family of only Rp.150,000 per month. It also has a 5 km clayish surfaced access road that becomes&#13;
impassable for 4 wheel vehicles (even 4 wheel-drive vehicles) in the rainy season;&#13;
(i) The village has abundant rambutan trees, that produce more than 1000 tons of fruit per year.&#13;
The fruits are highly priced in cities (Rp.700 per kg at the kabupaten capital) but they must be&#13;
harvested and transported to markets in one peak week, during the rainy season. Due to the access&#13;
road condition, only some fruit is hanged on sticks (pikul) and carried by porters to the asphalt road,&#13;
at a cost of Rp.50 per kg, and the farmgate price is only Rp.400 per kg. With an all weather road,&#13;
transport by van would cost about Rp.15 per kg instead of Rp.50 for the 5 km. Thus the road&#13;
improvement, at a cost of some Rp.120 million, would allow an additional income per year from&#13;
rambutan alone of at least Rp.30 million (transport cost savings for some 800 tons). The rate of&#13;
return of the village grant would be more than 30% on this basis alone (the village porters could&#13;
become harvesters or packers and not lose income).&#13;
(ii) But the return is higher: the cost of transport of other products would also be reduced--on&#13;
average per ton-km from Rp.10,000 by pikul to Rp.2,860 by van, or even less by medium sized&#13;
truck; and&#13;
(iii) Passenger traffic, more than 10 vehicles per day in the dry season, could continue in the rainy&#13;
season. The cost per passenger-km in rainy seasons, more than Rp.500 by motorcycle (the local&#13;
taxi) would decrease to Rp.140, the rate by van in dry seasons--high school age children, who&#13;
cannot afford the motorcycle from the village to the school in town, at Rp.5000 per day, or the cost&#13;
of staying in town, could attend school.&#13;
(iv) In all, the road improvement should have a return exceeding 40%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
52&#13;
(b) Other villages may not have such high value crops, but if a road improvement generates just 3 van retirn&#13;
trips per day during the rainy season, then its cost could have a 10% rate of return (from savings compared&#13;
to the cost by motorcycle), and traffic generation is likely to be higher, given the large village populations.&#13;
Thus overall and in particular when it makes access possible, road improvement has high returns.&#13;
(c) Java has numerous small and medium sized rivers that swell in the rainy season making boat passage&#13;
very dilficult. Small rivers usually span makeshift bridges that may not allow cars to pass and need&#13;
improvemenit or upgrading.  Larger rivers sometimes isolate villages. isolated villagers would like&#13;
sLIspension bridges that can carry pedestrians and motorcycles to render jobs, markets and schools&#13;
accessible. In one village a 50 meter suspension bridge had been built with Red Cross support of only&#13;
$15,000 dollars equivalent for materials and with free labor provided by villagers (see picture overleaf); this&#13;
bridge had integrated the village with the "other" side. Thus the cost of such bridges is low and their&#13;
economic returns are very high.&#13;
2.     Additional supplies of drinking water is also a high priority of many villages. During dry seasons&#13;
many villages relying on surface water for drinking water face shortages and villagers have to walk long&#13;
distances to fetch water from a natural source or have to pay for water delivery. Some other projects such&#13;
as the Bank's Water Supply and Sanitation for Low Income Communities (Ln. 3629) are already assisting in&#13;
providing drinking water, but they are not covering all the poor villages that need it. Provision of clean&#13;
water has high returns, in terms of time saved and improved health standards.&#13;
3.     Villagers may also choose to build sanitation facilities, storage sheds for agricultural produce,&#13;
drainage improvemenlts or other small infrastructures that they consider to be of priority. The communal&#13;
selection process, and the requirement of a minimum number of users per infrastructure/a maximum cost&#13;
per beneficiary (to be included in the Project Manual) should help guarantee that only justified projects are&#13;
uLidertaken.&#13;

            Indonesia - Village Infrastructure Project
            for Java
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Village Infrastructure Project for
            Java aims at providing public infrastructure and employment
            in 1,200 villages, the bottom 20 percent of the poorest or 6
            percent of all rural villages on Java. It includes a 2-3
            year pilot program to increase government decentralization,
            transparency and village participation. Main features are:
            1) empowering villagers to decide, with some economic
            criteria, priority uses of the village grant under the
            project; 2) creation of jobs paid in cash for poor
            villagers, especially in periods of underemployment; 3)
            development of skills for constructing small public works -
            engineering assistance will be provided to villagers to help
            with subproject design and achieving good quality works; 4)
            channelling of village grants through subdistrict branches
            of Bank Rakyat Indonesia; and 5) a monitoring program to
            review progress while the project is underway and overall
            results, expost.
