            The authors propose a number of
            privatization rules to ensure that management will improve
            after privatization. Governments should ensure that the
            privatized sector has several firms operating in industries
            that are local natural monopolies, so that if one operator
            goes bankrupt, another can readily take over. Governments
            should also permit concentrated ownership and foreign
            ownership, and profits should not be guaranteed through regulation.
