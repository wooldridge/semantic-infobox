LABOR FORCE, EMPLOYMENT AND LABOR MARKETS      WMAS211:CTON. D.C. 20431&#13;
IN THE COURSE OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT&#13;
A Background Study for World Development Report, 1979&#13;
Low rates of industrial employment growth, high rates of unemploy-&#13;
ment for new entrants to the labor market and low levels of labor productivity&#13;
and remuneration are the three issues addressed in this paper. With respect&#13;
to the first, it is demonstrated that the sectoral transformation of the labor&#13;
force in developing countries has been retarded in comparison with historical&#13;
experience, not by unusually slow expansion in industrial employment, but by&#13;
unusually fast labor force growth. With respect to the second, the concentra-&#13;
tion of high rates of unemployment among young, inexperienced but first-time&#13;
entrants to the urban labor market is attributed to the varying rates at which&#13;
wages in different segments of the market have adjusted to the unprecendented&#13;
expansion in the supply of such workers, and to the ability of relatively rich&#13;
families to support their dependents during a period of job-search. And with&#13;
respect to the last, low productivity and remuneration are attributed, not to&#13;
labor market distortions, but primarily to inappropriate macroeconomic policies.&#13;
Accordingly, much of the policy discussion is concerned with the identification&#13;
of the more important determinants of labor demand and supply and the extext&#13;
to which the development of the former has been restrained, and that of the&#13;
latter advanced, by inappropriate or inadequate policies. On the demand side,&#13;
industrial trade policy, agricultural growth and the operation of capital&#13;
markets are singled out for discussion, and on the supply side attention is&#13;
focussed on population and education policy.&#13;

Introduction and Conclusions&#13;
Issues&#13;
This survey is concerned with the following three issues:&#13;
(a) The Industrial Structure of the Labor Force&#13;
It is frequently claimed that industrial sector labor absorption in&#13;
the LDCs has been inadequate in the sense that only a small proportion of the&#13;
incremental labor force has obtained industrial jobs. It is shown here,&#13;
however, that industrial employment in the LDCs has increased at twice the&#13;
rate achieved historically by the DCs. The transformation in the industrial&#13;
structure of the LDC labor force has been retarded in comparison with histor-&#13;
ical experience, not by unusually slow expansion in industrial employment, but&#13;
by unusually fast population and labor force growth. Moreover, because the&#13;
latter is determined mainly by past population growth with a lag of approx-&#13;
imately fifteen years, the high and increasing rates of population growth&#13;
experienced recently in Africa, Latin America and South Asia have yet to be&#13;
reflected in their respective labor force growth rates.&#13;
Paradoxically, it is also argued that the observed transformation,&#13;
although slow by historical standards, may have been too fast for contemporary&#13;
conditions in low-income LDCs. Agricultural labor demand has been suppressed&#13;
by inappropriate pricing policies and an unequal and inefficient distribution&#13;
of investible resources. As a result, the nonagricultural sector's share in&#13;
total employment has increased more rapidly than it otherwise would have.&#13;
(b) Unemployment&#13;
Measured unemployment is defined as those actively seeking jobs.&#13;
This implies that two conditions must be fulfilled before positive unemployment&#13;
rates can be expected in LDCs: first, the return to job-search must be&#13;
positive, which, in turn, requires the existence of wage differentials and&#13;
imperfect information; and second, nonlabor income must be available to&#13;
finance the unemployed. It follows that the concentration of high rates of&#13;
unemployment among young, inexperienced but educated, first-time entrants to&#13;
the urban labor market can be attributed to the varying rates at which wages&#13;
in different segments of the market have adjusted to the unprecedented&#13;
expansion in the supply of such workers, and to the ability of relatively rich&#13;
families to support their dependents during a period of unemployment.&#13;
Wage differentials for unskilled, uneducated labor have also&#13;
attracted considerable attention, not because unemployment rates are corres-&#13;
pondingly high, the poor being unable to finance prolonged job-search, but&#13;
because of the implied misallocation of labor resources. Minimum wage and&#13;
social security legislation, trade union activity and the hiring practices of&#13;
large-scale firms are often alleged to have created "high-wage" sectors, with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ii -&#13;
the result that the sectoral allocation of labor is less than optimal. It is&#13;
argued here, however, that the extent of "institutional" wage determination&#13;
has been exaggerated; that the significance of labor heterogeneity has not&#13;
been fully recognized; and that, to the extent distortions do exist, their&#13;
removal would have little impact on the economy-wide marginal product of&#13;
labor.&#13;
(c) Underemployment&#13;
The concept of underemployment has suffered from a bewildering&#13;
variety of definitions. It is defined here as all those whose earnings from&#13;
wage or self-employment lie below a given cut-off level, this being the&#13;
approach most frequently adopted in the recent literature; it is, therefore,&#13;
conceptually similar to measures of the extent of poverty. Concern for the&#13;
underemployed, thus defined, can arise for two reasons: first, because their&#13;
low earnings are thought to be the consequence of fragmented factor markets,&#13;
distorted product markets and other divergences between social and private&#13;
measures of costs and benefits resulting from externalities; and second,&#13;
because society may consider the achievement of a more equal distribution of&#13;
income a legitimate goal. In this survey attention is focussed on the first&#13;
reason and policy conclusions are drawn accordingly. Conclusions for a more&#13;
egalitarian approach, however, although remaining implicit, can be deduced&#13;
from the discussion in a number of instances.&#13;
Delimiting the exercise in this fashion, the obvious policy pres-&#13;
cription is the removal of distortions in the labor market. As argued above,&#13;
however, this is unlikely to increase labor productivity significantly. Much&#13;
of this paper, therefore, is concerned with the identification of the more&#13;
important determinants of labor demand and supply and the extent to which the&#13;
development of the former has been restrained, and that of the latter advanced,&#13;
by inappropriate or inadequate policies. On the demand side, industrial trade&#13;
policy, agricultural growth and the operation of capital markets are singled&#13;
out for discussion, and on the supply side attention is focussed on population&#13;
and education policy.&#13;
Organization&#13;
The above identifies the major areas, and indicates the tenor, of&#13;
subsequent discussion, but does not provide an outline of the survey. Briefly,&#13;
the survey comprises four sections. Part I provides a statistical overview of&#13;
the three issues identified above. Historical and cross-sectional comparisons&#13;
are used to place in perspective the quantitative dimensions of population and&#13;
labor force growth, sectoral employment expansion, and the growth in the&#13;
supply of educated labor. Recent trends in labor productivity, developments&#13;
in real wages, and estimates of unemployment and underemployment are also&#13;
reviewed in Part I.&#13;
The operation of labor markets and the determination of wages are&#13;
discussed in Part II. Rural wage-rate determination and the causes and&#13;
consequences of rural-urban migration are examined first. The bulk of Part&#13;
II, however, is concerned with the operation of urban labor markets. Simple&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iii -&#13;
numerical exercises are conducted to illustrate the quantitative significance&#13;
of the elimination of institutionally-induced distortions in the market for&#13;
unskilled labor. The causes of educated unemployment are also examined.&#13;
In Parts II and IV selected policies affecting respectively labor&#13;
demand and supply are reviewed. On the demand side three policies are con-&#13;
sidered - the promotion of manufacturing, the development of agriculture and&#13;
efforts to increase the efficiency of capital markets. On the supply side,&#13;
population programs are obviously relevant; education policy is also considered&#13;
because of the high rates of unemployment recorded for educated labor.&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
The policy conclusions relate mainly to factors influencing labor&#13;
demand and supply, and not to factors influencing the operation of labor&#13;
markets. This reflects a major proposition of this paper - namely, that labor&#13;
markets work reasonably well. This is not to deny the significance of labor&#13;
market imperfections in certain instances; it is to suggest, however, that&#13;
improvements in the well-being of the underemployed will not be significantly&#13;
advanced by efforts to increase the efficiency of labor markets in the absence&#13;
of policies designed to increase labor demand and reduce labor supply.&#13;
Accordingly, labor market policies are treated relatively briefly, attention&#13;
being focussed mainly on the labor demand and supply policies.&#13;
The most frequently invoked labor market policy is minimum wage&#13;
legislation. It should be recognized that such legislation can serve a useful&#13;
purpose especially where oligopsonistic conditions allow employers to take&#13;
advantage of unorganized workers; as a "floor," legislated minimum wages are&#13;
to be encouraged but, as a standard-setting rate for a significant part of the&#13;
unskilled labor force, they serve only to disrupt the efficient allocation of&#13;
labor resources. The salary structure adopted by the public sector is the&#13;
other major mechanism for state determination of wages. Frequently, the&#13;
public sector is the main employer of educated labor and can, therefore,&#13;
exercise considerable influence over the structure of salaries. The high&#13;
rates of educated unemployment observed in many countries indicate that&#13;
adjustments in the labor market have been inadequate. In part, this may&#13;
reflect the failure of recent school-leavers to recognize and accept changes&#13;
in labor market conditions; in part, however, it also reflects the failure of&#13;
salary structures to adjust to changed labor supply conditions. The former&#13;
indicates the need for improved information flows in the labor market -&#13;
information services, labor exchanges and job-placement agencies - and the&#13;
latter the need for increased flexibility in the public sector's salary&#13;
structure.&#13;
Labor mobility is an essential attribute of a well-functioning labor&#13;
market, but current rates of rural-urban migration are frequently described as&#13;
excessive. The roots of this concern, however, are shown to lie, not in the&#13;
labor market, but in policies that suppress the demand for agricultural labor&#13;
- excessive protection for industry relative to agriculture and capital market&#13;
imperfections - and in policies that increase the costs of urbanization - the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iv -&#13;
provision of free or subsidized public services. The solution, therefore, is&#13;
not to be found in the imposition of quantitative restrictions on rural-urban&#13;
migration, but in the reformulation of pricing and investment policies.&#13;
Before discussing labor demand issues, it is important to recall&#13;
that the analysis is confined to policies that improve the efficiency of&#13;
resource allocation. This exercise, therefore, may be viewed as an attempt&#13;
to identify those efficiency-enhancing policies which also yield substantial&#13;
labor-demand benefits. It is also useful to recall the paper's basic pro-&#13;
position that labor markets operate reasonably well.    This guarantees that&#13;
efforts to expand labor demand in a given sector can be expected to exert&#13;
upward pressure on wages in other sectors.&#13;
Industrial trade policy is considered first. Manufactured exports&#13;
are usually more labor-intensive than import substitutes, so that the removal&#13;
of the bias against exports implicit in many import-substitution policies can&#13;
be expected to increase labor demand in the short run. Of more importance,&#13;
however, are the potential long-run benefits. The change in policy can be&#13;
expected to increase total GDP and the return to investment in the industrial&#13;
sector in particular, and in the economy in general, both because the balance&#13;
between imports and exports has been redressed, and because such a policy-&#13;
switch usually implies a movement away from quantitative restrictions.     In the&#13;
long run, therefore, an increase in the economy-wide rate of investment and a&#13;
reallocation of investible resources in favor of industry can be expected.&#13;
The resulting increase in the capital stock will allow an expansion in labor&#13;
demand, and the reallocation of investment flows will hasten the transformation&#13;
of the industrial structure of the labor force.&#13;
Although the direction appears clear, the quantitative impact on&#13;
labor demand is more difficult to discern. In general terms, the impact will&#13;
be large if:&#13;
(a) existing policies are severely biased against exports&#13;
and reliance on quantitative restrictions is heavy;&#13;
(b) complementary factors - physical and human capital -&#13;
are in elastic supply; and&#13;
(c) the initial size of the industrial sector is significant&#13;
relative to the rest of the domestic economy but not rela-&#13;
tive to the international economy.&#13;
This suggests that, for one reason or another, the rationalization of indus-&#13;
trial trade policy, although to be encouraged on efficiency grounds, is&#13;
unlikely to have a significant effect on labor demand in most low-income Asian&#13;
and African countries. Favorable employment consequences will be (and in&#13;
several cases have been) more substantial in the middle-income countries.&#13;
The low-income countries have more to gain from redressing the&#13;
balance between agriculture and industry and encouraging small-scale agri-&#13;
culture. Agriculture can be highly labor intensive; it also remains the most&#13;
important source of employment in low-income countries. Agricultural growth,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
therefore, can be expected to have a substantial impact on labor demand.&#13;
Pricing policies which discriminate against agriculture in general, and&#13;
agricultural labor in particular, should be modified. This includes policies&#13;
which have turned the internal terms of trade against agriculture as well as&#13;
policies which have reduced the cost of capital, especially tractors, relative&#13;
to wages. At the same time, small-scale agriculture must be assured stability&#13;
of tenure and equal access to credit, the water-seed-fertilizer technology,&#13;
and markets. Finally, the need for further technological advances suggests&#13;
that research efforts will have to be redoubled.&#13;
Serious efforts to promote agricultural growth in the low-income&#13;
countries will, of course, serve to retard the transformation in the industrial&#13;
structure of the labor force. They will do so, however, only to the extent&#13;
that they raise labor's supply price to the industrial sector. This is a&#13;
desirable consequence both from an efficiency and an equity perspective.&#13;
The final factor examined on the demand side is the efficiency of&#13;
capital markets. This has two aspects. First, in the short-run, the elim-&#13;
ination of policy-induced distortions - interest ceilings and subsidized&#13;
credit - will improve the efficiency of resource allocation. As argued above,&#13;
this can be expected to have a substantial impact on the demand for agri-&#13;
cultural labor. The effect on industrial labor demand, however, is ambiguous;&#13;
it will depend on the technological characteristics of production in the&#13;
previously segmented markets. Second, in the long-run, the improvement in&#13;
resource allocation will yield an increase in GDP which, in turn, will result&#13;
in higher levels of savings. Savings mobilization can also be improved by&#13;
expanding the array of financial assets and services and reducing transaction&#13;
costs in the capital market. An expansion of savings will allow a correspond-&#13;
ing expansion in the capital stock and should, therefore, unambiguously&#13;
increase labor demand.&#13;
Much of the discussion of demand factors, therefore, is concerned&#13;
with the dynamic consequences of improvements in resource allocation. Improve-&#13;
ments in the allocation of resources within agriculture may well constitute&#13;
the sole instance of a potentially substantial short-run employment benefit&#13;
especially in the low-income countries. Apart from this, it is asserted that&#13;
the main benefit in terms of labor demand of a more efficient allocation of&#13;
resources arises, not from sectoral changes in the distribution of a given&#13;
quantity of investible resour,ces, but from the dynamic ramifications of the&#13;
resulting increased rate of capital accumulation.&#13;
Only two factors are considered on the supply side - education and&#13;
population policy. With respect to education, developments in both the market&#13;
for educated labor and the market for education are relevant. The former has&#13;
been characterized by excess supply and the latter by excess demand. The&#13;
excess supply of educated labor reflects the slowness of labor market adjust-&#13;
ment relative to the rapidly changing supply conditions. Wage-rate adjustments&#13;
and a downward revision of job expectations may gradually eliminate the&#13;
excess, but only at the cost of reducing the return to education. The excess&#13;
demand for education reflects the general practice of public subsidies as well&#13;
as education's dual role as a consumption and an investment good.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- vi -&#13;
These arguments suggest that plans for the expansion of secondary&#13;
education should be carefully reviewed in the light of the expected decline&#13;
in future returns. The gap between formal secondary education and specific&#13;
job requirements should also be bridged by the provision of vocational training&#13;
establishments which are responsive to labor market developments. Curtailment&#13;
of secondary-level expansion, however, will exacerbate the problem of excess&#13;
demand for education. The use of the price mechanism (school fees) may be&#13;
politically acceptable in some countries but even full-cost pricing may be&#13;
insufficient to eliminate all excess demand if education really is a con-&#13;
sumption good. In most countries, nonprice rationing of limited secondary&#13;
school places will be necessary for many years to come.&#13;
In discussions of employment issues, population programs are fre-&#13;
quently ignored on the grounds that for short-term policy-making the future&#13;
-labor force can be treated as given. For example, if LDC fertility rates had&#13;
been halved in 1975, the male labor force would not have been affected for&#13;
fifteen years and by 2000 would only have been reduced by one-eighth. The&#13;
reduction, however, would be concentrated in the under-25 age group; by 2000&#13;
the male labor force under age 25 would have been halved and it is precisely&#13;
this group which has suffered most from unemployment. From a medium and&#13;
long-term point of view population policy is crucial.&#13;
Unfortunately, many of the countries currently experiencing high&#13;
rates of population growth are among the poorest in the world and seem least&#13;
inclined to initiate population programs. Most low-income African and Asian&#13;
countries (with the notable exceptions of India, Indonesia and Sri Lanka) have&#13;
hardly begun to implement family planning programs. Of the middle-income&#13;
countries, many in Latin America are experiencing annual population growth&#13;
rates close to or in excess of 3 percent but have not initiated population&#13;
programs. Obviously, these programs have costs and benefits which can only be&#13;
identified in a country-specific context; nevertheless, from the present, more&#13;
aggregative perspective, population control emerges as one of the most import-&#13;
ant long-run means of increasing the return to labor and advancing the trans-&#13;
formation in the industrial structure of the labor force.&#13;
Commentary&#13;
Implementation of the above policies can be expected to improve&#13;
resource allocation, increase the demand for labor, enhance labor force skills&#13;
and levels of education, and, in the long run, reduce the supply of labor.&#13;
The degree of success as measured by increases in labor's supply price,&#13;
however, will vary among countries depending on resource and other constraints.&#13;
In some countries, the optimal package of policies, even if it could be&#13;
defined and implemented, could not be expected to yield substantial increases&#13;
in labor's supply price; countries are poor not only because of inappropriate&#13;
policies. Nevertheless, whatever the magnitude of the improvement, the&#13;
recommended policies can be expected to yield some improvement in the return&#13;
to labor and should, therefore, be pursued.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
PART I: STATISTICAL OVERVIEW&#13;
The process of economic development in the now-developed countries&#13;
of the world has been characterised by a major transformation in the industrial&#13;
structure of the labor force. In particular, as shown in Table 1, the share&#13;
of the labor force employed in agriculture has declined from nearly 50 percent&#13;
in 1900 to around 20 percent in 1960. In addition to a corresponding increase&#13;
of its total share, changes within the non-agricultural labor force are marked&#13;
by an expansion in services relative to industry: thus in 1900 29 and 23&#13;
percent of the labor force were in industry and services respectively compared&#13;
with 36 and 41 percent in 1960. 1/&#13;
Clark (1957) has attributed this pattern of structural transformation&#13;
to underlying changes in the composition of demand associated with increasing&#13;
incomes and to intersectoral variations in the rate of growth of labor product-&#13;
ivity. In short, Clark argued that as income per capita increases, "the&#13;
relative demand for agricultural products falls all the time, and ... the&#13;
relative demand for manufacture first rises, and then falls in favor of&#13;
services" (Clark, 1957, p. 493), and that "real product per man-hour in&#13;
manufacture ... nearly always advances at a greater rate than real product per&#13;
man-hour in other sectors of the economy" (Clark, 1957, p. 494). Together,&#13;
the two tendencies adequately account for the observed change in the structure&#13;
of the labor force. 2/&#13;
The recent historical experience of the now-developing countries,&#13;
however, is quite different in two respects. First, agriculture accounts for&#13;
a much larger, albeit declining, share of the total labor force; Table 1&#13;
reveals that as late as 1960 agriculture still accounted for more than 70&#13;
percent of the labor force. And second, within the non-agricultural sector,&#13;
services have consistently accounted for a considerably larger proportion of&#13;
the labor force than industry: for example, in 1950 services employed 63&#13;
percent of the non-agricultural labor force compared to 37 percent in industry.&#13;
Thus, the less developed countries have a much larger share of their labor&#13;
force in the non-industrial sectors than did the now-developed countries in&#13;

variety of sources, are subject to considerable margins of error and&#13;
should only be used to indicate broad trends. The details of estimation&#13;
and the sources used are reported fully in Bairoch, Deldycke, Gelders and&#13;

hunting and fishing; "industry" covers mining and quarrying, manufactur-&#13;

sectors, namely, commerce, transport, storage and communication and&#13;
services proper.&#13;

Moreover, many of the less developed countries are also experiencing&#13;
unusually high rates of open unemployment. An extensive study of the data&#13;
available in 1970 indicated rates of urban unemployment in excess of 10 percent&#13;
in several less developed countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America (Turnham,&#13;
1971).&#13;

Such high rates of unemployment and such large numbers remaining in&#13;
the low-productivity sectors are generally attributed to the failure of the&#13;
high-productivity, industrial sector to provide adequate employment oppor-&#13;
tunities. 1/ This section presents a statistical overview of these issues&#13;
with the specific objectives of both assessing their dimensions and identify-&#13;
ing their underlying causes. The analysis proceeds by means of a comparison&#13;
initially between developed countries circa 1900 and developing countries&#13;
circa 1960 and then among groups of developing countries today. The first&#13;
comparison pinpoitits the major factors which could account for the differences&#13;
in the structural changes experienced by developed countries historically and&#13;
by developing countries currently, while the second comparison emphasizes the&#13;
variation of experience among developing countries. Finally, the available&#13;
evidence on unemployment is examined and the analytical significance of a&#13;
number of different concepts of underemployment is discussed.&#13;
Chapter 1: An Historical Comparison&#13;
Much can be gleaned from a comparison of the industrialization&#13;
experience of the now-developed countries with the current situation of&#13;
today's less developed countries. As will become apparent, the main lessons&#13;
emerge not from the similarities of experience but from the major contrasts.&#13;
On the supply side, the evidence reveals marked differences in population&#13;
growth rates and educational attainments; as a result, today's development&#13;
efforts must contend with high rates of labor force growth, increasingly&#13;
better educated new entrants to the labor market, higher dependency ratios and&#13;
rapid rates of urbanization. And on the demand side, several characteristics&#13;
of the high productivity sector observed in today's LDCs, especially its small&#13;
share of the labor force, its much faster rates of output and productivity&#13;
growth and its relative skill intensity, differ noticeably from the historical&#13;
experience of the developed countries. These differences are documented&#13;
below.&#13;
Factors Operating on the Supply Side&#13;
Table 2 records growth rates for total population, labor force and&#13;
urban population for developing and developed countries since 1800. The&#13;
single most important conclusion to be drawn from Table 2 is that the LDCs are&#13;
experiencing population growth rates three times as large as those encountered&#13;
by the DCs. Thus, throughout the 19th century annual population growth was&#13;
only 0.8 percent in the DCs compared with 2.4 percent in the LDCs for the&#13;
period 1950-70. A population growing at an annual rate of 0.8 percent doubles&#13;
in 86 years; a population growing at 2.4 percent a year doubles in only 29&#13;
years.&#13;
1/   This view has been expressed by, among others, Baer and Herve (1966) and&#13;
Morawetz (1974).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
Different population growth rates have different implications for&#13;
labor force participation. As a result of the low birth and death rates in&#13;
the DCs, for example, their population has been aging. This, together with&#13;
the extension of retirement schemes and the rise in school attendance rates,&#13;
has led to a declining participation rate. The decline, however, has been&#13;
slight, the participation rate falling from 45 percent in 1900 to 40 percent&#13;
in 1960 (Bairoch and Limbor, 1968, Table 1). In the LDCs, on the other hand,&#13;
the low mortality rates are coupled with extremely high fertility rates and a&#13;
consequent broadening of the base of the age pyramid (see Table 3). While&#13;
variation among LDCs is marked, the overall result has also been a decline in&#13;
the participation rate from 43 percent in 1900 to 38 percent in 1960 reflecting&#13;
the increasing share of inactive children in the total population (Bairoch and&#13;
Limbor, 1968, Table 1). 1/&#13;
The declining participation rates during the 20th century are re-&#13;
flected in the growth rates of the labor force (shown in Table 2) which are&#13;
consistently below the corresponding population growth rates. Nevertheless,&#13;
during the period 1950-1970 the annual-rate of growth of the labor force in&#13;
the LDCs was 1.7 percent compared with a rate of around 0.9 percent experienced&#13;
by the DCs throughout the 19th century. Thus, the LDCs have to cope with a&#13;
rate of growth of the labor force almost twice as large as that experienced by&#13;
the DCs during their period of industralization.&#13;
Apart from the differences in the growth rates of total population&#13;
and labor force, LDCs and DCs have also experienced very different patterns of&#13;
change in the spatial distribution of their populations. During the period&#13;
1850 to 1920 the urban population in the DCs increased at an annual rate of&#13;
2.5 percent, over three times faster than the rate of increase of total&#13;
population. In the period 1920-1960, however, the urban population of the&#13;
LDCs increased at an annual rate of over 4 percent; during the decade of the&#13;
1950s it increased at the unprecedented rate of 5.1 percent which, although&#13;
considerably larger than the corresponding DC rate, is, nevertheless, only&#13;
twice the growth rate of total LDC population.&#13;
A further aspect of the disparity in population growth rates is the&#13;
consequent difference in the age structure of the population. Table 3 reveals&#13;
that the LDCs of 1960 had over 60 percent of their population below the age of&#13;
25 compared to less than 50 percent for the DCs in 1900. Such a "young"&#13;
population as that observed for the LDCs can be expected to have at least two&#13;
economic consequences. First, the dependency ratio 2/ will be larger; thus,&#13;
from Table 3 every member of the LDC population of working age has to support&#13;
0.8 dependents whereas his DC counterpart had less than 0.6 dependents. And&#13;
second, the new entrants to the labor market will outnumber those in the older&#13;
1/   Participation rates in the developing countries are subject to con-&#13;
siderable margins of error, mainly as a result of differences among&#13;
countries in the treatment of unpaid family workers especially females.&#13;
This point is examined below.&#13;
2/   The dependency ratio shows the number of dependents (those under 15 or&#13;
over 65) per member of the population of working age (15 to 65).&#13;

age brackets by an increasingly large margin. For example, both the DCs and&#13;
the LDCs have roughly the same percentage of their population in the age group&#13;
15 to 24 when workers are first entering the labor market; the share of the&#13;
LDC population in the age group 45 to 64, however, is only 70 percent of that&#13;
in the DCs. It follows that the expansion of jobs must be much faster in LDCs&#13;
than DCs if the new entrants to the labor force are to be fully employed.&#13;
This last point is, of course, simply another way of saying that the&#13;
rate of gfowth of the labor force in today's LDCs exceeds that experienced by&#13;
yesterday's DCs. This form of presentation, however, takes on added sig-&#13;
nificance when it is related to the second factor which distinguishes LDC and&#13;
DC experience, namely, the rapid growth of educational facilities.&#13;

The evidence documented in Table 4 reveals that at the primary level,&#13;
15 percent of the DC population of 1900 attended school. Compulsory primary&#13;
education became more or less general towards the end of the 19th century, so&#13;
that rates of expansion (1.6 percent ) began to reflect population growth. In&#13;
the LDCs, however, only 8 percent of the 1960 population attended primary&#13;
school but the annual rate of expansion was more than 5 percent.     At the&#13;
secondary level the situation is very different: although only 0.4 percent of&#13;
the DC population attended secondary school in 1900, compared with 1.6 percent&#13;
in the LDCs of 1960, their annual rates of expansion (8.0 percent) were very&#13;
similar. Primary education in the LDCs, therefore, has been increasing more&#13;
rapidly but from a lower base than in the DCs, whereas secondary education has&#13;
been growing at the same rate but from a higher base.&#13;
Clearly, the rapid expansion of educational attainment in the LDCs&#13;
must be reflected in an increased number of educated entrants to the labor&#13;
markets. It follows that not only are first-time entrants to the labor market&#13;
much more numerous than those withdrawing from the market, they have also&#13;
received much more formal education. In other words, while the quantity of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
new jobs required is increasing as a result of population growth, the quality&#13;
of the required jobs is also likely to be increasing as a result of the&#13;
expansion in educational facilties. On the basis of this analysis, it is&#13;
not altogether surprising that many LDCs are experiencing high rates of&#13;
unemployment for those with primary or secondary education.&#13;
Factors Operating on the Demand Side&#13;
An important source of difference on the demand side between today's&#13;
LDCs and yesterday's DCs lies in their respective shares of employment in&#13;
industry: in 1960 slightly more than 10 percent of the LDC labor force was&#13;
engaged in industry compared to almost 30 percent in the DCs in 1900. A more&#13;
detailed breakdown of the labor force, shown in Table 5, reveals clearly that,&#13;
while the distribution of labor within services as well as the total share of&#13;
the labor force in the service sector in the LDCs of 1960 are not dissimilar&#13;
to those of the DCs in 1900, the distribution between agriculture and industry&#13;
is very different.   Thus, the main structural difference between today's LDCs&#13;
and yesterday's DCs lies in the relatively immature development of the indus-&#13;
trial sector in the former group of countries.    A transfer of 15 percent of&#13;
the LDC labor force from agriculture to industry would yield a sectoral&#13;
distribution of the labor force almost identical to that of the DCs in 1900.&#13;

Given that the share of the labor force in industry in DCs circa&#13;
1900 was more than twice that of LDCs circa 1960, if industry is to make&#13;
the same relative contribution to the absorption of labor in both cases, the&#13;
growth rate of the industrial labor force in the LDCs must be at least twice&#13;
that of the DCs. Table 6 reveals that the growth of the industrial labor&#13;
force in LDCs was in fact more than twice that achieved historically by the&#13;
DCs. Thus, contrary to popular assertion, the industrial sector of today's&#13;
LDCs has absorbed labor at rates similar to those in the DCs of yesterday.&#13;
What then prompts the view that the industrial sector of today's&#13;
LDCs has been an inadequate source of employment for labor? The answer&#13;
usually given is that compared with the rate of industrial output growth&#13;
achieved by today's LDCs the absorption of labor has been disappointingly&#13;
slow. Table 7 assembles the relevant available data on this particular&#13;
issue. The data, which have been drawn from a variety of sources, are not&#13;
precisely comparable. Nevertheless, the regularity of growth rate patterns&#13;
observed at the individual country level suggests that the differences in&#13;
reported growth rates do reflect real phenomena and not simply statistical&#13;
deficiencies. With this in mind, the Table reveals that industrial output&#13;
growth has been very much faster in today's LDCs (over 8 percent) than in&#13;
yesterday's DCs (less than 4 percent). Doubling output in today's LDCs&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
takes about 10 years; it took 20 years in the DCs of yesterday. The ratio of&#13;
industrial labor force growth to industrial output growth, however, is higher&#13;
in today's LDCs (0.46) than in yesterday's DCs (0.40); that is, both output&#13;
and labor force growth in the industrial sector of LDCs in the 1960s exceeded&#13;
that achieved historically by the DCs, but the relative difference is greater&#13;
with respect to the labor force than with respect to output.&#13;

except, Brazil, Vietnam and Zaire (lack of data). The reported mean&#13;
is the unweighted average of individual country growth rates. Standard&#13;
deviations are reported in parentheses. The corresponding annual growth&#13;
rates computed from the World Bank global projection model are 2.7 per-&#13;
cent for agriculture, 7.6 percent for industry and 6.7 percent for&#13;
services (World Bank, 1979,a).&#13;

sectoral labor force reported in Table 6. The growth rates of&#13;
output reported in footnote 2 above and the labor force growth rates&#13;
reported in footnote 3 of Table 6, yield growth rates of productivity&#13;
of 1.5 percent for agriculture, 4.6 percent for industry and 2.2 per-&#13;
cent for services. Thus, although there is some variation, the broad&#13;
pattern is very similar to that shown above.&#13;

The historical comparison, then, suggests that critics of the indus-&#13;
trial sector's achievements with regard to labor absorption have been too&#13;
harsh: the low initial share of the LDC labor force in industry is more than&#13;
offset by its higher growth rate. Nevertheless, the critics remain correct&#13;
in one important respect: as shown in Table 7 the rate of growth of labor&#13;
productivity has been considerably higher in the LDCs than in the DCs in all&#13;
sectors. The data are consistent with the view that the technology being&#13;
adopted by LDCs differed substantially from that used by the DCs during this&#13;
phase of their industrialization. For example, the DCs achieved a growth rate&#13;
for labor productivity in industry of just over 2 percent, whereas the LDCs&#13;
are currently achieving a growth rate of more than 4 percent. 1/ Had produc-&#13;
tivity grown at 2 percent in today's LDCs rather than the observed 4 percent&#13;
the rate of growth of the labor force in industry, it is argued, would have&#13;
been 2 percent higher. It is in this sense, then, that the labor absorption&#13;
record of the industrial sector is generally faulted. A lower rate of produc-&#13;
tivity growth, however, does not necessarily mean a higher rate of labor&#13;
absorption because output growth may be reduced. Moreover, even in the&#13;
arithmetic sense, it will be shown below that an increase of 2 percent in&#13;
the growth of the industrial labor force has little impact on the overall&#13;
composition of the labor force.&#13;
If the higher rate of growth in industrial labor productivity&#13;
achieved by the LDCs can indeed be attributed to improved technology, the&#13;
qualitative composition of the industrial labor force can also be expected&#13;
to be different from that of yesterday's DCs; more advanced technology&#13;
requires greater complements of higher quality labor. A comparison of the&#13;
occupational structure of the labor force in today's LDCs and yesterday's&#13;
DCs may not be very revealing, however, because of the dominance of the agri-&#13;
cultural force in the LDCs. For the purpose in hand, therefore, it may be&#13;
more appropriate to confine the analysis to Latin America, because in terms&#13;
of the structure of the labor force Latin American countries are the most&#13;
advanced. Table 8 presents a comparision between the USA in 1870 and Latin&#13;
America in 1950. The distributions of the broad occupational groups 2/&#13;
adopted here are seen to be roughly similar for the two regions at the stated&#13;
points in their respective developments. The significance of Table 8, however,&#13;
is the difference in the changes in the composition of the labor force.&#13;
Unlike the USA, which experienced a rapid expansion in blue collar workers&#13;
during the period 1870-1920, Latin America experienced a very low rate of&#13;
expansion between 1950 and 1961. In fact, the expansion of blue collar&#13;
1/   As noted above, historical data must be treated with caution.     Other&#13;
studies, however, confirm the orders of magnitude reported here. For&#13;
example, Phelps Brown calculates annual rates of industrial productivity&#13;
increase of 2.2, 2.3, 0.36 and 1.6 percent in Germany, Sweden, U.K. and&#13;
U.S.A. respectively circa 1900 (Phelps Brown, 1973, Table II).&#13;
2/   "White collar" includes professionals, technicians and administrative&#13;
and clerical workers; "blue collar" includes craftsmen, operators,&#13;
transport and communications workers and miners; "unskilled" includes&#13;
farmers, service and manual workers and others.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
workers in Latin America is more like the recent, rather than the historical,&#13;
experience of the U.S.A. One plausible explanation is that Latin America is&#13;
by-passing the phase of rapid expansion in blue collar workers which has been&#13;
observed historically because its industrialization is based on a very dif-&#13;
ferent technology. The proportion of white collar workers, however, has&#13;
expanded quite rapidly in Latin America, but this reflects the increased use&#13;
of high quality labor, not only in industry, but also in services especially&#13;
in the public sector.&#13;

The historically evidence, then, indicates that the growth of the&#13;
industrial sector both in terms of output and employment has been much faster&#13;
in the LDCs than was ever achieved in the DCs. Moreover, there is evidence&#13;
from Latin America, at least, to suggest that a higher quality labor is&#13;
required by today's LDCs than was required by yesterday's DCs. Both the rapid&#13;
productivity increase and the higher skill intensity of LDC industry are con-&#13;
sistent with the view that technological developments have changed the nature&#13;
of the industrialization process substantially.&#13;
Implications for the Transformation of the Labor Force&#13;
Of the various factors considered thus far, population growth,&#13;
through its impact on the growth of the labor force, emerges as the single&#13;
most important variable in the analysis. This may be demonstrated in an&#13;
arithmetic sense by assessing the relative importance of the various factors&#13;
underlying the difference in the growth rates of the non-industrial labor&#13;
force in the DCs circa 1900 and the LDCs circa 1960. Thus, the 1.8 percent&#13;
rate of growth of the LDC labor force less the product of industry's share&#13;
in employment (0.1) and the difference between the rates of growth of indus-&#13;
trial output (8.4 percent) and productivity (4.6 percent) yields a growth&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
rate of 1.4 percent for the non-industrial labor force. 1/ The corresponding&#13;
figure for DCs is 0.6 percent. If the DC labor force growth rate is then&#13;
substituted for the LDC labor force growth rate, the rate of growth of the&#13;
LDC non-industrial labor force falls from 1.4 to 0.5 percent; that is, the&#13;
difference between the growth of the non-industrial labor force in DCs and&#13;
LDCs is more than accounted for by differences in total labor force growth&#13;
rates and hence population growth rates. On the other hand, if the growth&#13;
of LDC productivity is limited to that experienced by the DCs, the growth&#13;
of the non-industrial labor force in the LDCs falls only slightly from 1.4&#13;
to 1.1 percent. At least in an arithmetic sense, then, the difference in&#13;
population growth is clearly the dominant factor.&#13;
Of course, there is no reason to suppose that if population growth&#13;
is reduced everything else will remain the same. Nevertheless, the magnitudes&#13;
involved suggest that the conclusion would not be seriously changed even if&#13;
full allowance were made for all the appropriate interactions. 2/ The major&#13;
lesson of the historical comparison, therefore, is that the relatively slow&#13;
transformation of the sectoral composition of the labor force in the LIDCs&#13;
arises from their rapid rate of population growth and not from a low rate&#13;
of labor absorption, at least by historical standards, in the industrial sector.&#13;
This is not to say, however, that industrial labor absorption could not have&#13;
been faster; 3/ nor is it to say that all problems will be solved simply by&#13;
reducing the fertility rate, if only because the effect of such an action takes&#13;
at least fifteen years to have any impact on the labor force. It does, however,&#13;
suggest that population policy is a crucial component of any long term strategy&#13;
designed to effect a major transformation in the industrial structure of the&#13;
labor force in today's LDCs.&#13;
The historical analysis also highlights the extent to which the LDCs&#13;
are compressing the development process. The growth rates of total product,&#13;
of industrial output and employment, and of school attendence are well in&#13;
excess of those achieved historically. Such rapid changes can be expected to&#13;
exert unusual pressure on the labor market; any inflexibility in this market&#13;
during a phase of such dramatic transformation and development must inevitably&#13;
lead to serious consequences for the employment of the labor force.&#13;

Chapter 2: A Cross-Sectional Analysis&#13;
Apart from historical differences between DCs and LDCs, variation&#13;
among LDCs is also significant. The statistical overview continues, therefore,&#13;
with an examination of differences among broad groups of LDCs with respect to&#13;
such factors as population growth, labor force structure, levels of education,&#13;
productivity and real wages. Countries are grouped either by regions or by&#13;
GDP per capita depending upon the availability of data. In general, the dif-&#13;
ferences among groups of LDCs are less marked than those emerging from the&#13;
historical analysis; nevertheless, significant differences are observed in&#13;
labor force growth rates, in the industrial, educational and occupational&#13;
strucutures of the labor force and in levels and growth rates of sectoral&#13;
productivity. Regional differences in growth rates of real wages are also&#13;
identified but the underlying data are severely limited both in coverage and&#13;
reliability.&#13;
Population and Labor Force&#13;
The regional population growth rates reported in Table 9 for the&#13;
period 1960 to 1970 lie between 1.4 percent in Southern Europe and 2.9 percent&#13;
in East Asia. 1/ The main determinant of future population growth is the&#13;
expected level of fertility. Mortality decline will not be an important&#13;
factor in future population growth. In parts of Latin America and East Asia&#13;
mortality rates are already approaching those of the developed countries.      In&#13;
Low Income Asia mortality is relatively higher, but, given its current level,&#13;
future declines will have a smaller impact on population than in the past.&#13;
Although mortality remains a major demographic problem in Africa, prospects&#13;
for a rapid decline are dim.&#13;
With respect to fertility, declines have occurred in East Asia (for&#13;
example, Malaysia, Taiwan and Singapore) and in some Low Income Asian (India,&#13;
Sri Lanka and Indonesia) and Latin American countries (Argentina, Colombia,&#13;
Uruguay, Chile). Many of the remaining Asian and Latin American countries and&#13;
virtually all countries in Africa (the main exceptions being the Arab Republic&#13;
of Egypt and Tunisia) have either experienced constant levels of fertility or&#13;
else modest declines.&#13;
Labor force growth is determined mainly by past population growth,&#13;
the lag being of the order of fifteen years. If follows that the increasing&#13;
rates of population growth in Sub-Saharan Africa, Low Income Asia and the&#13;
Middle East and North Africa shown in Table 9 have yet to be reflected in&#13;
their respective labor force growth rates. The recent rates of labor force&#13;
growth reported for Sub-Saharan Africa (2.1 percent), Low Income Asia (1.7&#13;
percent), and Middle East and North Africa (1.9 percent), although high by&#13;
historical standards, will be surpassed in the 1980s and 1990s, as will the&#13;
very high rates (2.4 percent) reported for Latin America and the Carribean.&#13;
1/   This and the subsequent paragraph are based on Cassen (1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
Changing rates of labor force participation may modify this outcome&#13;
but, as shown in Table 9, the observed and projected decreases in participa-&#13;
tion rates are not great. 1/ Regardless of the level of development, nearly&#13;
all males in the age group 25 to 55 are in the labor force. 2/ In the early&#13;
stages of economic growth and industrialization there is a fairly rapid&#13;
decline in the participation rates of those under 20 or over 65, but subse-&#13;
quent decline in the male crude participation rate is slight. 3/ Ranking&#13;
countries according to an index based on energy consumption per capita and&#13;
the share of the labor force in nonagricultural activities, Durand (1975)&#13;
reports that the participation rates for the age group 15-19 and for those&#13;
over 65 are 75.5 and 63.4 percent respectively in the least-developed&#13;
quintile of countries (according to his index) compared with corresponding&#13;
rates of 61.6 and 29.5 percent in the most developed quintile. 4/ Weighting&#13;
age-specific activity rates by the 1960 age structure of the world population,&#13;
Durand shows that the male standardized participation rate declines from 81.0&#13;
percent for the least-developed quintile of countries to 73.1 percent for&#13;
the most developed quintile, the unweighted mean for all countries (100)&#13;
being 76.8 percent.&#13;
Secular trends in female labor force participation rates are less&#13;
easily discerned, mainly because cross-sectional comparisons reveal enormous&#13;
differences. In part, this may reflect statistical deficiencies rather than&#13;
real differences. For example, the Algerian census of 1966 reported 23,315&#13;
female agricultural workers, whereas the census authorities estimated that&#13;
an additional 1,200,000 females were actually engaged in agricultural work.&#13;
The 1954 census, in fact, reported a female participation rate of 25.2 percent&#13;
compared to the 1.8 percent reported in 1966. Inclusion of the "missing"&#13;
1,200,000 females increases the 1966 figure to 21.7 percent. 5/ Some of&#13;
the very low rates reported for Moslem countries may well reflect under-&#13;
enumeration.&#13;
1/   For extensive surveys of participation rates in LDCs see Durand (1975),&#13;
Standing (1978,a), Denti (1968) and Hartman (1977).&#13;
2/   Rates in excess of 95 percent are recorded almost universally for males&#13;
between 30 and 44 (Durand, 1975, p. 148).&#13;
3/   The crude participation rate is determined by the joint influence of&#13;
age-specific participation rates and the age structure of the popula-&#13;
tion.&#13;
4/   The country grouping is described in Durand (1975), Appendix H.    The&#13;
least-developed quintile includes such countries as Pakistan, Zaire,&#13;
Bolivia, and Sierra Leone, while the most-developed quintile includes&#13;
U.S.A., Canada and Denmark among others. Observations are for 1960.&#13;

Standing (1978,a) suggests the following fourfold classification of&#13;
countries according to urban and rural female labor force participation rates:&#13;
(a) Arab countries - low rates in both urban and rural areas.&#13;
(b) Latin America - low rural rates and high urban rates.&#13;
(c) Africa and India - high rural rates and low urban rates.&#13;
(d) South-east Asia - high rural and urban rates.&#13;
With development, low and high rates tend to converge. The net result in LDCs&#13;
treated as a group has been a very modest decline since 1945 in female parti-&#13;
cipation rates (Standing, 1978,a).&#13;
Recent historical experience, therefore, suggests that, although&#13;
the male participation rate may decline further, the impact of changing&#13;
participation rates on the growth rate of the labor force will be negligible&#13;
compared with that of population growth. The resulting increments in the&#13;
labor force (shown in Table 9) are unprecedented: between 1970 and 2000 the&#13;
labor force in Low Income Asia is projected to increase by over 270 million&#13;
to approximately 620 million; although less daunting the increases in Sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa (120 million) and Latin America and the Caribbean (110 million)&#13;
are nevertheless sizeable.&#13;
Industrial Structure of the Labor Force&#13;
Changes in the industrial structure of the labor force between 1950&#13;
and 1970 are reported in Table 10. In 1950, Low Income Africa and Asia still&#13;
had 90 and 75 percent respectively of their labor forces engaged in agriculture;&#13;
apart from East Asian and Pacific and Sub-Saharan countries, the Middle Income&#13;
countries were considerably more developed in this respect, agriculture's share&#13;
of the total labor force having already fallen to around 60 percent or less.&#13;
All groups experienced some degree of transformation in the indus-&#13;
trial structure of their labor force between 1950 and 1970. In the Low Income&#13;
countries the share of the labor force in agriculture declined by only 3&#13;
percentage points between 1950 and 1970, whereas the Middle Income countries&#13;
secured a reduction of around 15 percent in agriculture's share of the labor&#13;
force, about two-thirds of the decline being absorbed in the service sector.&#13;
A number of statistical studies have identified the general pattern&#13;
of change in the industrial structure of the labor force during the process&#13;
of development. Chenery and Syrquin (1975), for example, regress the sectoral&#13;
shares of the labor force on GDP per capita and population. For a country&#13;
with a population of ten million and per capita GDP of US$500 in 1964, their&#13;
estimates show that the partial elasticity of agriculture's share in the labor&#13;
force with respect to per capita GDP is -0.05. The corresponding elasticities&#13;
for industry and services are 0.39 and 0.27. 1/ These figures indicate that,&#13;

given the structure of the labor force at this level of development, an&#13;
increase in GDP per capita is associated with a decline in agriculture's share&#13;
of the labor force which is absorbed in almost exactly equal proportions by&#13;
industry and services.&#13;
Educational and Occupational Structure of the Labor Force&#13;
The educational and occupational structures of the labor force&#13;
are also observed to change in the process of economic development. This&#13;
is illustrated in Table 11 for a 1960 cross section of countries grouped&#13;
by productivity per worker. In the high productivity group, 1/ over 90&#13;
percent of the labor force have completed primary school, and nearly 10&#13;
percent are classified as professionals or technicians. In the low pro-&#13;
ductivity group, 2/ however, less than 25 percent of the labor force have&#13;
completed primary education and less than three percent are in the pro-&#13;
fessional and technical category.&#13;
Statistical analysis reveals the relationship between productivity&#13;
per worker and the educational and occupational structures of the labor&#13;
force more clearly. Regressions relating the share of the labor force at&#13;
selected educational levels to productivity per worker yield elasticities&#13;
of 0.9 for higher and secondary education and 0.75 for primary education.&#13;
Similar exercises relating occupational shares to productivity reveal&#13;
elasticities of 0.5 for professional and clerical occupations, 0.6 for&#13;
administrative occupations and 0.2 for sales occupations (Layard and&#13;
Saigal, 1966).&#13;
Of course, not all countries fit the statistical relationships&#13;
equally well. Japan, for example, lies in the medium productivity group&#13;
in Table 11 but has an educational structure akin to that of the high&#13;
productivity group. Chile illustrates the opposite case: it is a high&#13;
productivity country with the educational structure of a medium productivity&#13;
country. Similarly, low productivity countries such as Korea and the&#13;
Philippines should be ranked with medium productivity countries according to&#13;
their educational structures, whereas Peru, although included in the medium&#13;
productivity group, has a "low-productivity" educational structure.&#13;
Changes over time in the educational structure of the labor force&#13;
are clearly supply-induced, and depend solely on the expansion in educational&#13;
facilities. Recent changes in age specific enrollment rates are reported in&#13;
Table 12. By 1975 even low income countries enjoyed enrollment rates in&#13;
excess of 55 percent for primary education and 20 percent for secondary educa-&#13;
tion. For all LDCs, the enrollment rate at secondary level almost doubled&#13;
between 1960 and 1975. Changes at the tertiary level were even more dramatic:&#13;
over the same period the enrollment ratio almost tripled.&#13;

Changes in the occupational structure of the labor force, however,&#13;
will depend on both supply and demand factors. The changes observed between&#13;
1960 and 1970 are reported in Table 13 for countries grouped according to&#13;
GDP per capita. All groups experienced an increase in the share of the labor&#13;
force in white collar jobs and a decrease in the share in "other" jobs. The&#13;
two low-income groups also increased the share of their labor force in blue&#13;
collar jobs, whereas the high income group reduced its share. This is a&#13;
further manifestation of technology's impact on the composition of labor&#13;
demand: more advanced technologies require fewer blue collar workers. To&#13;
the extent that LDC industrialization is based on DC technology, the changes&#13;
in the occupational structure of the labor force observed in Latin America&#13;
and reported in Table 8 will be duplicated elsewhere.&#13;

Oberai (1978), Table 6.&#13;
Productivity and Real Wage Rates&#13;
The rate of change in labor's share of GDP equals the difference&#13;
between the rates of change in real wages and productivity. An interest&#13;
in the factor distribution of income this presupposes an interest in real&#13;
wage developments and productivity increases. The available data on sectoral&#13;
productivity and real wage rate developments are reported in Tables 14 and 15.&#13;
Table 14 reveals that sectoral productivity differences are gen-&#13;
erally wider in the Low Income countries than in the Middle Income countries,&#13;
and that agriculture is universally the least productive sector. Industry&#13;
has the highest growth rate of productivity in all groups except Low Income&#13;
Africa. Productivity growth in Low Income countries is consistently below&#13;
that in Middle Income countries in both agriculture and industry but not in&#13;
services; thus the observed tendency for GDP per capita to grow faster in&#13;
Middle Income than in Low Income countries is reflected in two out of three&#13;
sectoral productivity growth rates. The employment elasticities (shown in&#13;
parentheses in Table 14) reveal essentially the same pattern: the slower rate&#13;
of productivity increase observed in the Low Income countries is reflected in&#13;
their higher employment elasticities.&#13;

Unfortunately, data on real wages for the same grouping of countries&#13;
are not available. Nevertheless, the data reported in Table 15 suggest that&#13;
at least in industry and agriculture, increases in real wages have probably&#13;
not exceeded productivity increases. Given the differences in coverage and&#13;
period of observation, however, too much weight cannot be placed on compar-&#13;
isons between Tables 14 and 15; in particular, it would be premature to draw&#13;
conclusions concerning labor's share in GDP from this approach.&#13;
Focussing exclusively on Table 15, it is seen that real wages have&#13;
increased in all three sectors in each of the five regions. A simple regres-&#13;
sion of manufacturing on agricultural rates of wage change for a sample of&#13;
twenty-five countries drawn from Table 15 yielded a signficiant coefficient&#13;
of 0.8 indicating a nearly constant proportional relationship (Gregory&#13;
1975). 1/ A similar exercise relating wage-rate changes in agriculture and&#13;
construction indicated an even stronger relationship, the coefficient being&#13;
0.99 (Gregory, 1975). Although not conclusive these results suggest that&#13;
sectoral labor markets may be more closely integrated than is usually&#13;
thought. 2/&#13;
A similar conclusion emerges from multiple regression analysis.&#13;
In one of the few attempts to construct a simultaneous-equation model of&#13;
wage-rate determination, Glytsos (1977) reports a statistically-significant&#13;
coefficient of 0.97 relating the percentage change in manufacturing wages to&#13;
the percentage change in average agricultural income. 3/ At this level of&#13;
aggregation, therefore, the evidence is consistent with the hyopthesis of&#13;
reasonably well-integrated labor markets.&#13;
1/   For the period 1956 to 1964, however, Smith (1969) found no significant&#13;
correlation between manufacturing and agricultural wages in his sample&#13;
of ten countries.&#13;
2/   Intersectoral differences in the level of wages is discussed in Part II&#13;
which is concerned exclusively with the operation of labor markets.&#13;

Table 15 also presents data on rates of growth in sectoral employ-&#13;
ment and GDP per capita, but the level of aggregation precludes the deduction&#13;
of meaningful conclusions. A more detailed study (Bose, 1978) of seven LDCs -&#13;
Kenya, Ghana, Mauritius, Sri Lanka, Korea, Mexico and Uruguay - shows that&#13;
rising real wages are associated with rapidly rising real GDP per capita&#13;
(more than 3 percent) and rapid employment expansion in the non-agricultural&#13;
sectors (Korea and Mexico). Virtual staganation in real wages is associated&#13;
with slow GDP per capita growth (less than 1 percent) and moderate trans-&#13;
formation of the industrial structure of the labor force (Uruguay, Mauritius&#13;
and Ghana). Even in countries (Kenya and Sri Lanka) experiencing moderate&#13;
increases in GDP per capita (around 2 percent) real wages more or less&#13;
stagnated.&#13;
Finally, the last row of Table 15 illustrates regional dispersion&#13;
of average wages in manufacturing.    As might be expected, the Latin American&#13;
and Mediterranean countries exhibit the highest relative wages.     Wages in&#13;
Africa are well below the sample mean but substantially above those in Asia.&#13;
While probably indicative of the general relationship between regional wage&#13;
rates, the doubtful reliability of the underlying data caution against an&#13;
unqualified acceptance of the observed differentials.&#13;
Summary&#13;
The main implications of the cross-sectional analysis for the&#13;
remainder of the paper are as follows:&#13;
(a) Future labor force growth rates will exceed those of the&#13;
recent past because the impact of the high and increasing&#13;
population growth rates experienced in the 1960s and 1970s&#13;
has yet to materialize. The effect of declining partici-&#13;
pation rates is likely to be negligible by comparison.&#13;
(b) Rapid extension in educational output and the possibility&#13;
of a technologically-induced change in the occupational&#13;
structure of labor demand suggest that extreme and unusual&#13;
pressures are being exerted on the labor market.    The ability&#13;
of the labor market to accommodate these changes thus becomes&#13;
a central concern.   These developments also highlight the&#13;
need to allow for sectoral skill differentials when inter-&#13;
preting sectoral wage differentials.&#13;
(c) Trends in sectoral real wages indicate that labor markets&#13;
are not as tightly compartmentalized as some characteriza-&#13;
tions suggest. Efforts to expand labor demand in a given&#13;
sector can be expected, therefore, to exert upward pressure&#13;
on wages in other sectors.&#13;

Chapter 3: Unemployment and Underemployment&#13;
The concepts of unemployment and underemployment have been exten-&#13;
sively debated in the literature on LDCs. It has been pointed out that&#13;
measures of unemployment are more appropriate for DCs where in the main the&#13;
payment and conditions of employment are subject to contractual agreements&#13;
and labor legislation. In such circumstances, it is relatively easy to&#13;
divide the labor force into the mutually exclusive categories of employed and&#13;
unemployed. In LDCs, on the other hand, a small percentage of the labor force&#13;
is engaged in wage employment, the majority being workers on own account or&#13;
unpaid family members. While there is considerable variation among countries,&#13;
Table 16 reveals quite clearly that wage employment accounts for a much larger&#13;
proportion of the labor force in the industrialized countries than in the&#13;
middle and low income countries. 1/ Thus, in a country like Chile where 70%&#13;
of the labor force is in wage employment the open unemployment rate may be&#13;
a good measure of the under-utilization of labor resources. In India or&#13;
Tanzania, however, it is often argued that the rate of open unemployment&#13;
has little significance because formal labor market transactions are rela-&#13;
tively few.&#13;
The in significance of wage employment, on the one hand, and the&#13;
large numbers remaining in low productivity agriculture and services, on the&#13;
other hand, have led some analysts to emphasize the rate of under-employment&#13;
as an additional or more appropriate measure for LDCs. In the following, the&#13;
analytical content of the concepts of unemployment and underemployment is&#13;
investigated and the relevance of these concepts for LDCs is assessed. In&#13;
addition, available estimates of unemployment and underemployment are pre-&#13;
sented and discussed.&#13;
The Analytic Content of Unemploymet and Underemployment&#13;
In analysing employment, unemployment and underemloyment in&#13;
LDCs, the evidence in Table 16 makes clear that explicit allowance must&#13;
be made for self-employment. Accordingly, Figure 1 and the related&#13;
1/   The statistical relationship beween the share (n) of wage employment&#13;
in the total labor force and GDP per capita (y) for 39 countries has&#13;
been computed to be:&#13;
ln  n  =  -130.15 y     -4.41&#13;
(R  = 0.863,     = 0.12. DW  = 2.06)&#13;
Thus, the elasticity of n with respect to y equals 130.15 y&#13;

analysis allow for both wage and self-employment. 1/ The demand curve for&#13;
wage employment is shown as DW D and that for total (wage and self) employ-&#13;
ment as D D T. In the absence oY institutional or other constraints on wage&#13;
determinaTion, equilibrium is achieved at the point of intersection of the&#13;
demand and supply curves. If the supply curve is given by SS, total employ-&#13;
ment is NT, wage employment is Nw, and the return to the self-employed&#13;
exactly equals the market wage W.&#13;
1/   This analysis abstracts from imperfections arising from uncertainty,&#13;
inadequate information flows, and transaction costs; that is, adjustment&#13;
in the labor market is assumed to be instantaneous. The significance&#13;
of this assumption is examined below.&#13;

In this situation underemployent cannot exist if, as is frequently&#13;
the case, it is defined to include those whose earnings lie below a given&#13;
cut-off level. 1/ The equality of the market wage and the return to self-&#13;
employment noted above also implies equality of the private marginal product&#13;
of labor in both wage employment and self-employment and hence rules out the&#13;
possibility of underemployment unless one is prepared to say that all workers&#13;
are undermployed.&#13;
The market for wage labor in LDCs, however, is often thought to be&#13;
subject to a variety of distortions. In particular, assum7 that minimum wage&#13;
legislation leads to the enforcemeyt of a market wage at W . 2/ As a result&#13;
wage employment falls from N , to NW . Assuming that the wage sector employs&#13;
those with the lowest supply prices, 3/ self-employment changes from NW NT&#13;
1    1&#13;
to N    NT&#13;
W    T&#13;
Compared to the previous situation, two important changes have&#13;
occurred. First, a number of workers indicated by U are not prepared to&#13;
accept self-employment but would accept wage employment at the distorted&#13;
wage if it were available; the distortion in the labor market thus produces&#13;
excels supply. 4/ Second, the marginal product in the wage sector (equal&#13;
to W ) now exceeds that achieved in self-employment (Ws); the distortion&#13;
is, therefore, also reflected in sectoral differentials in marginal product.&#13;
The existence of such differentials also admits the possibility of a non-&#13;
trivial estimated of underemployment; the possibility can only be realized,&#13;
however, if a cut-off level for earnings is also specified. For example,&#13;
1/   This is usually known as invisible underemployment and has been advocated&#13;
as the most appropriate measure for use in LDCs by the ILO. See below&#13;
for further discussion.&#13;
2/   In reality the coverage of wage legislation is usually less than complete.&#13;
This does not, however, affect the substance of the present argument&#13;
although it is clearly of importance when assessing the impact of wage&#13;
legisltation empirically.&#13;
3/   Given the distortion there is, of course, a much larger number of&#13;
workers seeking employment at the distorted wage than there are-jobs.&#13;
It follows that, if the wage sector employs those whose supply price&#13;
exceeds WV, excess supply will be lower but intersectoral productivity&#13;
differentials will be larger. Obviously, there exists an infinite&#13;
number of possible combinations of excess supply and sectoral pro-&#13;
ductivity differentials but the particular outcome does not affect the&#13;
general points made in the text.&#13;
4/   The model demonstrates the existence of excess supply.     This, as discussed&#13;
below, does not necessarily correspond to rates of measured unemployment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
if the cut-off level is set equal to the free market wage of W, the number&#13;
underemployed is M. 1/ Thus, whereas the labor market distortion is a nec-&#13;
essary and sufficient condition for the existence of excess supply and&#13;
intersectoral differences in labor's marginal product, it is a necessary,&#13;
but not sufficient, condition for the existence of underemployment. 2/&#13;
The analytical significance of excess supply is apparent from&#13;
the above; it indicates the existence of a distortion in the labor market,&#13;
the removal of which would, subject to certain qualifications, improve the&#13;
allocation of resources. Exactly the same point applies to the presence&#13;
of intersectoral differentials in marginal productivity. It is possible,&#13;
therefore, to establish the presence of a distortion without specifying&#13;
a cut-off level for productivity and hence without being able to estimate&#13;
a rate of underemployment. The analytical and policy significance of under-&#13;
employment, therefore, remain obscure.&#13;
The concept of underemployment could be instilled with policy sig-&#13;
nificance in two other ways. First, it could be argued that because of a&#13;
distortion in another market (the capital market, for example) the earnings&#13;
of the self-employed are lower than they otherwise would be. The policy&#13;
deduction would then relate to improving the efficiency of the capital&#13;
market. Estimates of underemployment, however, do not attempt to identify&#13;
the cause of low earnings but simply estimate all those lying below a given&#13;
cut-off level whatever the underlying cause. This rationale, therefore, does&#13;
not stand scrutiny. The only alternative explanation is that estimates of&#13;
underemployment are required because the policy maker is concerned, not only&#13;
with economic efficiency, but also with income distribution; it is concluded&#13;
that estimates of underemployment only have significance in terms of income&#13;
distribution.&#13;
To determine the policy significance of estimates of unemployment,&#13;
it is necessary to establish the relationship between the analytical concept&#13;
of excess supply depicted in Figure 1 and the statistical measure of unemploy-&#13;
ment used in labor surveys and census data. Two points in particular warrant&#13;
discussion. The first concerns the limitation of the statistical measure of&#13;
the unemployed to those "actively seeking work." The second concerns the&#13;
significance of adjustment costs which were omitted by assumption from the&#13;
analysis based on Figure 1. These points are discussed below.&#13;
In defining employment for statistical purposes, most countries&#13;
follow the ILO recommendations: that is, the reference period is usually&#13;
1/   In the early literature on surplus labor in agriculture, for example,&#13;
zero marginal product was the chosen cut-off point. More generally,&#13;
the extent of underemployment can be increased or reduced by appro-&#13;
priate variations in the cut-off level.&#13;
2/   If labor heterogeneity is admitted, a labor market distortion is not&#13;
even a necessary condition for the existence of underemployment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
one week, part-time workers are generally included in the total of employed,&#13;
and the unemployed include those who did not work, or worked less than one&#13;
day, during the reference period and were actively seeking work. It is not&#13;
clear, however, that those denoted by U in Figure 1 would be actively seeking&#13;
employment given the assumption of perfect information. Although their supply&#13;
price is below the wage, they know that jobs are not available and would,&#13;
therefore, refrain from pointless job-search. The theoretical model thus&#13;
predicts a zero rate of unemployment defined in the statistical sense. It is&#13;
concluded that institutional constraints on wages imply a sectoral misalloca-&#13;
tion of labor resources but are not a sufficient condition for the existence&#13;
of unemployment.&#13;
Labor markets, however, do not adjust instantaneously. The theo-&#13;
retical analysis should be recast, therefore, in terms of the dynamics of&#13;
adjustment by treating time explicitly. Distortions now arise, not only&#13;
-from constraints on wage determination, but also from imperfect information,&#13;
uncertainty and other transaction costs; active job-search becomes a rational&#13;
exercise; and nonzero estimates of statistical unemployment can be expected.&#13;
The return to job-search, and hence the duration of search, will be an&#13;
increasing function of the dispersion of wage rates or degree of segmenta-&#13;
tion in the labor market. The duration of search will also depend on the&#13;
searcher's ability to finance a period of unemployment. This suggests that&#13;
rates of measured unemployment will be higher for those types of labor that&#13;
offer their services in segmented labor markets and that are in a position&#13;
to finance extended periods of job-search.&#13;
It also suggests that unsuccessful job-seekers will eventually&#13;
abandon active job-search. This has led to attempts to estimate the number&#13;
of "discouraged job-seekers" by relaxing the requirement of active job-search.&#13;
Surveys designed to distinguish between those actively searching for jobs and&#13;
those willing to accept jobs at going wage rates but not engaging in active&#13;
job-search suggest that the conventional approach fails to capture all those&#13;
unemployed in the excess-supply sense. Turnham (1971), for example, cites the&#13;
case of West Malaysia in 1967 where the unemployment rate was increased from&#13;
6.8 to 8.8 percent by the inclusion of discouraged workers. In a careful&#13;
study of the Tanzanian urban labor market in 1971, Sabot (1977) shows that&#13;
inclusion of discouraged workers increases the rate of urban unemployment&#13;
from 8.0 to 12.0 percent. A similar study in the Sudan, however, produced&#13;
corresponding estimates of 5.3 and 5.9 percent (Mulat, 1975). Clearly, the&#13;
impact of the discouraged worker phenomenon varies considerably. Neverthe-&#13;
less, in interpreting the open unemployment rates presented below, the&#13;
presumption should be that they are minimum estimates.&#13;
Adjustment costs also play a role on the demand side. Segmentation&#13;
can occur not only as a result of institutional factors, such as minimum wage&#13;
legislation, but also because the return to wage rate adjustments varies among&#13;
enterprises. It may, for example, be administratively more costly to change&#13;
wage rates in a large firm than in a small one. Similarly, a small firm may&#13;
have more direct access to labor market information than a large one. Either&#13;
way, positive rates of unemployment can be expected even if the market is&#13;
free of institutional constraints.&#13;
&#13;

This rather lengthy discussion is justified by the considerable&#13;
debate on these issues in the literature. To place the above discussion&#13;
in perspective, one may identify two broad schools of thought. On the one&#13;
hand, a number of authors argue that "a somewhat more hopeful approach in&#13;
the long term to measuring the size of the employment problem and degree&#13;
of progress towards its solution is, we believe, offered by an emphasis&#13;
on poverty" (Turnham, 1971 p. 18-19) and that the openly unemployed are&#13;
only "the tip of the iceberg" (Edwards, 1974, p. 13). The emphasis here,&#13;
then is clearly on underemployment. This approach has received its most&#13;
enthusiastic support in the series of country reports prepared by the ILO,&#13;
where the extent of underemployment as measured by an income criterion'&#13;
became an important part of the totality of the employment problem. 1/&#13;
On the other hand, it has been argued that it is important to maintain&#13;
the analytic distinction between a poverty problem, which may indeed be&#13;
reflected in low labor earnings, and an unemployment problem which indicates&#13;
labor market imperfections. This view has been expressed by, among others,&#13;
Bruton (1973, p.4), Sen (1975, p.51), Sabot (1977, p.401) and Stewart (1975,&#13;
p.3) and is adopted in the subsequent discussion of estimates of the employ-&#13;
ment problem; that is, unemployment estimates are taken to be indications&#13;
of market imperfection and underemployment estimates are interpreted as&#13;
measures of poverty.&#13;
A further conclusion of importance for subsequent discussion&#13;
concerns the policy significance of intersectoral wage differentials and&#13;
unemployment. The above arguments suggest that intersectoral wage dif-&#13;
ferentials imply a corresponding intersectoral misallocation of labor&#13;
resources but are not a sufficient condition for the existence of unemploy-&#13;
ment. The benefit of eliminating wage differentials caused by such factors&#13;
as minimum wage legislation thus lies in the ensuing improvement in resource&#13;
allocation. To eliminate or reduce unemployment, however, it is necessary&#13;
to reduce the return to job-search. This, in turn, entails accelerating the&#13;
rate of labor market adjustment on the supply side by improving information&#13;
flows.&#13;
Estimates of Unemployment&#13;
The estimates of open unemployment reported in Table 17 range from&#13;
16.1 percent for Bolivia to 0.2 percent for Thailand. Sabolo (1975,b) esti-&#13;
mates unemployment in the developing countries as a group to be 7.4 percent&#13;
in 1970 compared to only 2.2 percent for the DCs in the same year. Africa&#13;
is shown to have the highest rate of open unemployment (9.6 percent), followed&#13;
by Asia (7.1 percent) and Latin America (5.1 percent).&#13;
Given the heterogeneity of the labor force, measures of total unem-&#13;
ployment are of limited use for identifying the labor markets most seriously&#13;
affected by imperfections. It is of considerable interest, therefore, to&#13;
1/   See, for example, ILO (1970) p. 15, ILO (1972) p. 1, ILO (1974) p. 7&#13;

investigate the characteristics of the unemployed in more detail. Tables 18,&#13;
19 and 20 demonstrate that unemployment is more serious in urban than in rural&#13;
areas and that within urban areas it is more serious for those aged 15 to 24&#13;
than for the total labor force, for females than for males and, at least up to&#13;
post-secondary education, for the more educated than for the less educated.&#13;
For 6 of the 14 countries listed in Table 18 the rate of urban&#13;
unemployment is at least twice that of rural unemployment. Moreover, with&#13;
the notable exceptions of Iran and Sri Lanka, the rates of rural unemployment&#13;
are not especially high. Focussing exclusively on urban unemployment, Table 19&#13;
reveals that in 7 of the 12 listed countries the unemployment rate for males&#13;
in the age group 15 to 24 is more than twice that of the total male labor&#13;
force. 1/ For females the difference is less marked, only 3 of the countries&#13;
~having unemployment rates for the 15 to 24 age group twice that of the total&#13;
female labor force. Table 19 also allows a comparison of male and female&#13;
unemployment rates. In 9 of the countries the rate of female unemployment&#13;
exceeds that for males. In this comparison, however, it should be recalled&#13;
that female participation rates are much lower than those for men.&#13;
Finally, Table 20 shows the relationship between unemployment and&#13;
educational attainment. In general, unemployment rates are lower for the&#13;
illiterate and those with post-secondary education than for those with primary&#13;
or secondary education, the secondary school leaver often facing the most&#13;
severe unemployment problem. 2/ There are, however, notable exceptions to&#13;
this generalization. In Kenya, for example, the illiterate experience the&#13;
highest rate of unemployment while in Sri Lanka the rate for primary school&#13;
leavers is relatively low.&#13;
The data on unemployment rates examined above clearly point to the&#13;
failure of the market for certain types of labor. The combination of high&#13;
returns to job-search and the ability to finance unemployment is most evident&#13;
in the market for young, inexperienced but educated workers in urban areas.&#13;
Part II will examine the operation of this market in some detail.&#13;
Estimates of Underemployment&#13;
Estimates of underemployment may be divided into two distinct&#13;
types: the first, visible underemployment, is defined to include those who&#13;
are employed but would like to work longer hours; and the second, invisible&#13;
underemployment is defined in a number of ways, but generally includes those&#13;
whose earnings lie below a given cut-off level. The two concepts are&#13;
1/   The age distribution of unemployment in the USA is similar.     In 1977,&#13;
the 16-24 age group experienced an unemployment rate of 13.6 percent&#13;
compared with 7.0 percent for the total labor force (USA, 1978).&#13;
2/   In part, this may reflect differences in age distribution, that of the&#13;
educated being skewed in favor of the young compared with that of the&#13;
illiterate. Age-specific unemployment rates may show higher rates for&#13;
the illiterate in the older age groups.&#13;

analytically very different. Visible underemployment is closely related to&#13;
open undermployment because it is caused by, and reflects, labor market imper-&#13;
fections. As argued earlier, however, invisible underemployment only has&#13;
significance as a measure of poverty.&#13;
With regard to the estimates of visible underemployment shown in&#13;
Table 21, two points are worthy of note. First, in Tanzania and Colombia&#13;
the percentage of the labor force categorized as visibly underemployed is&#13;
surprisingly small. Second, even in the case of Chile it is not clear to&#13;
what extent the removal of underemployment would expand labor utilization&#13;
because information is lacking on the amount of additional labor that would&#13;
be forthcoming from the currently underemployed. Turnham concludes that&#13;
"where attempts have been made to convert extra work demanded into an equiva-&#13;
lent percentage of full time unemployed, the addition is usually rather&#13;
meagre - 2 or 3 percent - although the proportion of the employed force&#13;
wanting some additional work may be quite high" (Turnham, 1971, p. 59).&#13;
Nevertheless, visible underemployment constitutes a further reason for&#13;
treating reported rates of open unemployment as minimum estimates.&#13;
The second part of Table 21 presents a number of estimates of&#13;
invisible underemployment which range from 60 percent in the Dominican Republic&#13;
to 14 percent in the Philippines. Care has been taken to describe the cut-off&#13;
point of earnings as fully as possible. In many cases the official minimum&#13;
wage has been used. In these cases the estimates convey certain information.&#13;
In other cases, the information conveyed, if any, is far from clear. The&#13;
example of the Philippines may be worth discussing in more detail. The pro-&#13;
cedure for arriving at the estimate of underemployment is described in a&#13;
footnote as follows: "Our rough estimate of total unemployment is based on&#13;
an inadequate income concept using the gap between average wages in the&#13;
organized and unorganized urban sectors, the share of the urban labor force&#13;
in each sector, plus open unemployment. For the urban labor force in 1971,&#13;
excluding professional and civil service categories, 70 percent of the labor&#13;
force was employed in the unorganized sector, earning some 68 percent of the&#13;
organized sector wage, and 11 percent was openly unemployed. If the wage&#13;
gap were an accurate indication of the degree of underemployment in the&#13;
unorganized sector, total unemployment could be estimated as 33 percent,&#13;
that is [(1.0 - 0.68) x 70] plus 11 percent." (ILO, 1974, p. 7). 1/ Under-&#13;
employment in this case, therefore, is dependent on the sectoral earnings&#13;
differential, and is not simply an estimate of the number below some cut-off&#13;
level. Moreover, its addition to the open unemployment rate to produce a&#13;
measure of the "total unemployment" problem seems especially indefensible&#13;
because the two components bear no obvious relationship; open unemployment is&#13;
denominated in numbers of the labor force whereas underemployment in this case&#13;
is measured in units of output.&#13;
1/   The figure of 14 percent for invisible underemployment reported in&#13;
Table 21 is arrived at by means of this method but uses a different&#13;
measure of the sectoral earnings differential.&#13;

Equally indefensible are the regional estimates of invisible under-&#13;
employment for Africa, Asia and Latin America. Such estimates involve the&#13;
aggregation of individual country estimates (including, as it happens, that&#13;
for the Philippines) each of which is based on a different approach, or, if&#13;
the approach is the same, a different cut-off level of earnings. Interna-&#13;
tional aggregation of such a disparate set of country-specific estimates of&#13;
underemployment can only produce meaningless a total.&#13;
The above discussion and critique of estimates of underemployment&#13;
has been included to illustrate some of the confusion that surrounds the&#13;
underlying concepts. Provided the minimum cut-off level of earnings is&#13;
clearly specified, estimates of invisible underemployment convey information&#13;
in precisely the same way as estimates of the numbers below some poverty&#13;
threshold. Such estimates, however, should not be combined with the recorded&#13;
rate of open unemployment to arrive at a measure of the total unemployment&#13;
problem, nor should they be aggregated internationally to arrive at regional&#13;
or global measures of underemployment.&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
Underemployment, defined in terms of low earnings, is a manifestation&#13;
of the excessive growth of the labor force relative to complementary factors&#13;
of production. If labor markets are reasonably well-integrated the solution&#13;
to this problem must be sought in factors affecting labor demand and supply.&#13;
An important premise of this argument is that unskilled labor markets work&#13;
reasonably well. To establish this proposition, the role of various forms&#13;
of labor market distortions -- minimum wage legislation, trade union activity,&#13;
and social security provisions -- are examined and their impact on resource&#13;
allocation is assessed.&#13;
The solution of the unemployment problem, however, is found in the&#13;
operation of particular labor markets. Here the emphasis is on improving&#13;
information flows to accelerate adjustment in the labor market. Exogenous&#13;
shifts in labor supply and demand are also important in this respect because&#13;
their magnitude and speed determine the degree of required adjustment. The&#13;
recent rapid growth of population and the sudden increase in enrollment rates&#13;
represent major changes in labor supply conditions which can be expected to&#13;
have exerted exceptional pressure on labor markets.&#13;
In the subsequent sections, some of these issues are discussed in&#13;
more detail. Part II is devoted to an analysis of labor markets and is con-&#13;
cerned primarily with the problems of unemployment and the misallocation&#13;
of resources. In Parts III and IV various factors operating on the labor&#13;
demand and supply curves are discussed. These sections, therefore, are&#13;
addressed to problems arising from the relatively slow rate of transforma-&#13;
tion in the industrial structure of the labor force, and to the concern&#13;
with underemployment.&#13;

PART II: THE OPERATION OF LABOR MARKETS IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT&#13;
In this Part, the operation of labor markets is examined with&#13;
the objective of identifying the quantitative significance of labor market&#13;
distortions. It is argued that unskilled labor markets are reasonably&#13;
efficient: rural wages rates are determined by supply and demand although&#13;
not necessarily in a competitive framework; high rates of rural-urban migra-&#13;
tion attest to the mobility of the labor force; and urban wage rates are less&#13;
influenced by institutional factors than is commonly thought.    Nevertheless,&#13;
labor legislation and trade union activity have undoubtedly influenced wages&#13;
marginally in some countries and significantly in a few countries. The&#13;
removal of these distortions, however, is unlikely to raise the return to&#13;
labor in the informal sector to any significant extent.    Although the removal&#13;
of distortions is to be encouraged on short-run efficiency and dynamic&#13;
grounds, it is argued here that increases in informal incomes must be sought&#13;
in measures other than the elimination of labor market distortions.&#13;
Low rates of unemployment for unskilled labor contrast sharply&#13;
with the high rates experienced by young, educated workers.     The return&#13;
to job-search and the ability to finance unemployment are apparently con-&#13;
centrated in this group. As noted in Part I, the rapid growth in population&#13;
and the simultaneous desire to increase enrollment rates have caused a major&#13;
expansion in the supply of young, educated workers. The consequent failure&#13;
of the market to adjust adequately is attributed, in part, to the inflexibility&#13;
of pay scales, especially in the public sector, and, in part to the slow rate&#13;
of downward revision in job expectations which may in turn be attributed to&#13;
inadequate information flows.&#13;
The section is organized as follows. Simple models of the dual&#13;
economy are analyzed first and some of their deficiencies are identified for&#13;
subsequent discussion. Rural labor utilization and the determination of&#13;
rural wages are then examined. This is followed by a discussion of rural-&#13;
urban migration which focusses in particular on the characteristics of&#13;
migrants and the determinants and consequences of migration. The bulk of&#13;
Part II, however, is concerned with the operation of urban labor markets&#13;
both for unskilled and educated labor.&#13;

Chapter 4: Models of the Dual Labor Market-&#13;
A dual labor market, in which the wage rate in one sector of&#13;
the economy exceeds the marginal product of labor in another, has been&#13;
a prominent feature in models of the structural transformation of the labor&#13;
force during the process of economic development. There have been two main&#13;
variants of the model which may be termed 'traditional sector dualism' and&#13;
'modern sector dualism'. In the former, dualism occurs because the supply&#13;
price of labor from the traditional sector exceeds its marginal product in&#13;
agriculture. In the latter, the source of dualism is an institutionally-&#13;
determined industrial wage which exceeds labor's supply price.&#13;
The supply price of labor in traditional sector dualism is usually&#13;
determined by the average product of labor in incoming-sharing rural house-&#13;
holds (Lewis, 1954) or by subsistence wage payments established by landlords&#13;
(Fei and Ranis, 1961). Either way, it is assumed that labor's supply price&#13;
exceeds its marginal product which, in turn, is often viewed as equal to zero&#13;
in the early stages of development because of an excessively large labor&#13;
force relative to complementary factors of production. 2/ Because the indus-&#13;
trial wage was determined by labor's supply price, the transfer of labor from&#13;
agriculture to industry was thought to improve resource allocation (the indus-&#13;
trial wage being greater than labor's foregone marginal product) but was not&#13;
seen as a possible cause of excess supply of labor to urban areas (the indus-&#13;
trial wage being equal to labor's supply price).&#13;
The emergence of high rates of urban unemployment, however, was&#13;
thought to cast considerable doubt on the empirical plausibility of a theory&#13;
based on market-clearing wages. Accordingly, unemployment was made the focal&#13;
point of modern sector dualism by assuming that equilibrium in the labor market&#13;
was secured by a quantity adjustment -- a change in the rate of unemployment --&#13;
rather than a price adjustment. 3/ The exact mechanism precluding wage rate&#13;
adjustment was often not specified, but reference was usually made to public&#13;
legislation, trade unions or the hiring practices of modern sector firms.&#13;
Equilibrium in this situation is characterized by equality between labor's&#13;
supply price from the traditional sector with the expected industrial wage&#13;
rate, this latter being assumed equal to the product of the actual wage rate&#13;
and the probability of employment (Harris and Todaro, 1970). Because the&#13;
1/   This chapter draws on Bertrand and Squire (1979).&#13;
2/   The conditions for a zero marginal product of labor on family farms&#13;
have since been shown to be implausible (Sen, 1966). The argument&#13;
in the text, however, only requires that labor's marginal product&#13;
be less than its supply price and not that it be zero.&#13;
3/   As argued in Chapter 3, in a world of perfect certainty measured unem-&#13;
ployment would be-zero even if excess labor supply were positive. Unless&#13;
theories of modern sector dualism explicitly incorporate uncertainty,&#13;
and hence a rationale for job-search, they cannot explain unemployment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
probability of employment was assumed to be a function of the rate of unem-&#13;
ployment, the latter, rather than the (fixed) wage rate, became the equili-&#13;
briating mechanism in the labor market.&#13;
Modern sector dualism, as described above, is clearly far too&#13;
simple to reflect the complexity of the real world. The approach can, however,&#13;
be extended in a number of directions. First a theory of wage rate determina-&#13;
tion, or a demonstration that the industrial wage is indeed determined by,&#13;
for example, minimum wage legislation, is an essential component of analysis&#13;
based on modern sector dualism. This subject receives considerable attention&#13;
below.&#13;
Second, a two-sector model is too limited to capture the multi-&#13;
faceted dimensions of labor market transactions in LDCs. Models have been&#13;
developed, therefore, which incorporate the basic assumption of modern sector&#13;
dualism but which expanded the analysis to three or more sectors. 1/ Of major&#13;
importance has been the emergence of the urban informal sector. Originally&#13;
introduced by Hart (1973), the informal sector has suffered as an analytic&#13;
concept from a confusing variety of definitions. Hart had in mind the distinc-&#13;
tion between wage and self employment as the essential difference between the&#13;
formal and informal sectors (Hart, 1973). This is also the definition advo-&#13;
cated by Mazumdar (1977) although he suggests the inclusion in the informal&#13;
sector of wage employees in small establishments. ILO (1972) identifies the&#13;
informal sector by reference to a variety of characteristics such as the small&#13;
scale of operation, reliance on indigenous resources and family ownership of&#13;
enterprises. For empirical exercises it may well be necessary to adopt&#13;
such approaches, but it is, nevertheless, important to have in the background&#13;
a precise analytical distinction between formal and informal. In the context&#13;
of this exercise it seems appropriate to define the informal sector as that&#13;
sector in which the return to labor, whether or not it be in the form of&#13;
wages, is determined by the forces of supply and demand. The advantage of&#13;
this approach is that the informal sector is not determined by some physical&#13;
characteristic such as establishment size but by means of an analytical&#13;
significant characteristic.&#13;
The third area in which expansion of the model is essential is&#13;
the assumption that labor is a homogeneous factor of production. Labor&#13;
heterogeneity has not received sufficient attention in formal modelling 2/&#13;
but is well documented in the descriptive literature. 3/ The implications&#13;
of heterogeneity are devastating.    For example, the dualism models described&#13;
so far purport to explain unemployment and wage differentials for labor of&#13;
homogeneous quality by reference to the existence of segmented labor markets.&#13;
If, however, labor is heterogeneous, unemployment can be explained without&#13;
reference to segmented labor markets; unemployment can exist for some types&#13;
1/   See, for example, Mazumdar (1977), Sabot (1977), Harberger (1971),&#13;
Collier (1975), and Scoville (1977).&#13;
2/   Exceptions are Fields (1974) and Pinera and Selowsky (1978).&#13;
3/   See, for example, the essays in Kannappan (1977, a).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
of labor (for example, educated workers) and not for others (for example,&#13;
unskilled workers). This is a particular illustration of the general point&#13;
that the recognition of labor heterogeneity makes it very difficult to&#13;
interpret earnings differentials. On the one hand, they could reflect&#13;
quality differentials; on the other hand, they could indicate a distortion.&#13;
As a result, pronouncements on the operation of particular labor markets&#13;
must be treated with some caution and should be recognized as the judgments&#13;
of (presumably) well-informed observers.&#13;
The final area where additional effort may prove beneficial is&#13;
the assumption concerning the behavior of the unemployed. In the case of&#13;
homogeneous labor, the unemployed are assumed to make their decision to&#13;
accept the reality of unemployment now because of the future prospect of&#13;
eventual employment in the high-wage sector. All the information required&#13;
for this decision is known with absolute certainty. Abandoning the assump-&#13;
tions of perfect foresight and labor homogeneity alters the picture substan-&#13;
tially: the manner in which the unemployed adjust to changing labor market&#13;
conditions, and to any divergence between expectations and reality, now&#13;
becomes a legitimate area for investigation. The skill-occupation or&#13;
education-occupation mix thus emerges as an alternative, or additional,&#13;
market-equilibriating mechanism to the unemployment rate in situations&#13;
where the structure of wages is thought to be fixed institutionally. Most&#13;
of the issues addressed above in general terms (wage determination, labor&#13;
heterogeneity, and the adjustment process) will be discussed further in&#13;
this Part. The discussion of the informal sector, however, is deferred&#13;
to Part III.&#13;

Chapter 5: Determination of Rural Wages&#13;
Rural Labor Utilization&#13;
Low overall rates of labor utilization, marked seasonal variation&#13;
in labor use and low rates of labor market participation are frequent charac-&#13;
terizations of the rural employment situation in LDCs. The available data,&#13;
however, do not always support this view. Tables 22, 24 and 26 present a&#13;
variety of international statistics on rural labor utilization, while tables&#13;
23, 25 and 27 provide more detail for particular regions or countries. Table&#13;
22 reveals that the majority of the rural labor force work more than 40 hours.&#13;
In Taiwan, for example, over 95% of the male labor force work more than 42&#13;
hours. At the other extreme, less than 30% of the female labor force work&#13;
more than 40 hours in the Philippines. Nevertheless, the overall impression&#13;
from Table 22 is not that of a highly underutilized labor force. Moreover,&#13;
aggregative statistics of this sort often fail to capture a number of activi-&#13;
ties which may not be directly productive (such as travel to and from fields)&#13;
but are still time consuming.&#13;
Time-budget studies, that is, detailed investigations of the allo-&#13;
cation of time to all activities, avoid some of the problems associated with&#13;
census and survey data but are generally based on very small samples. Three&#13;
such studies for Africa are reported in Table 23. Men devote between 30&#13;
(Cameroon) and 50 percent (Uganda) of a 12-hour day to social activities or&#13;
rest. The corresponding range for women is 20 (Ivory Coast) to 45 percent&#13;
(Cameroon). Clearly, there is considerable variation both among samples&#13;
and between sexes within samples.&#13;

This discussion also bears on the issue of surplus labor. 1/ In&#13;
this respect, it is important to remember that, even if low rates of labor&#13;
utilization are observed, it does not necessarily follow that the labor market&#13;
is imperfect or that labor is in surplus; the returns to labor may simply be&#13;
too low to make work an attractive proposition. What is required is an esti-&#13;
mate of the number of workers seeking additional work and of the amount of&#13;
work they are prepared to undertake at the market wage.     Such information is&#13;
rarely available. 2/ A survey in the rural areas of the Philippines in 1965,&#13;
for example, revealed that 71.6 percent of men and 74.7 percent of women did&#13;
not want additional work (Turnham, 1971). It did not, however, provide infor-&#13;
mation on the quantity of additional work sought by the remaining men and&#13;
women. In the absence of such information, estimates of surplus labor arrived&#13;
at by substracting actual work time from some arbitrary norm must be considered&#13;
of doubtful value.&#13;
Apart from labor utilization, the extent of labor market participa-&#13;
tion is often not realized. Table 24 provides some indication of the range&#13;
among countries. Latin American countries often have more than 30% of their&#13;
agricultural labor force in wage employment; whereas the corresponding figure&#13;
for most of the Asian and African countries shown in Table 24 is less than&#13;

force in agriculture and the share of wage employment in the agricultural&#13;
labor force suggests that the latter share may bear an inverse relationship&#13;
to the general level of development. Such a conclusion, however, would be&#13;

premature; the observed differences in the share of wage employment could&#13;
also be explained by reference to the degree of inequality in land holdings.&#13;
In support of this view, the Latin American countries which typically have&#13;
very unequal land distributions are also seen to have the highest share of&#13;
wage employment. Moreover, Japan, the most developed country shown in&#13;
Table 24 has only 4.9 percent of its agricultural labor force in wage&#13;
employment.&#13;
Of course, agricultural wage employment is only one aspect of the&#13;
extent to which rural households participate in the labor market; they also&#13;
supply labor to nonagricultural activities. Table 25 provides information on&#13;
total labor market participation (that is, the extent of hiring in and hiring&#13;
out) for agricultural households in Malaysia and Egypt disaggregated by farm&#13;
size and family size. As constructed here, the Table reveals a marked inverse&#13;
relationship between hiring in and hiring out. Large families with small&#13;
farms hire in a small proportion of their total labor input, but hire out a&#13;
large proportion of their total labor supply. At the other extreme, small&#13;
families with large farms hire a large proportion of their total labor input,&#13;
but offer very little of their own labor on the market.&#13;
While the above point is perhaps obvious, it has important impli-&#13;
cations. In particular, it suggests that the common distinction in the theo-&#13;
retical literature between households which take labor supply and other&#13;
decisions without reference to the market wage (subsistence or utility-&#13;
maximizing households) and those whose labor supply and demand decisions&#13;
are dependent on the market wage (large or profit-maximizing farms) may not&#13;
be substantiated empirically. If the large majority of agricultural house-&#13;
holds, regardless of farm and family size, participate in the labor market&#13;
either as buyers or sellers the subsistence model would seem to be a mis-&#13;
leading representation of reality; labor market participation should be an&#13;
important component of models of agricultural households. 1/ A more meaning-&#13;
ful way of categorizing households would then be whether a household is a&#13;
net "importer" or "exporter" of labor; changes in the market wage can be&#13;
expected to have different implications for households categorized in this&#13;
manner.&#13;
A further dimension of the diversity of labor market opportunities&#13;
is demonstrated in Table 26, which shows the division of the rural labor&#13;
force between agriculture and other activities. In eight of the fourteen&#13;
countries shown in Table 26 nonagricultural activities provide the primary&#13;
source of employment for more than 25 percent of the rural labor force.&#13;
High elasticities of demand for nonfarm goods and services suggest that, as&#13;
rural incomes increase, nonfarm employment in such activities as construction,&#13;
commerce, service, transport, processing and manufacturing will increase more&#13;
than proportionately. 2/&#13;
1/   Models of this type are described and estimated in Yotopoulos and Lau&#13;
(1974), Lin, Lau and Yotopoulos (1978) and Barnum and Squire (forth-&#13;
coming).&#13;

The existence of opportunities for nonfarm employment suggest&#13;
the possibility that, although labor input into agriculture may be highly&#13;
seasonal, total employment, on-farm and off-farm, may be less so. For the&#13;
three countries shown in Table 27 the effect of seasonality is much more&#13;
pronounced when only on-farm family labor use is considered then when off-&#13;
farm activities are allowed for. The case of Malaysia is particularly&#13;
interesting because information is also available on total (that is, family&#13;
and hired) labor input into agriculture. Thus, the coefficient of variation&#13;
for total farm labor input is 0.50 indicating considerable seasonal fluctua-&#13;
tion. As shown in Table 27, however, the coefficient falls to 0.35 for&#13;
family input to on-farm activities and to 0.20 for total family labor use.&#13;
Malaysian agricultural households, therefore, are able to offset the season-&#13;
ality inherent in agricultural production both by hiring in labor to lessen&#13;
the burden of peak-period labor demands and by hiring out labor during the&#13;
slacker periods of the agricultural cycle (Goldman and Squire, 1978).     A&#13;
diversified econmy and an active labor market have, at least in this case,&#13;
served to minimize the impact of the natural agricultural production cycle&#13;
on the seasonality of employment.&#13;

Despite the above, seasonality remains a feature of most&#13;
agricutural regions. Of itself, however, a seasonal pattern of labor&#13;
use does not necessarily imply market failure. More labor is utilized&#13;
in the busy season precisely because the return to labor use is high;&#13;
and vice versa in the slack season. The operation of rural labor markets&#13;
is discussed subsequently, but two points which bear directly on the issue&#13;
of seasonality are introduced here. First, in a detailed study of Egyptian&#13;
agriculture and rural employment, Hansen demonstrates a remarkably close&#13;
correspondence between monthly movements in labor use and rural wages (Hansen,&#13;
1969, Figures 1, 2 and 3). While not conclusive, the evidence clearly sug-&#13;
gests that variations in the wage rate are consistent with the efficient&#13;
operation of the labor market. And second, analysis of aggregate employment&#13;
data for Thailand demonstrates that the marked seasonal variations in employ-&#13;
ment reflect excessively long work hours during the peak season (over a&#13;
quarter of the labor force averaged more than seventy hours a week in the&#13;
rainy season) and the extensive participation of women and youngsters in the&#13;
rainy season work force (Bertrand and Squire, 1979). Such behavior is con-&#13;
sistent with the view that labor responds positively to the prospect of high&#13;
returns and does not, of itself, provide evidence of market failure.&#13;

Rural Wage Rate Determination&#13;
Wage rates in rural areas are usually thought to be determined&#13;
either by subsistence or nutritional requirements or else by the forces&#13;
of supply and demand, the latter encompassing not only competitive, but&#13;
also monopsonistic and dualistic explanations. It is argued here that the&#13;
available evidence is more consistent with the supply-and-demand explana-&#13;
tions of wage determination than with the subsistence explanations, and&#13;
that within the supply-and-demand explanations, there is evidence to support&#13;
both the competitive and monopsonistic versions, but the evidence for the&#13;
dualistic version is weak.&#13;
The first class of theories rests on a biological determination&#13;
of wage rates. Lewis, for example, assumed that, because labor supplies&#13;
were excessive relative to complementary factors, wages would be held down&#13;
to a subsistence level (Lewis, 1954). The further assumption that labor&#13;
supply would be perfectly elastic led to the strong prediction of constancy&#13;
in real wages over some not insignificant range regardless of changes in&#13;
demand. This prediction has not been fulfilled. Wages may well be low in&#13;
rural areas but they are generally observed to vary both over time and space.&#13;
Moreover, in a number of cases where rural wages have been the subject of&#13;
intensive study, the observed variations have been attributed, at least in&#13;
part, to supply and demand factors. 1/&#13;
A variant of the subsistence hypothesis focusses on the relation-&#13;
ship between nutrition and worker efficiency. A positive relationship&#13;
1/   See Hansen (1966) for the case of Egypt, Goldman and Squire (1978)&#13;
for Malaysia, Bardhan, P. (1977) for evidence on India, ILO (1976,a)&#13;
for the Sudan and Byerlee and Eicher (1972) for a more general dis-&#13;
cussion of the African situation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

between wages and the efficiency of labor may make it profitable for employers&#13;
to pay labor more than the subsistence wage. This theory leads to a number&#13;
of predictions about the wage payment system which can be confronted with&#13;
reality. Rodgers (1975) argues that labor-tying, an inverse relationship&#13;
between wages and the earner-dependent ratio, and payment in the form of&#13;
meals for the worker, are predicted by the nutritional theory. In each,&#13;
the motivating force is the desire of the employer to capture the efficiency&#13;
benefits of the greater nutritional content of higher wages.&#13;
Bardhan, K. (1977) offers a detailed critique of the nutritional&#13;
theory in the Indian context. Her basic points are that the above predic-&#13;
tions are not exclusive to the nutritional theory and that the required&#13;
assumptions, oligopsony and the absence of nonagricultural employment oppor-&#13;
tunities, may not be valid in any general sense. The evidence for a thorough&#13;
testing of the nutritional hypothesis is not yet available. It thus remains&#13;
possible that employers do attempt to influence wages in a manner consistent&#13;
with the theory but this possibility presumably diminishes as income rises&#13;
and the nutritional status of the labor force improves.&#13;
Turning to the supply-and-demand theories of wage determination,&#13;
the dualism explanation asserts that the supply price of family labor to off-&#13;
farm work lies above that for work on the family farm. 1/ As a result, the&#13;
marginal product of labor on family farms will lie below that on commercial,&#13;
labor-hiring farms. One obvious test of the theory, therefore, is to compare&#13;
the marginal product of labor on family and commercial farms. Using data for&#13;
India, Desai and Mazumdar (1970) demonstrate that the marginal product of&#13;
labor on farms hiring labor is significantly positive but that on farms not&#13;
hiring labor it is not significantly different from zero. This apparently&#13;
convincing demonstration of dualism must, however, be interpreted with some&#13;
caution. The evidence in fact reveals not a difference in behavior but a&#13;
difference in technology. The marginal product on family farms is zero, not&#13;
because labor is used to the point where its contribution to output becomes&#13;
insignificant, but because, according to the production function estimate,&#13;
labor does not contribute to output at any level of production. 2/ Apart&#13;
from technical criticisms, the evidence on extensive, and probably increasing,&#13;
labor market participation reduces the significance of the dualism theory.&#13;
The same evidence also points to the likelihood of reasonably&#13;
competitive labor markets. Cross-sectional [e.g., Bardhan, P. (1977)] and&#13;
time-series [e.g., Hansen (1966)] regression analyses have been used to indi-&#13;
cate the importance of supply factors (e.g., the nonagricultural wage, the&#13;
proportion of workers dependent on wage employment) and demand factors (e.g.,&#13;
1/   See, for example, Mazumdar (1965) and Mabro (1971).     This theory has&#13;
also been used to explain the higher labor intensity observed on small&#13;
(family) farms compared with large (commercial) farms.&#13;
2/   That is, the coefficient on the labor variable was not significantly&#13;
different from zero. The study by Brown and Salkin (1974) which treats&#13;
family and hired labor on Vietnamese farms as separate inputs is open&#13;
to the same criticism.&#13;

cropping intensity, area irrigated) in explaining the variance in the wage&#13;
rate.  Of particular interest is the study of interdistrict wage differentials&#13;
in India undertaken by Rosenzweig (1977). He concudes: "The econometric&#13;
results also tend to support the hypothesis that the Indian rural labor market&#13;
is competitive, suggesting that inter-district wage differences can be attri-&#13;
buted to geographical differences in the relative positions of market labor&#13;
supply and demand curves. The results also suggest, however, the existence&#13;
of monopsonistic wage and employment attenuation in areas characterized by a&#13;
high degree of land-holding inequality" (Rosenzweig, 1977, p. 39).&#13;
The empirical evidence on rural wage rate determination is scant,&#13;
but that which does exist is not inconsistent with Rosenzweig's conclusion.&#13;
In Malaysia, for example, where land distribution is relatively egalitarian,&#13;
Goldman and Squire (1978) argue that the market for agricultural labor&#13;
approximates the competitive model.    In India, on the other hand, where land&#13;
distribution is more unequal, Bardhan, P. (1977) arrives at a conclusion&#13;
similar to Rosenzweig's. Studies of wage determination in the Latin American&#13;
countries characterized by extreme inequality of land distribution would be of&#13;
great value in this context but are, unfortunately, lacking.             I&#13;
Apart from a few detailed case studies, those seeking an under-&#13;
standing of rural labor markets must rely on the more aggregate data examined&#13;
earlier.  In this regard, given the evidence on high rates of labor market&#13;
participation, low rates of open unemployment and (as shown below) high rates&#13;
of geographical and occupational mobility, the presumption should be that&#13;
rural labor markets are subject to the forces of supply and demand either in&#13;
a competitive or a monopsonistic setting.&#13;
This presumption, however, should not be interpreted to imply that&#13;
all is well in the rural sector.   The rural labor market may work reasonably&#13;
effectively yet the return to labor may be unacceptably low. This is undoubt-&#13;
edly the case in many LDCs.   The presumption, if substantiated, however, does&#13;
indicate that a solution to the problem of low returns to labor is not to be&#13;
found in the operation of the labor market; instead it is to be sought in the&#13;
distribution of land ownership, in the operation of capital markets, in the&#13;
pricing policy for agricultural output or in population or education policy.&#13;
In other words, attention should be focussed on the factors determining labor&#13;
demand and supply, rather than on the operation of the labor market itself.&#13;

Chapter 6: Rural-Urban Migration&#13;
Evidence on rural-urban migration is a primary means of demon-&#13;
strating the geographical mobility of labor. The large number of migration&#13;
studies, conducted in a variety of countries, consistently attest to a high&#13;
degree of labor mobility, which, moreover, is motivated in the main by&#13;
economic factors. The studies also reveal that migrants are concentrated&#13;
in particular subgroups of the population and, contrary to some popular&#13;
views, obtain employment at their point of destination relatively easily.&#13;
These issues, and their implications for the analysis of labor markets,&#13;
are discussed below.&#13;
Recent Trends in Rural-Urban Migration&#13;
The quantitative significance of rural-urban migration for the&#13;
growth of the urban population is well-documented. Table 28 provides an&#13;
overview of the recent historical experience in selected countries. The&#13;
data reveal two tendencies: first, with the exceptions of Nepal, Cambodia&#13;
and Peru, the percentage of urban population growth resulting from migration&#13;
declined between the 1950s and the 1960s; and second, again with exceptions,&#13;
such as India, the contribution of migration to urban growth declines with&#13;
GNP per capita. Neither of these tendencies is surprising because they both&#13;
reflect the increasing importance of urban relative to rural population. The&#13;
case of Brazil illustrates this point: in the 1960s only 37% of the growth&#13;
in the urban population was caused by migration, and yet this amounted to&#13;
over 8 million migrants, almost 4 million more than in any other country.&#13;
Migration in Brazil is small only when compared with its existing urban&#13;
population.&#13;
Theories of Rural-Urban Migration&#13;
Theoretical explanations of rural-urban migration have a long&#13;
history, dating from at least the 1880s when Ravenstein (1885 and 1889)&#13;
first propounded his laws of migration. The importance of the economic&#13;
motive, the negative influence of distance, and the role of step-migration&#13;
were some of the features of Ravenstein's approach which have survived most&#13;
attempts at reformulation. Sjaastad (1962), for example, couches his explan-&#13;
ation of the same phenomena in terms of human capital theory. He argues&#13;
that individuals behave as though migration is an investment in human capital.&#13;
His approach emphasizes complementary investments (for example, in training)&#13;
and provides a simple explanation (the shorter period over which to recoup&#13;
the costs of migration) of the universal tendency for migration rates to&#13;
decrease with age. The present status of the theory owes much to the recent&#13;
work of Harris and Todaro (1970). As noted above, they focus on the simul-&#13;
taneous occurence of sectoral wage differentials, urban unemployment and&#13;
rural-urban migration.&#13;

The Evidence&#13;
The various theories have stimulated considerable empirical&#13;
activity of both an econometric and descriptive character. A number of&#13;
recent surveys 1/ of the rapidly-expanding literature provide a fairly&#13;
clear view of the determinants and consequences of migration and of the&#13;
characteristics of the migrants, the main points of which are outlined&#13;
below.&#13;
Both field studies and econometric exercises point consistently&#13;
to the importance of the economic motive in the decision to migrate. The&#13;
field studies, for example, invariably report that migrants cite the&#13;
possibility of higher incomes or better jobs as the primary reason for&#13;
migration. And in the econometric exercises, income or wage differentials&#13;
usually emerge as the most important explanatory variables in the estimated&#13;
functions. Some studies, for example, Barnum and Sabot (1977), have also&#13;
demonstrated the importance of the expectation of employment as a separate&#13;
explanatory variable in the manner predicted by the Harris-Todaro theory.&#13;
In other studies, however, the probability of modern sector employment&#13;
has not proved significant (Huntington, 1974).&#13;
The other single most important factor in the migration decision&#13;
is distance. Migrants into large cities come primarily from neighboring&#13;
states and often from peripheral urban areas. Similarly, the econometric&#13;
estimates show that distance bears a highly significant, negative relation-&#13;
ship to migration. Apart from the costs of movement and information, both&#13;
of which can be expected to increase with distance, the possibility of&#13;
encountering superior income-earning alternatives also increases with the&#13;
distance between one's point of origin and potential destinations (Levy&#13;
and Wadycki, 1974).&#13;
The field studies have also demonstrated conclusively the marked&#13;
concentration of migrants within certain population subgroups. Migrants&#13;
are usually under thirty years of age, are better educated than non-migrants,&#13;
and can be male or female in Latin America but in Africa and South Asia are&#13;
usually male. The selectivity of the migration process carries with it&#13;
important implications for the econometric specification of both the migration-&#13;
response functions and the independent and dependent variables. Ideally,&#13;
functions should be estimated for subgroups of the population disaggregated&#13;
according to age, education and sex. Such detail, however, is rarely&#13;
attained. 2/ The more usual procedure when explaining interregional migra-&#13;
tion is to introduce on independent variable indicating the general level&#13;
of education in the region of origin.&#13;
1/   Carynnk-Sinclair (1974), Byerlee and Eicher (1972), Todaro (1976,a),&#13;
Brigg (1973), Yap (1977), and Connel et al (1976).&#13;

disaggregate by sex, age and education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

The specification of the variable designed to capture the earnings&#13;
differential encounters similar difficulties as soon as allowance is made for&#13;
differences either between migrants and non-migrants or within the migrant&#13;
group. The use of such variables as average rural-urban income differentials&#13;
or agricultural-industrial productivity differentials is obviously unsatis-&#13;
factory, both because they measure the return, not only to labor, but to all&#13;
factors of production, and because they fail to recognize the heterogeneity&#13;
of labor. Thailand provides an extreme illustration of this point. Rural&#13;
household incomes, for example, ranged from 30 percent of urban incomes in&#13;
the Northeast to 70 percent in Bangkok-Thonburi; average labor productivity&#13;
in agriculture in 1970 was only 12 percent of that in nonagriculture and&#13;
only 10 percent of that in manufacturing; and yet for a relatively homogeneous&#13;
category of unskilled labor (construction workers) wages paid in the North-&#13;
east were only 15 to 20 percent below those paid in the Central Plain&#13;
(Bertrand and Squire, 1979). This is not to deny the existence of large&#13;
geographical wage differentials in some countries but it does underline&#13;
the important point that, unless the return to labor is carefully specified,&#13;
geographical or sectoral comparisons can prove extremely misleading.&#13;
Table 29 presents data on intersectoral wage differentials for&#13;
low-skill labor. The differential between agriculture and manufacturing&#13;
exceeds 50 percent in eight out of the twenty-three cases, and that between&#13;
agriculture and construction exceeds 50 percent in six cases. These data,&#13;
however, probably raise more problems than they solve. For example, the&#13;
agricultural wage rates may be biassed in some cases by the inclusion of&#13;
high-paying plantations in the sample, and in other cases by the exclusion&#13;
of payment in kind. Similarly, the reported manufacturing wages do not&#13;
generally include wage supplements such as family allowances and medical&#13;
benefits, the omission of which is especially significant in Latin American&#13;
countries. Moreover, even though the focus is on low-skill labor, sectoral&#13;
differences in educational attainment, experience and labor force stability&#13;
can still constitute important sources of quality differentials. These&#13;
issues are discussed further in the subsequent analysis of urban labor&#13;
markets; it is noted here, however, that the ratio between urban unskilled&#13;
and agricultural wage rates in seven DCs in the second half of the 19th&#13;
century ranged from 1.2 in Japan to 2.0 in Australia with an unweighted&#13;
mean of 1.6. 1/ Thus, the historical experience of the DCs is not dissimilar&#13;
to the recent experience of the LDCs in this respect: either the data for&#13;
the DCs are very inaccurate, or large sectoral wage differentials for labor&#13;
of apparently homogeneous quality must be considered a not unusual feature&#13;
of industrialization.&#13;
The Harris-Todaro model of migration makes the migration decision&#13;
a function, not only of intersectoral wage differentials, but also of unem-&#13;
ployment rates. It is of some interest, therefore, to examine the employment&#13;
experience of recent migrants. The relevant data are reported in Table 30&#13;
1/   The countries and dates of observation are Australia, 1887; Denmark,&#13;
1872; France, 1892; Hungary, 1865; Japan, 1887; U.K., 1869; and&#13;
U.S.A., 1890. See Clark (1957), Table 11. Possible explanations of&#13;
such a large wage differential in the absence of obvious institutional&#13;
determination of wages are discussed in Chapter 7.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

and show that between 65 and 85 percent of migrants find work within one&#13;
month of migration. The probability of obtaining a job in a relatively&#13;
short period of time is apparently quite high, from which it may be inferred&#13;
that migrants are more risk averse than is usually recognized: many migrants&#13;
may in fact move only when they are assured of a job. Moreover, unemployment&#13;
rates are usually found to be lower for the migrant population than for the&#13;
resident population: migrants in Santiago, for example, experience a 4.0&#13;
percent unemployment rate compared with 6.5 percent for residents; similarly,&#13;
in Bombay the rates were 4.6 percent for migrants and 8.8 percent for resi-&#13;
dents. 1/ Some of these differences, however, may disappear if a control&#13;
were introduced for education.&#13;
The evidence indicates that migrants do not experience long periods&#13;
of unemployment and suggests that the overall urban unemployment rate may not&#13;
be the most appropriate measure of job prospects for migrants. Nevertheless,&#13;
if allowance is made for the heterogeneity of the labor force, skill-specific&#13;
rates of unemployment surely remain important determinants of migration either&#13;
because job offers become less frequent (hence reducing the flow of risk-&#13;
averse migrants) or because job prospects seem less attractive (hence reducing&#13;
the flow of those prepared to gamble).&#13;
The available evidence also suggests that migrants fare better&#13;
after they have moved, and, with the passage of time, enjoy similar employ-&#13;
ment and income opportunities to those experienced by the resident population. 2/&#13;
Surveys producing such conclusions, however, are usually conducted at the&#13;
point of destination and hence fail to capture the unsuccessful migrants who&#13;
have returned home or gone elsewhere. The few available case studies covering&#13;
this aspect of migration suggest that disappointed or unsuccessful migrants&#13;
constitute a relatively small proportion of total return migration. 3/ It is&#13;
reasonable to conclude, therefore, that the process of migration improves the&#13;
lot of the average migrant substantially.&#13;
Policy Implications&#13;
Labor mobility is an essential attribute of a well-functioning labor&#13;
market. The presumption is, therefore, that public policy should be concerned&#13;
with improving the geographical and occupational mobility of the labor force&#13;
by providing improved transport facilities and information flows. Instead,&#13;
the current rates of rural-urban migration are often considered excessive and&#13;
are thought to lead to situations of serious unemployment and underemployment&#13;
in urban areas, to increased drains on public revenue as authorities try to&#13;
1/   Reported in Yap (1977).   The results hold even when the data are disag-&#13;
gregated by age.&#13;
2/   Peek and Antolinez (1976), for example, demonstrate that urban natives&#13;
and migrants in San Salvador had similar incomes and employment levels.&#13;
They show further, however, that urban-urban migrants experienced higher&#13;
incomes and employment levels than rural-urban migrants.&#13;

maintain minimal levels of urban services for rapidly-expanding populations,&#13;
and to an increasingly depleted rural labor force as the more skilled, ener-&#13;
getic and better educated workers depart for the cities. Given the wide-&#13;
spread acceptance of these arguments and their potential significance for&#13;
policy formulation, they warrant special attention.&#13;

From the discussion in Part I, it is clear that migrants do not&#13;
create unemployment; unemployment owes its existence to labor market imper-&#13;
fections. If unemployment is a major concern, the appropriate policy response&#13;
is to improve the efficiency of the labor market. This approach is discussed&#13;
further in the subsequent analysis of urban labor markets.    It is unrealistic,&#13;
however, to imagine that all imperfections can or will be removed, in which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
case migration may indeed contribute to unemployment. 1/ Nevertheless, as&#13;
argued above the individual migrant probably benefits from migration. At&#13;
least in terms of the private costs and benefits, therefore, migration cannot&#13;
be considered excessive.&#13;
Social and private net benefits, however, may differ. This is&#13;
quite likely to happen if distortions in product markets cause different&#13;
divergences between social and private measures of labor's marginal produc-&#13;
tivity in urban and rural areas. For example, if agricultural export com-&#13;
modities are taxed (e.g., rice in Thailand) and industrial import-substitutes&#13;
are protected, the difference between rural and urban labor's marginal product&#13;
at market prices will not be an adequate approximation to the difference at&#13;
border prices. Similarly, if capital is misallocated between the urban and&#13;
rural sectors or within the rural sector, the demand for rural labor will be&#13;
less than would otherwise be the case. In this event, even if the social&#13;
marginal productivity, of labor is the same in the two sectors, the sectoral&#13;
distribution of labor will be biassed in favor of urban areas. In either of&#13;
these cases, however, the appropriate point for policy intervention is the&#13;
relevant product or nonlabor factor market and not the labor market. 3/&#13;
The second argument, concerning the cost of urban services, is&#13;
relevant only if migration necessarily results in increased public expendi-&#13;
ture and the social costs of the services exceed their social benefit.&#13;
Neither condition is especially plausible. An equally plausible view is&#13;
that high rates of migration prompt city managers to provide services which&#13;
have a net benefit to society. Provided urban services are subject to an&#13;
appropriate analysis of their social costs and benefits, there is no reason&#13;
to suppose that migration imposes an undesirable burden on urban public&#13;
finances. Even in this case, however, excess demand for public services can&#13;
occur if they are provided free of charge or at subsidized prices. This&#13;
introduces a distortion in the market for public services but not in the&#13;
labor market. If urban planners choose to satisfy the excess demand (that&#13;
is, if they fail to conduct an appropriate social evaluation), then migration&#13;
may be excessive. Here again, however, the required policy measure is the&#13;
introduction of an appropriate pricing policy for public services and not&#13;
intervention in the labor market.&#13;
1/   Some simple models demonstrate that the creation of one urban job will&#13;
induce enough migration to increase the numbers unemployed and maintain&#13;
the unemployment rate (Mazumdar, 1976). This is achieved, however, by&#13;
assuming that the geographical income differential is set exogeneously,&#13;
a most unlikely circumstance. Todaro (1976,b) argues that the rate of&#13;
unemployment may be increased by urban job creation. His simple empiri-&#13;
cal test, however, is criticized by Blomqvist (1978) on the grounds that&#13;
it relates to the short-run impact of small changes in the rate of job&#13;
creation on the rate of change in the rate of unemployment and that job&#13;
turnover is neglected.&#13;
2/   The internal terms of trade between agriculture and industry and the&#13;
operation of capital markets are examined in Part III.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
The argument concerning the depletion of the rural population is&#13;
more compelling but not totally convincing. If indeed the superior members&#13;
of the rural labor force migrate, then the difference between average rural&#13;
and urban incomes may increase. It is then sometimes argued that migration&#13;
has not fulfilled its expected role of reducing geographical income differ-&#13;
entials. This argument, of course, allows labor heterogeneity when describ-&#13;
ing the departure of "superior" labor but reverts to the assumption of labor&#13;
homogeneity when complaining about migration's failure to remove income&#13;
differentials. A reduction in income differentials for the particular type&#13;
of labor migrating is perfectly consistent with an increase in the differ-&#13;
ential between average incomes.&#13;
Nevertheless, the argument does raise important questions about&#13;
the spatial distribution of income.    The emergence of pockets of extreme&#13;
poverty is a distinct possibility if there is reason to believe that the&#13;
propensity, or ability, to migrate is unevenly distributed. Connell et al.&#13;
(1976), for example, argue that in India most village migration is not from&#13;
the very poorest households but from the relatively poor and the relatively&#13;
rich. 1/   This argument suggests the need for intervention on income distri-&#13;
bution grounds, but it does not necessarily follow that the most appropriate&#13;
mode of intervention is a ban or restriction on migration. In fact, increas-&#13;
ing the ability of the very poor to migrate may be the best solution.&#13;
In summary, then, the usual arguments advanced in support of a&#13;
restriction on migration are seen to be misdirected. The real culprit is&#13;
not migration but labor market imperfections or ill-considered public sector&#13;
investment or pricing policy. The appropriate policy towards migration, in&#13;
particular, and labor mobility, in general, should not be one of restriction&#13;
but one of encouragement.&#13;
1/   Connell et al (1976) also argue that migration is, in part, a result of&#13;
the maldistribution of land ownership. Villages with very unequal land&#13;
distributions experience higher rates of migration.&#13;

Chapter 7: The Operation of Urban Labor Markets&#13;
The existence of large wage differentials for unskilled labor and&#13;
high rates of urban unemployment especially for educated labor were demon-&#13;
strated in Chapters 6 and 3 respectively. In contrast to rural labor markets,&#13;
therefore, there is a strong presumption that many urban labor markets are&#13;
imperfect. Not all markets, however, are equally imperfect, nor are they&#13;
all subject to the same type of imperfection. The analysis begins, therefore,&#13;
with a demonstration of the range of experience in selected labor markets.&#13;
It is argued that minimum wage legislation (especially for unskilled labor)&#13;
and the hiring practices of the public sector (especially for educated labor)&#13;
are the major causes of distortion (that is, intersectoral variation in the&#13;
marginal product of labor of homogeneous quality) and that uncertainty and&#13;
inadequate information flows are the primary causes of unemployment.&#13;
It is also argued that the observed existence of rural-urban wage&#13;
differentials in a variety of historical and contemporary economic environ-&#13;
ments can be explained without invoking institutionally-effected distortions.&#13;
The first alternative focusses on labor heterogeneity, and the second on the&#13;
disequilibrium and dynamic character of migration. The role of adjustments&#13;
in the job-expectations of the educated unemployed is also examined.&#13;
Minimum Wage Legislation and Trade Unions&#13;
Minimum wage legislation is an important feature of labor markets&#13;
in most developing countries    The precise form of the legislation varies&#13;
considerably from country to country, 1/ as does the effectiveness of its&#13;
implementation. Here, three cases are examined in some detail with the&#13;
intention of demonstrating both the consequences of minimum wage legislation&#13;
where it has been effectively enforced and also the difficulties of enforce-&#13;
ment. The three countries are Puerto Rico, Mandatory Palestine (between the&#13;
two World Wars) and Thailand. The evidence presented includes the number of&#13;
workers potentially affected by the legislation, the effectiveness of imple-&#13;
mentation, intersectoral wage differentials, and the narrowing of skill&#13;
differentials. Interwoven into the argument is an assessment of the role of&#13;
trade unions in the maintenance of real wages.&#13;
The study of Puerto Rico by Reynolds and Gregory (1965) documents&#13;
perhaps the classic case of an effectively enforced minimum wage. The evidence&#13;
1/   Descriptions, and in some cases analysis, of minimum wage legislation&#13;
in particular countries are contained in: Gregory (1975) for the&#13;
Philippines, Mexico, Sri Lanka and Kenya; ILO (1970) for Colombia;&#13;
Frank (1968) for Ghana and Uganda; Kannappan (1977,b) for the Sudan;&#13;
Joshi et al. (1974) for Ivory Coast; Atasi (1968) for Syria; Fapohunda&#13;
et al. (1975) for Nigeria; Guisinger (1978) for Pakistan; Bertrand and&#13;
Squire (1979) for Thiland; and Reynolds and Gregory (1965) for Puerto&#13;
Rico. An international survey of minimum wage legislation is available&#13;
in Watanabe (1976).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
on the coverage of the legislation, the correspondence between movements&#13;
in actual and minimum wages, and the erosion of skill differentials con-&#13;
sistently point to the importance of labor legislation in the determination&#13;
of wages.&#13;
In 1938 the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act established a minimum&#13;
wage of 25 cents an hour for all industries engaged in interstate commerce.&#13;
At this time hourly earnings in the Puerto Rican tobacco stemming and needle-&#13;
working industries ranged from 12 to 15 cents. Enforcement measures intro-&#13;
duced in 1940, by which time the minimum had been increased to 40 cents,&#13;
resulted in the suspension of operations in many firms and widespread unem-&#13;
ployment. Relief was soon forthcoming. Tobacco stemming was exempted from&#13;
the provisions of the wage legislation, and although other industries, espe-&#13;
cially needleworking, suffered serious short-term reductions in exports, by&#13;
the end of 1940 the minimum had been reduced to 20 cents with considerable&#13;
variation allowed both within and among industries. This attempt to impose&#13;
mainland U.S. legislation on Puerto Rico illustrates an important point:&#13;
wage legislation which is so out of line with the prevailing economic envi-&#13;
ronment has little chance of success.&#13;
By 1941 additional local legislation ensured that approximately&#13;
60 percent of the total labor force, including agricultural workers, were&#13;
subject to some form of minimum wage legislation. Since that date wage&#13;
legislation has been a major factor in the labor market. For example, in&#13;
1955 almost 70 percent of workers in seventy-six export industries received&#13;
wages within 5 cents of the minimum; 45 percent were paid exactly the minimum.&#13;
Moreover, changes in the minimum have been followed by corresponding changes&#13;
in the wages of those near the minimum. Because higher wages were not always&#13;
adjusted to the same extent, the occupational structure of wages has narrowed.&#13;
After the 1955 change in the minimum from 45 cents to 53 cents, for example,&#13;
average hourly earnings only increased by 4 cents. 1/ Reynolds and Gregory&#13;
conclude: "The closeness of actual hourly earnings in most industries to the&#13;
legal minimum, the parallelism in the timing of upward movements, and the&#13;
tendency for the minimum to encroach gradually on the actual earnings level&#13;
all suggest that it is minimum wage awards which have been forcing the pace&#13;
of wage advance in Puerto Rico since 1950" (Reynolds and Gregory, 1965, p.&#13;
60). It is difficult to disagree with their conclusion. 2/&#13;
Experience in other countries, however, has been markedly different,&#13;
partly because Puerto Rico must be considered a special case. In the first&#13;
place, its labor force in the 1950s was little more than half a million.&#13;
1/   Unemployment rates remained close to 15 percent for males and 10 percent&#13;
for females throughout the 1950s, indicating the presence of positive&#13;
returns to job-search and the availability of income transfers or un-&#13;
earned income to support the unemployed.&#13;
2/   Reynolds and Gregory dismiss trade union activity in a footnote:&#13;
"Collective bargaining, on the other hand, is as yet poorly developed&#13;
and has relatively little effect on the wage structure" (Reynolds&#13;
and Gregory, 1965, p. 41).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
Secondly, by 1955 almost 70 percent of the labor force was already engaged&#13;
in nonagricultural activities. And thirdly, GNP per capita was already&#13;
US$500 (at 1954 prices) in the mid 1950s. It may be expected that the&#13;
effectiveness and coverage of wage legislation is less complete in most&#13;
other countries. The examples of Thailand and Mandatory Palestine illustrate&#13;
this point; they also illustrate the role of trade unions, but in different&#13;
ways.&#13;
Minimum wage legislation in Thailand is of relatively recent origin;&#13;
first introduced in 1973 for four provinces, it was rapidly extended to cover&#13;
the whole Kingdom by 1974. Of particular interest in the Thai case is the&#13;
rather close interaction between the trade union movement and the legislature.&#13;
For example, in 1974, within fourteen days of a demand from striking textile&#13;
workers, the government reached agreement with labor leaders and, on the same&#13;
day, the minimum wage was increased to 20 Baht per day (Bertrand and Squire,&#13;
1979). Similar evidence from other countries suggests that, as in this case,&#13;
trade unions may have their main impact on wages through the agency of minimum&#13;
wage legislation.&#13;
Unlike the example of Puerto Rico, however, minimum wage legislation&#13;
was not nearly so effective in Thailand. To begin with, average wages in&#13;
agriculture and construction remained below the minimum, indicating that the&#13;
effect of the legislation was confined mainly to the manufacturing sector.&#13;
Second, within the manufacturing sector less than 10 percent had wages below&#13;
the 1974 minimum (20 Baht), although almost 40 percent were below the 1975&#13;
minimum (25 Baht). And third, rapid inflation during the period quickly&#13;
eroded the real impact of the legislation. Nevertheless, the legislation&#13;
probably introduced a temporary distortion in the market for low paid labor,&#13;
especially females. This is confirmed by evidence on the narrowing of wage&#13;
differentials: for example, the 5 Baht increase in the minimum between 1974&#13;
and 1975 was fully reflected in the wages of low-paid workers (mainly women)&#13;
but not in those of high-paid workers. The overall impact of the legislation&#13;
on the labor market was thus rather slight; and even for the few workers&#13;
affected the implied distortion was relatively minor.&#13;
The role of trade unions emerges more clearly from the next case&#13;
study. In Mandatory Palestine during the two world wars, the Hisadrut, the&#13;
Jewish labor movement, was preoccupied with the possibility that the standard&#13;
of living of the Jewish workers of European origin would be reduced to that&#13;
of local unskilled Arab labor. In a fascinating piece of historical research,&#13;
Sussman (1973) demonstrates that, despite the existence of well-established&#13;
minimum wage legislation for Jewish labor, the supply of unskilled Arab labor&#13;
"exercised a considerable downward pressure on the wages of unskilled Jewish&#13;
labor, keeping them well below the institutional minimum wage" (Sussman, 1973,&#13;
p. 96).&#13;
Sussman's main pieces of evidence are the large numbers of Jewish&#13;
workers earning less than the minimum, the absence of any noticeable erosion&#13;
of skill differentials and the tendency for Jewish and Arab wages to move in&#13;
tandem. With regard to the first point, in 1937 almost 50 percent of all&#13;
urban adult male workers and over 40 percent of all rural adult male workers&#13;
earned less than the respective urban and rural minima. And with regard to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
the second point, a comparison of the occupational wage structures in 1926&#13;
and 1937 reveals little narrowing that cannot be explained in terms of economic&#13;
forces. And finally, with regard to the comparison of Jewish and Arab wages,&#13;
Sussman shows that manufacturing and construction wages for both types of labor&#13;
moved together throughout the 1930s.&#13;
Sussman concludes that the wages of Jewish unskilled labor "were&#13;
greatly affected by the supply of Arab unskilled labor and far from being&#13;
exogeneously determined" (Sussman, 1973, p. 110). Compared to the Puerto&#13;
Rican example where the coverage of the wage legislation was very extensive,&#13;
the attempt by the Hisadrut to control the wages of Jewish labor was thwarted&#13;
in the Palestinian example by the existence of a plentiful alternative supply&#13;
of cheap labor. Rather than enforce the minimum rigidly and face the conse-&#13;
quences of a switch from expensive Jewish labor to cheap Arab labor, the&#13;
Hisadrut was forced to recognize the interdependency of the Jewish and Arab&#13;
labor markets and to allow Jewish labor to be hired at wages below the&#13;
official minimum.&#13;
Three case studies hardly constitute an adequate base on which to&#13;
draw generalizations. Nevertheless, the experiences of Thailand and Mandatory&#13;
Palestine are similar to those of many other countries. Accepting this, two&#13;
points emerge. First, trade unions often attempt to influence wages through&#13;
political lobbying rather than through collective bargaining; the impact of&#13;
trade unions, therefore, is often inseparable from that of minimum wage&#13;
legislation and the pronouncements of public wage tribunals. 1/ And second,&#13;
the joint influence of trade union activity and public intervention is gener-&#13;
ally limited in coverage and effectiveness. 2/&#13;
The Hiring Practices of Modern Sector Firms&#13;
The hiring practices of modern sector firms are frequently thought&#13;
to be another potential source of labor market distortion. Berg summarizes&#13;
1/   Kilby reaches a similar conclusion on the basis of his analysis of&#13;
Nigerian labor relations. "In sum, there is little doubt that trade&#13;
unions have raised waes in the organized labor market appreciably&#13;
higher than they otherwise would have been. However, this has not&#13;
been achieved by private around-the-table bargaining between repre-&#13;
sentatives of employers and employees as premised in the British system&#13;
of voluntary collective bargaining, rather it has been achieved by&#13;
bringing political pressure to bear on the government, which in turn&#13;
has established independent wage tribunals." (Kilby, 1967, p. 501).&#13;
See also Jackson's conclusion on the role of trade unions in Indian&#13;
industrial relations (Jackson, 1972, p. 187). In addition, econometric&#13;
estimates have usually found the impact of trade unions on wages to be&#13;
insignificant. See House and Rempel (1976) for Kenya and Fong (1976)&#13;
for Singapore.&#13;
2/   Mexico offers an example of extensive minimum wage legislation and&#13;
yet large numbers of workers remain below the minimum (Isbister, 1971&#13;
and Gregory, 1975). Watanabe (1976) presents similar evidence for a&#13;
number of countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
the argument as follows: "The root of the wage problem lies in one fact; the&#13;
export giants and local monopolies are willing, and often more than willing,&#13;
to pay high wages" (Berg, 1969, p. 296). Included in this category are the&#13;
large mining companies and most foreign manufacturing firms. Berg, however,&#13;
is ambivalent on the labor market implications of his diagnosis. On the one&#13;
hand, he points out that those adopting a high wage policy can "choose the&#13;
cream of the available labor force," thereby ensuring "commitment to the&#13;
enterprise" and the "attraction of people most likely to be interested in&#13;
acquiring skills." That is, wage differentials reflect labor heterogeneity.&#13;
On the other hand, he observes that the result is a "distorted inter-industry&#13;
wage structure, with a few enterprises paying rates way out of line with those&#13;
in the rest of the economy." That is, wage differentials reflect a distortion.&#13;
The basic lesson of Berg's analysis is that, by themselves, wage&#13;
rate differentials convey little information. Supplemented with other informa-&#13;
tion, such as measures of labor quality, wage differentials are an important&#13;
part of labor market analysis. This suggests that human capital and institu-&#13;
tional variables (such as firm size or ownership) should be considered jointly&#13;
in explanations of wage differentials.&#13;
Econometric studies incorporating both human capital variables and&#13;
institutional factors are extremely rare. Mazumdar and Ahmed's study of&#13;
Malaysia, however, does provide the necessary depth of analysis and is&#13;
therefore worth describing in detail. 1/ Dividing their sample into unskilled,&#13;
blue collar and white collar workers, the authors demonstrate that, even after&#13;
controlling for variations in education and experience within the three groups,&#13;
plant size remained a statistically-significant determinant of personal incomes&#13;
for blue and white collar workers but not for unskilled labor (Mazumdar and&#13;
Ahmed, 1978). The demonstration that plant size affects labor earnings, at&#13;
least for blue and white collar workers, does not of itself provide any ex-&#13;
planation of the phenomenon. Mazumdar and Ahmed hypothesize that labor&#13;
efficiency responds more than proportionately to an increase in the wage and&#13;
that such a wage-efficiency mechanism is more likely to be associated with&#13;
large than with small plants. In other words, the quality of labor becomes a&#13;
function of the wage paid. 2/ Whatever the correct explanation, the authors&#13;
note that as a determinant of the earnings of blue and white collar workers&#13;
"the relative importance of the plant size variable is small" (Mazumdar&#13;
and Ahmed, 1978, p. 33).&#13;
Other authors have demonstrated that foreign ownership, contrary&#13;
to popular belief, does not entail noticeably higher wages than in domestic&#13;
1/   A comparable study is that of Fong (1976) for Singapore.     His conclusions&#13;
parallel those of Mazumdar and Ahmed.&#13;
2/   As Mazumdar argues in a subsequent paper discussed below, labor hetero-&#13;
geneity may still be the factor underlying the unexplained wage dif-&#13;
ferential if large firms require a more stable labor force and the&#13;
supply price of stable labor exceeds that of casual or temporary&#13;
workers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
firms for comparable skill levels. 1/ Further light can be shed on this&#13;
issue by examining wage differentials in those countries where extractive&#13;
industries are important. The argument here is that the mining sector often&#13;
harbors many large-scale foreign firms which pay wages well in excess of&#13;
the going rates. Table 31 reveals that in at least three cases, Zambia,&#13;
Venezuela and Chile, average wages in mining are considerably above those&#13;
in manufacturing.&#13;
The significance of the extractive sector as a source of labor&#13;
market distortion, however, can be increased if other segments of the&#13;
modern sector keep their wages in line with those in mining. Zambia in&#13;
1966 is a good illustration of this tendency: the 22 percent increase in&#13;
wages enjoyed by miners was followed within eight months by similar or&#13;
even larger percentage increases for central and local government workers,&#13;
shopworkers, workers in building, construction, hotels and agriculture and&#13;
by a 33 percent increase in the general minimum wage (Knight, 1975). The&#13;
example suggests, however, that the effect of increased wages in mining&#13;
will only percolate through other sectors of the economy if it is supported&#13;
by the public sector either through wage increases for civil servants or&#13;
through changes in minimum wage legislation. 2/ In the absence of such&#13;
support, it is not clear that the mining sector by itself would be able to&#13;
generate serious distortions in the labor market especially if the higher&#13;
wages paid in mining reflect, at least in part, differences in the quality of&#13;
labor, 3/ and if the mining sector employs a relatively small part of the&#13;
total labor force (see Table 31).&#13;
Social Security Legislation&#13;
Social security programs and payroll taxation can also contribute&#13;
to labor market distortions in certain circumstances. The major programs&#13;
1/   Lim, for example, reports that the basic hourly wage for 117 foreign&#13;
establishments in Malaysia was 87 cents compared to 81 cents in a&#13;
sample of 191 Malaysian establishments (Lim, 1977). Similarly in&#13;
Africa, 53 percent of multinationals are reported to pay the "going&#13;
rate" for local blue collar workers. A further 30 percent paid no&#13;
more than 10 percent above the going rate (Knight, 1974, p. 81).&#13;
2/   Berg arrives at the same conclusion:    "where wage fixing becomes&#13;
centralized ... the existence of these leading industries ... tends&#13;
to pull wages up .... In public sector wage discussions, in collective&#13;
bargaining where it exists, in industrial courts, wage boards, and&#13;
commissions of inquiry, the high-wage sector becomes the point of&#13;
comparison" (Berg, 1969, p. 298). For three out of four countries&#13;
shown in Table 31, however, waes for low-skill labor in manufacturing&#13;
and agriculture are not markedly different.&#13;
3/   In many cases, however, trade unions probably have exerted upward&#13;
pressure on wages within the mining sector. The mining unions are&#13;
frequently well organized, and are in a strong bargaining position&#13;
because labor costs are such a small part of total costs.&#13;

are confined to Latin America and a few Asian and African countries:&#13;
Colombia, Malaysia, Mexico, Sri Lanka, Venezuela, and Zambia, for example,&#13;
allocate around 3 and 4 percent of GDP to social security, but some countries,&#13;
such as Chile, allocate as much as the industrialized countries - around 15&#13;
percent (ILO, 1976,b). Insurance, again with exceptions such as Chile,&#13;
usually covers 15 to 20 percent of the labor force in Latin America (ECLA,&#13;
1973). Australia, Canada, Sweden and the United Kingdom finance a large&#13;
part of their social security payments from general revenue, but other&#13;
industrialized countries and most developing countries rely primarily on&#13;
payroll taxation. In the latter, taxation rates of around 5 percent on&#13;
employees and 10 percent on employers are not usually (USA, 1971).&#13;
The economic consequences of payroll taxation in developing coun-&#13;
tries have not been well studied. Nevertheless, several theoretical and&#13;
empirical arguments can be advanced concerning its impact. For example,&#13;
the imposition of a payroll tax creates a distortion only to the extent that&#13;
labor views the future benefits from social security as less valuable than&#13;
the current cash income foregone in the form of tax payments. If labor is&#13;
indifferent between (i) a wage inclusive of payroll taxation (both employee's&#13;
and employer's share) and no future benefits and (ii) a wage net of payroll&#13;
taxation and guaranteed future benefits, then the entire tax would be borne by&#13;
labor and neither employers nor employees would change their labor market&#13;
behavior.&#13;

Presumably employees regard the prospect of future benefits as at&#13;
least partial compensation for loss of current earnings, but, provided the&#13;
two are not exactly offsetting, labor market behavior will be affected. In&#13;
this event, the extent to which labor bears the tax will depend on conditions&#13;
in product and labor markets. In developed countries, it is usually assumed&#13;
that most, if not all, of the tax is borne by labor in the long run. Brittain&#13;
(1967), for example, concluded on the basis of cross-sectional analysis that,&#13;
at any given level of productivity, industries in countries with relatively&#13;
high employer payroll taxation pay a basic wage that is relatively lower by&#13;
approximately the same amount. This evidence suggests but certainly does&#13;
not establish, that the full burden of payroll taxation is born by labor.&#13;
Conditions in less developed countries, however, may be sufficiently&#13;
different to nullify this result. In one of the few empirical analyses of&#13;
payroll taxation in developing countries, Rosenberg (1977) argues that the&#13;
supply of labor to the sector covered by social security legislation in&#13;
the Philippines is highly elastic so that most of the payroll tax is borne&#13;
by labor. Rosenberg, in fact, suggests the use of payroll taxation as a&#13;
source of general revenue on both equity and efficiency grounds.&#13;
Hiring Practices in the Public Sector&#13;
The hiring practices of the public sector assume importance in&#13;
most LDCs because civil servants and the employees of public enterprises&#13;
often comprise a significant proportion of the total labor force and an&#13;
even larger proportion of wage employment. Public sector employment is&#13;
also relatively skill-intensive, so that the public sector is often the&#13;
dominant employer of educated labor. 1/ Table 32 provides two measures&#13;
of the extent of public sector employment - its share in the total labor&#13;
force and its share in total wage employment. With regard to the former,&#13;
on average 2/ almost 8 percent of the labor force is in public service. The&#13;
variation among countries, however, is large, Latin America generally having&#13;
higher sahres in public service than either Africa or Asia. The latter&#13;
measure, public sector's share in total wage employment, is much more stable&#13;
with most countries reporting a share of around 15 percent. Thus, total&#13;
wage employment and public sector employment apparently expand with devel-&#13;
opment at more or less the same rate.&#13;
The public sector, therefore, is a very important wage employer.&#13;
The significance of this point is that public sector wages and salaries&#13;
are embodied in official pay scales which are generally thought to be&#13;
unresponsive to changes in labor market conditions. 3/ Sri Lanka provides&#13;

a striking illustration of the consequences of rigid pay scales. Government&#13;
pay scales have long favored clerical and administrative workers over pro-&#13;
fessional and technical workers and continue to do so. For example, a civil&#13;
servant, Class 1, Grade 1, received a salary 60 percent higher than that of&#13;
a doctor MOH 1 in 1948 and 57 percent higher in 1967. Similarly, assistant&#13;
clerks received 40 percent more than unskilled engineering workers in both&#13;
1948 and 1967. At least for these comparisons, the salary structure has&#13;
hardly changed over a period of 20 years (ILO, 1971, Table 21). 1/ And yet&#13;
unemployment rates in 1963 were almost 17 percent for those with secondary&#13;
education and 23.5 percent for those with "O" level certificates; by 1971&#13;
the corresponding figures were 22 and 32 percent (Richards, 1977).&#13;
Perhaps, the most conclusive evidence, that the rigidity of public&#13;
pay scales has distorted the market for educated labor, is found in the job&#13;
preferences of the unemployed. Table 33 shows that while almost 60 percent&#13;
of those with less than Standard 5 education are prepared to accept any job,&#13;
the majority of those with more than Standard 8 education expressed a pre-&#13;
ference for clerical jobs. Apart from the attraction of high wages, the&#13;
public sector also offers job security and regular salary increases. This&#13;
helps to explain why even those who had already experienced extended periods&#13;
of unemployment 2/ were still prepared to wait for clerical jobs. 3/&#13;
The rigidity of public sector pay scales and the stability of job&#13;
preferences emerge as the most likely explanation of the high rates of unem-&#13;
ployment experienced by educated workers. The rapid expansion in educational&#13;
output has not elicited the appropriate response in public pay scales and,&#13;
given the slow rate of adjustment in job expectations, the result has been&#13;
unemployment. Given that the public sector both determines the supply of&#13;
educated workers (through its educational policy) and the demand for such&#13;
(through its role as employer), the solution to the problem of educated&#13;
unemployment is within the immediate sphere of policy influence.&#13;
Labor Heterogeneity&#13;
Enough has been said on labor heterogeneity to warrant some demon-&#13;
stration of its existence and importance. Two sources of heterogeneity are&#13;
discussed here. The first arises from variation in the personal attributes&#13;
which engender commitment and stability, and the second from variation in&#13;
ability, experience and skill.&#13;
1/   Overall, however, the occupational differentials have narrowed.     Similar&#13;
evidence of slowly narrowing differentials in some African and Latin&#13;
American countries is reported in Berg (1969).&#13;
2/   Nearly two-thirds of those surveyed in the 15-24 age-group had been&#13;
unemployed for over 12 months (Richards, 1973, p. 49).&#13;

(1974) for Ivory Coast, and Mulat (1975) for the Sudan.&#13;

In a classic analysis of the historical development of the Bombay&#13;
textile industry, Mazumdar demonstrates the significance of stability and&#13;
commitment for labor market analysis. He argues that the historically observed&#13;
gap between the wage of permanent workers and the supply price of casual labor&#13;
was not inconsistent with labor market equilibrium because permanent and casual&#13;
workers did not constitute a homogenous labor type. On the demand side the&#13;
argument is obvious: employers prefer a stable and committed labor force&#13;
because it reduces turnover costs and ensures that the benefits of on-the-job&#13;
training are retained within the firm. 1/ Mazumdar's contribution was to&#13;
demonstrate that the supply price of permanent labor exceeded that of the&#13;
casual worker because the former, but not the latter, migrated to Bombay&#13;
with their families. Family migrants provided a degree of stability not&#13;
encountered among individual migrants but, at the same time, required a&#13;
larger inducement to migrate. The demonstration that both the demand curve&#13;
and the supply curve for permanent workers differed from that of casual labor&#13;
is sufficient to establish labot heterogeneity and rationalize the observed&#13;
wage gap (Mazumdar, 1973). 2/&#13;

In a subsequent paper, Mazumdar (1978) suggests that the difference&#13;
between the supply price of permanent and casual migrants offers an explanation&#13;
of sectoral wage differentials that does not imply intersectoral misallocation&#13;
of labor. In the Mazumdar formulation, equilibria are achieved by standard&#13;
price adjustments in the markets for two different types of labor. 3/&#13;
The other source of labor heterogeneity, variation in experience&#13;
and educational attainment, is well documented. In a typical study,&#13;
Psacharopoulos (1977) demonstrates that schooling and experience explain&#13;
over 40 percent of the variance in the earnings of male full-time employees&#13;
in Morocco. Mazumdar and Ahmed (1978) in their study of the Malaysian labor&#13;
market demonstrate that both formal education and experience determine earn-&#13;
ings but that the former is more important in larger firms and the latter in&#13;
1/   For a fuller discussion of employer preference for a stable labor force&#13;

noted by Kannappan (1977,b) in the Sudan and by Standing (1978,b) in&#13;
Jamaica.&#13;

small firms. Other studies in this vein include Sanyal and Versluis (1976)&#13;
for the Sudan, Fong (1976) for Singapore and Encarnacion (1974) for the&#13;
Philippines. This growing body of literature attests to the significance&#13;
of labor heterogeneity as a factor in labor market analysis.&#13;
Market Disequilibrium 1/&#13;
Market disequilibrium provides another possible explanation of&#13;
sectoral wage differentials. Much of the analysis associated with the&#13;
theory of the dual economy has sought to explain sectoral wage differentials&#13;
in the context of long-run labor market equilibrium. Apart from transport&#13;
costs, cost-of-living differentials and variations in labor quality, the&#13;
explanation of geographical wage differentials can only be sought in this&#13;
framework in factors such as minimum wage legislation that distort the labor&#13;
market. Given rapid changes in both supply and demand conditions and assuming&#13;
some lag in labor market adjustment, it may be more appropriate to seek the&#13;
explanation of persistent sectoral wage differentials in the dynamics of dis-&#13;
equilibrium economics. That is, observed wage differentials can be inter-&#13;
preted as the manifestation of the process of labor market adjustment, rather&#13;
than as a characteristic of a perfectly equilibrated market. The interaction&#13;
between wage differentials and labor migration in a disequilibrium context&#13;
is an area for potentially fruitful research.&#13;
Labor Market Adjustment&#13;
If future labor market conditions are not known with complete&#13;
certainty, labor heterogeneity introduces an additional potential mechanism&#13;
of adjustment, namely, changes in the job expectations of the unemployed.&#13;
This argument asserts that as the duration of unemployment increases, the&#13;
unemployed worker reduces his income expectations in order to increase his&#13;
chance of obtaining some kind of job. In Kenya, for example, "Many primary&#13;
school leavers who only a few years ago constituted the major employment&#13;
problems now move rapidly into work which a few years ago they would have&#13;
shunned"(ILO, 1972, p. 67). The mechanism thus implies a general upgrading&#13;
of the educational level of given occupations. Such upgrading is a funda-&#13;
mental feature of development; nevertheless, the forced pace of this process&#13;
in many LDCs may cause rapidly declining social rates of return to education.&#13;
This issue is addressed in Part IV. At this point, the objective is simply&#13;
to understand the operation of the market for educated labor.&#13;
Table 34 provides some indication of the transformation of the&#13;
labor force in Sri Lanka by comparing the educational composition of the&#13;
15-24 age group with that of the 45-54 age group. Relatively new entrants&#13;
to the labor market are on average considerably better educated than earlier&#13;
generations: in the 15-24 age group over 60 percent had reached or passed&#13;
grade 6, whereas in the 45-54 age group only 40 percent had done so. If the&#13;
occupational structure of wages remains unchanged, it is highly unlikely that&#13;
the structure of demand will respond to the changes in the educational com-&#13;
position of labor supply. As a result, not all of the more educated entrants&#13;

to the labor force can obtain employment in the type of occupations obtained&#13;
by the previous generation.&#13;
In these circumstances, the unemployed may revise their expecta-&#13;
tions as the duration of unemployment increases 1/ Unfortunately, apart&#13;
from several references to this phenomenon [e.g., ILO (1972), Berry (1975)]&#13;
there is little quantitative evidence available. An exception is a study&#13;
of the labor market in Singapore, in which it is reported that those unem-&#13;
ployed for more than 6 months aspired to lower wages than those unemployed&#13;
for less than six months but the changes in aspirations were not great (Fong,&#13;
1977). Nevertheless, if high unemployment remains a characteristic of the&#13;
economic environment for any length of time, it may be expected that sub-&#13;
sequent generations of school leavers continuously revise their expectations&#13;
downward.&#13;

Chapter 8: Policy Implications&#13;
The evidence on types of market distortion and unemployment rates&#13;
described in previous sections form the basis for judging the importance of&#13;
a number of policy prescriptions. In this section wage policies for unskilled&#13;
labor and educated labor are examined.&#13;
Unskilled Labor&#13;
With respect to unskilled labor, the preceding analysis suggests&#13;
that policy prescription should be based on the following premises:&#13;
(i) unemployment rates for unskilled labor are low in most&#13;
countries;&#13;
(ii) labor is highly mobile both geographically and&#13;
occupationally;&#13;
(iii) sectoral wage differentials can be explained, at least&#13;
in part, by labor heterogeneity and, in the case of&#13;
spatial wage differentials, by cost-of-living differences,&#13;
risk premia, the earner-dependent ratio of migrants and&#13;
the disequilibrium characteristic of the labor market;&#13;
(iv) minimum wage legislation, the main form of intervention&#13;
in the market for unskilled labor, is limited in coverage&#13;
and effectiveness; and&#13;
(v) nevertheless, minimum wage legislation and trade union&#13;
activity have distorted the market for low-paid labor in&#13;
a number of countries.&#13;
The policy inference would appear to be obvious: abolish minimum&#13;
wage legislation and control the unions. This, however, is unlikely to happen.&#13;
Moreover, there are good reasons for wage legislation and trade union support&#13;
especially where oligopsonistic conditions allow employers to take advantage&#13;
of unorganized workers. As a "floor," minimum wage legislation serves a&#13;
useful purpose; as a standard-setting rate for a significant part of the&#13;
unskilled labor force, however, it serves only to create distortions. 1/&#13;
1/   Recommendations that minimum wages be set at levels of income in the&#13;
traditional or agricultural sectors of the economy have been made by&#13;
Turner (1965) and Thormann (1970). In USA, for example, minimum wage&#13;
rates have always been fixed in the range 40 to 54 percent of average&#13;
earnings in manufacturing. Practice in other developed countries --&#13;
Canada and Japan -- has been similar (Watanabe, 1976).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
From the policy perspective, the important issue is the quanti-&#13;
titative significance of distortions in the market for unskilled labor.&#13;
Table 35 presents a number of simple numerical simulations designed to&#13;
illustrate the impact of a reduction in the minimum wage. The underlying&#13;
model is the same as that depicted in Figure 1 of Part 1. The Table shows&#13;
the assumed values for the elasticities of demand 1/ and supply, 2/ and the&#13;
assumed distribution of labor supply. The object of the exercise is to&#13;
calculate the reduction in the minimum wage required to eliminate the&#13;
distortion and to examine the consequences of this reduction for the struc-&#13;
ture of the labor force and marginal productivity in the informal sector. 3/&#13;
The results are easily summarized. First, in every case, excess&#13;
supply is eliminated primarily by a reduction in labor supply, rather than&#13;
by an increase in employment. 4/ Second for low elasticities of demand (less&#13;
1/   Estimates of elasticities of demand are subject to severe problems&#13;
of simultaneous-equation bias and aggregation bias. Most studies&#13;
estimate the elasticity to be close to one. For example, Reynolds&#13;
and Gregory (1965), arrive at an elasticity of 0.94 for Puerto Rico,&#13;
and Harris and Todaro (1969) estimate the elasticity to be 0.76 in&#13;
Kenya. For the public sector, if the wage bill is thought to be&#13;
fixed, the elasticity of demand is exactly one.&#13;
2/   Available estimates suggest an inelastic response in household labor&#13;
supply to changes in the wage, but all estimates refer to rural house-&#13;
holds. Lin, Lau and Yotopoulos (1978) estimate an elasticity of 0.17&#13;
for Taiwan, Barnum and Squire (forthcoming) produce an estimate of&#13;
0.12 for Malaysia, and Bardhan, P. (1977) reports an elasticity of&#13;
0.2 to 0.3 for India.&#13;
3/   The informal sector is defined as that sector not subject to minimum&#13;
wage legislation. See Part I. Given its greater labor intensity,&#13;
demand for labor is assumed to be more elastic in the informal than&#13;
in the formal sector.&#13;
4/   The force of this result decreases with decreases in the elasticity&#13;
of labor supply. In the limit, when the elasticity is zero, the analysis&#13;
requires modification because now excess supply is also zero. This is&#13;
the case where everyone has to have some kind of employment in order to&#13;
survive. The only issue now is the removal of intersectoral differences&#13;
in marginal productivity. From the equations given in the notes to&#13;
Table 35, if U = 0, and   I +  F = 1, then&#13;
dw         -NFF      dw&#13;
w           NI  I    w&#13;
If N    1.0, NI = 1.5,     = 0.2 and   I = 0.8, a 20 percent reduction&#13;
in the minimum wage results in a 3 percent increase in marginal pro-&#13;
ductivity in the informal sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -&#13;
than 0.2, the transfer of labor from the informal sector to the formal sector&#13;
is negligible (less than 1 percent of employment in the informal sector), but&#13;
for higher elasticities it can become significant (over 30% of informal sector&#13;
employment). And third, the increase in marginal productivity in the informal&#13;
sector is only a fraction of the reduction in the minimum wage; 1/ that is,&#13;
given the relative size of the two sectors, marginal products are equalized&#13;
mainly by reductions in productivity in the high wage sector. The essential&#13;
point to emerge is that, if the demand for labor in the distorted sector is&#13;
relatively inelastic, and its share of the total labor force is small, correc-&#13;
tion of the distortion produces little increase in marginal productivity in&#13;
the low-income sector. On the basis of this evidence, it may be argued that&#13;
the removal of distortions in the market for unskilled labor are unlikely to&#13;
have a significant impact, at least in the short term, on the incomes of those&#13;
in the low productivity sectors. If increasing these incomes is an important&#13;
objective, policies other than the removal of labor market distortions will be&#13;
required. 2/&#13;
This is not to deny that the removal of distortions in the market&#13;
for unskilled labor would be helpful especially in some countries. It may&#13;
be useful, therefore, to conclude with a brief survey of wage policies in&#13;
selected countries to provide some indication of the scope for improvement. 3/&#13;
The countries to be considered may be divided into two broad categories --&#13;
countries with "low-wage" policies and countries with "high-wage" policies --&#13;
each of which may be subdivided according to the degree and nature of govern-&#13;
ment intervention.&#13;
The low-wage countries have either intervened to restrain wage rates&#13;
or else allowed the market to function freely. India is a prime example of the&#13;
former group: since 1953, the Indian government has sought to moderate wage&#13;
demands through wage boards, industrial tribunals and labor courts. Singa-&#13;
pore has also exercised wage restraint by curtailing the power of the trade&#13;
unions. In Afghanistan and Thailand, on the other hand, labor markets operate&#13;
relatively freely because of the almost total absence of public intervention&#13;
in Afghanistan and because of its ineffectiveness in Thailand. Other coun-&#13;
tries falling in the low-wage group include Argentina, Brazil, Ghana, Guate-&#13;
mala, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, the Sudan&#13;
and Taiwan.&#13;
1/   For the four cases analyzed, the fraction is 0.01, 0.07, 0.13 and 0.20.&#13;
2/   In a general equilibrium analysis, de Melo (1977) arrives at substan-&#13;
tially higher estimates of the impact on the return to labor of a&#13;
removal of urban labor market distortions in Colombia. As de Melo&#13;
notes, however, "Wage differentials in the industrial sector are viewed&#13;
as distortionary, and to the extent that they are not the welfare results&#13;
reported below will overstate the gain in efficiency from equalizing&#13;
wage rates" (de Melo, 1977, p. 399).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
Although they all fall in the low-wage category, it is worth&#13;
remarking on the important differences between India and Brazil, on the&#13;
one hand, and Korea and Taiwan, on the other. In the former countries,&#13;
the "low-wage" policy is associated with major interventions in product&#13;
and capital markets, whereas the latter countries have sought to maintain&#13;
realistic exchange and interest rates. The employment consequences of&#13;
these different strategies are discussed further in Part III.&#13;
Turning to the high-wage category, a distinction may be drawn&#13;
between countries in which the public sector has actively sought to&#13;
increase wages, and countries where foreign enclaves may have initiated&#13;
wage increases. The East African countries, Nigeria, Puerto Rico, Colombia,&#13;
Sri Lanka and Pakistan fall in the first group. These countries have used&#13;
minimum wage legislation, public sector wage scales and support of trade&#13;
unions to accelerate wage increases in the modern sector. 1/ In the other&#13;
group of countries, which includes Zambia, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago,&#13;
Vepezuela and Chile, important foreign mining enclaves have allowed wage&#13;
increases which have percolated through the rest of the modern sector. The&#13;
foreign enclaves, however, are usually small so that successful percolation&#13;
probably requires considerable public sector support. The distinguishing&#13;
feature of these countries, therefore, lies in the initiating source of wage&#13;
increases rather than in the mechanism which secures their extension to the&#13;
rest of the modern sector.&#13;
Clearly, experience is varied. The East African countries and the&#13;
mineral-producing countries apparently have the most to gain from a move to&#13;
a policy of wage restraint. But these may be the exception rather than the&#13;
rule. As Webb remarks "The "high-wage policy" that allegedly characterizes&#13;
LDCs, and that is routinely attacked in discussions of employment and equity,&#13;
is a misrepresentation of wage policy in LDCs." (Webb, 1977, p. 246).&#13;
Educated Labor&#13;
The argument with respect to educated unemployment is both different&#13;
and more complex. The basic premises are:&#13;
(i) Unemployment rates for educated labor are high in many&#13;
countries;&#13;
(ii) The supply of labor with primary and secondary education&#13;
has increased extremely rapidly;&#13;
(iii) Public legislation and long-established pay scales have&#13;
resulted in inflexible salary structures; and&#13;
(iv) In the absence of wage flexibility, revisions of job&#13;
expectations have been too slow to prevent the emergence&#13;
of unemployment.&#13;
1/   The temporary nature of the present categorization should be kept in&#13;
mind. For example, prior to 1964 Pakistan would be considered a low-&#13;
wage country whereas Argentina would be in the high-wage category.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81 -&#13;
Once again the policy conclusion seems obvious -- increase the&#13;
flexibility of pay scales. 1/ In the short run (that is, when the stock&#13;
of educated labor is given), this would have two consequences. First, the&#13;
occupational structure of employment would change in accordance with the&#13;
supply and demand elasticities at each occupational level; this, in turn,&#13;
would imply a change in the average educational attainment of labor within&#13;
occupational groups in line with the relevant elasticities of substitution&#13;
between educational levels within any given occupational group. And second,&#13;
provided the supply curve of the existing educated labor force is not per-&#13;
fectly inelastic, and that on average the wage for educated labor falls,&#13;
some labor would be withdrawn from the market.&#13;
Although there is very little evidence on demand elasticities&#13;
for labor in general 2/ and none on elasticities for labor at particular&#13;
education levels or for labor in the public sector, the presumption must&#13;
be in favor of at least some elasticity. Nevertheless, provided the demand&#13;
for educated labor is not highly elastic, and there is some elasticity on&#13;
the supply side, some proportion of the unemployed will withdraw from the&#13;
labor force and the investment resources embodied in them will be lost to&#13;
the economy. The main effect, however, will be a lower return to any given&#13;
level of education as the educational quality of any particular job is&#13;
upgraded. This obviously has implications for educational investment.&#13;
Turning to the long-run, the focus of attention switches from&#13;
the market for educated labor to the market for education. As long as the&#13;
public sector continues to subsidize education, private demand for education&#13;
will exceed public supply even if salary scales are flexible. It follows&#13;
that other policy modifications will be required to prevent, or else cope&#13;
with, the emergence of excess demand for publicly provided, and subsidized,&#13;
education. 3/&#13;
Finally, in both the short and the long runs, changes in the&#13;
expectations of recent and prospective graduates may prove significant.&#13;
In a rapidly-changing world, unemployment may reflect inadequate flows of&#13;
information or a failure to adjust labor supply decisions appropriately&#13;
on the basis of the available information. Given the rapid expansion in&#13;
educational output and the equally rapid changes in industrial organizations&#13;
which have occurred in most LDCs, labor supply decisions are almost certainly&#13;
ill-informed and possibly ill-conceived. Information services, labor&#13;
exchanges and job-placement agencies can, therefore, play a vital role in&#13;
securing labor market equilibrium by advancing the rate of adjustment in&#13;
job expectations. 4/&#13;
1/   Specific recommendations are made in, for example, ILO (1971) and&#13;
ILO (1972). For Kenya, ILO (1972) suggests an incomes policy with&#13;
differential rates of increase for low and high wage jobs. ILO also&#13;
recommends a 25 percent cut in public salaries for new recruits.&#13;

Conclusion&#13;
The above analysis of labor markets yields two policy conclusions.&#13;
The more important is that the removal of distortions in the market for&#13;
unskilled labor is unlikely to increase significantly the incomes of low-&#13;
productivity labor in the short-run. If poverty-alleviation is a primary&#13;
goal of economic policy, concern should be focussed mainly on the factors&#13;
influencing labor demand and supply, and not on the operation of the labor&#13;
market per se. Obviously, removing distortions improves short-run alloca-&#13;
tional efficiency and should therefore be encouraged; it also has potentially-&#13;
significant dynamic repercussions on capital accumulation which warrant con-&#13;
sideration. 1/ Nevertheless, the present analysis suggests that the removal&#13;
of labor market distortions will be of limited significance in many countries&#13;
unless supported by other measures.&#13;
The second conclusion is that the high rates of educated unemploy-&#13;
ment signify, not only a failure in the labor market, but also the possi-&#13;
bility that investment in education has been overexpanded. A discussion&#13;
of this possibility, however, is deferred until Part IV.&#13;
1/   This particular aspect is addressed in Part III.&#13;

PART III: POLICIES AFFECTING LABOR DEMAND&#13;
If increasing the efficiency of the unskilled labor market is&#13;
unlikely to have a major impact on labor productivity, factors which produce&#13;
outward shifts in the demand curve for labor assume increased importance.&#13;
Because the demand for labor derives from the demand for output and the con-&#13;
ditions of production, any policy which affects production can also affect&#13;
labor demand. Clearly, some factors will prove more influential than others.&#13;
In this section three of the more important factors - industrial trade policy,&#13;
the growth of agriculture, and improvements in the efficiency of capital&#13;
markets - are examined. This, however, is preceded by a discussion of the&#13;
role of the tertiary and the informal sectors in labor absorption, and of the&#13;
implications for policy of the distinction between tradable and non-tradable-&#13;
producing sectors.&#13;
Chapter 9: Labor Absorption in Services and Informal Activities&#13;
The rapid expansion in the tertiary sector of many LDCs was docu-&#13;
mented in Part I. In particular, it was shown that over the period 1900 to&#13;
1960 three quarters of the reduction in the share of the labor force in agri-&#13;
culture was absorbed into services. 1/ Of itself, this need not cause con-&#13;
cern. The high rates of rural-urban migration, however, made the absorption&#13;
of labor in low-productivity service and manufacturing activities a highly&#13;
visible feature of most LDC cities, and led to the concern that "rural under-&#13;
employment is being exported to the urban informal sector." 2/ Policy advice&#13;
then focussed on means of increasing the productivity and incomes of those&#13;
employed in the "informal sector." The intention here is to place the "over-&#13;
distension" of the tertiary sector (Bairoch, 1973, p. 74) and the role of the&#13;
informal sector in perspective and to pave the way for the subsequent analysis&#13;
of policy measures.&#13;
A crucial distinguishing feature of most service and informal&#13;
activities is that their output is not traded internationally. This has a&#13;
number of consequences. First, unlike tradable commodities, for which demand&#13;
can often be assumed infinitely elastic, nontradable commodities face a&#13;
downward-sloping demand schedule. As a result, measures designed to increase&#13;
nontradable productivity or output also affect product price. Second, the&#13;
demand for nontradable output depends on developments in the rest of the&#13;
economy - the tradable sector will demand intermediate products and services&#13;
and consumers will require final products and services. And third, non-&#13;
tradable production is not subject to the type of policy intervention -&#13;
1/   From Table 1, Part I, it can be seen that the reduction in the share&#13;
of the labor force in agriculture between 1900 and 1960 was approximately&#13;
7 percent; during the same period the share in services increased by&#13;
over 5 percent and that in industry by under 2 percent.&#13;
2/   Bairoch (1973), for example, presents the problem as a choice between&#13;
"urban over-unemployment" and rural underemployment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84 -&#13;
trade tariffs and subsidies - most frequently used to influence tradable&#13;
production. Of course, trade policy ultimately affects nontradables but&#13;
only through the restructuring of tradable production and final consumption&#13;
occasioned by the original change in trade policy. Direct intervention in&#13;
the output market for nontradables usually takes the form of public produc-&#13;
tion. Public intervention can also occur in the markets for factors of&#13;
production and tradable inputs used by the nontradable sector.&#13;
This discussion suggests that before analyzing policy measures,&#13;
it is appropriate to investigate further the sources of demand for services&#13;
and also to examine levels, and rates of change, of productivity in the&#13;
service and informal sectors. The underlying objective is to demonstrate&#13;
that the observed expansion of the tertiary sector is an expected consequence&#13;
of developments elsewhere in the economy and that productivity in the service&#13;
and informal sectors is not generally lower than that in other sectors.&#13;
The Demand for Services&#13;
The tertiary sector is frequently treated as a source of residual&#13;
employment for the rapidly expanding population. This view, however, neglects&#13;
the very obvious point that there must be a corresponding demand for the&#13;
services or else they would not be purchased; more importantly, it neglects&#13;
the growth in demand for services which can be expected to occur as the&#13;
economy develops. In this respect, it is important to distinguish between&#13;
different types of services, of which three are identified here - "new" and&#13;
"old" consumption services and intermediate services. 1/&#13;
"New" services are defined as those for which the income elasticity&#13;
of demand is positive; education, health, tourism, entertainment, and leisure-&#13;
time activities fall into this category. "Old" services, on the other hand,&#13;
have a negative income elasticity of demand and include such activities as&#13;
petty-trading and domestic services. Table 36 presents estimates of employ-&#13;
ment in old and new services for selected developing and developed countries.&#13;
The unweighted means are revealing: old services account for 8.0 percent of&#13;
employment in LDCs compared with 5.5 percent in DCs, whereas new services&#13;
account for only 3.7 percent in LDCs and 9.0 percent in DCs.&#13;
The relationship between employment in services and GDP per capita&#13;
can also be explored statistically. Sabolo (1975,a) reports an elasticity of&#13;
0.55 between the share of employment in new services and income per capita,&#13;
compared with an elasticity of 0.35 between the share of total tertiary&#13;
sector employment and income per capita, indicating that as incomes rise&#13;
an increasing proportion of total tertiary employment is accounted for by&#13;
new services. On the other hand, the elasticity of the share of employment&#13;
1/   This section draws heavily on Sabolo (1975,a).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -&#13;
in old services with respect to income is reported to be -0.32; that is, as&#13;
income rises, the share of employment in old services declines. 1/&#13;
Intermediate services are demanded by other producing sectors, the&#13;
government and also by households. They include transport and communications,&#13;
commerce (net of petty traders who provide old services), banking and finance,&#13;
professional services and government services. Employment in intermediate&#13;
services for a selection of countries is shown in Table 37. In LDCs it&#13;
accounts for almost 60 percent of total tertiary employment; that is, most&#13;
of the employment in the tertiary sector is induced by other activities.&#13;
Sabolo (1975,a) shows that the share of employment in intermediate&#13;
services is postively related to the growth of non-tertiary production, the&#13;
elasticity being 0.2. 2/ This indicates that the development of agriculture&#13;
and industry has an important effect on employment in services. Other evi-&#13;
dence, however, suggests that, by itself, the growth of industrial output does&#13;
not have a significant impact on employment in the tertiary sector until&#13;
fairly late in the development process. For his groups of developed and&#13;
developing countries, Sabolo reports that the elasticity of tertiary sector&#13;
employment growth with respect to the growth of indusrial production is&#13;
positive and significant (0.71) in the first group but positive and insigni-&#13;
ficant (0.17) in the second group. 3/ He attributes this result to the&#13;
relatively immature development of inter-industry linkages in LDCs. 4/&#13;

where E and E are the percentage of total employment in new and old&#13;
services respectively, and Y is income per capita in 1968 US$ (Sabolo,&#13;

ln E  =  0.794 +0.203 In g      R = 0.911&#13;

g is the percentage change in nontertiary GDP (Sabolo, 1975,a,Appendix 2).&#13;

Although not conclusive, this evidence suggests that in the earlier stages&#13;
of development the demand for intermediate services generated by agriculture&#13;
is more important than that generated by industry.&#13;

Productivity in Services&#13;
The above evidence, however, is not entirely convincing, because&#13;
the increases in employment may reflect decreases in productivity. Accord-&#13;
ing to the Chenery-Syrquin (1975) analysis of patterns of development,&#13;
productivity in the tertiary sector declines relative to average productivity;&#13;
nevertheless as shown in Table 38, the tertiary sector remains the most pro-&#13;
ductive sector for levels of development ranging from US$100 to US$1,000 per&#13;
capita at 1964 prices. Far from being a low-productivity sector, services&#13;
are seen to have the highest level of sectoral productivity. This evidence,&#13;
however, must be interpreted with care because the measurement of produc-&#13;
tivity in the service sector, especially for government services, is problem-&#13;
atical. Nevertheless, the data do indicate that total income generated in&#13;
the service sector divided by the total labor force in services exceeds the&#13;
corresponding figures for industry and agriculture.&#13;
Informal Sector&#13;
High average levels of productivity are, of course, perfectly&#13;
consistent with very low levels for certain groups within the service&#13;
sector. Although evidence is not generally available on the numbers in&#13;
low productivity occupations in services, considerable research has been&#13;
undertaken on productivity and income levels in the urban informal sector.&#13;
As noted in Chapter 3, the informal sector is defined in a variety of&#13;
ways but, in empirical exercises, it is usually limited to own-account&#13;
workers and establishments employing fewer than five workers. The presump-&#13;
tion is that minimum wage legislation and other institutional factors have&#13;
little influence on labor earnings in this sector, and that, therefore,&#13;
labor incomes will be uniformly low because of the pressure of excessive&#13;
labor supplies. In fact, labor incomes vary considerably, many of the self-&#13;
employed express no desire for wage employment in the formal sector, training&#13;
and apprenticeship schemes are common, and many entrepreneurs actively seek&#13;

ways to expand their operations. Much of the evidence for these statements&#13;
has emerged from the ILO's World Employment Program, part of which involved&#13;
a consistent analysis of the urban informal sector in selected countries.&#13;
Some of the results are reported below.&#13;
With regard to productivity and incomes, there is ample evidence&#13;
that many in the informal sector do at least as well, if not better, than&#13;
those in the formal sector. For example, the self-employed in Kumasi, Ghana&#13;
are reproted to have higher incomes than those in wage employment (Aryee,&#13;
1977). Approximately 65 percent of those in commerce, and 75 percent of&#13;
those in transport in Greater Sao Paulo, Brazil, had incomes in excess of&#13;
the minimum wage. In personal services, however, only 20 percent earned&#13;
more than the minimum (Schaefer, 1975). In the retail trade in Freetown,&#13;
Sierra Leone "the mean monthly net revenue ... exceeded the mean monthly&#13;
wage of most semi-skilled and clerical grades within the formal wage sector"&#13;
(Fowler, 1978, p. 35). The average family income of those in Calcutta's&#13;
informal industry and trade sector in 1974 was above the officially-established&#13;
poverty line (Bose, 1974). Average income in the informal sector of Abidjan&#13;
was reported to be "close to or above the legal minimum wage" (Joshi, et al.,&#13;
1974, p. 7.11). After the deduction of all operating costs, over 90 percent&#13;
of those in the informal manufacturing sector of Nouakchott (Mauritania)&#13;
enjoyed profits equal to or greater than the wage received by a skilled&#13;
worker in the modern sector (Nihan and Jourdain, 1978). This evidence not&#13;
only indicates the earning capacity of those in the informal sector, but&#13;
also confirms the earlier contention that the existence of minimum wage&#13;
legislation does not necessarily imply sharp earning differentials between&#13;
sectors.&#13;
Other characteristics of the informal sector attest to its dynamism.&#13;
For example, various training activities and apprenticeship schemes exist in&#13;
the informal sectors of Abidjan (Joshi, et. al., 1974), in Freetown (Fowler,&#13;
1978), Nouakchott (Nihan and Jourdain, 1978) and Kumasi (Aryee, 1977). Ex-&#13;
pressed job preferences are also revealing: over 86 percent of sampled&#13;
informal sector participants in Jakarta expressed a preference for self-&#13;
employment (Moir, 1978); only 25 percent of those sampled in Freetown wanted&#13;
wage employment rather than self-employment (Fowler, 1978).&#13;
Perhaps the single most important piece of evidence to emerge from&#13;
these studies is that informal sector entrepreneurs were frequently seeking&#13;
means to expand their activities but invariably cited the high cost of capital&#13;
as the main constraining factor. 1/ In summarizing the results of the African&#13;
studies, Sethuraman comments "As a rule informal sector enterprises find the&#13;
banks unhelpful and unsympathetic to their needs since, unlike their formal&#13;
sector counterparts, they cannot provide the necessary collateral. In Free-&#13;
town, for example, banks provide only 2 percent of investment funds in the&#13;
informal sector, while in Kumasi only 9 out of 298 enterprises had ever&#13;
obtained a loan of any kind from a formal credit institution" (Sethuraman,&#13;
1977, p. 345). Similarly, only 1.5 percent of entrepreneurs in the informal&#13;
sector of Nouakchott had started their business with a bank loan; over 80&#13;
percent had relied on personal savings (Nihan and Jourdain, 1978). Of course,&#13;
1/   See Fowler (1978), Moir (1978), Sethuraman (1977).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -&#13;
if formal sector credit were only available at competitive, rather than&#13;
subsidized rates, excess demand in the informal sector would be correspond-&#13;
ingly curtailed. Moreover, as noted above, given the nontradable charac-&#13;
teristic of informal sector production, output expansion requires price&#13;
reductions. For these reasons, the expressed demand for formal sector&#13;
credit must be interpreted with some reservation.&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
The above analysis of the service and informal sectors was not&#13;
intended to convey the impression that all is well. On the contrary, incomes&#13;
remaining appallingly low. It was intended, however, to demonstrate the&#13;
following:&#13;
(a) both services and informal activities can contribute to&#13;
employment generation and output increases;&#13;
(b) the appropriate way to stimulate demand for the output&#13;
of these sectors is to encourage output growth in the&#13;
tradable sectors of the economy especially, at least in&#13;
the early stages of development, in agriculture; and&#13;
(c) with respect to factor markets, the lack of access to&#13;
formal credit channels constrains expansion in the&#13;
informal sector.&#13;

There are at least two ways of analyzing the employment impact of&#13;
industrial trade policy. The first relies on intercountry or intertemporal&#13;
comparisons to identify broad relationships between employment generation&#13;
and trade policy. The second compares the labor intensity of import-&#13;
substituting and export industries without necessarily identifying the&#13;
policy measures required to switch production from one sector to the other.&#13;
Evidence from both approaches is reviewed here.&#13;
Intercountry Comparisons&#13;
Evidence is first presented on the relationship between the indus-&#13;
trial structure of the labor force and the pattern of development as defined&#13;
by the Chenery-Syrquin trade and production orientation indices (Chenery and&#13;
Syrquin, 1975). 1/ Table 39 reveals that, at both low levels of GDP per&#13;
capita (&lt; US$240 at 1964 prices) and higher levels, the share of the labor&#13;
force in industry is related to the pattern of development. The transforma-&#13;
tion of the industrial structure of the labor force has naturally proceeded&#13;
considerably farther in the industrial countries than in the primary spe-&#13;
cialization countries; it has also proceeded farther in the former group&#13;
than in either the balanced countries or the import-substituting countries,&#13;
at least in terms of the unweighted means. The employment elasticities&#13;
(reported in parentheses in Tabel 39), however, fail to reveal any obvious&#13;
pattern.&#13;
1/   Based on trade and production orientation indices, Chenery and Syrquin&#13;
define four mutually exclusive development patterns. They are:&#13;
(a) primary specialization countries such as Malaysia&#13;
and Venezuela;&#13;
(b) balanced countries such as the Philippines and Peru;&#13;
(c) import-substituting countries such as India and&#13;
Brazil; and&#13;
(d) industrial countries such as Korea and Taiwan.&#13;

The above confirms the expectation that trade policy influences&#13;
the industrial structure of the labor force. A further question of interest&#13;
is the extent to which exports per se influence labor force composition. In&#13;
a study of eighteen developing and twenty-five developed countries, Oberai&#13;
(1978), demonstrates that the elasticity of modern sector employment 1/ with&#13;
respect to the share of exports in GDP is approximately 0.2 for all countries&#13;
and almost 0.5 for the subsample of developing countries. 2/ The composition&#13;
of exports, however, did not exert an independent influence on modern sector&#13;
employment: the percentage of non-primary exports in total exports was not&#13;
significant in almost all the reported regressions especially when considered&#13;
together with the other independent variables. 3/ This suggests that primary&#13;
and non-primary exports increase the demand for modern sector employment to a&#13;
similar degree, the former presumably through an increased demand for distri-&#13;
bution and transport and also through multiplier effects.&#13;
*          Change in the composition of the labor force, however, does not&#13;
necessarily imply an overall increase in the demand for labor. Information&#13;
on movements in wage and unemployment rates constitute important additional&#13;
evidence. Such data, however, are extremely difficult to assemble for an&#13;
international comparison. Evidence is presented in Table 40 on only four&#13;
countries: Sri Lanka (primary specialization), Philippines (balanced),&#13;
Mexico (import substitution) and Korea (industrial). The table highlights&#13;
the difference in the transformation of the industrial structure of the&#13;
labor force and confirms the earlier result; that is, the transformation&#13;
has proceded much more rapidly in Korea than in any of the other countries.&#13;
In fact, the composition of the labor force in Sri Lanka has hardly changed&#13;
in twenty years.&#13;

nonprimary exports in total exports, and the subscripts A and L denote&#13;
all countries and less developed countries respectively (Oberai, 1978,&#13;

3/   Oberai reports essentially the same results when the dependent variable&#13;
is defined as the share of wage employment in total employment. The&#13;
elasticity of wage employment with respect to the share of exports in&#13;
GDP is 0.2 for all countries and 0.3 for developing countries. The share&#13;
of non-primary exports in total exports is not significant.&#13;

Moreover, Korea has enjoyed the fastest growth in real wages, a&#13;
decline in the unemployment rate and a very rapid increase in GDP per capita. 1/&#13;
Sri Lanka has experienced the highest rates of unemployment, and, at least&#13;
since 1960, low rates of increase in real wages. The Philippines has suffered&#13;
a decline in real wages, and rates of unemployment between 6 and 8 percent.&#13;
Mexico, on the other hand, has matched Korea's performance in terms of unem-&#13;
ployment and in terms of real wage increases over the period 1956 to 1972.&#13;
Since 1964, however, Mexican real wage increases have not maintained parity&#13;
with those in Korea, and none of the countries have approached Korea's growth&#13;
rate in GDP per capita. 2/&#13;
Labor Intensity of Manufactured Tradables&#13;
The disadvantage of international comparative studies is that&#13;
several changes are usually occurring at once so that convincing demonstra-&#13;
tions of causality are rare. As an alternative, therefore, some authors&#13;
have sought to compare the labor intensity of exports and import substitutes.&#13;
As late as 1973, however, Hsieh commented that: "in spite of the importance&#13;
of the subject not a single study has been found that devotes itself to a&#13;
thorough and systematic analysis of the direct and indirect effects of export&#13;
expansion on employment in developing countries" (Hsieh, 1973, p. 2). Sub-&#13;
sequent studies focussed on the employment generated by exports without con-&#13;
sidering the possibility of curtained employment elsewhere as a result of&#13;
switching nonlabor factors of production to exports. 3/&#13;
In the short-run, it is appropriate to treat the capital stock as&#13;
given and investigate the employment effect of transferring a unit of capital&#13;
from one sector to the other. Using this approach Westphal (1978) reports&#13;
that the labor-capital ratio for manufactured exports in Korea in 1966 was&#13;
3.24 compared with 2.67 for domestic production and 1.98 for import substitu-&#13;
tion. 4/ In a similar analysis, Krueger (1978) calculates the ratio of labor&#13;
per unit of domestic value added in exportable and import-competing industries&#13;
for selected countries. Her results, reported in Table 41, reveal that export-&#13;
ables are in general more labor intensive than import substitutes.&#13;
Differences in labor intensity of the magnitude reported for Korea&#13;
by both Westphal (1978) and Krueger (1978) hardly seem sufficient to account&#13;
for the substantial increase in industrial employment recorded in Table 40.&#13;
To proceed further, however, it is necessary to abandon the short-run assump-&#13;
tion of a fixed capital stock. The elimination of the policy bias against&#13;

3/   Lydall (1975), Tyler (1976) and Watanabe (1972), for example, fail to&#13;
examine the possibility of foregone employment elsewhere in the economy.&#13;

remains unchanged even if total factor requirements are considered.&#13;

exports can be expected to cause a quantum increase in the marginal rate&#13;
of profit in the exort sector and an increase in GDP. If the supply of&#13;
capital is not highly inelastic, then two consequences may be expected.&#13;
First, resources will be switched from import-substitution to export&#13;
industries. And second, becuse of the higher overall rate of return to&#13;
investment in the economy, and the larger GDP, the rate and level of invest-&#13;
ment will also be increased. Employment thus benefits from both a switch&#13;
to a more labor-intensive mode of production and from an expansion in the&#13;
capital stock. In the specific case of Korea, for example, the capital&#13;
stock in manufacturing is reported to have increased fourfold between 1960&#13;
and 1973 (Westphal, 1978, Table 15). Moreover, gross investment expanded&#13;
from 11 percent of GDP in 1960 to 27 percent in 1975 (Westphal, 1978,&#13;
Table 1). The data attest to both the elasticity of the supply of capital&#13;
and the efficiency of the capital market and suggest that the relative&#13;
factor intensities of exports and import-substitutes may be a less interest-&#13;
ing consideration than the magnitude of the savings response. 1/&#13;
Moreover, industrial trade policy is not concerned solely with&#13;
the balance between exports and import-substitutes. The efficiency of&#13;
industry producing exclusively for the domestic market can similarly be&#13;
impaired by inappropriate tariff structures or heavy reliance on quantitative&#13;
import restrictions. Improvements in this area, therefore, can also be ex-&#13;
pected to have favorable employment effects.&#13;

growth rate of industrial output and not to its higher employment&#13;

the employment elasticity was 0.67; in Mexico the rate of increase in&#13;

Conclusion&#13;
The significance of industrial trade policy in the present&#13;
context turns on its contribution to employment creation. In this respect,&#13;
it appears that the following conditions are necessary if a move towards&#13;
free trade is to have a quantitatively significant impact on the demand&#13;
for labor:&#13;
(a) existing policies must constrain the expansion of exports&#13;
in particular or reduce the efficiency of domestic industry&#13;
in general; and&#13;
(b) complementary factors of production - human and physical&#13;
capital - must be in elastic supply.&#13;
For low-income countries existing policies may not be the effective&#13;
constraint on exports. The significance of industrial trade policy for these&#13;
countries, therefore, lies mainly in its impact on production for the domestic&#13;
market. The resulting increase in employment growth, however, is likely to be&#13;
small relative to the annual increment in the labor force. For example, if&#13;
the rate of growth in industrial employment in low-income Africa and Asia&#13;
were suddenly doubled (an unlikely event), the industrial sector would still&#13;
only absorb less than half of the projected growth in the labor force. 1/&#13;
Nevertheless, a rationalization of industrial trade policy does yield an&#13;
unambiguous increase in labor demand and should be encouraged. Moreover,&#13;
apart from quantitative considerations, increased industrial sector employ-&#13;
ment yields a benefit in terms of improved labor quality (and hence higher&#13;
wages) as a result of skill acquisition through on-the-job training.&#13;
In the middle-income countries which are still embracing import-&#13;
substitution policies, the employment impact of a more rational trade policy&#13;
will be, and in several cases has been, substantial. 2/ For these countries,&#13;
the significance of industrial trade policy lies more clearly in its impact&#13;
on production for export and is also likely to yield more indirect employment&#13;
than in low-income countries because of better-developed industrial linkages.&#13;
1/   The industrial sector accounts for approximately 10 percent of the labor&#13;
force and has been growing at about 4 percent annually. Projected rates&#13;
of annual labor force growth are above 2 percent. Thus, a rate of growth&#13;
in industrial employment of 8 percent times the share of industry in the&#13;
total labor force (0.10) equals 0.8 percent which is less than half of&#13;
the labor force growth rate.&#13;

Much of the literature on the transformation in the structure&#13;
of the labor force is concerned with the movement of labor out of the&#13;
primary sector. This is consistent with Clark's view on changes in the&#13;
pattern of demand and intersectoral differences in productivity growth as&#13;
discussed in Part I. This approach, however, does not treat the time dimen-&#13;
sion explicitly and hence does not specify the optimal rate of transformation.&#13;
It was argued in Part I that, compared with historical experience, the rate&#13;
of transformation in the LDCs has been retarded by rapid population growth.&#13;
It is now argued that given the observed rates of population growth the&#13;
transformation has been too fast in some countries because policy has effec-&#13;
tively constrained the demand for agricultural labor. Abstracting from labor&#13;
market imperfections, this argument asserts that the intersectoral equaliza-&#13;
tion of labor's marginal product occurs at a lower level of demand for agri-&#13;
cultural labor than would otherwise be the case, because of policy discrimi-&#13;
nation against agriculture in general and agricultural labor in particular.&#13;
The Internal Terms of Trade&#13;
The import-substitution policies adopted by many LDCs in the 1950s&#13;
and 1960s have had significant implications for the development of agricul-&#13;
ture. Protection acts as a tax on agriculture because it raises the price&#13;
of manufactured goods relative to agricultural goods in the domestic market.&#13;
Moreover, the existence of import restrictions maintains the exchange rate&#13;
at a higher level than would be the case under free trade, so that the agri-&#13;
cultural exporter receives less domestic currency for a given quantity of&#13;
exports.&#13;
As an approximate measure of the bias against agriculture, Table 42&#13;
shows sectoral contributions to GDP and GDP growth with and without allowance&#13;
for protection. That is, if value added is measured at world prices and&#13;
allowance is made for an overvalued exchange rate, GDP originating in agri-&#13;
culture is increased by, for example, 10 percent in the Philippines and GDP&#13;
in manufacturing is reduced by 20 percent. Similarly, the growth rate of&#13;
agricultural GDP is increased by a half in the Philippines when measured&#13;
at world prices, whereas the manufacturing growth rate is reduced by almost&#13;
one-third.&#13;
The implications for labor demand of the sectoral misallocation of&#13;
resources suggested by the above estimates are identical to those discussed in&#13;
the case of exports. That is, for a given capital stock labor demand is&#13;
increased if the marginal capital-labor ratio is lower in agriculture than in&#13;
manufacturing, and in the long-run the removal of the distortion in the product&#13;
market will increase total GDP and the economy-wide rate of profit which in&#13;
turn will induce more savings. The absence of empirical evidence on sectoral&#13;
capital-labor ratios, however, is complete. Comparisons which allow fully for&#13;
the investment cost of increasing the availability of water and other agricul-&#13;
tural inputs are not generally available. And, as noted in the discussion of&#13;
exports, the long-run argument requires an efficiently-operating capital market&#13;
and an elastic supply of savings. Nevertheless, the presumption should&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 99 _&#13;
generally be that a movement to restore the industry-agriculture balance&#13;
will shift the economy-wide demand curve for labor to the right.&#13;

Farm Size&#13;
One of the most persistent findings of empirical research is that&#13;
labor intensity and yield decrease as farm size increases. Two illustrations&#13;
of this tendency are provided in Table 43. 1/ Value added per unit of area on&#13;
small farms (less than three hectares) in Colombia is almost five times larger&#13;
than the average for all farms. The corresponding figure for Pakistani small&#13;
farms (less than one acre) is 3.2. Farms over 500 hectares in Colombia use&#13;
10 percent and farms over 150 acres in Pakistan use 80 percent of the lbor&#13;
input applied per unit of area on the average farm.&#13;

These and similar results have attracted great attention in the&#13;
literature because they suggest the possibility of simultaneously increasing&#13;
output and improving the distribution of that output by an appropriate land&#13;
reform. Cline, for example, claims that "The single most powerful policy&#13;
instrument for the combined objectives of rural equity and output growth is&#13;
land reform" (Cline, 1977, p. 281). The argument has been made most force-&#13;
fully in the Latin Amercian context where the distribution of farms by size is&#13;
highly skewed and average farm size is much larger than in either Asia or&#13;
Africa. These points emerge very clearly from Table 44: according to the&#13;
unweighted means, the Gini coefficient for the size distribution of farms&#13;
exceeds 0.8 in Latin America but is close to 0.5 for Asia and Africa; differ-&#13;
ences in average farm size are even more marked, the average Latin American&#13;
farm being 20 times larger than its Asian or African counterpart.&#13;
Before concurring with Cline's view, however, it is important to&#13;
consider the causes of the observed differences in factor use. Dynamic con-&#13;
siderations, such as the adoption of new technologies, also require attention.&#13;
Moreover, apart from assessing the desirability of land reform, it is equally&#13;
essential to consider questions of implementation. The historical experience&#13;
of past land reforms, therefore, is pertinent. These issues are addressed&#13;
below.&#13;
Factor and Input Market Distortions 1/&#13;
There are three reasons why the yields and factor usage of large&#13;
farms differ from those of small farms:&#13;
(a) large and small farms face different production technologies;&#13;
(b) large and small farms face different configurations of factor&#13;
and product prices; and&#13;
(c) large and small farms are operated according to different&#13;
principles.&#13;
Treating them in reverse order, reason (c) is based on the distinction&#13;
between subsistence, or utility-maximizing, farms and commercial, or profit-&#13;
maximizing, farms. If for subsistence farmers the supply price of labor to&#13;
off-farm employment lies below that to on-farm employment, more labor will be&#13;
applied per unit of area, and hence yields will be higher, on utility-maximizing&#13;
farms (usually thought to be small) than on profit-maximizing farms (usually&#13;
thought to be large). 2/ As demonstrated in Chapter 5, however, the available&#13;
evidence on this type of labor market dualism is not convincing. Moreover,&#13;
tests of profit-maximizing behavior, based on both profit and production&#13;
functions, usually confirm that small and large farms are operated in an&#13;

equally efficient manner. 1/ Finally, the evidence on labor market partici-&#13;
pation documented in Chapter 5 suggests that, even if labor market dualism&#13;
does exist in some areas, its importance is likely to diminish with time.&#13;
Reason (b) is perhaps the most frequently cited. Labor markets are&#13;
characterized as monopsonistic and capital markets as segmented. Monopsonistic&#13;
labor markets serve to reduce the overall demand for labor, while segmented&#13;
capital markets provide a source of cheap capital for large farms. Of the two,&#13;
the latter has received more attention. A number of studies, for example,&#13;
have produced evidence showing the labor-displacing effect of mechanization.&#13;
In a review of the literature in 1971, Yudelman et al., conclude as follows:&#13;
"Using comparative data for owners and non-owners (of tractors) and intertem-&#13;
poral data for the same group of cultivators (before and after purchasing&#13;
tractor equipment), it was clearly established that the introduction of large-&#13;
scale machinery resulted in substantial reduction in the labor requirement&#13;
within the range 12-27 percent man-days per hectare" (Yudelman et al., 1971,&#13;
p. 100). The authors qualify their conclusion with the remark that "Selective&#13;
mechanization may relieve seasonal shortages without unduly displacing labor.&#13;
However, it should be stressed that purposive studies, considering all the&#13;
aspects of selective mechanization, are lacking" (Yudelman et al., 1971, p.&#13;
100). Similar conclusions are reached by Bardhan, K. (1977) in her survey&#13;
of the Indian literature, by Abercrombie (1972) in his review of Latin American&#13;
experience and by Bartsch (1977) in his survey of Asian experience.&#13;
Of itself, mechanization does not indicate a misallocation of re-&#13;
sources. Most authoris writing on the issue, however, point to the importance&#13;
of interest and exchange rate policies in determining the rate of mechanization.&#13;
Barker et al (1972), for example, report that, although the stated objective of&#13;
the Filipino government was to provide credit at favorable interest rates for&#13;
mechanization on small farms, their program actually served to finance the&#13;
purchase of tractors on large farms. When the peso was allowed to float in&#13;
1970, however, the demand for loans slackened noticeably.&#13;
As shown in Tables 45, 46 and 47 unequal access to credit and other&#13;
subsidized inputs is a general finding. With the notable exceptions of Taiwan&#13;
and Korea, institutional credit usually reaches less than a quarter of the farm&#13;
population (Table 45). Moreover, even in the case of public institutions de-&#13;
signed to provide credit to small farms, large and medium farms often receive&#13;
most of the available funds: of the fifteen such programs documented in&#13;
Table 46, thirteen channeled less than a quarter of their funds to small&#13;
farms. Small farms receive very few loans from other institutions and are&#13;
forced to rely on informal sources, which can be expected to charge very high&#13;
rates of interest. The disparity between formal and informal interest rates&#13;
is very apparent from Table 47. Real interest rates charged by agricultural&#13;
credit institutions are often very low or even negative, whereas real rates&#13;
in excess of 50 percent are not unusual in the informal market. 2/&#13;
1/   See, for example, Sidhu (1974) and Barnum and Squire (1978).&#13;
2/   The real cost of providing institutional credit is estimated to range&#13;
from 15 to 20 percent (World Bank, 1975,b).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 104 -&#13;
As a result, mechanization is concentrated on large farms. In&#13;
Chile in 1963, for example, farms of more than 50 hectares had 93 percent&#13;
of all tractors; in Colombia in 1960 they had 66 percent of all tractors;&#13;
and in Mexico in 1960 they had 75 percent of all farm machinery (Abercrombie,&#13;
1972). The evidence is fairly convincing, therefore, that factor price&#13;
distortions, especially segmentation in the capital market, have advanced&#13;
the rate of mechanization on large farms. 1/&#13;
Reason (a), which asserts that large and small farms face different&#13;
technologies, is also related to the issue of unequal access to subsidized&#13;
inputs and to the rate of adoption of new techniques. The adoption of high-&#13;
yielding varieties of seed, inorganic fertilizers, and chemical pest and weed&#13;
controls has frequently occurred on large farms at least in the first instance.&#13;
This may reflect unequal access: large farms have more direct contact with&#13;
government seed-and-credit programs and subsidized fertilizer programs. It&#13;
may also reflect imperfect information flows and differences in risk-taking&#13;
behavior. Either way, large farms have adopted the seed-fertilizer'irrigation&#13;
package more quickly than small farms. 2/ This is of considerable significance&#13;
because the package is universally considered to be land-augmenting. Cline&#13;
(1977), however, suggests that adoption will gradually spread to smaller&#13;
farms especially if credit and inputs can be effectively channeled to them.&#13;
Recent Historical Evidence - Japan, Taiwan and Mexico 3/&#13;
The recent historical experience of Japan, Taiwan and Mexico illus-&#13;
trates the interactions of land distribution, the availability and spread of&#13;
technological innovations and productivity in agriculture. The relevant data&#13;
are reported in Table 48. In all three countries agricultural output has&#13;
increased by at least 3 percent. In Japan and Taiwan the increase in output&#13;
is accounted for almost entirely by increases in yield, land area remaining&#13;
virtually constant. This suggests that technological change has been land-&#13;
augmenting in both countries. The 5.8 percent growth rate of labor produc-&#13;
tivity in Japan, however, is much higher than that recorded in Taiwan (3.3&#13;
percent). This, in turn, suggests that at least in Japan technology has&#13;
also been labor-saving. Yudelman et al (1971) document changes in inputs&#13;
which support these inferences. They conclude "The technology of Japanese&#13;
agriculture has been adapted to circumstances that are similar to those in&#13;
many labor-scarce developed countries. A decline in the labor force in&#13;
agriculture has been accompanied by the introduction of labor-saving technology,&#13;
along with the continued use of high yielding technology. In Taiwan, though&#13;
a continuing increase in the number of people engaged in agricultural produc-&#13;
tion has tended to obviate the need for the introduction of a labor-saving&#13;
technology" (Yudelman et al 1971, p. 108).&#13;
1/   Most authors writing on rural credit programs criticize the provision&#13;
of cheap credit to large farmers. See, for example, Yudelman et al&#13;
(1971), Berry and Cline (forthcoming), Cline (1977), Abercrombie (1972),&#13;
Bartsch (1977), and Barker et al (1972).&#13;

The development of agriculture in Mexico has been quite different.&#13;
Over half of the increase in output is attributed to an expansion in the area&#13;
cultivated. Both labor productivity and yields have increased at rates con-&#13;
siderably lower than those recorded in Japan and Taiwan. For the present&#13;
purpose, the most important inference to be drawn from Table 48 is that, in&#13;
terms of the aggregate growth rates of labor productivity and yields, there&#13;
has been no labor-saving, and little land-augmenting, technological change.&#13;
The available data on input use, however, belie both these assertions: be-&#13;
tween 1950 and 1960 agricultural tractor utilization per worker increased two-&#13;
fold, and between 1948 and 1968 the total consumption of fertilizers in terms&#13;
of plant nutrients increased at an annual average rate of 15.6 percent. 1/&#13;
The discrepancy between the evidence on input increases and the&#13;
observed changes in the aggregate growth rates of labor productivity and&#13;
yields is resolved by an examination of the structure of Mexican agriculture.&#13;
Unlike that of Japan and Taiwan, agriculture in Mexico comprises a small&#13;
modern sector and a large traditional sector.   The former supports market&#13;
oriented farms with an average holding in 1960 of 27.3 hectares. The latter&#13;
contains small private farms of less than 5 hectares and most communal ejidos:&#13;
it also occupies 70 percent of the agricultural labor force. Mechanization&#13;
and the use of fertilizers have been concentrated in the modern sector where&#13;
the yields of the principal crops - wheat and cotton - have increased notice-&#13;
ably. In the traditional sector, output growth, for such crops as corn and&#13;
beans, was induced primarily by an expansion of acreage. Thus, despite an&#13;
increased use of both land-augmenting and labor-saving technologies in the&#13;
modern sector, economy-wide yields and labor productivity failed to show any&#13;
marked improvement.&#13;

An important difference between the Japanese and Taiwanese exper-&#13;
ience, on the one hand, and the Mexican experience, on the other hand, lies&#13;
in the diffusion of technical knowledge and the distribution of inputs. The&#13;
size distribution of land holdings is clearly one possible explanation of&#13;
this difference. In Japan and Taiwan land reform conferred rights of owner-&#13;
ship within an existing, fairly even distribution of operational units. In&#13;
Mexico, however, land reform involved expropriation and redistribution of only&#13;
part of the total land area.   Moreover, whereas in Japan and Taiwan agriculture&#13;
retained its family-farm characteristic, the ownership of expropriated lands&#13;
in Mexico was entrusted to the community.&#13;
Other factors, however, were also important.    For example, while&#13;
irrigation facilities cover a substantial part of the total cultivated area&#13;
in Japan and Taiwan, in Mexico they are confined to the regions where large&#13;
cQmmercial farms predominate. Similarly, the use of fertilizer is widespread&#13;
in Japan and Taiwan but is confined to the irrigated areas, and hence the&#13;
modern sector, in Mexico. Moreover, information on fertilizer and other&#13;
inputs is effectively disseminated to all farmers in Japan and Taiwan through&#13;
farmers' associations, which also organize the distribution of inputs, market&#13;
output and provide credit. Similar institutions do not exist to the same&#13;
extent in the traditional sector of Mexico. The modern sector, however, has&#13;
access to government-subsidized credit for the purchase of farm machinery.&#13;
Policy Inference&#13;
As far as labor demand is concerned, the evidence clearly points&#13;
to the virtues of land-augmenting technological change and of selective,&#13;
but not general, mechanization. The outstanding issue concerns the appro-&#13;
priate policies for ensuring that the desired technological developments&#13;
actually occur.&#13;
Some authors view the evidence on farm size, yields and labor&#13;
intensity as a clear indication of the desirability of land reform. In&#13;
their discussions, however, the same authors point to the unequal access to&#13;
credit, fertilizer, and seed as an important factor underlying the observed&#13;
variation in yield and labor input. This suggests that the efficiency gains&#13;
claimed by land reform can be achieved by improvements in market operation&#13;
without reformation of the landownership system.    Specifically, the following&#13;
should be considered:&#13;
(a) The removal of incentives - subsidized credit, subsidized&#13;
fuel, and overvalued exchange rates - favoring mechanization,&#13;
(b) The diffusion of public sector investment in irrigation,&#13;
transport and communications, and extension services&#13;
throughout the agricultural sector, and the provision&#13;
of equal access to credit regardless of farm size, 1/ and&#13;
(c) Increased support for agricultural research at both the&#13;
national and international levels.&#13;

Improvements in product and capital markets of the type suggested&#13;
here may well constitute the sole instance of a potentially substantial&#13;
short-run employment benefit, especially in low-income countries where&#13;
agriculture's share of the labor force still exceeds 70 percent. Agriculture&#13;
offers considerable scope for factor substitution both within and between&#13;
crops. Indirect employment effects are also likely to be more important as&#13;
a result of agricultural, rather than industrial, expansion in these countries.&#13;
Land reform may still be considered desirable in addition to the&#13;
above.  In this event, its costs and benefits should be assessed primarily&#13;
in terms of its implications for income distribution. Short-run costs of&#13;
implementation have been high in some cases, and the commitment to reform&#13;
has sometimes been less than complete. 1/ The pursuit of tenurial stability&#13;
and security may be a politically more acceptable approach which can be&#13;
expected to confer dynamic efficiency benefits. 2/ It is essential, however,&#13;
that both land and tenurial reform be accompanied by the widespread provision&#13;
of inputs, credit, services and information as described above, if productivity&#13;
is to be increased.&#13;

Chapter 12: Capital Markets&#13;
At various points in this Section reference has been made to the&#13;
significance of an efficiently-operating capital market. In the discussion&#13;
of the urban informal sector, for example, the demand by small-scale entre-&#13;
preneurs for access to formal channels of (subsidized) credit emerged very&#13;
clearly. Precisely the same point arose in the discussion of agricultural&#13;
development where it was argued that segmented capital markets have had&#13;
significant implications for labor demand: the availability of cheap credit&#13;
to large farms has encouraged labor-displacing mechanization, while the cost&#13;
of informal credit has retarded the adoption of the land-augmenting water-&#13;
seed-fertilizer technology. Finally, it was suggested that export-led growth&#13;
in, for example, Korea was facilitated by the operational efficiency of the&#13;
capital market:   the response of savings and investment to higher levels of&#13;
GDP and increased possibilities for profit was in part the result of a well-&#13;
developed capital market.&#13;
The existence of highly localized and fragmented capital markets&#13;
clearly points to the possibility of gains in the efficiency of resource&#13;
allocation from market unification. 1/ This is analogous to the argument&#13;
in Part II concerning the removal of policy-induced distortions in the labor&#13;
market. There the objective was to remove intersectoral wage differentials&#13;
resulting from for example, labor legislation. Here the objective is to&#13;
remove differentials caused by interest rate ceilings and the like. Frag-&#13;
mented capital (and labor) markets also result from transport and information&#13;
costs. In this event, market unification may still yield efficiency benefits&#13;
but only at a cost.&#13;
The manner in which improvements in the capital market impinge&#13;
on the demand for labor is complicated. Four effects, however, seem poten-&#13;
tially important. First, for a given level of institutionally-provided&#13;
credit, assume that allocation by rationing in a market restricted to&#13;
preferred customers is replaced by price allocation in a market open to&#13;
all entrepreneurs. In this event, the impact on the demand for labor will&#13;
depend on the technological characteristics of production of the previously-&#13;
preferred and the newly-accepted customers and on the reallocation of invest-&#13;
ible resources between the two groups.    Second, assume that the increase in&#13;
the lending rate of interest implied by the first effect, leads to an increase&#13;
in the deposit rate. Assume further that the economy-wide rate of saving&#13;
(including self-investment) remains unchanged. Again an improvement in&#13;
resource allocation will occur because financial savings will now comprise&#13;
a larger share of total savings. The resulting decline in low-yielding&#13;
self-financed investment will allow a corresponding expansion in higher-&#13;
yielding market-financed investment. 2/ The ultimate impact on labor demand&#13;
will depend on the production technologies involved as before.&#13;
1/   This is the central theme in McKinnon (1973).&#13;
2/   This particular effect is examined in terms of a two-sector model&#13;
by Galbis (1977).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 112 -&#13;
Third, the improvement-in (static) resource allocation implied by&#13;
the previous two effects may have an impact on the economy-wide rate of saving&#13;
including self-investment. If this rate is assumed to increase, as a result&#13;
of the higher level of GDP, labor demand would be affected favorably. And&#13;
fourth, the capital market may be further improved by expanding the array of&#13;
financial assets available to the potential saver and reducing transaction&#13;
costs. This should unequivocally increase the overall level of savings and&#13;
hence the demand for labor. 1/&#13;
The above suggests that the static impact of improvements in the&#13;
operational efficiency of the capital market on labor demand (the first and&#13;
second effects) will depend crucially on the technology of production in&#13;
different sectors of the economy. The dynamic impact (the third and fourth&#13;
effects), however, depend on the determinants of savings behavior. Some of&#13;
the available empirical evidence on these issues is reviewed below.&#13;
Capital-Labor Ratios&#13;
Within manufacturing the available evidence, albeit scant, indicates&#13;
that investment per job increases with the scale of investment. The data in&#13;
Table 49, for example, suggest that small scale manufacturing enterprises use&#13;
four to ten times as much labor per unit of fixed investment as their larger&#13;
counterparts. Very much lower figures than those shown in Table 49 have been&#13;
reported for manufacturing enterprises operating in the urban informal sector.&#13;
According to Fowler (1978), for example, capital per worker in the manufac-&#13;
turing enterprises of Freetown's informal sector averaged less than US$60. 2/&#13;
Other estimates for India and Ghana reveal equally low figures. 3/&#13;
Apart from lower capital-labor ratios, there is also some evidence&#13;
that value-added per unit of capital is higher in small-scale manufacturing&#13;
units. The relevant data are reported in Table 50. For India, Malaysia and&#13;
Mexico an inverse relationship between establishment size and capital produc-&#13;
tivity is confirmed, but the relationship is much less clear in Pakistan and&#13;
is reversed in the Philippines.&#13;

Notes&#13;
1/   The data reflect investment decisions taken five to twenty years ago.&#13;
Allowance for depreciation and inflation would change the absolute&#13;
numbers but not their relative size. Rough estimates suggest that&#13;
at 1976 prices average fixed assets per job would lie in the range&#13;
$1,000 to $3,000 for small enterprises and between $10,000 and $20,000&#13;
for medium and large enterprises (World Bank, 1978,c).&#13;
Source&#13;
World Bank (1978,c), Table 1:2.&#13;
Neither capital productivity nor labor intensity, however, is a&#13;
satisfactory measure of overall efficiency. The most that can be established&#13;
from the available data is that small firms are labor intensive and that there&#13;
is no reason to suppose that they are inefficient. Nor is there any reason&#13;
to suppose that large scale enterprises are necessarily inefficient. Never-&#13;
theless, if access to credit is extended to all enterprises at competitive&#13;
rates, an expansion in the small scale sector relative to the large scale&#13;
sector can be expected, because of the previous differential access to sub-&#13;
sidized credit which clearly favored larger enterprises. 1/&#13;
The resulting gain in employment, however, cannot be derived immed-&#13;
iately from a comparison of labor intensities because, if the wage-rental&#13;
ratio is changed, some impact on factor proportions can be expected - small-&#13;
scale enterprises will retrench on their use of labor and vice versa in&#13;
large-scale enterprises. Depending on the relative magnitudes of the sectoral&#13;
elasticities of substitution and the initial distribution of employment between&#13;
large and small enterprises, the overall effect on labor demand could be&#13;
strengthened or weakened. The ultimate impact on labor demand thus remains&#13;
ambiguous. 2/&#13;
1/   An extreme example is reported in Guisinger (1978).    He claims that&#13;
between 1960 and 1972 small investors faced user costs of capital&#13;
more than twice those of their large-scale counterparts.&#13;
2/   Available evidence on factor substitution possibilities is discussed&#13;
in recent reviews by White (1978) and Pack (1978). Programs providing&#13;
technical and other types of assistance to smallscale enterprise are&#13;
described in Neck (1977).&#13;

The case, from an employment point of view, for capital market&#13;
unification in agriculture is stronger. The evidence on the labor-displacing&#13;
effects of mechanization and the land-augmenting effect of the water-seed-&#13;
fertilizer package has already been described. If credit is made available&#13;
to all farms at competitive rates, it may be expected that the rate of&#13;
mechanization will be reduced and that more farms will be able to adopt the&#13;
water-seed-fertilizer technology. The realization of either expectation will&#13;
have a favorable impact on labor demand.&#13;
Determinants of Savings&#13;
The determinants of saving in LDCs, especially in rural areas,&#13;
remain unclear. In a recent survey of the econometric literature, Saito&#13;
(1977) reports that a positive relationship between saving and income is&#13;
confirmed and that, in poorer countries at least, the marginal propensity&#13;
to save is an increasing function of household income. The relevance of&#13;
the permanent income hypothesis for developing countries is also supported,&#13;
the marginal propensity to save from transitory income exceeding that from&#13;
permanent income.&#13;
The available evidence on the relationship between interest rates&#13;
and household saving is contradictory and inconclusive. The few empirical&#13;
studies which investigate this relationship are open to methodological crit-&#13;
icisms and subject to data deficiencies especially with respect to the interest&#13;
rate variable. A recent study in rural India represents one of the more care-&#13;
ful attempts at identifying the determinants of savings. Among the findings&#13;
of this study are the following. First, the marginal propensity to save is&#13;
an increasing function of income within a certain range of income levels.&#13;
Second, the propensity is related positively to the expected rate of return&#13;
on farm investment. And third, subsidized credit for rich farmers depresses&#13;
their propensity to save (Bhalla, 1978).&#13;
Although confirming a positive and increasing marginal propensity&#13;
to save, available studies provide no indication of the relationship between&#13;
the overall "adequacy" of the financial system and savings, where "adequacy"&#13;
denotes a variety of qualitative characteristics, such as range and avail-&#13;
ability of services, as well as the structure of interest rates. A number&#13;
of case studies, however, illustrate the possibilities of mobilizing savings.&#13;
Saito (1977), for example, reports the success of the Post Office Savings&#13;
Scheme in mobilizing savings in Sri Lanka despite negative real rates of&#13;
interest. Nonprice attributes, such as low-risk and accessibility, were&#13;
thought to have attracted savers in this instance.&#13;
The Syndicate Bank in India provides a striking example of a deter-&#13;
mined effort to reduce the transaction costs associated with the provision&#13;
of banking services to small-scale farms and enterprises. 1/ In 1968, 30&#13;
percent of its loans were to agriculture and small enterprises and 90 percent&#13;
of its deposit accounts were for amounts under Rs 1,500. The Syndicate Bank&#13;
was able to provide these services and earn a profit because its costs for&#13;
lending to agriculture and small enterprises were less than a third of those&#13;
1/   This description is based on Bhatt (1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 116 -&#13;
incurred by the city banks and its administrative costs for deposit mobiliza-&#13;
tion were also much lower than those of the city banks.&#13;
Bhatt attributes the efficiency of the Syndicate Bank to "creative&#13;
adaptation of the banking technology to suit local conditions" (Bhatt, 1978,&#13;
p. 11). In particular, he cites the socio-economic background of the original&#13;
promoters of the Bank, the Bank's recruitment and promotion policies, the&#13;
provision of technical services to farmers and industrialists, the emphasis&#13;
on decentralized decision-making and a number of innovative deposit schemes&#13;
such as the Farmers' Protection Deposit Scheme and the Pigmy Deposit Scheme.&#13;
The deposit schemes are worth describing in more detail because&#13;
of their potential for duplication elsewhere. The guiding principle for&#13;
the Farmers' Protection Deposit Scheme was the recognition of a particular&#13;
motive for saving - crop insurance.    The deposit only pays interest at the&#13;
rate of five percent per annum; the depositor, however, was granted the right&#13;
to borrow up to twice the outstanding deposit at a rate of nine percent in&#13;
the event of crop failure.   The scheme demonstrated that operators of small&#13;
farms are prepared to save, even at low rates of interest, if, by doing so,&#13;
a major cause of concern can be eliminated or at least reduced.&#13;
The Pigmy Deposit Scheme illustrates the importance of reducing&#13;
transaction costs for the potential depositor.    The operation of this scheme&#13;
involved door-to-door collection by appointed agents of a given amount at&#13;
stated intervals. In this way, small amounts could be saved on a daily,&#13;
weekly or monthly basis without the need for frequent visits to the Bank.&#13;
The cost to the Bank proved lower than the costs of other types of deposit,&#13;
and Pigmy Deposits soon became an important part of total deposits.&#13;
Other successful programs have been based on cooperative associa-&#13;
tions.  The National Agricultural Cooperative Federation in Korea and the&#13;
Farmers Association in Taiwan are cases in point. Both institutions have&#13;
pursued high interest rate policies to attract savings and have provided a&#13;
variety of complementary services to borrowers in order to ensure full pro-&#13;
ductive use of investable resources.&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
The analysis suggests the following conclusions:&#13;
(i) the short-run impact on the demand for industrial labor&#13;
resulting from the elimination of nonprice rationing in&#13;
the formal capital market cannot be discerned from the&#13;
available evidence;&#13;
(ii) the impact on agricultural labor demand, however, will be&#13;
positive; and&#13;
(iii) the long-run impact resulting either from the elimination of&#13;
nonprice rationing or from reductions in transactions cost&#13;
is potentially significant, because savings are responsive&#13;
both to increases in GDP and improvements in financial&#13;
services.&#13;

Chapter 13: Synthesis&#13;
Much of Part III has stressed the dynamic consequences of improve-&#13;
ments in resource allocation. Except in the case of agriculture, it is&#13;
argued that the main benefit in terms of labor demand of a more efficient&#13;
allocation of resources arises, not from sectoral changes in the distribution&#13;
of a given quantity of investable resources, but from the dynamic ramifica-&#13;
tions of the resulting increased rate of capital accumulation. 1/ The con-&#13;
centration on allocational efficiency follows immediately from the delimi-&#13;
nation of the present exercise; 2/ the importance attached to dynamic conse-&#13;
quences, however, is a judgment based on the preceding analysis. 3/&#13;
As a partial test, this judgment can be confronted with the avail-&#13;
able evidence on the relationship between sectoral output and employment&#13;
growth. By definition, the employment elasticity equals the ratio of the&#13;
rates of growth in employment and output. If dynamic considerations prevail,&#13;
it can be expected that the intercountry correlation between employment and&#13;
output growth is high, while that between employment growth and the employ-&#13;
ment elasticity is low. In the limit, when all countries have the same&#13;
employment elasticity and employment growth is determined solely by output&#13;
growth, the correlation coefficient relating employment and output growth&#13;
would be unity while that relating employment growth and the employment&#13;
elasticity would be zero.&#13;
The significance of this test is increased if it is confined to a&#13;
group of countries at relatively similar stages of development but which have&#13;
adopted a variety of development strategies usually thought to have signifi-&#13;
cantly different implications for factor usage. Accordingly, attention is&#13;
focussed on fourteen semi-industrialized countries 4/ which, although all&#13;
in the middle-income range, have, nevertheless, used a variety of industrial&#13;
strategies ranging from import substitution in countries like Colombia and&#13;
Mexico to export promotion in countries like Korea and Taiwan. The same&#13;
group of countries also offer a wide range of experience with respect to&#13;
agricultural strategies embracing the bimodal approach of Colombia and&#13;
Mexico as well as the unimodal approach of Korea and Taiwan.&#13;
1/   This echoes the conclusion on improvements in the efficiency of labor&#13;
markets advanced in Part II.&#13;
2/   See Introduction and Conclusions.&#13;
3/   This judgment is apparently shared by the ILO.   Although one of the&#13;
premises of the World Employment Program is the observation that high&#13;
growth rates have not necessarily yielded correspondingly high rates&#13;
of employment growth, three of the recent comprehensive country reports&#13;
have recommended strategies which entail higher GDP growth rates than&#13;
those observed in the recent past (Thorbecke, 1973).&#13;
4/   The countries are Argentina, Colombia, Greece, Korea, Mexico, the&#13;
Philippines, Portugal Singapore, Spain, Taiwan, Tunisia, Turkey,&#13;
Uruguay and Yugoslavia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 118 -&#13;
The results are easily summarized. For industry the correlation&#13;
coefficient between employment and output growth is 0.79 while that between&#13;
employment growth and the employment elasticity is 0.24. For agriculture,&#13;
however, the results are reversed, the corresponding coefficients being 0.06&#13;
and 0.82. Although not conclusive, the results are consistent with the&#13;
argument that dynamic considerations prevail in the industrial sector,&#13;
whereas in agriculture variations in factor proportions associated with&#13;
static resource allocation predominate. 1/&#13;
1/   The test focuses on the relationship between employment and output, and&#13;
excludes other factor inputs. Nevertheless, if the relationship between&#13;
employment and output is similar among countries and yet production in&#13;
different countries is characterized by different factor intensities,&#13;
the difference must reflect variations in technical efficiency (i.e.,&#13;
the use of less of one or more inputs for a given level of output)&#13;
rather than variations in allocative efficiency or factor price ratios.&#13;

PART IV: POLICIES AFFECTING LABOR SUPPLY&#13;
The historical and cross-sectional analyses of Part I demonstrated&#13;
the marked differences.in population growth rates, levels of educational&#13;
attainment, and rates of expansion in educational facilities. The emergence&#13;
of high rates of unemployment among the educated was reviewed in Part II.&#13;
In the present section, the role of population and education policies in&#13;
determining the quantity and quality of the labor supply is assessed.&#13;
Chapter 14: Population Growth in Economic Development&#13;
It was demonstrated in Part I that population growth in today's&#13;
LDCs exceeds by a considerable margin the rates of growth experienced by&#13;
the DCs throughout their period of early industrialization. It was also&#13;
shown that growth rates in the 1960s varied among regions: Latin America&#13;
experienced the highest rates followed by Africa, Asia and, at a considerable&#13;
distance, the DCs of Europe and North America.&#13;
The Consequences of Rapid Population Growth 1/&#13;
The high fertility rates found in most LDCs imply "young" age&#13;
structures and increasing size of successive age cohorts, which in turn&#13;
imply that:&#13;
(a) a greater proportion of resources is required for feeding,&#13;
clothing and educating the young, thereby reducing the&#13;
availability of resources for productive investment;&#13;
(b) a greater proportion of investment is required to equip new&#13;
entrants to the labor force thereby limiting the extent to&#13;
which capital per worker can be increased; and 2/&#13;
(c) a larger stock of labor is applied to fixed factors, such&#13;
as land, resulting in diminishing returns.&#13;
Tables 51 through 53 substantiate these points by providing informa-&#13;
tion on the age structure of the population by region for 1975 (Table 51),&#13;
gross domestic investment per new labor market entrant for selected countries&#13;
in 1975 (Table 52), and the growth rates in crop area and agricultural popula-&#13;
tion for selected countries during the period 1970 to 1975 (Table 53). As&#13;
expected, Table 51 reveals sharp differences between the age structures of&#13;
the developed regions and the less developed regions, but within the latter&#13;
group differences are not marked. Table 52 provides some indication of the&#13;
variation in gross domestic investment per new entrant to the labor market:&#13;
1/   This section draws on King (1978).&#13;
2/   Growth of the labor force is essentially determined by the growth&#13;
and age structure of the population. See Part I and Stolnitz (1974).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 120 -&#13;
a rich country with a slowly-growing population such as France is able to&#13;
invest over US$250,000 in each new labor market entrant, whereas a poor&#13;
country with a faster growing population, such as Ethiopia, has little more&#13;
than US$1,000 available for each new worker. Much of this difference, how-&#13;
ever, must be attributed to variations in national income rather than in&#13;
population growth. The effect of rapid population growth on social invest-&#13;
ment may be more important. For example, Zymelman (1976) shows that although&#13;
a "typical" developing country spends the same proportion of GDP on primary&#13;
education as a "typical" OECD country, its enrollment rate is only half that&#13;
of the OECD country, not because unit costs expressed as a percentage of GNP&#13;
per capita are different, but because the proportion of school-age children&#13;
is twice as large in LDCs as in the OECD countries. Finally, Table 53 shows&#13;
that the increasing pressure of population on land is only apparent in coun-&#13;
tries such as Pakistan where population is growing rapidly and agriculture&#13;
remains the dominant sector.&#13;
Population Growth and GNP per Capita&#13;
It is generally concluded from the above arguments that higher&#13;
rates of population growth result in lower rates of growth in GNP per capita&#13;
than would otherwise be the case. For example, between 1965 and 1975, annual&#13;
growth in GNP in low-income Africa, low-income Asia, Western and Northern&#13;
Europe, and North America and Oceania was in the range 3.5 to 3.9 percent.&#13;
Growth in GNP per capita in the former two regions, however, was half that&#13;
achieved in the latter two regions because of differing population growth&#13;
rates. 1/&#13;
Despite this demonstration, however, most studies indicate no&#13;
obvious relationship between population and income per capita growth rates.&#13;
Easterlin (1967), Kuznets (1965) and Chesnais and Sauvy (1973) failed to find&#13;
any statistically significant relationship, whether positive or negative,&#13;
between population and income per capita growth in various samples of LDCs,&#13;
while Conlisk and Huddle (1969), Hanson (1973), and Thirlwall (1972) demon-&#13;
strate a slight positive relationship.&#13;
The absence of any simple negative correlation between population&#13;
and income per capita growth rates, however, is not altogether surprising.&#13;
Population growth is only one of the many factors which affect the rate of&#13;
increase of income per capita. 2/ Clearly, a more complex model, incorpo-&#13;
rating both demographic and economic factors, is required. A number of such&#13;
models exist; they are consistent in demonstrating that moderate population&#13;
growth rates (1.5 percent) produce higher rates of growth in per capita income&#13;
than high population growth rates (2.5 percent). 3/&#13;

An alternative approach involves the use of standard cost-benefit&#13;
techniques to estimate the social net worth of family planning programs.&#13;
The conceptual difficulties of measuring the social benefit of one less&#13;
birth, as well as the empirical difficulties of predicting the reduction&#13;
in births effected by any given program, have limited the application of&#13;
this approach. The available studies, however, suggest acceptable rates of&#13;
return. 1/&#13;
Family planning programs may also be justified on the grounds that&#13;
they reduce market imperfections and offset divergences between the private&#13;
and social cost of children. Available evidence indicates that couples in LDCs&#13;
1/   "Suggest" is used rather than "show" or "demonstrate" because most&#13;
studies are hypothetical; that is, they calculate the maximum quantity&#13;
of resources which could be allocated to family planning and at the&#13;
same time leave welfare (GNP or GNP per capita) unchanged despite a&#13;
given reduction in fertility. See Simon (1970) and Demeny (1965).&#13;

are unaware of contraceptive alternatives and consequently choose inferior&#13;
contraceptive methods. The high incidence of abortion in some countries&#13;
also suggests that family planning programs can improve the efficiency of&#13;
the "market" by increasing the flow of contraceptive information. Important&#13;
externalities may also arise if, for example, lifetime public sector expendi-&#13;
ture on health, education and other social services exceeds the taxes paid&#13;
by an additional child and his immediate family. Imperfect information and&#13;
externalities, therefore, provide a rationale for the public provision of&#13;
family planning services.&#13;
Population Growth, Structure of the Labor Force, and Wage Rates&#13;
It is also possible to obtain some indication of the effect of&#13;
population growth on selected labor market variables, such as the rate of&#13;
transformation in the industrial structure of the labor force and the rate&#13;
of change in real wages. Unfortunately, because of data inadequacies; the&#13;
statistical models which have been used for this purpose are not always&#13;
based on a complete specification of the labor market. For example, if the&#13;
market is competitive the appropriate reduced form equation has the wage&#13;
rate as the dependent variable. Serious weaknesses in wage rate data have&#13;
led most researchers to estimate employment rather than wage functions. On&#13;
some occasions this is justified by reference to institutionally-determined&#13;
wages in the modern sector, so that employment is demand-determined. In&#13;
this event, however, the wage should appear as an independent variable but&#13;
again this is not usually attempted. In addition, most available studies&#13;
focus on the relative size of the manufacturing labor force as a function&#13;
of the absolute size of the total population, rather than on growth rates&#13;
and are not, therefore, directly relevant. 1/&#13;
The most useful study (Oberai, 1978) for the present purpose&#13;
regresses the percentage change in the share of modern sector employment 2/&#13;
between 1960 and 1970 on:&#13;
(a) the period rate of growth of GDP between 1960 and 1970;&#13;
(b) the share of modern sector employment in 1960; and&#13;
(c) the period rate of growth of the labor force between&#13;
1960 and 1970.&#13;
The results have a very simple interpretation; if the labor force increases&#13;
at 3 percent, the share of modern sector employment in the total labor force&#13;
decreases by 1 percent, and the share of the labor force in other sectors&#13;

(1975,b).&#13;

and unemployment increases by 4 percent. 1/ It may be concluded that rapid&#13;
population growth retards the transformation of the industrial structure of&#13;
the labor force.&#13;
A similar study (Gregory and Lal, 1977) demonstrates the dampening&#13;
influence of labor force growth on the rate of increase of real wages. They&#13;
show that for a sample of 22 countries the elasticity of the rate of growth&#13;
in real wages with respect to labor force growth is approximately minus one.&#13;
The available evidence, therefore, indicates quite clearly that&#13;
population growth has significant implications for employment and wage rates.&#13;
It is often pointed out, however, that even a major reduction in fertility&#13;
cannot be expected to have any impact on the growth of the labor force for&#13;
,at least 15 years. For short-term policy-making the labor force can be&#13;
treated as independent of population growth. For example, Stolintz (1974)&#13;
notes that even if LDC fertility rates had been halved in 1975, the male&#13;
labor force would have been only one-eighth smaller in 2000 than it otherwise&#13;
would have been. The same reduction in fertility, however, would have halved&#13;
the male work force under age 25 by 2000, and it is precisely this group&#13;
which has suffered most from unemployment. Although it is true that changes&#13;
in fertility do not affect short-run labor supply to any significant extent, 2/&#13;
for the various reasons advanced above family planning programs should remain&#13;
a crucial element of long-term policy-making.&#13;
The Scope for Policy Intervention&#13;
Having demonstrated the significance of population growth, the&#13;
next step is to investigate the scope for policy intervention. Two approaches&#13;
are adopted. First, a general assessment of the significance of family&#13;
planning programs in reducing fertility is provided using the results of&#13;
international, econometric studies. Second, a more detailed assessment&#13;
of different types of programs is undertaken for a selection of countries.&#13;
Most of the available econometric studies confirm the importance&#13;
of a variety of social, developmental and cultural factors in determining&#13;
fertility; generally, however, some measure of the strength of the family&#13;
planning program is also found to be significant. 3/ The results of only&#13;
1/   The estimated equation is:&#13;
M     =  38.22 + 0.061Y - 0.658S -0.257L    R   =  0.59&#13;
(1.76)   (4.93)   (2.20)&#13;
where M = percentage change in modern sector employment; Y = growth&#13;
rate of GDP; S = initial share of modern sector employment; and L =&#13;
growth rate of labor force.&#13;
2/   A reduction in fertility may in fact increase female labor force parti-&#13;
cipation in the short-run (Standing, 1978,a).&#13;
3/   For reviews of the literature see Mauldin and Berelson (1977) and&#13;
Faruqee (1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 126 -&#13;
one study (Mauldin and Berelson, 1977) are reported here but it may be con-&#13;
sidered representative of the more comprehensive and qualitatively-superior&#13;
exercises.&#13;
With a sample of ninety-four developing countries, Mauldin and&#13;
Berelson attempt to explain the change in crude birth rates 1/ between 1965&#13;
and 1975 in terms of demand for family limitation and supply of fertility&#13;
control methods. On the demand side, the authors consider measures of "social&#13;
setting" and cultural factors. The former, which includes adult literacy,&#13;
primary and secondary school enrollment, life expectancy, infant mortality,&#13;
the share of the male labor force in nonagricultural activities, GDP per&#13;
capita, and the degree of urbanization, may be viewed as an index of modern-&#13;
ization. The latter includes such cultural factors as the position of women&#13;
in society and the dominant religio-cultural tradition (e.g., Catholic, Black&#13;
African, Chinese). And on the supply side, an index of program effort is&#13;
devised based on policy statements (interpreted as an indication of commit-&#13;
ment), the availability and quality of family planning services and advice,&#13;
the use of mass media, the budget support from the government and so on.&#13;
The results are easily recorded: the explained variance in the&#13;
decline in the crude birth rate is increased by 26 percent if the index of&#13;
program effort is added to the "social setting" variables, and by 12 percent&#13;
if it is added to the "social setting"-variables and the cultural factors.&#13;
Program effort is thus seen to be an important additional factor in reducing&#13;
fertility. 2/&#13;
Mauldin and Berelson also provide a useful cross tabulation of&#13;
"social setting" or modernization against program effort. Their results are&#13;
reported in Table 54. The tabulation reveals very clearly that large declines&#13;
in the crude birth rate are strongly associated with substantial program&#13;
effort, whereas high "social setting" is associated with only modest declines,&#13;
unless linked to a strong program effort. "Countries with both significant&#13;
program effort and high social setting enjoyed a CBR decline of some 30%,&#13;
those with only significant program effort a decline of about 20%, those&#13;
with high social setting alone a drop of 5%, and those with neither saw no&#13;
change in their CBR during the ten-year period. If the past record can be&#13;
extrapolated to the future, a country which wished to reduce its CBR sub-&#13;
stantially would be well advised to institute a family planning program of&#13;
at least moderate strength. Given the existence of a moderate program effort,&#13;
improving social setting takes precedence, but planning to rely only on&#13;
enhancing social setting would appear to result in a relatively slow decrease&#13;
in CBR" (Mauldin and Berelson, 1977, p. 75).&#13;
1/   According to Mauldin and Berelson the use of the superior total fertility&#13;
rate as a measure of fertility would not change their results because&#13;
of the very high correlation (0.97) between the crude birth and the&#13;
total fertility rates.&#13;
2/   Multicolinearity poses a severe problem for the interpretation of&#13;
results in virtually all the studies investigating fertility decline.&#13;

The geographical dispersion of family planning efforts emerges very&#13;
clearly from Table 54: Africa, for example, offers little in the way of&#13;
family planning services; with the important exceptions of India and Sri Lanka,&#13;
the same is true of South Asia; Latin America exhibits considerable variation&#13;
ranging from very strong programs in countries like Jamaica and Costa Rica to&#13;
relatively weak ones in Mexico and Venezuela; throughout most of Southeast&#13;
Asia, however, programs are characterized as strong or moderate.&#13;
Family planning programs can take a variety of forms, ranging from&#13;
policies of persuasion (for example, promotion of small families), through&#13;
price policies (for example, subsidized contraceptive supplies) to policies&#13;
of coercion (such as, raising the minimum legal age for marriage). l/ Most&#13;
programs concentrate on providing information about contraception and supply-&#13;
ing contraceptive services including sterilization at or below market cost.&#13;
The allocation of funds to family planning programs for a selection of coun-&#13;
tries is shown in Table 55. Annual expenditure per capita exceeds US$1 in&#13;
only one country, Mauritius, and is generally less than 20 US cents. Govern-&#13;
ment expenditure on family planning is usually less than 0.2 percent of total&#13;
government expenditure (India, Indonesia and the Philippines are notable&#13;
exceptions) and less than 5.0 percent of expenditure on health (Indonesia, the&#13;
Philippines, Taiwan, Iran and Korea being some of the important exceptions). 2/&#13;
Few programs have relied on coercive measures or tax incentives. In&#13;
China and India attempts have been made to increase the minimum age of marriage&#13;
but the effectiveness of these policies, especially in rural areas, and their&#13;
ultimate impact on fertility remain uncertain. The most important coercive&#13;
policy, the prohibition of abortion, serves to increase fertility; liberaliz-&#13;
ing laws, however, have been enacted during the late 1960s and early 1970s in&#13;
India, Korea, Singapore, Tunisia, Turkey and Zambia. With regard to tax incen-&#13;
tives, Singapore and the Philippines have eliminated or reduced benefits&#13;
accruing to larger families, India has sterilization and nonpregnancy bonuses&#13;
and Taiwan has experimented with educational benefits for smaller families.&#13;
Apart from the Indian sterilization campaign in Gujarat and Ernakulem, which&#13;
was highly successful, it is too early to evaluate the other programs.     Perhaps&#13;
the most significant achievement, however, belongs to Indonesia. Besides&#13;
demonstrating that low-income, underdeveloped countries can successfully&#13;
reduce fertility, the Indonesian example also illustrates the importance of&#13;
community involvement at the village level.&#13;
Evidence on both the potential benefits and the feasibility of&#13;
fertility reductions constitutes a convincing argument in favor of extending&#13;
and improving family planning programs especially in the low-income countries&#13;
which are presently experiencing high rates of population growth. Failure to&#13;
do so would constitute a major error of policy formulation, with significant&#13;
consequences for long-run development.&#13;

Chapter 15: Education Policy 1/&#13;
The Role of Education in Economic Growth&#13;
Numerous studies have documented the statistical relationship be-&#13;
tween some measure of educational attainment and national income per capita.&#13;
For example, Harbison and Myers (1964) report a high correlation (0.89)&#13;
between their composite index of human resource development and GDP per&#13;
capita. 2/ These and similar exercises, however, fail to prove causality;&#13;
educational expansion may be a result of economic growth rather than vice&#13;
versa. Nevertheless, such exercises cannot be completely dismissed: Peaslee&#13;
(1967), for example, drawing on historical and contemporary data, shows that&#13;
sustained economic growth was not achieved in his sample of countries until&#13;
10 percent of the population was enrolled in primary school. Similarly, in a&#13;
detailed study of Latin American development, Ramos (1970) demonstrates that&#13;
the rapid growth in manufacturing output during the period 1960 to 1970,&#13;
although not associated with a rapid growth in manufacturing employment,&#13;
was based on significant improvements in the quality of the labor force. In&#13;
particular, he shows an absolute fall in employment in manufacturing based&#13;
on traditional skills, a relative fall in those sectors relying mainly on&#13;
unskilled labor and a strong relative and absolute rise in employment in&#13;
the skill-intensive subsectors of modern manufacturing. His argument is&#13;
completed by reference to the rapid improvements in the educational attain-&#13;
ments of the Latin American labor force occurring during that and earlier&#13;
periods.&#13;
Apart from macro analysis, the significance of education can also&#13;
be demonstrated at the micro level by an examination of earnings differentials.&#13;
Table 56 reveals that discounted lifetime earnings increase rapidly with edu-&#13;
cational attainment especially in the LDCs. The differentials reported here,&#13;
however, are calculated on the basis of contemporary cross-sectional data and&#13;
do not, therefore, adequately measure potential or expected earnings unless&#13;
it is assumed that labor market conditions remain unchanged. Nevertheless,&#13;
for current purposes the data are adequate: earnings of the educated exceed&#13;
those of the uneducated. 3/&#13;
Measures of earnings differentials, however, are only part of the&#13;
story: costs of education are also relevant. It is more appropriate, there-&#13;
fore, to focus on the social rate of return to education. Table 57 summarizes&#13;
1/   The discussion here is confined to the central issues of overexpansion&#13;
of educational facilities and educated unemployment. A variety of other&#13;
issues, such as the content of curricula, are discussed in World Bank&#13;
(1978,d).&#13;
2/   The composite index is the weighted sum of enrollment rates at the&#13;
secondary and tertiary levels.&#13;
3/   This is the almost universal conclusion emerging from estimates of&#13;
earnings functions. See, for example, Mazumdar and Ahmed (1978) and&#13;
Psacharopoulos (1977).&#13;

the evidence on rates of return by educational level for a selection of coun-&#13;
tries. The individual studies on which this table is based vary in quality&#13;
and method so that the reported figures should only be interpreted as crude&#13;
indications of the social net worth of education. 1/ Nevertheless, it is&#13;
probably safe to conclude that rates of return in the developing countries&#13;
decline with the level of education 2/ but exceed those reported for secondary&#13;
and higher education in developed countries.&#13;
Educational Expansion and its Implications&#13;
The natural consequence of these and similar demonstrations of the&#13;
link between education and economic growth was the rapid expansion in educa-&#13;
tional facilities and output described in Part I. An unforeseen consequence,&#13;
however, was the emergence of high rates of unemployment among those with&#13;
primary and secondary education, indicating a situation of excess supply. A&#13;
rough measure of the imbalance between the demand and supply of educated&#13;
labor, the ratio of modern sector job vacancies to labor market entrants&#13;
with secondary or higher education, is reported in Table 58. The table may&#13;
be interpreted as follows: if modern sector employment grows at 5 percent,&#13;
job vacancies, including those arising from deaths and retirement, would&#13;
amount to, for example, 50 percent of the new labor market entrants with&#13;
secondary or higher education in the Philippines, 142 percent in Senegal,&#13;
and 446 percent in Kuwait. Of course, not all secondary school-leavers will&#13;
necessarily seek modern sector jobs; on the other hand, primary school-leavers&#13;
can be expected to fill some modern sector vacancies. The ratio should be&#13;
interpreted, therefore, as only roughly indicative of the gap between job&#13;
aspirations and opportunities.&#13;
The crucial determinants of this gap are the size of the modern&#13;
sector and its rate of growth, population growth (which determines age struc-&#13;
ture) and the enrollment rate. The high rates of unemployment for secondary&#13;
school-leavers in Sri Lanka and the Philippines reported in Table 20 are not&#13;
surprising in view of the relative imbalance between demand and supply&#13;
suggested by the very low values of the ratio shown in Table 58. Countries&#13;
like Kuwait, on the other hand, can be expected to experience shortages of&#13;
educated workers because of the exceptional growth of the modern sector at a&#13;
time when the educational sector is still relatively underdeveloped. Although&#13;
not so extreme, Brazil faces a similar situation. Intermediate values of the&#13;
ratio are recorded for Korea where modern sector employment is growing rapidly&#13;
and the educational system is well-developed.&#13;
1/   The studies are described in detail in Psachoropoulos (1973).&#13;
2/   For this, and other reasons, it is often argued that primary education&#13;
should be expanded relative to secondary and higher education. See&#13;
Blaug (1973). This may well be the case for certain countries, but,&#13;
as is argued below, past rate-of-return calculations are not appro-&#13;
priate indicators of the future social profitability of education.&#13;

1/   The accommodation ratio is the number of modern sector job vacancies&#13;
expressed as proportion of the number of labor market entrants with&#13;
secondary or higher education. The modern sector includes all&#13;
professional, technical, administrative and managerial workers, all&#13;
salaried employees and wage earners in nonagriculture and 50 percent&#13;
of employers and workers on own account in clerical jobs. Vacancies&#13;
depend on deaths and retirement rates and economic growth assumed to&#13;
be 2 percent, 5 percent or 8 percent.&#13;

The analysis suggests that the problem of educated unemployment&#13;
may be attributed at least in part to the recent high population growth&#13;
rates and the simultaneous desire to increase enrollment rates. As a result,&#13;
the educational structure of the labor force has undergone a very rapid&#13;
transformation. Labor markets have adjusted - wage differentials have nar-&#13;
rowed and some revision of expectations has occurred - but not sufficiently.&#13;
This suggests that neither Table 57 nor Table 58 is an adequate base from&#13;
which to draw policy conclusions. The appropriate procedure is to recognize&#13;
that adjustments are occurring, albeit slowly, in the labor market and to&#13;
reconsider the estimation of social rates of return to education.&#13;
As noted earlier, rate-of-return calculations which fail to allow&#13;
for rapidly-changing labor market conditions may prove seriously misleading.&#13;
Equating expected earnings differentials with existing differentials, and then&#13;
proceeding to recommend nonmarginal expansions in educational facilities is&#13;
not legitimate. 1/ Illegitimate analysis, however, does not necessarily&#13;
lead to incorrect policy conclusions:   ex post social rates of return&#13;
may well be lower than ex ante rates but still higher than any reasonable&#13;
measure of the opportunity cost of capital. Unfortunately, the lack of&#13;
ex post rate-of-return estimates prevents a judgment on the extent, if any,&#13;
of overexpansion.&#13;
Nevertheless, the policy advice is clear: future rate-of-return&#13;
calculations should allow for the narrowing of wage differentials usually&#13;
associated with economic development 2/ and for the possibility of unem-&#13;
ployment. The advice points to the need for careful and continuous review&#13;
of labor market developments and tendencies, and may well imply some reduc-&#13;
tion in the rate of expansion of educational facilities especially at the&#13;
secondary level.&#13;
Social and Private Rates of Return&#13;
Because education is usually highly subsidized private rates of&#13;
return generally exceed the corresponding social rates. The data in Table&#13;
59 show that the private rate for primary education is 8 percentage points,&#13;
for secondary education 4 percentage points and for higher education 10&#13;
percentage points above their respective social rates. It follows that if&#13;
educational facilities are expanded at a socially optimal rate, and the&#13;
social and private opportunity costs of capital are similar, the private&#13;
demand for education will exceed public supply even if education is not&#13;
regarded as a consumption good.&#13;
1/   Allowances for unemployment, and segmented labor markets have been&#13;
made in a number of studies. See, for example, Selowsky (1973) and&#13;
Pinera and Selowsky (1978).&#13;
2/   Evidence on this point is documented in Gunter (1964) and Taira&#13;
(1966).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 136 -&#13;
Of course, some of the demand will be satisfied by private&#13;
institutions but, provided the private rate of return exceeds the social&#13;
rate in public schools, excess demand for public school places will continue.&#13;
A solution frequently recommended is to make students or their parents bear&#13;
a higher proportion of the costs of education by charging tuition or other&#13;
fees in order to reduce, if not eliminate, the gap between private and social&#13;
rates of return. 1/ A gradual increase in tuition fees, or the introduction&#13;
of a system of student loans to be repaid after graduation, would seem par-&#13;
ticularly appropriate at secondary and higher levels, where the cost of&#13;
education, as shown in Table 60, is many times higher than at the primary&#13;
level. 2/ Moreover, in the past those proceeding to secondary and higher&#13;
education have come mainly from the richer groups in society; a system of&#13;
tuition fees, rather than heavy subsidies from general taxation, would benefit&#13;
both income distribution and resource allocation. The pursuit of equity would&#13;
be further served by the provision of free education or even scholarships for&#13;
able students from low-income families, and by improvements in both the quality&#13;
and coverage of primary education.&#13;
The above recommendation, however, may encounter a number of diffi-&#13;
culties: tuition fees are unpopular; social and private rates of return can&#13;
still diverge because of externalities and imperfect information; full-cost&#13;
pricing may fail to eliminate excess demand if education is perceived as a&#13;
consumption good. It may be expected, therefore, that even if tuition fees&#13;
are adopted to some extent in some countries, most will still experience&#13;
conditions of excess demand for secondary education. Consequently, nonprice&#13;
rationing will remain an important feature of educational systems for many&#13;
years to come.&#13;

Vocational and On-the-Job Training I/&#13;
Educated unemployment may also reflect an inappropriate combination&#13;
of academic and vocational instruction; the skills supplied by the education&#13;
system may not match the skills demanded by industry. The appropriate role&#13;
of vocational training, however, is a controversial issue.. Although the&#13;
acquisition of industrial skills is an essential component in the transfor-&#13;
mation and upgrading of the labor force, the most useful institutional arrange-&#13;
ment for imparting these skills remains unclear. Nevertheless, experience in&#13;
several countries provides a number of useful guiding principles. Blaug&#13;
(1973), for example, argues that given the difficulty, if not impossibility,&#13;
of predicting the future demand for highly specific skills, vocational&#13;
training in formal institutions "makes little sense on either educational&#13;
or on economic grounds" (Blaug, 1973, p. 71). After reviewing a number of&#13;
informal vocational training establishments, however, Zymelman (1976) con-&#13;
cludes that in some circumstances such training may be socially beneficial.&#13;
The most important feature of a successful training program is a&#13;
direct link with the labor market; unless vocational training establishments&#13;
are responsive to changing labor market conditions, their graduates will&#13;
encounter difficulty in finding employment and the investment in training&#13;
will prove socially unproductive. In the apprenticeship schemes of West&#13;
and East Africa, for example, the link between the labor market and the&#13;
training facilities is provided in the person of the master craftsman.&#13;
Nigeria, for instance, has more than two million adolescents and young&#13;
workers apprenticed to traditional and modern craftsmen as weavers, black-&#13;
smiths, carpenters, printers and mechanics. This system proves useful in&#13;
imparting certain types of skills but is clearly limited by the existing&#13;
knowledge of the master craftsmen. Where rapid transformation of the&#13;
economy is occurring, the indigeneous apprenticeship system is unlikely to&#13;
be an adequate means of skill acquisition.&#13;
The alleged externalities of training and the economies of scale&#13;
associated with training have led to a number of public sector attempts to&#13;
provide vocational instruction through the formal education system. The&#13;
Secondary Technical Schools in Kenya, for example, provide courses in English,&#13;
Mathematics, Science, Geography, Technical Drawing and either Basic Engineer-&#13;
ing or Basic Building Technology and Applications. Approximately equal&#13;
shares of time are devoted to academic and technical subjects. A follow-up&#13;
study of the 1974 graduates, however, indicated that in mid-1975 almost 60&#13;
percent were unemployed.&#13;
A similar situation is observed in Thailand, where the Comprehen-&#13;
sive Schools offer a mixture of academic and vocational training at the&#13;
secondary school level. The academic training is designed to equip students&#13;
for further education, while the vocational training provides skills for&#13;
those seeking immediate employment. Few students (about 15 percent), however,&#13;
select the vocational subjects and the provided equipment and facilities&#13;
remain seriously underutilized. The Trade and Industry Schools are more&#13;
1/   This section draws on Zymelman (1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 139 -&#13;
explicitly concerned with the training of skilled workers for industry but&#13;
also provide some general education. As a result, the schools are often&#13;
used as a device by students either to return to the academic stream or else&#13;
to obtain a white-collar job. The ability of graduates to obtain industrial&#13;
employment is also questionable; only a small percentage obtain employment&#13;
in the private sector.&#13;
In both Kenya and Thailand, the creation of skills occurs primarily&#13;
through on-the-job training in private industry. The failure of the vocational&#13;
schools is generally attributed to their inability to adapt to changing labor&#13;
market conditions, which, in turn, is a consequence of the inflexible admin-&#13;
istration usually associated with formal education. 1/&#13;
Other countries have deliberately sought to encourage on-the-job&#13;
training and make vocational training institutions responsive to the labor&#13;
market. The Industrial Training Board (ITB) in Singapore, for example, was&#13;
established outside the formal education system with the express purpose of&#13;
promoting and coordinating industrial training within a highly flexible and&#13;
responsive framework. The ITB is an autonomous body with members drawn from&#13;
government, the trade unions and industry. The Board relies on the advice&#13;
of eight trade-specific committees and offers a variety of training courses.&#13;
The needs of employers are of central concern. For example, the Day Release&#13;
Course only accepts nominees of employers, and part-time trainees in the skill&#13;
upgrading program must also have the endorsement of their employers. Employers&#13;
can also choose from a selection of schemes which combine formal instruction&#13;
and on-the-job training in different proportions. The Board also supervises&#13;
the Joint Government-Industrial Training Scheme and the Industrial Training&#13;
Grants Scheme, both of which are designed to encourage industry's participa-&#13;
tion in training programs, either in conjunction with the government or&#13;
independently through the provision of grants.&#13;
Responsiveness to the needs of private industry is also apparent&#13;
in Brazil's National Service for Industrial Apprenticeship (SENAI). Estab-&#13;
lished by the government in 1964, SENAI is a private, non-profit organization.&#13;
It is administered by the National Confederation of Industry and provides a&#13;
variety of training programs. Of interest, however, is its reliance on&#13;
periodic surveys of the labor market designed to provide the basis for fore-&#13;
casting the quantitative and qualitative needs of business. This is followed&#13;
by careful job analyses which seek to identify the technical requirements of&#13;
specific jobs. In this manner, the supply of skilled labor is tailored to the&#13;
future needs of industry. The 1 percent payroll tax used to finance the&#13;
scheme also serves as an incentive to employers to undertake their own&#13;
on-the-job training programs, since employers who do so are exempted from&#13;
payments.&#13;
1/   This is not a necessary characteristic of formal education.     The World&#13;
Bank-supported technical schools in Korea have proved highly successful&#13;
in establishing strong links with the labor market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 140 -&#13;
Generalizing on the basis of such a small sample is always&#13;
hazardous. Nevertheless, the available evidence suggest that vocational&#13;
training can be conducted successfully provided it is not embedded in the&#13;
inflexible administration usually found in the formal education system.&#13;
The two successful programs - ITB in Singapore and SENAI in Brazil - differ&#13;
in terms of specifics but are similar in their determination to involve&#13;
the business community in the training process and in their efforts to&#13;
monitor, and respond to, changing labor market conditions.&#13;
Chapter 16: Conclusion&#13;
Much of the discussion has focussed on the implications for the&#13;
labor force of two major developments of the last twenty years -- rapid&#13;
population growth and a major expansion in educational facilities. The&#13;
former has retarded the rate of transformation in the industrial structure&#13;
of the labor force, while the latter has advanced that in the educational&#13;
structure of the labor force. Whether the rates of transformation are too&#13;
slow in the one case or too fast in the other will remain a matter of contro-&#13;
versy. The consequences of the underlying developments are nevertheless&#13;
highly visible in the LDCs: large numbers remaining in low productivity&#13;
agriculture and high rates of educated unemployment. Although such outcomes&#13;
are obviously dependent on the interaction of demand and supply within an&#13;
imperfectly operating labor market, it may be argued that factors operating&#13;
on the supply side of the equation must shoulder a major portion of the&#13;
blame for the employment problems encountered in most LDCs.&#13;

            Labor force employment and labor markets in
            the course of economic development
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Low rates of industrial employment
            growth, high rates of unemployment for new entrants to the
            labor market and low levels of labor productivity and
            remuneration are the three issues addressed in this paper.
            It is demonstrated that the sectoral transformation of the
            labor force in developing countries has been retarded in
            comparison with historical experience, not by unusually slow
            expansion in industrial employment, but by unusually fast
            labor force growth. The concentration of high rates of
            unemployment among young, inexperienced but first-time
            entrants to the urban labor market is attributed to the
            varying rates at which wages in different segments of the
            market have adjusted to the unprecedented expansion in the
            supply of such workers, and to the ability of relatively
            rich families to support their dependents during a period of
            job-search. Low productivity and remuneration are attributed
            primarily to inappropriate macroeconomic policies.
            Accordingly, much of the policy discussion is concerned with
            the identification of the more important determinants of
            labor demand and supply and the extent to which the
            development of the former has been restrained, and that of
            the latter advanced, by inappropriate or inadequate policies.
