Credit and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower      Republic of Yemen (ROY)&#13;
Beneficiaries   Ministry of Construction, Housing and Urban Planning (MOC), and&#13;
Civil Aviation and Meteorological Authority (CAMA)&#13;
Amount         SDR24.7 million (US$37.0 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms          Standard with 40-year maturity and 10 years grace&#13;
Commitment:  0.5 percent on undisbursed credit balances, beginning 60 days after signing, less any&#13;
Fees          waiver&#13;
Project     : The project's primary objective is to undertake urgent rehabilitation needs in the&#13;
Description    roads and civil aviation sectors; it also seeks to improve the capacity for road&#13;
maintenance, and to develop appropriate civil aviation policy. The proposed project&#13;
would rehabilitate two badly deteriorated road sections, and reconstruct the terminal&#13;
building and construct a new control tower at the Aden International Airport (AIA)&#13;
which were damaged during the war. The road sector component (Part-A) of the&#13;
project includes: rehabilitation of the Hodeidah-Salif (65 Iam) road leading to the&#13;
deepwater port at Salif, and the Am Ayn-Naqabah (100 Iam) section of the Aden -&#13;
Mukalla road; establishment of a Road Maintenance Fund (RMF), and through a newly&#13;
established Yemen Road Fund Board (YRFB), introduction of systematic maintenance&#13;
planning and budgeting for the main road network. The civil aviation component (Part-&#13;
B) of the project includes: reconstruction and replacement of all services (air&#13;
conditioning, passenger information systems, etc.) of the AIA terminal which suffered&#13;
bomb damage during the war in 1994; construction of a control tower; and a Civil&#13;
Aviation Policy Study to identify options for developing the institutions in the civil&#13;
aviation sector.&#13;
Benefits    : The project benefits include: restoration of the Aden International Airport, thereby&#13;
contributing to safety and to re-establishing Aden as a center for trade and commerce;&#13;
reducing vehicle operating costs on the road sections rehabilitated, for which the&#13;
economic rate of return is estimated to be about 40 percent; and securing the&#13;
maintenance of the main road network through creation of an assured source of funding&#13;
based on road user charges, and of the necessary institutional capacity for effective&#13;
maintenance. The project also improves the macro-economic situation by reducing the&#13;
burden on the general budget imposed by road maintenance which will be funded&#13;
through user charges.&#13;
Risks       : Since the project is for emergency reconstruction, its design has been kept simple in&#13;
order to minimize implementation delays. A majority of the procurement is effected&#13;
through four large ICB contracts. Potential delays in the implementation of the Road&#13;
Maintenance Fund is addressed by making enactment of legislation to establish the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ii&#13;
Fund and the Yemen Road Fund Board a condition of Board presentation. Delays in&#13;
obtaining financing for the AIA control tower equipment is addressed by making&#13;
confirmation of this financing by December 31, 1996 a requirement in the Credit&#13;
Agreement.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN&#13;
TRANSPORT REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   The proposed Transport Rehabilitation Project in the Republic of Yemen (ROY), is designed to&#13;
address needs in the country's transport sector arising both out of the damages suffered in the recent civil war&#13;
(May-June, 1994), and from neglect of road maintenance which now necessitates reconstruction of sections&#13;
of the road network. War related emergency reconstruction works to be financed under the project are,&#13;
reconstruction of the terminal building and replacement of the control tower at the Aden International Airport,&#13;
which were badly damaged in the fighting; the terminal building took a direct hit and has not been in use&#13;
since the war. Road rehabilitation works to be financed under the project include two road sections: a 100-&#13;
km section of the Shukra-Am Ayn-Naqaba road between Aden and Mukalla which is the main link to the&#13;
eastern parts of the country; and the Hodeidah-Salif Road which links the new deepwater port of Salif on the&#13;
Red Sea coast to the main road network and to the city of Hodeidah.&#13;
1.2   Since the road rehabilitation works to be financed under the Credit have been necessitated by&#13;
inadequate maintenance performance in the road sector, the project includes components to assist the&#13;
Government in strengthening the road maintenance function in the country. To this end, the project will&#13;
assist in the establishment of a Road Maintenance Fund with revenues generated from road user charges, and&#13;
in putting in place a maintenance planning, budgeting and contracting capability which, in conjunction with&#13;
an assured source of funding, would remove the primary obstacles to effective maintenance of the road&#13;
network.&#13;
A.    Country Background&#13;
1.3   The Republic of Yemen occupies an area of about 530,000 sq. km. of largely mountainous and&#13;
desertic terrain in the southwestern part of the Arabian Peninsula. Of a total population of about 16 million&#13;
(1995), about 12 million are concentrated in the northern governorates which cover less than a third of the&#13;
land area. There are five distinct geographic regions: the coastal plain along the Red Sea (the Tihama Plain);&#13;
the Indian Ocean desertic littoral, with its strategic centers of population such as Aden; the rugged central&#13;
and southern highlands, rising to about 2500 m., where the bulk of the population lives; the eastern plateau;&#13;
and the Rub Al Khali desert. Only about 3 percent of the land is arable, mainly in the central and southern&#13;
highlands where rainfall is highest, in the Tihama plain, and in the wadis (river valleys) of the eastern&#13;
plateau.&#13;
1.4   Though the overall output of the Yemeni economy has improved recently, the country still faces a&#13;
difficult situation. Following a slump in economic activity after the Gulf War, GDP rebounded in 1992.&#13;
Growth accelerated in 1993 and 1994, averaging 5.8 percent, primarily due to rapidly expanding oil&#13;
production, which increased by 19 and 56 percent in 1993 and 1994. This growth however did not benefit&#13;
all segments of the population; unemployment which had averaged 25-30 percent during 1990-93 is estimated&#13;
to have risen further in 1994. With a population of about 14 million, per capita GNP is estimated at US$280,&#13;
or well below the IDA eligibility cut-off. The country's economic difficulties stem from both internal and&#13;
external factors. Internally, unification caused substantial increases in Government expenditures which could&#13;
not be covered by non-inflationary means, and also weakened the Government's ability to implement policies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
to deal with a deteriorating macro-economic situation. Externally, the Gulf crisis led to a drop in financial&#13;
inflows - both aid and private remittances, and to a large increase in the labor force, due to the return of&#13;
Yemeni workers from Gulf countries. The civil war in 1994 only worsened an already difficult situation.&#13;
1.5   The Government's preoccupation with the unification process and the hiatus caused by the hostilities&#13;
in 1994, overshadowed efforts to halt the deterioration in public finances. The budget deficit remained very&#13;
large, at over 18 percent of GDP in 1992 and 1993, and increased to an estimated 21.5 percent in 1994. The&#13;
deficit has customarily been financed through external borrowing and through domestic bank financing.&#13;
External financing has declined and now amounts to only 1.5 percent of GDP, and in the absence of a well&#13;
developed market for treasury instruments, deficit financing was largely in the form of money creation. As&#13;
a result, the parallel market exchange rate for the Yemeni Rial (YR) rapidly depreciated; by March 1995,&#13;
while the official rate was YR12/$, it was trading at YR142/$ on the parallel market. Following devaluation&#13;
of the official rate to YR50/$ in April 1995, the parallel market rate depreciated a bit further to YR150/$.&#13;
1.6   IDA's Country Assistance Strategy for Yemen, being presented to the Board along with this project,&#13;
has the following main objectives: (i) support stabilization, structural reforms and social protection measures;&#13;
(ii) improve portfolio implementation and the sustainability of past and future investments; and (iii) promote&#13;
sustainable natural and human resources development. This project supports and is fully consistent with the&#13;
proposed IDA assistance strategy: it would restore key economic infrastructure while improving the&#13;
sustainability of transport sector investments by funding maintenance through a system of user charges. It&#13;
would also promote macro-economic stabilization by reducing the burden on the Government's budget of&#13;
financing road maintenance, the costs of which will now be recovered from road users.&#13;
B.    IDA Sector Role and Strategy&#13;
1.7   Since 1970, IDA has contributed to the development of ROY's transport system and institutions&#13;
through one port and seven highway projects in the former YAR; and an engineering credit, one port and&#13;
six highway projects in the former PDRY. In addition, the Multi-Mode Transport Project (Credit 2177-&#13;
YEM) which was approved in 1990 after the creation of the unified ROY supported construction of roads,&#13;
and technical assistance and equipment for the aviation and ports sectors. The first seven highway projects&#13;
in the north (Credits 315-YAR, 558-YAR, 794-YAR, 1267-YAR, 1413-YAR, 1726-YAR and 1848-YAR),&#13;
and the engineering credit and the first seven highway projects in the south (Credits 512-YDR, 240-YDR,&#13;
560-YDR, 1144-YDR, 1295-YDR, 1617-YDR and 1823-YDR) have been completed.&#13;
1.8   Previous IDA highway projects in the north and south, assisted in the establishment and consolidation&#13;
of highway agencies. Two public sector construction units were also established to implement road works&#13;
due to a lack of domestic capacity in the road construction sector. A Vocational Training Ceniter was also&#13;
established under the Third Highway Project in Taiz, as a training facility for all road maintenance staff. In&#13;
addition, IDA credits assisted in the preparation of a Highway Master Plan (February 1986), and a Transport&#13;
Sector Study (June 1984) which have helped define investment and institutional needs.&#13;
1.9   The two completed port projects, have also achieved important physical targets, and the PCR/PPAR&#13;
No. 5465 for the port project in the north (Credit 714-YAR) found that the project was instrumental in&#13;
expanding port capacity significantly. Similarly, the PCR/PPAR No. 5982 for the Aden Port Rehabilitation&#13;
Project in the south (Credit 584-YDR) acknowledges that the project helped to cope with an unforeseen&#13;
increase in port traffic in the late 1970's and early 1980's; however, changes in shipping patterns following&#13;
the closure of the Suez Canal, and later, competition from other Red Sea ports caused Aden to lose much of&#13;
its business in bunkering and ship services. Manpower training in the ports and civil aviation sectors are&#13;
being addressed under the ongoing Multi-Mode Transport Project (Credit 2177-YEM).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
1.10   Since Yemen's primary road network is approaching completion, IDA's transport sector strategy&#13;
focusses on: maintenance of existing assets (as in the present project); selective expansion of the road network&#13;
providing access to areas with high economic potential; and the upgrading of operational and financial&#13;
management. A study now being initiated under a Project Preparation Facility seeks to prioritize maintenance&#13;
and rehabilitation needs of the existing road network, and the present project addresses some of the more&#13;
pressing institutional and financial needs affecting maintenance of the road network.(')&#13;
1.11   The experience with project implementation in Yemen has been mixed, but since the civil war the&#13;
remaining project in the sector (Multi-mode Transport project) has been performing well. The monthly&#13;
progress of physical works is acceptable, the project is disbursing well, no extension of the closing date seems&#13;
necessary at this stage, and there are no problems with the Special Account and Audit Reporting. This is&#13;
mainly due to simplicity in project design and straightforward procurement arrangements. The present project&#13;
has therefore been designed accordingly with most of the procurement to be accomplished through four large&#13;
civil works contracts. Credit covenants have also been designed so that implementation of otherwise&#13;
independent project components is not disrupted by defaults on covenants relating to other components.&#13;
II. SECTORAL BACKGROUND&#13;
2.1    Yemen's transport sector, like most other parts of the economy, is presently comprised of a mix of&#13;
the systems which existed in the former PDRY and YAR prior to unification. In the south, the sector was&#13;
dominated by centralized planning and public enterprises, while in the north, more traditional forms of&#13;
organization have been the norm, with numerous anachronistic practices and distortions. Since unification&#13;
the country as a whole has been moving toward more liberalized, market economy based forms of&#13;
organization, and this is true in the transport sector also.&#13;
A.    The Road Sector&#13;
2.2    Over the decade 1980-90, the paved road network in Yemen grew rapidly from about 2,900 kms. to&#13;
4,900 kms, and in early 1993, the length of the paved network, including projects under construction stood&#13;
at 5,734 luns. Average daily traffic volumes range from around 10,000 ADT (near Sana'a) to just under&#13;
1,000 ADT on most of the network, with traffic volumes in the north generally exceeding 2,000 ADT, while&#13;
in the south most roads carry less than 2,000 ADT with a few exceptions near Aden and in the Hadramout&#13;
valley. Since unification of the country in 1990, traffic growth rates have been around 8 percent per annum,&#13;
reflecting increases in the vehicle fleet resulting from the large numbers of vehicles brought into the country&#13;
by the returnees after the Gulf crisis, and also increases in trade and transport among various parts of the&#13;
newly unified country. Rapid expansion of the road network, which essentially, doubled in the last 15 years,&#13;
has caused maintenance of existing roads to be neglected, and deteriorating roads now cause large economic&#13;
losses through increased vehicle operating costs, as well as for reconstruction of roads which have&#13;
deteriorated to the point of structural failure. Rehabilitation and maintenance of the road network has,&#13;
therefore, become an urgent priority in the sector.&#13;
2.3    Key issues in the sector include inadequate funding of road maintenance, low cost recovery,&#13;
overloading of trucks and high axle loads, and institutional weaknesses in planning. The issues and&#13;
As part of the assistance strategy, IDA has also prepared and negotiated the Safir-Hadramout Road&#13;
Project supporting a 300 km expansion of the road network to provide better communications between&#13;
north-Yemen and the former south (Hadramout). The project is pending confirmation of cofinancing. The&#13;
road component of the Transport Rehabilitation Project includes various institutional and transport policy&#13;
changes which were agreed during negotiations of the Safir-Hadramout Road Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
recommnended policy actions are described in Annex 1 and are summarized in Table 2.1 below. In order to&#13;
improve cost recovery and maintenance funding, a Road Maintenance Fund is proposed to be set up financed&#13;
by a road user surcharge on fuel, and other user charges such as heavy vehicle license fees (see Annex 2).&#13;
Administration of the RMF will be by the newly established Yemen Road Fund Board which will be&#13;
responsible for planning and administering road maintenance expenditures, and legislation for the&#13;
establishment of the RMF and YRFB has been developed and has been reviewed by IDA. Terms of Reference&#13;
for technical assistance to be provided to the YRFB for putting in place appropriate planning and control&#13;
systems have been developed and were agreed at negotiations. A Letter of Road Sector Strategy and Policy&#13;
setting out the Government's policy in the sector has also been provided to IDA (Annex 3).&#13;

B.      Civil Aviation&#13;
2.4     As in the case of the roads sector, the civil aviation sector comprises a mix of systems that existed,&#13;
prior to unification of the country, in the Civil Aviation Department (CAD) of the former PDRY, and in the&#13;
Civil Aviation and Meteorological Authority (CAMA) of the former YAR. The scope of operations, assets&#13;
and organization of the present CAMA, which absorbed CAD at unification, have undergone radical changes&#13;
first as a result of unification (1990), more recently due to the Gulf crisis (1991), and finally due to the civil&#13;
war (May-June, 1994) in which considerable damage was suffered at the Aden International Airport.&#13;
2.5     Following unification in 1990, CAMA became responsible for the combined airspace of the unified&#13;
country, and given the vast geographical extent of the former PDRY, this was a considerable expansion in&#13;
the airspace controlled by CAMA. It also absorbed a large number of staff of the former CAD whose policy&#13;
had been to carry out most works using its own staff, whereas CAMA relied to a far greater extent on&#13;
contracting. CAMA also acquired from CAD a completely different mix of equipment, mnuch of it supplied&#13;
from eastern bloc sources, which caused difficulties in obtaining spares, inter-operability and maintenance.&#13;
The Gulf crisis in 1991 precipitated another major change; up until then Saudi Arabia had been supporting&#13;
all air traffic services in the northern Governorates, and controlling the upper airspace from Jeddah. When&#13;
relations with Saudi Arabia deteriorated during the Gulf crisis, the Saudis withdrew support, and the entire&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
S&#13;
responsibility, and financial burden, of managing the airspace fell on CAMA. The most recent crisis, further&#13;
strained CAMA due to the large losses of equipment and facilities suffered at AIA which had become the&#13;
primary base for air traffic services following the withdrawal of Saudi assistance. These events have resulted&#13;
in a considerably weakened sector significantly compromising civil aviation safety in the country. The Civil&#13;
Aviation National Plan-2005 (CANP-2005), prepared by international consultants under European Union&#13;
assistance in 1992 (prior to the most recent crisis), had identified numerous critical deficiencies in the sector,&#13;
and the losses suffered in the civil war have now exacerbated what was already a difficult situation. CANP-&#13;
2005 undertook an extensive assessment of past air traffic trends and prospects for the future, for the 5&#13;
international and 14 domestic airports in the country. Table 2.2 below summarizes the traffic estimates&#13;
presented in CANP-2005, with the exception of the data for 1993 and 1994 which were provided by CAMA.&#13;
Forecasts made in CANP-2005 expect the relative shares of the major airports to remain relatively stable,&#13;
with Aden registering a slightly higher growth rate and doubling its passenger traffic to almost 500,000&#13;
passengers by the year 2005. Whereas over the next ten years, passenger traffic in the country as a whole&#13;
is projected to grow at between 4 and 5 percent per annum, Aden's traffic is projected to grow at between&#13;
5 and 6 percent per annum.&#13;

2.6    CAMA is an autonomous agency, under the Minister of Transport. Its ten-member Board of&#13;
Directors includes senior managers of CAMA, one representative each from the Ministry of Transport and&#13;
the Air Force, and the Chairman of the national airline. The Chairman of CAMA also has executive&#13;
responsibility for running CAMA. The Board functions largely as a management committee rather than a&#13;
body which exercises oversight over management. CAMA's present organization structure, financial&#13;
condition and operations are described in greater detail in Annex 4. Key issues facing CAMA are discussed&#13;
briefly below, and a more detailed discussion is in the Annex.&#13;
2.7   The most critical issues facing CAMA at present are a lack of trained manpower and their extremely&#13;
weak financial situation. The organization expects to lose many senior staff in the next five years when the&#13;
staff occupying senior positions retire. Low civil service salaries makes it difficult to recruit and retain&#13;
qualified personnel. An experienced CAMA technician earns a third to one half the salary of a similarly&#13;
qualified technician working for the national airline, which has a special arrangement allowing much higher&#13;
salary scales. CAMA also loses trained technicians to the oil companies working in Yemen, who have a need&#13;
for trained electronics technicians. CAMA's two training institutes at Sana'a and Aden, once considered a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
possible regional training site are now barely functional. CAMA's financial condition is precarious, and&#13;
presently its revenues barely suffice to pay for salaries and the agency is dependent on Government subsidies&#13;
to cover a bare minimum of operating expenses. It is dependent on donor/Government funding for all its&#13;
development expenditures, and even items such as spare parts and paint for marking runways often need to&#13;
be funded by donors. The reasons for CAMA's weak financial condition include:&#13;
(a)    Low tariffs - a revision of CAMA's tariffs is now under consideration, however, even with&#13;
the tariff increase CAMA revenues will recover only two thirds of its expenditures (see Annex 4);&#13;
(b)    Overstaffing primarily due to the absorption of large numbers of CAD staff;&#13;
(c)    Non-payment or delayed payment by the national carriers who now owe CAMA the&#13;
equivalent of a year's worth of CAMA revenues; and&#13;
(d)    Loss of significant overflight revenues due to inadequacies in billing and financial systems.&#13;
CAMA's income statements for FY93, FY94, and estimates/projections for the years 1995, 2000, 2005 are&#13;
in Annex 4. Projections are made for two scenarios - retaining present tariffs and with the increased tariff&#13;
now under consideration - and show that even with the increased tariff, CAMA continues to make losses.&#13;
2.8   In view of the present incomplete understanding of the constraints and options the civil aviation sector&#13;
faces from an institutional development standpoint, it is advisable that, as a first step, an institutional&#13;
development strategy and policy study be undertaken and TORs for such a study have been agreed with IDA.&#13;
The study would review the current situation, identify options and recommend a course of action with regard&#13;
to a number of policy areas such as the role of the private sector, organizational structure, tariff setting and&#13;
financing, responsibility for negotiating bilateral air transport agreements, staffing and training, remuneration,&#13;
etc., all of which crucially impact on the ability to deliver safe and cost-effective air transport services,&#13;
without burdening the government with having to finance large deficits in CAMA's budget. The principles&#13;
which would guide the development of Civil Aviation policy have been discussed and are set out in a Letter&#13;
of Civil Aviation Policy from the Government to IDA (Annex 5).&#13;
III. THE PROJECT&#13;
3.1   In selecting the components of the proposed Transport Rehabilitation Project, Government has given&#13;
priority to those which result in the greatest reduction in economic losses, i.e., road rehabilitation and&#13;
terminal reconstruction at AIA, and to those which affect safety, e.g., the control tower and communications&#13;
and navigation equipment for AIA.&#13;
A.    Project Objectives&#13;
3.2    The project's primary objective is to rehabilitate critical components of the country's road and civil&#13;
aviation infrastructure; secondarily, the project seeks to improve institutional capacity in these sectors for&#13;
planning and maintenance of existing assets.&#13;
B.    Project Description&#13;
3.3    As the project involves two separate implementing agencies it has been sub-divided in two parts, one&#13;
for each agency, each to be implemented independently of the other. The following summarizes the main&#13;
components and a more detailed description is provided in Annex 6.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
3.4   Part A: Ministry of Construction. Housing &amp; Urban Plng. (MOC) would implement the following:&#13;
(1)   Hodeidah-Salif, 65 km Road Rehabilitation (US$10.3 million)(2).&#13;
(2)    Am Ayn-Naqabah, 100 km Road Rehabilitation (US$10.0 million).&#13;
(3)    Equipment, Software and Training for Maintenance Planning (US$2.0 million).&#13;
(4)    Assistance to the newly created Yemen Road Fund Board (US$0.74 million).&#13;
(5)    Study for Planning &amp; Prioritizing Road Maintenance Needs and Detailed Design for&#13;
Rehabilitation of key highway links (US$1.5 million).&#13;
(6)   Implementation and Construction Supervision Consultants (US$1.5 million).&#13;
A Project Implementation Unit, supported by supervision consultants, would be established within the&#13;
Ministry of Construction, Housing and Urban Planning to oversee Part-A of the project. This Project&#13;
Implementation Unit will also oversee the establishment and initial operation of the Road Maintenance Fund&#13;
and the Yemen Road Fund Board.&#13;
3.5   Part B: Civil Aviation and Meteorological Authority (CAMA) would implement the following:&#13;
(1)    Aden International Airport Terminal Reconstruction (US$7.0 million).&#13;
(2)    New Control Tower and Technical Building at AIA (US$6.0 million).&#13;
(3)   Communications/Navaids Equipment (US$5.0 million).&#13;
(4)    Safety Equipment (US$1.0 million).&#13;
(5)    Civil Aviation Strategy and Policy Study (US$0.5 million).&#13;
(6)   Implementation, Design and Construction Supervision (US$1.5 million).&#13;
A Project Implementation Unit, supported by the designed and construction supervision consultants, would&#13;
be established at CAMA headquarters in Sana'a to oversee all components under Part B of the project.&#13;
C.    Cost Estimate&#13;
3.6   The project cost estimate is prr sented in Table 3.1, and is based on the following:&#13;
(a)    The quantities of the road pavement layers are defined by the length and width of the road&#13;
and are not subject to inaccuracies. The payments to the contractor are based on theoretical&#13;
quantities, and since the pavement cost in road rehabilitation contracts is almost 50 percent or more&#13;
of the total cost of the project, a phvsical contingencv of only 5 percent is considered adequate.&#13;
2/  These are total base costs including the Goverment's contribution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
(b)    Since the reconstruction costs of the AIA terminal is based on a cost estimate (prepared by&#13;
the consultants who did the original design) without detailed engineering, a higher physical&#13;
contingency of 10 percent has been assumed for the ALA civil works.&#13;
(c)    For estimating the price contingency, a three-year implementation for road works and a two-&#13;
year implementation for airport civil works, has been assumed.&#13;
A price escalation of 2.4 percent per year were discussed and agreed during project preparation.&#13;

D.    Financing Plan&#13;
3.7   The Ministry of Planning indicated that a GOY contribution of US$3.0 million for the Aden&#13;
International Airport component was feasible using the general development budget over a three-year&#13;
period. This would amount to 20 percent of the civil works costs. For the Road Component the&#13;
Government would provide another US$6.8 million over the two to three year implementation period&#13;
for the road works. IDA contribution would be limited to an amount in US$ equivalent to 70&#13;
percent of the costs of the road rehabilitation projects. The Ministry of Planning indicated that the&#13;
Government of France has expressed interest in financing US$5.0 million equivalent for the&#13;
Communications and Navaids Equipment and confirmation of this or another source of financing for&#13;
this equipment is to be provided by December 31, 1996. An IDA Credit of US$37.00 million&#13;
equivalent would complete the financing needed as shown in Table 3.2.&#13;

E.    Project Implementation&#13;
3.8   Independent Project Implemen;tion Units, at MOC and CAMA, will oversee implementation of Part-&#13;
A and Part-B of the project, respectively. The civil works under Part-A would be carried out under two&#13;
separate contracts, one for each of the two roads. The bidding for the road works will take place as soon&#13;
as the supervision consultant, who would be responsible for supervising both contracts, has been appointed.&#13;
For Part-B, the bidding documents for the control tower and the technical buildings are ready and would be&#13;
bid as a package in one contract as soon as the design and supervision consultant has been appointed and has&#13;
reviewed the bid documents. The appointed firm will also be assigned the design work and supervision for&#13;
reconstruction of the terminal building, and as soon as the documents are ready, the terminal building&#13;
reconstruction work can be bid, about 4 months after the first contract for construction of the control tower&#13;
has been awarded. An implementation and procurement plan for the project is in Annex 6.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
3.9    Design and Bidding Documents.   Detailed design of the road projects has been completed and&#13;
bidding documents have been completed by international consultants. The design is, however, based on&#13;
relatively old data on the state of road deterioration on the two roads. For this reason and in order to reduce&#13;
costs, the supervision consultant would have to review the design and update it before construction works&#13;
start. The bidding documents will also be adjusted to comply with the Bank's guidelines for procurement&#13;
of works, with minor deviations/adjustments as follows:&#13;
(a)    The contract would be denominated in US$ or another currency widely used in international&#13;
trade, and for the road contracts the Government would pay 30 percent of the contract price in local&#13;
currency using the market rate of exchange 28 days prior to bid opening, foreign contractors may&#13;
choose to be paid in a currency other than the US$ at a fixed rate of exchange to the US$.&#13;
(b)    The road contracts would provide for price adjustment for bitumen, steel and cement using&#13;
international price indices for these materials. For fuel, the price adjustment would be based on&#13;
actual price adjustments by the Government in the prices of fuel in Yemen.&#13;
(b)    The price adjustment formula would not include changes in the costs of international inputs;&#13;
however, since most equipment costs would be incurred at an early stage in the contract, and the&#13;
contracts are denominated in US$, international escalation would be relatively predictable, and the&#13;
lack of escalation for international labor and equipment would not represent an unmanageable risk&#13;
to contractors.&#13;
3.10   Detailed design and bidding documents for the construction of the technical building and control tower&#13;
for the Aden International Airport have recently been prepared by an international consultant. The documents&#13;
assume the contract would be denominated in US$, with 20 percent of the contract price payable in Yemeni&#13;
Rials at the market rate of exchange, and include price adjustment provisions for all materials and local labor.&#13;
The Government has agreed that minor adjustments would be made to the documents by the supervision&#13;
consultant before tendering to make them fully conform with the Bank's guidelines for procurement of works.&#13;
3.11   The reconstruction works needed for the terminal building have been surveyed by the international&#13;
consulting firm which prepared the original design, and a detailed cost estimate has been prepared. This&#13;
includes rehabilitation of the terminal building, replacement of all fittings such as doors and windows, all&#13;
partitioning, false ceilings, insulations, air-conditioning, electrical equipment, restaurants, furnishings, and&#13;
repair of roof and replacements of facade elements. Similarly, replacement of all of the special equipment&#13;
such as check-in counters with scales, conveyor belt on the departure side, telephone system, flight&#13;
information display, public address system, etc. has been costed. The design and tender documents have not&#13;
been prepared yet, and this would be undertaken by the same supervision consultant engaged for the control&#13;
tower/technical building who would also supervise the terminal rehabilitation. The bidding of this consultancy&#13;
will be undertaken shortly, and shortlisting of consultants is now in progress.&#13;
F.    Procurement&#13;
3.12   The project components, their estimated costs, and the procurement arrangements for the elements&#13;
to be financed by IDA are summarized in Table 3.3. IDA would finance the civil works, procurement of&#13;
safety equipment, design reviews and construction supervision, and other technical assistance elements of the&#13;
project. The IDA-financed civil works and equipment would be procured under the Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits. Consulting services financed under the Credit, would be&#13;
procured in accordance with the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the&#13;
Bank as Executing Agency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
3.13   All civil works contracts would be awarded using ICB procedures, and procurement documentation&#13;
and decisions relating to all civil works contracts would be subject to prior review and approval by IDA.&#13;
Pre-qualification of contractors would be carried out for all civil works contracts of the project. Contracts&#13;
for equipment and materials, not exceeding US$200,000 each, would be procured through international&#13;
shopping procedures based on the comparison of three price quotations from at least two countries. The total&#13;
aggregate value of such contracts would not exceed US$1.0 million. All contracts exceeding US$200,000&#13;
would be subject to prior review and approval by IDA. For consultancy assignments financed by IDA under&#13;
the project, there would be prior review for contracts worth $100,000 and above for contracts with consulting&#13;
firms and $50,000 and above in the case of contracts with individual consultants. This would result in prior&#13;
review of about 90 percent of IDA-financed procurement. During Credit negotiations, agreement would be&#13;
reached with the Government on the above procurement arrangements and those set out in Table 3.3.&#13;

G.    Disbursements and Audit&#13;
3.14   The proposed IDA Credit would be disbursed against the project components as shown in Table 3.4.&#13;
Withdrawal applications for contracts valued at more than US$200,000 would be fully documented and&#13;
presented in English for disbursements. Disbursement for contracts valued at US$200,000 or less would be&#13;
made on the basis of statements of expenditure (SOEs). Agreement has been reached with the Government&#13;
that documentation to support expenditures financed under SOEs or otherwise will be maintained, in English,&#13;
by MOC and CAMA. and made available for review by IDA supervision missions, and annual audit reports&#13;
of Project Accounts and SOEs will be prepared and submitted in English. by auditors acceptable to IDA&#13;
within six months of the end of each fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
3.15   Special Accounts. To facilitate disbursements on smaller contracts, a portion of IDA's share of the&#13;
project could be disbursed through two Special Accounts which would be opened at the Central Bank of&#13;
Yemen by MOC &amp; CAMA, respectively. In the past, utilization of Special Accounts has been extremely low,&#13;
and the substantial funds tied up in Special Accounts has been a source of concern. Therefore, the authorized&#13;
allocation for each Special Account would be US$0.5 million, equivalent to about four months of project&#13;
expenses, other than for the main civil works contracts, financed under the IDA Credit. Replenishment of&#13;
the Special Accounts would follow IDA procedures. The Special Accounts would be audited annually by&#13;
independent auditors acceptable to IDA. The audit report, in English, would be submitted to IDA for review&#13;
and approval within six months of the end of each fiscal year. During negotiations, agreement would be&#13;
reached on the operation and auditing of the Special Accounts.&#13;

3.17   Disbursement Schedule. A schedule of disbursements, based on a projected effectiveness date in&#13;
June 1996, is given in Annex 7. It is anticipated that the proposed project will be completed in about 66&#13;
months, including a 12 months contractor's maintenance period, from the date of approval by IDA or by&#13;
December 31, 2001, and the Closing Date is set for June 30, 2002. Due to the relatively uncomplicated&#13;
nature of the works to be financed, the estimated disbursement schedule is shorter than the standard&#13;
disbursement profile for transport sector projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
H.    Project Supervision and Monitoring&#13;
3.18   Supervision requirements for the project are shown in Table 3.5. Over the project execution period&#13;
this would amount to 12 missions, with one large project inception mission initially, to launch the project.&#13;
Project supervision would be based on an agreed set of Project Monitoring and Development Impact&#13;
indicators which are presented in Annex 8. The new Resident Mission in Yemen is expected to play an&#13;
important role in supervising the project, and about a third of overall supervision inputs will be provided by&#13;
staff stationed in the field, who will follow up procurement and implementation progress and assist the&#13;
Government in conforming with IDA guidelines and procedures.&#13;

I.    Environmental Aspects&#13;
3.19   Since the project involves only rehabilitation and maintenance of: (i) existing roads in their original&#13;
alignments without significant widening; and (ii) reconstruction of the AIA terminal and replacement of the&#13;
control tower, no significant environmental impacts are anticipated. The project is, therefore, rated as an&#13;
environmental category - B investment. The Environmental Analysis including a table of proposed mitigation&#13;
plans are in Annex 9.&#13;
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
4.1    This section presents the economic evaluation of the road rehabilitation components (US$28.52&#13;
million) of the project. The two road sections to be rehabilitated, Hodeidah-Salif (65 kms) and the Am Ayn-&#13;
Naqabah Road (100 Iam) are in extremely poor condition and require reconstruction over a large portion of&#13;
their lengths and strengthening (overlays) of the remainder. Sections of the first road have failed so badly&#13;
that vehicles can average only 25 to 30 kmph, as compared with normal highway speeds of 80 to 90&#13;
kmnph. For the economic evaluation, tbfr Hodeidah-Salif section was divided into two segments: (a) a 7 km&#13;
segment that requires strengthening with minor widening and (b) a 58 km segment that requires&#13;
reconstruction. Similarly, the Am Ayn-Naqabah section was also divided into two segments: (a) a 40 km&#13;
segment that requires reconstruction and (b) a 60 km segment which requires an overlay (strengthening). The&#13;
results for each segment were combined to form the economic evaluation of each section and for the overall&#13;
project. The details of these evaluations are presented in Annex 10.&#13;
4.2    Reconstruction of the bomb damaged terminal building at Aden International Airport (US$8.03&#13;
million) has not been subjected to an economic evaluation since this is an unavoidable expenditure for repair&#13;
of war damage, and the benefits of this expenditure are expected to be high as it will restore the use of this&#13;
expensive terminal facility. Construction of the control tower for the airport (US$6.89 million) is also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
necessary because the old (and inadequate) tower was damaged in the war and much of the equipment was&#13;
lost; a condition for bilateral financing of the equipment is that the Government provide the necessary&#13;
buildings and civil structures, and by providing these the project enables the airport to acquire the equipment&#13;
needed to restore the safety and efficiency of air traffic control operations. Since it is difficult to quantify&#13;
the benefits of constructing the new tower, no economic evaluation has been carried out for this component.&#13;
Also, the terminal building works consists of the reconstruction of an existing structure while the control&#13;
tower works are dictated by minimum safety standards both of which allow little flexibility in adjusting the&#13;
scope of the project. The economic evaluation presented below, therefore pertains to the road rehabilitation&#13;
components only.&#13;
A.    Evaluation Methodology for the Road Component&#13;
4.3    The Highway Design and Maintenance Standards Model (HDM-III) developed by the World Bank&#13;
was utilized to evaluate the road components of the project. HDM simulates the behavior of a road pavement&#13;
under given traffic loads, maintenance strategies and rehabilitation options. It also assesses the costs of&#13;
operating various classes of vehicles over the road as the condition of the pavement changes. By evaluating&#13;
the road's condition and vehicle operating costs with and without the proposed rehabilitation measures, it is&#13;
able to assess the benefits of the rehabilitation. Key elements of such an exercise are assessments of traffic&#13;
volumes, existing and projected, for various classes of vehicles, modelling vehicle operating costs and&#13;
modelling road deterioration.&#13;
4.4    Traffic Projections. Table 1 of Annex 10 presents traffic projections for the two road sections for&#13;
a period of 20 years. Traffic growth rates estimated for the 100 km Am Ayn-Naqabah section is 6 percent&#13;
annually, and the section now carries 1200 vehicles per day on average. The projected growth rate is based&#13;
on observed growth rates for traffic on other sections of the Aden - Mukalla road. On the Hodeidah-Salif&#13;
road, traffic is expected to grow at a high rate owing to the construction of the new deepwater port at Salif,&#13;
and the growth rate on this section is projected at 8 percent per annum for the first 10 years, and at 5 percent&#13;
subsequently; presently the road carries about 660 vehicles per day on average.&#13;
4.5    Vehicle Operating Costs. For the with project and without project cases, vehicle operating costs&#13;
(per vehicle-kl) were computed, using the HDM-III model, for five classes of vehicles as a function of the&#13;
road geometry, vehicle characteristics and the yearly roughness estimated using HDM-III (see Annex 10,&#13;
Table 3). These unit vehicle operating costs were used to compute the benefits derived from rehabilitation&#13;
of the road.&#13;
4.6    Road Deterioration. For each road segment, the yearly road deterioration (roughness) with the&#13;
project and without the project was estimated using HDM-III as a function of the estimated traffic, loading,&#13;
environment and construction characteristics (see Annex 10, Tables 4A, 4B, 4C and 4D). The HDM-III&#13;
model was also used to define the optimal maintenance strategy (operation and timing) after the completion&#13;
of construction, e.g., an overlay in yeir 2009.&#13;
4.7    Both construction costs and vehicle operating costs were converted to economic costs by eliminating&#13;
taxes, duties and subsidies. The distortion due to the difference between the official and parallel market&#13;
exchange rates was eliminated by expressing the unit vehicle operating costs in dollar terms, and by also&#13;
computing the project costs (construction and future maintenance) in dollars terms (see Annex 10, Table 2).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
4.8    Benefits. The benefits were obtained by multiplying the traffic by the vehicle operating cost savings,&#13;
and comparing the with and without the project cases. It should be noted that no passenger time saving&#13;
benefits were counted and therefore the benefits estimates are conservative. Annex 10, Tables 4A to 4D&#13;
present the calculation of benefits for each segment, and Table 5A presents the calculation of benefits for each&#13;
section, i.e., consolidates the regment evaluations to give the overall evaluation of the road section.&#13;
B.    Econonmic Evaluation and Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
4.9    The economic evaluation and the sensitivity analysis is shown in Annex 10, Tables 5A to 5D. and&#13;
the results are summarized in Table 4.1 below. The expected rate of return for the project is 39.5 percent,&#13;
and the sensitivity analysis shows that even with a combined 20 percent increase in costs and a 20 percent&#13;
decrease in benefits the economic rate of return for the rehabilitation works is estimated to be 28.8 percent.&#13;

4.10   In addition, a switching value analysis was carried out on key parameters: the cost of construction&#13;
and the level of traffic. As may be expected for a project with high rates of return, the switching values,&#13;
where the NPV turns negative, were found to be high. In the case of construction costs, it was found that&#13;
costs would need to increase by a factor of 3.2 to 4.5 (differs by road section) before the project exhibits&#13;
negative NPV at a 12 percent discount r-te. Similarly, traffic volumes would need to reduce to between 0.23&#13;
to 0.35 of projected levels before the NPV turned negative.&#13;
C.    Project Risks&#13;
4.11   Since the project is for emergency reconstruction, its design has been kept simple in order to&#13;
minimize implementation delays. A majority of the procurement is effected through four large ICB contracts.&#13;
Potential delays in the implementation of the Road Maintenance Fund is addressed by making Cabinet&#13;
approval of legislation to establish the Fund and the Yemen Road Fund Board a condition of Board&#13;
presentation. Potential delays in obtaining financing for the AIA control tower equipment is a risk, and if&#13;
financing for this is not confirmed by France by December 31, 1996, the Government has agreed to seek&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
alternative sources of grant financing or to provide the funds needed from its own resources. Since the type&#13;
of equipment required can be financed through a number of supplier credits, the risk of delay on this account&#13;
is relatively small.&#13;
V. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
5.1    At negotiations, agreement was reached on the following:&#13;
(a)    Prior to disbursements for any civil works under Part-A of the project, GOY will appoint the&#13;
Supervision consultants for the road components of the project (para. 3.8).&#13;
(b)    Prior to disbursements for civil works and equipment under Part-B of the project, GOY will take&#13;
following actions:&#13;
(i)    Select and appoint the Design and Supervision consultants for the reconstruction of the&#13;
terminal and construction of the control tower at Aden International Airport (para. 3.8); and&#13;
(ii)   Implement tariff increase proposed by CAMA (para. 2.7).&#13;
(c)    During implementation of the project, GOY will ensure that:&#13;
(i)    The three weigh-bridges at Hodeidah, Mokha and Harad will be put into operation, and axle&#13;
load controls will be implemented at each location in a manner satisfactory to IDA by&#13;
December 31, 1996 (para. 2.3 and Annex 1);&#13;
(ii)   All revenue from road user charges, including fuel surcharge initially set at YR 0.5/litre on&#13;
petrol, will be collected and deposited in a Road Maintenance Fund (para. 2.3 and Annex 2);&#13;
(iii)   The program of actions set out in the Letter of Road Sector Development Policies and&#13;
Actions (para. 2.3 and Annex 3) and the Letter of Civil Aviation Policy (para. 2.8 and Annex&#13;
5) will be carried out;&#13;
(iv)   Financing of at least US$5.0 million equivalent for control tower equipment at Aden&#13;
International Airport would be made available by December 31, 1996 (para. 3.7); and&#13;
(v)    Consultants to support the Yemen Road Fund Board and to carry out the Study for Planning&#13;
and Prioritizing Road Maintenance Needs (paras.2.3 and 3.4) will be appointed by December&#13;
31, 1996.&#13;
Based on the above agreements, the proposed project would provide a suitable basis for an IDA Credit to the&#13;
Republic of Yemen of SDR24.7 million (US$37.0 million equivalent) with a 40-year maturity including a 10-&#13;
year grace period, and a service charge of 0.75 of one percent on the outstanding amount.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN&#13;
TRANSPORT REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
The Road Sector&#13;
1.    Over the decade 1980-90, the paved road network in Yemen grew rapidly from about 2,900 kms to&#13;
4,900 kms, and in early 1993, the length of the paved network, including projects under construction stood&#13;
at 5,734 kms. Average daily traffic volumes range from around 10,000 ADT (near Sana'a) to just under&#13;
1,000 ADT on most of the network, with traffic volumes in the north generally exceeding 2,000 ADT, while&#13;
in the south most roads carry less than 2,000 ADT with a few exceptions near Aden and in the Hadramout&#13;
valley. Since unification of the country in 1990, traffic growth rates have been around 8 percent per annum,&#13;
reflecting the increases in the vehicle fleet resulting from the large numbers of vehicles brought into the&#13;
country by the returnees after the Gulf crisis, and also the increases in trade and transport among various&#13;
parts of the newly unified country. Rapid expansion of the road network, which essentially, doubled in the&#13;
last 15 years, has caused maintenance of existing roads to be neglected, and deteriorating roads now cause&#13;
large economic losses through increased vehicle operating costs, as well as for reconstruction of roads which&#13;
have deteriorated to the point of structural failure. Rehabilitation and maintenance of the road network has,&#13;
therefore, become an urgent priority in the sector.&#13;
A.    Performance of Road Transport&#13;
2.    Available data indicates that road freight transport is growing rapidly since unification of the country&#13;
in 1990, with total goods vehicle-km increasing from 5.2 billion in 1991 to over 5.6 billion in 1992. In&#13;
passenger transport the picture is mixed - passenger car vehicle-km increased from 4.4 billion in 1991 to 4.7&#13;
billion in 1992, but the output of buses, which are operated by the state-owned General Transport&#13;
Corporation, has grown only moderately from about 69 million vehicle-km in 1991 to 72 million vehicle-km&#13;
in 1992. The growth rates implied by these figures for goods movements and for passenger cars are large&#13;
(in the range of 8 to 9% per annum); the former relates to unification of the country and the consequent&#13;
increases in transport demand due to trade between the northern and southern governorates, while the latter&#13;
appears to be the effect of the returnees from the Gulf countries bringing with them large numbers of&#13;
personal vehicles.&#13;
3.    Average daily traffic (ADT) volumes range from around 10,000 ADT (near Sana'a) to just under&#13;
1,000 ADT on most of the paved road network, with traffic volumes in the north generally exceeding 2,000&#13;
ADT, while in the south most roads carry less than 2,000 ADT with a few exceptions near Aden and in the&#13;
Hadramout Valley. In 1992, the vehicle fleet is believed to have consisted of about 186,000 cars, 2,500&#13;
buses, and 252,000 goods vehicles. Vehicle utilization rates appear to be low particularly for trucks and&#13;
buses, and the average annual distance travelled is considerably below full utilization rates: for trucks&#13;
average annual distance driven is abou* 22,000 km which is about a fourth of full utilization, and for buses&#13;
it is 28,000 km which is about half the full utilization rate.&#13;
B.    Public Expenditure in the Road Sector&#13;
4.    Over the decade 1980-90, the road network in Yemen grew rapidly from about 2,900 kms to 4,900&#13;
kms, and in early 1993 the length of the paved road network, including projects under construction, stood&#13;
at 5,734 kms. Major construction and rehabilitation projects in the FY93/94 program included a number&#13;
of projects to improve connections between the north and south, such as the proposed Safir-Hadramout road&#13;
project, the Harib - Marib road and others. This rapid expansion of the network has caused public&#13;
expenditures in the sector to become heavily concentrated on construction of new roads, and maintenance&#13;
expenditures have come under increasing pressure. The road sector budgets for 1991, 1992 and 1993 (see&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Table 1) show the emphasis placed on new construction versus maintenance. During the last three years&#13;
around 80% of the total expenditures (YR 3347 million) have been used for construction of new roads, while&#13;
only 8.4% (YR 280 million) have been used for rehabilitation and strengthening of paved roads, and 10.7 %&#13;
(YR 358 million) have been used for ordinary maintenance. When converted to constant 1991 prices,&#13;
maintenance expenditures show a declining trend. Of the total maintenance allocation, about 65 % is spent&#13;
on routine maintenance (mainly salary costs), 20 % on periodic maintenance (re-graveling, resealing of paved&#13;
roads), and 15% for road safety and emergencies.&#13;

5.     Even these low allocations for maintenance are being used mostly for routine maintenance, and very&#13;
little periodic maintenance is undertaken. Paved roads are thus allowed to deteriorate until strengthening&#13;
by thick asphalt concrete (AC) overlays or reconstruction is called for. As a result about one third of the&#13;
paved road network is rated as being in poor or worse condition, and only half the paved network is rated&#13;
"good" or better (see Table 2). The condition of the network imposes very significant costs both due to&#13;
increased vehicle operating costs, and due to the need for expensive reconstruction of large sections of the&#13;
network. Past neglect of maintenance has created an immediate need to both increase funding of normal&#13;
(routine and periodic) maintenance as well as to undertake a stabilization program over the next five to six&#13;
years to restore the network to a maintainable condition. It is estimated that maintenance expenditures need&#13;
to be increased to between YR 1600 million and YR 1700 million per annum in order to adequately provide&#13;
for timely routine and periodic maintenance, and for stabilization of the existing network (see Annex 2 for&#13;
details on the stabilization program).&#13;

Financing Road Maintenance&#13;
6.     Such a considerable increase in maintenance and rehabilitation expenditures, out of the Government's&#13;
overall budgetary resources, is especially difficult at present in view of the severe fiscal constraints facing the&#13;
Government. Nor is such an increase in funding of the road sector from general revenues desirable, since road&#13;
users who will be the beneficiaries of improved maintenance should, on efficiency grounds, be required to pay&#13;
for the cost of maintaining road infrastructure. Presently, it is estimated that total resources mobilized in the&#13;
road sector (in 1992) from fees, taxes and duties on sector inputs is on the order of YR 1462 million which&#13;
is about equal to the total outlays of about YR 1.6 billion. However, much of the revenue sources in the sector&#13;
are really contributors to general revenues, eg. import duties on vehicle and spares (63% of road sector&#13;
revenues) and should not therefore be considered road user charges. Fuel taxes contribute another 18 percent,&#13;
annual vehicle fees, license fees, etc. provide the remaining 20 percent.&#13;
7.    Only vehicle license and registration fees can properly be considered road user charges, and these&#13;
presently total only YR 300 million. Annual road tax on trucks at YR 350 per ton of capacity and on buses&#13;
of YR 50 per seat are clearly not recovering from heavy vehicles the extra cost of infrastructure provision that&#13;
they impose. These figures indicate that direct cost recovery from road users is exceedingly low, and increases&#13;
in road maintenance financing should simultaneously put in place mechanisms to improve cost recovery in the&#13;
sector.&#13;
Road User Charges&#13;
8.    Previous IDA Credits, 1848-YAR and 1823-YDR, required that road user charges be reviewed, and&#13;
the former agreement also called for a review of petroleum pricing. While road user charges have been revised&#13;
from time to time, cost recovery in the road sector has not kept pace with road expenditures largely due to the&#13;
difficulty of raising significant amounts of resources through instruments such as vehicle license and registration&#13;
fees. The problems associated with these instruments has prompted the Government to consider mobilizing&#13;
resources for the sector through a surcharge on fuel sales, which is an instrument that has been used&#13;
successfully in a number of countries. A road user surcharge (RUS) imposed on fuel sales has a number of&#13;
advantages: (a) it is directly related to the extent of road use; (b) the burden is spread over a period of time&#13;
and each payment is relatively small thereby avoiding the difficulties associated with collection of large&#13;
payments such as an annual road tax; and (c) it does not have any perverse effects such as the safety problems&#13;
associated with instruments such as a surcharge on tyres.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Page 4 of 9                                                                                   20&#13;
9.    It is expected that based on present fuel consumption levels, the RUS would need to be set at about&#13;
YR 1.0 per liter which is about 2 percent of the price of gasoline (YR 50/lt). It should be noted that fuel&#13;
prices in Yemen are extremely low (in relation to border prices), and future price increases to bring fuel prices&#13;
in line with international prices will reduce the proportionate impact of the RUS on fuel prices. This will hold&#13;
true even though the absolute level of the RUS may need to be revised upwards to compensate for declines in&#13;
consumption caused by increases in fuel prices.&#13;
10.   In discussions with the Ministries of Planning and Finance, recent difficulties encountered in increasing&#13;
diesel prices, to which the agricultural sector is particularly sensitive, were highlighted. While the concept of&#13;
a fuel surcharge was accepted in principle, it was felt that political considerations would require that the initial&#13;
RUS on fuel should be restricted to petrol only, and a surcharge on diesel could be introduced at a later stage.&#13;
Since this would exclude heavy vehicles, which are also responsible for most of the road damage, an increase&#13;
in heavy vehicle fees would be used in combination with the surcharge on petrol. Further, to ensure that the&#13;
legislation does not exclude introduction of a surcharge on diesel in the future, the legislation would exclude&#13;
a diesel surcharge in the initial years, but provide for its introduction in the future by specifying the initial&#13;
surcharge as YR 0.5/liter for petrol and YR 0.0/liter for diesel.&#13;
Road Maintenance Fund&#13;
11.   To ensure that improved cost recovery in the road sector does in fact lead to improvements in the&#13;
condition of roads, road maintenance budgets need to be protected in relation to new construction budgets&#13;
which have been consuming a disproportionate share of expenditures in the sector. Further, unless increases&#13;
in road user charges are directly linked to increases in road maintenance expenditures, and a consequent&#13;
improvement in the condition of the network, road users would be unwilling to pay the additional charges.&#13;
Therefore, Government intends to establish a Road Maintenance Fund (RMF) into which road user charges&#13;
collected through vehicle registration and license fees, and the RUS on fuel sales would be deposited.&#13;
12.   Based on the YR 0.5/liter RUS on petrol, at present consumption levels, and an increase in heavy&#13;
vehicle license fees (for recommended schedule of heavy vehicle fees see Alternative 2, in Table 8 of Annex&#13;
2), and remittance of existing vehicle registration and license fees to the RMF, it is expected that the RMF&#13;
would receive about YR 1200 million in its initial year of operation. While this is somewhat below the&#13;
estimated YR 3200 million needed for the first year of the road network stabilization program, the domestic&#13;
road maintenance and rehabilitation capacity available will probably not be able to absorb more than the YR&#13;
1200 million likely to be available in the initial years. With respect to foreign exchange needs, MOF indicated&#13;
that no allocations of foreign exchange were likely to be available to the RMF, and all inputs would have to&#13;
be procured in the local market. Once established and functioning, the RMF could be augmented by&#13;
development assistance to finance the foreign exchange component of the stabilization program, and the&#13;
legislation establishing the RMF allows for external debt financing of road rehabilitation/reconstruction works.&#13;
13.   A technical memorandum (Annex 2) on the establishment of a Road Maintenance Fund financed&#13;
through a Road User Surcharge on fuel sales and other road user fees has been prepared in consultation with&#13;
the Ministries of Finance, Planning and Construction.  The memorandum  also describes institutional&#13;
arrangements for the management of road maintenance programs and expenditures by creating a new&#13;
autonomous institution (the Yemen Road Fund Board, paras. 20 and 21) to manage the preservation of the road&#13;
network. This would provide the private sector contractors with the opportunity to provide road maintenance&#13;
services such as road pavement strengthening and road rehabilitation. Based on this memorandum, Ministry&#13;
of Construction, Housing and Urban Planning has prepared a draft law to establish the Road Maintenance Fund&#13;
and authorize Road User Surcharges on fuel sales. The draft law incorporates some additional features. In&#13;
addition to the surcharge on fuel sales, it authorizes the remittance of vehicle registration and annual license&#13;
fees, collected by the Customs Department, and truck overloading penalties, to be collected by the Ministry&#13;
of Finance, into the Road Maintenance Fund on a monthly basis.&#13;

C.    Institutional Framework&#13;
14.   The Ministry of Construction, Housing and Urban Planning (MOC) has overall responsibility for&#13;
construction and maintenance of all roads in Yemen, except feeder roads (Ministry of Agriculture) and earth&#13;
tracks which are maintained by the Ministry of Local Administration. The General Corporation for Roads and&#13;
Bridges (GCRB) is organized as an autonomous entity, under MOC, to implement construction and maintenance&#13;
activities. GCRB was established after reunification by merging the road administrations of North- and South-&#13;
Yemen. However, the Public Corporation for Road Construction (PCRC), which employs most of the staff&#13;
of the former road authority in the South, has not yet been merged but discussions on this are underway. The&#13;
Ministry is also responsible for the administration of government tenders, which is carried out by a High&#13;
Tender Board for all Government procurement above YR 50 million, and for all foreign assisted procurement.&#13;
The organization structure of MOC and GCRB for the road sector is shown in Chart I attached.&#13;
15.   MOC has about 750 employees, and GCRB has in addition about 3,200 employees, of which more than&#13;
2,000 employees work on new construction projects. GCRB staff are part of the civil service, but allowed&#13;
more competitive remuneration for skilled technical personnel. For instance, engineers are paid about 40-50&#13;
percent more than civil service engineers. Though GCRB depends on the government's budget for the&#13;
contracts which fund all its activities, no salaries or overhead costs are funded directly by the Government,&#13;
thereby seeking to ensure that GCRB operates like a corporate entity. However, there is little evidence of&#13;
financial autonomy; payments to contractors and consultants are made by the Ministry of Finance, and about&#13;
50 different signatures are needed for a single payment to be approved. Despite these difficulties, a major&#13;
achievement of GCRB has been its effective use of private contractors and consultants while maintaining a force&#13;
account capability.&#13;
Road Maintenance Organization&#13;
16.   The road network under MOC's authority consists of about 5,000 km of paved roads and about 10,000&#13;
km of other roads (of which about 2,000 km are gravel roads that receive regular maintenance by GCRB).&#13;
Maintenance of paved and gravel roads is undertaken by the Directorate General of Maintenance located within&#13;
GCRB. The General Manager for Maintenance is in charge of an organization of about 750 permanent staff&#13;
and on average 200-250 laborers on daily wages. The organization contains 9 regular Maintenance Divisions&#13;
each headed by a Director. The decentralized divisions are responsible for one or more governorates, and are&#13;
located at district centers. Maintenance teams within each division are responsible for geographical sections&#13;
of the road network. There are also specialized groups at headquarters level for road safety, traffic survey and&#13;
road sign/marking works.&#13;
17.    The organizational structure for maintenance appears fragmented with a large number of units&#13;
reporting directly to the General Manager with apparently little delegation or decentralization. The department,&#13;
while employing around a third of GCRB staff, is only managing 3 percent of the road budget or about US$1.5&#13;
million. This amounts to about US$300 per km of paved road. Further, more than half of the funds are used&#13;
for salaries, and a large part of the materials and equipment procured are for gravel roads (re-graveling of&#13;
about 150 km a year and gravel shoulder repair), and as a result little funds are actually spent on routine and&#13;
periodic maintenance of paved roads. Consequently, very little regular maintenance activity is observable on&#13;
the paved road network.&#13;

Use of Domestic Contractors&#13;
18.   GCRB executes road construction by a combination of force account (40%), local contractors (30%),&#13;
and international contractors (30%). About half of locally funded road construction works are carried out by&#13;
private contractors. Donor funded road projects are in general carried out by private contractors, though in&#13;
a few special cases GCRB has been executing the works by force account in agreement with the respective&#13;
donors. All new bridge works are carried out by contractors. GCRB also uses smaller local contractors as&#13;
sub-contractors in force account works, and about 5 of the 40 percent force account works is carried out by&#13;
small domestic contractors, mainly for drainage and smaller concrete works. GCRB uses consultants to&#13;
undertake feasibility studies, design, and construction supervision with the only exception that GCRB supervises&#13;
itself on force account works that are 100 percent locally financed. Most of the consultants are international&#13;
firms. This balanced use of contractors and consultants in construction works is an institutional strength of&#13;
GCRB.&#13;
Institutional Development Concerns&#13;
19.   Despite the many strengths of the Ministry of Construction, Housing and Urban Planning and GCRB,&#13;
there are a number of problems that need to be addressed.&#13;
* GCRB has expressed interest in bidding on IDA-financed projects as an independent contractor.&#13;
However, the present close linkage between GCRB and the Ministry, and the lack of financial&#13;
autonomy, reduces market discipline to which GCRB operations are subject, and therefore makes&#13;
it inappropriate at present for GCRB to bid in competition with the private sector.&#13;
* The costs of GCRB's force account operations are distorted by a number of factors which cause&#13;
comparisons between GCRB and private contractors to be biased in favor of GCRB. Deficiencies&#13;
in costing include, rates for equipment not adequately reflecting replacement costs, and foreign&#13;
exchange costs being valued at a much lower official exchange rate. For GCRB to be fully&#13;
commercialized, the cost accounting system would have to be reconfigured to allow full cost&#13;
accounting and pricing of the works carried out by GCRB.&#13;
* There is a tendency to adhere to existing road construction practices, partly due to a lack of&#13;
financial inputs to decision-making, but also due to a lack of assessment of institutional&#13;
performance. An example is GCRB's reluctance to use double bituminous surface treatment as the&#13;
wearing course on low traffic volume roads, although it may be cheaper. Most developed&#13;
countries cannot afford such a policy. There are also examples of premature cracking and rutting&#13;
on newly constructed pavements, without investigations being initiated to learn from possible&#13;
mistakes.&#13;
Institutional Restructuring&#13;
20.   An option which addresses many of the above problems would be the establishment of a fully&#13;
autonomous road agency, with independent funding from road user charges, which is responsible for&#13;
preservation of the highway system (see also discussion of Road Maintenance Fund, Annex 2). Such an&#13;
agency, referred to here as the Yemen Road Fund Board (YRFB) would not execute any works itself but would&#13;
contract for maintenance and rehabilitation works with private contractors and public sector contractors such&#13;
as GCRB. The Government would not involve itself in day-to-day management, but would appoint a&#13;
commercially oriented Board of Directors with representation also from road users and the road contracting&#13;
industry. The YRFB's primary responsibilities would be:&#13;
(a)    development of multi-year maintenance and rehabilitation programs and the approval of an&#13;
annual program of works;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
23                                                                                Page 7of 9&#13;
(b)    managing the Road Maintenance Fund and recommending appropriate changes in road user&#13;
charges based on properly established funding needs;&#13;
(c)    monitoring the condition of the road network; and&#13;
(d)    controlling the maintenance and rehabilitation works carried out by private contractors and by&#13;
GCRB.&#13;
The YRFB would be set up so that public sector contractors are required to compete with each other and with&#13;
the private sector, and all payments made would be on the basis of actual works accomplished. By retaining&#13;
a commercially oriented construction capability within GCRB, the YRFB would also deter collusion for&#13;
contracting services, and retain a capacity to respond to emergencies.&#13;
21.   The advantages of such an institutional arrangement are: (a) competitive contracting of all road works&#13;
including those carried out by GCRB; (b) GCRB operations can be commercialized; (c) increased motivation&#13;
and efficiency of staff through better training and salaries that are competitive with those paid by the private&#13;
sector in Yemen; (d) a clearer relationship between road user charges, the quality of roads, and accountability&#13;
for road maintenance; and (e) reduced demand on the Government's budget by eliminating present allocations&#13;
for road maintenance which would then be entirely financed through road user charges. Implementation of&#13;
such changes requires a high level of commitment, and considerable efforts to train staff, and to put in place&#13;
new institutional mechanisms and processes, and MOC and the Ministries of Finance and Planning have&#13;
expressed their strong support for such an institutional restructuring. Technical assistance to be provided under&#13;
the project includes a component to develop new institutional structures and operational procedures for the&#13;
Yemen Road Fund Board. The TOR also includes support to commercialize GCRB's operations and develop&#13;
the local contracting industry.&#13;
D.    Road Transport&#13;
22.   Since unification of the country in 1990, a number of anomalies have developed in the road transport&#13;
sector owing to incompatibilities between policies in the North and the South prior to unification, and these&#13;
have compounded the previous distortions in the sector. In a number of areas such as tariff regulation,&#13;
transport industry organization, etc., policies in the North and South sometimes work at cross-purposes, and&#13;
create strong distortions and inefficiencies.  Compliance with existing covenants under the various Credit&#13;
Agreements entered into with the former YAR and PDRY Governments has also been affected by the changes&#13;
following unification.&#13;
23.   According to an axle load survey conducted in 1987, there is a very significant axle load problem in&#13;
the North. The survey found average rear single axle loads of 20 tons, and average rear tandem axle loads&#13;
of 33 tons, while proposed axle load controls would limit these to 13 and 21 tons, respectively. These average&#13;
axle loads appear to be high, and are probably due to the surveys being conducted on loaded direction lanes&#13;
and near main traffic generating centers such as Hodeidah Port. Nevertheless, it is widely agreed that high&#13;
axle loads are a common problem.&#13;
24.   Under Credit 2177-YEM it was agreed that GOY would provide the Association, by March 31, 1992,&#13;
an analysis of truck overloading, and would implement, by June 30, 1992, a program for enforcing axle load&#13;
limits. An analysis of axle loads has been provided to the appraisal mission, and legislation to revise and unify&#13;
existing axle load controls of the former YAR and PDRY Governments, together with a Prime Ministerial&#13;
Decree on implementing arrangements has been enacted. The legislation limits axle loads to 13 tons for single&#13;
axles and 21 tons for tandem axles. Previous credits have also financed the installation of truck weighing&#13;
stations at Hodeidah, Mokha and Harad, and these weigh stations have remained unutilized since 1988.&#13;
Enforcement of axle load controls need not present any administrative difficulties, since the Ferzah operators&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

could be instructed to allocate cargo in accordance with the rated capacity of various truck types, thereby&#13;
reducing the need for stopping and weighing of loaded trucks and the discharging of excess cargo.  Such&#13;
measures will however require that present controls on freight tariffs be removed to allow truck operators to&#13;
make a profit on the reduced payloads.&#13;
Policy Actions&#13;
25.    Table 3 summarizes the issues and actions discussed above on which agreement was reached in the&#13;
form of a letter of sector strategy and policy. The Letter of Road Sector Strategy &amp; Policy, discussed and&#13;
agreed at negotiation, is attached as Annex 3. During the project, technical assistance to be provided under&#13;
agreed Terms of Reference would assist Government in implementing actions set out in the Letter of Road&#13;
Sector Strategy and Policy.&#13;

TRANSPORT REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Road Maintenance Fund&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.     Road maintenance is a high priority, with economic returns often above 25% or even much higher.&#13;
Any rational public expenditure program should therefore give road maintenance a high priority on a&#13;
continuing basis. Due to a difficult budget situation it has not been possible to allocate sufficient funds for&#13;
routine and periodic road maintenance in Yemen, in spite of the well documented economic benefits of&#13;
maintenance operations. This has resulted in a considerable backlog of deferred road maintenance, a problem&#13;
which now has to be addressed by much more costly rehabilitation and reconstruction. The recent need to&#13;
use IDA credit funds for rehabilitation studies of more than 700 km of existing roads, badly in need of&#13;
recurrent and periodic maintenance, and possibly beyond economic repair by the time the studies are finished&#13;
and financing arranged, is an example of the effects of the current problem.&#13;
II. ROAD CONDITIONS&#13;
2.     The quality of a road can be measured in quantitative terms by 'roughness' measures such as the&#13;
International Roughness Index (IRI). If not maintained, paved roads deteriorate very rapidly after a certain&#13;
stage in their life cycle. The deterioration of unmaintained paved roads follow a typical non-linear path as&#13;
shown in Figure 1(') .&#13;

Simulation with the HDM-I model.&#13;
Based on an example from the World Bank report "Road Deterioration in Developing Countries", October 15, 1987&#13;
where development of roughness for a road with asphalt concrete pavement and minimal maintenance is simulated&#13;
with the World Bank's HDM-III model.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 2 of 14                                                                                 27&#13;
During a long initial phase which lasts up to two-thirds of the life cycle, paved roads undergo little visible&#13;
deterioration. This stage is followed by a phase of increasing deterioration; first slowly, but then rapidly&#13;
accelerating into 'fair condition', which ends within a few years in radical structural failure ('poor condition').&#13;
For the unwary, this characteristic of paved roads tends to disguise future maintenance requirements of young&#13;
road networks. During the first phase, maintenance needs are minimal, and a paved road can be kept in good&#13;
condition by fairly inexpensive routine maintenance. In the subsequent phase of increasing deterioration (into&#13;
fair condition), the pavement can be restored to good condition. This can be done by patching and resealing,&#13;
or by strengthening the pavement with an overlay. The latter, which is a moderately costly measure, restores&#13;
the road's structural strength and riding quality so as to meet traffic requirements for the next several years,&#13;
thus starting a new pavement cycle.  With appropriate routine maintenance and timely resealing or&#13;
strengthening, a paved road should be kept from deteriorating into poor condition, which requires far more&#13;
costly reconstruction. Unfortunately, a large part of the paved road network in Yemen has now entered the&#13;
critical life-cycle stage in Figure 1.&#13;
Vehicle Operating Costs&#13;
3.     Broadly speaking, the total costs of road transport are made up of vehicle operating costs and the&#13;
investment and maintenance costs related to provision of road services. Except where traffic is very light,&#13;
the vehicle operating costs constitute the major part of total road transport costs. This has important&#13;
implications for road management and maintenance. As vehicle operating costs are closely related to road&#13;
condition as measured by the 'roughness', the development of road user costs on a paved road will follow&#13;
the same non-linear path as in Figure 1. Hence, the costs to the road users increase progressively when the&#13;
road is allowed to develop into the critical life-cycle stage. As Vehicle Operating Costs (VOC) constitute such&#13;
a large part of total road transport costs, even a small percentage increase in the VOC from rougher roads&#13;
is significant, outweighing the cost savings from deferred maintenance. Continued under-financing of mainte-&#13;
nance may thus lead to many times its costs in higher vehicle operating costs as well as higher rehabilitation&#13;
costs.&#13;
Ill. REHABILITATION AND MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS&#13;
4.     Table 1 provides an overview of the actual maintenance requirements as estimated by MOC compared&#13;
to the Government budget allocations for 1994. As can be seen from Table 1, current budget allocations fall&#13;
substantially short of actual requirements for a full maintenance program. Total costs of a full maintenance&#13;
program are estimated to YR 1286 million/year whereas the overall budget allocation is only YR 347 million&#13;
for 1994. Hence, the shortfall is ca. YR 940 million, or about 73%. Routine maintenance of the main roads&#13;
will cost YR 106 million per year(2), which may be compared with the present budget allocation of YR 23&#13;
million. The need for recurrent maintenance (patching of potholes on paved roads and reshaping of roadway&#13;
and ditches on unpaved roads) is estimated to be YR 250 million per year, compared with a budget allocation&#13;
of YR 49 million for 1994.&#13;
5.     The cost estimates for periodic maintenance are based on the assumption that resurfacing of the total&#13;
network is required every fourth year. This may overstate the actual need for resealing which is normally&#13;
carried out at intervals of 6-8 years. Hence, the total costs of YR 352.5 million/year for resealing appear to&#13;
(2)    This covers the 4,300 km of paved and 1000 km of gravel roads which currently are the responsibilty of GCRB.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
28                                                                                       Page 3 of 14&#13;
be on the high side(3). Based on a six-year standard the total cost of periodic maintenance would amount to&#13;
YR 258 million/year, which may be compared with a current budget allocation of YR 75.5 million for 1994.&#13;
6.     As shown in Section 2, a large part of the paved roads network is in critical need of&#13;
strengthening/overlaying or more comprehensive rehabilitation. Some 187 km of paved roads have been&#13;
subject to strengthening or rehabilitation since 1991. There are plans, ongoing works and committed financial&#13;
resources available for rehabilitation of another 251 km at a total cost of YR 693 million(4) in 1994, including&#13;
the separate budget allocation of YR 200 million provided by the Government for strengthening/overlaying&#13;
(see Table 1). In Table 1 a separate allowance of YR 298.5 million was suggested for simple maintenance&#13;
of the ruralfeeder roads, just to keep them open. However, no allocation has been made for this in 1994.&#13;
Clearly, some resources will also have to be used for emergency repairs or very rudimentary maintenance&#13;
of the rural feeder roads, just to assure their passabillity.&#13;
Requirements to clear the backlog and preserve the existing paved roads&#13;
7.     It is difficult to assess how much resources will be available for rehabilitation and strengthening of&#13;
the paved roads in the coming years. Existing plans prepared by the Planning Department in GCRB show&#13;
that emphasis is put on new construction rather than rehabilitation and strengthening of existing roads.&#13;
According to the current plan, some YR 10 billion can be expected to be used for new construction during&#13;
the five-year period 1994-1998, while YR 1.4 billion may be used for rehabilitation and strengthening of the&#13;
existing roads('). This will only allow for strengthening of about 160 km of paved road every year, and the&#13;
entire network every 27 years(6). This is substantially less than actual requirements to clear the backlog for&#13;
urgent rehabilitation works and preserve remaining roads in good condition. At the prevailing traffic levels,&#13;
axle loads, maintenance and design standards, one would expect that overlaying of paved roads would nor-&#13;
mally be required every 10-12 years. GCRB's own estimates indicate that in order to clear the backlog and&#13;
preserve the existing paved roads it would be necessary to carry out rehabilitation of approximately 900 km&#13;
and strengthening of another 1000 km during the next 5 years. This is considerably more than the 800 km&#13;
allowed for in the existing plans which are based on the recognition that government budgets will be very&#13;
tight also in the coming years.&#13;
8.     Stabilization of the existing paved roads within a 5 years period would consequently require&#13;
rehabilitation and strengthening of an average of 380 km/year during the next 5 years. As GCRB is presently&#13;
involved in rehabilitation of the paved roads and has previously carried out overlaying until 1989, and since&#13;
the necessary equipment will soon be available for these operations, it is conceivable that GCRB could carry&#13;
out a substantial part of the required rehabilitation and strengthening if adequate resources are provided(').&#13;
A stabilization program may thus be formulated as shown in Table 2.&#13;
(3)    In practice this wiU of course depend on a number of factors, including the number and thickness of layers, climate&#13;
conditions, the costs of resealing relative to vehicle operating costs etc., and may differfrom case to case. In&#13;
general, however, it seems like most countries rely on less frequent resealing than every 4th year, and the&#13;
economics of longer intervals tend to be reconfirmed by simulations with transport economic models.&#13;

(local and foreign financing) for ongoing rehabilitation projects from previous years.&#13;

9.     It should be emphasized that this plan is only an example. The cost estimates may be uncertain, and&#13;
the distribution of works between GCRB and contractors may be different. However, Table 2 demonstrates&#13;
that considerable resources will have to be allocated to such a program if the existing paved roads network&#13;
shall be preserved in good condition. It is assumed that rehabilitation and strengthening of altogether 251&#13;
km of the paved roads at a total cost of YR 693 million will be carried out according to the existing plans&#13;
in 1994. Altogether the total costs of such a stabilization program would be close to YR 4 billion, or about&#13;
YR 780 million/year measured in constant 1993 prices. Due to the substantial financial requirement, the&#13;
question may arise as to whether the stabilization program can be carried out over a longer time span, thus&#13;
reducing the annual costs during the first years. This would have to be considered carefully, as delaying the&#13;
program may substantially increase the costs of rehabilitation and the need for full reconstruction of road&#13;
sections.&#13;
Funding requirements for a stabilization program and preventive maintenance&#13;
10.    Table 3 shows total funding requirements for the stabilization program in Table 2, and preventive&#13;
maintenance for the years 1994 - 1998. Annual maintenance costs are based on MOC's estimates in Table&#13;
1, except for the periodic maintenance of paved roads where it has been assumed that resealing every 6th year&#13;
will be sufficient.  Hence, total funding requirements for preventive maintenance, rehabilitation and&#13;
stabilization of the principal road network can be estimated to approximately YR 1,300 - 1,500 million/year&#13;
in 1993 prices. Allowing also for the most basic maintenance of the rural feeder roads, total financial&#13;
requirements increase to YR 1,600 - 1,800 million/year.&#13;

IV. ROAD SECTOR CASH FLOWS&#13;
11.   The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of the actual financial situation in the road&#13;
sector, and to prepare a basis for analyzing possible solutions to the financing problem described in Section&#13;
3. Hence, this section looks into the resource availability, financial constraints and current priorities in the&#13;
road sector. It also examines existing taxation of road users and their contribution to cover the real economic&#13;
costs of the road services, and the extent to which there is a potential for increasing road user charges to&#13;
finance rehabilitation and maintenance.&#13;
Revenues from the road sector&#13;
12.    Table 4 shows the public revenues from the road sector for 1991 and 1992 and a preliminary estimate&#13;
for 1993. As can be seen from Table 4, import duties on vehicles and spare parts generally account for some&#13;
60% of total road sector revenues. In 1992, total import duties on vehicles and spares amounted to about&#13;
YR 924 million.&#13;

13.   The second largest component is sales taxes on petrol (YR 0.25/liter), diesel (YR 0.10/liter) and&#13;
lubricants (YR 1.225/kg) which generated YR 231 million in revenues in 1992. Contrary to most other&#13;
countries, existing fuel taxes in Yemen represent a modest source for public revenues. Being only 4.2% and&#13;
3.3% of current pump prices, existing fuel taxes on petrol and diesel must be considered very low compared&#13;
with most other countries(8). Moreover, as Yemen is self-sufficient in petroleum products and domestic&#13;
petroleum product prices are set independent of international market prices, there are no direct links between&#13;
international and domestic fuel prices which can ensure economically efficient pricing. On the contrary, the&#13;
prevailing pump prices have remained constant during a long period of high inflation (about 40 percent p.a.&#13;
at present), thus declining rapidly in real terms. Converted at the current parallel market rate of YR 60/US$&#13;
, the existing pump prices of petrol and diesel amount to USc 10 and USc 5 per liter respectively, which is&#13;
much lower than the average export value (f.o.b.) of Yemen's crude oil or refined products. Hence, in effect&#13;
there is a substantial element of implicit subsidies in current fuel prices to domestic consumers. Rather than&#13;
paying net taxes on diesel and petrol to the Government, which is the normal situation in most countries,&#13;
domestic consumers in Yemen enjoy pump prices which are far below the sum of refining costs, distribution&#13;
costs and the real economic value (i.e. export parity price) of petroleum which alternatively could be exported&#13;
to the international market.&#13;
(8)    Subsequent to the preparation of this note, in early 1995, taxes on gasoline were raised substantialy increasing fuel&#13;
prices by about 100%.&#13;

14.   Annual license fees collected from vehicle owners constitute the third most important source of&#13;
revenues. In 1991 and 1992 they were YR 190 and YR 212 million respectively. Based on a total number&#13;
of ca. 440,000 registered vehicles in 1992, the average annual license was about YR 480/vehicle (US$&#13;
8/vehicle when converted at the market rate). Heavy goods vehicles and buses pay more than cars and pick-&#13;
ups; YR 350 per tonne of gross vehicle weight for trucks and YR 50 per seat for buses, compared with YR&#13;
400 for private cars. However there is a tremendous problem related to evasion of license fees as many of&#13;
the vehicles in Yemen may not actually be registered. This makes annual license fees a somewhat uncertain,&#13;
inefficient and unequitable (penalizing honest vehicle owners) source of revenues.&#13;
Sources and Uses of Funds, GCRB 1991-1993&#13;
15.   Table 5 shows the overall Sources and Uses of Funds statements for GCRB in 1991-1993 prepared&#13;
by the Planning and Statistics Department. During the last three years around 80% of the total expenditures&#13;
(YR 3347 million) have been used for construction of new roads, while only 8.4% (YR 280 million) have&#13;
been used for rehabilitation and strengthening of paved roads, and 10.7% (YR 358 million) have been used&#13;
for ordinary maintenance. External financing in terms of loans and grants have accounted for some 25% of&#13;
total expenditures when converted to YR at the official exchange rate (YR 121US$ ), while the balance (ca.&#13;
75%) has been made up by Government contributions. There are currently no other sources of financing for&#13;
the road sector. Most of the new construction has been carried out by contractors (75%), while most of the&#13;
rehabilitation and strengthening of paved roads, and all maintenance works, have been carried out by GCRB.&#13;

16.   The foreign loans are tied to special new construction and rehabilitation projects and can therefore&#13;
generally not be reallocated to maintenance operations. The budget for general maintenance is agreed from&#13;
year to year with the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and covered by the general budget. It may be noticed that&#13;
the original budget allocations for maintenance have proved insufficient every year, and that extra provisions&#13;
have been made every year since 1990. From the total road sector budget of YR 7.7 billion for the period&#13;
1991-1993, only 4.7% was allocated to preventive maintenance. This is by all means very low and not&#13;
compatible with efficient management of the road network.&#13;
Development of road maintenance between 1990-1993&#13;
17.   From previous discussions it is clear that allocations for preventive maintenance have been insufficient&#13;
for a number of years. Actual maintenance and strengthening needs have on the other hand increased rapidly&#13;
due to a combination of high age, excessive axle loads and low maintenance in the past, which has resulted&#13;
in rapid deterioration of a substantial part of the main road network. There is little evidence, however, that&#13;
the actual amount of physical resources spent on maintenance per km road has been increasing. According&#13;
to GCRB records, the total amount of patching and resealing of paved roads was 198,400 m2 in 1992,&#13;
compared with 226,700 m2 in 1991, and 204,150 m2 in 1990. Only significant increases were in&#13;
regravelling of gravel roads which increased by three times from 1990 to 1991, and almost doubled from&#13;
1991 to 1992. Although the general inflation has been high during 1991-1993, recalculation of the&#13;
maintenance expenditures in constant 1991 prices indicates a significant reduction in maintenance&#13;
expenditures (see Table 6).&#13;

Roads are not subject to routine or periodic maintenance while they undergo rehabilitation or strengthening.&#13;
V. FINANCING REHABILITATION AND PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE&#13;
18.   There are basically four ways to increase the funds for rehabilitation and maintenance. That is:&#13;
-     increase Government budget allocations;&#13;
-     reallocate resources from new construction of roads;&#13;
-     increase external borrowing; and&#13;
-     creation of a dedicated road fund based on additional road user charges.&#13;
19.   The budget situation is very difficult and can be expected to remain so for sometime. The current&#13;
deficit is around YR 35 billion there is tremendous pressure to cut spending and increase revenues. Hence,&#13;
there is little room for increased allocations over the ordinary budget. Reallocation of resources from new&#13;
construction would clearly be desirable, but may be politically sensitive and prove difficult in practice.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
34                                                                             Page 9 of 14&#13;
20.   In view of the high financing requirements for a stabilization program, increased external borrowing&#13;
would be required in the first years. With the current foreign exchange constraints it is quite clear that&#13;
foreign currency allocations for maintenance and rehabilitation will be difficult to obtain from the Central&#13;
Bank in the coming years, so that the immediate need for hard currency to pay for foreign contractors and&#13;
imported materials/equipment will either have to be covered by purchases in the parallel market or borrowed&#13;
abroad. Although external borrowing may be required for rehabilitation works, it cannot be recommended&#13;
that maintenance policy be based on loan financing from abroad. The Government will not (and should not)&#13;
allow for accrual of an increasing amount of new foreign debt to finance maintenance. Hence, a more&#13;
sustainable solution to the financing problem must be found. This raises the question of creating a dedicated&#13;
roadfimndforfinancing of rehabilitation and preventive maintenance based on additional road user charges.&#13;
Creation of an independent road fund&#13;
21.   A dedicated road fund has been established with success in a number of other countries, such as USA,&#13;
Japan, Tanzania, Ghana, Mozambique, Colombia and Zaire. It is nornally financed through a system of&#13;
additional road user charges or road tolls; typically levied as a fuel surcharge (say 10% - 20% of pump&#13;
prices) and special heavy vehicles license fees. Such a fund could enable the authorities to finance the&#13;
stabilization program, thus clearing the backlog within 5 (or may be 7) years.&#13;
22.   Based on the existing number of registered heavy vehicles and fuel consumption (Table 7), a menu&#13;
for different combinations of additional road user charges can be prepared as shown in Table 8. The&#13;
additional road user charges can be designed as a traditional two-part tariff, with the license fee as the access&#13;
fee, and the fuel surcharge as the user charge. For the purpose of illustration, alternative combinations have&#13;
been calculated in Table 8 in order to show the revenue effect. The basic assumptions are provided in Table&#13;
7, while the additional license fees applicable to the different vehicle types is provided in Table 8.&#13;

Structure of additional road user charges&#13;
23.    Basically, it is the heavy vehicles which damage the roads. The heavy vehicle license fee has&#13;
therefore been related to the average axle weight (number of equivalent standard axles times a base fee) of&#13;
the different vehicles according to the findings in recent axle load surveys. In this way, the heavy vehicle&#13;
license fee will be related to the damaging power of the various vehicle categories(9). For the same reason&#13;
it may be argued that thefuel surcharge should be levied on diesel only, since this is the fuel utilized by the&#13;
heavy vehicles. However, it has been suggested that the fuel surcharge should initially be levied on petrol&#13;
only as a significant part (though not more than 30%) of diesel is consumed by the agricultural sector which&#13;
is very sensitive to price changes.&#13;
24.    Hence, if the Government is willing to consider a system of increased road user charges, it is strongly&#13;
recommended that eventually a system consisting of an additional fuel surcharge levied on both diesel and&#13;
petrol in combination with an additional heavy vehicle fee be adopted as shown in Table 8. This would&#13;
provide the best incentive structure as well as the highest revenue. As an initial step, however, a surcharge&#13;
on petrol alone, together with the additional vehicle fees, would provide as much revenues as the Road&#13;
Maintenance Fund could absorb in the initial years.&#13;
Adjustment mechanism&#13;
25.    With the current high level of inflation, annualfunding requirements may increase rapidly in nominal&#13;
terms as existing unit costs, input prices and foreign exchange rate are inflated in the next years. It is&#13;
emphasized that the alternatives in Table 8 are based on the prevailing price level and rigidities in the&#13;
foreign exchange market. An appropriate and flexible adjustment mechanism must therefore be established&#13;
so that the additional road user charges can be easily adjusted to reflect inflation or exchange rate&#13;
adjustments, or in response to changing demand and priorities. The principles for calculating the user charges&#13;
remain the same so that this is only a matter of increasing the fuel surcharge and the base fee for the heavy&#13;
vehicle surcharge to reflect a new price level and exchange rate.&#13;
Advantages of an independent road fund&#13;
26.    With such an independent road fund, road users pay for the services they get from the road network,&#13;
just like consumers pay for services from other public utilities, e.g. electricity where the consumers are&#13;
charged for electricity supply, rail services where travellers pay rail fares, water supply where consumers have&#13;
to pay water charges, etc. Hence, those who benefit from having good roads will also be required to pay for&#13;
the maintenance of the roads, a system which corresponds well with established principles of benefit taxation.&#13;
27.    By creating an independent road fund, the government's fiscal situation will improve as the system&#13;
may replace current budget allocations, the heavy bill of rehabilitating and reconstructing roads later will&#13;
be reduced, and most important of all; the steep increase in road user costs which otherwise would occur&#13;
due to increased vehicle operating costs can be avoided. Hence, large economic savings will accrue to the&#13;
private sector. Moreover, as vehicle operating costs and reconstruction costs have a high foreign exchange&#13;
content, creation of a roadfund which allows for increasedfinancing of rehabilitation and maintenance will&#13;
have a positive net impact on the Balance of Payments.&#13;
(9)    The axk loadfactors used will thus have to be adjusted if new surveys indicate different axle loads, e.g. as a result&#13;
of effective enforcement of axle load regulatons. The heavy vehicle license fee can then be adjusted as it always is&#13;
calculated as the product of the number of estimated Equivalent Standard Axles per vehicle type times a basic fee&#13;
used as a scaling factor. See Table 7 and 8 for details.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
36                                                                             Page 11 of 14&#13;
28.   Assured and reliable domestic funding can be expected to produce larger matching funds from&#13;
international aid, thus enabling an ambitious stabilization program to be carried out. Producing domestic&#13;
resources for part of the maintenance and rehabilitation needs is an important condition for securing financing&#13;
from international aid agencies. A dedicated road fund allows regular planning and efficient execution of&#13;
maintenance. Particularly when maintenance is done by contracts, it is critical to have assurance of funding&#13;
in advance, to allow a stable environment for bidding and contract commitments. A Road Maintenance Fund&#13;
provides some assurance for funding even when the general budget situation is fragile. The greater certainty&#13;
of funding may also enable more effective competitive bidding through short notices and time for preparation&#13;
and bigger lots, in stead of small extensions of existing contracts which is the typical solution when funding&#13;
is uncertain. This would bring down actual maintenance and rehabilitation costs. For instance, in Ghana this&#13;
is believed to have reduced the unit costs for maintenance by some 15% - 20%.(!o) As an idea, road-user&#13;
charges dedicated to road maintenance may also appeal to the general public which often might be frustrated&#13;
about road conditions, and thereby enable easier acceptance of the road user charges.&#13;
VI. ADMINISTRATION OF THE ROAD FUND&#13;
29.   Because deterioration of paved roads is so insidious, a road maintenance agency must regularly&#13;
monitor the condition of roads so that maintenance will not be delayed beyond the point at which costs rise&#13;
steeply. The agency must also monitor the volume and mix of traffic and axle loads to determine priorities&#13;
for investment and maintenance. An effective management information system that covers these conditions&#13;
as well as the agency's equipment, supplies, and personnel is a basic requirement for efficient planning and&#13;
deployment of resources. For maximum economic performance, road maintenance policy should be&#13;
coordinated with road design and construction planning, and the life-cycle costs of the roads should be&#13;
balanced against the operating costs of the vehicles using them. This coordination requires a good data-base&#13;
and a capable staff using sound analytical techniques and tools. Strengthening of the institutional capacity&#13;
to carry out annual maintenance planning according to sound economic principles (e.g., based on simulations&#13;
with the HDM-III model) will thus be required to efficiently use the proceeds from a Road Fund. Technical&#13;
assistance to establish this institutional capacity within a newly established Yemen Highways Board would&#13;
be provided by IDA under the proposed project.&#13;
Responsibilities and Functions of Yemen Road Fund Board&#13;
30.   The Yemen Road Fund Board (YRFB) would be responsible for planning and programming of works,&#13;
quality control, and administration of funds, and to discharge these responsibilities would need to be staffed&#13;
and empowered to:&#13;
(a)    Define and classify the road network to be preserved using RMF funding;&#13;
(b)    Manage engineering and economic studies to define multi-year road network stabilization&#13;
programs;&#13;
(c)    Develop and implement arrangements for undertaking maintenance by contract; and&#13;
(d)    Keep adequate financial controls, maintain a Management Information System with&#13;
information on vehicle operating cost savings and maintenance expenditures to allow&#13;
performance budgeting.&#13;

Board of Directors&#13;
31.   In other countries, the Board of Directors, typically consists of high ranking representatives appointed&#13;
by the Ministries of Finance, Planning, Construction and Transport, and representatives from organizations&#13;
which have a genuine interest in good roads, such as the truckers' organization, bus companies' organization,&#13;
'chamber of commerce' etc. The composition of the Board should include representatives appointed by the&#13;
Ministries of Planning, Finance, Construction and Transport representing the public sector. It was suggested&#13;
that the Trucker's Organization and the Chamber of Commerce should appoint one candidate each to&#13;
represent the transport industry and the private sector. The Board of Directors of the YRFB would therefore&#13;
consist of seven members, including the Managing Director of the YRFB who would also serve as Chairman&#13;
of the Board. The main tasks of the Board would be:&#13;
(a)    Set and revise the Road Funds objectives;&#13;
(b)    Appoint the Managing Director and Department Directors of the Road Fund;&#13;
(c)    Monitor and evaluate the performance of the Road Fund;&#13;
(d)    Approve major investment decisions requiring external funds (external borrowing);&#13;
(e)    Approve award of contracts for works; and&#13;
(f)    Recommend adjustments in the fuel surcharge, vehicle registration fees, and annual vehicle&#13;
tax.&#13;
The Board members would be appointed for three-year terms, and would be eligible for one extension.&#13;
Organization&#13;
32.   The fund can be organized according to a trustfund model, with YRFB as trustee for the funds, and&#13;
the proceeds may be used for contracts with both GCRB, local and foreign contractors. Actually, to limit&#13;
the potential for conflict between the planning and control functions and the work execution functions, the&#13;
two functions should preferably be separated with the YRFB performing the former, and public and private&#13;
contractors being responsible for works execution. The organizational structure of the YRFB would be quite&#13;
simple with only three departments: a) Planning, Programming, Budgeting &amp; Finance; b) Contracting of&#13;
Works/ Quality Control; and c) Administrative Support, Public Relations, Personnel &amp; Training.&#13;
33.   The existing road maintenance organization within GCRB and its facilities would be used by the&#13;
YRFB to carry out annual maintenance programs. If GCRB is lacking in capacity, private consultants and&#13;
road contractors would be utilized in order to carry out the road network stabilization program. The same&#13;
applies for road rehabilitation and reconstruction, where GCRB's construction capability would be utilized&#13;
to its practical capacity in competition with the private construction industry.&#13;
&#13;

Annex 2&#13;

Technical Operating Procedures&#13;
34.    A major reason for establishing the YRFB is to put in place more professional, efficient and effective&#13;
technical operating procedures to plan and control the maintenance of the inter-urban national road network.&#13;
To achieve this the YRFB would have to establish and operate an appropriate road maintenance management&#13;
system. A first step in that process would be a well functioning pavement management system to allow the&#13;
remaining life of road pavements to be deternined on a system-wide basis. Some of the elements of a PMS&#13;
are: regular road inventories, road condition surveys, road usage data, and the capability to analyze the data.&#13;
The capability to establish and maintain such a system would have to be developed as part of the technical&#13;
assistance to be provided under the proposed project.&#13;
35.    Also needed is a mechanism to ensure that the fuel surcharge can be adjusted both up and down&#13;
within a reasonably short time is essential for creating a credible system. The Board of the YRFB would be&#13;
mandated to make recommendations on adjustments in the surcharges and fees, which will have to be&#13;
approved by the MOF. It is important to hit the right level and to adjust the fuel surcharge carefully during&#13;
the initial years so as not to set these too high as this could bring the fund into discredit. It is possible that&#13;
it is easier to get acceptance for a stepwise introduction of the fuel surcharge, and that gradual increases&#13;
should be allowed for when the Government feel that there is room for it and the system has provided results&#13;
in practice. This would also help to ensure that the proceeds can be absorbed and spent accordingly. This&#13;
will naturally have to be considered by the authorities, but it is extremely important that the fuel surcharge&#13;
can be adjusted in a flexible way. With the current high rate of inflation frequent increases might be&#13;
necessary to maintain the value of the fund in real terms.&#13;
36.   No counter-signatures for payments should be needed from the MOP or MOF since they would be&#13;
represented in the board anyway. The automatic release mechanisms is extremely important to assure an&#13;
uninterrupted cash flow and to encourage and get the necessary confidence from private contractors. Violation&#13;
of this principle may ultimately cause a cash-flow crisis for road contractors and actually bring down&#13;
rehabilitation and maintenance output.&#13;
Collection of user charges and initial revenues&#13;
37.    A simple arrangement for collection of the road user charges and transferring the proceeds to the&#13;
Road Fund account without delays should be established('"). The Yemen State Petroleum Company, which&#13;
is the sole distributor and supplier of petroleum fuels in Yemen, collects the existing fuel taxes for the&#13;
Govemment, and would also collect the fuel surcharges for the Road Fund which should be deposited directly&#13;
into an account in the Central Bank on a monthly basis. In addition, the vehicle fees now collected by&#13;
Customs would also be deposited in the Road Fund account. Initially, it is proposed that a YR 0.5/liter&#13;
surcharge be put on petrol only, together with a moderate increase in the heavy vehicle fee (Alternative 2 in&#13;
Table 8). This should generate about YR 900 million in additional revenues, and together with the existing&#13;
collections of about YR 300 million from vehicle registration and license fees, should result in about YR&#13;
1200 million being collected in the initial year of the Road Fund operation.&#13;
Auditing arrangements&#13;
38.    The accrual to and disbursement from the Road Fund's accounts should be subject to an independent&#13;
system of auditing and inspection. Good auditing procedures will be required so that there will be no&#13;
diversion of funds, and full transparency regarding all aspects of its operations and transactions. If the&#13;
(II)    This is extremely important in order to ensure the liquidity and flexibility of the Fund, and to ensure timely&#13;
payments to contractors so that the fund can operate in an efficient manner with optimal contract packages, and&#13;
wiLl not be brought into discredit due to erratic payment practice.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 14 of 14&#13;
proceeds from the Road Fund should be diverted into other projects, this would undermine the confidence&#13;
in the system, and whatever support that would have been gained from road users might be lost. Annual&#13;
auditing can be carried out by a private accountant office in Sana'a.&#13;

ROAD SECTOR DEVELOPMENT POLICIES AND ACTIONS&#13;
Sirs,&#13;
This is to confirm the Government of Yemen's policy in the&#13;
roads sector and its commitment to undertaking actions to enhance&#13;
efficiency in the sector. The policy issues that we believe need&#13;
to be addressed in the sector are: (a) cost recovery from road&#13;
users and increased funding of road maintenance from road user&#13;
charges; and (b) truck overloading and lack of controls on&#13;
excessive axle loads.&#13;
With regard to cost recovery in the roads sector and funding&#13;
of road maintenance, it is the Covernment's policy to achieve&#13;
full cost recovery through a system of road user charges&#13;
implemented  in a phased  manner, ard  to  ensure  that  road&#13;
maintenance  is adequately funded.   in the period prior to&#13;
achieving full cost recovery, the Government would allocate funds&#13;
from the general budgat to cover the short fall in revenues from&#13;
road user charges. With respect to the problem of truck&#13;
overloading, it is the Government's policy to control axle loads,&#13;
and to establish and maintain the necessary facilities to&#13;
effectively enforce the axle load regulations-  In furth--ance&#13;
of these policies, the Government will undertake the actions set&#13;
out below.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN&#13;
TRANSPORT REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Civil Aviation Sector&#13;
1.    As in the case of the roads sector, the civil aviation sector now comprises a mix of the systems that&#13;
existed, prior to unification of the country, in the Civil Aviation Department (CAD) of the former PDRY,&#13;
and in the Civil Aviation and Meteorological Authority (CAMA) of the former YAR. The scope of&#13;
operations, assets and organization of the present CAMA, which absorbed CAD at unification, have&#13;
undergone radical changes first as a result of unification (1990), more recently as a result of the Gulf crisis&#13;
(1991), and finally due to the civil war (May-June, 1994) in which considerable damages were suffered at&#13;
Aden International Airport (AIA).&#13;
2.     Following unification in 1990, CAMA became responsible for the combined airspace of the unified&#13;
country, and given the vast geographical extent of the former PDRY, this was a considerable expansion in&#13;
the airspace controlled by CAMA. It also absorbed a large number of staff of the former CAD whose policy&#13;
had been to carry out most works using its own staff, whereas CAMA relied to a far greater extent on&#13;
contracting. CAMA also acquired from CAD a completely different mix of equipment, much of it supplied&#13;
from eastern bloc sources, which caused difficulties in obtaining spares, inter-operability and maintenance.&#13;
The Gulf crisis in 1991 precipitated another major change; up until then Saudi Arabia had been supporting&#13;
all air traffic services in the northern Governorates, and controlling the upper airspace from Jeddah. When&#13;
relations with Saudi Arabia deteriorated during the Gulf crisis, the Saudis withdrew their support, and the&#13;
entire responsibility, and financial burden, of managing the northern airspace fell on CAMA. The most&#13;
recent crisis, further strained CAMA due to the large losses of equipment and facilities suffered at AIA&#13;
which had become the primary base for air traffic services following the withdrawal of Saudi assistance.&#13;
These events have resulted in a considerably weakened sector significantly compromising civil aviation safety&#13;
in the country. The Civil Aviation National Plan-2005 (CANP-2005), prepared by international consultants&#13;
under European Union assistance in 1992 (prior to the most recent crisis), had identified numerous critical&#13;
deficiencies in the sector, and the losses suffered in the civil war have now exacerbated what was already&#13;
a difficult situation.&#13;
A.    Air Traffic and Forecasts&#13;
3.    CANP-2005 undertook an extensive assessment of past air traffic trends and prospects for the future,&#13;
for the 5 international and 14 domestic airports in the country. Table 3.1 below summarizes the findings&#13;
and forecasts, with the exception of data for 1993 and 1994 which were provided by CAMA. In 1990,&#13;
Sana'a handled 52% of total passenger traffic while Aden had 21 %. Results for 1994 were depressed in&#13;
general, owing to the civil war, and this was especially true for Aden which suffered a 10% drop in traffic.&#13;
Forecasts made in CANP-2005 expect the relative shares of the major airports to remain relatively stable,&#13;
with Aden registering a slightly higher growth rate and doubling its passenger traffic to almost 500,000&#13;
passengers by the year 2005. Whereas over the next ten years, passenger traffic in the country as a whole&#13;
is projected to grow at between 4 and 5% p.a., Aden's traffic is projected to grow at between 5 and 6%&#13;
p.a., while Sana'a's is expected to grow at between 3 and 4%. This reflects the expectation that Aden's&#13;
development as a regional trade centre will spur growth in air traffic.&#13;

B.    Civil Aviation Services&#13;
4.    As discussed above air traffic services provided by CAMA have undergone significant changes in&#13;
recent years.  The CANP-2005 review  found a number of deficiencies in air traffic services.&#13;
Communications equipment was found to have limited coverage, was generally obsolete and lacking spares&#13;
(in many cases the spares are no longer obtainable), and had inadequate emergency power supplies at many&#13;
locations; at Aden the emergency generator was found to take 30 minutes to start. The situation with regard&#13;
to navigational aids (navaids) is similar, for instance, the ILS at Sana'a airport is considered to have a&#13;
reliability of about 40 percent; glide slope indicators at Sana'a need adjustment; and at Taiz there are no&#13;
approach lights. CANP-2005 prioritization of investment needs placed most of the communications&#13;
equipment and navigational aids requirements in the Priority 1 category. Equipment losses suffered at Aden&#13;
during the crisis, has increased the urgency for replacement of navigational and communications equipment&#13;
at Aden International Airport.&#13;
5.    By and large, the CANP-2005 review found airport facilities more satisfactory than was the case for&#13;
air traffic services and navaids. Deficiencies identified that merited a Priority 1 rating, were mainly with&#13;
regard to runway marking and lighting, and the latter are now being addressed under French bilateral&#13;
assistance. In the longer term, runway extensions are recommended for some airports (eg. Sana'a) to&#13;
accommodate larger aircraft. At Aden the control tower was found deficient because the civil apron in front&#13;
of the terminal is not visible from the tower. Since the CANP-2005 study was completed in 1992, Aden&#13;
suffered considerable damage in the recent crisis when many facilities at the airport were hit including the&#13;
international terminal, runway and the tower.&#13;
C.    CAMA Organization&#13;
6.    CAMA is an autonomous agency, under the direct responsibility of the Minister of Transport. Its&#13;
ten member Board of Directors includes senior managers of CAMA, one representative each from the&#13;
Ministry of Transport and the Air Force, and the Chairman of the national airline. The Chairman of CAMA&#13;
has executive responsibility for running CAMA, and is also Chairman of the Board. The Board functions&#13;
largely as a management committee rather than as a body which exercises oversight over the management&#13;
function.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
44                                                                                 Page 3 of 7&#13;
7.    CAMA expects to lose many senior staff in the next five years when the staff occupying senior&#13;
positions retire. Low civil service salaries makes it difficult for CAMA to recruit and retain qualified&#13;
personnel. An experienced CAMA technician earns a third to one half the salary of a similarly qualified&#13;
technician working for the national airline, which has a special arrangement allowing much higher salary&#13;
scales. CAMA also loses trained technicians to the oil companies working in Yemen, who have a need for&#13;
trained electronics technicians. CAMA's two training institutes at Sana'a and Aden, once considered a&#13;
possible regional training site, are now barely functional.&#13;
D.    CAMA Financial Condition&#13;
8.    CAMA's financial condition is precarious, and presently its revenues barely suffice to pay for&#13;
salaries and the agency is dependent on Government subsidies to cover a bare minimum of operating&#13;
expenses. It is dependent on donor/Government funding for all its development expenditures, and even items&#13;
such as spare parts and paint for marking runways often need to be funded by donors. The reasons for&#13;
CAMA's weak financial condition include:&#13;
(a)    Low tariffs - a revision of CAMA's tariffs is now under consideration, however, even with&#13;
the tariff increase CAMA revenues will recover only two thirds of its expenditures;&#13;
(b)    Overstaffing primarily due to the absorption of large numbers of CAD staff;&#13;
(c)    Non-payment or delayed payment by the national carriers who now owe CAMA the&#13;
equivalent of a year's worth of CAMA revenues;&#13;
(d)    Loss of significant overflight revenues due to inadequacies in billing and financial systems;&#13;
and,&#13;
(e)    Arrangements whereby the national carriers pay CAMA only a small portion of ground&#13;
services charges.&#13;
CAMA's income statements for FY93, FY94, and estimates/projections for the years 1995, 2000, 2005 are&#13;
attached. The projections are made for two scenarios - retaining the present tariff and with the increased&#13;
tariff now under consideration. Even with the increased tariff, CAMA continues to make losses. It has been&#13;
found worldwide, that operating airports can be profitable, and CAMA's failure to recover costs can only&#13;
be the result of policy choices made explicitly or by default.&#13;
E.    Institutional Development&#13;
9.    In view of the present incomplete understanding of the constraints and options the civil aviation&#13;
sector faces from an institutional development standpoint, it is advisable that, as a first step, an institutional&#13;
development strategy and policy study be undertaken. Such a study would review the current situation,&#13;
identify options and recommend a course of action with regard to a number of policy areas such as role of&#13;
the private sector, organizational structure, tariff setting and financing, responsibility for negotiating bilateral&#13;
air transport agreements, staffing and training, remuneration, etc., all of which crucially impact on the&#13;
sector's ability to deliver safe and cost-effective air transport services, without burdening the government&#13;
with having to finance large deficits in CAMA's budget. The proposed project therefore includes a&#13;
component to finance such a study.&#13;

Re;TRANSPORT REHABILITATIlU PROECT&#13;
Civil Aviatiob yolicy&#13;
Sirs,&#13;
1. 'This is to confirm the Government of Yemen's commitment to&#13;
undertaking policy actions to correct various distortions and&#13;
inefficiencies presently affecting the civil aviation sector in the&#13;
country. Key policy issuea identified in the sectors are set out below;&#13;
a)   Extremely low cost recovery from users resulting in the Civil&#13;
Aviation and Mneteorological Authority (CAMA) recovering only about&#13;
35% of its costs from its own revenues and having to rely on&#13;
subsidies from the general budget;&#13;
b)   Excessive overstaffing of CAHiA. with considrable surplua in&#13;
unskilled prsonnel while there is an acute shortage of mechnical&#13;
personnel due to the inability of CAIiA to pay competitive salaries&#13;
for skilled staff; and&#13;
c)   A need to rationalize aviation infrastructure both to reduce&#13;
redundant facilities which have resulted from the unification of&#13;
the country, as well as to replace obsolete and unserviceable&#13;
equipment particularly those affecting the safety of aviation&#13;
operations in the country.&#13;
In order to address the above issues, the Government wishes to initiate&#13;
some actions the need for which are self evident, and to undrzake&#13;
studies to indentify options with regard to other areas where it is less&#13;
clear what the optimal course of action should be.&#13;
2.   It is evident that an intial tatiff increase as requested by CAMA&#13;
is needed immediately to reduce the large deficit now being incurred on&#13;
account of civil aviation by the Government. This tariff increase will&#13;
reduce CAMA's projected deficit for 1996 from about YR2SO million to&#13;
about Y1T150 million and improve cost recovery to about 70%. Furrher&#13;
tariff increases will be needed but the tariff structure will need to&#13;
be fine tuned to take into consideration the commercial situation in&#13;
various tariff segments. Such a fine tuning of the tariff structure&#13;
will be undertaken within the Civil Aviation Strategy and Policy Study&#13;
to be undrtaken urnder the subject credit, and the tariff enhancement&#13;
and cost reduction recommendations of the study will be implemented to&#13;
achieve full cost rcoe   i      Zition eostr    = _  __   _ _&#13;

The timing of thiz traiff increaze and the cost reduction measures will&#13;
be agreed during the mid-term review of the project which is scheduled&#13;
to occur before december 31,i995.&#13;
3.  Further, the Government would like to confirm its commitment to the&#13;
following three general principles for the civil aviation sector in&#13;
Yemen:&#13;
a)  that civil aviation as a sector should not receive any subsidies&#13;
from the general budget and that the Civil Aviation and&#13;
Mieteorological Authority (CAMA) should finance all operations,&#13;
mainrenance and development expenditures from its own revenues; and&#13;
b)  commercial activities that generate their own revenues, such as&#13;
various terminal operations at airports, should be privatizec.&#13;
In implementing the Civil Aviation Strategy and Policy Study. The&#13;
Government will seek ways to implement these general principles in&#13;
formulating a strategy for civil aviation development in the country.&#13;
4.  We believe the above course of action will lead to significant&#13;
improvements in the efficiency and safety of civil aviation operations&#13;
in the country.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN&#13;
TRANSPORT REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Project Description&#13;
1.    As the project involves two separate implementing agencies it has been sub-divided in two parts,&#13;
one for each agency, each to be implemented independently of the other.&#13;
2.    Part A: Ministry of Construction, Housing and Urban Planning would implement this part,&#13;
which includes the following components:&#13;
Road Rehabilitation&#13;
(a)    Hodeidah - Salif Road (US$10.3 million)('):  A 65 km section of this road which&#13;
connects the Port of Salif to the main road network at Hodeidah, is presently in very poor&#13;
condition. It was originally constructed as a gravel road with a thin bituminous surface treatment.&#13;
Heavy vehicle traffic associated with development of the Port of Salif for bulk cargoes, has caused&#13;
the road to deteriorate, and now the road requires reconstruction in parts and an AC overlay of&#13;
the remainder, to accommodate the increases in traffic expected with the completion of the major&#13;
grain handling port now under construction at Salif. The road also carries bulk traffic generated&#13;
by the Yemen Salt &amp; Gypsum Co. which produces or imports about 500,000 tons of gypsum,&#13;
cement and salt at its facilities in Salif. Presently, traffic on the road is about 660 vehicles per&#13;
day on average.&#13;
(b)    Am Ayn - Naqabah Road (US$10.0 million): This component finances rehabilitation&#13;
of the northeastern 100 km of this road, with the southern section being rehabilitated by GCRB&#13;
with financing from the Government. The road section is in poor condition and will require&#13;
reconstruction over a considerable portion of its length and resurfacing/overlays on the remainder.&#13;
The road is the main link between Aden and Mukalla and carries all of the traffic between the&#13;
eastern region and the rest of the country. Presently, traffic volumes average about 1,200 vehicles&#13;
per day.&#13;
Road Maintenance Fund/Yemen Road Fund Board&#13;
(c)   Institutional Development Technical Assistance to the Yemen Road Fund Board&#13;
(US$0.74 million): Technical assistance would be provided to assist the Government in&#13;
establishing the new Road Maintenance Fund and the associated technical office to manage the&#13;
highway system including road maintenance and the Road Maintenance Fund. This component&#13;
would also assist in commercializing GCRB's and PCRC's construction and maintenance&#13;
operations by improving its cost accounting system to enable full costing in the execution and&#13;
planning of works. This would assist the Government in determining how efficient and&#13;
competitive GCRB and PCRC are in relation to the private sector road construction and&#13;
maintenance contractors. Draft TOR for this component has been reviewed by IDA.&#13;
a     These are total base costs including the Government's contribution.&#13;
&#13;

Annex 6&#13;
Page 2 of 5                                                                          52&#13;
(d)    Equipment, Software and Installation of a Maintenance Planning, Programming and&#13;
Budgeting System (US$2.0 million): The capacity both at the central and govemorate level for&#13;
determining maintenance needs based on regular condition surveys of the main road network is&#13;
extremely weak. Strengthening this capacity will require equipment such as Bump Integrator,&#13;
Falling Weight Deflectometers, Dynamic Cone Penetrometers, etc. It would also require&#13;
computers, software and the setting up of the system including associated training to make it&#13;
operational. Establishment of such a system will require actions both at the Office of the National&#13;
Highways Board and at the local level in the Maintenance Departments in each Govemorate. The&#13;
project will finance a contract under which an international firm will provide a comprehensive&#13;
package of support, mainly in the form of supply of necessary equipment and associated systems&#13;
needed to implement the system. TORs for this consultancy contract has been reviewed by IDA.&#13;
(e)    Study for Planning &amp; Prioritizing Maintenance Needs (US$1.5 million): In view of&#13;
the poor performance in the area of road maintenance, the Government recently embarked on an&#13;
effort to improve planning and implementation of maintenance works for the main road network.&#13;
A study of maintenance needs for 2000 km (out of 5000 km of main roads) of "poor" and "fair"&#13;
condition roads is to be financed under the project. The study will inventory the existing&#13;
condition of the network, prioritized maintenance needs and develop detailed designs for&#13;
rehabilitation of the worst 800 kms. Rehabilitation works would be financed by the Road&#13;
Maintenance Fund (see above).&#13;
(f)   Implementation Supervision Consultants (US$1.5 million): Technical assistancewould&#13;
also be provided for construction supervision and supervision of the above project components.&#13;
A Project Implementation Unit, supported by the supervision consultants, would be established under the&#13;
Ministry of Construction, Housing and Urban Planning to oversee the components in Part A of the project.&#13;
3.    Part B: Civil Aviation and Meteorological Authority would implement Part B, which mainly&#13;
comprises emergency reconstruction and technical assistance:&#13;
Emergency Rehabilitation of the Aden International Airport&#13;
(a)    Aden International Airport Terminal Reconstruction (US$7.0 million): The AIA&#13;
Terminal, which was constructed in 1986, was bombed during the civil war (May-June 1994).&#13;
The damages include about 15 percent of the civil works structures, all of the services such as the&#13;
air conditioning system, electrical system, passenger information system, baggage handling system,&#13;
etc. An assessment of the damages made by the international consultants who originally designed&#13;
the terminal has estimated the reconstruction costs. Detailed engineering of reconstruction works&#13;
is needed and is provided for under the technical assistance component (see below).&#13;
(b)    New Control Tower and Technical Building at AIA (US$6.0 million): The existing&#13;
tower and technical buildings are old and have been slated for replacement for some time. These&#13;
buildings, and the communications/navaids equipment and their repair facilities housed there, also&#13;
suffered considerable damage during the civil war. Detailed design and bidding documents for&#13;
the new tower and technical building have been prepared under French bilateral assistance, and&#13;
France has expressed its willingness to finance the equipment and related training, provided&#13;
Government arranges for construction of the tower and technical building. This project would&#13;
finance the civil works, including all building services, so as to provide completed buildings&#13;
adequate to receive the equipment (worth about US$5.0 million) to be provided under French&#13;
bilateral assistance.&#13;
&#13;

Equipment&#13;
(c)    Communications and Navaids Equipment (US$5.0 million): The Control Tower and&#13;
Technical Building. Cofinancing for this equipment would need to be available by December 31,&#13;
1996.&#13;
(d)   Fire Fighting Equipment for AIA (US$1.0 million):  The project would include a&#13;
component to finance a fire fighting vehicle with accessories and spare parts for the Aden&#13;
International Airport to replace equipment that was damaged and lost during the civil war.&#13;
Technical Assistance&#13;
(e)    Civil Aviation Strategy and Policy Study (US$0.5 million): Since unification of the&#13;
country in 1990, the former Civil Aviation Department in the south was merged with the&#13;
autonomous Civil Aviation and Meteorological Authority in the north. The variances in policies&#13;
of these two organizations, as well as their various incompatibilities in respect of physical plant&#13;
and equipment, continue to pose difficulties for the management and future development of&#13;
CAMA. Additionally, CAMA faces financial difficulties due to over-staffing, low tariff levels and&#13;
delays in payment by the national airlines for services provided by CAMA. Under the project an&#13;
institutional development component will be financed to review these problems and formulate&#13;
appropriate policies. Draft TORs for this component has been reviewed by IDA.&#13;
(f)    Technical Assistance for Design and Supervision (US$1.5 million):  Design and&#13;
supervision of works would be financed under this TA component.&#13;
A Project Implementation Unit, supported by the supervision consultants, would be established at CAMA&#13;
headquarters in Sana'a to oversee all components under Part B of the project.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN&#13;
TRANSPORT REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Environmental Analysis and Actions&#13;
1.     Since the project comprises of roads rehabilitation works, reconstruction of the Aden Airport terminal&#13;
and procurement of equipment, it is not expected to have any major impact on the environment.&#13;
Reconstruction of the Aden Airport terminal building and control tower are not expected to have any&#13;
significant negative environmental impacts and have therefore been excluded from this environmental&#13;
analysis. The road works are rehabilitation and maintenance along existing road alignments and these would&#13;
be prepared incorporating environmental considerations at each stage from design to completion. This Annex&#13;
sets out the mitigatory measures that would be adopted in the road rehabilitation works.&#13;
2.     Road works financed under the project would include drainage improvement, and reconstruction&#13;
of base courses and asphalt concrete overlays. Road rehabilitation and periodic maintenance will involve&#13;
no realignment (or when they are necessary, realignment will be limited to very small curve correction, or&#13;
safety related blackspot treatment). Environmental issues in the road works component mainly concern&#13;
indirect impacts. Among the issues to be considered are: drainage, erosion, quarries, sand excavation,&#13;
disposal of waste materials, and damaging effects of asphalt mix plants. The magnitude and importance of&#13;
negative impacts, together with the improvement of environmental conditions and the traffic safety will&#13;
be assessed and specific mitigatory actions carried out during implementation, as set out in the Table below.&#13;
Impacts                             Location                            Mitigation measures&#13;
Soil erosion                Cleared areas adjacent to road      Replanting of cleared areas&#13;
Water pollution from        When crossing soils with limited    Proper storage, handling and&#13;
hazardous products used in  filter power or near sensitive      disposal of hazardous products road&#13;
works.                      water bodies.                       (including lubricating oils)&#13;
Soil contamination with                                          Proper storage, handling and&#13;
hazardous products used                                         disposal of hazardous products&#13;
Dust emissions during works    Residential areas                Watering.&#13;
Vibration due to explosive                                      Controlled use of explosives&#13;
Reduction of road users                                          Traffic management for traffic&#13;
safety                                                          diversion and construction vehicles&#13;
Wastes from old pavement                                        Reuse when feasible otherwise&#13;
materials                                                       dispose at appropriate site.&#13;
3.     The road works would include the adequate environmental improvements and mitigation measures&#13;
as set out in the Table below. Works contracts would include environmental clauses, including financial&#13;
guarantees, related to: location of borrow sites; location and management of stockpiling areas and work&#13;
depots; location and pollution control of concrete and asphalt plants; location of work camps and worker&#13;
&#13;

            Republic of Yemen - Transport
            Rehabilitation Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The primary objective of the Transport
            Rehabilitation Project is to rehabilitate critical
            components of the country's road and civil aviation
            infrastructure; secondarily, the project seeks to improve
            institutional capacity in these sectors for planning and
            maintenance of existing assets. As the project involves two
            separate implementing agencies - the Ministry of
            Construction, Housing and Urban Planning (MOC) and the Civil
            Aviation and Meteorological Authority (CAMA) - it is divided
            into two parts, one for each agency, each to be implemented
            independently of the other. MOC will implement the
            following: 1) Hodeidah-Salif, 65 km road rehabilitation; 2)
            Am Ayn-Naqabah, 100 km road rehabilitation; 3) equipment,
            software and training for maintenance planning; 4)
            assistance to the newly created Yemen Road Fund Board; 5)
            study for planning and prioritizing road maintenance needs
            and detailed design for rehabilitation of key highway links;
            and 6) implementation and construction supervision
            consultants. CAMA will implement: 1) Aden International
            Airport (AIA) terminal reconstruction; 2) new control tower
            and technical building at AIA; 3) communications/navaids
            equipment; 4) safety equipment; 5) civil aviation strategy
            and policy study; and 6) implementation, design and
            construction supervision.
