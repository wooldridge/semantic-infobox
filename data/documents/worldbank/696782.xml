PUBLIC SECTOR MODERNIZATION TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CREDIT&#13;
(PSMTAC)&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
SECTION A: PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    The proposed Public Sector Modernization Technical Assistance Credit (PSMTAC) is an&#13;
accompanying project to the proposed Public Sector Modernization Structural Adjustment Credit&#13;
(PSMSAC) that is being processed in parallel. These projects are designed to help the Govern-&#13;
ment implement its Public Sector Modernization Program (PSMP) which will: (a) improve public&#13;
services through greater private sector participation; (b) curtail expenditures through administra-&#13;
tive reform, including the restructuring of public administration and public employment; and (c)&#13;
improve public management to enhance efficiency, transparency, and accountability.&#13;
2.    The public sector is constituted by the Non-Financial and Financial Public Sector. The&#13;
Non-Financial Public Sector (NFPS) encompasses: (a) the Central Government, which includes&#13;
14 Secretariats, Centralized Services, the Legislative and Judicial Powers, the Electoral Body, and&#13;
the Office of the Attorney General; (b) the rest of General Government, which includes 51 public&#13;
institutes, 11 autonomous entities, five auxiliary organisms of the Legislative Power, one auxiliary&#13;
organism of the Judicial System, and the local Government with 292 Municipalities; and (c) the&#13;
entrepreneurial public sector with 10 Public Enterprises. The FPS, in turn, is made up of seven&#13;
financial organizations.&#13;
3.    As a result of this extended institutional structure, 1993 public expenditures (28.6% of&#13;
GDP for central government and 35.8% for NFPS) are far above the average for both low- and&#13;
middle-income countries. Current operating expenses (wages and salaries, social security&#13;
contributions, and goods and services) account for one third of NFPS spending, with public-&#13;
sector employment alone amounting to 8.2% of GDP. On top of that, Honduras has one of the&#13;
largest investment programs in the region (14.6% of GDP).&#13;
4.    Honduras' fiscal revenues compare favorably to other countries in the region, but its&#13;
public spending does not. At 28.6% for central government and 35.8% for NFPS, public&#13;
expenditures are far above the average for both low- and middle-income countries (1993).&#13;
Current operating expenses (wages and salaries, social security contributions, and goods and&#13;
services) account for one-third of NFPS spending, with public-sector employment alone&#13;
amounting to 8.2% of GDP. On top of that, Honduras has one of the largest public investment&#13;
programs in the region (14.6% of GDP).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
5.    Central government accounts for 62.3% of the consolidated NFPS total expenditures (or&#13;
22.7% of GDP) and the four biggest public enterprises for another 14.5% (or 5.3% of GDP) .&#13;
Spending by local government, social security and other institutions (rest of the general govern-&#13;
ment) account for the remainder (8.4% of GDP). In terms of capital spending, central government&#13;
still accounts for almost half&#13;
6.    In addition to the mere size of public expenditures, the complex and overextended&#13;
structure of the public sector is ill-equipped to respond to the needs and priorities of the country.&#13;
A series of distortions exists both in the definition of responsibilities and the size of the State, as&#13;
well as in the quantity and composition of staff that are needed to carry them out. Many of the&#13;
activities that the Government gradually undertook are now obsolete, better served by the private&#13;
sector, or are now centralized and can be more efficiently carried out by the regional offices&#13;
and/or the local governments. Moreover, the public sector faces serious organizational problems&#13;
including lack of functional coordination between public entities and overlapping of activities, and&#13;
very large administrative costs relative to program costs. The latter is due to the high level of&#13;
bureaucratization and organization disarray. The problem is compounded by a lack of expenditure&#13;
control resulting from poor public management. In addition, the legal system has been unable to&#13;
cope with the growth of government in an organized manner. Legal instruments have been added&#13;
incrementally without a consistent conceptual framework for organizing the public sector.&#13;
7.    In the Executive branch, there are about 122,000 permanent posts (at January 1994). Of&#13;
these, 35,000 are under the Civil Service and neighboring regimes, 35,000 are in-post teachers,&#13;
25,000 are in the Decentralized Institutions, 7,000 are in the Municipalities, and around 20,000&#13;
are military and administrative staff of the Secretariat of Defense. Of the 102,000 non-military&#13;
positions in 1994, 88,000 (or 86%) are in the general government (non-entrepreneurial), which&#13;
means that too much employment is attached to general government activities.&#13;
8.    The public sector is overstaffed, particularly at the lower end of the salary scale. Moreo-&#13;
ver, the wage bill represents a heavy fiscal burden - NFPS wages and salaries represent 8.2% of&#13;
GDP. This compares unfavorably with other LAC countries (El Salvador, 6.4%; Nicaragua,&#13;
6.6%; Venezuela, 4.8%; Mexico, 7.4%; and Dominican Republic, 3%. Only Panama and Costa&#13;
Rica have higher ratios than Honduras (10.5% and 8.6%, respectively). At the same time, wages&#13;
are low and falling in real terms, particularly for higher grade staff, and this has hampered the&#13;
Government's ability to attract and retain top-notch personnel. Incentive structures are inadequate&#13;
and human resource management is weak.&#13;
ONGOING PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM&#13;
9.    Under the Government's PSMP, being supported by the PSMSAC and accompanying&#13;
PSMTAC, the State will be limited to those functions that are proper of the public sector,&#13;
eliminating obsolete and redundant functions and removing from the responsibility of the State&#13;
those that can be better served by other agents. This will be accompanied by staff reduction,&#13;
improvement in its composition, and selective decompression of salaries. The general aim of the&#13;
program is to develop an efficient public sector, balanced in its finances, responsive to the needs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
of society for quality services, in an environment conducive to private sector development and&#13;
growth.&#13;
10.   The Government has made significant progress throughout 1994 and 1995 in implement-&#13;
ing its PSMP, complementing it with measures on the revenue side. The Executive Secretariat of&#13;
the Presidential Commission for the Modernization of the State (CPME) was created in 1992 with&#13;
the legal authority to design, coordinate, and monitor the execution of the reform. The PSMP has&#13;
the support of both the executive (approval of the Council of Ministers), and legislative branches:&#13;
Congress passed the "Law of Restructuring of Public Sector Revenue Mechanisms and Expendi-&#13;
ture Reduction" on October 28, 1994. The Law authorizes several measures to curtail expendi-&#13;
tures and increase tax revenues.&#13;
11.   The Government also established the Consultative Commission for Privatization, and&#13;
publicly announced its intention to open telecommunications to the private sector. The new&#13;
Framework Law for the Telecommunications Sector including the amendments to the Hondutel&#13;
Organic Law was approved by Congress on October 31, 1995. In civil aviation, the Government&#13;
has presented to Congress the draft of the Civil Aviation Law and the Law for the Honduran&#13;
Enterprise of Airports and Air Navigation Services, which would create an appropriate regulatory&#13;
framework, decentralize enterprise airport management, and substantially increase private sector&#13;
participation in airport management. In energy, the Congress approved the new Law of the&#13;
Electricity Subsector in November 1994, which has led to the opening of the power sector to&#13;
private sector participation and financing, particularly in the area of generation.&#13;
12.   On administrative reform, the Government has presented to Congress the new General&#13;
Law of Public Administration, which establishes the new structure and composition of the central&#13;
and decentralized administrations, develops the bases for further administrative reform, and&#13;
establishes standards of transparency and accountability for public management. Moreover, under&#13;
the supervision of the CPME, institutional restructuring plans have been developed for all the&#13;
central government Secretariats covered under the PSMP and a number of Secretariats have&#13;
begun implementing them. As a result, major departments have been eliminated from the&#13;
Secretariats of Finance, Communications, Public Works &amp; Transport, Natural Resources, and&#13;
Government &amp; Justice, as reflected in the 1995 budget. Plans have been approved for restructur-&#13;
ing some decentralized institutions and implementation has begun.&#13;
13.   The Congress has also authorized key actions for the establishment of a decentralized&#13;
system of procurement, including the elimination of the Central Procurement Office's operations,&#13;
the transfer of responsibility to each public entity, and the approval of a plan to simplify procure-&#13;
ment procedures. In addition, plans are being prepared for the establishment of a comprehensive&#13;
system for human resource management and integrated systems of financial management and&#13;
investment programming.&#13;
14.   On the revenue side, a number of important actions have been taken including the&#13;
derogation of the Temporary Import Regime, the establishment of a 1% asset tax, the expansion&#13;
of the sales tax base, the valuation, for tax purpose, of ali imports at market exchange rate, and an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
increase in gasoline prices and electricity rates. Tax measures are estimated to have increased&#13;
revenues in 1995 by 0.6% of GDP. The Government has also eliminated coffee, cement and flour&#13;
subsidies and reduced the subsidy on petroleum, for an equivalent 1.6% of GDP.&#13;
PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
15.   The design of the PSMP is based on a profound rethinking of the role of the State in the&#13;
economy, which should result in increased private sector participation in the provision of public&#13;
goods and services. The objectives of the proposed PSMTAC are to provide (a) policy formula-&#13;
tion support that the Government needs to design reforms under its PSMP, (b) implementation&#13;
support to develop the means and information necessary for the reform process and to comply&#13;
with the conditions and action plans under the PSMSAC, and to modernize human resource&#13;
management, financial management and public procurement systems, and (c) institutional&#13;
strengthening support to the entities that will be beneficiaries of these management systems. A&#13;
PPF advance of US$0.7 million (P842-HO) has been supporting start-up activities of the&#13;
proposed PSMTAC.&#13;
PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
16.   The PSMTAC will provide the informational, analytical and legal bases for the reform&#13;
program supported by PSMSAC, as well as assistance to strengthen the Government's capacity to&#13;
implement both the adjustment program and the longer term public sector modernization strategy.&#13;
The main tools of the project are: (a) development of strategies to enhance the institutional and&#13;
organizational framework; (b) design of laws, regulations, methods and procedures; (c) design&#13;
and implementation of macro management systems; and (d) training of technical staff in the&#13;
regulatory, institutional and operational aspects of the reform. The areas to be covered under the&#13;
PSMTAC are: Private Sector Participation in Public Services, Administrative Reform, and&#13;
Reform of Public Management.&#13;
Private Sector Participation in Public Services Component (Estimated US$3.8 million,&#13;
23.5% of project costs)'&#13;
17.   Issues. A small number of public enterprises in the utilities and infrastructure sectors&#13;
account for a large proportion of public debt and investment, operate as monopolies, are&#13;
inefficient and overstaffed, and are insufficiently capitalized to respond to demand. Increased&#13;
private sector participation will increase fiscal revenues, reduce public investment requirements,&#13;
decrease external debt, and induce larger new investment (private).&#13;
18.   The Government's Reform Program. The Government's privatization plan is based on a&#13;
modem concept of the State that increases private sector share and participation in the economy,&#13;
and replaces state monopolies with regulated competitive environments. In telecommunications,&#13;
consultants financed under the PPF assisted the work of the Privatization Consultative Commis-&#13;
' Figures in parentheses represent the estimated base cost of the component, including IDA and IDB- financed assistance, and&#13;
Government contribution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
sion (CCP) in preparing the strategy for increasing private sector participation, competition and&#13;
efficiency in telecommunications. Key to the strategy is the development of an appropriate&#13;
institutional framework that separates the functions of policy, regulation, and operation - now&#13;
concentrated in the state telecommunication company (Hondutel). The Secretariat of Communi-&#13;
cations, Public Works and Transport (SECOPT) will be responsible for policy in the sector. The&#13;
legislation needed to implement this strategy was already approved by Congress-a condition for&#13;
PSMSAC Board presentation-on October 30, 1995. In addition, in order to attract private&#13;
investment, the Government will rebalance tariffs, through a substantial increase in the price of&#13;
local services to make up for lower international rates.&#13;
19.   It is expected that in the next six months the regulatory entity will be fully operational so&#13;
that, by the end of 1996, both the relevant regulations, and tariff regime will have been approved,&#13;
the final bidding documents for basic phone services issued. By the end of 1997, management of&#13;
basic phone services will have been transferred to one or more private operators through a long-&#13;
term concession. All other telecommunication services should be open to competition from the&#13;
start.&#13;
20.   In civil aviation, the Government has presented to Congress the Civil Aviation Law and&#13;
the Law for the Honduran Enterprise of Airports and Air Navigation Services - a condition for&#13;
PSMSAC Board presentation. These laws incorporate the Government's strategy for restructur-&#13;
ing the civil aviation sector, which entails decentralizing the General Directorate of Civil Aviation&#13;
(DGAC) from SECOPT, creating an autonomous regulatory entity, establishing a public&#13;
autonomous enterprise to operate the airports and air navigation services, and substantially&#13;
increasing private sector participation in airport operations.&#13;
21. As a measure to expedite the concessions of airport services, Congress approved on December 19,&#13;
1995 the Ley de Concesi6n para la Explotaci6n de los Servicios Aeroportuarios (Concession Law for&#13;
the Exploitation of Airport Services) which authorizes the Executive Branch, through SECOPT, to&#13;
extend concession contracts to manage, administer, and commercially develop the national airports. It&#13;
is expected that contracting of services for the airports of San Pedro Sula and Roatan will start early&#13;
next year, in compliance with second tranche conditions. Approval of the Civil Aviation Law and the&#13;
Law for the Honduran Enterprise of Airport and Air Navigation Services, and the establishment of the&#13;
regulatory entity and the enterprise, would provide a more integrated framework for the sector.&#13;
22.   Proposed Assistance under the PSMTAC. The Private Sector Participation in Public&#13;
Services Component will provide assistance in three sectors: telecommunications and civil&#13;
aviation, as supported under the PSMSAC, and ports. In telecommunications, the PSMTAC will&#13;
assist the Government in developing private sector participation in that sector. In civil aviation,&#13;
the PSMTAC will continue the work initiated under the Transport Rehabilitation Project (Cr.&#13;
2458-HDS) in restructuring the civil aviation sector. And in ports, although the sector does not&#13;
form part of the policy reforms of the PSMSAC, the PSMTAC will provide assistance in response&#13;
to the Government's interest in increasing private sector participation in ports operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
23.   Increasing Private Sector Participation in Telecommunications. The PSMTAC will&#13;
finance consulting services to help the Government develop private sector participation in the&#13;
telecommunications sector. Specifically, the PSMTAC will finance: (a) marketing the transaction;&#13;
(b) designing investment and quality of service obligations by new operator, (c) inventory and&#13;
valuation of assets/liabilities, (d) audit and restatement of financials in the US Internationally&#13;
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles; (e) financial projections of the new Corporation(s); (f)&#13;
preparation of the preliminary financial value of the new company(ies); (g) preparation and&#13;
negotiation of legal documents of the transaction; and (h) international bidding process. The final&#13;
bidding documents will be issued before PSMSAC second tranche release.&#13;
24.   Restructuring of the civil aviation sector.2 The PSMTAC will finance consulting services&#13;
and training to (a) help prepare rules and regulations of the Civil Aviation Law and the Law for&#13;
the Honduran Enterprise of Airports and Air Navigation Services; (b) assist in (i) the creation of&#13;
an autonomous normative regulatory entity, (ii) the creation of a public enterprise to manage&#13;
airports and operate auxiliary air navigation services, and (iii) the extension of concessions to&#13;
private operators for operating airport services; (c) prepare norms for selection and recruitment of&#13;
sectoral staff, and (d) develop and carry out a training program for technical and administrative&#13;
staff. GOH will extend a management concession for one airport or concession several airport&#13;
services in major national airports by PSMSAC second tranche release.&#13;
25.   Increasing of private sector participation in ports operations. The PSMTAC will finance&#13;
consulting services to (a) prepare a study that will evaluate different options for increasing private&#13;
sector participation in ports operations and its impact on ENP, the publicly-owned ports entity;&#13;
(b) help develop policies and define the participation of private operators in Puerto Cortes and&#13;
other ports, (c) help define the institutional role of the ENP (d) provide advice on restructuring&#13;
ENP, and (e) develop mechanisms for the participation of private operators.&#13;
26.   In addition, the IDB  will provide complementary technical assistance through its&#13;
Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF), to (a) establish new regulatory frameworks for the sectors,&#13;
(b) strengthen the regulation capabilities of autonomous/independent entities, and (c) strengthen&#13;
the regulation functions of a multisectoral entity. Specifically on telecommunications, MIF will&#13;
finance technical assistance to develop the legal framework and regulations, and establishment of&#13;
an independent and financially autonomous regulatory entity, CONATEL.&#13;
27.   Institutional Arrangements. The Executive Secretary of the CCP will serve as the head&#13;
of the Technical/Coordination Unit for the Private Sector Participation in Public Services&#13;
Component. The CCP will be responsible for coordinating consultants, who will work closely&#13;
with the CCP and the management and institutional counterparts of the three sectors. The bidding&#13;
and contracting for this component will be the responsibility of SHCP. The Project Coordinating&#13;
Unit (PCU), which will report to the CPME, will oversee contract completion and track&#13;
2     If Congress does not approve the Civil Aviation Law and the Law for the Honduran Enterprise of Airport and Air&#13;
Navigation Services (see para. 21), then this sub-component will need to be reformulated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
disbursements in coordination with the CCP. The PSMTAC will finance a long-term administra-&#13;
tive coordinator as well as office technology equipment.&#13;
Administrative Reform&#13;
28.   The area of Administrative Reform will cover two components: (a) Institutional Restruc-&#13;
turing Component, and (b) Honduran Social Security Institute and Social Security System&#13;
Component.&#13;
Institutional Restructuring Component (Estimated US$2.1 million, 13.2% of project&#13;
costs)&#13;
29.   Issues. The institutional structure of the Honduran public sector is characterized by a&#13;
multitude of entities with sometimes unclear and sometimes obsolete or duplicated mandates. This&#13;
engenders functional fragmentation, inefficiency, and a high fiscal burden.&#13;
30.   The Government's Reform  Program. The Government's program is based on a&#13;
redefinition of the role of the State where the State focuses on the formulation of policy and&#13;
provides an appropriate setting for the private sector provision of goods and services. Institutional&#13;
restructuring plans for targeted entities provide the mechanism for rationalizing the size of&#13;
Government, streamlining its activities, and improving efficiency in the delivery of public goods&#13;
and services.&#13;
31.   Under the supervision of CPME, institutional restructuring plans have been developed for&#13;
all the central government Secretariats covered under the PSMP with assistance from PPF-&#13;
financed consultants, and a number of Secretariats have begun implementing them. As a result,&#13;
major departments have been eliminated from the Secretariats of Finance, Communications,&#13;
Public Works &amp; Transport, Natural Resources, and Government &amp; Justice, as reflected in the&#13;
1995 budget. Plans have been approved for restructuring some decentralized institutions and&#13;
implementation has begun. Moreover, consultants financed under the PPF helped the Government&#13;
draft a new General Law of Public Administration, presented to Congress in October 1995 as a&#13;
condition for PSMSAC Board presentation.&#13;
32.   The implementation of institutional restructuring plans has resulted in a reduction of&#13;
permanent employment - over 3,500 posts in the Central and Decentralized Administrations -&#13;
and in other personnel expenditures. The Law of Restructuring requires some additional/broader&#13;
measures: freezing vacant posts during 1994 and 1995; about 5,300 permanent employment cuts&#13;
within 18 months from the date of Congressional approval; cancellation of the budget entry for&#13;
emergency and substitute staff, a hiring freeze on contracted staff financed with national funds;&#13;
and elimination of salary supplements paid to staff for performing extra-ordinary duties. These&#13;
measures include all decentralized institutions.&#13;
33.   Proposed Assistance under the PSMTAC. The objectives of the Institutional Restruc-&#13;
turing Component are to (a) support the preparation and implementation of institutional&#13;
restructuring plans in priority/selected entities as stated in the Administrative Reform of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
Government's PSMP supported by the PSMSAC; (b) strengthen selected entities' capacity to&#13;
design and implement policy; and (c) develop an adequate and consistent legal framework.&#13;
34.   Formulation of rationalization strategies for additional targeted entities. The PSMTAC&#13;
will finance consulting services to help the Government formulate institutional restructuring plans&#13;
in additional entities, including the Education Credit Institute (EDUCREDITO), National Institute&#13;
of Professional Formation (INFOP), Honduran Coffee Institute (IHCAFE), and Honduran Social&#13;
Investment Fund (FHIS).&#13;
35.   Implementation support of rationalization efforts. The PSMTAC will finance consulting&#13;
services, equipment and training to assist the entities implement their reforms; particular emphasis&#13;
will be given to the Secretariats of Education, Health, Communication, Public Works and&#13;
Transport, Natural Resources, and the Central Secretariats of economics and finance, and to the&#13;
National Board for Social Welfare/National Children's Organization (JNBS/PANI), according to&#13;
the action plans prepared by the Government for the PSMSAC.&#13;
36.   Strengthening of the technical capacity of the entities to design and implement priority&#13;
programs. The PSMTAC will finance consulting services to help the entities design standard&#13;
procedures and identify priority areas, and provide specialized training to selected staff. In&#13;
addition, the IDB will finance technical assistance for strengthening environment units in selected&#13;
Central Secretariats and Decentralized Institutions.&#13;
37.   Development of a consistent legal framework. The PSMTAC will finance consulting&#13;
services to update existing legal instrument or develop new ones, as needed.&#13;
38.   Institutional Arrangements. The PCU will be responsible for coordinating consultants,&#13;
who will work closely with the institutional counterparts and heads of sector, and regularly&#13;
discuss progress with the PCU. Each entity under the program will commit to developing an&#13;
institutional restructuring plan with the help of the consultants, and present it to the PCU for&#13;
approval. The PCU will ascertain that the plan responds to the objectives of the program and will&#13;
seek IDA/IDB advise before agreeing to its implementation. Each head of entity will be responsi-&#13;
ble for the timely implementation of the agreed plan.&#13;
Honduran Social Security Institute and Social Security System Component (Estimated&#13;
US$1.1 million, 6.6% of project costs)&#13;
39.   Issues. The Honduran social security system is characterized by inadequate funding which&#13;
is imperiling the solvency of the system; an heterogeneous and extended institutional framework&#13;
providing remarkably different levels of benefits to their affiliates; questionable financial practices;&#13;
poor performance; and limited coverage. The Social Security Institute (IHSS), the main institution&#13;
in the sector, is particularly affected by the low contributions to both its health and its pension&#13;
fund. Historically, this has led IHSS to rely on both funds to finance its health program, severely&#13;
affecting its ability to provide acceptable pensions to its affiliates. Coupled with IHSS' inadequate&#13;
cost and inventory accounting methods, a flawed procurement system, low technical capacity, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
high cost of health services provision, the financial problems have escalated to the point of&#13;
insolvency.&#13;
40.   The financial and managerial reform of IHSS will address the impending issue of financial&#13;
insolvency of the Institute as a first step in the reform of the social security system. The role of the&#13;
technical assistance is to help the Government design specific actions to mend short-term&#13;
problems as to allow sufficient time to implement a longer-term strategy for the sector. To ensure&#13;
consistency of these initial actions with an overall strategy, the technical assistance will provide&#13;
support for developing such a sector strategy in conjunction with the reform of IHSS, as well as&#13;
for establishing the links with the reform in the health sector.&#13;
41.   The Government's Reform Program. With assistance from local consultants financed&#13;
under the PPF, the Government has undertaken the determination of the actuarial basis for the&#13;
pension and health funds, and the basis for implementing the financial and managerial reform of&#13;
the IHSS. The design of the systems for budget, affiliation and collection, and identification and&#13;
monitoring of beneficiaries of the IHSS is underway.&#13;
42.   Proposed Assistance under the PSMTAC. The objectives of the Social Security&#13;
Institute and Social Security System Component are to: (a) support the preparation and imple-&#13;
mentation of the administrative and financial reform of IHSS; and (b) develop a strategy for social&#13;
security system reform.&#13;
43.   Strengthening of the Administration and Improvement of the Finances of IHSS. The&#13;
PSMTAC will finance consulting services, equipment and training to (a) update the Institute's&#13;
accounts of contributors and affiliates, (b) develop and implement a computerized system for&#13;
programming and budgeting, accounting, collections and payments, medical inventories, current&#13;
accounts of contributors and affiliates, and medical statistics, and (c) train IHSS' administrators&#13;
and technical staff.&#13;
44.   Development of a Social Security System Strategy. The PSMTAC will finance consulting&#13;
services to (a) carry out a diagnostic review of the pensions system and the provision of health&#13;
services, (b) prepare a cost analysis of the current system and possible future social security&#13;
schemes, and (c) prepare strategies for (i) reform of pensions and health systems, and (ii) develop&#13;
a system of professional risk insurance.&#13;
45.   Institutional Arrangements. The PCU will be responsible for coordinating consultants,&#13;
who will in turn coordinate with the Board of Directors of IHSS and work closely with IHSS'&#13;
management and key personnel. In the case of the reform of the social security system, the&#13;
consultants will work also with the other institutions in the sector and the CCP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
Reform of Public Management&#13;
Human Resource Management Component (Estimated US$2.5 million, 15.4% of&#13;
project costs)&#13;
46.   Reform  of Public Management will cover three components: (a) Human Resource&#13;
Management Component, (b) Integrated Financial Management and Investment Programming&#13;
Component, and (c) Public Procurement Component.&#13;
47.   Issues. The public sector is overstaffed, particularly at the lower end of the salary scale.&#13;
At the same time, wages are low and falling in real terms, particularly for higher grade staff, and&#13;
this has hampered the Government's ability to attract and retain top-notch personnel. Incentive&#13;
structures are inadequate and human resource management is weak. The classification and&#13;
grading of jobs do not take adequate account of skills and responsibility. Job evaluations, career&#13;
development, and training programs are non-existent. Given the lack of adequate incentives and&#13;
monitoring, and the politicization of hiring, morale among workers is low, and performance poor.&#13;
Moreover, as a result of inadequate control, absenteeism is high and some staff have no official&#13;
functions. Separate employment and salary regimes with preferential treatment have proliferated&#13;
without a normative framework, which hinders consistency in human resource management.&#13;
48.   The Government's Reform Program. To address these deficiencies, the Government's&#13;
strategy, being supported by the PSMSAC, includes employment reform and salary structure&#13;
rationalization in the civil service and decentralized institutions (teachers and medical doctors are&#13;
currently excluded from the rationalization), and a comprehensive human resource management&#13;
program across all public sector employment regimes and effective control mechanisms.&#13;
49.   With assistance from local consultants financed under the PPF, the Government has been&#13;
preparing institutional restructuring plans that identified employment reduction targets based on&#13;
institutional restructuring and employment rationalization (para. 34). The PPF is also financing the&#13;
development of a human resource management information system for the civil service. Moreo-&#13;
ver, PPF-financed consultants assisted the Government in carrying out diagnostic work of the civil&#13;
service and teachers' regimes, and in formulating recommendations for improvements at the&#13;
normative, institutional and operational levels.&#13;
50.   Proposed Assistance under the PSMTAC. The objectives of the Human Resource&#13;
Management Component are to improve information mechanisms to support human resource&#13;
management and control in an integrated manner, and develop the technical basis for pay reform&#13;
and improve employment and salary regimes at the normative, institutional and operational levels.&#13;
Moreover, the PSMTAC will support sector-specific technical assistance requirements of the&#13;
Secretariats of Education and Health.&#13;
51.   Development of information mechanisms to support human resource management and&#13;
control in an integrated manner. The PSMTAC will finance consulting services, equipment and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
training to (a) systematically monitor the payrolls of all public sector employment and salary&#13;
regimes of the Executive, (b) carry out, and establish a permanent system for, employment&#13;
censuses and payroll audits, (c) complete the implementation of a comprehensive human resource&#13;
management and payroll system, linked to the budget, which will encompass the civil service,&#13;
neighboring regimes including medical doctors, and all decentralized institutions,3 and extend the&#13;
system to all Secretariats and at least four decentralized institutions, and (d) extend the integrated&#13;
human resource management and payroll systems to all Secretariats and at least four decentralized&#13;
institutions.&#13;
52.   Development of the technical basis for pay reform, and improve the employment and&#13;
salary regimes at the normative, institutional and operational levels. The PSMTAC will finance&#13;
consulting services and training to (a) develop a strategy for improving the civil service regime at&#13;
the normative, institutional and operational levels, including recommendations for the normative&#13;
structure of neighboring regimes; (b) develop a new post classification and grading system, salary&#13;
structure and incentives plan, including (i) design of a salary policy, (ii) organizational study, (iii)&#13;
reclassification of posts, and (iv) development of a new salary structure; (c) develop a modem&#13;
human resource policy, including recruitment policies and selection criteria; (d) help amend the&#13;
civil service law, as necessary; and (e) strengthen the capabilities in human resource management&#13;
of the Civil Service Directorate (DGSC) and the central Secretariats. This assistance will support&#13;
the Government's action plan on reform of employment in the civil service regime of the central&#13;
Government and the Decentralized Institutions&#13;
53.   Strengthening of the Secretariat of Education's capacity to assess teacher post require-&#13;
ments. The PSMTAC will finance consulting services to assist SEP to strengthen its capacity to&#13;
assess teacher post requirements.&#13;
54.   Strengthening of the Secretariat of Health's capacity to evaluate human resources. The&#13;
PSMTAC will finance consulting services to assist the Secretariat of Health (SSP) to evaluate&#13;
human resource supply, training, development, deployment and performance in the health sector.&#13;
55.   Over the longer term, the Government plans to develop a system of career development&#13;
streams and offer comprehensive training programs as incentives to minimize staff turnover and&#13;
improve performance. For this purpose, IDA and IDB will seek financing from donors in the next&#13;
Consultative Group meeting, being considered by the Government.&#13;
56.   Institutional Arrangements. The PCU will be responsible for coordinating consultants,&#13;
who will work closely with key staff of the normative bodies in charge of managing and/or&#13;
monitoring human resources (DGSC) for the civil service regime, SHCP(DGID) for the decentral-&#13;
ized institutions, SEP for the teachers' regime, and SHCP(DGP) for the public sector in general.4&#13;
All consultants will regularly discuss progress with the PCU and with key personnel of normative&#13;
bodies. Because particularly the DGSC lacks the adequate technical capabilities needed to&#13;
3     The system for the Secretariat of Education will be financed under the Basic Education Project (Cr. 2694-HO)&#13;
4 The DGSC also has responsibility for the administration of the medical doctors' regime.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
effectively drive and coordinate the reform process, the assistance to that agency will focus&#13;
initially on providing it the guiding tools necessary to develop the various technical assistance&#13;
activities (human resource management systems, post classification, salary administration, etc.).&#13;
Specific institutional strengthening technical assistance inputs will be provided to build the&#13;
agency's capabilities to disseminate norms and procedures to the beneficiary entities.&#13;
Integrated Financial Management and Investment Programming Component&#13;
(estimated US$4.9 million, 30.2% of project costs)&#13;
57.   Issues. Financial management and investment programming are characterized by: (a) over-&#13;
centralization, particularly of the budget function; (b) an inadequate institutional framework; (c)&#13;
lack of an integrated financial management and investment programming information system; (d)&#13;
lack of underlying investment strategy and project evaluation capability; and (e) poor expenditure&#13;
monitoring and control.&#13;
58.   The Government's Reform  Program. This component, being supported by the&#13;
PSMSAC, seeks to reduce the overcentralization of public financial management, particularly of&#13;
budgetary allocation and execution, create an adequate institutional framework for modem&#13;
financial management and investment programming, and establish an integrated financial&#13;
management and investment programming information system. The role of the technical assistance&#13;
is to support the analysis and design of a modem framework, share the expertise gained in similar&#13;
reforms in other Latin American countries, and develop the technical and human resources that&#13;
will ensure efficiency and sustainability of the system. With PPF financing, the Government is&#13;
designing an integrated financial management system that will allow decentralized expenditure&#13;
execution, provide unified and timely information, and facilitate control.&#13;
59.   Proposed Assistance under the PSMTAC. The objectives of the Integrated Financial&#13;
Management and Investment Programming Component are: (a) establishing a participatory&#13;
mechanism for setting priorities and ensuring fiscal consistency; (b) decentralizing financial&#13;
management, particularly budget administration, and improving accountability; (c) introducing&#13;
incentives and performance evaluation systems to improve the effectiveness of public expendi-&#13;
tures, particularly for investments; (d) developing key financial management functions (such as&#13;
accounting and treasury), and redefining the budget function to ensure appropriate formulation,&#13;
execution and evaluation of the budget; and (e) designing and implementing a modern, integrated&#13;
financial management and investment programming information system, which will help rational-&#13;
ize the public investment program.&#13;
60.   Development and implementation of an integrated financial management system. The&#13;
PSMTAC will finance systems development, hardware and software to develop and implement an&#13;
integrated financial management system that will include accounting, treasury, budget and public&#13;
debt, and will be linked with human resource administration and payroll.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
61.   Development and implementation of an investment programming system. The PSMTfAC&#13;
will finance systems development, hardware and software to continue to develop and implement&#13;
an investment programming system, building on assistance already provided by IDB and UNDP.&#13;
62.   Design and development of modem methods and procedures to support fundamental&#13;
financial management functions. The PSMTAC will finance consulting services to design and&#13;
develop modem methods and procedures to support fundamental financial management functions&#13;
including: developing performance indicators to strengthen budget programming and evaluation;&#13;
attuning and further developing budgeting, accounting, treasury and public debt management;&#13;
strengthening the offices in charge of investment programming, monitoring and evaluation, and&#13;
ensuring consistency with the functions of the main authority on public finance; establishing&#13;
standard criteria of project evaluation and selection; and adopting a prioritization scheme&#13;
consistent with the overall program of reform.&#13;
63.   Development of a strategy to enhance/reorder the institutional setting and organizational&#13;
framework of financial management and investment programming. The PSMTAC will finance&#13;
consulting services to help establish mechanisms to set priorities and guide public expenditure&#13;
programming; decentralization of expenditure execution to operative units; establishment of&#13;
mechanisms for integrating public investment information to facilitate programming and monitor-&#13;
ing; and implementation of measures to ensure intertemporal consistency of the public investment&#13;
program with the overall fiscal program.&#13;
64.   Training. The PSMTAC will provide training of technical staff to develop or strengthen&#13;
the financial management units in each public entity and the investment programming units within&#13;
dependencies and entities responsible for the bulk of public investment.&#13;
65.   Institutional Arrangements. The PCU will be responsible for coordinating consultants,&#13;
who will work closely with the institutional counterparts in relevant implementing agencies.&#13;
Consultants will regularly discuss progress with the PCU. Initially, the reform will focus on the&#13;
Secretariat of Finance which will then participate in the coordination of efforts to extend the&#13;
system to other public entities. While the training plan will cover mainly operational issues, it may&#13;
be used as a forum to share important institutional and procedural aspects such as the develop-&#13;
ment of budget performance indicators and budget design.&#13;
Public Procurement Component (estimated US$0.5 miHion, 2.9% of project costs)&#13;
66.  Issues. Excessive centralization in procuring, distributing, and controlling public supplies&#13;
has made the system inefficient and ineffective. The inadequate legal framework and cumbersome&#13;
procedural setting has discouraged competition, encouraged discrimination against economic&#13;
agents, and limited the authority to executing units in purchasing supplies.&#13;
67.   The Government's Reform  Program. With the assistance from local consultants&#13;
financed under the PPF, the Government has designed and approved the implementation of a&#13;
decentralized system of public procurement. The Law of Restructuring stripped the Central&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
Procurement Office of all operative functions and transformed it into a small normative unit.&#13;
Responsibility for procurement was transferred to the executing entities. Preparation of amend-&#13;
ments to the Public Procurement Law to provide a sound basis for the institutional changes are&#13;
being financed through the PPF.&#13;
68.   Proposed Assistance under the PSMTAC. The objectives of the Modernization of&#13;
Public Procurement Component are to support the development of a modem decentralized system&#13;
of public procurement. This requires: (a) reforming the legal framework, (b) developing transpar-&#13;
ent administrative procedures to ensure equitable treatment of bidders and efficient procurement&#13;
of goods and services, and (c) helping implementing procurement units within each entity&#13;
strengthen their technical capacity.&#13;
69.   Reform of the legal framework. The PSMTAC will finance consulting services to help&#13;
develop clear and transparent administrative procedures and establish methodologies needed to&#13;
carry out an adequate register, organization and control of the operations within the new legal&#13;
framework.&#13;
70.   Development of norms for the selection of technical staff. The PSMTAC will finance&#13;
consulting services to help develop norms for selecting technical staff of the procurement units.&#13;
71.  Institutional strengthening of procurement unit&amp; The PSMTAC will provide training to&#13;
technical staff of centralized and decentralized entities responsible for procurement and bid&#13;
evaluation, as well as seminars on the legal-institutional framework and its incidence on operative&#13;
procedures.&#13;
72.   Equipment. The PSMTAC will finance a computer network to link the procurement units&#13;
of four Secretariats with SHCP.&#13;
73.   Institutional Arrangements. The PCU will be responsible for coordinating consultants,&#13;
who will work closely with the institutional counterparts in relevant executing agencies. Consult-&#13;
ants will regularly discuss progress with the PCU. The training plan will focus on operative&#13;
aspects but it will be used as a feedback mechanism to test and share the gains from normative&#13;
simplification and procedural streamlining and extend them to each procurement unit.&#13;
Project Coordination (estimated US$1.3 million, 8.2% of project costs)&#13;
74.   This component will support a PCU attached to the Executive Secretariat of the CPME.&#13;
The PCU will be responsible for supporting execution and monitoring progress under the project&#13;
and for supporting the carrying out of the Government activities associated with the incremental&#13;
operating costs of the PSMTAC. The PCU will be headed by a National Director (the Minister of&#13;
the Presidency and Secretary of the CPME), and will be staffed with a Project Coordinator and&#13;
five professionals. The PCU also will have a budget to finance short-term consultants, training and&#13;
office technology equipment. Moreover, the PSMTAC will finance an information and consensus-&#13;
building campaign, which will include consulting services, seminars and workshops, publications,&#13;
and office technology equipment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
PROJECT COST AND FINANCING&#13;
75.    Estimated project costs by component (total costs including IDA/IDB and Government&#13;
financing of $16.7 million) are as follows: Private Sector Participation in Public Services&#13;
Component, $3.8 million; Administrative Reform (Institutional Restructuring Component, $2.1&#13;
million and Social Security Institute and Social Security System  Component, $1.1 million),&#13;
Reform of Public Management (Human Resource Management Component, $2.5 million,&#13;
Integrated Financial Management and Investment Programming Component, $4.9 million, and&#13;
Public Procurement Component, $0.5 million); Project Coordination, $1.3 million; and contin-&#13;
gencies US$0.4 million.&#13;
76.    These cost estimates are based on the experience gained during the PPF implementation&#13;
which funded national and international consultants, equipment and limited training. The&#13;
experience has demonstrated the effectiveness and cost efficiency of using a team of national&#13;
consultants supported by selected international consultants. This arrangement has also led to a&#13;
valuable transfer of knowledge and skills to local professionals.&#13;
77.    In deciding on the financing of the PSMTAC, IDA  and the IDB  will follow  basic&#13;
guidelines based on (a) simplicity, and (b) the experience that either Bank has in the different&#13;
areas. Wherever possible, either Bank will finance the externally-funded portion of a component&#13;
in its entirety. The estimated financing arrangements of the PSMTAC are summarized in the table.&#13;

SECTION B: PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
PROJECT ORGANIZATION&#13;
78.   The Borrower will be the Republic of Honduras. Overall project coordination of the&#13;
PSMTAC will be the responsibility of the Executive Secretariat of the Presidential Commission&#13;
for the Modernization of the State (CPME), in association with the Council of Ministers (headed&#13;
by the President of the Republic) and the Technical Secretariat of the Economic Cabinet. The&#13;
CPME has been building a track record by successfully managing activities under the PPF and no&#13;
other entity in Honduras has this type of experience implementing technical assistance. To&#13;
strengthen its capacity, the Executive Secretariat of the CPME will receive assistance under the&#13;
PSMTAC. The day-to-day management of the project will be the responsibility of a National&#13;
Director who will head the PCU. The PCU will depend directly from the Executive Secretariat of&#13;
the CPME and will be supported by a small staff, including a Project Coordinator, an account-&#13;
ing/financial administrator, a procurement officer, three technical staff, and a network of&#13;
technical/coordination units for each of the project components. These specialized techni-&#13;
cal/coordination units will be headed by a coordinator reporting to the National Director and&#13;
assisted with short-term technical assistance. In the case of privatization, the Executive Secretary&#13;
of the Consultative Commission on Privatization will serve as the head of the Techni-&#13;
cal/Coordination Unit for the Private Sector Participation in Public Services Component; the&#13;
bidding and contracting for this component will be the responsibility of SCHP.&#13;
79.   The Executive Secretariat of the CPME (supported by the PCU) and the Secretariat of&#13;
Finance and Public Credit (SHCP), supported by the CCP, will be responsible for contracting of&#13;
consultants, as well as for the acquisition of equipment. The Executive Secretariat of the CPME&#13;
could, however, delegate these responsibilities to the implementing entities. All actions related to&#13;
the execution of the Private Sector Participation in Public Services Component under the&#13;
responsibility of SHCP will be transmitted to IDA through the CPME.&#13;
80.   Each beneficiary entity will select candidates for consulting services, designate a project&#13;
manager who will serve as the counterpart for the monitoring and coordination of the reform,&#13;
actively participate in the design of the reform, and be ultimately responsible for its implementa-&#13;
tion. This will ensure that the entities develop ownership of the reform and gain sufficient&#13;
autonomy and experience in the process of design and implementation. The project manager will&#13;
be the counterpart for supervision purposes. However, as the number of public entities benefiting&#13;
from the project wili be large, the final responsibility for ensuring that activities are carried out&#13;
properly will lie with the project manager in the head of each sector, who will coordinate the&#13;
activities of the dependent entities. The IDB Field Office in Tegucigalpa will play a substantive&#13;
role in supporting and monitoring the implementation of the PSMTAC. One short-term interna-&#13;
tional consultant to help monitor the program will be hired under the project.&#13;
81.  In those cases where normative entities are charged with the responsibility for implement-&#13;
ing the macro-systems, those entities will be responsible for the implementation of the systems in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
each beneficiary entity. and ensure that activities are executed in accordance with the overall plan.&#13;
This will be the case for the DGSC and SHCP that are charged with the responsibility for&#13;
implementing the human resource management reforms for the civil service regime in all&#13;
Secretariats and JNBS; and for the economics and finance Secretariats that are responsible for&#13;
implementing the integrated financial management and investment programming in all public&#13;
sector entities. These normative entities will receive assistance from short-term international&#13;
consultants.&#13;
82.   To ensure that the activities financed under the project remain consistent with the&#13;
objectives and priorities of the Government's Public Sector Modernization Program, a Project&#13;
Implementation Review would be conducted on a semi-annual basis to update the program of&#13;
assistance. The purpose of these reviews would be to secure adaptability and continued relevance&#13;
of the proposed PSMTAC to the goals of the overall program. During each review, IDA/IDB,&#13;
with the Executive Secretariat of the CPME and the relevant executing agencies, would assess the&#13;
status of project implementation, evaluate workplans, and agree on needed modifications to the&#13;
original program.&#13;
83.   Assistance through the PPF has already been instrumental at establishing a momentum for&#13;
the reform, and initiating implementation in the areas covered by the PSMSAC and PSMTAC.&#13;
The Executive Secretariat of the CPME has been the core of the institutional network and has&#13;
developed effective linkages and workable institutional arrangements with all the counterparts&#13;
involved in the reform. This process has also slowly affected a cultural change among managers of&#13;
public entities, and an increasingly positive attitude toward the reform. The cultural change has&#13;
been stimulated by the prospect of benefits to follow rationalization efforts such as the possibility&#13;
for greater financial independence for the institutions, salary decompression for selected&#13;
professional staff, and training and equipment.&#13;
TRAINIG PLAN&#13;
84.   A Training Unit, in charge of developing and implementing a training program for the&#13;
modernization of the public sector, will be set up in the PCU. The training program will consist of&#13;
(a) different modules in the areas of human resource management, financial management and&#13;
investment programming, public procurement, and internal control, (b) on-the-job training, and&#13;
(c) a specialized curriculum program in a local university for computer staff The outputs of the&#13;
various consultancies will provide the basis for the development of the training modules. For&#13;
example, the output of the consultancy in charge of assisting in the design of modern methods and&#13;
procedures to support fundamental financial management functions will serve as the basis for the&#13;
development of a training module on modern methods and procedures in financial management&#13;
functions. As another example, the output of the consultancy in charge of assisting in the&#13;
development of adequate personnel policies and administration will provide the basis for the&#13;
development of a training module on modern personnel policies and administration. It is envisaged&#13;
that the training modules will be introduced to key staff in all Secretariats (around 50 persons per&#13;
Secretariat) and that these key staff will in turn become trainers within their work units for a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
multiplier effect. The Government will designate an installation to serve as the training center,&#13;
which will be equipped with computers, software, and audiovisual equipment.&#13;
85.   The training plan will include: (a) a summary of the previous year training program, (b)&#13;
proposed changes to training courses, (c) title and budget for each course, (d) name of consult-&#13;
ants or firms responsible for training, (e) location of the course, (f) estimated number of partici-&#13;
pants, and (g) procurement status.&#13;
86.   Each coordinator will be responsible for maintaining the following information: (a) an&#13;
executive summary, (b) title and location of course, (c) name of consultant or firm, (d) budget, (e)&#13;
list of participants and their affiliation, and (f) a copy of the evaluation form completed by the&#13;
executing agency.&#13;
PROCUREMENT&#13;
87.   IDA's Procurement Guidelines (January 1995) will govern the procurement of all IDA-&#13;
financed goods under the project. Contracts for goods (computer equipment and software)&#13;
exceeding US$50,000 and totaling about US$2.0 million will be procured through limited&#13;
international bidding (LIB) among qualified suppliers with established maintenance and services&#13;
facilities in Honduras. For LIB procedures, standard bidding documents acceptable to IDA will be&#13;
used. Contracts for goods equal to or below US$50,000 will be procured through international&#13;
shopping procedures, up to an aggregate of US$900,000. Other equipment will be procured&#13;
through national competitive bidding (NCB) in packages of US$25,000 or more, up to an&#13;
aggregate of US$300,000. When estimated to cost less than US$25,000 per package, and up to&#13;
an aggregate amount equivalent of US$300,000, equipment will be procured under national&#13;
shopping procedures with quotations from at least three eligible suppliers. All LIB procurement of&#13;
goods above US$50,000 equivalent, and the first two contracts under NCB procedures, will be&#13;
subject to prior review by IDA. This review process would result in a prior review of approxi-&#13;
mately 80% of all IDA-financed contracts for goods.&#13;
88.   IDA's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World&#13;
Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981) will govern all IDA-financed consultancies under the&#13;
project. Terms of reference for all studies and contracts for services financed by IDA will be&#13;
subject to IDA approval. Prior review of all consultant contracts with individuals will be required&#13;
for contracts exceeding US$25,000 and for all consultant contracts with firms exceeding&#13;
US$50,000. These thresholds will allow for all prior review of approximately 70% of the total&#13;
value of Bank-financed consultants contracts. Contracts below the respective prior review&#13;
threshold, except for assignments that IDA considers to be of critical nature, will require only&#13;
prior review of terms of reference and post-review. Agreement was reached on the use of IDA's&#13;
standard form of contract for time-based complex consultant assignments. A summary procure-&#13;
ment table is provided in Annex D.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
89.   The proposed credit will be disbursed over a four-year period, with a completion date of&#13;
December 31, 1999. The project closing date will be June 30, 2000. Disbursements would be&#13;
made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) for contracts valued below US$50,000.&#13;
For every contract equal to or above this amount, disbursements would be fully documented. For&#13;
disbursements made through SOEs, detailed documentation providing evidence of expenditures&#13;
would be retained by the PCU in Tegucigalpa, and made available for the required audit and also&#13;
for supervision by IDA. A special account in U.S. Dollars with an authorized allocation of&#13;
$700,000 would be established in the Central Bank of Honduras to facilitate Government's&#13;
execution of the project. The first advance to the special account, however, will be limited to&#13;
$350,000 to avoid overfunding or having an inactive account during the first few months of the&#13;
project. The special account would be replenished on a monthly basis.&#13;
AUDITS&#13;
90.   The PCU will maintain records and accounts of all transactions related to the PSMTAC.&#13;
The Government would hire independent auditing services satisfactory to IDA to prepare annual&#13;
audits at the end of each Honduran fiscal year, starting January 1996. The audit reports would&#13;
include separate opinions on the use of SOEs and the special account. The PCU would submit the&#13;
audit reports to IDA within six months of the close of each fiscal year.&#13;
MONITORING AND SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
91.  IDA will supervise the implementation of the PSMTAC in parallel with the PSMSAC&#13;
supervision missions, and at other times as needed or requested by the Government, with a total&#13;
annual PSMTAC-related supervision input of approximately 12 staff weeks. In addition,&#13;
responsibilities for supervision will be shared with the IDB with special support from the Resident&#13;
Office in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. During negotiations, agreements will be obtained on arrange-&#13;
ments for annual and mid-term reviews. Although the success of the adjustment program will not&#13;
be determined solely on the success of the PSMTAC, adequate technical assistance delivery&#13;
should, to a large extent, contribute to the success of the PSMSAC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX A&#13;
LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY'&#13;
1.    The purpose of this letter is to provide an overview of the efforts that our Government&#13;
is making in developing and implementing a consistent program of macroeconomic stabiliza-&#13;
tion and public sector modernization; and request the assistance of the World Bank Group&#13;
through the Public Sector Modernization Structural Adjustment Credit (PSMSAC) and the&#13;
related Public Sector Modernization Technical Assistance Credit (PSMTAC) which will both&#13;
be cofinanced by the IDB.&#13;
2.    The Public Sector Modernization Program was designed by the Government to rede-&#13;
fine the role of the State as to increase private sector participation in the provision of public&#13;
goods and services, while limiting the public sector to policy-making and regulatory functions,&#13;
reducing its size and improving its efficiency. It focuses on three areas: (a) private sector par-&#13;
ticipation in public services; (b) administrative reform, and (c) reform of public management.&#13;
Many of the activities under this wider program of reform are being complemented by several&#13;
sectoral projects among which IDA/IDB's AGSAC, ESAC, the proposed water and sanitation&#13;
structural and technical assistance projects, IDA's Transport Rehabilitation Project, and IDB's&#13;
project on taxation. Our Government is also making substantive progress in implementing the&#13;
macroeconomic program agreed with the IMF under the Extended Structural Adjustment Fa-&#13;
cility (ESAF), which appropriately complements the efforts on the expenditure side with im-&#13;
portant revenue measures, and with a consistent monetary policy.&#13;
Macroeconomic Program&#13;
3.    The Government intends to achieve export-oriented economic growth of at least 4.5%&#13;
a year during 1995-97. To meet this objective the Government has been increasing national&#13;
savings, largely by reducing its fiscal deficit, and decreased public investment.&#13;
4.    Under the second annual arrangement of the ESAF agreement with the IMF, approved&#13;
on January 30, 1995, and in accordance with the Policy Framework Paper 1994-97, fiscal con-&#13;
solidation is the main element of the Government plan. The fiscal deficit was reduced from&#13;
10.7 percent of GDP in 1993 to 7.5 percent in 1994, and is on target for a further reduction to&#13;
4 percent in 1995 and 1.5 percent by 1997. Beyond 1995, fiscal improvement will rely on ex-&#13;
penditure rationalization, through the modernization of the public sector and privatization of&#13;
public services.&#13;
5.    The objective of monetary policy is to strengthen the net foreign asset position of the&#13;
Central Bank, as a means to control credit, and lower inflation to around 5 percent by 1997. In&#13;
1995, the targets were: a $185 million increase in foreign net reserves, and an inflation rate of&#13;
12 percent down from 30 percent in 1994. The Government has been able, thus far, to funda-&#13;
mentally meet the fiscal and monetary targets agreed with the IMF, and will continue making&#13;
the necessary efforts to keep the plan on its course.&#13;
6.    Nevertheless, as you know, our country is confronting a debt burden which has become&#13;
a critical problem hampering the sustainability of the economic growth and social welfare.&#13;
' This is a translation of the official letter signed by the representatives of GOH on January 4, 1996.&#13;
A_LDP.DOC&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
A-2&#13;
During 1994, the total external debt was US$4.2 billion (or 128% of GDP), and the debt serv-&#13;
ice to goods and services exports ratio was 34 percent. The multilateral institutions such as&#13;
IBRD, IDB and CABEI hold 58 percent of this external debt. The Government will continue&#13;
seeking agreements with the Paris Club and Latin American creditors as well as pursue other&#13;
initiatives conducive to reducing the debt burden.&#13;
Private Sector Participation in Public Services&#13;
7.    Public Services have generated high fiscal expenditure and external debt service. The&#13;
objective of the reform is to promote efficiency in public services by increasing private sector&#13;
participation. Efforts are being made in the sectors of: telecommunications, civil aviation, and&#13;
electric power. Privatization will increase fiscal revenues, reduce public investment require-&#13;
ments, decrease the public debt and debt servicing requirements, and induce private invest-&#13;
ment.&#13;
Telecommunications&#13;
8.    The Government has developed a strategy for increasing private sector participation,&#13;
competition and efficiency in telecommunications. Key to the strategy is the development of an&#13;
appropriate institutional framework that separates the functions of policy, regulation, and op-&#13;
eration -- now concentrated in the state telecommunication company (Hondutel). The Secretar-&#13;
iat of Communications, Public Works and Transport will be responsible for the policy-making&#13;
in the sector.&#13;
9.    A regulatory entity will be established as an autonomous public institution with the&#13;
power to extend licenses and concessions. This entity would issue and enforce regulations&#13;
pertaining to the regulatory framework; design and enforce an appropriate competition and&#13;
tariff regime, and promote private investment and market competition.&#13;
10.   The new Telecommunications Framework Law approved by Congress on October 30,&#13;
1995, allows Hondutel to engage in joint ventures with private or foreign investors and to open&#13;
competition within the sector while retaining its exclusivity to operate basic telephonic voice&#13;
services for a limited time period. A transparent bidding procedure would confer to a pre-&#13;
qualified strategic investor(s) the control of management and operation of the newly estab-&#13;
lished enterprise(s). The enterprise(s) would gain from increased capitalization and qualified&#13;
management. The private operator will have to invest in the modernization and expansion of&#13;
the services, resulting in a substantial participation in the company. On the other hand, the&#13;
Government will benefit by rationalizing public investment and reducing its future debt service.&#13;
At the end of the exclusivity period, a competition regime will ensure entry in the sector. Ac-&#13;
cording to the Law, all other telecommunication services will be open to competition.&#13;
11.   During the next year, the regulatory entity will be fully operational, regulations issued,&#13;
a tariff regime approved, and the final bidding documents for basic phone services issued. In&#13;
the following year, management and control of the enterprises in charge of basic phone serv-&#13;
ices will be operated by private investors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
A-3&#13;
Civil Aviation&#13;
12.   The Govermnent has presented to Congress the Civil Aviation Law and the Law for the&#13;
Honduran Enterprise of Airports and Air Navigation Services, which incorporate its strategy&#13;
for restructuring the civil aviation sector. The strategy entails eliminating the General Direc-&#13;
torate of Civil Aviation (DGAC) from the Secretariat of Communications, Public Works and&#13;
Transport, creating a regulatory entity, establishing a public enterprise to operate the airports&#13;
and air navigation services, and substantially increasing private sector participation in airport&#13;
operations. The enterprise will have the option of extending concessions for the operation of a&#13;
whole airport, or manage directly the services of air navigation, transit, weather and informna-&#13;
tion, communications, and airport administration, and extend concessions to the private sector&#13;
for commercial activities such as administration of terminals, commercial space, and land.&#13;
13.   During the next year, the normative entity and the enterprise will be in operation, and some&#13;
concessions will be extended to the private sector which could include at least one major airport or&#13;
several commercial operations across important airports. In the following year, further progress&#13;
would be made in the process of extending concessions which again could include management&#13;
of a whole airport or other commercial operations.&#13;
Electric Power&#13;
14.   The energy sector reform started in 1991 with the support of IDA's ESAC and IDB's&#13;
energy project. The Government has concluded that a significant improvement in sector effi-&#13;
ciency can only come through private sector participation. In November 1994, the Congress&#13;
approved the Framework Law of the Electricity Subsector. The Law separates the functions of&#13;
policy, regulation, and operation, and authorizes private sector participation in generation and&#13;
distribution of electric power. Progress has been made in opening electric power generation to&#13;
the private sector.&#13;
15.   The Law also requires that distribution be separated and transferred to the private sec-&#13;
tor. To this end, the IDB has financed consultants to assist the state-owned utility, ENEE, in&#13;
preparing tender documents to implement the requirements of the Law. This will entail a&#13;
definition of the number of distribution companies and their corresponding geographic areas of&#13;
operation, which will be, subsequently, tendered and transferred to the private sector.&#13;
Administrative Reform&#13;
16.   The Administrative Reform concentrates on essential functions of the public sector,&#13;
rationalizing its organization and some activities, and strengthening the capacity for delivery of&#13;
core services. The public labor force is being reduced to improve its composition, pay structure&#13;
and motivation. The reform takes two lines of action: institutional restructuring, and rationali-&#13;
zation of employment and salary regimes in the civil service and decentralized institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
A-4&#13;
Institutional Restructuring&#13;
17.   Institutional restructuring will redefine the role of Government and improve its effec-&#13;
tiveness and efficiency by: rationalizing its size, restructuring its organization, and establishing&#13;
an adequate legal framework with the new General Law of Public Administration which was&#13;
recently submitted to the National Congress. Rationalization and restructuring will be achieved&#13;
by: (a) eliminating obsolete activities and entities; (b) merging or recentralizing those that are&#13;
duplicated; (c) transferring to the private sector those that can be better performed by it; (d)&#13;
contracting out those th?t can be more cost effectively carried out by other agents; and (e) de-&#13;
centralizing some to the regional offices or local authorities.&#13;
18.   The Government is in the process of implementing its reform in the sectoral Secretari-&#13;
ats--education, health and social services, infrastructure and communications, and natural re-&#13;
sources--and in the core Secretariats responsible for economic management and finance, as&#13;
well as in some decentralized institutes. All of these sectors have high potential for fiscal sav-&#13;
ings and elimination of serious structural problems.&#13;
19.   This component will be implemented in accordance to the Action Plans for Institutional&#13;
Restructuring of the: (a) Secretariat of Public Education, (b) Secretariat of Public Health, (c)&#13;
Social Services Sector, (d) Secretariat of Communications, Public Works and Transport, (e)&#13;
Secretariat of Natural Resources, and (f) Economics and Finance Sector, being attached.&#13;
R3form of Employment &amp; Salaries in the Civil Service and Decentralized Institutions&#13;
20.   Employment and salary regimes rationalization. The objectives of the reform in this&#13;
area are: (a) downsizing to eliminate redundant staff and increase the ratio of professional!&#13;
technical to support staff, (b) improving pay and grading structures of the Civil Service, par-&#13;
ticularly of senior level management and key positions, and developing a transparent pay&#13;
structure for all civil servants; (c) establishing effective mechanisms for enforcing and monitor-&#13;
ing controls of pay, employment levels and structures of the whole public sector; and (d) de-&#13;
veloping a strategy to integrate the different employment regimes of the public sector with an&#13;
aim to develop a comprehensive personnel policy. Staff performance will also be improved by&#13;
creating long-term incentives through the introduction of career development streams and a&#13;
new performance evaluation process.&#13;
21.   Progress has been made in implementing the reform. As a result of implementing insti-&#13;
tutional restructuring plans and the Law of Restructuring (October 1994) in both the central&#13;
and decentralized administration, approximately 3,000 positions have been eliminated since&#13;
January 1994. The Law of Restructuring developed important measures for rationalizing per-&#13;
sonnel expenditures, freezing vacant posts, reducing 10 percent of public employment&#13;
(excluding teachers and medical staff); eliminating expenditures for substitute and emergency&#13;
staff, and freezing contracts paid with internal financing. In addition, posts audits and censuses&#13;
are being carried out in selective areas.&#13;

Salary Reform in the Civil Service, Neighboring Regimes and Decentralized Institutions, at-&#13;

Reform of Public Management&#13;
23.   Reform of public management focuses on: (a) public sector human resource manage-&#13;
ment and effective control mechanisms; and (b) financial management and investment pro-&#13;
gramming. In addition, reforms are being undertaken in the area of public procurement.&#13;
24.   Development of a Comprehensive Public Sector Human Resource Management and&#13;
Effective Control Mechanisms. The objective of the reform is to improve integrally the infor-&#13;
mation systems that support public sector human resource management and control in a com-&#13;
prehensive fashion. The Government has been developing and implementing a human resource&#13;
and payroll database for the Civil Service and other Central Government regimes, which will be&#13;
extended to the rest of the public sector; and carrying out a census and audit of posts in health,&#13;
activity which will be continued in other sectors, particularly in education. The Government&#13;
has also conformed, within the Presidential Commission for the Modernization of the State, a&#13;
Interministerial Commission for Employment and Salary Policy which will monitor and control&#13;
employment indicators. This component will be implemented according to the Action Plan for&#13;
Control and Integration of Human Resource Management in the Public Sector. (attached)&#13;
25.   Integrated Financial Management and Investment Programming. The main objective in&#13;
this area is improve the allocation and use of Central Government financial resources by mod-&#13;
ernizing the systems for planning, execution, control and evaluation of expenditures. The em-&#13;
phasis of the approach is the development of modern integrated systems of financial manage-&#13;
ment and investment programming, within a new institutional and normative framework that&#13;
will afford a greater degree of autonomy and accountability to public entities in budget plan-&#13;
ning and execution, and establish performance evaluation mechanisms.&#13;
26.   This component will be implemented according to the Action Plan for the Moderniza-&#13;
tion of Financial Management and Investment Programming. (attached)&#13;
27.   Modernizing Public Procurement. The principal objectives are creating a decentralized&#13;
system of procurement, enhancing competition, strengthening procurement units in each public&#13;
entity, and simplifying and making transparent the procurement procedures and administrative&#13;
norms. To this end, the Government has eliminated the Central Procurement Office as an op-&#13;
erative unit, and procurement and contracting are being made the responsibility of operational&#13;
units of each agency.&#13;
28.   The Government wishes to acknowledge the World Bank efforts in the development of&#13;
the reform program, and request its continued financial and technical support to ensure the&#13;
successful implementation of this program.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Public Sector
            Modernization Technical Assistance Credit Project are to
            provide: 1) policy formulation support that the government
            needs to design reforms under its public sector
            modernization program (PSMP); 2) implementation support to
            develop the means and information necessary for the reform
            process and to comply with the conditions and action plans
            under the public sector modernization structural adjustment
            credit (PSMSAC), and to modernize human resource management,
            financial management and public procurement systems; and 3)
            institutional strengthening support to the entities that
            will be beneficiaries of these management systems. The
            components of the project are the following: 1) private
            sector participation in public services; 2) administrative
            reform which encompasses institutional restructuring and the
            Honduran Social Security Institute and the Social Security
            System; 3) human resource management; 4) integrated
            financial management and investment programming; and 5)
            public procurement.
