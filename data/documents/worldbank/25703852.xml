                                                        During the last decade, the microfinance sector in the Middle East and North Africa has caromed from crisis to crisis. Some&#13;

     CGAP    Consultative Group to Assist the Poor      Despite those challenges, the microfinance sector has continued to grow. But it has done so at a much slower rate than in&#13;

     While the microfinance sector in the Arab region has grown substantially since the early 2000s, since 2008,&#13;
     the sector has been largely stagnating. In 2008, the sectorâ&#128;&#153;s outreach (measured in terms of credit) was 2.74 million                                                                                                                                                                               6%&#13;

This risk is rated among the moderate risks facing the region, with slightly less than half of the respondents assigning it a rating of&#13;
â&#128;&#152;highâ&#128;&#153; or â&#128;&#152;very highâ&#128;&#153;. Furthermore, this risk is perceived to be steady, particularly from the point of view of financial service providers   Only 49 percent of respondents ranked strategy risk as â&#128;&#152;highâ&#128;&#153; or â&#128;&#152;very highâ&#128;&#153;, suggesting that stakeholders perceive it as a moderate risk to&#13;
and donors. It appears that awareness of risk management and its importance to the health of the sector has improved over the past few        the sector. In addition, an even larger number of respondents do not see strategy as a rising risk. When we come to assess the breakdown&#13;
years given that the ranking of this risk has fallen to 11th place today from 8 place in 2012. â&#128;&#156;This can be attributed to the fact that in&#13;

the wake of the Arab Spring and the Moroccan crisis, many MFIs realized that they did not have sound risk management practices and            they believe that this risk is quite high (ranked as the fifth most severe risk facing the sector). This is understandable as regulators are&#13;
have taken measures to establish risk management units or departments within their institutions,â&#128;&#157; says Mohamed Khaled, Microfinance           likely to be the most concerned about the ability of microfinance institutions to devise strategies to survive and grow in the challenging&#13;

The political situation aside, according to Hassan Faried, the Executive Director of DBACD, the establishment of an independent risk          Some respondents suggested that MFIs in the region currently lack the capacity to develop their own strategies. However, Wakkas Noori,&#13;
management department also becomes a necessity when there is growth in outreach. For smaller institutions, risk management practices          the Executive Director at Al Mosanid Center for Growth and Development, believes that this risk can be overcome â&#128;&#156;through the help of&#13;
can be embedded within procedures and operations. â&#128;&#156;We are yet to see, however, how successful implementation will be in this area,â&#128;&#157;           external expertise that can evaluate strategies and business plansâ&#128;&#157; at a price affordable to many MFIs. Respondents that have ranked this&#13;
says Niveen Abboushi, a consultant. Interestingly, none of the respondents from Morocco, Syria, Lebanon, or Iraq have assigned this           risk highly were in general of the view that it is important for MFIs to have clear strategies otherwise there would be no sustainability&#13;
risk a rating of â&#128;&#152;highâ&#128;&#153; or â&#128;&#152;very highâ&#128;&#153; in terms of severity. National and regional networks have also played a role in increasing awareness   and market loss. Indeed, â&#128;&#156;the ability of MFIs to develop strategies that adequately respond to the changing realities in their markets is a&#13;
of the subject by offering a series of workshops (funded by different donors) on risk management and appear to be the most concerned          prerequisite for the viability of MFIs.â&#128;&#157; Not only that, but a clear strategy, summarized through a business plan, is closely linked to an&#13;

It is important to note that the comments received by respondents on this risk suggest that many think of credit and financial risk when&#13;
they think about risk management. Effective risk management, though, should look at the risks facing an institution in general and&#13;
include other challenges such as achieving an institutional vision, reputational risk, contingency planning, and succession planning, to&#13;
name a few.&#13;

it take off in the Arab World. MFIs need to pay close attention to the importance of digital finance and develop more demand-driven&#13;
                                                                                                                                             many clients. As Hamza Ghannam, Head of the Operations department at FATEN, explains, over-indebtedness can be avoided through&#13;
products as client behaviors change.&#13;
                                                                                                                                             effective client management, which allows MFIs to â&#128;&#156;provide for all the needs of the clientâ&#128;&#157; without providing them with too many loans.&#13;
The perceptions of technology management have remained steady but it is important to be aware of such a risk. As discussed, digital          Inadequate client management can also trigger other challenges such as credit risk and reputational risk. As such, on one hand, MFIs&#13;
finance can dramatically change the way MFIs conduct business and as such, stakeholders in the sector need to be aware of the potential      need to ensure that they are transparent in their engagements with clients and may also wish to offer financial education. On the other&#13;
risk technology management may pose in the future. Furthermore, by harnessing data about clients and their portfolio in general,             hand, clients need to be able to make informed decisions and accept responsibility.&#13;
MFIs can adapt their credit risk systems and even begin to develop more advanced portfolio analytics and credit scoring. As Andrew&#13;
Pospielovsky, a Senior Microfinance Consultant at IFC, points out, technology will â&#128;&#156;revolutionize the provision of financial services over&#13;

The risk of insufficient product diversification is currently not considered to be a major problem facing the Arab region; it was ranked       With the Moroccan microfinance crisis a few years behind us, it appears that stakeholders in the sector are less concerned about credit&#13;
as a low and steady risk by the majority of respondents. This may be because the current legislation in most countries limits NGO-             risk than before, as it ranked 16th on the list of most severe challenges facing the sector. In 2009, credit was ranked as both the biggest&#13;
MFIs (the large majority in the region) from diversifying products beyond simple credit offerings. Laws also impose limitations on             risk and the fastest riser globally and by MENA stakeholders . This result is slightly surprising, however, given the fact that credit risk&#13;

example is Microfund for Women in Jordan, which has partnered with Al Manara Insurance Company to develop a micro-insurance                    region, supporting the perception that credit risk does not pose a major threat to the sector, one has to question whether PAR&gt;30 is&#13;

and transportation for medical services. Al Barid Bank in Morocco has partnered with Al Wafa Insurance Company and Al Amana with               that are quite prominent in the sector. Among those that have rated this risk quite highly, different views were given as to why this is a&#13;

These efforts to diversify products remain somewhat limited, though. As a result, some stakeholders, such as donors and investors,&#13;
                                                                                                                                               that the consequences of credit risk are quite high. â&#128;&#156;Late repayments cost MFIs a lot of money which could be used in granting more&#13;

networks, part of their role is to encourage fuller, more accurate reporting across the sector. It is important to note here that there are&#13;
fewer MFIs reporting to the MIX from the region than there used to be. Networks have typically been the ones coordinating such efforts&#13;
and, as such, national networks are the most aware of this increasing risk.&#13;

Foreign exchange risk ranks quite low in terms of severity, as it also did in the 2012 Banana Skins report, only being recognized as a&#13;
severe risk by researchers, consultants, and trainers. This risk is also perceived to be steady by over 65 percent of respondents. This is       It appears that few respondents are concerned about the risk of mission drift, given that only 24 percent have rated it as â&#128;&#152;highâ&#128;&#153; or â&#128;&#152;very&#13;
likely to be the case given that a large number of MFIs in the region borrow in local currency and are therefore not subject to the volatility   highâ&#128;&#153;. This is unlike the results of 2009, where mission drift was ranked as the sixth most severe facing the microfinance sector in the&#13;
of currency relationships. In the cases where MFIs do borrow in hard currency, volatility in currency markets can have severe negative           Middle East. This is perhaps because respondents share a common view that this risk is entirely within the control of MFIs and that it        27&#13;

She says recent regional events have â&#128;&#156;demonstrated a commitment from both clients and partners during&#13;

To minimize the risk arising from that, FATEN sets the foreign currency             difficult times.â&#128;&#157; Perhaps this perception of mission drift will change in the future as the discussion on regulation advances in the region&#13;
prices against US dollars daily at the market price with a margin. FATEN maintains two main bank accounts in foreign currency to                 and MFIs become allowed to transform into for-profit entities. It is also likely to change if leadership changes, given that the region has&#13;
pool repayments in this currency. There is currently a procedure in place that limits the amount of foreign currency available in FATEN          many of the CEOs/founders in place. Fifteen years ago, the sectorâ&#128;&#153;s mission was achieved through its vision to provide microcredit to&#13;

Today, the sectorâ&#128;&#153;s vision is more focused on financial inclusion - a different agenda. Perhaps the entry of&#13;

     The final question in the survey asked respondents to what extent they believe that the microfinance sector in the Arab&#13;
     region is prepared to handle the identified risks on a scale of one (not prepared at all) to five (very well-prepared). The results&#13;

     appear to be less equipped to handle the identified risks. At the market level, there is a clear message that risks need to be&#13;
     identified and handled accordingly in each market in order to reach the financially excluded with products and services that&#13;
     are adapted to their needs and that are delivered in a responsible manner .                      30&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
     Among those that do not see the sector to be well-prepared to address the identified risks, there is the view that MFIs&#13;
     operating in the region fail to see the changes taking place around them and as such they fail to develop adequate strategies&#13;
     to address such changes . These changes include developments in the economy, in technology, and in the financial services&#13;
                                      31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     business. Perhaps this study will play a role in helping MFIs better understand the myriad risks that surround them and in&#13;
     encouraging them to invest in building their risk management capacities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     3.3 KEY TAKEAWAYS&#13;
&#13;
     Based on the perceptions of the survey respondents, the key takeaway from VOICES is that external risks such as security&#13;
     and macroeconomic risks are perceived to be more imminent to the sector than internal ones. Indeed, the top four risks are&#13;
     exogenous. When we come to assess the top ten risks facing the sector, we find that HR issues both in terms of staffing and&#13;
     management quality have surfaced as prominent risks. This is an important finding for several reasons. With the changing&#13;
     regulations in the region that will allow the entry of new players into the market, the demand for qualified management and&#13;
     loan officers is likely to increase. MFIs therefore need to ensure that they have effective HR policies that will help them retain&#13;
     their staff as opposed to lose them to new competition. In addition, the executives in many MFIs across the region have held&#13;
     their positions for substantial periods of time with limited succession planning. This could have negative repercussions on&#13;
     the continuity of the sector in the near future. Finally, corporate governance was highlighted as one of the top ten risks facing&#13;
     the sector. Again, in light of the changing regulations, MFIs may be allowed to register as non-bank financial institutions,&#13;
     which would create a need for investors and as such a need for sound corporate governance.&#13;
     While the findings of VOICES suggest that the majority of the risks facing the sector are beyond the sectorâ&#128;&#153;s control, one&#13;
     must take this opportunity to assess whether external risks are the sole force behind the sectorâ&#128;&#153;s stagnation over the last&#13;
     decade. After all, instability, lack of security and macroeconomic volatility have been characteristics of our region for quite&#13;
     some time now and in a sense have become the â&#128;&#152;new normalâ&#128;&#153;. Perhaps, VOICES can act as a first step in our effort to think&#13;
     more critically about the risks facing the sector.&#13;

            Voices assessment of perceived risks facing

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            During the last decade, the microfinance
            sector in MENA has caromed from crisis to crisis. Some were
            caused by problems within the sector itself (Morocco
            crisis), while others were a product of the political
            instability that has gripped the region since the beginning
            of what was known then as the Arab Spring (early 2011).
            Within this context, this publication was developed as a
            joint collaboration between IFC’s MENA Microfinance Advisory
            Team and Sanabel, the Microfinance Network of Arab
            countries. It adopts the same methodology as the Global
            Microfinance Banana Skin and focuses on the main risks
            facing the industry in the Arab World today as seen by a
            broad range of stakeholders, from donors to microfinance
            institutions to regulators.
