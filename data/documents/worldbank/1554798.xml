ABSTRACT&#13;
This paper reports the results of an evaluation of Bank-assisted&#13;
diversified secondary schools (INEM) in Colombia offering prevocational&#13;
subjects alongside the traditional academic curriculum. The evaluation is&#13;
based on a retrospective follow-up of nearly 1,800 graduates of" target" and&#13;
"control" schools three years after leaving school.   The central finding is&#13;
that the new schools have not generated further training or employment&#13;
patterns that are different from the control schools. In particular, INEM&#13;
graduates are not more likely to enter employment immediately upon graduation&#13;
and do not obtain higher earnings in the labor market than traditional&#13;
graduates. According to this initial evaluation, there is virtually no&#13;
difference in the social rate of return on the resources invested in the two&#13;
types of schools.&#13;

EXTRACTO&#13;
En este estudio se dan a conocer los resultados de una evaluaci6n de&#13;
los "institutos nacionales de educaci6n media diversificada" (INEM) de&#13;
Colombia --los cuales reciben asistencia del Banco Mundial-- que imparten&#13;
enseiianza en materias de formaci6n preprofesional paralelamente con los&#13;
planes de estudios academicos tradicionales. La evaluaci6n se basa en un&#13;
seguimiento retrospectivo de cerca de 1.800 graduados de los institutos&#13;
fijados como "meta" y de un grupo de escuelas "testigo" tres aiios despues&#13;
de egresados. La conclusi6n principal consiste en que las nuevas escuelas&#13;
no han generado pautas de capacitaci6n o empleo que sean diferentes de las&#13;
observadas en las escuelas testigo. De modo especial, comparados con los&#13;
graduados de escuelas tradicionales, no es mas probable que los de los&#13;
INEM obtengan empleo inmediatamente despues de graduados, ni que en el&#13;
mercado laboral los ingresos que obtienen sean mas altos. De acuerdo con&#13;
esta evaluaci6n inicial, practicamente no hay diferencia en lo que&#13;
concierne a la tasa de rendimiento social sobre los recursos invertidos en&#13;
los dos tipos de escuelas.&#13;

Ce document pr6sente les r6sultats d'une 6valuation des 6coles&#13;
secondaires polyvalentes (INEM) en Colombie. Ces ecoles, dont la creation&#13;
a ete appuyee par la Banque mondiale, dispensent un enseignement&#13;
preprofessionnel, parallelement au programme scolaire classique.&#13;
L'evaluation s'appuie sur le suivi trois ans apres la fin de leurs 6tudes,&#13;
de quelque 1.800 anciens e1lves d'6coles "polyvalentes" et d'ecoles&#13;
"t6moins". La principale conclusion en est qu'on ne constate pas de&#13;
difference, pour ce qui est de l'emploi comme de la poursuite des etudes,&#13;
entre les diplomes des deux types d'ecoles. En particulier, les e1lves&#13;
des ecoles polyvalentes n'ont pas davantage de chances de trouver un&#13;
emploi des la fin de leurs etudes et ils ne sont pas mieux remuner6s sur&#13;
le marche de l'emploi que les diplomes des 6coles classiques. D'apres&#13;
cette premiere 6valuation, le taux de rentabilite sociale de&#13;
l'investissement est pratiquement le meme pour les deux types d'6cole.&#13;

I.   Introduction&#13;
Colombia is one of the many countries that enacted a series of&#13;
educational reforms in the last two decades to make the school system more&#13;
relevant to the world of work. One particular reform refers to the&#13;
diversification of the secondary school curriculum.&#13;
The origins of this reform date back to 1963 when the Government -&#13;
in collaboration with the World Bank and Unesco - made a diagnostic study of&#13;
Colombian education. The conclusion of the resulting "Varner Report" (1965)&#13;
was that priority should be given to the introduction of specialized&#13;
education at the secondary level. In 1969, Decree No. 1962 introduced a&#13;
separate type of school for this purpose, the INEM (Instituto Nacional de&#13;
Educacion Media Diversificada).&#13;
The World Bank financed the creation of 19 INEM's in Colombia. 1,&#13;
The first such school became operational in 1970 and the last in 1975.&#13;

Because the example of Colombia is not unique, the Bank embarked in&#13;
1981 on an evaluation of secondary school curricula (known as the DiSCuS&#13;
study). Two countries have been chosen as research sites (Colombia and&#13;
Tanzania) on grounds of previous Bank involvement and time lapse since&#13;
implementation for project maturity. The study design is of the longitudinal&#13;
type (tracer study) in order to allow for proper control of individual and&#13;
background characteristcs (for a description of the study and the&#13;
questionnaires used see Psacharopoulos and Loxley, 1984a and 1984b). The&#13;
first instrument to collect baseline information was administered to a sample&#13;
of the 1981 graduating cohort while still in school. A follow-up of the same&#13;
persons took place in 1982.&#13;
Given the long inherent delays associated with longitudinal&#13;
studies, it was felt that the project could yield some early indications on&#13;
the labor market destination and performance of secondary school graduates by&#13;
introducing a pseudo-panel component to it. This was achieved as follows.&#13;
After the selection of the sample of schools and students for the 1981&#13;
cohort, addresses were obtained from the same school of the graduates of the&#13;
1978 class. A target sample of 2,000 such graduates from both INEM and&#13;
traditional schools was randomly selected from the school records and&#13;
attempts were made to locate the graduates for the administration of a&#13;
special questionnaire (see Annex 5). This questionnaire raised retrospective&#13;
information on the student's further education and occupational record&#13;
between 1978 and the Fall of 1981 when the interviews took place. The&#13;
questionnaire also raised information on the graduate's opinion regarding the&#13;
usefulness of the courses he has taken and included a battery of questions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
pertaining to measure individual modernity. In fact, this questionnaire is a&#13;
hybrid of the student base questionnaire of the 1981 cohort and the graduate&#13;
follow-up questionnaire of the same cohort administered one year later. The&#13;
main block of information which is pragmatically missing regarding the 1978&#13;
cohort is the testing of students in particular subjects while they were in&#13;
the last class of secondary school.&#13;
The questionnaires were completed by personal interview at the&#13;
house of each selected graduate. In about 10 percent of the selected cases&#13;
the graduate was no longer living at the same home address reported in the&#13;
1978 school records. In such cases the interviewer moved to the next person&#13;
down the list who lived in the same locality until the target sample size was&#13;
reached. On this ground, the 1978 sample contains a potential unknown bias,&#13;
if those who emigrated between 1978 and the time of the interview in 1981&#13;
differed systematically in some characteristic relative to those who remained&#13;
behind.  Speculating on the direction of the bias, it must have introduced&#13;
"flatter effects", on the assumption that those who emigrated have done so in&#13;
order to improve their position over the locally available alternatives.&#13;
Hypotheses To Be Tested&#13;
The main rationale for the diversification of the secondary&#13;
education in Colombia, and elsewhere, has been to provide a closer link&#13;
between the school system and the economy (Lillis and Hogan 1983). This&#13;
general proposition can be split into a number hypotheses that could be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
tested with the available data. With reference to a control group of&#13;
non-diversified schools, we hypothesize that:&#13;
(a) Diversification leads to less private demand for post-secondary&#13;
education.&#13;
(b) Diversification leads to a higher rate of labor force participation&#13;
at the end of secondary education.&#13;
(c) Diversification leads to a better match between the field of&#13;
vocational specialization and actual employment.&#13;
(d) Diversification leads to lower unemployment (shorter job search).&#13;
(e) Diversification leads to higher earnings of graduates.&#13;
(f) Diversification is cost-effective in achieving any of the above&#13;
aims.&#13;
The Sample&#13;
Figure 1 shows a simplified structure of the Colombian educational&#13;
system. Primary school graduates who continue their education typically&#13;
split into three parallel schools at the secondary level: traditional&#13;
academic schools, vocational schools and INEMs. Vocational schools are&#13;
devoted to one area of specialization, e.g. agriculture or commerce during&#13;
the full six-year cycle. INEMs, however, offer a diversified curriculum, in&#13;

the sense of splitting the six year cycle into three distinct phases:&#13;
vocational exploration, vocational orientation and occupational&#13;
specialization. The latter can take place in five main areas: academic,&#13;
commercial, industrial, agricultural and social services. The target group&#13;
of the investigation was the population of the last year INEM students&#13;
(shaded area in Figure 1). Thus, the control for the academic track of INEM&#13;
was the mainstream academic secondary school (bachillerato clasico). The&#13;
controls for the industrial, commercial, agricultural and social services&#13;
INEM tracks were vocational schools specializing in the respective areas&#13;
(colegios univocacionales).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
II. An Overview of the Data&#13;
The sample yielded a total of nearly 1,800 observations. The&#13;
distribution of the respondents across school types and subjects is shown in&#13;

The Destination of Graduates&#13;
Table 2 compares the first destination of graduates to their status&#13;
three years later (1981) in terms of four categories: study only, study and&#13;
work, work only and other. The "other" category includes those who are not&#13;
participating in the labor force or are looking for work.&#13;
1/ The effective sample of INEM students corresponds to 14 percent of the&#13;
total enrollment in such schools.&#13;

This table reveals a stability in the major activity distribution&#13;
of the cohort over a three year period and a surprising increase of those who&#13;
classify themselves as students. A cross-tabulation of first status against&#13;
current status (Table 3) shows that the stability of the marginal distri-&#13;
butions hides considerable mobility between activities during the three year&#13;
span. This variety of destinations is illustrated graphically in Figure 2.&#13;

There are two points worth noting regarding the overall destination&#13;
of the cohort. First, those who are in a given state upon graduation (e.g.&#13;
work) would normally continue to be in the same state three years later.&#13;
Hence, by studying the initial destination of graduates one can predict a&#13;
great deal of their ultimate destination. Second, for those who continue to&#13;
study, a three years tracer is not enough to fully evaluate their performance&#13;
in the labor market.&#13;

Figure 3 (where the interperiod flows have been deleted) shows the&#13;
status of INEM and control graduates separately. It is difficult, on the&#13;
basis of these data, to reject the hypothesis that the INEMs have contributed&#13;
fewer high school graduates to the labor market than conventional schools.&#13;
More than 38 percent of the control students as compared to only 35 percent&#13;
of the INEM students were working in 1981. The difference is not dramatic&#13;
but, if at all, one would have expected it to go the other way around. The&#13;
result is maintained after including among the workers category those&#13;
individuals who combine work and study. Then conventional schools contribute&#13;
61.5 percent of their graduates to the labor market while INEMs only&#13;
contribute 55.8 percent of theirs.&#13;

Figures 4 and 5 show that the differences that exist between INEMs&#13;
and traditional schools are also present when the sample is divided by sex,&#13;
but clearly the most marked divergencies in the employment patterns occur in&#13;
the case of men, and in particular in the categories of graduates studying&#13;
only or working only. In 1981, 34.5 percent of male INEM graduates were&#13;
studying only, as compared to 25.6 percent of male graduates from traditional&#13;
schools - a difference of almost 9 percent between the two school types.&#13;
Concerning the "work only" category, the percentages are 36.4 for INEMs and&#13;
44.0 for control schools - a difference of almost 8 percent. For female&#13;
graduates, although the differences in these two categories go in the same&#13;
direction as for males, their magnitude is much smaller.&#13;

Having shown the basic structure of the data under analysis, we now&#13;
proceed to investigate to what extent these data can help to reject or&#13;
otherwise the hypotheses detailed above. However, before entering into the&#13;
hypotheses themselves, we want to look more closely at the type of students&#13;
who have been attracted by INEM.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

III. Who attends the INEMs?&#13;
The simple inspection of the data suggests that it is not clear&#13;
that INEMs have resulted in employment patterns widely different from those&#13;
generated by traditional schools. Nevertheless, it may be the case that&#13;
INEMs have managed to provide secondary education to students who typically&#13;
would not have had access to this educational level. If this is the case,&#13;
INEMs may have had desirable distributional effects. Here we cannot evaluate&#13;
these distributional effects because even if real, they will not manifest&#13;
themselves until later in the graduates' working life. But we can at least&#13;
look at the characteristics of INEM students and see to what extent they&#13;
differ from those of traditional schools.&#13;
The first two rows of Table 4 show indeed that INEM students come&#13;
from families which are poorer than those of control students. Both family&#13;
and father's income are more than 13% higher for control than for INEM&#13;
students. There must be important reporting errors in these two variables,&#13;
but there is no a priori reason that these should operate differently in the&#13;
two groups. Thus the comparison in Table 4 could be a reliable indicator of&#13;
the relative disadvantage of the two types of families. This is confirmed&#13;
by rows 3 and 4, which show that both parents of control students are better&#13;
educated than those of INEM students. The difference is not very large but&#13;
the ordering is consistent with that of family and father's income. The last&#13;
two rows show indicators of the students' academic background and perhaps&#13;
ability. The percentage of INEM students who repeated at least one year in&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
primary education is substantially larger than that of control students, but&#13;
when we consider repeaters in secondary education then INEM students do&#13;
better than control students. These two facts may suggest that INEM&#13;
students, although with a much worse primary education, are not worse than&#13;
control students in terms of ability and motivation. However, they could&#13;
also suggest that the INEMs are educationally much better than traditional&#13;
schools; according to these data the new schools have managed to lower&#13;
substantially the rate of repeaters relative to control schools, despite&#13;
having started with a student population which was apparently worse.&#13;

Table 5 shows the distribution of students in INEM and control&#13;
schools by father's occupation. The first conclusion from these figures is&#13;
that there are certain differences in the two distributions. As compared&#13;
with control schools, INEMs seem to have a more homogeneous student&#13;
population in terms of its socio-economic background. More than 71% of INEM&#13;
student have fathers with occupation in the middle range of the status scale&#13;
(employees and professionals), while in control schools their percentage is&#13;
only 62%. At the two extremes of the scale, on the other hand, control&#13;
schools have relatively more students. 27.6% of control students have&#13;
fathers who are farmers or manual workers, while only 21.5% of INEM students&#13;
have fathers with these professions. Also, 10.3 of control students have&#13;
fathers who are business owners as compared to only 7.1% for INEM students.&#13;

The figures in Table 4 suggest that the possible equity effects&#13;
that INEMs may have had are weaker than those that would be inferred by the&#13;
mean comparison of Table 4.   The distribution in terms of socio-economic&#13;
background is different, but this difference only affects the center of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
distribution. INEMs do not seem to have had much impact in attracting&#13;
farmer's or business owner's sons. It may be presumed that the farmers are&#13;
still largely located at the lower end of the quality scale of traditional&#13;
schools, and the later at the upper end.&#13;
Another significant difference concern the proportion of males that&#13;
attend INEMs.    Overall, 61.8% of INEM students are males as compared to only&#13;
45.1% in control schools. This might be attributed to the fact that Pedagogy&#13;
(a largely female-attended specialty) is not taught in INEMs. But as&#13;
Table 6 shows, with the exception of Industrial students, all other subjects&#13;
have a higher proportion of males in INEMs than in conventional schools. The&#13;
difference is particularly large (more than double) in Academic and&#13;
Commercial studies, and less important in Agricultural and Social Services.&#13;
We thus conclude that relative to control schools, INEMS are largely attended&#13;
by males. 2/&#13;
2/ These results are largely maintained when the influence of all these&#13;
factors is jointly taken into account. A logit analysis of the&#13;
probability of attending INEMs confirmed that INEMs are significantly&#13;
more attended by males and urban residents in cities of relatively high&#13;
per capita income. Residents from large cities and secondary school&#13;
repeaters tended to attend conventional schools and relatively to sons&#13;
of farmers those who attended INEMs most were, in order of importance,&#13;
sons of employees, manual workers and professionals.&#13;

IV. The Demand for Post-Secondary Education&#13;
The Colombian education system allows anyone holding a "bachiller"&#13;
degree to pursue further education. In the middle of the 1970s, INEM degrees&#13;
were recognized as such. This implies that INEM and non-INEM graduates have&#13;
the same possibilities of continuing on to post-secondary education. But&#13;
since INEM graduates have achieved some working skills that non-INEM students&#13;
do not have, it is possible to expect them to go to the labor market in a&#13;
higher proportion than non-INEM graduates. In addition, each INEM's&#13;
specialization was created to supply adequate labor force to those areas the&#13;
Colombian economy presumably needs the most. Therefore, INEM graduates are&#13;
expected to work in their area of specialization or to do further studies in&#13;
that area, while non-diversified secondary school graduates are more likely&#13;
to continue on to post-secondary education.&#13;
At the time of interview (1981) 50.8 percent of the sample reported&#13;
they were studying full-time or part-time. There are significant differences&#13;
in the probability of being a student in 1981, depending upon the type of&#13;
school attended or the subject followed in school. As shown in Table 7, INEM&#13;
students of the academic stream are the most likely to be studying three&#13;
years after graduation from secondary school relative to any other category&#13;
(3 out of 4). Those having the smallest probability of being students in&#13;
1981 are agricultural graduates of non-INEM schools (only 1 out of 5).&#13;

Table 8 shows the percentage of the 1978 cohort who in 1981 were&#13;
studying full-time, by school type and subject. INEM graduates of the&#13;
academic stream are again the ones with the highest likelihood of being&#13;
full-time students in 1981. They represents 56% of all those who followed&#13;
academic studies, while the corresponding percentage for control students is&#13;
only 38%. Agriculture is another subject where the difference between INEMs&#13;
and control school is marked. Of those INEM graduates who followed&#13;
agricultural studies more than 35% were studying full time in 1981 as&#13;
compared to only 15% for control students. In the other subjects of study&#13;
the difference goes in favor of traditional schools but the gap is not very&#13;
large. Overall the proportion of INEM graduates who ended up studying full&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
time is almost 7 percentage points larger than that of graduates from&#13;
traditional schools. It is interesting to note, however, that although&#13;
control schools seem to be sending a smaller proportion of their graduates to&#13;
further education, the quality of the education they obtain is not&#13;
necessarily worse than that received by INEM graduates. In particular, the&#13;
proportion of control students who in 1981 were enrolled in the best six&#13;
universities of Colombia was 6.7 percent, while the corresponding proportion&#13;
for INEM students was 6.1 percent. 3/&#13;

These figures seem to reject hypothesis (a) above. It is not clear&#13;
that diversification leads to less private demand for post-secondary&#13;
education. But Tables 7 and 8 do not control for factors other than subject&#13;
of study which may differ between INEMs and traditional schools, and which&#13;
could explain the higher rate of enrolment into full-time education of INEM&#13;
graduates. In order to isolate the effect of school type and subject, we&#13;
take into account the influence that other factors may also have on the&#13;
probability of being a full time student.&#13;
We estimate this probability in terms of a binary choice between&#13;
the alternative "Student Only" on the one hand, and the other three&#13;
alternatives - "Study and Work", "Work Only" and "Other" - on the other&#13;
hand. 4/ The individual's choice between these two alternatives will depend&#13;
4/ This is not the only way in which this problem could be approached. The&#13;
most general would consist in investigating the factors that at the&#13;
graduation point make people choose one of the four alternatives shown in&#13;
Figure 2 above, and then, subject to this first decision, to find out what&#13;
determines the second choice that leads to the current individual's&#13;
position. This way of posing the problem (which is discussed in more&#13;
detail in Annex 1) has the advantage of emphasizing the possibility of&#13;
state dependency that may exist in the data. Other things equal, the&#13;
probability of, say, being a worker in 1981 should be higher if a person&#13;
was a worker in 1978 than if this was not the case. The procedure,&#13;
however, in addition to requiring the use of multiple choice models (such&#13;
as multinomial probits or logits), could be hampered by the small sample&#13;
cells on which some of these probabilities would have to be estimated.&#13;
Even when using much more aggregated choices, we have found that the&#13;
distribution of missing observations in the present set of data reduces&#13;
very rapidly the available size. We thus propose to concentrate only on&#13;
the determinants of the 1981 position, and to model the individual's&#13;
behavior in terms of only binary choices. The first requirement may not&#13;
be very stringent in the light of the stability over time of employment&#13;
status that the data show (see Figure 2). The second simplification&#13;
could be more problematic because it will force us to bring together&#13;
altenatives which are not necessarily homogeneous, but given the&#13;
characteristics of the data there is little scope for narrower definitions&#13;
than the ones used below.&#13;

on a comparison of the net benefits associated to each of them. In this&#13;
particular case this comparison involves evaluating whether it is worthwhile&#13;
for the individual to postpone his (or her) entrance into paid work in&#13;
exchange for higher expected earnings after finishing post-secondary&#13;
studies. One way of modelling this choice would be to have a model of income&#13;
determination for each of these two alternatives and for each individual, and&#13;
to see the extent to which the discounted value of the net benefits&#13;
associated to each alternative was a relevant factor. Here, given the nature&#13;
of the data, we cannot use such a model. As we shall see below, we can&#13;
identify certain elements of the earnings structure associated to the working&#13;
alternative, but we do not know the factors determining post-university&#13;
income as our sample does not include information on this. So we approach&#13;
the problem in terms of a reduced-form framework, entering into the model not&#13;
the net benefits associated to each alternative, but the more basic&#13;
variables, like education and personal characteristics, which are likely to&#13;
determine these benefits. This of course does not allow us to identify&#13;
income elasticities for each of the relevant decisions, but in the context of&#13;
our problem this is not a severe limitation since our main objective is not&#13;
so much to identify these income elasticities as to evaluate whether and to&#13;
what extent the type of school from which an individual has graduated has any&#13;
influence on employment status.&#13;
The model used is described formally in Annex 2. Essentially, we&#13;
want to investigate which factors determine the probability that an&#13;
individual chooses to study (i.e., chooses to "Study Only") as opposed to&#13;
work (i.e., chooses to "Study and Work", "Work Only" or the "Other"&#13;
alternative). In additon to the 10 school type-subject of studies set of&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
dummies, we consider the following variables. 5/ First, a set of school and&#13;
locational variables. The attractiveness of further study will be positively&#13;
related to the quality of primary and secondary education, thus it is&#13;
important to consider explicitly variables that proxy educational quality.&#13;
We are only able to use information on whether the school is private or&#13;
public, and on whether it is rural or urban. Other available quality indices&#13;
such as student-teacher ratios, school expenditure per student etc., were&#13;
omitted because, due to missing values, their presence reduced to&#13;
unacceptable levels the sample size. Locational variables, such as the&#13;
economically active population and per capita income, are included to pick up&#13;
characteristics of the local labor market and therefore capture possible&#13;
demand forces which would make the "Work" alternative more attractive than&#13;
the "Study" alternative.&#13;
Then we consider a set of personal and family characteristics.&#13;
Age is likely to be an important variable; the older the individual is the&#13;
shorter the period of time over which he (or she) can recover the benefits of&#13;
further educational investments, and thus the more likely that he (or she)&#13;
will choose to work. Place of birth and years of residence are included to&#13;
capture possible effects that information on local labor markets may have on&#13;
the choice of whether to work or not. Repetition of years in either primary&#13;
or secondary school should indicate lack of individual academic ability and&#13;
thus favor the chances of work. Among family characteristics we include&#13;
parents schooling to proxy individual's ability and/or borrowing capacity;&#13;
5/ Note that all the variables included give information prior to the choice&#13;
being investigated. That is, we do not include variables such as&#13;
experience or hours of work because, although relevant to the&#13;
determination of earnings, they would introduce endogeneity in the present&#13;
analysis.&#13;

father's vocational training to capture possible intergenerational inertia in&#13;

Table 9 shows for males and females separately the effect that&#13;
these variables have on the probability of studying. Variables with a&#13;

variables on the vector determining the cut-off level of the probability&#13;
distribution; the actual effect on probabilities will be discussed below.&#13;

Age is an important determinant for both men and women, and takes&#13;
the expected negative sign; the older a person is, the lower the probability&#13;
that he (or she) will engage in full-time study after secondary education.&#13;
Males whose father is a professional have a higher probability of studying&#13;
than those whose father has a manual unskilled occupation (significant at the&#13;
10 percent level), urban schools appear to decrease the probability of&#13;
studying of female graduates, and finally per capita income in the city tend&#13;
to increase this probability. Among the educational dummies INEM x Academic&#13;
is the most important, significantly increasing the probability of full-time&#13;
study for both men and women. CONTROL x Academic and CONTROL x Social&#13;
Services also increase this probability (with respect to Pedagogy) but are&#13;
only significant in the case of women.&#13;
How significant are the differences betwen INEM's and traditional&#13;
schools spotted in Table 9? We answer this queston by reestimating again&#13;
these probits but now restricting the INEM and CONTROL coefficients in the&#13;
educational set of dummies to have the same value. (These estimates are not&#13;
shown as they are very similar to those in Table 9). If the restriction is&#13;
accepted then the hypothesis that INEMs have no differential effect cannot&#13;
be rejected. We test the restriction by means of a likelihood ratio which&#13;
turns out to be 16.2 for men and 10.4 for women. If the likelihood ratio&#13;
exceeds the critical value 11.1 then the restrictions are not accepted and&#13;
vice versa. 6/ Thus, the equality restriction is rejected for men and&#13;
6/ The likelihood ratio R is defined as R = -2 [log likelihood restricted&#13;
regression - log likelihood unrestricted regression3.    It is distributed&#13;
as a chi-square with 5 degrees of freedom, with a critical value at the&#13;
5 percent level of 11.1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
accepted for women. Thus, statistically speaking, we conclude that INEM's&#13;
have a positive differential effect on the probability of studying in the&#13;
case of male graduates, but not in the case of female graduates.&#13;
In the light of the results obtained in Table 9, this conclusion&#13;
may appear surprising, but there is an easy explanation for it. The&#13;
likelihood ratio test is a joint test of the differences of coefficients&#13;
between INEM variables and their corresponding control counterparts. It is&#13;
perfectly possible to have sigfnificant differences across subjects, as is&#13;
the case with women, and yet not to be able to establish for each subject a&#13;
difference depending on whether that subject has been studied in an INEM or&#13;
in a traditional school. In the case of women, the differences across three&#13;
subjects are significant but those across type of school are not. In the&#13;
case of men there is only one significant difference across subjects -&#13;
Academic -, but this is also significant across type of school.&#13;
The coefficients in Table 9 have a difficult interpretation as&#13;
they are only indirectly linked to the probability concept. So, in Table 10&#13;
we present a summary of the results in terms of the effects the different&#13;
educational variables have on the corresponding probability. The probabil-&#13;
ities are calculated for a typical individual who, other than the type of&#13;
school and the subject of study, which will vary, has the following&#13;
description. The individual studied in a public secondary school which was&#13;
located in an urban centre with 36.4 percent of active population and 1,595&#13;
Colombian Pesos per month per capita. He (or she) was born in a city, is 22&#13;
years old, resident in his (or her) current city for 18 years, had not&#13;
repeated any year in primary or secondary school, his (or her) parents had 10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
years of schooling each and finally his (or her) father had not received&#13;
vocational training and is in a manual skilled occupation.&#13;
Looking first at men we see that the typical individual's&#13;
probability of studying would be much larger if his academic studies had been&#13;
done in an INEM than if they had been done in a traditional school (42.9&#13;
percent as compared to 13.4 percent). The same is true of the typical&#13;
woman. She would have a probability of studying of only 4.6 percent if she&#13;
had done her academic studies in a traditional school, and of 15.2 percent if&#13;
she had done them in an INEM. This is probably the most important and&#13;
clear-cut result of this exercise. INEM students in the academic curriculum&#13;
have a significantly greater propensity to go on studying after graduation&#13;
than their counterparts from traditonal schools.&#13;

1.  These probabilities are calculated for an individual whose secondary&#13;
school was public and located in an urban centre with 36.4 percent of&#13;
active population and 1,595 Colombian Pesos per month per capita. The&#13;
individual was born in a city, was 22 years old, had resided in his (or&#13;
her) current city for 18 years, had not repeated any year in primary or&#13;
secondary school, his (or her) parents had 10 years of school each, his&#13;
(or her) father had not received vocational training and was a manual&#13;
skilled worker.&#13;

The table shows other interesting results. Except for commercial&#13;
studies, INEM male graduates have a higher probability of studying than&#13;
control students in all other aspects. This, together with the strong&#13;
difference in the academic curriculum, explains the significance of the joint&#13;
test described above. In the case of women the results are not so clear, and&#13;
in one instance - Social Services - the probability of studying among control&#13;
students is greater than that of INEM students.&#13;

The hypothesis that diversification reduces the demand for&#13;
post-secondary education is clearly rejected by the data. In the case of&#13;
women, the most favorable instance for the hypothesis, we cannot identify&#13;
any significant overall difference between diversified and non-diversified&#13;
schools. But in the case of men we find a statistically significant&#13;
difference and this goes the other way around. Diversified schools increase&#13;
rather than reduce the demand for post-secondary education.&#13;
It is difficult to interpret what this finding means without a more&#13;
detailed knowledge of the characteristics of INEM and traditional schools.&#13;
A possible interpretation is that INEMs are failing in achieving one of the&#13;
basic aim for which they were crated: to supply people to the labor market at&#13;
a higher rate than had been done by the traditional school system. But this&#13;
is not the only possible view. INEMs are new schools provided with better&#13;
and newer inputs than regular public and private schools, and this could have&#13;
meant an output of higher quality and thus equipping the graduate with a&#13;
comparative advantage over control students to pursue higher education.&#13;

V. Further Training&#13;
Out of the 1,826 respondents, 800 had undertaken a certain amount&#13;
of further training between graduation and the time of the interview. Most&#13;
of these 800 people were now either "working only" (43.5 percent) or "working&#13;
and studying" (25.0 percent). But there were also some of them who at the&#13;
time of the interview were "studying only" (19.0 percent) or in the "other"&#13;
category (12.5 percent).&#13;
Most of this further training takes place in SENA (Servicio&#13;
Nacional de Aprendizaje - National Apprenticenship Service), in Technical&#13;
Institutes, in Firms and in Universities. The rest takes place in other&#13;
centers which can be both private and public. Table 11 shows the&#13;
distribution of students undertaking training in these different places, by&#13;
school type.&#13;

One of the often stated aims of diversified schools is to enhance&#13;
the propensity of the student towards further training in the area of his/her&#13;
specialization. So, it is important to investigate the extent to which INEMs&#13;
performed better than traditional schools in this respect, and the degree of&#13;
consistency between field of specialization and training among INEM and&#13;
control students.&#13;
The average length of further training in 19.7 weeks for INEM&#13;
graduates and 12.8 weeks for conventional school graduates. Therefore, the&#13;
data seem to confirm the presumption that INEMs do better than control&#13;
schools in this respect. Table 12 shows that this advantage is quite&#13;
general, with INEM graduates undertaking more training than control graduates&#13;
whatever the field of specialization. However, except for commercial and&#13;
social services studies, the difference is not very great. These results are&#13;
largely maintained when the comparison is adjusted for other factors through&#13;
regression analysis. Then the average length of further training for INEMs&#13;
is 19.9 weeks and that of control schools 13.1 weeks. The difference in&#13;
school type and subject are the main explanatory variables.&#13;
The figures shown in Table 12 are the averages of weeks of training&#13;
calculated over both those who undertake and those who do not undertake&#13;
training. They therefore reflect the true extent of the difference that&#13;
exist between INEMs and control schools in this respect. It is interesting,&#13;
however, to discern whether this difference is due to more graduates&#13;
undertaking training or to a greater length of the duration of training among&#13;
those who choose to undertake training.&#13;

Table 13 shows again the mean duration of training, but now only&#13;
for those who actually undertook training. It also shows the proportion of&#13;
graduates of each subject who undertook training. The results suggest that&#13;
INEMs advantage over control schools is maintained, and that this advantage&#13;
is due not so much to the fact that relatively more INEM graduates undertake&#13;
training (the difference here is relatively small), but to the fact that&#13;
among those who choose further training, the length is much longer for INEM&#13;
than for control graduates (42 weeks as opposed to 29 weeks). Except for&#13;
commercial studies, the proportion of students taking further training is&#13;
always greater for control schools than for INEMs. But this is clearly&#13;
compensated by the much longer duration of the courses taken by INEM&#13;
graduates, again with the exception of commercial studies where the mean&#13;
length of courses is very similar.&#13;

A piece of revealing evidence about the nature of INEMs is given by&#13;
the extent to which their graduates undertake pre-university courses. A&#13;
pre-university course is usually a short term course (less than a year)&#13;
destined to prepare secondary school graduates for university entrance&#13;
examination, and consists of a review of topics which are relevant for the&#13;
first year of a university degree. These are courses of essentially a&#13;
remedial character and it is interesting to note, as Table 14 shows, that&#13;
INEM Academic graduates undertake these courses to a significantly lower&#13;
extent than control Academic graduates. This, together with the fact&#13;
analyzed above that INEM Academic graduates attend university in a larger&#13;
proportion than control Academic graduates, reinforces our previous&#13;
presumption about the higher educational quality of INEMs.&#13;

Finally, Table 15 shows the extent to which field of specialization&#13;
and further training are matched for INEM and control graduates. The overall&#13;
degree of matching is fairly good. Leaving aside education, which is an area&#13;
of training in which all subjects of study are well represented, we tend to&#13;
find that there is a certain congruence between what a graduate studied and&#13;
his or her further training. For instance, graduates from commercial&#13;
subjects tend to do further training in Economic and Business Administration,&#13;
while those from industrial subjects concentrate in Engineering. The degree&#13;
of matching is of course not perfect but it clearly differs from a random&#13;
allocation. The data also show that, particularly in those subjects of&#13;
specialty where the degree of congruence is highest (Commercial and&#13;
Industrial), the differences between INEMs and control schools are not very&#13;
important.&#13;

VI. Labor Force Participation&#13;
We turn now to the differential influence that INEMs may have had&#13;
over traditional schools on labor force participation. To some extent this&#13;
question has already been investigated in Section IV above, when analysing&#13;
the determinants of the choice between the alternatives "studying" and "not&#13;
studying". The problem is that there we focussed our attention on the first&#13;
of these two alternatives, and included in the second, types of status which&#13;
were quite different among themselves. Here we want to define the working&#13;
status in a more homogeneous fashion and see what factors determine whether&#13;
or not a graduate will choose to work.&#13;
The first issue we have to deal with is the definition of labor&#13;
force participation. If we define a labor market participant as an&#13;
individual who is either working (full or part-time) or looking for work, we&#13;
find that 70% of the respondents belong to this category. The distribution&#13;
of participants by school type and subject of study is given in Table 16.&#13;
There are less labor force participants among those who studied at INEMs,&#13;
67.4%, then among those who studied at conventional schools, 73.0%. This is&#13;
consistent with the results obtained in Section IV, where we saw that the&#13;
demand propensity for higher education was higher for INEM than for control&#13;
graduates. Control students have much higher participation rates in&#13;
Academic, Agriculture and Social Services Studies and slightly lower&#13;
participation rates in Commerce and Industry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Overall                    67.4              73.0           70.4&#13;
The problem with this concept of labor force participation is that&#13;
it includes people who may be in very different circumstances. At the early&#13;
stages of a working life, it is not surprising that people see themselves as&#13;
not settled, and thus as looking for a job, whatever their actual status. To&#13;
remedy this, we show in Table 17 a more strictly defined measure of labor&#13;
force participation: the proportion of respondents who in 1981 were working&#13;
either full or part time. We find that only 58.8% of the sample belong to&#13;
this category, and that control graduates maintain their advantage with a&#13;
participation rate of 61.6% as compared to only 55.8% for INEM graduates.&#13;
The differences across subject of study are now uniform, with control&#13;
graduates never showing a lower work propensity than INEM graduates in all&#13;
subjects of study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
The differences shown in Table 17 could be due to the variation of&#13;
factors other than school type and subject of study. So we need to&#13;
standardize for these factors in order to reach a clearer picture of the&#13;
isolated influence of diversified schools. We approach the problem by means&#13;
of a probit analysis similar to that presented in Section IV above, when&#13;
analyzing the demand for post-secondary education. The binary choice in this&#13;
case is between working ("Study and Work" or "Work Only") and not working&#13;
("Study Only" or "Other"), and the variables considered are the same as those&#13;
described in Section IV. Table 18 shows the results obtained.&#13;

For males, with the exception of Commercial studies, all other&#13;
subjects are associated to a lower probability of work than Pedagogy (the&#13;
base category), but in general the differences are not significant. Only&#13;
male INEM graduates from Academic studies have a significantly lower&#13;
probability of work than Pedagogy graduates. Among the school or locational&#13;
variables the only significant variable is the proportion of active&#13;
population in the city which has the expected positive effect. Age also&#13;
shows the expected positive effect on the probability of work and is strongly&#13;
significant. The other variables are in general working in the expected&#13;
direction but their effect is statistically negligible (with the possible&#13;
exception of "Father's Occupation Professional", which is almost significant&#13;
at the 10 percent level).&#13;
The results for women are similar as regards to the non-educational&#13;
variables, with only age exerting a significant effect, but are much better&#13;
determined in the case of the school type-subject set of dummies. All&#13;
specialties are associated with a lower probability of work than Pedagogy,&#13;
and significantly so in the case of INEM's. In the case of traditional&#13;
schools only the Academic curriculum exerts a significant negative effect.&#13;
Despite being more narrowly defined than labor force participation&#13;
the choice modelled in Table 18 could still be too heterogenous. In Table 19&#13;
we correct this somewhat, by concentrating on the determinants of the&#13;
probability of "Working Only". That is, the probability that in 1981 an&#13;
individual will be observed in that category as opposed to the other three&#13;
alternatives. The results are consistent with those in Table 18 but, at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
least for men, the new choice seems much more relevant than the one modelled&#13;
before. Now we are able to spot five significant differences on the&#13;
educational set of dummies. The most interesting finding is that while the&#13;
probability that Academic INEM graduates will be "Working Only" in 1981 is&#13;
significantly smaller than that for Pedagogy graduates, the corresponding&#13;
probability for Academic graduates from conventional schools is&#13;
significantly larger. For women the differences spotted earlier disappear&#13;
somewhat, which indicates that whether they graduate from INEMs or not may&#13;
have an influence on choosing work and study combined, but not on choosing&#13;
the alternative "Work Only".&#13;
We reestimated again the probits in Tables 18 and 19 but&#13;
restricting the INEM and control coefficients in the educational set of&#13;
dummies to be equal, in order to test whether the differences between INEMs&#13;
and conventional schools are significant. The likelihood ratios for the&#13;
choice specified in Table 18 are 12.8 for men and 8.6 for women, and those&#13;
for Table 19 are 32.4 for men and 5.8 for women. We again have as when&#13;
analyzing the choice between "Studying" and "Not Studying", that the equality&#13;
restriction is rejected for men and accepted for women. Therefore, we&#13;
conclude that INEMs have a negative effect on the probability of working of&#13;
male graduates which is statistically significant. For female graduates, on&#13;
the other hand, the data reject the hypothesis that INEMs have any&#13;
differential effect on employment status.&#13;

Finally, we show in Table 20 the predicted probabilities of work&#13;
which are implied by the results in Table 18 and 19. These probabilities are&#13;
calculated for a typical individual who has the same characteristics as those&#13;
defined in Table 10 of Section IV.   Looking first at men we see that the&#13;
typical individual's probability of "Working Only" would be much smaller if&#13;
his academic studies had been done in an INEM than if they had been done in a&#13;
traditional school (6.4 percent as compared to 37.5 percent). This is&#13;
consistent with the results found in Section IV above. There we calculated&#13;
that for this individual the probability of "Studying Only" was much larger&#13;
if the academic curriculum had been followed in an INEM than if it had been&#13;
followed in a traditional school (42.9 percent as opposed to 13.4 percent).&#13;
So that result together with the ones reported in Table 20 confirm the&#13;
conclusion that INEM graduates, except if they had specialized in commercial&#13;
studies, have a lower probability of "Working only", and a higher probability&#13;
of "Studying Only", than graduates from traditional schools. In the case of&#13;
commercial studies, on the other hand, INEM graduates are more likely to&#13;
concentrate on full-time work than graduates from conventional schools (a&#13;
41.7 percent probability as compared to a 18.7 percent probability).&#13;

school was public and located in an urban centre with 36.4 percent of&#13;
active population and 1,595 Colombian Pesos per month per capita. The&#13;
individual was born in a city, was 22 years old, had resided in his (or&#13;
her) current city for 18 years, had not repeated any year in primary or&#13;
secondary school, his (or her) parents had 10 years of school each, his&#13;
(or her) father had not received vocational training and was a manual&#13;
skilled worker.&#13;

For women the differences are mainly across subjects rather than&#13;
across types of school, and they show up more strongly when the joint&#13;
alternative "Study and Work" or "Work Only" is considered, than when "Work&#13;
Only" is analyzed separately. The academic curriculum is associated with a&#13;

significantly lower probability of work than the pedagogy curriculum, and&#13;
this is true of both INEMs and traditional schools although the lowest&#13;
probability (as in the case of men) is found among INEM graduates. We also&#13;
find that, although to a lower extent than academic studies, commercial,&#13;
agricultural and social services studies are all associated with a&#13;
probability of work smaller than that of pedagogical studies. It must be&#13;
said, however, that female graduates from pedagogy have a very high&#13;
probability of being engaged in some sort of work after their secondary&#13;
studies (72.6 percent), and it is therefore not surprising to find&#13;
significantly lower probabilities for graduates from other curricula.&#13;

VII. Job Search and Unemployment&#13;
Almost 18 percent of the entire cohort reported they were looking&#13;
for a job in 1981, with a very small overall difference between INEMs and&#13;
control schools (18.4 percent in INEMs and 17.4 in control schools).&#13;
However, most of those looking for a job were either already holding a job or&#13;
were studying. As Table 21 shows, out of the 325 individuals who identified&#13;
themselves as job searchers, 214 were employed in some sort of activity or&#13;
were studying. It is therefore difficult to give a precise meaning to this&#13;
figure. More than meaning unemployment (although even this term is not&#13;
without ambiguity), this figure is probably simply reflecting the normal&#13;
period of trial which young workers tend to go through at the beginning of&#13;
their active life. 7/.&#13;
7/ It may also indicate dissatisfaction with present status and thus give&#13;
some idea of the expectations that graduates hold. It is interesting to&#13;
note in this respect that INEM graduates not only look for alternative&#13;
jobs in a relatively larger number than control graduates, but also&#13;
expect to obtain a higher salary. The reservation monthly wage reported&#13;
by INEM graduates looking for a job was 13,700 pesos, while that&#13;
reported by control graduates was 12,500 pesos. This compares with&#13;
actual monthly wages of around 10,000 pesos for both types of graduates.&#13;

Note:&#13;
These figures correspond to the number of respondent who were looking&#13;
for a job in 1981, irrespective of whether they were also studying or&#13;
working.&#13;
A probably more reliable indicator of difficulty in finding a job&#13;
is given by the percentage of respondents who in 1981 were looking for a job&#13;
and were not working or studying. Overall, 6 percent of the cohort were in&#13;
this situation and Table 22 shows how they were distributed across school&#13;
type and subject of study. The first point to notice is that the&#13;
differences between INEMs and control schools is very small (5.8 percent as&#13;
compared to 6.2 percent). This, however, marks some important divergencies&#13;
across the different subjects of study. Academic and Agricultural graduates&#13;
do much worse in terms of unemployment if they come from a control school&#13;
than if they come from an INEM, whereas Commercial and Industrial graduates&#13;
from control schools do better than their counterparts from INEMs. Finally,&#13;
the ordering of subjects according to the incidence of unemployment is not&#13;
the same in the two types of school. INEM Academic graduates are the ones&#13;
who suffer less unemployment and Agricultural graduates are the ones who&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
suffer most. In control schools, Academic graduates show the second highest&#13;
unemployment rate after Agricultural graduates, and Industrial graduates the&#13;
lowest.&#13;

Note:  We classify as unemployed those respondents who in 1981 were looking&#13;
for a job and were not studying or working.&#13;
Although the overall difference in unemployment rates between INEMs&#13;
and control schools is not large, the difference by sex is more marked. Male&#13;
graduates from INEMs, in particular, seem to do much better than their&#13;
counterparts from control schools. The percentage unemployed from the INEM&#13;
cohort of males was 5.5 and that for the control cohort 7.0. Female INEM&#13;
graduates, on the other hand, are more likely to be unemployed than female&#13;
graduates from traditional schools, but the difference is small. In 1981, 19&#13;
female INEM graduates were unemployed (6.4 percent of the female INEM&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
cohort), while the corresponding number for female graduates from&#13;
traditional schools was 31 (5.5 percent). 8/&#13;
Another important variable in this survey, which also gives&#13;
information as to the readiness with which graduates are integrated into the&#13;
labor market, is the period of time that each graduate had to wait to find&#13;
his (or her) first job. If training on the job is a relevant factor in this&#13;
market, this variable ought to have also an influence on the level of&#13;
earnings observed for each working individual in 1981. Other things equal&#13;
one should expect higher earnings for individuals with longer market&#13;
experience. We leave the detailed analysis of this issue until the next&#13;
section and here we concentrate on the distribution of this variable across&#13;
school type, employment status and sex.&#13;
Table 23 shows the average number of weeks that it took people to&#13;
find their first job. Since this information is likely to be of more&#13;
difficult interpretation in the case of self-employed graduates, we&#13;
concentrate here on employees only.&#13;
8/ The results obtained so far do not change practically at all when other&#13;
variables are taken into account. The probability of looking for a job&#13;
is significantly reduced if the individual is a male, and depends&#13;
inversely on the per capita income of the city of residence and on the&#13;
number of post-secondary courses taken. These influences, however, are&#13;
not sufficiently strong to alter the pattern given by Table 22 above.&#13;

1. Figures in parenthesis are the number of cases over which the&#13;
corresponding means have been calculated.&#13;
2. The sum of observations "INEM" plus "Control" do not add up to "All"&#13;
because overall there are 14 observations that cannot be identified&#13;
as belonging to an INEM or a control school.&#13;
3. Employment status refers to the individual's position in October&#13;
1981.&#13;
4. The figures refer to employees only.&#13;
There are several interesting points to note in this table. First,&#13;
we find that on average the amount of time that elapsed between graduation&#13;
(December 1978) and the beginning of the first job is not negligable. For&#13;
the whole sample it stands at about 3 months, which represents almost 9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
percent of the maximum span of time that goes from graduation to the point at&#13;
which individuals were observed. Second, the data suggest that male&#13;
graduates have less difficulty in finding their first job than female&#13;
graduates, particularly in the case of traditional schools; in INEMs the&#13;
overall difference is not very large and in fact for those graduates who&#13;
exclusively work, men waited on average longer than women. Third, graduates&#13;
who combine work with studies wait on average less than graduates who&#13;
specialize on work. This is not surprising, as it is likely that the former&#13;
regard their jobs as provisional and are therefore less choosy than those who&#13;
devote their whole time to work. Fourth, overall INEM graduates found their&#13;
first jobs quicker than Control graduates (about two weeks earlier on&#13;
average). This advantage is fairly consistent across categories of work and&#13;
sex, with the exception of males exclusively working, for whom the period of&#13;
waiting time is almost two weeks longer.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
VIII. Labor Earnings&#13;
The next issue we want to look into is the level of earnings&#13;
obtained by those graduates who in 1981 were working. As we have seen in&#13;
Section VI above, the probability that INEM graduates enter the labor force&#13;
after post-secondary education is lower than that for control graduates,&#13;
particularly in the case of men. It might be that INEMs send less people to&#13;
the labor market, but that those who end up there are more productive, and&#13;
thus command higher earnings, than graduates from traditional schools. Table&#13;
24 shows earnings by employment status, type of school and sex. Looking&#13;
first at employees and self-employed workers (first three columns) we see&#13;
that the general pattern is the following: INEM male graduates earn more, and&#13;
INEM female graduates less, than their counterparts from traditional schools,&#13;
and overall INEM graduates earn slightly more than graduates from traditional&#13;
schools. This pattern is the same whatever the employment status considered,&#13;
although the magnitude of the differences varies somewhat. The INEM&#13;
advantage in the case of males is greater when graduates combine work and&#13;
study than when they only work. For males who work and study, INEM graduates&#13;
earn 7.3 percent more than Control graduates, and for males that only work,&#13;
INEM graduates earn 5.5 percent more than Control graduates. For females the&#13;
INEM disadvantage is greater in the case of "Work Only" (-9.4 percent) than&#13;
in the case of "Study and Work" (-2.1 percent).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
The INEM's advantage over traditional schools in the case of males,&#13;
however, is largely due to the effect of earnings by people who define&#13;
themselves as self-employed. Since earnings reported by self-employed&#13;
workers are not always reliable, and since it is unlikely that whatever&#13;
genuine difference may remain is due to the different type of schooling&#13;
received, a more accurate picture of the INEM-Control comparison may be&#13;
obtained from the sample including only employees. Excluding self-employed&#13;
people (last three columns of Table 24) does substantially reduce the INEM&#13;
advantage for males (in the category "Work Only" it does even reverse the&#13;
sign), and leaves more or less unchanged the previous results concerning&#13;
female graduates. Including self-employed people, INEM male graduates who&#13;
only worked were earning 5.5 percent more than Control graduates in this&#13;
category; now, excluding self-employed people, they earn 2.2 percent less.&#13;
Also the previous results suggested that INEM male graduates who combined&#13;
work and study were earning 7.3 percent more than Control graduates; now,&#13;
excluding self-employed, they only earn 5.1 percent more.&#13;
The two remaining features of Table 24 worth noting are the higher&#13;
earnings reported by male graduates and the fact that graduates who combine&#13;
study and work tend to earn more than graduates who only work. The first&#13;
feature is not surprising and it is found in most earnings surveys both in&#13;
developed and developing countries. The magnitude of the difference,&#13;
however, is probably much larger than what we would expect to find in&#13;
developed countries. It must be noticed that this is a very homogenous&#13;
sample in terms of education level and market experience; in developed&#13;
countries, sex differences for equally educated people tend to be small at&#13;
the beginning of the working career and grow when women start to drop from&#13;
the labor force for reasons related to childbirth and childcare.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
The second feature is unexpected. In principle it would seem that&#13;
people combining work and study would be found in temporary and dead-end type&#13;
of jobs to a greater extent than people exclusively working. But this is not&#13;
the case for these data, and the higher earnings in the category "Study and&#13;
Work" is quite consistent whatever the sex of the individual or the type of&#13;
secondary school attended.&#13;
Earnings differences between INEMs and traditional schools are&#13;
therefore not very large. As far as men are concerned the differences that&#13;
are observed seem to be explained almost totally by the effect of&#13;
self-employed individuals, and concerning women it appears that traditional&#13;
school graduates do somewhat better. This, of course, is a preliminary&#13;
conclusion based only on the limited amount of standardization performed in&#13;
Table 24. There could be systematic differences in other variables across&#13;
INEM and Control schools which also need to be taken into account.&#13;
Before entering into this analysis, however, it should be noted&#13;
that the survey to which these data belong also gives information on the&#13;
earnings that individuals had in their first job after graduation. Thus, we&#13;
could potentially use this longitudinal aspect of the sample to improve the&#13;
estimates of the determinants of earnings. However, this information, which&#13;
is retrospective, is not without problems. Retrospective information always&#13;
tends to be less reliable than information on current magnitudes, but the&#13;
problem is aggravated when the variables involved are nominal and when the&#13;
context to which they refer is inflationary. Then the tendency is to&#13;
overestimate the real value of the variable in question. To see whether that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
was the case here, we expressed earnings in the first job in Colombian pesos&#13;
of 1981, using the Index of Consumer Prices and the information on time of&#13;
search to obtain that job. Then we compared real earnings in 1978 with real&#13;
earnings in 1981, and found that for a substantial proportion of people (42.4&#13;
percent) earnings had gone down in real terms. It is unlikely that this is&#13;
just a consequence of a general fall in productivity. Even if overall real&#13;
wages had been falling during this period, we would expect real earnings to&#13;
grow for most people as the largest gains resulting from market experience&#13;
are usually obtained during the early stages of the individual's working&#13;
life. 9/&#13;
These results suggest that, in examining the determinants of&#13;
earnings, it may be advisable to concentrate only on the information&#13;
referring to October 1981. To analyse employment status, on the other hand,&#13;
we believe that the information referring to December 1978 is quite reliable,&#13;
and to that extent we think that the results shown in Figures 2 to 5 above&#13;
are certainly useful for evaluation purposes.&#13;
Do INEMs play a significant role in the determination of earnings,&#13;
once the influence of other possible determinants has been accounted for?&#13;
This is the sort of question we would like to answer in the remainder of this&#13;
section. The most widely used model of earnings determination singles out&#13;
education and on-the-job training as the main factors determining earning&#13;
capacity (Mincer, 1974). Under perfectly competitive conditions, and for a&#13;
9/ To ensure that this result was not due to the inclusion of people&#13;
engaged in temporary jobs of work, we performed the same calculation&#13;
for the sample of people who were in the category "Work Only" in both&#13;
periods. For this subsample the proportion of individuals whose real&#13;
earnings in 1978 was greater than their real earnings in 1981 was 41.0&#13;
percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
given level of ability, these two variables are good predictors of individual&#13;
productivity levels. If, however, individuals cannot invest in education as&#13;
much as they would like (because of capital market imperfections), if the&#13;
labor market is segmented or if the distribution of tastes across types of&#13;
jobs is not uniform, then variables other than education and training may be&#13;
relevant in determining earnings.&#13;
In the present sample the main source of variation in educational&#13;
inputs is given by the presence of individuals graduated from both INEM's and&#13;
traditional schools. If we are able to isolate a differential effect on&#13;
earnings this may be indicative of possible differences in quality between&#13;
these two educational modalities. Also, besides the division between INEM&#13;
and Control graduates, we know the subject of study on which they&#13;
specialized. The effect of INEMs need not be uniform across subjects of&#13;
study, so we may capture the variations in educational quality by&#13;
distinguishing not only between INEMs and traditional schools but also,&#13;
within these two categories, between the six subjects of study.&#13;
Despite the homogeneity of the sample in terms of education and&#13;
age, we are fortunate to have at our disposal a reasonable proxy for&#13;
on-the-job training, which we obtain from the potential amount of individual&#13;
labor market experience. As explained above, we know for each person how&#13;
long he or she had to wait to obtain the first job. This, together with the&#13;
date of observation (October 1981) and the date of graduation (December&#13;
1978), allows us to construct a measure of the maximum span of time that each&#13;
individual may have spent in the market. Naturally, there may have been&#13;
periods of inactivity within this span of time which are not captured by this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
proxy, but we believe that on the whole it is better to use this information&#13;
than to assume that all individuals have the same labor market experience.&#13;
Although the period between graduation and observation is not long, there is&#13;
a reasonable amount of variation in potential experience; it ranges from a&#13;
minimum of 11 months to a maximum of 2 years and 10 months, and the&#13;
coefficient of variation is 13.9 percent. In addition to potential&#13;
experience there exist other variables which may also proxy accumulated&#13;
training: age, weeks of formal training after high school, and tenure in&#13;
current job.&#13;
A third group of variables that we consider consists of standard-&#13;
izing factors that are meant to account for the particular characteristics of&#13;
either the data set or the Colombian labor market. The first is hours of&#13;
work which is included because the dependent variable is measured in terms of&#13;
earnings rather than wages. The second is a dummy variable for&#13;
self-employment designed to isolate the specific effect that this type of&#13;
worker may have on average earnings; in general, information on self-employed&#13;
people tends to be less reliable than that on employees. The sample also&#13;
includes among wage earners people who combine work and study; since the&#13;
employment status (and associated earnings) of these individuals could differ&#13;
from that of people specializing on work for reasons other than education or&#13;
training we include another dummy to account for their presence in the&#13;
sample. Finally, we consider a third dummy which captures the possibility&#13;
that private and public jobs pay differently for reasons again unconnected&#13;
with education or training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
The fourth and last group of variables that we are going to&#13;
consider are parental and other socio-economic background factors which are&#13;
meant to capture part of the sample variation in individual ability and/or in&#13;
access to capital. Among a whole battery of indicators, the ones that are&#13;
used in this analysis are the level of schooling of the individual's parents,&#13;
dummies for repetition of years of study in secondary and primary school and&#13;
the individual's father occupation. 10/&#13;
Table 25 shows, for male graduates, the results of regressing the&#13;
log of monthly earnings on this set of variables. We present separate&#13;
regressions for men and women because, as will become evident below, the&#13;
earnings structures of men and women are different, and combining both sexes&#13;
into the same analysis would have tended to confound the results. In column&#13;
(1) we show a specification with all the variables described above and in&#13;
column (2) we present a simpler equation which omits insignificant&#13;
variables. We allow for the possibility that INEM effects operate not only&#13;
through the constant term of the equation but also through any of the&#13;
training and standardizing variables associated with the individual's labour&#13;
market experience after graduation. 11/ The interactive specification&#13;
allows us to identify separately the INEM and control coefficients and is&#13;
used in preference to other forms which would only identify differential&#13;
effects between schools type. Finally, the male regressions do not include&#13;
socio-economic variables as these proved to be very insignificant in&#13;
preliminary estimations.&#13;
10/ A whole battery of additional variables was tried in prior&#13;
experimentation, but in all cases the results were extremely&#13;
insignificant.&#13;
11/ An exception to this is the log of hours which in preliminary&#13;
specifications always showed a very similar effect whatever the school&#13;
type.&#13;

The first result worth noting is that there are very few&#13;
significant variables (although in all cases the equations as a whole are&#13;
significant). Other things equal, all subjects of study yield the same level&#13;
of earnings with the only exception of Agricultural studies in traditional&#13;
schools, which are associated with significantly lower earnings than the&#13;
rest.&#13;
The variable years of labor market experience" shows the expected&#13;
positive sign and is significant both for INEMs and for traditional schools.&#13;
The point estimate of the annual rate of growth of earnings is larger for&#13;
Control schools than for INEMs, but the gap is not very wide. It is&#13;
interesting to note that the rate of gain per year of experience is quite&#13;
large (26 percent in the case of INEMs and 33.5 percent in the case of&#13;
traditional schools). This is not surprising as most of the gains in&#13;
earnings are usually made at the beginning of the individual's working life.&#13;
We attempted to estimate the degree of curvature of the earnings profile by&#13;
including quadratic terms, but were unable to do so due to the small&#13;
variation present in the sample. 12/ We are confident however that the&#13;
results obtained identify fairly well the rate of growth of the profile&#13;
during the first three years of work. The other three training variables, on&#13;
the other hand, prove to be very unimportant as far as earnings determination&#13;
is concerned.&#13;
12/ Due to small variation, the variables "years of experience" and "years&#13;
of experience" - squared are highly correlated and introducing both of&#13;
them in the regression results in multicollinearity rendering&#13;
insignificant both coefficients.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
Among the standardizing variables the most important in magnitude&#13;
is that capturing INEM graduates who are currently self-employed, which is&#13;
consistent with our results in Table 24. Also, we find that private firms&#13;
tend to pay less than public firms, and that this difference is significant&#13;
in the case of graduates from traditional schools. Not surprisingly, the&#13;
longer an individual works the more he earns. It should be noticed, however,&#13;
that the coefficient on the log of hours is very low; normally, we would&#13;
expect it to be much nearer to one. This result is indicative of a very&#13;
large negative correlation between wages and hours and this, in turn,&#13;
suggests that hours of work may have been measured with substantial&#13;
error. 13/ Finally, we see that, once all these variables have been taken&#13;
into account, the fact that a graduate works only or combines work and study&#13;
does not matter as far as his earnings are concerned. 14/&#13;
In column (2) we omit all the insignificant variables and only&#13;
enter the pairs in which at least one of them is significant. The estimates&#13;
prove to be very stable and the only noticeable change occurs with the&#13;
coefficient on years of experience for control graduates, which now becomes&#13;
even more similar than before to the corresponding INEM effect.&#13;
13/ The correlation coefficient between wages and hours is -0.45 for the&#13;
1981 observations and -0.65 for the 1978 observations.&#13;
14/ We tested for selectivity bias following the Heckman (1979) procedure&#13;
and found that this problem was of no significance for the present set&#13;
of data.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
The results, therefore, point to very few differences between&#13;
INEM and traditional schools. But are the differences that remain&#13;
statistically significant? We answered this question by running again&#13;
equations (1) and (2) constraining the coefficients on INEM and Control&#13;
variables to be the same. Then we performed an F-test to see whether the&#13;
increment in the residual that results from the restriction is significant or&#13;
not. If significant, it means that the restrictions are not accepted and&#13;
thus that INEM and Control schools have a differential effect; if, on the&#13;
other hand, the incremental residual is not significant the hypothesis that&#13;
INEM and Control schools have the same effect on earnings cannot be&#13;
rejected. For the large specification the F statistic F(12,286) was 1.66&#13;
while the corresponding critical value is 1.79; for the small specification&#13;
the F statistic F(4,294) was 0.74 and the critical value 2.37. So in neither&#13;
case are the restrictions rejected. We then conclude that, statistically,&#13;
there are no differences in the effect that INEM's and traditional schools&#13;
have on male earnings.&#13;
Table 26 presents the equivalent analysis for female earnings.&#13;
Here we include a set of family background variables as they appear to be&#13;
more important than in the case of men. As for men, there are few&#13;
differences among subjects of study. Only graduates from traditional schools&#13;
in Commercial studies do earn significantly more than the rest. All other&#13;
specialities yield about the same level of earnings. The training variables&#13;
have a weaker effect on earnings than in the case of men. Years of&#13;
experience, in particular, is now insignificant in both INEMs and traditional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
schools. This result - flatter earnings profile for females - is again&#13;
consistent with findings from other data sets. Another difference with&#13;
respect to men is the effect of tenure which although insignificant in the&#13;
case of INEM graduates, it is quite important and takes the expected sign for&#13;
graduates from traditional schools.&#13;
Among the standardizing variables, private employment for control&#13;
graduates is again significantly associated to lower earnings, while the&#13;
effect of hours is also positive and significant. But, contrary to the male&#13;
results, we now find that female graduates that combine work and study tend&#13;
to earn more than those who only work, particularly in the case of&#13;
traditional schools. Finally, the socio-economic variables all tend to get&#13;
the expected sign (the only exception being the level of schooling of&#13;
mothers) but they are usually insignificant. Only "father's education" is&#13;
positively and significantly associated to earnings.&#13;
We also run for women the regressions in Table 26 but with the&#13;
effects of INEM and Control variables restricted to be the same. On the&#13;
basis of the F-test we conclude again that we cannot reject these&#13;
restrictions. 15/ That is, statistically, there are no significant&#13;
differences in the effect that INEMs and traditional schools have on&#13;
earnings.&#13;
15/ For the large specification the F statistic, F(12,254), was 0.71, and&#13;
for the small specification, F(4,276), 1.70. None of them is&#13;
statistically significant at the 5 percent level.&#13;

Although our main conclusion points to the inexistence of&#13;
significant differences, it is nonetheless interesting to calculate the&#13;
standardized earnings that follow from the point estimates just obtained.&#13;
Panel A of Table 27 shows the standardized earnings for each subject of&#13;
study. 16/ For men the highest earnings are obtained by those specializing&#13;
in industrial studies, particularly when studying this curriculum in&#13;
traditional schools. Academic studies yield earnings below the mean, but it&#13;
should be noted that the most able students in this category would be&#13;
"Studying Only" and therefore are not included in this regression. The only&#13;
noticeable difference is that of graduates having specialised in Agricultural&#13;
studies, who earn significantly less than the base group (Pedagogy). The&#13;
main difference as far as women are concerned is the significantly higher&#13;
earnings obtained by graduates from Commercial curricula in traditional&#13;
schools. The differences obtained for graduates from Industrial curricula&#13;
are based on very few observations and should not be given any weight.&#13;
16/ These earnings have been adjusted to yield the overall mean for the&#13;
whole sample (excluding Pedagogy), because the missing observations in&#13;
the regression analysis tend to understate mean earnings somewhat.&#13;
This does not affect the structure of standardized earnings, which is&#13;
our main concern here, and allows us to give a more precise meaning to&#13;
the rates of return calculated in the next section, which are based on&#13;
a comparison with undstandardized earnings of individual with primary&#13;
education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
Standardizing over the whole subject distribution we find, as in&#13;
Table 24 above, that male graduates from INEMs earn more and female graduates&#13;
from INEMs less than their counterparts from traditional schools. The&#13;
differences are small and, we repeat, statistically insignificant. Finally,&#13;
in Panel B, we aggregate the male and female figures using for both school&#13;
types the sample proportions of Table 24 and conclude that the (statistically&#13;
insignificant) advantage of traditional schools over INEMs is of 183&#13;
Colombian pesos per month.&#13;

IX. An Economic Evaluation of Diversified Education&#13;
We know the difference in earnings that can be attributed to school&#13;
type. If we had data on cost differences we would be able to evaluate the&#13;
return of the resources employed in each of these two types of education.&#13;
This, by necessity, must be a tentative exercise. As we have seen in the&#13;
previous section, earning differences as a whole are not statistically&#13;
different between INEMs and control schools; and even when looking at subject&#13;
of study, we have only found statistically significant differences for men&#13;
who have followed Agricultural studies in INEMs (who earn less than the rest&#13;
of men) and for women who have followed commercial studies in control schools&#13;
(who earn more than the rest of women). Thus, the returns from these types&#13;
of education ought to be heavily dominated by the cost of providing each of&#13;
them. As a general rough rule, and with the exceptions of Agricultural&#13;
studies and Commerce, it could be said that the lower the social cost, the&#13;
more efficient the provision of a given type of education.&#13;
Table 28 provides a comparison of adjusted earnings by subject of&#13;
study, aggregating both male and female students. The figures are derived&#13;
from Table 27, using sample weights for each subject, in order to control for&#13;
differences in sex composition between INEMs and control schools. Adjusted&#13;
earnings are lower in INEMs for Academic, Commercial and Industrial studies,&#13;
and higher for Agricultural and Social Services. The largest difference is&#13;
the 23.1 percent advantage of INEM Agricultural graduates. But given that&#13;
only about 14 percent of the sample respondents were in this category, this&#13;
advantage is more than compensated by the negative differences in the first&#13;
three subjects of study. Overall, INEM adjusted earnings are 1.7 lower than&#13;
control adjusted earnings.&#13;

Estimates of the social cost per student in each type of school and&#13;
for each subject are obtained from Hinchliffe (1983). These costs include&#13;
forgone earnings, capital costs of buildings, furniture and equipment and&#13;
direct recurrent costs. Foregone earnings were measured by the earnings of&#13;
primary school leavers and were taken from Psacharopoulos (1983), who used an&#13;
urban labor market survey for 1975. Monthly earnings of a primary school&#13;
leaver aged 22, at 1981 prices, were calculated to be 5,813 Pesos per month.&#13;
The per pupil capital cost, annualized, is based on the World Bank Appraisal&#13;
reports for the INEM and other secondary education projects in Colombia.&#13;
Recurrent expenditures financed by households are available from the student&#13;
questionnaire in some detail. Data on school expenditures including&#13;
salaries, maintenance, utilities, materials and equipment were based on the&#13;
school questionnaire and used to compare INEM and control schools as well as&#13;
subjects of study. Details about the assumptions made to arrive at these&#13;
figures can be found in Hinchliffe (1983). Table 29 shows direct costs per&#13;
student (that is, excluding foregone earnings) for the two types of school&#13;
and for five subjects of study. INEM education is more expensive for&#13;
Academic and Commercial studies, but cheaper for Industrial, Agricultural and&#13;
Social Services. Overall, weighting cost by the common sample attendance&#13;
distribution, INEM costs are 6.5 percent lower than Control costs.&#13;
To calculate rates of return over primary education, we used the&#13;
'short cut" rate of return method (Pacharopoulos, 1981). Essentially this&#13;
method assumes an infinite lifespan over which earnings are obtained, and a&#13;
comparison between two flat earnings profiles, which are used as&#13;

by the actual differential at age 22; that is, about 3 years after leaving&#13;
secondary education. Also, we assume that all the costs were incurred at&#13;
once during the year at which the evaluation is made (1978). A graphical&#13;
representation of these assumptions is given in Figure 6, and the formula for&#13;
the rate of return to which they lead is:&#13;
12 (Yij - Yp)&#13;
rij&#13;
6 (12 Yp + Cij)&#13;
where Yij is average gross monthly earnings of the i subject of study in the&#13;
j type of school, Yp is forgone monthly earnings and Cij is direct annual&#13;
cost per student of the i subject of study in the j type of school.&#13;
Table 30 shows the approximate social rates of return calculated&#13;
with this method. Overall, INEMs do not appear to be economically more&#13;
efficient than control schools. Their rate of return over primary education&#13;
is 9.5 percent as compared to 9.7 percent for control schools. These figures&#13;
are very close to each other and suggest that in social efficiency terms both&#13;
types of schools are virtually the same. The slightly lower earnings&#13;
attributable to INEMs are compensated by the slightly lower unit costs of&#13;
INEM education.&#13;

This similarity in overall rates hides substantial differences in&#13;
rates of return by subject of study. Resources spent on Industrial studies&#13;
are the ones that yield the highest return both in INEMs (12.0 percent) and&#13;
control schools (12.6 percent). Social Services on the other hand are among&#13;
the subjects with the lowest return (7.7 percent in INEMs and 5.5 percent in&#13;
control schools). INEM rates of return are in general lower than the&#13;
corresponding ones for control schools, particularly in Commercial and&#13;
Academic studies. However, a significant exception is that of Agriculture&#13;
were INEMs achieve a rate of return twice as large as that of control&#13;
schools. This advantage, together with a smaller one for Social Services,&#13;
makes the rate of return of INEMs for vocational subjects slightly higher&#13;
than that of control schools, but this is largely due to the very inefficient&#13;
outcome of Agricultural studies in control schools where the rate of return&#13;
is only 4.8 percent.&#13;
In addition to the qualifications pointed out previously about the&#13;
approximative nature of these rates of return, an important caveat concerning&#13;
the Academic rate of return should be noted. As we have seen in Section IV&#13;
above, the percentage of students going on to further studies is&#13;
significantly higher for INEMs than for control schools (for men 42.9 percent&#13;
as compared to 13.4 percent, and for women 15.2 percent as compared&#13;
to 4.6 percent). Thus, it is possible that the 8.4 percent rate for INEM&#13;
Academic in Table 30 is an underestimate of the true rate of return. Under&#13;
the assumption that students who enter higher education are on average more&#13;
able than those who enter the labour market after graduation, the higher&#13;
propensity of INEM students from the Academic track to continue their full&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
time studies must have biased downward the INEM Academic rate of return&#13;
relative to that of Control Academic students. So, a calculation on the&#13;
basis of earnings once all the cohort has been for some time in the labour&#13;
market, could result in a higher rate of return for INEM, and even reverse&#13;
the sign of the difference with control schools.&#13;

X. Summary and Conclusions&#13;
This paper has investigated to what extent the new modality of&#13;
INEM schools have had a differential effect on earnings and employment status&#13;
as compared with conventional secondary schools, and how these two types of&#13;
education compare in terms of economic efficiency. The main conclusions&#13;
reached can be summarized as follows:&#13;
(i) The simple examination of unstandardized data suggests that&#13;
earnings differences between INEM and traditional schools are not very&#13;
large. As far as men are concerned, the differences that are observed seem&#13;
to be due largely to the effect of self-employment, and concerning women,&#13;
graduates from traditional schools seem to do somewhat better than those from&#13;
INEMs.&#13;
(ii) The raw data on employment status suggest that INEMs have not&#13;
altered to any great extent the employment pattern of young people as&#13;
compared with the structure generated by the traditional school system. If&#13;
anything, the data suggest that INEMs, particularly in the case of males,&#13;
have accentuated the propensity of high school graduates for higher&#13;
education.&#13;
(iii) INEMs do not show a differential effect on the number of&#13;
people who end up enrolled in the best universities of the country, nor as&#13;
regards the number of graduates who end up unemployed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -&#13;
(iv) INEM students come from families which are poorer, and have&#13;
parents who are less educated, than those of control students, although the&#13;
differences are not very large. These background characteristics appear to&#13;
affect negatively the performance of INEM students during primary education,&#13;
but the data suggest that INEMs educationally outdo control schools in that&#13;
they manage to lower substantially the rate of secondary education repeaters.&#13;
(v) INEM Academic students take less pre-university courses than&#13;
their control counterparts. Given the remedial character of these courses&#13;
and the fact that Academic INEM graduates attend universities in a larger&#13;
proportion than Academic control graduates, this evidence reinforces our&#13;
previous conclusion about the higher educational quality of INEMs.&#13;
(vi) INEM graduates appear to undertake further training to a&#13;
greater extent than control graduates. This is mostly due to the fact that,&#13;
among those who choose further training, the duration of the courses is&#13;
longer for INEM than for control graduates. As for the proportion of&#13;
students that follow these courses, INEMs win over control schools but the&#13;
difference is small. Further training is fairly well matched with the&#13;
specialty of study and, in the subjects where the degree of matching is&#13;
highest (Commercial and Industrial), the difference between INEM and control&#13;
schools is again small.&#13;
(vii) When earnings are standardized for other factors such as&#13;
ability proxies and labor market experience, the conclusions of the&#13;
descriptive analysis are largely maintained. Overall, we have found that the&#13;
hypothesis that INEMs generate an earnings structure different from that&#13;
generated by traditional schools is not supported by the data.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -&#13;
(viii) This conclusion is true for both men and women, but we have&#13;
been able to identify some interesting differences between the two sexes.&#13;
While male earnings grow significantly with labor market experience, female&#13;
earnings show a practically flat profile. Tenure on the job, on the other&#13;
hand, seems to be a significant determinant of earnings for women but not for&#13;
men. Finally, as far as subject differences are concerned we have found that&#13;
male graduates who specialized in agricultural studies earn significantly&#13;
less than other male graduates, while female graduates who specialized in&#13;
commercial studies earn significantly more.&#13;
(ix) We have standardized employment status data by means of a&#13;
probit analysis which, in addition to school type and subject of study, has&#13;
also taken into account the influence of variables determining the relative&#13;
attractiveness of work versus study. Our overall conclusion is that as far&#13;
as women are concerned the main differences are not between INEM and control&#13;
schools, but between different subjects of study. Concerning men, on the&#13;
other hand, we have found statistically significant differences between INEM&#13;
and control schools.&#13;
(x) Male INEM graduates, in particular those from an academic&#13;
curriculum, are much more likely to end up studying full-time than their&#13;
counterparts from control schools. On the other hand, INEM graduates&#13;
following a commercial curriculum are much more likely to end up working&#13;
full-time than their traditional school counterparts. For the remaining&#13;
subjects, the probability of choosing the alternative "Working Only" is&#13;
higher, and that of choosing "Study Only" lower, for INEM graduates than for&#13;
control graduates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84 -&#13;
(xi) The pattern of probabilities for female graduates is similar&#13;
to that of men, but the differences between INEMs and traditional schools are&#13;
much smaller and statistically insignificant.&#13;
(xii) INEMs as a whole do not appear to be more efficient than&#13;
control schools. The rate of return of INEMs is approximately 9.5 percent as&#13;
compared to 9.7 percent for control schools. This similarily, however, hides&#13;
substantial differences in rates of return by subject of study. Resources&#13;
spent on Industrial studies yield the highest return both in INEM and control&#13;
schools. Social Services on the other hand are among the subjects with the&#13;
lowest returns. INEM rates are in general lower than the corresponding ones&#13;
for control schools, with the exception of Agriculture were INEMs achieve a&#13;
rate of return twice as large as that of control schools. INEMs appear more&#13;
efficient in providing vocational education (a 10.3 percent rate as compared&#13;
to a 9.7 percent rate for control schools). Also, due to the higher&#13;
propensity of Academic INEM students to go on to higher education, the rate&#13;
of return on INEM Academic studies could be substantially underestimated.&#13;
The differences in rates of return that have been evaluated are both small&#13;
and insignificant; this, together with the approximate nature of this&#13;
exercise, makes it impossible to discern any clear advantage of one type of&#13;
education over another.&#13;
Our overall conclusion is that INEMs have not increased the&#13;
propensity of high school graduates to enter the labor force. In fact, in&#13;
those cases in which a significant difference can be identified, we find that&#13;
the influence of INEMs has tended to go in the opposite direction. INEMs&#13;
have not influenced earnings either. But a final conclusion on this must&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -&#13;
wait to the availability of data from university graduates, since one of the&#13;
differential effects of INEMs has been to send people to universities to a&#13;
greater extent than traditional schools.&#13;

Annex 1   A sequential probability model&#13;
A general probability model to analyse the flows of high school&#13;
graduates in this set of data can be easily described with reference&#13;
to the patterns depicted in Figure A in the text.   Suppose that the&#13;
objective is to explain the probability with which an individual would&#13;
choose in 1981 each of the four available alternatives using information&#13;
on the individual's choice in 1978.&#13;
We denote the probability of being in status i in year t by Pitt&#13;
and the range of possibilities is given by four employment status&#13;
(i - 1,2,3,4), and two years (t - 0,1).   Thus P31 denotes the&#13;
probability of "Work Only" in 1981, while P10 denotes the probability&#13;
of "Study Only" in 1978.&#13;
We can think of the decision tree in the following manner.&#13;
Initially, in 1978, the individual faces four alternatives, with&#13;
probabilities&#13;
P 10       p 20        p 30    and     P40&#13;
Suppose the individual chooses alternative 1 in 1978, then his position&#13;
in 1981 can be thought of as the result of another election in which&#13;
the individual has to choose again among four alternatives, given&#13;
that he has already chosen to be initially in status 1.   The&#13;
probability that having chosen initially 1, he will now choose, say,&#13;
2 is the conditional probability (P21 IP10).   So this second stage&#13;
choice can be represented as follows:&#13;
pII I Plo)                 /(P11 I P20)&#13;
pp21  PlO)          p          21 I P20)&#13;
p10     (p310&#13;
P 31 IP10)                    (P31 IP20)&#13;
,iP 41 IP10)                  (P 41 IP20)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -&#13;
(P11 IP30)                         p11  P40)&#13;
(P21 IP30                         (p21  P40)&#13;
P0      (P31  P30)                        (P31 IP40)&#13;
(P41 IP30)                        (P41 IP40)&#13;
Then, the probability that an individual is found in, say, status 1 is&#13;
equal to the probability that he has chosen status 1 given that he&#13;
initially chose status 1, (P1l |P10)P10, plus the probability he has&#13;
chosen status 1 given that he initially chose status 2, .(P11 IP20)P20,&#13;
and so on.   Thus, the four probabilities of interest are&#13;
P11    (P11 P10)P10 + (P111P20)P20 + (P11 P30)P30 + (P111P40)P40     (1)&#13;
P21      (P21 IP10)P10 + (P211P20)P20 + (P211P30)P30 + (P211P4Q)P40   (2)&#13;
P 31   = (P31JP10)P10 + (P311P20)P20 + (P311P30)P30 + (P311 P40)P40   (3)&#13;
P 41  =  (P41jP10)P10 + (P411P20)P20 + (P411P30)P30 + (P411P40)P40    (4)&#13;
The model can be estimated consistently by fitting a multinomial&#13;
probit (with 4 alternatives) to all the 1978 data.     This would estimate&#13;
the four Pio (i = 1,...,4) probabilities.     Then the conditional elements&#13;
would be estimated by fitting again a multinomial probit, but this&#13;
time to each of the four subsamples resulting from the initial choice.&#13;
This would estimate the sixteen (PilP ) (i = 1,...,4; j = 1,...,4)&#13;
probabilities.    Then using expressions (1) to (4) the probabilities&#13;
wanted could be obtained.    This approach would both make the choices&#13;
as homogeneous as the data can permit, and utilize information on past&#13;
individual's decisions.    If, as expected, state dependency is important,&#13;
then the main diagonal in the matrix formed by (1) to (4) ought to&#13;
yield the largest probabilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -&#13;
Annex 2   The binomial probit model&#13;
The model of choice used in the text considers only two alterna-&#13;
tives (1 and 2).   It is therefore a binomial model of choice.&#13;
Suppose that we can represent the net benefits of alternative I by an&#13;
index X1 (X1 could be the present value of net earnings expected&#13;
from choosing alternative 1) which, in turn, can be presented as a&#13;
linear combination of variables plus an error term&#13;
X1 = !II + el&#13;
where a is a vector of parameters, Y1a vector of variables and s an&#13;
error term.&#13;
Assume also that the attractiveness of alternative 2 depends on&#13;
the index X2, which can also be represented as&#13;
X2 3     2 iY2 2&#13;
where B is another vector of parameters, Y2 another vector of variables,&#13;
which may include part or all of the variables in Yl, and   2 an error&#13;
term.&#13;
The model of choice-then is&#13;
If   X1aX    ,   individual chooses alternative 1&#13;
If   X1&lt; X2,     individual chooses alternative 2&#13;
Then, in general, the probability that an individual chooses alternative&#13;
, P1, is&#13;
P1 = Pr(X1 a X2)&#13;
Pr(aY1 + E 1 ¢ BY2 + E21&#13;
= Pr(E 2- E X      - $ 2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -&#13;
Define n = E2- E1 and   -Z    a     i__2  Then&#13;
P   =  Pr(n s Z))&#13;
Following the same procedure, we obtain&#13;
p2 =   Pr(n &gt; OZI                                (2)&#13;
which by construction must fulfill the constraint P2 = 1- P1.&#13;
If n is normally distributed then (1) and (2) constitute what&#13;
is known as the binomial probit model and can easily be estimated by&#13;
likelihood methods.   Suppose n is normally distributed with zero&#13;
mean and standard deviation a.   Then (1) and (2) can be standardized&#13;
as follows:&#13;
P1  = Pr[n/a S (0/a)ZI                           (3)&#13;
and  P2  = Pr[n/a &gt; (0/a)Z]                           (4)&#13;
which can be evaluated using the standardized normal distribution,&#13;
since n/a - N(0,1).&#13;
The likelihood function of the problem is the joint probability&#13;
of observing the sample, which using (3) and (4) can be expressed as&#13;
N        K&#13;
L  =   T pl    11   pj                            5&#13;
i=1     j=N+1&#13;
for a sample composed of N individuals who choose alternative 1, and&#13;
K-N individuals who choose alternative 2.   The model is estimated&#13;
by maximizing function (5) with respect to the set of parameters&#13;
(0/a).&#13;
Tables 9, 18 and 19 in the text give precisely this set of estimated&#13;
parameters for each of the 3 probits considered. Notice that these&#13;
parameters determine the cut-off level of the distribution- as shown&#13;
by expressions (3) or (4)- and can therefore be used to evaluate&#13;
probabilities, which is what is done in Tables 10 and 20.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -&#13;
Call this cut-off level M.    Then, for a given individual i,&#13;
M.        a)zi                                     (6)&#13;
and the probability that this individual chooses 1, Pii, is given by&#13;
the area to the left of M. in the standardized normal.&#13;
Take for instance the model investigating the probability of&#13;
"Working Only" estimated in the text.    For the typical individual&#13;
described in the text who in addition followed an academic curriculum&#13;
in an INEM, the cut-off value, which we denote by MI, is&#13;
M, =       )ZI=       1.524&#13;
Then we read from the table of the standardized normal the area to the&#13;
left of -1.524 and this gives 0.064, a 6.4 percent probability that&#13;
this individual will choose the option "Work Only".    In Figure A.1&#13;
we represent this area in panel A.    If we now evaluate the cut-off&#13;
point for an identical person except that has followed an academic&#13;
curriculum in a control school, Mc , we obtain&#13;
M   =           =   - .321&#13;
c       -   -&#13;
and the corresponding area to the left of Mc is 0.375, a 37.5 percent&#13;
probability that this person will choose the option "Work Only".     In&#13;
this manner, by varying the elements of the set of variables Z, and&#13;
the corresponding coefficients, the whole array of entries in Table&#13;
14 can be derived.&#13;

            The destination and early career
            performance of secondary school graduates in Colombia :
            findings from the 1978 cohort
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper reports the results of an
            evaluation of Bank-assisted diversified secondary schools
            (INEM) in Colombia offering prevocational subjects alongside
            the traditional academic curriculum. The evaluation is based
            on a retrospective follow-up of nearly 1,800 graduates of
            target and control schools three years after leaving school.
            The central finding is that the new schools have not
            generated further training or employment patterns that are
            different from the control schools. In particular, INEM
            graduates are not more likely to enter employment
            immediately upon graduation and do not obtain higher
            earnings in the labor market than traditional graduates.
            According to this inital evaluation, there is virtually no
            difference in the social rate of return on the resources
            invested in the two types of schools.
