        <abstracts>
            More than twenty countries are now
            reforming their power sectors. For many politicians, this
            reform means simply restructuring and privatizing
            state-owned enterprises. But, what they forget or may not
            know is that a government cannot regulate private power
            companies the way it once regulated state enterprises. The
            author argues that if a government is serious about
            attracting private investors, it has no choice but to adopt
            a new regulatory system that keeps promises and exercises
            restraint-one that is independent and open to public scrutiny.
