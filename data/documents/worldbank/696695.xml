URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE AND PILOT DECENTRALIZATION PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:           Islamnic Republic of Mauritania&#13;
Supervisory Ministry Ministry of Interior, Directorate of Local Governments&#13;
(Direction des Collectivites Locales--DCL)&#13;
Executing Agency:    AMEXTIPE (Mauritanian Executing Agencyfor Public Works and&#13;
Employment/Agence Mauritanienne d 'Execution de Travaux Publics&#13;
pour I 'Emploi)&#13;
Credit Amount:      SDR9.7 million (US$14 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms:              Standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity&#13;
Cofinancing:        The Government and the Municipalities will finance an amount estimated&#13;
at US$6.4 million. Germany, Canada and France have expressed interest&#13;
in continuing with parallel financing.&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
and Description:    The operation would have: (a) four development obiectives: (i) reduce&#13;
poverty by improving access to basic urban services; (ii) develop the local&#13;
private sector by increasing the competitiveness of construction and&#13;
consulting firns; (iii) support an initial pilot phase of decentralization so&#13;
that local governments can better plan and manage urban infrastructure&#13;
assets and services, and improve resource mobilization; and (iv) improve&#13;
public sector management by using transparent procedures and delegation&#13;
of project authority; and (b) three project objectives: (i) create new&#13;
temporary employment opportunities in rapidly growing urban and peni-&#13;
urban areas; (ii) help municipalities create or rehabilitate basic, urgent&#13;
infrastructure assets; and (iii) develop municipal capacity to manage these&#13;
assets and help MOI to play its tutorship role.&#13;
The project will have two components: (a) a program of poverty-&#13;
oriented, labor-intensive works sub-projects (US$20.5 million) in&#13;
participating cities, consisting of rehabilitation or construction of urban&#13;
facilities of various categories; and (b) capacity building (pilot&#13;
decentralization): (i) at the municipal level (US$2 million), to enhance&#13;
managerial capacities through the introduction of municipal management&#13;
tools including provision of equipment and training; and (ii) at the national&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
iv                           Mauritania. Urban Infrastructure and Pilot Decentralization Project. SAR.&#13;
level (US$1.5 million), to strengthen the monitoring capacity of the MOI&#13;
and to prepare new municipal regulations.&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
and Risks:           The program of labor-intensive public works (US$20.5 million) consists&#13;
of four categories of sub-projects: (i) economic sub-projects&#13;
(approximately US$6 million) which would have an economic rate of&#13;
return (ERR) of at least 12 percent and the net present value (NPV) is&#13;
expected to reach a minimum of US$1.2 million; average actual ERRs,&#13;
under the ongoing CCEP, have been 31 percent for roads, 42 percent for&#13;
protection against sand encroachment, 25 percent for drainage works, 17&#13;
percent for public buildings; (ii) social sub-projects (approximately US$8&#13;
million) for which ERR would not be calculated for each operation but&#13;
which would meet sectoral priority criteria for sectoral projects that have&#13;
an average ERR above 10 percent; (iii) revenue eaming projects&#13;
(approximately US$4 million), which would have a minimum financial&#13;
rate of return of 15 percent and an estimated NPV of US$0.8 million,&#13;
actual average financial rate of retum under CCEP was 33, and (iv)&#13;
municipal management sub-projects (approximately US$2 million) which&#13;
would bring additional fiscal revenue over the next three years of 200&#13;
percent of the investment costs and have an estimated cumulated NPV of&#13;
US$3.8 million. These amounts do not include other tangible and&#13;
important, but unmeasured benefits such as: (a) savings in travel time to&#13;
jobs, schools and health facilities; (b) training of unskilled labor; (c)&#13;
building the capacity of local consulting and construction enterprises; and&#13;
(d) improving operational efficiency of municipal govemments. The latter&#13;
would be monitored through the Municipal Contracts, annual performance&#13;
audits and municipal performance indicators. Over the longer term, the&#13;
institutional and policy reformns supported by the project are expected to&#13;
expand the decentralization program beyond the pilot phase by building&#13;
municipal management capacity and mobilizing local resources.&#13;
This is not a high-risk project. There are four minor risks intemal to the&#13;
proposed operation. First, on the resource mobilization side,&#13;
municipalities could fail to increase their revenue base and tax collection.&#13;
To mitigate this risk, a gradual approach to local resource mobilization&#13;
and a study on national/local revenue sharing will be implemented.&#13;
Second, on the counterpart funds side, the Govemment and participating&#13;
municipalities may not provide their contributions. To avoid this risk, the&#13;
project provides for up-front contributions before the signing of all civil&#13;
works contracts. Evidence from the ongoing CCEP indicates that strong&#13;
endorsement from municipalities will continue. Third, the program may&#13;
further skew regional inequities. To mitigate this risk, the eligibility&#13;
criteria for regional balance will be included and refined in the Regional&#13;
Development Fund. And fourth, on the institutional side, the DCL may&#13;
not play its expanded monitoring and mentoring role. To mitigate this&#13;
risk, additional institution support would be provided by bilateral&#13;
agencies, notably France and Germany. Exogenous risks include a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Mauritania. Urban Infrastructure and PilotDecentralization Project. SAR.              v&#13;
slowdown of the economy resulting in tighter fiscal controls or&#13;
backtracking on further decentralization. The impact of these two risks&#13;
was assessed and the conclusion was reached that it is very unlikely that&#13;
Government will backslide on economic management or on the&#13;
institutional and political gains already achieved in municipal elections&#13;
and decentralization.&#13;
Poverty:              Reducing poverty and unemployment are among Mauritania's and IDA's&#13;
priority goals. The 1994 poverty profile surveys conducted in Mauritania&#13;
stress that 57 percent of the population lives below the poverty threshold&#13;
(UM 32,000 or US$370 per capita per year) and that the poor have&#13;
limited access to basic services infrastructure (safe water, sanitation,&#13;
schools, health centers). The project, therefore, aims at improving access&#13;
of the poor to these basic services. The use of new management tools&#13;
(priority investment programs, performance indicators, eligibility criteria)&#13;
will help municipalities better identify the right priorities and target poor&#13;
areas by providing improved access to basic infrastructure and services,&#13;
such as safe water, sanitation, drainage, schools and clinics. Other&#13;
expected benefits are: a direct impact by creating about 45,000 man-&#13;
months of temporary employment and an indirect impact by creating&#13;
permanent jobs due to the shift from capital intensive to labor intensive&#13;
construction methods. Due to the simplicity of most works, 60 percent of&#13;
wages is likely to go to unskilled workers.&#13;

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF MAURITANIA&#13;
MINISTRY OF INTERIOR, POSTS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS&#13;
DIRECTORATE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS&#13;
COMMUNICATION TO COUNCIL OF MINISTERS&#13;
SUBJECT: MUNICIPAL POLICY STATEIENT&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
When restructuring began in 1984, the President of the Republic pledged to establish&#13;
democratic institutions in Mauritania.&#13;
This commitment was supported by all strata of the population. Accordingly, in 1986,&#13;
local government elections were organized at the regional level, and subsequently, in 1987 and&#13;
1988, at the departmental level and in the rural municipalities.&#13;
The intention behind this measure was, on the one hand, to provide all population&#13;
groups with experience of the democratic process through their exercise of the right to vote&#13;
and organization of electoral campaigns, and, on the other, to give substance to the democratic&#13;
option by demonstrating its importance as an element in the country's general development.&#13;
While this was the intention of the country's highest authorities, local structures and&#13;
local elected officials were not prepared technically for this transfer of power or its anticipated&#13;
contribution to sound local governance.&#13;
Difficulties of a physical, institutional, professional, and financial nature clearly have&#13;
to be overcome if the municipal councils are to function normally and regularly from the&#13;
outset.&#13;
Other constraints are ascribable mainly to the general environment. For instance, the&#13;
Directorate of Local Governments (DCL) and the administrative authorities, whose appointed&#13;
mission is to advise, monitor, and regulate, are not themselves sufficiently well equipped to&#13;
carry out these tasks. The situation is further complicated by a series of other problems, all of&#13;
which need not be enumerated here but which include the following examples:&#13;
*  The supervisory authority (DCL) lacking the physical, legal, technical, and human&#13;
resources to exercise effective supervision and to provide guidance and coordination;&#13;
*  Difficulties in putting laws and regulations into effect, a result of insufficient training&#13;
among elected officials in a sphere of activity new to them;&#13;
*  Municipalities without resident mayors and municipal councils who do not meet;&#13;
*  Conflicts of all types between administrative authorities and mayors;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
Mauriania. Urban Infrastructure and Pilot Decentralization Project. StaffAppraisal Report.&#13;
Aimexe 2&#13;
Page 2 / 20&#13;
*  Municipal overstaffing, out of keeping with the possibilities and needs of the&#13;
municipalities;&#13;
*  Excessive debt obligations, and accumulated payroll arrears;&#13;
*  Lack of concrete achievements and services of value to local communities;&#13;
*  Absence of political, economic, social, and financial framework formulated for municipal&#13;
development;&#13;
*  Commitments not tailored to available financing;&#13;
*  A taxation system failing to accommodate the differences among municipalities;&#13;
*  Shortcomings in collection procedures.&#13;
In these circumstances, solutions are needed that will allow the municipal institution to&#13;
be protected and developed - an institution that is of primordial political importance among the&#13;
country's constitutional institutions in the election of the Senate and in the nomination, on the&#13;
basis of 50 signatures of municipal councilors, of candidates for the office of Head of State.&#13;
It is thus imperative to make every effort to orient action by the municipalities toward&#13;
integrated local development that will allow all dimensions of the problems facing them to be&#13;
addressed.&#13;
This is equivalent to saying that each recovery action must inevitably involve:&#13;
&#149;  rehabilitation of local government finances;&#13;
*  rational use and redeployment of the municipal work force;&#13;
D introduction of simple financial legislation;&#13;
-  commitment by the administrative authorities to better supervision of the municipalities;&#13;
-  improved management;&#13;
*  training for elected officials;&#13;
-  reorganization and reinforcement of the supervisory authority.&#13;
The objective of the municipal policy statement set out in the attached document&#13;
submitted for your approval is to generate solutions to the problems outlined above, which&#13;
hinder the advance of our municipalities.&#13;
This municipal policy statement is one of the components of a four-year urban&#13;
infrastructure development program covering the period 1996-1999, for which the World Bank&#13;
is to provide funding.&#13;

MUNICIPAL POLICY STATEMENT&#13;
The Government of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania began democratization through&#13;
administrative decentralization in 1986 with a view to promoting the exercise of democracy and&#13;
fostering local government through participatory methods conducive to good governance.&#13;
The Government is convinced that, in the current context, development goes hand in&#13;
hand with decentralized administration, especially given the advent of democracy in 1991. The&#13;
democracy and decentralization accomplished thus far have heightened the confidence of local&#13;
stakeholders and international donors, which will increase the chances of successful nationwide&#13;
decentralization.&#13;
The determination of the Government to introduce decentralization and make it a&#13;
permanent feature is behind the formulation of this municipal development policy statement,&#13;
which must in practice result in a transfer of functions to the municipal governments and an&#13;
improvement in their institutional and organizational environment. This policy statement also&#13;
aims at fostering the conditions that will enable the municipalities to increase their financial&#13;
capabilities and implement investment programs centered on the construction, rehabilitation&#13;
and upkeep of urban infrastructure.&#13;
Meeting future challenges in the realm of infrastructure' is not merely an exercise of&#13;
simple accounting - that is, preparing an inventory of existing infrastructure and calculating&#13;
necessary investment on the basis of past trends. Instead, all inefficiencies in both investment&#13;
and the supply of services must be tackled and user demands more efficiently addressed.&#13;
Efforts to increase infrastructure must be accompanied by an improvement in services.&#13;
It is in that spirit that the proposals contained in this document seek to ensure the necessary&#13;
legal and financial conditions. These will involve:&#13;
I.    Municipal assets:&#13;
* infrastructure management'&#13;
*  authority to contract&#13;
*  introduction of performance criteria for access to investment.&#13;
II.    Resource mobilization:&#13;
*  taxation&#13;
*  financing of local development&#13;
*  operation of institutions&#13;
*  municipal action.&#13;
I.    MUNICIPAL ASSETS&#13;
(a)   Infrastructure Management&#13;
l The term infrastructure in this context refers to the whole range of fixed assets (roads, municipal&#13;
facilities, property) envisaged by Article 2 of Ordonnance 289.87.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
Mauriania Urban infrastructure and Pilot Decentralization Project. StaffAppraisal Report.&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 4 / 20&#13;
Transfer of municipal assets to the local governments, as defined in Article 2 of&#13;
Ordonnance 87.289 of October 20, 1987 establishing the municipalities (communes), has in&#13;
many cases not taken place.&#13;
The Government will therefore do its utmost to promote implementation of the&#13;
provisions already been set forth in the basic legislation governing the decentralization of the&#13;
country.&#13;
That implementation could consist of action to:&#13;
-     Amend existing legislation by taking into account the particular nature of the type of&#13;
municipality. In this connection, a study could be undertaken to propose solutions geared to&#13;
specifically local circumstances;&#13;
-     Establish agreements between urban municipalities and supervisory authorities for&#13;
transfer of goods and services that by their nature are of local interest. In this connection,&#13;
clear measures governing municipal assets should be introduced as soon as possible so that&#13;
local governments are aware of exactly what means are at their disposal and the possibilities&#13;
for sound management of their resources;&#13;
-     Disseminate informational and educational texts, circulars and documents so that local&#13;
elected officials understand their areas of jurisdiction with a view to better management of&#13;
municipal assets and judicious utilization of the legal means at their disposal;&#13;
-     Hold training seminars and workshops on case studies, and encourage exchanges of&#13;
experience among elected officials.&#13;
(b)   Authority to Contract&#13;
In practical terms, real decentralization entails the authority to contract - in other&#13;
words, the legal and financial capacity to commit public funds.&#13;
This is in itself an area of expertise that is new to many elected municipal officials who&#13;
are inexperienced with it, especially because in the past local infrastructure loans have been&#13;
small, or non-existent. As the municipalities play the dual role of contracting authority and&#13;
operator, through the design of urban works and services and their execution on force account,&#13;
municipal teams have very divergent levels of familiarity with the specifics of project&#13;
management.&#13;
First of all, the decisionmaking role of municipalities in project management should be&#13;
reaffirmed, provided that the necessary funding is available, even if authority to contract, in&#13;
terms of technical tasks, can be largely delegated.&#13;
(c)   Introduction of Performance Criteria for Access to Investment&#13;
This new approach aims at rationalizing municipal action and management, given&#13;
present limited means and vast needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 5 / 20&#13;
In this respect, the Government plans to give priority to inter-municipal infrastructure&#13;
projects with joint commune-based funding of capital costs.&#13;
Ways will also be sought of encouraging associations of municipalities in a given&#13;
region, for example to build socioeconomic infrastructure jointly for their common good.&#13;
Since the Government is aware that infrastructure performance depends on the&#13;
institutional environment, as well as on the general conditions for growth and economic&#13;
development, it also plans to take additional measures to consolidate municipal resources.&#13;
IL.    RESOURCE MOBILIZATION&#13;
Implementation of this policy requires reforms in taxation and municipal organization:&#13;
D taxation&#13;
&#149; financing of local development&#13;
&#149;  operation of institutions&#13;
D  municipal action.&#13;
(a)    Taxation&#13;
Local taxation is inadequate and ad hoc, in terms of both the tax base and collection&#13;
system. The new policy will therefore seek to streamline the tax system overall and adapt it to&#13;
actual circumstances, with a view to maximizing revenue. The reforms should target both the&#13;
tax base and collection procedures.&#13;
Tax basg&#13;
Taxes and fees should be streamlined and collection performance improved.&#13;
Additionally, municipal taxes should be standardized.&#13;
Tax collection&#13;
Given its present poor performance record, revision of the municipal collection system&#13;
is critical. Regulations must be simplified, functions reshuffled, the exact fields of action of&#13;
the national and municipal tax authorities redefined, and incentives to optimize tax receipts&#13;
introduced.&#13;
Under the revised, simplified and standardized tax system, the central govermnent and&#13;
its decentralized offices should be responsible for the collection of all national and municipal&#13;
taxes, and the municipalities released from all tax collection functions.&#13;
This administrative specialization would have the advantage of increasing the coherence&#13;
of the tax system, improving the mobilization of management tools, encouraging better review&#13;
of disputes, and facilitating depersonalization of relations between tax officials and taxpayers.&#13;
It is also recommended that financial incentives be offered collection agents, and that other&#13;
incentives be offered to taxpayers to encourage them to meet their tax obligations by&#13;
themselves. For example, it might be made obligatory to show evidence of tax payment in&#13;
&#13;

order to effect certain administrative transactions such as the sale of fixed assets, lease&#13;
agreements, and so on.&#13;
(b)    Local Development Fnancing&#13;
Ena&#13;
Municipal self-financing capabilities need to be strengthened.&#13;
To that end, the focus should be on certain actions, primarily productive commercial&#13;
activities, although without prejudice to vital investments in social and educational&#13;
infrastructure.&#13;
Cooeration&#13;
With regard to the mobilization of international resources, the bases for aid&#13;
coordination must be laid.&#13;
To that end, access to bilateral and multilateral aid should be enhanced. This can be&#13;
achieved if the Ministry of Planning and the Decentralized Cooperation Office of the Ministry&#13;
of the Interior provide information on progress with projects under way and on sector studies&#13;
that have been carried out or are in preparation.&#13;
Remote communities without access to "stand-alone" cooperation assistance, owing to&#13;
their limited ability to identify and negotiate such aid, should receive special support.&#13;
(c)    Operation of Institutions&#13;
Local accounting systems suffer from overly complicated and unnecessary procedures&#13;
and are not sufficiently transparent.&#13;
Excessively formal, current municipal accounting systems involve too much red tape&#13;
and are not tailored to the reality of most municipalities. Consequently, they do not allow for&#13;
optimal expenditure structures and, more generally, impede management of the municipal&#13;
entity. Budget and administration simplification is therefore needed, especially for the rural&#13;
municipalities.&#13;
Personnel&#13;
Issues of employment and status of municipal personnel must be discussed as part of&#13;
the larger picture of municipal functions and capabilities, especially since the 'auxiliary&#13;
employees' category has been eliminated by the new  civil service legislation.   The&#13;
organization chart should be adapted to the activity and means of the municipality.&#13;

Monitoring&#13;
Ex post checks and controls on municipal public expenditure should be strengthened so&#13;
that budgetary accountability can be established where necessary and persons who&#13;
misappropriate funds can be penalized. Ex ante checks and controls should be limited as far as&#13;
possible to matters of form (compliance with rules).&#13;
(d)   Mzuucpal Action&#13;
Since municipal action is the very lifeblood of decentralization, it needs to be the focus&#13;
of strategic planning that incorporates central government policy on the various aspects of the&#13;
economy and on regional development. The linking of national and municipal programs&#13;
should be institutionalized and planned at both the regional and national levels.&#13;
The Economic SDhere&#13;
A sector policy is needed which is consistent with the Government's economic policies.&#13;
Sectors with a direct impact on daily life should be revitalized - in particular&#13;
telecommunications, urban development, housing, tourism, and employment. Ibis will require&#13;
the formulation of program plans and the launching of projects that create employment&#13;
opportunities.&#13;
Data Processing and Storage&#13;
These policies will be dependent for success on the generation and processing of&#13;
municipal data leading to creation of a data base that facilitates analysis of the economic impact&#13;
of proposed municipal actions.&#13;
As the vehicle that will allow the components of its municipal policy to be brought to&#13;
fruition, the ambitious municipal development program envisaged by the Government will&#13;
require major financial and technical resources.&#13;
This sector policy statement is one of the current necessary steps toward formulation&#13;
and execution of a clear and committed national policy, as well as toward mobilization of the&#13;
financial and technical resources available in a context of international cooperation in&#13;
consultation with our development partners.&#13;
Thus, approval of this statement will signal the Government's political will to strive&#13;
with greater determination for municipal development, decentralization as an accomplished&#13;
fact, and democracy as a pervasive element in national life.&#13;

Note d'Orientation&#13;
Questions I etudier pour la prochaine etape de la decentralisation en Mauritanie&#13;
1. Objectifs&#13;
Accrottre l'efficacite des services aux populations locales en donnant I celles-ci un role dans la&#13;
prise des decisions qui les concernent et en creant un cadre incitatif pour les communes et le&#13;
gouvernement central par:&#13;
* l'acces aux ressources en fonction des responsabilites&#13;
* une rdpartition adequate des competences entre les communes et de l'Etat afin&#13;
d'encourager une prestation efficace des services qui reponde aux preferences de la&#13;
population locale, en ce qui concerne les services a benefices localises (tels que la&#13;
collecte des ordures), et qui soit coherente avec la politique nationale en ce qui&#13;
concerne les services I benefices nationaux (tel que l'education primaire)&#13;
I. Ressponsabilites des Conununes&#13;
Dresser une liste des differentes categories de communes pour etablir une liste realiste des&#13;
competences qu'elles peuvent assumer&#13;
Distinguer, dans la liste des competences devolues aux communes, celles qui apportent des&#13;
benefices au niveau national et meritent, en principe, un support du gouvernement central, afin&#13;
de garantir une qualite de service de base de celles dont les benefices sont locaux et qui&#13;
devraient etre financees, en principe, par les ressources mobilisees au niveau local (taxes ou&#13;
cotts d'usagers),  et pour un certain niveau de service repondant aux preferences de la&#13;
commune&#13;
Identifier pour chaque fonction le principal responsable de facto de la fourniture du service&#13;
(actuellement c'est rarement la commune) et preciser ses relations avec la commune&#13;
Exemple: La Sonelec- evolution possible vers des contrats de concession ou d'affermage avec&#13;
les communes. Revision de la tutelle et du contrat plan ?&#13;
Revoir les relations entre les communes et les ministeres centraux  (Education et Sante,&#13;
Equipements, Agriculture, etc)&#13;
*  en matiere de decisions concernant les communes (investissements et autres) ou la&#13;
gestion des services dont les communes sont responsables, afin d'aboutir I une&#13;
definition appropriee du rOle des communes;&#13;
*  dans la repartition des competences entre la commune et le ministere de tutelle afin&#13;
d'encourager l'efficacite dans la prestation des services par les communes , ceci&#13;
impose d'edaircir les responsabilites en matiere d'entretien&#13;
&#13;

*  pour assurer des capacites techniques de gestion des services locaux coherentes avec&#13;
les responsabilitds devolues, sans toutefois gonfler le nombre des employes locaux ni&#13;
les charges fixes a la charge des communes&#13;
* en vue d'inciter le secteur prive I participer au financement et I la gestion des services&#13;
locaux&#13;
m.   Transferts financiers de l'Etat aux Communes&#13;
Etudier les systemes de redistribution des revenus du gouvernement central aux communes:&#13;
* fonds d'investissement, y inclus l'assistance des bailleurs de fonds, en vue des objectifs&#13;
suivants:&#13;
- encourager l'allocation rationnelle des investissements basee sur la demande et la&#13;
volonte de payer de beneficiaires locaux et une gestion de services plus efficace,&#13;
specialement en matiere d'entretien;&#13;
- assurer les services de base et d'importance nationale sur tout dans le territoire;&#13;
lorsque la commune rend des services d'interet national, etablir les procedures&#13;
d'allocation de fonds aux communes pour garantir ces services et fixer des conditions&#13;
d'acces k ces fonds, y compris des criteres de performance: efficacite, entretien etc.&#13;
* autres transferts : Identifier les formules qui les guideraient (de preference limites&#13;
puisque les services de base pour les populations pauvres seraient deja finances par les&#13;
modalites citees ci-dessus)aux municipalites si des soucis d'equite regionale le justifient&#13;
Dans les deux cas identifies ci-dessus, 61aborer les regles de financement des investissements&#13;
IV.   Revenus&#13;
Taxes et bpOts au niveau central et communal&#13;
Identifier les possibilites de rationaliser les doubles taxes (ex. taxes foncieres centrales et&#13;
municipales, taxe de debarquement des marchandises dans le port de Nouakchott, taxe sur le&#13;
poisson d6barqu6 I Nouadhibou), classer, dans la mesure du possible, les taxes en deux&#13;
cat6gories: celles a effet disperse au niveau national,(impot sur le revenu, TVA, taxes&#13;
douanibres, sur la pkche) et celles a effet local (taxe foncire , patente, taxes sur les marches)&#13;
et les allouer I un seul niveau d'autorit6 (communal ou central) pour 6viter la competition entre&#13;
differents niveaux d'autorites sur les memes assiettes de taxation.&#13;
Taxes communales&#13;
Chercher I rendre leur administration plus efficace-delegation au gouvernement central, ou&#13;
autres moyennant paiement pour services rendus (ceci etant ou non laisse au choix des&#13;
communes?)&#13;
Permettre plus de souplesse aux communes dans le choix de taux-(par Elimination graduelle de&#13;
la fourchette?)&#13;

locales) dans la gestion financiere et la prise de d6cisions concernant l'allocation des ressources&#13;
Etablir des regles d'allocation des fonds (externes et nationaux) basees sur la performance des&#13;
communes, en ce qui les concerne&#13;
VI.   Incitations pour les Administrations du gouvernemnent central&#13;
Etablir des indicateurs de performance des services I benefices localises (fournis par les&#13;
ministeres ou les entreprises publiques) afin de comparer l'efficacite des agences centrales I&#13;
celle des communes ou de leurs services concedes (etant donne que la capacite des communes&#13;
devrait evoluer dans l'avenir)&#13;

Projet de Termes de reference pour la prochaine etape de la decentralisation en Mauritanie:&#13;
Processus paraUele de reforme fiscale, l6gale et r6glementaire en matiere de decentralisation.&#13;
1.    Anime par la volonte de democratiser et de promouvoir le developpement au niveau local,&#13;
le gouvemrnement Mauritanien a entamd en 1986 un programme de decentralisation. De nombreux&#13;
progres ont r6alis6s sur les plans legislatif et fiscal. Ainsi les communes, instituees par une&#13;
ordonnance de 1987, sont dotees de la personnalite morale et jouissent d'une certaine autonomie&#13;
financiere. Elles sont placees sous l'autorite d'un naire elu par le conseil municipal (lui-m&amp;ne issu&#13;
du suffrage universel). La majorite des services urbains (voirie locale, alimentation en eau,&#13;
transports urbains.. .cf. tableau 1) releve desormais de leurs competences aussi bien pour la&#13;
construction que pour la gestion et l'entretien. 11 faut toutefois noter que la politique fonciere et la&#13;
police restent du ressort du Ministere de l'Intnrieur, des Postes et des T6lecommunications (MIPT),&#13;
chargd par ailleurs de la tutelle des communes. En matiere fiscale, la reforme de 1990 constitue une&#13;
premiere avancee. Elle a penmis de clarifier les taxes locales susceptibles d'ere percues par les&#13;
communes et de simplifier les imp6ts d'etat qui leur sont devolus.&#13;
2.    Lors des Journ6es sous la Khayma en juillet 1995, le gouvernement a confirmn  son desir&#13;
d'utiliser la d6centralisation et la rdfome institutionnelle qui en decoule au niveau du&#13;
gouvemement central et a celui des collectivites locales comme instrument majeur de&#13;
duveloppement du pays. La prochaine 6tape de ce processus est "la mise en place de methodes&#13;
participatives en faveur d'une bonne gestion des affaires des populations" (Declaration de politique&#13;
municipale du 14 juin 1995). L'objectif gouvememental est donc d6sormais d'accro^itre l'efficacite&#13;
des services publics rendus aux populations en donnant a ces derieres un role dans la prise des&#13;
d6cisions qui les concement, tout en garantissant le respect des strategies nationales 6tablies. Cette&#13;
volonte est soutenue par les demandes formulees par les maires des Communes de Maurtanie lors&#13;
de leur congres annuel (avril 1995): a) definition d'une typologie des communes, b) modemisation&#13;
de la fiscalite communale urbaine comme rurale, c) amelioration du Fonds Regional de&#13;
D6veloppement, d) transparence accrue, e) mise en oeuvre d'un programme de formation pour le&#13;
personnel communal et les 6lus, et f) restructuration de la Direction des Collectivites Locales&#13;
(DCL) au scin du MIPT. Cette volont6 politique partag6e de mener a bien la d6centralisation a&#13;
permis de cerner les questions qu'il faut maintenant aborder.&#13;
3.    Les problbnes actuels tiennent a la complexite du systeme fiscal, a l'absence de&#13;
clarification des roles respectifs des communes et des ministeres de tutelle, au manque de moyens&#13;
et de competence de nombreuses communes, et a la faible participation de la population. L'enjeu&#13;
majeur de cette etude est de definir les prochaines etapes du processus de decentralisation et&#13;
d'apporter un appui aux communes durant le transfert de responsabilites. L'etude se concentrera&#13;
sur deux elements intimement lies, qui sont les ressources fiscales et les responsabilites des&#13;
collectivites locales. Sans un systeme fiscal transparent, mcitant a de bonnes performances dans la&#13;
prestation de services locaux, et allouant des fonds adequats aux responsables de ces prestations, le&#13;
progres qui peut etre r6alis6 par la d6centralisation est tres limite. Un critere fondamental de&#13;
r6ussite sera l'elaboration de procedures permetant une veritable amelioration des services&#13;
communaux, particulierement pour les pauvres. Enfin, on veillera a garder a l'esprit les&#13;
particularit6s de la Mauritanie : a) une population (2,300,000 habitants) regroupee pour 30% a&#13;
Nouakchott (700,000 habitants) et, b) un d6s6quilibre interregional important des ressources des&#13;
&#13;

collectivites locales qui s'explique en partie par des activites economiques distinctes, mais aussi&#13;
par certaines mesures fiscales reconnues comme des expedients temporaires qu'il faudra revoir&#13;
dans le contexte de la decentralisation.&#13;
Objectifs de 1'6tude&#13;
4.     L'amelioration des services rendus aux usagers, souhaitee par le gouvernement et les elus&#13;
locaux, n6cessite I'amelioration des infrastructures urbaines, ainsi que celle des services&#13;
communaux. Pour &amp;re efficace, le transfert des competences aux municipalites doit s'accompagner&#13;
de mesures d'incitation pour les communes comme pour le gouvemement central. Seront ainsi&#13;
envisages:&#13;
a) la clarification des responsabilites des communes non seulement de jure mais aussi de&#13;
facto;&#13;
b) I'allocation de ressources en rapport avec 1'etendue des responsabilites;&#13;
c) une repartition adequate des competences entre les communes et l'Etat afin, d'une part,&#13;
de delivrer des services locaux (par ex. Ia collecte de ordures) qui repondent aux besoins et&#13;
pr6ferences des administr6s et, d'autre part, de preserver la coherence des politiques sectorielles&#13;
nationales (par ex. dans le domaine de l'education prinaire).&#13;
5.     Face a ces questions, le gouvemement Mauritanien a demande a la Banque Mondiale de&#13;
continuer a l'assister dans la mise en oeuvre de sa politique de decentralisation. Le processus que&#13;
la Banque propose d'appuyer consiste a engager des experts ayant a) 1'experience des systemes&#13;
fiscaux, institutionnels, legaux et reglementaires en vigueur dans d'autres pays decentralises et b),&#13;
une bonne compr6hension du contexte mauritanien. Ces experts etudieront la reglementation et les&#13;
pratiques actuelies en Mauritanie et proposeront des reformes pour la prochaine etape de la&#13;
d alisaton. Ils souligneront les mesures a prendre et les resultats que l'on peut en attendre.&#13;
Les propositions de r6forme devraient etre accompagnees de scenarios de financement des services&#13;
et des repercussions fiscales pour le gouverenent central, comme pour les collectivites locales.&#13;
Les hypotheses sur la qualite et la couverture geographique des services qui sous-tendent ces&#13;
scenarios de financmnt devront etre specifi6es. Le but de l'etude n'est pas seulement de cldfinir,&#13;
dans un rapport final une liste de reformes a entreprendre. Elle consiste aussi a proposer au&#13;
gouvernement mauritanien des scenarios de reforme possibles; et a l'infomier des implications&#13;
6ventuelles des decisions a prendre en consultation avec les principaux interess6s. Ainsi une&#13;
collaboration etroite entre les experts et les comites form6s par le gouvemement pour etudier les&#13;
r6formes (le comite interministeriel de la decentralisation et le comite technique d'appui et de&#13;
coordination) est essentielle au succes du travail. Les etapes principales du processus envisag6 sont&#13;
d.crites en tableau 2.&#13;
6.     Cette etude necessite des experts dans les deux domaines principaux: relations&#13;
intergouvernementales (fiscales et institutionnelles) et institutions et fiscalite locales, r6unis en une&#13;
equipe unique. Une experience reussie au niveau intemational et la connaissance du contexte&#13;
mauritanien sont des crit&amp;res essentiels de qualification.&#13;
I- Responsabilites des communes&#13;
7.     On note de grandes disparites entre les 208 communes. Les differences entre les&#13;
collectivit6s locales (qualification du personnel, montant des revenus locaux) aussi bien que les&#13;
exigences techniques et les conditions de gestion optimale de differents services sont&#13;
&#13;

imp6rativement a prendre en compte pour determiner les prochaines etapes de la decentralisation.&#13;
Elles conditionnent les competences que peuvent assumer de facon realiste les differentes&#13;
communes et les modalites de repartition des differents services. 11 est donc demande de dresser une&#13;
liste des differentes categories de communes dans cette optique. Cette analyse des communes&#13;
urbaines devra etre coordonnee avec les travaux en cours sur les communes rurales financ6s par les&#13;
projets "D6veloppement economique de la vallee" et "Gestion des ressources naturelles". A titre&#13;
d'exemple, le rapport Hoang (Cadre d'action pour le D6veloppement communal en Mauritanie,&#13;
1993) propose de regrouper les communes en trois categories: Nouakchott et Nouadhibou, les 43&#13;
autres municipalites urbaines et les 143 communes rurales. Les capacites des differentes&#13;
communes pouvant evoluer avec le temps, il est essentiel de definir egalement un processus et des&#13;
criteres de reclassement qui faciliteront les ajustements necessaires.&#13;
8.     Les comnptences devolues aux communes ont e  definies par une ordonnance de 1987 (cf.&#13;
tableau 1). L'objectif du gouvernement est de permettre aux administr6s d'exprimer leurs&#13;
preferences pour les services dont les b6n6fices sont percus au niveau communal; ces services&#13;
devraient desormais, en principe, etre finances au niveau local. Cependant, certains services ont&#13;
une portee nationale et meritent donc, un support gouvernemental afin de garantir une qualite de&#13;
prestation minimale dans toutes les communes. II faut donc distinguer parmi les services&#13;
communaux ceux dont les benefices sont locaux de ceux dont les benefices sont nationaux et&#13;
pr6parer pour chacun un cadre institutionnel, reglementaire et fiscal approprie.&#13;
9.     Les communes sont encore rarement responsables dans les faits de la prestation des&#13;
services. Afin que le transfert des competences vers les collectivites locales soit effectif, il faut&#13;
commencer par determiner avec precision les intervenants actuels. II faut donc identifier pour&#13;
chaque competence devolue aux communes le principal responsable de facto de la foumiture du&#13;
service et etablir avec precision ses relations avec la commune. Meme lorsque certaines categories&#13;
de collectivit6s locales ne pourront pas prendre en charge l'entiere responsabilite de la prestation de&#13;
services, par exemple, faute de capacite technique, elles pourront neanmoins peser davantage&#13;
qu'actuellement dans la prise des decisions de portee locale. L'objectif majeur est de permettre aux&#13;
communes de jouer un r8le plus important dans l'etablissement de leurs priorites. Par exemple,&#13;
dans le cas de la fourniture d'eau potable, une evolution vers des contrats de concession ou&#13;
d'affermage avec les communes et la r6vision du regime de tutelie et du contrat plan de la Sonelec&#13;
meritent d'etre 6tudiees. Cela permettrait aux collectivites de participer activement aux choix qui&#13;
les concernent, dans la logique du processus de decentralisation envisage.&#13;
10.   L'interaction entre le champ de competences des communes et celui des ministeres&#13;
centraux n6cessite une clarification des r8les. Les relations entre les collectivites locales et les&#13;
ministees doivent &amp;re analys6es et revues (non seulement la DCL au sein du Ministere de&#13;
l'Int6rieur, des Postes et des T6l6communications, responsable de la tutelle des collectivit6s locales,&#13;
mais aussi les differents ministeres responsables de services importants au niveau local: Education&#13;
et Sante, Equipement, Agriculture, Hydraulique...). Quatre perspectives sont a prendre en&#13;
considera*ion:&#13;
a) les prises de decision en matiere d'investissements pour les communes et de gestion des&#13;
services dont celles-ci sont responsables. L'objectif est de parvenir A une definition appropriee et&#13;
r6aliste du r6le des communes qui prenne en compte la typologie des communes, la qualification&#13;
technique necessaire a la prise de certaines decisions, le respect des politiques nationales mais aussi&#13;
le r8le critique des preferences locales dans de nombreux domaines.&#13;
b) la recherche de l'efficacite et de la qualit de la prestation des services par les&#13;
communes. L'entretien des infrastructures et equipements communaux est un instrument majeurs.&#13;
&#13;

Les responsabilites sont donc imperativement a clarifier dans ce domaine. II est 6galemeat essentiel&#13;
de dresser une liste d'indicateurs locaux pour les services principaux afin que population et&#13;
gouverneinent puissent suivre les progres realises. (cf. para 24)&#13;
c) la qualification technique du personnel communal. En fonction de la liste des&#13;
responsabilites attribuees aux les communes etablie ci-dessus (cf. para 8 et 10.a), les competences&#13;
techniques necessaires devront etre precisees. Ceci est essentiel pour la classement des communes&#13;
et l'allocation des responsabilites a ces dernieres. Neanmoins cette liste de competences ne doit etre&#13;
dressee ni utilisee de maniere aveugle et rigide. n faut encourager autant que possible les&#13;
collectivites locales a choisir des m*thodes imovatrices pour assurer les services. Par exemple, les&#13;
collectivites peuvent avoir recours au secteur prive, aux adminiatons centrales ou aux autres&#13;
collectivit6s centrales pour utiliser contractuelUement les capacit6s techniques necessaires, par le&#13;
biais de la delegation de maltrise d'ouvrage. Cette flexibilite et la competition explicite ou implicite&#13;
qui s'ensuit dans la prestation des certains services constituent des avantages qui decoulent de la&#13;
decentralisation. D'autre part, il est tres important que la definition de comp6tences techniques&#13;
n6cessaires aux communes no conduise pas A l'alourdissement des charges fiscales qui d6riverait&#13;
du recrutement de fonctionnaires locaux sous-employes et de frais de formation demesures. La liste&#13;
des competences devrait etre utilisee surtout pour classer les communes et les determiner fonctions&#13;
qu'elles doivent assumer. Elle ne devra pas pour autant forcer les communes A se doter eles-&#13;
m.mes de ces capacites techniques.&#13;
d) la participation du secteur prive au financement et a la gestion des services locaux. Les&#13;
r1glements, lois et montages institutionnels qui ont une portee dans ce domaine sont a revoir afin&#13;
d'6liminer les textes anachroniques, obstacles A l'implication du secteur priv6 dans la prestation&#13;
des services locaux. Dans le contexto mauritanien, il est important de souligner que le secteur prive&#13;
comprend non seulement des firmes et des entrepreneurs individuels, mais aussi des associations&#13;
locales, comme par exemple les associations de parents d'elevds.&#13;
Responsabilit6s des communes- Liste des tiches a effectuer&#13;
* (7) typologie des communes , processus et criteres de classement;&#13;
a  (8) classification des competences devolues aux communes (benefice local ou   national);&#13;
*  (9) identification des responsables defacto de la prestation des services;&#13;
*  (10)        1. definition des relations entre ministeres centraux et collectivit6s locales&#13;
(r6les de chacun, responsabilites, competences techniques).&#13;
2. modifications des reglements, lois, montages institutionnels afin de faciliter&#13;
la participation du secteur prive.&#13;
II- Transferts financiers de l'Etat aux communes&#13;
11. 11 faut revoir et organiser les transferts de fonds entre l'Etat et les collectivit6s locales.&#13;
Dans cette perspective, il faut etudier les systemes de redistribution des revenus du gouvemrnement&#13;
central aux communes sous les deux aspects suivants : d'une part, les taxes et impots et d'autre&#13;
part, le Fonds Regional de D6veloppement et les programmes d'investissenent soutenus par&#13;
l'assistance des bailleurs de fonds.&#13;
L'objectif est d'utiliser de faon optimale les ressources afin premierement de garantir une qualit6&#13;
de base aux services d'intdret national et en second lieu de soutenir les efforts locaux de prise en&#13;
charge, tout en incourageant la bonne gestion fiscale locale et centrale. On s'attachera ainsi:&#13;
a) a encourager le choix rationnel des investissements en fonction de la demande et de la&#13;
volonte de participation financiere des beneficiaires locaux, mais aussi en vue d'une gestion plus&#13;
&#13;

efficace des services (cf indicateurs para. 24), particulierement en matiere d'entretien et de gestion&#13;
financiere locale responsable;&#13;
b) a garantir les services de base et d'importance nationale sur l'ensemnble du territoire,&#13;
surtout pour les pauvres, de facon coherente avec la capacite de financement de ces services; et a&#13;
soutenir les communes qui assurent des services d'intert national (education, sante publique...)&#13;
selon l'attribution des responsabilites aux communes (cf paras 6-9). A cet effet, il faut 6tablir les&#13;
procedures pour allouer aux communes concernees les fonds necessaires a la delivrance de ces&#13;
services. On etablira des garde fous, dans les conditions d'acces a ces fonds, bases sur sur des&#13;
criteres de d'efficacite, d'entretien, et d'acces des populations pauvres aux services, entre autres.&#13;
12.    La grande disparite entre les communes pourrait cr6er des inegalites regionales; si tel etait&#13;
le cas, d'autres transferts pourraient ere justifi6s. II faut identifier a cette fin, les formules qui&#13;
guideraient ces derniers transferts. Toutefois, cela ne devrait pas devenir un moyen majeur de&#13;
financement des communes. En effet, tous les services de base pour les populations pauvres seront&#13;
normalement finances par les systemes de redistribution etablis ci-dessus (cf para 1 .b).&#13;
13.    Dans les deux cas de financement envisages ci-dessus (para. 11 et 12), on elaborera des&#13;
regles pour le financement des investissements. On etablira notanument des recomniandations en&#13;
mati6re d'allocation des ressources apportees par les bailleurs de fonds (qui constituent&#13;
actuellement l'essentiel des fonds d'investissement). Ces recommandations devront ere coh6rentes&#13;
avec les objectifs cites ci-dessus. Dans la mesure du possible ceci devrait inclure les fonds qui&#13;
passent directement par les administrations centrales. On etablira enfin les recommandations de&#13;
base relatives au financement des couts de fonctionnement et de l'entretien.&#13;
14.    Certaines politiques nationales de developpement (social et autres) necessitent actuellement&#13;
des subventions pour certains services. Cependant, la complexite des circuits et des procedures de&#13;
transferts des fonds masquent leurs effets. Les distorsions qui nuisent a la prestation generalisee et&#13;
efficace des services sont particulierement a eviter. En effet, elles se traduisent souvent par des&#13;
redevances pour les usagers des services de base bien en dessous des couits de ces services pour&#13;
certaines categories d'usagers. Dans un souci de transparence et de clarification des objectifs&#13;
gouvemementaux, on identifiera les subventions explicites et implicites au niveau national pour les&#13;
services locaux et on les rattachera, dans la mesure du possible, a des objectifs politiques. On&#13;
reverra les subventions existantes afin d'eliminer celles qui ne sont plus necessaires, puisque les&#13;
mesures envisagees pour la garantie des services des base (cf .para 11 et 12) ont souvent les m8mes&#13;
objectifs sociaux. Dans le cas de l'eau potable, la subvention de certaines categories d'usagers par&#13;
d'autres consommateurs est a etudier, surtout en vue des progres realis6s par la Sonelec dans la&#13;
commercialisation de ses operations. Le but est d'etablir des systemes pragmatiques mais plus&#13;
transparents, ajustes a la capacite financiere du gouvemement et qui introduiraient le minimum de&#13;
distorsions dans l'economie.&#13;

E11- Ressources aux niveaux central et communal&#13;
15.    La situation fiscale reste assez confuse malgr6 la reforme de 1990. Les problemes peuvent&#13;
etre classes selon deux types; le premier est relatif a la complexite du systeme, le second a la&#13;
faiblesse, voire l'absence de rendement. L'objectif est de poursuivre la rationalisation du systmne&#13;
des taxes au niveaux communal et national et d'augmenter les taux de recouvrement.&#13;
Dans une perspective de rationalisation&#13;
16.    Afin d'eviter les conflits d'int6ret entre les niveaux national et communal, on 6tudiera les&#13;
possibilites de rationaliser les taxes doubles (taxe de debarquement des marchandises dans le port&#13;
de Nouakchott, taxe sur le poisson debarque a Nouadhibou). On distinguera d'une part les taxes&#13;
affectant les ressources principalement nationales (TVA, taxes douanieres, taxation des industrie&#13;
de la peche et minieres) et propices a une redistribution ou a un partage eventuel entre les&#13;
communes, et d'autre part les taxes et charges destinees a couvrir les couits des services a benefices&#13;
localises (redevances des couts d'usagers, droits domaniaux) et on les allouera a l'autorit6&#13;
correspondante. Ceci est essentiel pour assurer une base nationale de recettes qui puisse appuyer&#13;
un systeme de decentralisation, tout en respectant les int6rets nationaux. La situation actuelle, selon&#13;
laquelle, pour maintes raisons, certaines municipalites ont des droits de taxation des ressources&#13;
nationales, cree des distorsions peu desirables et affecte n6gativement la capacite financiere du&#13;
gouvernement.&#13;
17.    La collecte des ressources est pour l'instant relativement inefficace en raison d'un manque&#13;
certain d'organisation et de coordination entre les collectivites locales et les ministeres centraux. 11&#13;
faut 6tablir une methode d'organisation des recensements en identifiant les besoins en mat6riel, les&#13;
proc6dures n6cessaires a l'adressage, les relations avec la Direction Generale des Impots, et les&#13;
modalit6s de transfert et de traitement des informations. On veillera particulierement a proposer&#13;
une methode adaptee a certaines particularit6s mauritaniennes (population de 2,300,000 habitants&#13;
et isolement de certaines communes, notamment au nord).&#13;
18.    Afin de favoriser la participation des administres et d'impliquer le conseil municipal dans&#13;
le processus de collecte des ressources, il semble imperatif de tenir compte des differences entre les&#13;
conununes et d'introduire plus de souplesse pour repondre aux choix locaux. On 6tablira la liste&#13;
des taxes qui pourraient &amp;re assez librement determinees par les communes (choix des taux et des&#13;
assiettes). On veillera a proposer des garde-fous (indicateurs de performance, contr6les a&#13;
posteriori) afin d'6viter l'apparition de taux soit prohibitifs soit trop faibles, qui ne manqueraient&#13;
d'entrauner une baisse significative des recettes.&#13;
19.    Une plus grande souplesse dans la fixation des taxes locales ne devrait pas encourager des&#13;
taxes excessivement perturbatrices. La liste des taxes locales admissibles devrait &amp;re 6tudi6e en&#13;
vue de la modification ,voire de l'6limination des taxes locales a incidence globale, peu 6quitables,&#13;
couteuses et lourdes a administrer, et I 'introduction de taxes plus en accord avec les critares cites&#13;
ci-dessus. Bas6 sur l'experience de beaucoup d'autre pays, les taxes a benefice g6n6ral sont&#13;
souvent desirables. Une taxe fonciere structur6e et administree d'une faron appropriee au contexte&#13;
mauritanien est une option interessante a explorer. Mais actuellement l'assiette des taxes foncieres&#13;
est liniitee par l'etroitesse du cadastre et le faible pourcentage des terrains dotes d'un titre foncier.&#13;
Les consultants devraient examiner des alternatives au systeme formel actuel, tels que le permis&#13;
d'occuper et l'adressage, pour restructurer la gestion et l'assiette des taxes foncieres en vue d'en&#13;
augmenter le potentiel.&#13;

Dans une Rerspective de simplification&#13;
20.   Face a la complexite de la determination des assiettes pour certaines taxes, des procedures&#13;
et des imprimes, le personnel communal peu qualifi6 est souvent desarm6. On identifiera les&#13;
possibilites de simplifer et d'assouplir les taxes inoperantes aujourd'hui. Toutefois, on etablira la&#13;
liste des competences minimales requises pour un bonne perception des recettes fiscales&#13;
communales et on en evaluera le cofit selon le type de commune. On etudier les possibilites de&#13;
sous-traiter la perception au gouvernement central, ou autres, pour ameliorer le recouvrement des&#13;
taxes, et on decrira les mesures necessaires correspondantes. On comparera plusieurs alternatives;&#13;
on veillera notamment a ne pas transformer la decentralisation en une deconcentration. Le principe&#13;
devrait etre d'offrir aux communes le choix entre differentes options, tout en conservant leur&#13;
responsabilite finale pour la collecte des taxes locales.&#13;
Redevances des usagers des services&#13;
21.   Le montant de ces redevances (enlevement des ordures menageres, delivrance d'actes&#13;
civils) est fonction de l'ampleur des services rendus par les communes. II varie donc de facon&#13;
significative selon les types de communes. Afin de prendre en compte ces particularites&#13;
communales avec plus de flexibilite, on etudiera les baremes de tarifs des services comnunaux et&#13;
on reverra les principes qui les determinent afin de minimiser l'intervention du gouvernement&#13;
central et de la reglementation dans les redevances sur les services de proximite et a bWn6fice&#13;
purement localis6.&#13;

IV- Cadre incitatif pour les communes&#13;
22.    Le but a atteindre est la responsabilisation des communes vis a vis des populations qu'ellos&#13;
repr6sentent afin d'ameliorer la qualite et l'etendue des services qui leur sont proposes. Le facteur&#13;
mod6rateur est le fait que de nombreuses petites communes no peuvent se doter de toutes les&#13;
comp6tences necessaires sans augmenter de facon deraisonnable les couits fixes A leur charge. On&#13;
envisagera donc les points suivants dans ce but et en prenant en consideration ces differences entre&#13;
les communes.&#13;
23.   Afin de faciliter un collecte accrue des ressources par le conseil municipal, il est&#13;
fondamental d'associer la population locale au processus de d6centralisation. On 6tudiera les&#13;
procedures qui encourageront la participation des administr6s a la gestion financiere de la&#13;
commune et a la prise de decision en matiere d'allocation des ressources. On insistera&#13;
particulierement sur l'identification des informations que la commune devra regulierement&#13;
&#13;

commniquer au public. n1 s'agit notamment des informations sur la gestion des budgets, du&#13;
patrimoine de la commune, les decisions concernant les investissements et les taxes locales.&#13;
24.   L'objectif est de parvenir a un transfert effectif de pouvoir aux communes et, si possible, a&#13;
un allegement du contr8le gouvernemental. La tutelle devrait se fonder de plus en plus sur le&#13;
contr6le ex post des r6sultats et des moyens employes plut6t que sur la contrainte des autorisations&#13;
prealabled. On etudiera les formalites et pratiques de la tutelle pour mettre en place ce processus de&#13;
facon prudente, selon les types de communes. Pour etre efficace, ce transfert de competences doit&#13;
etre accompagne d'une politique de soutien et de contr8le des communes par les ministeres&#13;
centraux. On etablira des indicateurs significatifs pour faciliter le contr6le de la performance des&#13;
prestations de services (etendue geographique, qualite, fiabilite et entretien en particulier) et de la&#13;
gestion financiere de la commune. On s'attachera a d6velopper le contr8le des resultats plutot que&#13;
celui des moyens utilises.&#13;
25.   La decentralisation s'accompagne d'une modification du r6le des ministeres centraux. Ces&#13;
derniers doivent a terme coordonner et soutenir les communes; ce changement devrait aller de pair&#13;
avec l'augmentation attendue des capacites des communes. Dans cette optique, il serait intressant&#13;
de suivre l'evolution des capacites et de comparer la qualite des services. Ainsi, on etablira des&#13;
indicateurs de performance pour les services dont les benefices sont localises et qui sont fournis a)&#13;
par les ministeres ou les entreprises publiques, b) par les communes elles-memes, et c) par le&#13;
secteur prive (concession, affermage...).&#13;
26.   Afin de clarifier en particulier les relations entre la Direction des Collectivites Locales et&#13;
les communes, on etablira des processus simples de communication. On etudiera de meme le r6le&#13;
de la Direction Generale des Imp8ts, et on proposera des procedures de cooperation afin de&#13;
coordonner l'effort de recensement au niveau national et de mettre en place un systeme fiable de&#13;
collecte des donn6es.&#13;
27.    Pour impliquer davantage les communes dans les decisions qui les concement en matiere&#13;
d'investissements et de gestion des services locaux, on reverra les procedure de tutelle et le contrat&#13;
plan des entreprises publiques. Sclon le type de communes, on etablira des possibilites de choix,&#13;
pour les communes, entre les entreprises publiques et le secteur prive.&#13;

d'ouvrage publics Mauritaniens de realiser des operations d'investissement en utilisant la&#13;
procede du mandat, ou maltrise d'ouvrage deleguee, et d'en apprecier 1'efficacit6. Le&#13;
Gouvernement envisage de g6neraliser cette possibilite, actuellement limitee a une agence&#13;
d'execution des travaux, de maniere I englober dans le champ d'application de la loi&#13;

ei quelles que soient les modalites de son intervention. Le gouvernement a donc decider de&#13;
commander une etude ayant pour objet l'elaboration d'un projet de loi relatif I la mattrise&#13;

La maltrise d'ouvrage deleguee est un mode d'execution des etudes, des travaux publics et de&#13;
gestion des services publics, par lequel un mattre d'ouvrage public confie par contrat I un&#13;
mandataire, le maitre d'ouvrage delegue, l'ex6cution de travaux ou la gestion d'un service.&#13;
Le maitre d'ouvrage ne se dessaisit pas de ses competences; il lui appartient de definir le&#13;
contenu des etudes, le programme des travaux ou la mission de gestion I confler au mattre&#13;
d'ouvrage delegue. II negocie la convention qui precise en particulier les modalites d'execution&#13;
et de financement de la mission. n1 en contr6le l'execution.&#13;
Le maitre d'ouvrage delegue est choisi en raison de ses competences et de son expertise&#13;
technique. II est tenu d'executer sa mission selon les modalites fixees par convention, et dans&#13;
les limites financibres fixees, et d'en rendre compte au maitre d'ouvrage.&#13;
Les avantages de la mattrise d'ouvrage deleguee sont principalement:&#13;
*  une  concentration  du  maltre  d'ouvrage  public  sur  ses  tiches  fondamentales&#13;
(programmation, definition des objectifs et des moyens, controle), et l'allegement correlatif&#13;
de ses taches de gestion;&#13;
* Ia souplesse de mise en oeuvre et la transparence des relations contractuelles (Oa convention&#13;
de mattrise d'ouvrage deleguee precise les obligations reciproques du maftre d'ouvrage et&#13;
du maitre d'ouvrage delegue);&#13;

ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION&#13;
Criteria for the eligibility of sub-projects include economic, financial and technical justification&#13;
prepared in a summary sheet by the requesting municipality. Due to the small scale of sub-projects, a&#13;
simplified economic appraisal procedure has been set-up under the CCEP using computer software to&#13;
calculate the ERR. To ensure simplicity, consistency and transparency no shadow pricing was used.&#13;
A.     How to calculate the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) (excerpt from the&#13;
implementation manual): The ERR is calculated to quantify project benefits. ERR is defined as a rate of&#13;
return which negates Net Present Value (NPV), i.e.&#13;
NPV (ERR, f(l), f(2), ..., 1f(n)) =If (k)   -o  for n years of project life,&#13;
where f(k)     =      (Net Cash Flow)k&#13;
=      (Project Benefit)k - (Project Cost)k&#13;
=      [(Benefit with Project)k - (Benefit without Project)kJ&#13;
- [(Cost with Project)k - (Cost without Project)kJ&#13;
for any year k&#13;
Take the rehabilitation of a classroom as an example for calculating the ERR. The classroom is&#13;
deteriorated and is estimated to need full reconstruction in six years. The municipality has to determine&#13;
whether to rehabilitate it now or to rebuild it in six years. The construction of a new classroom is&#13;
estimated to cost 1,000,000 UM and the rehabilitation is estimated to cost 350,000 UM, and the&#13;
maintenance is estimated to cost 10,000 UM per year. Net Cash Flow for years 1 to 6 is estimated as fgl)&#13;
= -350,000, f(2) to f(5) =-10,000, and f(6) = -10,000-(-1,000,000) = 990,000, and ERR is (or 21%).&#13;
A sensitivity analysis with shadow pricing the wages of unskilled workers at 50% would lead to an ERR&#13;
of 22%&#13;
Under the proposed project shadow pricing the wages of unskilled workers at 50% will be used&#13;
and the implementation manual will be modified accordingly.&#13;
B.     Actual ERRs (under the CCEP).&#13;
The following proxy ERR ranges are actual, expost calculations from the ongoing portfolio&#13;
without shadow pricing the unskilled labor.&#13;
Economic sub-projects: both new investment and rehabilitation must have an economic rate of&#13;
return superior to 12% to be eligible for project funding. Actual ERR ranges are as follows:&#13;
*  Road enhancement or rehabilitation: 7 sub-projects with ERR ranges from 31% to 47% and an&#13;
average 38%. The main benefit is lower transport costs;&#13;
* Fixing of sand dunes: 2 sub-projects with ERRs of 42% and 51%. The main benefits are saving&#13;
on sand removing operations after sand storms and lower transport costs;&#13;
*  Storm drainag: 4 sub-projects with ERR from 25% to 32% and an average 30°. The benefit is&#13;
the protection against flood damage to households and economic inrastructure;&#13;
*  Administrative buildings in new and poor areas of Nouakchott: 4 sub-projects with ERR ranges&#13;
from 17% to 25% and an average of 22o/o. The benefit is savings on rent;&#13;
* Rehabilitation public facilities such as classrooms, health centers and administrative buildings:&#13;
29 sub-projects with ERR ranges from .21%. to 119% with an average of 36%. The benefit is&#13;
saving total reconstruction some years later;&#13;

Revenue-earnings projects: While none have been financed by IDA, Germany is financing 8 sub-&#13;
projects with ERR ranges from 19% to 47% and average of 33%. Under the proposed project the&#13;
minimum rate of financial return for the sub-project to be eligible will be 15% and management will&#13;
be contracted out to avoid increases of municipal staff. For example, under the CCEP, the&#13;
rehabilitation of the slaughterhouse of ALEG costs UM1.2 million and brings to the municipality an&#13;
annual additional income of UM468,000, which takes into account maintenance costs of UM25,000,&#13;
resulting in a NPV of UM1.5 million and an ERR of 29 percent;&#13;
Social projects: Construction of primary classrooms will be undertaken only in case of emergency&#13;
and upon special request from the Minister of education. Other social projects will follow sectoral&#13;
policies and procedures when they exist. Otherwise, the selection will be based on a low ratio&#13;
cost/number of beneficiaries.&#13;
Municipal management projects would have a fiscal justification such the rehabilitation of a tax&#13;
collection office with a rate of return of 61%. The benefit is enhanced tax collection. Other examples&#13;
are street and property numbering to facilitate tax collection and private business operations. Cost&#13;
per lot is US$3 compared to USS40 for full cadasters. The expected additional revenue over three&#13;
years would be more than twice the investment costs.&#13;
3.     Alternative options. Experience in Mauritania and Senegal has shown that lower prices (by 10-&#13;
15 percent) and equal or higher quality of works are achieved through the AGETIPE model. This is due&#13;
to increased competition between contractors and the rapid payment through contract management&#13;
procedures (Implementation Completion Report for the Senegal Publics and Employment Project and the&#13;
CCEP Mid-term review). The use of local consultants for design of works and for PIP inventories would&#13;
further develop local capacity at a lower cost that the hiring of staff in each city or extensively using of&#13;
expatriates.&#13;
4.     Beneficiary participation to financing. Beneficiary municipalities will have to pay upfront a part of the&#13;
cost of their sub-projects as shown in the table below. This has proved under the CCEP an efficient way to ensure&#13;
beneficiary ownership, strong commitment and rigorous selectivity.&#13;

5.     Operating Costs. The two following tables show the impact of additional operating costs and additional&#13;
revenues resulting from the implementation of the program of sub-projects. After project completion the annual&#13;
additional revenue (USS1,435,000) is higher than the annual additional operating costs (US$839,000).&#13;

            Mauritania - Urban Infrastructure and Pilot
            Decentralization Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Urban
            Infrastructure and Pilot Decentralization Project are to: 1)
            create new temporary employment opportunities in rapidly
            growing urban and peri-urban areas; 2) help municipalities
            create or rehabilitate basic, urgent infrastructure assets;
            and 3) develop municipal capacity to manage these assets and
            help the Ministry of Interior, Posts, and Telecommunications
            (MOI) to play its tutorship role. The project will have two
            components: 1) a program of poverty-oriented,
            labor-intensive works sub-projects which will fall into the
            following categories: (a) economic infrastructure projects;
            (b) social infrastructure projects; (c) municipal
            income-generating projects; and (d) municipal management
            projects; and 2) capacity building (pilot decentralization)
            including: (a) infrastructure planning and urban space
            management; (b) management reform; (c) training of municipal
            staff and elected officials; (d) capacity strengthening of
            the Directorale of Local Government of MOI (DCL), the
            Decentralization Technical Coordination Committee (DTCC),
            and the Association of Mayors; and (e) reform of the legal
            and regulatory municipal framework.
