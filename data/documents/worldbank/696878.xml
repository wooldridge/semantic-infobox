This report is based on sector discussions over the period Februaiy- October 1995 between the Governmcnt and&#13;
the Bank and Association and CDB. A reconmaissance/identification mission of Febnrary 1995 was fbllowed by&#13;
a Bank preparation mission of April 1995. Some studies on the education sector in Grenada were undertaken by&#13;
international experts over the period June-October 1995. A June 1995 mission consisting of Mr. Ralph Romain&#13;
(Principal Education Specialist, HDD), and Mr. Marco Mantovanelli (LA3HR consultant) appraised the project.&#13;
Ms. Karen Lashman, who conducted the February identification mission, assisted in reviewing the Report. Ms.&#13;
Marie-Christine Theodore provided support in document production. Peer reviewers, Ms. Marlaine Lockheed&#13;
(HDD) and Mr. Richard Cambndge (SA2DR), reviewed the IEPS for the OECS Basic Education Project from&#13;
which this project was developed. The Department Director, Project Adviser and Sector Division Chief are&#13;
Messieurs Paul Isenman, Robert Crown, and Julian Schweitzer respectively.&#13;

BASIC EDUCATION REFORM PROJECT&#13;
1. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1    Grenada is the most southerly member country of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States&#13;
(OECS), with an estimated population of 91,000 in 1993. The country has traditionally depended on&#13;
agriculture (nutmeg, mace, cocoa and bananas) and its beaches and scenery offer potential for tourism&#13;
development. In the period 1983-88, real GDP growth was about five percent. Because of reduced prices&#13;
for nutmegs (the main agricultural crop) and deteriorating public finances, this growth slowed over the&#13;
period 1989-91, arrears accumulated and public sector imbalances widened. In 1992, the Government&#13;
carried out a "home grown adjustment program" which improved the overall public sector balance and&#13;
reduced total arrears. The size of the civil service was reduced and some State enterprises were privatized.&#13;
By 1994, with improvement in fiscal performance and in the management of debt and arrears, Grenada was&#13;
considered creditworthy for Bank lending. The economy is projected to grow by 2-3% over the medium&#13;
term, limited by power and water shortages that constrain tourism development, a still fragile fiscal&#13;
situation, and low prices for nutmegs. Social indicators reflect relatively high standards of living, although&#13;
some pockets of poverty exist. CDB is conducting a poverty assessment and the results are expected early&#13;
in 1996. Environmental awareness is high. Basic economic and social data on the country are provided in&#13;
Annex 1.&#13;
1.2    The country faces a difficult period of economic transition that will depend largely on success in&#13;
developing its human resources so as to produce for the labor force persons with a good general education,&#13;
who can be trained and adapt themselves to take advantage of emerging opportunities in areas such as&#13;
information, banking and tourism and to be more productive in the traditional areas such as agriculture.&#13;
For this to be achieved, standards of education and learning must be raised significantly through a major&#13;
reform of the education sector, with special attention to enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of the&#13;
education system, and the equity of access to educational opportunities.&#13;
1.3   In order to promote growth, the Govemment needs to (a) continue to increase public savings, by&#13;
simplifying the tax structure, and broadening the tax base, lowering domestic debt service, persevering with&#13;
the retrenchment program and avoiding general wage increases; (b) enhance private sector led growth by&#13;
increased investment in the power and water sectors and improvement in the incentive regime and&#13;
regulatory framework; and (c) address the issues in education which are principally (i) the weakness of&#13;
sector management and planning, (ii) qualitative shortcomings (particularly in primary and secondary&#13;
education) and (iii) the shortage of places in basic education, especially at the secondary level.&#13;
1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2. SECTORAL CONTEXT&#13;
A. Current Educational Situation&#13;
2.1    With strong Government commitment to education in Grenada, recurrent budgetary allocations to&#13;
the sector have been about 17 percent--somewhat more modest than the 22-25 percent level in St. Lucia,&#13;
but generally above world averages. During the austerity of the "home grown adjustment program" of&#13;
1992-94, the education sector suffered its share of budget cuts, especially in areas such as management and&#13;
maintenance that usually result in long term weaknesses. Yet, the system has its strengths. In the public&#13;
sector, there are 59 public primary schools (of which 16 are Government and the rest denominational), four&#13;
centers (for home economics and industrial arts) and two schools for the handicapped; the private sector&#13;
has 15 primary schools accommodating 617 children. These schools, therefore, accommodated 23,027&#13;
students overall in 1993-94 or about 95 percent of the 5-15 age group. Thus, the country has achieved&#13;
almost universal primary education. There are 75 pre-school centers (including some that share primary&#13;
school premises). There are also 18 public secondary schools (six government and 12 government-&#13;
assisted--including Anglican, Catholic, Seventh Day Adventist and Methodist) and one private secondary&#13;
school. These accommodated 7,205 students in 1993-94 or 78 percent of the estimated 9,220 in the 12-16&#13;
age cohort (Annex 2 Table 1). However, this enrollment included some 1,646 students who were 17+ years&#13;
of age and so the net enrollment ratio was only 60 percent.&#13;
2.2    The actual number of children enrolled in primary schools has been falling slightly but steadily in&#13;
recent years, partly because of absorption (although on a limited scale) of children at age 12+ into the&#13;
secondary schools, but mainly because of spasmodic emigration and a slowdown in population growth. It&#13;
is also believed that some children of school age are not enrolled, although these numbers are not&#13;
considerable. Declines are projected from 1996 onward in the 5-14 age group, following an increase&#13;
between 1991 and 1996.&#13;
2.3    There are inequities in access to learning opportunities. Many primary schools are seriously&#13;
overcrowded, particularly in and around St. George's (the capital city) and Grenville and this hampers&#13;
delivery of good quality education. The project preparatory school location planning exercise indicated that&#13;
there was no need to expand capacity at the primary level, but noted also that many of the existing places&#13;
are in an unsatisfactory state of repair. Serious access problems also exist at the secondary school level.&#13;
The distribution of secondary school places favors St. George's and this imposes high transport costs on&#13;
families in the more remote areas of the country.&#13;
2.4    As in the OECS countries and in the Caribbean generally, access to secondary school places is&#13;
govemed by a competitive Common Entrance Examination (CEE), commonly known as the 11 + exam,&#13;
given at the end of Grade 6. The stakes on this exam are exceptionally high, as perceived by students,&#13;
parents and teachers. "Succeeding" in the CEE -- gaining a secondary school place -- is the main drive&#13;
among primary teachers and students, particularly at the upper grade levels, thereby distorting teaching&#13;
practices away from mastery of the curriculum and toward the areas to be tested by the examination.&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.5    The number of children admitted to the first year of secondary schools corresponds to less than half&#13;
of the number of CEE candidates and to the number of available places rather than to any pass mark.'&#13;
Hence, the low transition rates from primary to secondary reflect constraints in the supply of places not in&#13;
the demand for them. In recent years that demand has been met by expanding existing secondary schools&#13;
and converting Junior secondary (three-year lower cycle) schools into five-year schools, so that, despite&#13;
fluctuations from year to year, an enrollment increase of 20.8 percent has occurred over the period 1980-&#13;
1994. (Annex 2, Table 2).&#13;
2.6    Large numbers of children each year have little choice after age 11 but to continue in all-age&#13;
primary schools (in a post primary program supplemented by practical subject centers for home economics&#13;
and industrial arts). These students account for 20 percent of the total primary enrollment. The shortages&#13;
of qualified teachers to serve these post-primary sections of primary schools, coupled with the lower&#13;
standards applied in the curriculum itself, suggest limited value-added to the education of youth in the&#13;
program. For most of these students, this schooling is the terminal point in their formal education. A&#13;
fortunate few receive a second chance in the 14+ examination known as the School Leaving Examination,&#13;
on the results of which they may be placed in available places at regular secondary schools,2 graduating&#13;
from the secondary school one year later than if they had entered through the CEE.&#13;
2.7    The repeater rate at secondary level is about 13 percent and is highest in the upper Forms (3-5).&#13;
The policy on grade repetition is not centrally controlled and some schools allow no repeating of Form 5;&#13;
however, some 23 percent of the secondary enrollment are beyond the age of 16. The dropout rate is low--&#13;
only 112 or 1.6 percent of enrollment dropped out in 1992-93, which translates into a completion rate of&#13;
about 92 percent, reflecting, in part, the great importance attached by society to such education. At&#13;
primary level, the dropout rate is negligible--less than 1.3 percent in 1992-93; however, the repeater rate is&#13;
high (10 percent), principally in the early grades and at the stage of the CEE and School Leaving&#13;
Certificate examinations.&#13;
2.8    Despite the progress made to date in expanding access to secondary education, the overall shortfall&#13;
in places remains significant. With the current cohort of secondary school age, the total number of&#13;
secondary places would have to be increased by 3,661 or almost 40 percent to secure universal access to&#13;
secondary education. Thus, even with the planned addition of 665 secondary places under this project,&#13;
universal coverage of this age group would not be attainable until the first decade of the next century unless&#13;
significant additional resources can be mobilized and efficiency measures adopted with respect to the&#13;
utilization of teachers and physical facilities.&#13;
'Only one secondary school does not always manage to fill all available places and this is because it is in so&#13;
remote area.&#13;
20f the 598 candidates who sat this exam from primary schools in 1994, 108 passed and 43 of these were placed&#13;
in 10 secondary schools. A further 28 were placed in the T.A. Marryshow Community College and the St.&#13;
Patrick's Training Center.&#13;
3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B. The Organizational Structure and Institutional Framework&#13;
2.9    Organizational Structure of the School System. As in other countries in the sub-region, the&#13;
education system is organized into four principal levels--pre-school, primary, secondary and tertiary&#13;
education (Annex 2. Chart 1: Structure of the School System).&#13;
2.10   For the purposes of this Report, Basic Education comprises the primary grades and the lower cycle&#13;
of secondary education (Grades 1-9). Pre-school education is voluntary and still in its early stages of&#13;
development. An estimated 3,600 children or about 50 percent of the 3-4 age group attend at least some&#13;
pre-school programs, which are privately financed, with the Government paying towards the cost of&#13;
temporary teaching and auxiliary staff3. Students commence their compulsory education cycle at five years&#13;
of age at the primnary level which is organized into seven classes called "grades" in Grenada, ending at&#13;
"Grade 7" which corresponds to Grade 6 in international terms4. For children not continuing to secondary&#13;
schools, the primary schools offer a senior primary section leading to the School Leaving Certificate.&#13;
2.11   Secondary schools offer a five-year course of study, organized into a lower cycle (Forms 1-3) and&#13;
an upper cycle (Forms 4-5). Upon completion of Form 5, students sit the Caribbean Examinations Council&#13;
(CXC) and/or General Certification of Education (GCE) Examination and those who perform well enough&#13;
have the option of either moving into tertiary education or, along with other graduates, going into select&#13;
jobs in the public and private sectors.&#13;
2.12   The country has one tertiary education institution--the T.A. Marryshow Comnmunity College&#13;
(TAMCC). TAMCC offerings include the GCE advance level program, associate degree courses in Arts&#13;
and Applied Arts and Science and Applied Science, Craftsmen and Technician certificates, courses in&#13;
Adult and Continuing Education and the Teacher's diploma. Students wishing to pursue more advanced&#13;
studies attend overseas institutions of higher learning. The UWI has an Extra-Mural center in St. George's&#13;
which offers a limited number of UWI courses, some of which count toward a degree.&#13;
2.13   The Institutional Framework.  Responsibility for educational policy and programs is vested in&#13;
the Ministry of Education (MOE). In addition to formulating education policy and standards, MOE&#13;
designs and oversees the operation of the school system, consistent with its mandate under the Education&#13;
Act (No. 13 of 1976). MOE also oversees the Library system.&#13;
2.14   Organizationally, under the Minister, the administrative head of the Ministry is the Permanent&#13;
Secretary. The discrete sections are: (i) Administration, (ii) Education, (iii) Public Library and (iv) the&#13;
National Commission for UNESCO (Annex 2, Chart 2: Existing Organigram of the Ministry of&#13;
Education). The Administration Section is responsible for all financial management (budgeting and&#13;
accounting) and for personnel administration as well as miscellaneous items, including Stores and Supplies.&#13;
The Education Section is managed by the Chief Education Officer (CEO), who is assisted by a team of&#13;
professional staff, including three Senior Education Officers (SEOs) for (1) Policy and Planning&#13;
(comprising Testing and Measurement, Examinations and Statistics); (2) Schools (under whom come the&#13;
school supervisory service and the schools) and (3) Curriculum (comprising curriculum design and&#13;
supervision and guidance and counseling). The CEO also oversees the unit responsible for maintenance of&#13;
the physical plant of schools. The overall administration is centralized in terns of personnel, resources and&#13;
3The 1995 Estimates provide a sum of ECS1.5 million for this purpose.&#13;
4This is because the infants (ages 5 and 6) in effect go through a kindergarten and a Grade I stage in the first&#13;
two years, but these are counted as two Grades in Grenada.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
decision making, with limited discretionary authority assigned to the school level. During the structural&#13;
adjustment program, several posts were abolished in an already understaffed Head Office. A significant&#13;
role for the Church in education is formally exercised through denominational Boards, each of which has&#13;
school management responsibilities and the authority to propose to MOE a shortlist of candidates for the&#13;
post of principal in the respective denominational schools.&#13;

3. SECTOR ISSUES AND GOVERNMENT STRATEGY&#13;
A. Issues&#13;
(1) Quality and Effectiveness of Teaching and Learning&#13;
3.1    Management of the System.    The most serious obstacle to improvement in the sector lies in the&#13;
weakness of the MOE Head Office. The Ministry has survived and even offered some of leadership to the&#13;
school system only through the dedicated work of a small number of persons. Supporting a reform effort&#13;
will require significant strengthening of MOE staff at all levels. The school system is now under-managed.&#13;
Up-to-date education legislation is now being prepared to replace the existing Education Act. The new Act&#13;
and related regulations are urgently needed, but would require to be supported by the institutional capacity&#13;
to apply them effectively. Planning has been almost moribund since 1979. The detailed sector analysis&#13;
needed as a basis for sound sector planning has not as yet been done. The social sector planning unit&#13;
established in 1993 in the Ministry of Finance and Planning is as yet unable to assist in developing&#13;
education sector planning. However, sector development requires the benefit of a framework such as a well&#13;
considered plan. The various technical services in MOE (curriculum, statistics, testing etc.) lack basic&#13;
equipment and trained specialists and are grossly under-staffed. Strengthening school supervision to play&#13;
an important role in leading the system toward reform and greater efficiency will require appropriately&#13;
trained administrative and curriculum supervisors and a rational and duly applied system of annual&#13;
evaluation of teachers and principals that encourages good performance.5 In the administrative fields of&#13;
personnel and financial management, there is a similar weakness in the level (rank), numbers, training and&#13;
equipping of staff. In a sector that spends 17 percent of the national recurrent budget, systematic financial&#13;
analysis is necessary. Finally, overall, the Ministry is badly housed in buildings that offer little protection&#13;
against fire and the destruction of records and in rooms that are not always adequately ventilated and&#13;
illuminated. There is a serious shortage of storage space, modem office equipment and information&#13;
resources.&#13;
3.2    Student Achievement.  Educational testing to date has been conducted on a national basis only for&#13;
terminal examinations of attainment, with the results serving some screening purpose for admission to the&#13;
next level of education or, in the case of external examinations and some craft and technician exams, for&#13;
entry into jobs. No indicators exist to determine and compare, on a system-wide basis, the quality of&#13;
primary or secondary education within the respective cycle, either in individual schools or across schools.&#13;
Promotion is generally automatic, with no professionally designed test of achievement at the end of each&#13;
grade and, hence, no nationally valid indication of a student's mastery of subject matter until the end of the&#13;
primary cycle (when the CEE selects students for available secondary places on the basis of their score and&#13;
preference for particular schools) or at the end of the secondary cycle (when the CXC and GCE&#13;
examinations are taken).&#13;
3.3    Student scores on the CEE show weaknesses that are pronounced in some rural primary schools&#13;
and in some subject areas--spelling and the use of the dictionary and encyclopedia--as well as other core&#13;
areas such as science. Girls usually outperform boys in all subjects in the CEE; nine of the first ten places&#13;
5A new general evaluation system for the public service is now being prepared.&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and 55 of the first 100 places in the order of merit were taken by girls in 1994. This under-performance of&#13;
boys is a source of concern.&#13;
3.4   Inadequate information exists to adequately assess the quality of secondary education. The&#13;
relatively high secondary school completion rates belie the significant obstacles to learning that many&#13;
encounter, which include a large proportion of untrained teachers and inadequate equipment and supplies in&#13;
key subject areas (such as the sciences) and the poor condition of some physical plant.&#13;
3.5    Student and parental preference for "traditional" secondary schools, which generally achieve the&#13;
highest average CXC scores, effectively streams children among schools according to their CEE scores.&#13;
From the 1994 CEE, the four prestigious St. George's schools received 76 of the first 100 students in the&#13;
order of merit, including one school that received 31; 1 I more went to the two prestigious Grenville schools&#13;
and the remaining 13 were shared among the other 12 schools. In one of these 12 schools, the highest&#13;
ranking entrant was 407th in the order of merit. The disparities in performance by secondary school in the&#13;
CXC reflects in some ways this lopsidedness in the sharing of the talented students at 11+. Three of the&#13;
prestigious St. George's schools had subject pass percentages in the 1994 CXC Examination of 72.5, 70&#13;
and 69, compared to an average of 52 for all of the Grenada public secondary schools and 31 and 32&#13;
percent in the lowest rated schools.&#13;
3.6    Performances in the CXC exam indicate unsatisfactory levels of student mastery of curricula&#13;
throughout the system, with notably weak performances in English, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and&#13;
Biology.&#13;
3.7    Factors Contributini to Low Achievement.  To date, no systematic analysis has been&#13;
undertaken of the causes of low student performance. In the view of the MOE staff, however, the key&#13;
contributing factors include: (a) quantitative and qualitative problems with regard to major education&#13;
system inputs, particularly the teaching cadre, educational equipment and supplies, and facilities;&#13;
(b) inadequate supervision of instructional delivery by specialized curriculum officers and by principals;&#13;
(c) weak articulation of curricula and educational standards within and between grades; (d) distortion of the&#13;
primary curriculum by the pressure of competition for secondary school places; (e) weak institutional&#13;
capacity to plan, manage or monitor performance of the school system so that it can be adjusted in a timely&#13;
way to respond to the needs of students of wide ability ranges, and (f) the absence of training for school&#13;
principals.&#13;
3.8    Teacher Oualifications. The study of teacher training conducted during project preparation&#13;
stressed the need for urgent qualitative measures relating to teachers and teaching throughout basic&#13;
education. High proportions of unqualified teachers are engaged in the system--only 43 percent at primary&#13;
level are trained. At the secondary level, only 32.5 percent of the teachers have university degrees and most&#13;
of these have not been professionally trained. The situation is particularly critical at the primary level,&#13;
adversely affecting teaching and learning in the core subjects: English, mathematics, social studies and&#13;
science. As of June 1995, the Teacher Training Department of the T.A. Marryshow College had nine&#13;
tutors (including one Peace Corps person) none of whom was a specialist in Social Studies. The science&#13;
and language laboratories of the Department lack equipment and supplies and the library is short of audio-&#13;
visual aids and reading materials for both the trainees and the tutors. The Department offers induction&#13;
courses to new recruits into the teaching profession, on an in-service basis, in two Centers (St. George's&#13;
and Grenville). A Center in Carriacou has been inactive in recent years because of budgetary constraints.&#13;
3.9    The conclusion of observers within the system is that there is no visible difference between the&#13;
classroom performance of trained teachers and that of untrained ones--an observation that was made by&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
expert teams in St. Lucia as well. The Department at TAMCC ascribes this to the above difficulties under&#13;
which the Department functions and to:&#13;
* the difficult and distracting conditions under which the teachers teach;&#13;
* the fact that trainees enter the training program with such low levels of competence in basic&#13;
subjects (geography, science, mathematics and English) that much of the training energies are&#13;
absorbed in content instruction, to the partial neglect of professional development;&#13;
* the UWI curricular requirements that are not well related to realities in the schools, with too&#13;
much emphasis placed on research;&#13;
* the inability of the Ministry (for whom the teachers are being trained) to influence program&#13;
content, and&#13;
* the insufficiency of practice teaching in the training program.&#13;
3.10   The issue in primary teacher training is also quantitative. In 1995, there were only 361 trained&#13;
teachers (of whom 80 are mnale) in the total staff of 847. In 1995 there were only 85 students enrolled in&#13;
the full-time diploma program --46 in year 1 and 39 in year 2. The rate at which trained teachers are being&#13;
produced (less than 50 per year) needs to be significantly raised. There are over 200 persons in the&#13;
teaching service who have taken the diploma program and failed. These continue to receive in-service&#13;
training to help them pass the exam. Even if staffing needs remained stable and the annual output climbed&#13;
to 50, it would not be before the year 2009 that the service would be fully trained. With a 50 percent&#13;
increase in staff, the Department believes that it can double the intake; an increase to 12 would appear&#13;
feasible, especially if, with strengthening of the rules and methods of selection of persons for entry into the&#13;
profession, along with qualitative improvements in the program, the attrition rate among the full time&#13;
trainees can be reduced. Various measures have been considered to accelerate the production of trained&#13;
teachers, including the use of distance teaching and the addition of a pre-service training program. In the&#13;
light of the intended sector planning, it would be best to have the various options considered in the context&#13;
of the overall development of the sector.&#13;
3.11   Teacher training problems are compounded by several factors, including the limited outreach of the&#13;
teacher trainers and the limited availability of in-service training programs for teachers after their formal&#13;
training. In pursuit of increased professionalization of the teaching corps, over recent years the&#13;
Government has raised the entry requirements for admission to the training program. However, the only&#13;
CXC subject pass that is specifically identified as a pre-requisite for entry into teacher training program is&#13;
English. All new candidates for the teaching service would be required to have at least four CXC passes&#13;
including both English and mathematics. While this is a step in the right direction, even more rigorous&#13;
teacher training program admission requirements are required and these need to be incorporated into the&#13;
new Education Act and Regulations that are being prepared. Additionally, since the teachers entering&#13;
training are drawn from teachers already working in the system, complementary steps will need to be taken&#13;
to raise the entry level for recruitment into the teaching profession.&#13;
3.12   Throughout the system, teacher performance is also adversely affected by poor physical working&#13;
conditions. The lack of basic educational materials and equipment to support classroom teaching and&#13;
learning, and of minimum physical plant requirements, including electricity, water and sanitation facilities,&#13;
constitutes an obstacle to efficient performance. On a positive note, teachers' salaries, which were among&#13;
the poorest in the OECS, were increased in May 1995. However, the new salary scales offer little incentive&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
to degree holders to obtain advanced degrees or diplomas and place teacher trainers in very&#13;
disadvantageous position. The Government intends to review the salary scales and classification scheme to&#13;
ensure some incentives for persons to obtain advanced qualifications.&#13;
3.13   Performance Evaluation.     Educational research has shown that the quality of education is&#13;
highly correlated with the intensity of supervision and monitoring and feedback in the system. Grenada is&#13;
preparing measures to strengthen performance monitoring of the public servants generally. The institution&#13;
of regular, system-wide school performance review is necessary and although, some perfornance&#13;
evaluations of teachers and principals are conducted, and it is theoretically possible to follow up on these if&#13;
performance improvements do not occur, in practice, the system does not carry much weight and is not&#13;
rigorously applied. The lack of systematic performance evaluations hampers attainment of desired quality&#13;
improvements.&#13;
3.14   Curricula.    The Curriculum Unit, established in 1985, is charged with developing curricula&#13;
and teaching materials and overseeing the application of curricula in the schools. The unit is inadequately&#13;
equipped for all of these responsibilities. It contains an establishment of staff (one in each core subject and&#13;
two who are devoted to guidance counseling) none of whom has been specially trained in the fields covered&#13;
by the Unit--(i) development and supervision of curricula and syllabi and (ii) the preparation and&#13;
production of teaching materials. Nor does it have staff trained in the closely related field of educational&#13;
testing and measurement.&#13;
3.15   (i) Curriculum Development.  For some years, the Ministry has been attempting to rewrite the&#13;
syllabi for primary education. The pace has been slow, although some good achievements have been&#13;
recorded. For the design of curricula in an expeditious manner, trained curriculum development specialists&#13;
are needed in each of the core curricular areas-science, social studies, mathematics and English. With&#13;
regard to the actual curricula, at the primary level, analysis in other OECS countries has shown that syllabi&#13;
and teaching tend to focus predominantly on teaching of basic facts, with limited attention to developing&#13;
critical thinking skills or fostering student research and investigation, even in such core subjects as science.&#13;
Comments by educators in Grenada suggest that the Grenadian situation contains similar features.&#13;
Curriculum upgrading is needed in all core subjects. Expert analysis in Dominica and St. Lucia has also&#13;
indicated a serious problem in English which may be linked to the use of English "Creole" and French&#13;
"Creole". In Grenada, English is recognized as a weak area in primary and secondary schools and some&#13;
review of the language arts practices and policy needs to be undertaken, with special attention to the&#13;
potential in the early primary school years to build bridges between English and "Creole".&#13;
3.16   Curricula at both the primary and secondary levels have become overloaded. In an attempt to&#13;
respond to demands for more diversified courses, particularly in the technical and vocational areas, subjects&#13;
have been added in an ad hoc manner, without adequate attention to their cost implications or the integrity&#13;
of the whole curriculum. Ad hoc decisions of MOE also have adverse effects on the efficiency of the&#13;
Curriculum Unit. The Science curriculum specialist is saddled with responsibility for Family Life, Aids&#13;
Prevention, Health Education and so on, as such subjects are added to the curriculum as separate subjects&#13;
rather than as integral parts of the relevant syllabi. New initiatives such as music, art and agriculture&#13;
distort the emphasis that is due to developing the core subjects. As a result, primary schools are&#13;
insufficiently focused on the basic, core subjects and secondary schools sometimes offer uneconomical&#13;
course options to students, with small average class sizes in such subject areas. A review of the&#13;
organization of the secondary school in terms of the efficient arrangement of the curriculum, deployment of&#13;
staff and use of facilities is needed to ensure that appropriate measures are adopted to place the reform&#13;
effort on a financially sustainable basis. The curricula need to be coordinated as between levels--primary&#13;
9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and secondary--and to be consolidated to avoid the tendency toward proliferation of subjects and the&#13;
consequent high cost of too fragmented a curriculum, especially at the secondary level.&#13;
3.17   (ii) Instructional Materials:    The Ministry has a standardized list of approved school books.&#13;
These are produced by the major British and some Caribbean publishers. The cost of books is met by the&#13;
parents who are stated to be generally unable to supply all the required books. In regard to preparing and&#13;
producing curriculum guides and teaching materials to assist teachers, the Curriculum Unit has serious&#13;
constraints of staff, equipment and supplies. Moreover, no officer is trained in textbook or reading&#13;
materials production. Supplementary reading materials and various forms of teaching apparatus are&#13;
urgently needed to support teachers in the early grades if standards of student and teacher performance are&#13;
to be raised. Expert review in other OECS countries suggests that it would be feasible to establish a&#13;
nucleus of a unit for preparing and producing such materials to supplement what can be purchased in the&#13;
stores, to determine Government's procurement policy on such materials and to contribute to any sub-&#13;
regional effort in production of such materials, especially at the primary level.&#13;
3.18   Beyond simply reading materials, the teachers also require to be supported by regular provision of&#13;
instructional equipment, materials and supplies. The supply of these items is extremely limited at present.&#13;
Basic materials for teaching mathematics, science and social studies are absent and teachers are not&#13;
supplied with the basic textbooks and often have to purchase them for their teaching functions. Thus, the&#13;
impoverished state of the schools reduces the chances of efficient teaching and learning.&#13;
3.19   To fulfill its significant potential to improve curricula and the availability of supportive educational&#13;
materials, particularly at the primary level, and thus contribute to desired improvements in the quality of&#13;
education, MOE requires: (i) upgrading, as well as a modest expansion of its technical staff, with special&#13;
attention to building institutional capacity in educational materials preparation and production, including&#13;
editing and publishing, the latter of which will assist the Ministry to become more market-wise in its&#13;
contracting processes; (ii) furniture, equipment and supplies to permit it to undertake desk top publishing,&#13;
as appropriate, as well as advance the publishing readiness of material it produces, thereby reducing costs&#13;
of extemal publication and manufacturing; (iii) improved methods of selection of secondary textbooks.&#13;
3.20   (iii) Testing and Measurement. The Ministry plans of developing standardized tests. The CEE is&#13;
designed in Grenada but scored in Barbados by the Caribbean Examinations Council (CXC) because of the&#13;
lack of the necessary computer facilities in Grenada. The need exists for a professionally designed testing&#13;
system that facilitates the development of norms and standards over the basic cycle (Grades 1-9, i.e., up to&#13;
Form 3 of the secondary school). Such a system would need to test students within the primary and&#13;
secondary cycles rather than only at the end of each cycle, thus enabling problems of learning and teaching&#13;
to be diagnosed in time for corrective measures to be taken and to inform efforts in teacher training and&#13;
guidance, curriculum design, materials preparation, school supervision and testing itself. It would also&#13;
facilitate research into the scale and nature of such problems as the wide gender disparities in the CEE and&#13;
CXC performances.&#13;
3.21   The administration of external examinations also needs to be strengthened, especially with the&#13;
recent increase in work resulting from the change in the CXC examination to a more school-based mode.&#13;
The needs include adequate office and storage space, office equipment, computers and transport facilities.&#13;
3.22   State of Physical Plant. As the school mapping survey concluded, the current state of much of the&#13;
physical plant in schools is not conducive to adequate teaching or learning. A thorough study of the state&#13;
of school plant is underway and on the basis of the findings, a program of renovation, repair and&#13;
rehabilitation will be drawn up. Many primary schools were constructed for non-school purposes, some&#13;
10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
were constructed with unsuitable materials, some have been inadequately protected from the ravages of&#13;
weather, ternites and normal wear and tear and others are simply unsafe. There has been minimal&#13;
attention to repair of facilities over the past decade. On the basis of the findings of the on-going survey, a&#13;
program of rehabilitation will be prepared that will be phased over the project implementation period. The&#13;
study has also proposed prototype school building designs that would, inter alia, help to minimize the&#13;
maintenance problem.&#13;
3.23   The current schools maintenance unit, transferred from the Ministry of Works to MOE in the&#13;
1980s is inadequately funded. This unit attempts to repair Government (and some Assisted) schools, using&#13;
a permanent staff of 12 of its own skilled construction workers, hiring daily paid workers at the community&#13;
level and entering into contracts with small contractors. What is urgently needed is some method of&#13;
ensuring the allocation of a due proportion of the sector resources to maintenance purposes, along with the&#13;
most efficient use of these resources.&#13;
3.24   Beyond pervasive disrepair, the configuration of many schools--often the open hall type--does not&#13;
facilitate normal teaching, let alone adoption of innovative approaches, such as team or group teaching.&#13;
Staff rooms, where they exist, are cramped, serving far more teachers than their original design envisaged.&#13;
Classroom separation only by movable blackboards results in high levels of noise and distraction for&#13;
students and teachers. Generally, the primary schools are short of libraries and staff rooms, their toilets are&#13;
often in a state of disrepair and few are properly fenced.&#13;
(2) Efficiency of the Educational System&#13;
3.25   The current actual average teacher to student ratios for public schools are 1:27 at the primary&#13;
level and 1: 19 at the secondary level. These averages cover a range among the primary schools of between&#13;
1:8 and 1:35 (1994), and among secondary schools of between 1:12.3 and 1:24.4. Attthe primary level, the&#13;
ratio exceeds the reasonable level of 1:30-35, as well as the official standard of 1:35 for a qualified teacher&#13;
and 1:25 for an untrained teacher. At the secondary level, a ratio of 1:25 would be more appropriate in&#13;
schools without a sixth Form. Extensive research has shown that, except at the extremes, lower teacher to&#13;
student ratios do not adversely affect either the quality of education provided or the levels of learning and&#13;
achievement.&#13;
3.26   The relatively high current ratios reflect the absence of close monitoring of costs and efficiency,&#13;
and lack of cost-conscious detailed planning and programniing in relation to how curricula are organized at&#13;
the school level and how the teachers are recruited and deployed. At the primary level, there will be a&#13;
continuing decline in enrollments over the next few years, as well as geographical shifts in population and,&#13;
at secondary level, some increase in enrollments and a better distribution of places around the country.&#13;
Thus, three major changes are indicated--(i) the consolidation of curricula especially at secondary levels to&#13;
optimize the use of teaching staff, (ii) rationalization of teaching resources which should include adjusting&#13;
teacher-to-student ratios to more economical levels and may include transferring some teachers from&#13;
primary to secondary schools, reducing the rate of recruitment of new teachers and adopting new strategies&#13;
for teacher training, aimed at attaining a 100 percent trained service, and (iii) equalizing the level of&#13;
staffing for individual schools with due attention to the special needs of small schools.&#13;
3.27   The Appendix to Annex 3 sets out the implications of adjusting teacher-to-student ratios at&#13;
primary and secondary levels. Without a firm policy with respect to ensuring that school expenditure is&#13;
balanced as between salary and non-salary expenditures, the yield from the educational investments has&#13;
11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
steadily declined. The high proportion of the recurrent education budget which is expended to meet salary&#13;
and other personal emoluments (representing over 95 percent of recurrent allocations to primary and&#13;
secondary schools in the 1995 Estimates) seriously constrains resource availability for other key&#13;
educational inputs, particularly improved management, educational equipment and supplies, and the&#13;
maintenance of school plant and equipment. This proportion needs to be brought down to a more&#13;
reasonable level of less than 90 percent to produce a more efficient mix of resources for effective teaching.&#13;
3.28   The implications of not effecting these changes to the ratios are serious. Qualitative and&#13;
institutional improvements such as those to be supported under the Basic Education Reform Project will&#13;
require to be financed by new resources. The Government will therefore have to raise the education sector&#13;
share of the national budget by EC$2.0+ million--equivalent to eight percent of the total primary and&#13;
secondary school budget or six percent of the sector budget or one percent of the national recurrent budget.&#13;
Such a change is highly unfeasible given the current major fiscal constraints. It would be equally unwise to&#13;
attempt such changes in ratios without a concomitant improvement in the services received by teachers&#13;
from head office and in the situation regarding supplies and maintenance at the school level.&#13;
(3) Equity of Access to Educational Opportunities&#13;
3.29   Such gender inequalities in access to education as exist in Grenada, as elsewhere in the OECS,&#13;
result not from any laws or regulations but from the gender disparities in student achievement, commencing&#13;
at the primary level, with girls outperforming boys. Girls comprised 59.3% of public secondary enrollment&#13;
in 19946. Neither the underlying causes nor the long term consequences of this phenomenon are known, but&#13;
to the extent that it represents some form of under performance on the part of boys, it warrants carefu&#13;
study, along with a study of the overall unsatisfactory perfonnance of students generally.&#13;
3.30   Further, the poorer families face special geographic constraints to access to good quality education.&#13;
The heavy urban, particularly St. George's, concentration of secondary schools works to the disadvantage&#13;
of poor, rural families. At the same time, the unsatisfactory CEE performance of many students attending&#13;
the weaker primary schools restricts their access to secondary education, which is becoming increasingly&#13;
important for effective labor force entry.&#13;
3.31   While public education is provided free, with no tuition fee, other annual education-related&#13;
expenditures which must be borne by the household are considerable. These include: uniforms and school&#13;
bus transport, which can average over US$300 equivalent per student per academic year (or about 12&#13;
percent of per capita GNP); textbooks and other educational materials the outlays for which have been&#13;
estimated to range from around US$80 per student at the primary level to US$250 equivalent at the&#13;
secondary level; and any other charges levied at the school level. With regard to textbooks, the high&#13;
average costs are attributable largely to two factors: (a) the large number of textbooks required per subject,&#13;
with overlap in material estimated to quite considerable; and (b) inefficiencies in procedures used for&#13;
procuring textbooks and other educational materials, which results in prices exceeding international market&#13;
prices.&#13;
6'his imbalance is not new. Girls have outnumbered boys in Grenadian secondary enrollments since 1970&#13;
(which is as far back as the statistics go), and over the years the gap has simply widened.&#13;
12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B. Government Sectoral Policy and Financing&#13;
3.32 Education Policy. National development policy for the education sector has been quite clearly&#13;
elaborated in various documents. The Ministry of Finance statement in May 19947 emphasizes provision&#13;
of skills to the work force, improving access to, and quality of, secondary education, devoting a larger&#13;
share of resources to basic education and, under the proposed project, developing curricula, upgrading&#13;
facilities and strengthening teacher training. A parallel Paper by the Ministry of Education' outlines the&#13;
specific priorities as follows:&#13;
* developing local capacity for research;&#13;
* institutional development (including developing local capacity for policy analysis, review and&#13;
formulation, sector analysis, identifying, preparing, monitoring, and evaluating programs and&#13;
projects and collecting data and generating information);&#13;
* reform of the education and training system, including:&#13;
-- reducing inequalities in access to educational opportunities caused by geography and&#13;
economic circumstances, with special attention to children in remote mral areas;&#13;
-- improvement in internal and external efficiency (reduced student attrition and improved&#13;
relationship between curricula and the job market);&#13;
* expanding access to education and designing and applying more appropriate curricula;&#13;
* provision of learning materials and nutritional support; and&#13;
* promoting educational quality, including the relevance of curricula to preparing students for&#13;
higher levels and the job market.&#13;
3.33   The programs and projects envisaged include technical assistance for school mapping and a sector&#13;
survey, training in planning, sector analysis and statistics, better equipping of management and&#13;
reorganizing of the management structure. Finally, a draft education plan has been prepared by MOE but&#13;
has not been adopted by Government. However, this plan was not based on systematic sector analysis.&#13;
3.34   The current weaknesses in the administration suggest the need to increase the number of senior&#13;
level staff, to establish a planning function and a project implementation capacity and to add the role of&#13;
internal audit and financial analysis. Discrete separate units are advisable for (i) developing and&#13;
supervising curricula, (ii) testing and measurement and (iii) educational materials, as the expertise required&#13;
in each of these three areas, despite their common threads, is quite unique. Overall, considerable training in&#13;
all of these fields is needed. The existing structure as well as the proposed changes being considered are&#13;
shown in Annex 2, Chart 2 and Annex 3, Chart I respectively.&#13;
3.35   Sector Financing. Annual recurrent sector outlays prior to the structural adjustment program&#13;
amounted to 18-19% of the national recurrent budget9. The present level of 16.6% represents some decline&#13;
in the share; however, in the current fiscal circumstances, the likelihood of any large increase is slim. What&#13;

3.37   In the absence of a proper Plan for the sector, it is impossible to forecast the evolution of this intra-&#13;
sectoral distribution which, in view of the volatile demographic patterns, will be subject to important&#13;
changes as the system develops.&#13;
3.38    Modest variations exist in the per student recurrent expenditure by level of education. Public&#13;
expenditure per student for 1995 is expected to be roughly EC$700 (US$260) at primary, EC$1,093&#13;
(US$400) at secondary and EC$3,958 (US$1,466) at TAMCC (which includes traditional secondary&#13;
Grades 12 and 13).&#13;
3.39    Capital investment in the Education Sector has been heavily externally financed over the period&#13;
1992-1995, principally by the World Food Program and by the Bank and CDB (Cr. 1785-CRG), and has&#13;
constituted around seven percent of the Government's capital budget, which is consistent with the OECS&#13;
regional average. (Annex 3).&#13;
14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4. SECTORAL ASSISTANCE STRATEGY&#13;
A. The Bank's Role and Strategy&#13;
4.1   The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the OERCS countries, including Grenada (Report No.&#13;
14295-LAC dated April 10, 1995), falls within the parameters of the Strategy for the OECS as a whole.&#13;
The Bank strategy involves (a) reliance on the coordinating role of the Caribbean group for Cooperation in&#13;
Economic Development (CGCED) and close links to CDB and, (b) economic and sector work and financial&#13;
assistance to support country priorities. In recognition of the small size of the economies, the World Bank&#13;
Group provides its lending on a 50/50 IDA/lBRD blend. The Bank remains a strong supporter of country&#13;
efforts at economic diversification, developing the private sector and strengthening the analytical capacities&#13;
of the public sector and refocusing its role. The support of human resource development, infrastructure&#13;
development, natural resource management, and environmental protection are seen as essential to the&#13;
process of economic diversification toward such areas as tourism, high value agriculture products and new&#13;
export services, which offer some opportunity to alleviate unemployment and poverty.&#13;
4.2    The proposed project fully supports the CAS targeting the priority area of human resource&#13;
development, catalyzing an education sector adjustment process to improve efficiency of public resource&#13;
use and promoting reform that is consistent with the reforms being adopted elsewhere in the OECS sub-&#13;
region. Following the experience in St. Lucia, where the Bank and CDB worked closely from project&#13;
preparation through planned implementation and supervision, the subsequent phase of the OECS program&#13;
will be carried out in the same cooperative way, but with CDB concentrating on St. Kitts &amp; Nevis and St.&#13;
Vincent and the Grenadines, while the Bank focuses on Dominica and Grenada.&#13;
4.3    To further promote regional collaboration, project preparatory work has drawn principally on&#13;
Caribbean technical expertise. The use of a common core of consultants across the OECS countries has&#13;
promoted exchange of ideas among countries. Moreover, such project preparation has been carried out in&#13;
close consultation with the OECS Secretariat, building on its extensive work to formulate and promote&#13;
rapid implementation of an OECS Education Reform Strategy (OERS), to which the OECS Governments&#13;
are committed. The project emphasis on sector planning and institutional development, qualitative&#13;
improvement of basic education, and expansion of access to secondary education reflects the priority&#13;
actions identified in the OERS.&#13;
4.4    The OERS envisages activities at both national and regional levels. Unexpected delays have&#13;
occurred in establishment of the regional machinery, however, at their meeting in Montserrat in November&#13;
1993, the OECS Ministers of Education agreed that the national govermments should proceed with their&#13;
own urgently needed education investment programs, consistent with the Reform objectives. This proposed&#13;
project is in keeping with that decision and consistent with priority sector development needs identified in&#13;
the Bank report, "Access, Quality and Efficiency in Caribbean Education: A Regional Study," prepared at&#13;
the request of member govermments discussed widely in the region, and formally presented at the June 1992&#13;
CGCED meeting. That meeting also requested direct Bank technical and financial support to accelerate&#13;
human resource development in this region.&#13;
15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B. Bank Sector Experience and Lessons Learned&#13;
4.5   The Bank has had limited sector experience in Grenada. The IDA-financed OECS Regional&#13;
Vocational and Technical Education Project, Credit 1785-CRG, in the amount of SDR 4.8 rnillion (US$&#13;
6.5 million equivalent) with a total project cost of US$ 13.5 million equivalent, was co-financed by the&#13;
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and CDB. The Credit was approved by the Board in 1987,&#13;
and became effective in 1987, and the Credit Account was closed on June 30, 1994. While national&#13;
coordinators were appointed by each of the five participating OECS Governnents, CDB served as project&#13;
executing agency. As a result, the OECS Governments, including Grenada, did not gain direct experience&#13;
with Bank-financed project execution, procurement, disbursement, and other procedures. The Bank has&#13;
also been involved in the recently approved lending to education in St. Lucia, Loan 3837-SLU and Credit&#13;
2676-SLU (for the Basic Education Reform Project) which were approved in January 1995.&#13;
4.6    An Implementation Completion Report (ICR)'0 has been prepared for the Regional Vocational and&#13;
Technical Education Project. It is clearly too early to assess fully the impact of the investment. Review to&#13;
date indicates that the overall performance of the project was mixed. Notable achievements include a&#13;
substantial increase in technical and vocational education capacity in the participating countries. Project&#13;
investments also led to extensive overseas training of technical and vocational teachers for the respective&#13;
education systems. The pre-vocational curricula developed under project auspices, though developed only&#13;
for the first year of study and introduced too late during the project implementation to be fully evaluated,&#13;
hold promise of providing, with possible adjustments, a solid orientation to technical fields.&#13;
4.7    Notwithstanding actual and potential contributions, the project also experienced significant&#13;
problems. Many of the civil works experienced substantial delays in start-up and completion of&#13;
construction, leading to price increases and creating the need for long-term storage of equipment and&#13;
furniture delivered according to the original implementation schedule. The new and rehabilitated facilities&#13;
were also not well maintained. The quality and quantity of procured instructional equipment were a&#13;
problem and there was insufficient attention to its commissioning and utilization. Many of the problems&#13;
relating to safety and security of equipment and civil works ultimately were successfully addressed by&#13;
means of an Action Plan designed and implemented by the Bank and CDB. Shortfalls in execution of other&#13;
major project activities nevertheless hampered the full achievement of project objectives. For example, the&#13;
project laid the groundwork for labor market information systems to provide needed links and information&#13;
flows between technical/vocational training and the labor market; and three countries produced labor&#13;
bulletins. However, the lack of direct project financing for this, as well as other institutional development&#13;
aspects, coupled with shortages of staff at the country-level, hampered actual establishment of the planned&#13;
systems, and the conduct of the annual labor surveys on which they depend. Weak consultant reports, and&#13;
insufficient Government commitment or incentives, led to abandonment of envisaged cost recovery and&#13;
savings measures intended to ensure program sustainability. Attempts were made to establish the&#13;
envisaged Regional Training Board that was intended to coordinate technical/vocational programs across&#13;
the OECS, building on experience gained by the project in establishing National Boards. A few regional&#13;
meetings were held; however, with insufficient commitment to such a Board, and insufficient project&#13;
resources to build the requisite policy constituency, the results were less than was anticipated.&#13;

4.8    Lessons Learned. Review of the relevant completion and audit reports of this OECS project, as&#13;
well as of education projects in Jamaica (Second and Third Education Projects, respectively Loan 727-JM&#13;
and Loan 2070-JM), Barbados (First Education and Training Project, Loan 1642-BAR), and Haiti (Third&#13;
Education Project, Credit 1305-HA) reveals that it is essential to: (a) link project objectives to the broader&#13;
sector and macro policy objectives to enhance overall commitment to, and hence success in execution of,&#13;
the project; (b) carefully evaluate local procurement and project implementation capacities to ensure that&#13;
adequate and timely institutional support is available for the smooth operation of the project; (c) ensure on&#13;
an annual basis that Govermment budgets provide the requisite project financing so that the planned pace&#13;
and breadth of project activities can be sustained, and the project completed according to schedule; (d)&#13;
involve all major concerned parties in an education reform process (i.e., the Ministry staff, principals,&#13;
teachers and teachers unions, and parents and community groups) from the early stages of project design;&#13;
and (e) ensure that the policy environment within which the project will operate is supportive of project&#13;
objectives and facilitates the needed systemic and institutional reforms.&#13;
4.9    These lessons have been taken into account in the design of this project. The project objectives are&#13;
drawn from the MOE Framework Paper of May 1994, the Grenada Provisional Education Plan,&#13;
recommendations of the OECS Education Reform Strategy Paper which was endorsed by all OECS&#13;
member Governments, and the Bank's report "Access, Quality and Efficiency in Caribbean Education: A&#13;
Regional Study" which was discussed with all Caribbean governments. The objectives are also consistent&#13;
with the CDB Human Resource Development Sector Policy Paper of November 1993.&#13;
4.10   Preparatory work was undertaken, under a program of comparative studies relative to the sector&#13;
situation in St. Lucia which is to the benefit of both countries. These studies were financed by a Japanese&#13;
P'HRD Grant to St. Lucia. These studies included a review of teacher training and a school location&#13;
planning exercise. A survey of schools and their rehabilitation needs has been undertaken which&#13;
concentrates on the schools identified by the school location planning exercise as deficient. Another study&#13;
is being conducted in secondary school organization (Annex 4-Preparatory Studies).&#13;
4.11   The preparatory phase has included consultation with all major entities in the sector, including the&#13;
management and staff of MOE, the teacher training department of TAMCC, Ministry of Works, private&#13;
sector employers and the Grenada Union of Teachers. The MOE and Ministry of Finance maintained frank&#13;
and open dialogue on investment, policy and institutional reform requirements as well as facilitating the&#13;
access of the Bank missions to persons and materials. As civil works represent some of 63 percent of total&#13;
project cost, attention was given in the project preparatory phase to developing prototype designs which&#13;
take into account local building standards and experiences, and environmental (including climatic) and&#13;
other factors. Emphasis also was placed on preparation of preliminary drawings for all facilities that&#13;
would be financed under the project by a respected international architectural firm familiar with the Bank.&#13;
This was intended to preclude the significant civil works problems encountered under the earlier Vocational&#13;
and Technical Education Project in which excessive reliance was placed on the local Ministries of Public&#13;
Works, which proved to have limited institutional capacity to guide this process. The selection and&#13;
methods for procurement of educational equipment and furniture have been carefully assessed to ensure&#13;
that detailed technical specifications are developed with participation of end users, high quality-low cost&#13;
sources are identified and tapped, and comprehensive plans exist for operationalizing and pilot testing new&#13;
equipment, and training teachers in their appropriate use. All these measures should considerably reduce&#13;
the risk of repeating the serious problems in these areas encountered in the earlier OECS education project.&#13;
17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives and Concept&#13;
5.1    The proposed Basic Education Reform Project responds to a request from the Government of&#13;
Grenada to assist it in its efforts to reform its education system. The decision to focus on the basic&#13;
education cycle (Grades 1-9) arose out of regional discussions over the period 1992-93 (para 4.9).&#13;
Agreement on the scope of a possible project were reached in the course of dialogue in 1995 among&#13;
Govermment, Bank and CDB staff. The actual project content was elaborated over the period February-&#13;
October 1995 in discussions between the Government and the Bank.&#13;
5.2    The overall project goal is to accelerate human resource development so that the requisite&#13;
manpower can be produced to support the desired national economic transition. The project represents the&#13;
first stage of a major reform of basic education, aimed at improved efficiency and effectiveness of the&#13;
education system and at enhancing the quality of, and equity of access to, basic education. Thus, the&#13;
project objectives are to (a) strengthen the planning and institutional capacity of the MOE to guide and&#13;
carry out the long-term development of the sector, while enabling it to initiate urgent measures to address&#13;
system-wide qualitative problems and expansion needs at the primary and secondary levels, and (b) serve&#13;
as a catalyst for a major adjustment process, focused on moving toward more reasonable primary and&#13;
secondary teacher to student ratios, in line with ratios of countries in similar economic and social&#13;
circumstances. Such adjustment is critical to ensure that already relatively high levels of resource&#13;
allocations to public education respond more effectively to current and projected needs, including increased&#13;
financing for system management and planning, more instructional equipment and supplies and proper&#13;
maintenance of school facilities--all of which are now significantly underfinanced. The planned adjustment&#13;
is crucial to ensure the financial sustainability of the reform initiatives being launched. An analysis of the&#13;
possible phasing and impact of this adjustment process is provided in Annex 3, Appendix. The specific&#13;
project objectives are threefold:&#13;
(i)   to strengthen management in the sector, as well as educational planning and&#13;
central planning, particularly in the social sectors.&#13;
(ii)   to improve the quality of basic education, and&#13;
(iii)   to expand access to secondary education and rehabilitate primary and secondary&#13;
school facilities.&#13;
5.3    The project is based on the Government's sector development policy. At Loan/Credit Negotiations,&#13;
agreement will be reached on the content of an Education Strategy Letter from the Government to IBRD&#13;
and 1DA that would:&#13;
(a)    outline the Ministry's strategy for strengthening the management and planning of the&#13;
sector, including&#13;
(i)   reorganization of the structure of the Ministry&#13;
(ii)   the schedule of establishing new units and reinforcing existing units with agreed&#13;
functions and responsibilities&#13;
(iii)    accelerated action on the Educational Planning Unit (EPU) and the Project&#13;
Management Unit (PMU) to create and staff them with professionals with agreed&#13;
qualifications;&#13;
18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(b)   indicate the government's plans and programs with respect to the adjustmnent of teacher to&#13;
student ratios and to adjust the ratio of allocations in the schools as between salary and&#13;
non salary expenditures in parallel with to strengthening of management and improvernent&#13;
in the provision of instructional supplies and maintenance services to schools. (Paras 3.26&#13;
to 3.28):&#13;
(c)    elaborate the parallel policies and actions that the Ministry would adopt to give full effect&#13;
to the reform including, inter alia:&#13;
(i)    policies on raising the standards for recruitment into the teaching profession and&#13;
the teacher training programs, and the incorporation of these new standards into&#13;
the Education law (Act and Regulations) being prepared;&#13;
(ii)   the strengthening of technical services to schools with a view to improving the&#13;
quality and efficiency of the education provided, such services to include&#13;
educational testing and measurement, curriculum supervision, educational&#13;
materials and improved supervisions services for support and guidance of&#13;
teachers;&#13;
(iii)   the conduct and utilization of studies financed under the project;&#13;
(iv)   the guarantee of public ownership of, and access to, any public school constructed&#13;
under the project on church lands;&#13;
(v)    ensuring greater equity in the provision of secondary education over the country as&#13;
a whole;&#13;
(vi)   the revision of the classification and compensation of teachers so as to encourage&#13;
the pursuit of advanced (or post graduate) training by rewarding those who have&#13;
successfully pursued such training; and&#13;
(vii)    ensuring that by September 1998 at least the full time equivalent of 12 tutors are&#13;
allocated to the Teacher Education Department of TAMCC from the overall staff&#13;
Establishment provided for TAMCC.&#13;
B. Detailed Project Description&#13;
5.4    The project comprises three major components:&#13;
(a)    Strensthening Management and Planninz. This component would:&#13;
* help to reorganize the managernent of the school system, upgrade staff, and improve&#13;
coordination among key MOE operating units;&#13;
* build capacity in sector planning and analysis and formulate a long-term sector&#13;
development plan;&#13;
* strengthen central planning so that it could better assist and support educational&#13;
planning;&#13;
* develop an integrated education data system comprising student, school, financial and&#13;
personnel information to facilitate improved sector analysis, administration and&#13;
management and policy making;&#13;
* establish a permanent project development and management capacity within the MOE;&#13;
including increased capacity in procuring school supplies and maintenance of physical&#13;
plant;&#13;
* strengthen financial management; and&#13;
19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
* finance special studies to assist in fonnulating future policy and program developments;&#13;
(b)    Improving the Quality of Basic Education. This component would enhance the quality of&#13;
teaching and learning, through upgrading basic teacher training and strengthening in-&#13;
service training for teachers (with special attention to science, mathematics and language&#13;
arts) and, concurrently, ensuring their more appropriate utilization and productivity of&#13;
teachers through improved supervision and management; a better supply of instructional&#13;
materials, improved curricula (especially in core subjects); establishing an educational&#13;
testing and measurement capacity to monitor student and system performance; and&#13;
building capacity in cost-effective methods of preparing, selecting, producing, procuring&#13;
and distributing educational materials;&#13;
(c)    Expansion ofAccess to Schools. This component would (i) increase secondary places in&#13;
the most under-served districts to reduce overcrowding and long distance travel and&#13;
facilitate access to educational opportunities, (ii) replace primary schools that are now&#13;
housed in unsatisfactory buildings and (iii) provide funding for urgently needed&#13;
rehabilitation of selected schools.&#13;
Strengthening Management and Planning Component&#13;
(US$1.7 million equivalent, or 19 percent of total base costs).&#13;
5.5    MOE needs to pursue its review of its organization, procedures and functions with a view to&#13;
rationalizing the use of existing human and financial resources and improving its overall efficiency in&#13;
guiding the education system. As an urgent, interim measure to facilitate improved education planning and&#13;
directly support project implementation, MOE would reorganize its educational planning and development&#13;
functions under an Educational Planning and Development Section. The new section will comprise two&#13;
units--an Education Planning and Statistics Unit (EPU) and a Project Management Unit (PMU). The&#13;
proposed new organizational structure of the MOE is illustrated in Annex 3, Chart 1&#13;
5.6    Senior Management.  In order to assist the MOE to better rationalize and utilize sector&#13;
resources, to identify ways of modernizing education system administration consistent with the evolution of&#13;
the sector, including revision, as appropriate, of its laws and regulations, and to incorporate these strategies&#13;
in the long term sector development plan, the project would provide:&#13;
(a)    Expert services (6 months) to assist the MOE management in refining and implementing&#13;
reforms, as needed, in its organizational structure and administrative procedures;&#13;
(b)    Study tours (4 months) for two senior staff to review education reforrn processes in other&#13;
countries and attend relevant seminars and courses in such areas as effective schools and&#13;
education policy analysis;&#13;
(c)    Civil works for office space", and&#13;
(d)    Office equipment and supplies, and literature and reference material for professional&#13;
updating on educational developments worldwide."'&#13;
Office space is included to accommodate the entire head office of MOE, including new units. Office space for&#13;
the various units is detailed in Annex 5. Table 1.&#13;
20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5.7    Financial Management. To assist in orienting management of the sector toward grater emphasis on&#13;
efficiency and to provide continuing analysis of cost effectiveness, budget formats and productivity on a&#13;
regular basis throughout the Education system, and advising the Ministry on improving its efficiency&#13;
generally, a financial analyst would be employed. The analyst would also serve an internal audit function&#13;
within MOE and train staff in accounting, budgeting and expenditure control and the use of computers in&#13;
financial management. The project would finance:&#13;
(a)    one fellowship (1 staff year) for one-year of advanced training in financial management&#13;
and analysis and in efficiency studies and the use of computers in budgeting, expenditure&#13;
control and accounting; and&#13;
(b)    related office furniture, equipment and supplies.&#13;
5.8    Planning.     To meet the challenges presented by the education reform process, facilitate&#13;
introduction of timely adjustments to the system, and foster closer interaction of education systems across&#13;
the OECS, the project would assist in establishing the Educational Planning &amp; Statistics Unit (EPU) of&#13;
MOE, one of the first tasks of which would be preparation of a long-term sector development plan for the&#13;
period 1996-2005. This Plan would serve as the franework for capital investments in the sector.&#13;
5.9    The EPU would include Statistics not merely as an adjunct to planning, but as a service to the&#13;
sector as well and as an integral part of the planning process. The project would assist in launching the&#13;
first phase of development of an integrated education data system to collect, collate, analyze and&#13;
disseminate statistical information on the sector and assist other units of MOE in investigation and&#13;
research. A computerized data base would be instituted (including information on students, teachers, and&#13;
schools as well as financial records and expenditures and non-confidential personnel records) to support&#13;
improved management, policy making and research. The data collection and analysis systems to be adopted&#13;
would respond to MOE management needs, including necessary linkages to other data systems at the&#13;
national level. The data system would be compatible with the planned OECS education reporting system,&#13;
thus facilitating exchange of information between and among OECS member countries. For the support of&#13;
the education sector planning efforts, the Planning Division in the Ministry of Finance would also be&#13;
strengthened.&#13;
5.10   To these ends, the project would finance:&#13;
(a)    Fellowships (4 staff years) for four persons to pursue one-year advanced training&#13;
programs, one in educational planning one in statistics, one in economic planning and one&#13;
in social sector planning; each of the first two would also have a short overseas attachment&#13;
to an appropriate planning unit.&#13;
(b)    (i) Expert services of six months' duration, concentrated in the first two years of project&#13;
implementation, to assist the EPU to identify and analyze key sub-sectoral and sectoral&#13;
issues, establish approaches to long range planning and lay the groundwork for the long-&#13;
tern sector plan, and&#13;
12 Relevant literature and reading materials needed for all institutional strengthening and quality improvement&#13;
components are included under this area of project support. These materials would be centrally managed for&#13;
optimal organizing and accessibility.&#13;
21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(ii) Expert services of four months' duration concentrated in the second year of&#13;
implementation to assist the Planning Division in economic planning generally and in&#13;
improving links between central and sector planning&#13;
(c)    Related office furniture, equipment and supplies, computers and related software and&#13;
printers, and equipment maintenance; and&#13;
(d)    Local training'3, through a series of workshops on education planning principles and use&#13;
and collection of statistics for (i) school supervisory staff and selected principals to&#13;
facilitate their understanding, participation and cooperation in the planning process and (ii)&#13;
principals and other staff at the school level with the same aim.&#13;
(e)    Select planning and policy-related studies'4 and surveys, to be carried out under the overall&#13;
coordination of the EPU, in association with other relevant units of MOE and the&#13;
Government generally, including:&#13;
educational costs and financing; school location in relation to population distribution;&#13;
education and training implications of economic and social development and labor market&#13;
demands (including the relationship of primary and secondary curricular trends to the&#13;
requirements of tertiary education and the labor market); teacher effectiveness, impact of&#13;
teacher training, teacher attrition; impact analysis of the school supervision and teacher&#13;
performance assessment systems; longitudinal studies of students, studies of learning,&#13;
performance disparities by school, gender etc.; the impact of reading materials on student&#13;
achievement; effectiveness of school maintenance strategies; preparatory studies relating to&#13;
a possible follow-on project and other studies.&#13;
Tlhe intention of MOE to carry out the agreed project-supported planning and policy-related studies would&#13;
be indicated in the Education Strategy Letter.&#13;
5.11   Proiect Management and Development. The PMU would be established as a permanent entity&#13;
within the MOE and will be responsible for (I) coordination of project implementation; (2) project&#13;
monitoring and evaluation; (3) preparation of the requisite six monthly and mid-term project reports; and&#13;
(4) implementation of the MOE development program. The PMU will incorporate the existing units&#13;
responsible for (i) maintenance of school facilities and (ii) the procurement and distribution of school&#13;
furniture, equipment, materials and supplies. The PMU would be headed by a full-time Project Manager,&#13;
assisted by a full-time Procurement Officer to oversee procurement, and a full-time accountant to manage&#13;
project accounts, and other support staff. To the extent possible, administrative and operating procedures&#13;
to be adopted by the PMU for execution of the Basic Education Reform Project would become the modus&#13;
operandi of the MOE in general maintenance operations and procurement of stores and supplies.&#13;
5.12   To support project management objectives, the project would finance:&#13;
(a)    Five (5) months of study tours for key PMU staff (manager, procurement officer,&#13;
accountant) to gain experience and skills in areas relevant to their responsibilities in the&#13;
13 In general, where local training is to be financed, eligible expenditures would include fees or honoraria for&#13;
trainers, travel and any necessary per diem allowances, costs of preparing, producing and procuring training&#13;
materials and transport costs.&#13;
4 For studies conducted under the project, eligible expenditures would include costs of consulting services,&#13;
travel and transport, necessary materials and supplies and expenses of producing (typing and printing) reports.&#13;
22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Unit, such as review of operations of Education Project Management Units elsewhere in&#13;
the Caribbean (e.g. Barbados, Jamaica and Trinidad &amp; Tobago), and/or to attend World&#13;
Bank or CDB seminars on topics such as disbursements, accounting, procurement, etc.,&#13;
and for short-term attachment of the Procurement Officer to a suitable procurement agency&#13;
for training purposes;&#13;
(b)    Expert services (10 months) to include: eight months of services of a Project Management&#13;
Expert to assist in project coordination and in setting up the PMU and establishing its&#13;
procedures; and two months of services of a Procurement Expert to assist the PMU team&#13;
at critical points in the procurement process;&#13;
(c)    Related furniture, equipment and supplies, including computers, related software, printers,&#13;
photocopier, etc., and two vans, one for the maintenance service and one for the&#13;
distribution of instructional materials and supplies, and&#13;
(d)    Studies of project evaluation, including the preparation of the Implementation Completion&#13;
Report and studies of efficiency in the maintenance of school buildings, and the&#13;
procurement and distribution of school supplies.&#13;
Qualitative Improvement of Basic Education Component (US$ 2.2 million equivalent, or 26 percent of&#13;
total base costs)&#13;
5.13   The project assigns high priority to improving the quality of primary education, particularly in the&#13;
core subject areas. This component, encompassing improvement of major educational inputs, is expected&#13;
to lay the foundation for building permanent institutional capacity to promote quality improvement in a&#13;
coordinated way and to monitor and diagnose problems in regard to educational quality.&#13;
5.14   Substantial improvements in examination performance are expected to accrue within the medium&#13;
term from the quality-oriented project investments at the primary and secondary levels.&#13;
5.15   To contribute to enhanced educational quality objectives, as well as provide a basis for the more&#13;
effective participation of Grenada in the OECS Education Reform Strategy initiative, the project will&#13;
support five closely integrated and inter-dependent areas--(l) teacher training, (2) school supervision, (3)&#13;
curriculum development, (4) educational materials and (5) educational testing and measurement.&#13;
5.16   Teacher Training.    This sub-component seeks to improve teacher training at the basic and in-&#13;
service levels and, thus, contribute to improved teaching (and ultimately learning) and to expand the&#13;
number of graduate secondary teachers who are pedagogically trained. To this end the project would&#13;
finance four principal types of investments:&#13;
(a)    (i) Four Fellowships (4 staff years) for trained teachers, who hold degrees in the relevant&#13;
subject areas, to be trained as teacher educators--one candidate for each of the four core&#13;
subject areas, i.e., science, mathematics, language arts and social studies, and&#13;
(ii) Six Fellowships (6 staff years) to secondary teachers, who hold a university degree but&#13;
have not had pedagogical training, to enable them to pursue such training at UWI;&#13;
(b)    equipment for the teacher training department of TAMCC for science and language&#13;
laboratories and materials and equipment for the Resource Center;&#13;
23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(c)    Conduct of in-service training programs for primary school teachers on a systematic basis,&#13;
drawing upon the services of qualified staff of MOE as needed;&#13;
(i)   to raise to an acceptable level the competence of trained and untrained teachers in&#13;
primary schools in the four core subject areas; the programn would take full&#13;
advantage of suitable existing materials such as those produced by OCOD.&#13;
Overall, it is projected that these programs will serve about 400 teachers over the&#13;
period 1996-2000;&#13;
(ii)   to improve the pedagogical skills of trained and untrained teachers;&#13;
(iii)   to orient and train teachers and principals in areas essential to their improved&#13;
functioning in the classroom and in school management, such as test construction,&#13;
use of reading materials, organization of the curriculum at the school level,&#13;
utilization of staff and facilities, curriculum changes.&#13;
The scope of this program and the budget for this would be agreed upon in advance with the Bank on a&#13;
year-to-year basis, as part of the annual project programming exercise.&#13;
(d)    Studies of teacher attrition and effectiveness and the impact of training of teacher training.&#13;
5.17   MOE (EPU in collaboration with TAMCC) would examine current proposals to accelerate the&#13;
elimination of the backlog of untrained teachers in the system by the year 2002. These proposals include&#13;
the use of distance teaching methods and the introduction of pre-service training (to complement the current&#13;
practice of drawing the intake into the full-time training program exclusively from the ranks of serving&#13;
teachers). Changes, if any, would be included in the long-range plan to be prepared for the sector. MOE&#13;
would also conduct studies of teacher effectiveness and attrition and the impact of the training program on&#13;
teacher performance. In-service training would be conducted in consultation with the Grenada Union of&#13;
Teachers which has shown interest in the professional development of teachers.&#13;
5.18   As part of the effort to professionalize the teaching service, TAMCC would require all new&#13;
entrants into the two year diploma training program after 1998 to have at least four GCE "O" level or&#13;
CXC equivalent passes, including English, Mathematics, a Social Studies subject and a Science subject.&#13;
Moreover, by the year 2000, all teachers in the primary schools who have not secured at least four CXC or&#13;
GCE "O" level passes in each of the four core subject areas will be reassigned either to other suitable&#13;
public service jobs or, if they have demonstrated special ability to work with young children, to the Pre-&#13;
School system. The TAMCC Teacher Training Department would need to expand its staff of tutors to 12&#13;
to cover current responsibilities.&#13;
5.19   School Supervision.   The project seeks to build the capacity of the school supervisory service to&#13;
better monitor and assist the schools in such key areas as: (a) performance assessment of teachers,&#13;
principals and schools, and (b) in-service training and orientation of teachers and principals in school&#13;
management concepts and effective school operations. To support these objectives, the project would&#13;
provide:&#13;
(a)    Fellowships (total of two staff years) for two persons each to pursue a one-year advanced&#13;
training program in school supervision, with particular attention to training in methods of&#13;
promoting school effectiveness, coupled with brief attachments to relevant external&#13;
agencies;&#13;
(b)    Furniture, equipment and supplies, including computers and software,&#13;
24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(c)    Civil works for office space; and&#13;
(d)    Local training, including:&#13;
(i)    periodic training courses for supervisors and principals to keep them abreast of&#13;
system developments/reforms in planning, curriculum, testing, educational&#13;
materials and teacher training, thereby helping to build the requisite support&#13;
system for the reform process; and&#13;
(ii)   training bv supervisors and other specialized MOE staff, as required, for&#13;
principals and teachers on the above topics, with similar objectives; and&#13;
(iii)   training of school principals and vice principals in school management and&#13;
organization.&#13;
5.20   Curriculum Development.      To provide the requisite technical expertise to continually review&#13;
and revise, as appropriate, the syllabi for the primary and lower secondary curricula, with special attention&#13;
to the core subjects--mathematics, language arts, social studies and science--and to streamline the curricula,&#13;
the project would strengthen the Curriculum Development Unit (CDU), by providing:&#13;
(a)    Fellowships (4 staff years) for four persons to pursue one-year advanced level training&#13;
programs in curriculum design, research, evaluation and supervision, one in each of the&#13;
four core subject areas;&#13;
(b)    Civil Works for Office space;&#13;
(c)    Supplementary office furniture, equipment and supplies, including computers, software,&#13;
equipment maintenance;&#13;
(d)    Local training, via (workshops) for MOE staff, principals, TAMCC tutors and teachers to&#13;
be conducted by the returned fellows, and&#13;
(e)    Studies relating to effectiveness of syllabi and curricula&#13;
5.21   To support improved teaching of syllabi at the school level, the project would finance:&#13;
(a)    Science kits (priority science equipment) and related storage units for this equipment for&#13;
up to 60 primary schools, to further enhance science teaching;&#13;
(b)    Social studies kits and mathematics kits for up to 60 primary schools;&#13;
(c)    Supplementary instructional supplies, equipment and materials for select secondary&#13;
schools, especially in science, on the basis of lists of schools and equipment to be agreed&#13;
with the Bank and Association in advance.&#13;
At least one kit in each subject area would be supplied to the Teacher Training department of&#13;
TAMCC for demonstration purposes.&#13;
5.22   Production and Procurement of Educational Materials.  The project also would strengthen the&#13;
capacity of MOE to prepare and produce educational materials (including textbooks, especially for the&#13;
early grades, supplementary materials, teacher support materials, etc.) and to procure educational&#13;
25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
materials. The impact of textbooks on student achievement is well documented and understood. With&#13;
expert assistance, MOE would review cost-effective options regarding procurement, preparation,&#13;
publication, manufacturing and distribution of textbooks and supporting materials, with a view to&#13;
maximizing local (particularly private sector) participation in these processes, as appropriate. MOE would&#13;
also adopt improved methods of textbook selection, standardizing and streamlining the number of textbooks&#13;
per subject, to the extent feasible, as well as exploring additional measures to ease the financial burden of&#13;
textbook purchase on parents. Educational materials, especially textbooks, are needed especially in multi-&#13;
grade teaching situations. Teachers now have to purchase textbooks for their use on the job. Many&#13;
students are without their full complement of textbooks for reasons of financial capacity. This sub-&#13;
component would set MOE on the path to finding feasible ways of addressing the quality and cost of&#13;
textbooks and their equitable distribution.&#13;
5.23   Specifically, the project would finance:&#13;
(a)    Fellowships (two staff years) for two degree holders each to pursue a one-year program of&#13;
advanced training, one in general editing and publishing and the other in art editing and&#13;
publishing, with subsequent attachments to appropriate publishing houses;&#13;
(b)    Expert services (eight months) for two specialists to include: (i) six months of assistance to&#13;
help the MOE to determine its policy and role in regard to preparing, publishing and&#13;
distributing educational materials and to evaluate and adopt, as appropriate, alternative&#13;
methods of procuring materials, and (ii) two months of assistance to advise on educational&#13;
materials production and desk-top publishing. The experts would train local staff in&#13;
publishing and production tasks respectively;&#13;
(c)    Civil Works for office space;&#13;
(d)    Office furniture, equipment and supplies, including paper, to support expanded and&#13;
improved manuscript development, word processing and desk top publishing, etc., and&#13;
equipment maintenance;&#13;
(e)    Supplementary instructional equipment, materials and supplies, including text books in the&#13;
core subjects, in about 10 selected primary schools with preference given to schools which&#13;
are performing poorly in the CEE and SLC and to schools where multi-grade teaching is&#13;
being adopted to cope with the adjustment in teacher to student ratios, on the basis of lists&#13;
of schools and materials to be supplied, such lists to be agreed in advance with the Bank&#13;
and the Association.&#13;
(f)    A supply of basic textbooks for use by teachers of Grades 1-9 in each primary and&#13;
secondary school;&#13;
(g)    Local training in publishing and production tasks by the experts, and in writing and&#13;
illustrating by the returned fellows; and&#13;
(h)    Studies concerning the supply of educational materials and their impact on learning and&#13;
teaching.&#13;
5.24   Educational Testing and Measurement. Systematic and scientific evaluation of student&#13;
performance is essential in the educational process to guide both the student and the teacher as well as the&#13;
26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
management of the system as to areas of strength and weakness so that remedial steps can be taken in a&#13;
timely manner. To improve the current system of terminal exams and to broaden it to cover testing within&#13;
the primary and secondary cycles, an Educational Testing and Examinations (ETX) Unit would be&#13;
established within MOE. The principal functions of the Unit would be to: 1) evaluate and modify, as&#13;
appropriate, current terminal examinations given at the end of primary and senior primary education, i.e.,&#13;
the Common Entrance Examination and the School Leaving Certificate Examination; 2) develop, pilot test,&#13;
and introduce new exams to be given nationwide at designated points (particularly two years before the&#13;
CEE) in the primary cycle and at Form 3 of the secondary school, to better measure student and school&#13;
perfomnance; 3) develop national norms and desired achievement standards; and 4) conduct research on&#13;
achievement and learning.&#13;
5.25   To directly support the new ETX Unit, the project would provide:&#13;
(a)    Two fellowships (total of 2 staff years) for persons to pursue advanced studies in&#13;
Educational Testing and Measurement; and to serve on a suitable short-term attachment&#13;
subsequent to training (possibly at the Caribbean Examinations Council--CXC); one of the&#13;
fellows should have a strong mathematics/science background and the other a language&#13;
arts or social science background; one of them should be strong in psychology;&#13;
(b)    Expert services (6 months) to assist ETX at key points;&#13;
(c)    Civil works for office space to include especially secure working space (a walk-in vault);&#13;
(d)    Office furniture, equipment and supplies for data analysis, word processing, scoring&#13;
(including optical scanning), desk-top publishing, and printing;&#13;
(e)    Funding for studies, including pilot testing of new tests, establishment of norms and&#13;
standards of achievement and for school evaluation (including school-based continuous&#13;
assessment), and analysis and dissemination of results of tests and examinations,&#13;
development of curriculum evaluation methods, studies of significant disparities in student&#13;
achievement by school, district, gender and any other important factor, and the initiation of&#13;
longitudinal studies, and&#13;
(f)    Local on-the-job training, including item writing workshops as well as orientation seminars&#13;
for principals and teachers in the interpretation and constructive use of test scores.&#13;
Expansion of Access to Schools Component (US$4.7 million equivalent, or 55 percent of total base&#13;
costs)&#13;
5.26   The project would expand access to basic (in particular, secondary) education and assist the MOE&#13;
to rehabilitate selected primary schools in urgent need of such action. A school mapping exercise,&#13;
conducted with expert assistance in June 1995, identified serious shortfalls in secondary school places and&#13;
the need for a more equitable geographic distribution of such places; however, the study confirmed that,&#13;
overall, an expansion of enrollment capacity of the primary school system was not necessary. The project&#13;
would include provision for an increase of at least 525 secondary places (one new school), and a modest&#13;
expansion of about 140 places at an existing secondary school, both of the schools being located outside St.&#13;
George's. This additional space, which would accommodate about seven percent of the 12-16 age group,&#13;
coupled with better utilization of space in existing secondary schools, is expected to permit primary to&#13;
secondary transition rates to rise to around 68 percent by the Year 2000. The project would also provide&#13;
27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
for reconstruction of two existing Assisted primary schools that are now housed in unsuitable&#13;
accommodation. The new primary school buildings and the secondary school expansion will be&#13;
constructed on lands which now belong to the two churches concerned (Catholic and Anglican&#13;
respectively).&#13;
5.27   To these ends, the project would finance:&#13;
(a)    Civil works, furniture and equipment, and equipment maintenance for one new secondary&#13;
school in Westerhall (for which a suitable site has been selected), to increase coverage in&#13;
an un-served area, and expansion and improvement of St. Andrew's Anglican Secondary&#13;
School (SAASS) in Grenville, and&#13;
(b)    Civil Works for replacement of two existing primary schools (St. John's RC School in&#13;
Guoyave and St. Theresa's RC School in St. David's) and supplementary furniture and&#13;
equipment;&#13;
(c)    Rehabilitation of selected primary and secondary schools with urgent needs according to a&#13;
programn to be agreed in the light of the priorities indicated in the ongoing inventory of&#13;
school facilities, subject to a ceiling of US$100,000 equivalent for any one school.&#13;
The schedule of accommodation of the works to be undertaken under (a) and (b) above is provided&#13;
in Annex 5, Appendix.&#13;
5.28   To complement project-financed activities, the Government, via the MOE, would undertake the&#13;
training of select school staff in preventive maintenance and mobilization of community support for&#13;
maintenance. The Government would ensure either (a) public access to any public school constructed on&#13;
church lands or (b) public ownership or lease of the lands for the construction of such schools.&#13;
28&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING PLAN&#13;
A. Project Costs&#13;
6.1     The total project cost is estimated at US$9.9 million equivalent, including duties and taxes&#13;
(US$0.6 million equivalent) physical contingencies and price increases. The foreign exchange component&#13;
represents US$7.6 million equivalent, or 77 percent of total project cost. A summary of project costs by&#13;
major components is provided in Table 6.1. As a percentage of base costs, financing for the three major&#13;
components is as follows: Management and Planning, 19 percent, lmproving Educational Quality, 26&#13;
percent, and Expansion of Access, 55 percent. Table 6.2 provides project cost by key categories of&#13;
expenditure, disaggregated by investrnent and recurrent costs. Detailed cost tables are provided in Annex&#13;
6, Table 1.&#13;
6.2     The cost estimates are based on prices as of June 1995. To the base cost of the civil works, 12&#13;
percent has been added to cover the costs of professional consultant services, to meet the needs for&#13;
architectural design and tender preparation and contract administration.&#13;
6.3     ContinRency Allowances.           Total contingencies of US$1.4 million equivalent represent 16&#13;
percent of baseline project cost. These include physical contingencies of US$0.9 million equivalent,&#13;
averaging 10 percent across the discrete components. Price contingencies (US$0.5 million equivalent),&#13;
represent six percent of project baseline cost, and are based on the following assumptions: (a) a local&#13;
inflation rate of 3.0 percent in 1995, and 3.6 percent per year thereafter; and (b) price increases for foreign&#13;
costs, estimated in US dollars, of 3.3 percent in 1995, and 2.7 percent for the remaining four years of&#13;
project implementation. Cost calculations also assume a constant exchange rate of EC$2.7 to US$ 1.00 for&#13;
the five-year project implementation period.&#13;

B. Recurrent Costs and Project Sustainability&#13;
6.4    Incremental Recurrent Costs.   New recurrent costs to be generated by this project are estimated&#13;
to be about US$0.77 million equivalent by the end of the decade in current prices. Detailed estimates of&#13;
recurrent costs to be generated by the project are presented in Annex 6 Appendix. The new costs are&#13;
attributable mainly to: (a) increased allocations required to pay additional staff to operate the key units of&#13;
the MOE involved in the education reform process; (b) additional allowances for school supplies and&#13;
materials and for maintenance of school plant; (c) operating expenditures for new secondary school places,&#13;
and (d) maintenance costs for the equipment in the new MOE offices. However, these costs are not all&#13;
incremental because they are largely offset by the savings generated from the adjustment in the teacher-to-&#13;
student ratios. The overall recurrent budget of MOE is expected to grow by less than one percent per year&#13;
over the project implementation period, and this growth is attributable solely to modest growth in the non&#13;
project subsectors.&#13;
6.5    These incremental costs will be offset by the US$0.8 million equivalent in savings projected to be&#13;
generated by that year from the downward adjustments in the teacher to student ratios planned for the&#13;
1995-2000 period (Annex 3 Appendix and Annex 6 Appendix). This underscores the importance of rapid&#13;
implementation of, and adherence to, such an adjustment process.&#13;
6.6    Project Sustainabilitv.  The proposed project is consistent with development priorities enunciated&#13;
by the govermnent and MOE; it is also in harmony with the OECS Reform Strategy. The planned&#13;
qualitative improvements and expansion of access to secondary education are widely viewed as essential to&#13;
achieve desired economic growth and social development objectives. Requisite Government financing for&#13;
the project, including its contribution of US$1.7 million equivalent (net of taxes) to the project costs over&#13;
30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the five year period and incremental debt service associated therewith, can be met, as they represent less&#13;
than I percent of the 1994 GDP. Further, the project will generate a net decrease of US$0.1 million in&#13;
recurrent expenditure in respect of the subsectors directly affected by the project (Table 5 of Annex3,&#13;
Appendix) Overall, the project, taking into account the adjustment measures proposed, would result in a&#13;
decline of the number of persons employed in the sector and in the personal emoluments budget for the&#13;
sector.&#13;

6.7    Grenada is eligible for IBRD borrowing under Single Currency Loan (SCL) terms because: (i) it&#13;
has no unconverted VLR82 loans, and (ii) the proposed loan does not exceeds US$100 millions, although&#13;
it represents 100 percent of IBRD lending program for FY 1996. Presented with the choice of loan&#13;
product, the Government of Grenada decided on the fixed exchange rate US dollar SCL option. This&#13;
choice was based on the effort of eliminating exchange rate volatility (the EC dollar is pegged to the US&#13;
dollar) and minimizing interest rate uncertainty for a social sector project such as the proposed one&#13;
6.8    The technical assistance program included in this project has been designed to maximize&#13;
development of local expertise and capacity in order to sustain project benefits well into the future. The&#13;
mix of expert services and fellowships, structured to complement one another, emphasizes staff capacity&#13;
building. Orientation seminars and study tours have been included to familiarize senior staff with key&#13;
aspects of educational reform. Fellows will be selected with attention to their capacity to benefit from the&#13;
respective training program and the program will be tailored as far as possible to their job needs in Grenada&#13;
and be complemented in several cases by short attachments to relevant agencies or entities abroad. .&#13;
Eligibility criteria for all project-supported training will be specified in the Project Implementation Manual.&#13;
These fellowship recipients will be drawn largely from the public service (teaching and the civil service).&#13;
Their job experience will sharpen awareness of their own training needs. Where a suitable training&#13;
program exists within UWI (which has offered to design courses to suit the needs) this would be given&#13;
preference on grounds of economy, relevance to country circumstances and enhanced scope for&#13;
harmonizing the education systems of the OECS. In keeping with normal Government policy, all fellows&#13;
will be bonded for a duration of time pro-rated with the length of their training. Upon completion of&#13;
training and return to Grenada, all fellows will be expected to produce reports on their training experience&#13;
and to conduct seminars to disseminate their newly acquired knowledge to others. Most of the expert&#13;
services will be provided in a series of short term consultancies, with these services timed in order that: (a)&#13;
while local staff remain in direct control of operations, they will receive external assistance at certain&#13;
critical junctures; and (b) the tenure of fellowships and expert service periods are optimally synchronized.&#13;
Finally, all experts will be required to train staff and to prepare manuals to help guide staff in how specific&#13;
key tasks should be organized and programmed.&#13;
31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
C. Financing Plan&#13;
6.9   The proposed project would be financed by an IBRD Loan and an IDA Credit totaling US$7.6&#13;
million equivalent, representing 77 percent of the total project cost. The combined Loan and Credit would&#13;
cover 100 percent of total foreign exchange investment expenditure and 50 percent of local exchange&#13;
investment expenditure for goods. The Government would finance US$1.7 million equivalent or 1 00&#13;
percent of all local exchange investment costs (net of taxes), except for goods financed at 50 percent of&#13;
their local exchange investrnent costs, and 100 percent of local and foreign exchange recurrent costs.&#13;
6.10   Table 6.3 provides a summary of the project financing plan. Annex 6 Table 2 includes the detailed&#13;
financing plan by project implementation year, and by component. For Project implementation, the&#13;
phasing of the Government financing and the Government's inclusion of the required amounts in the&#13;
Annual Estimates of Expenditure will be identified as a Government obligation in both the Education&#13;
Strategy Letter and the PIM.&#13;

6.11   Retroactive financing of up to SDR 512,000 (US$0.76 million equivalent), or 10 percent of&#13;
combined IBRD and IDA project financing, would be provided to reimburse the Government for eligible&#13;
expenditures incurred after October 1, 1995, to enable the Government to immediately commence requisite&#13;
steps to expedite the reform process, to include:&#13;
(a)    equipping of the newly established Project Management Unit, training of its staff in such&#13;
general areas as procurement and Bank-specific procedures, and provision of&#13;
(i)   study tours to visit other project units in the Caribbean and&#13;
(i)   expert services to assist in operationalizing the Unit;&#13;
(b)    architectural design work and tenders preparation for the civil works program; and&#13;
(c)    preparation of specifications for the educational equipment and furniture to be procured&#13;
under the project. This retroactive financing is required to permnit these important outlays&#13;
to be eligible for consideration for immediate reimbursement upon Loan and Credit&#13;
Effectiveness.&#13;
32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Project Management and Coordination&#13;
7.1   The project would be executed by the MOE through the creation of a Project Managemnent Unit&#13;
(PMU) with functions and responsibilities satisfactory to the Bank and the Association, and with at least&#13;
three full-time professional personnel -- a Project Manager, a Procurement Officer, and an Accountant --&#13;
with qualifications satisfactory to the Bank and Association, assisted by sufficient numbers of support&#13;
staff.&#13;
7.2   In implemeting the project, the PMU and other entities involved in project execution would be&#13;
guided by a Project Implementation Manual (PIM). The PIM will include, inter alia the following main&#13;
areas:&#13;
(a)    a summary of the technical content of the components and sub-components of the project;&#13;
(b)    organizational arrangements, including specific relationships, responsibilities and linkages&#13;
between distinct entities of the MOE and the PMU relating to project execution;&#13;
(c)    operational procedures to be followed in project implementation, including: criteria for&#13;
rehabilitation of primary schools; eligibility for, and processing requirements relating to,&#13;
project-supported training (fellowships, in-service local training and study tours); planning&#13;
and policy-related studies;&#13;
(d)    disbursement and procurement arrangements, including the standard bidding documents to&#13;
be used for works and goods, and standard consultant contracts and IBRD and IDA&#13;
review;&#13;
(e)   financial management and control arrangements, including management of the Project&#13;
Account and Special Account, processing of withdrawal applications, and Terms of&#13;
Reference (TORs) for internal and external project audits and time table for submission of&#13;
Annual Audit reports to IBRD and IDA;&#13;
(f)   the implementation schedule for the project and the project monitoring and evaluation&#13;
indicators to guide assessment of project implementation performance during the Annual&#13;
and Mid-Term Project Reviews; and&#13;
(g)    TORs for the professional staff of the PMU and all experts to be employed under the&#13;
project;&#13;
(h)   the obligations of the Government at project completion, including preparation of the ICR&#13;
and plans for the future of the project.&#13;
7.3    As a condition of Loan and Credit Effectiveness, the Government will be expected to have ensured&#13;
that the PIM had been issued, in terms satisfactory to the Bank and Association, and provided appropriate&#13;
assurances that the Manual is in full force and effect. The Credit and Loan Agreements indicate that,&#13;
subject to the specific provisions of these Agreements, the PIM would be binding on the Government.&#13;
33&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B. Institutional Arrangements&#13;
7.4    As a source of advice and assistance during project implementation, a Project Advisory Committee&#13;
(PAC) would be established with representation from the MOE (with the Project Manager serving as&#13;
Secretary), and from the Ministries responsible for the portfolios of finance and public works. The PAC&#13;
will meet periodically to review implementation performance and will be convened, as needed, to address&#13;
any urgent matters which might arise over the course of project execution. To ensure achievement of&#13;
project objectives, the MOE will need to collaborate closely with several other government entities,&#13;
including the Ministry of Finance, a representative of which will countersign all disbursement applications&#13;
for the project.&#13;
C. Implementation Program&#13;
7.5    The project will be implemented over the five-year period 1996-2000. A Surmmary Implementation&#13;
Program, by component and sub-component, is presented in Annex 7 Table 1. The project Completion&#13;
Date would be December 31, 2000, and the Loan and Credit Closing Dates would be June 30, 2001. Civil&#13;
works execution, overseas fellowships, and provision of expert services are heavily concentrated over the&#13;
first two years of project implementation in order to ensure that these key inputs are rapidly completed so&#13;
that the education reform process can be launched as expeditiously as possible. Thus, as highlighted in&#13;
Annex 6 Table IC, US$6.3 million equivalent or 63 percent of total project cost is expected to be incurred&#13;
over the initial 24 months of project execution.&#13;
7.6    As would be confirmed in the PIM, not later than six months after the Closing Dates, or such later&#13;
dates as may be agreed for this purpose, Government will prepare and finnish to the Bank and Association&#13;
a plan of such scope and detail as IBRD and IDA may reasonably request, for the future operation of the&#13;
Project, will exchange views with IBRD and IDA on such plan, and will carry out such plan, taking into&#13;
account IBRD and IDA comments on it.&#13;
D. Procurement&#13;
7.7    The Bank has received the Government's Store Rules and Financial Rules. Officials have stated&#13;
that the guidelines of the Government conform to those of the Bank and other external agencies, such as&#13;
CDB and the European Union. While civil works under Bank-financed projects in the education sector in&#13;
many countries have usually been procured with only minor problems, the procurement of instructional&#13;
equipment materials and supplies has proven difficult. Some of the more common and costly problems that&#13;
occur during the procurement process for such items in various countries include:&#13;
(a)   limited technical knowledge of optimum types and sources of educational equipment,&#13;
materials and supplies and, hence, difficulty in writing precise and appropriate technical&#13;
specifications;&#13;
34&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(b)   inexperience in packaging contracts to generate potential economies of scale regarding&#13;
purchase prices;&#13;
(c)    difficulties in appropriately timing the placement of orders in order to synchronize delivery&#13;
dates with the actual time that the given goods will be required, particularly to coincide&#13;
with the state of readiness of civil works;&#13;
(d)   limitations in the capacity to conduct the technical evaluation of bids;&#13;
(e)    failure to take advantage in bidding documents of opportunities for domestic preference&#13;
acceptable to the Bank;&#13;
(f)   insufficient attention to inspection of goods and bills of lading upon arrival of procured&#13;
items; and&#13;
(g)   the virtual neglect of enforcement of insurance and warranty clauses.&#13;
In varying degrees many of these problems were encountered under the OECS Regional vocational and&#13;
Technical Education Project (Credit 1785 CRG).&#13;
7.8    Several steps have been taken to minimize the risk of such problems occurring in this project.&#13;
First, at (or prior to) commencement of project implementation, the full time Procurement Officer of the&#13;
PMU, will receive intensive, practical training, and attend relevant Bank-sponsored seminars. Second,&#13;
specialized expert services will be provided at critical points in the procurement process, particularly in the&#13;
first stages of project implementation, to assist as well as to further train the Procurement Officer in areas&#13;
such as bidding technical specifications, processing and evaluation. The designation of a full-time&#13;
Procurement Officer to the PMU responds directly to the experience gained in the OECS Regional&#13;
Vocational and Technical Education Project (Credit 1785-CRG), in particular the need for constant,&#13;
careful attention to detailed selection and specifications of goods (i.e., furniture and educational and related&#13;
equipment and materials) to be purchased, and to contracting procedures, ensuring: (a) upstream,&#13;
compliance with Bank guidelines for selection of consultants and consulting firms, and procurement of civil&#13;
works and goods; and (b) downstream, that acquired goods meet specifications and that equipment is&#13;
appropriately and safely installed and utilized.&#13;
7.9    To both guide and expedite the procurement process, specification lists for goods to be procured&#13;
with project financing, and bidding documents for the procurement of civil works and goods based on&#13;
standard Bank documents, will be prepared according to the Implementation Program. To further advance&#13;
preparation of civil works, architectural designs will be completed with retroactive financing, in order to&#13;
permit initiation of the actual bidding process immediately upon declaration of Loan and Credit&#13;
Effectiveness. Procurement procedures to be followed for all major categories of expenditures to be&#13;
financed by IBRD and IDA are described below and summarized in Table 7.1.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Civil Works&#13;
7.10 Civil works to be procured with project financing (expected to total US$6.0 million equivalent,&#13;
including contingencies) consist of the following:&#13;
(i)   one new secondary school of 525 places in Westerha11 and the upgrading and&#13;
expansion by 140 places of the SAASS secondary school;&#13;
(ii)   the replacement of two primary schools, one of 600 places and the other of 245&#13;
places and;&#13;
(iii)   rehabilitation of selected primary and secondary schools, and&#13;
(iv)    new office space for MOE management and technical units.&#13;
7.11  In view of the small value of all such works, the Bank Standard Bidding Documents (SBD) to be&#13;
used for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) would be "Procurement of Works - Smaller Contracts"&#13;
and these same documents, modified as necessary, would be used for National Competitive Bidding (NCB).&#13;
All civil works contracts valued at US$0.5 million and above would be awarded on the basis of ICB,&#13;
consistent with IBRD and IDA guidelines."5 Civil works estimated to cost the equivalent of US$100,000 or&#13;
more, but less than the equivalent of US$0.5 million per contract, up to an aggregate amount equivalent to&#13;
US$1.0 million, may be procured on the basis of NCB. Civil works, (including works for rehabilitation of&#13;
selected schools), estimated to cost less than the equivalent of US$100,000 per contract, up to an aggregate&#13;
amount equivalent to US$1.0 million may, consistent with IBRD and IDA guidelines, be procured under&#13;
lumpsum, fixed price contracts, awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from three qualified&#13;
contractors in response to a witten invitation and made to the contractor who offers the lowest price&#13;
quotation and has the experience and resources to complete the contract successfully. All school&#13;
rehabilitation works would require full documentation to include: certification by the MOE that the works&#13;
were of a priority nature, consistent with the findings of the school facilities inventory; an approved budget&#13;
for the subject work; review by the consultants for civil works of designs and/or bidding documents prior to&#13;
initiating any such works, and certification by the consultants for civil works that the work was efficiently,&#13;
fully and satisfactorily completed; and appropriate documentation of national shopping procedures applied&#13;
in the selection of contractors, all of which documentation would be maintained for review by IBRD and&#13;
IDA supervision missions. No individual school would normally be expected to receive rehabilitation&#13;
works in excess of an aggregate amount of US$100,000 equivalent.&#13;
Goods&#13;
7.12   School and Office Equipment (estimated to cost US$385,000 equivalent, including contingencies),&#13;
Furniture (US$244,000), Vehicles (US$92,000), Books and other educational materials (US$331,000) and&#13;
Office Sup,lies (US$273,000)--a total of US$1.4 million equivalent, including contingencies- would be&#13;
grouped into packages as far as practicable and procured in the following manner consistent with Bank&#13;
Guidelines:&#13;
(a)   contract packages estimated to cost the equivalent of US$50,000 or more may be procured&#13;
through ICB;&#13;
5 All references in this Report to Bank Guidelines on procurement are related to the Bank publication:&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(b)    contract packages estimated to cost more than US$15,000 but less than US$50,000&#13;
equivalent and US$900,000 or less in the aggregate may be procured through international&#13;
shopping procedures, and&#13;
(c)    contract packages estimated to cost less than US$15,000 equivalent and less than&#13;
US$300,000 in the aggregate may be procured through national shopping procedures.&#13;
7.13   Computer Hardware and Software (estimated to cost US$209,000 equivalent, including&#13;
contingencies) would be grouped into packages as far as practicable and procured in the following manner&#13;
consistent with Bank Guidelines:&#13;
(a)    Contract packages estimated to cost US$50,000 equivalent or more may be procured through LIB;&#13;
exceptionally, and with previous Bank no objection, packages of small value may be procured through&#13;
shopping procedures.&#13;
7.14   With regard to vehicles and computers, bidding lists of eligible bidders would include only&#13;
manufacturers who have established maintenance and service facilities in Grenada or in neighboring&#13;
countries.&#13;
Technical Assistance&#13;
7.15  (a)    Professional service contracts (expected to total US$629,000 equivalent including&#13;
contingencies) for architectural design, tendering, and supervision/administration of contracts relating to the&#13;
execution of civil works would be procured according to Bank guidelines for the use of consultants.'6&#13;
7.16  (b)    Expert Services (expected to total US$453,000 equivalent, including contingencies), to&#13;
include contracts for consultants and consulting firms, would be procured in accordance with the World&#13;
Bank guidelines for the use of consultants. Details of project-financed Expert Services (excluding&#13;
professional services for civil works) and Fellowships are provided in Annex 7 Table 2.&#13;
7.17  (c)    Fellowships (expected to total US$793,000 equivalent including contingencies) would be&#13;
awarded only to persons suitably qualified to enter upon the agreed training programs, following&#13;
government selection procedures acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
7.18  (d)    Local Traininz (expected to total US$278,000 equivalent including contingencies) would&#13;
be arranged by the specialized service of MOE concerned and the PMU. Trainers would be selected in&#13;
consultation between the concerned section of MOE and the PMU.&#13;
7.19  (e)    For Studies (expected to total US$121,000 equivalent, including contingencies), the PMU&#13;
and the concerned department of MOE would consult on the selection of consulting services and the PMU&#13;
would procure these in keeping with IBRD and IDA gtuidelines. For procurement of any necessary&#13;
materials, in view of the small amounts involved, national shopping would be used.&#13;

IBRD and IDA Review&#13;
7.20   Government assurances would be obtained and incorporated in the PIM that: (a) prior to initiating&#13;
any civil works or acquisition of goods to be procured through ICB or LIB, and for those civil works to be&#13;
procured via NCB, it will submit to the Bank for its prior review all relevant documentation; (b) with&#13;
regard to consultants and consulting firms, all proposed contracts and related terms of reference, short lists&#13;
of candidates, proposed fees, etc. would be submitted for prior IBRD and IDA review to ensure consistency&#13;
with Bank guidelines on use of consultants; and (c) prior to the award of any fellowship it will submit to&#13;
the Bank and IDA for its review, to ensure consistency with project objectives, the names and resumes of&#13;
all short listed candidates, the proposed training program and training institution, the proposed duration of&#13;
training, and the estimated cost. The budget for local training and for studies would be agreed with the&#13;
Bank in advance of initiating such activities and all relevant documentation concerning expenditures on&#13;
agreed studies and training would be retained for review by Bank/IDA supervision missions. The level of&#13;
prior review coverage as a percentage of Bank financed contracts would be approximately 60 percent of&#13;
goods and works and 100 percent of consultant contracts.&#13;
E. Disbursements and Accounts&#13;
7.21   The proposed amount of lending -- Credit of SDR 2.6 million (US$3.8 million equivalent) and a&#13;
Loan of US$3.8 million equivalent-- would be disbursed over a five-year period, typical of other IBRD&#13;
and IDA-supported social sector projects. Annex 7, Table 3 presents the disbursement forecast for the&#13;
Loan and Credit, by semester and by financier. The Loan and Credit are expected to be fully disbursed&#13;
over 10 semesters, commencing immediately at Loan and Credit Effectiveness with the disbursement for&#13;
retroactive financing and the initial disbursement into the project Special Account. To facilitate timely&#13;
project implementation, the Government would establish, mnaintain and operate, under terms and conditions&#13;
satisfactory to IBRD and IDA, a Special Account in US dollars at a bank acceptable to IBRD and IDA in&#13;
Grenada. The Authorized allocation for the Special Account would be US$0.5 million equivalent, with an&#13;
initial deposit to be made of US$0.25 million equivalent, and such allocation to remain limited to an&#13;
amount equivalent to US$0.25 million until the aggregate amount of withdrawals from the Credit Account,&#13;
plus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by the Association, shall be equal&#13;
to or exceed the equivalent of US$ 1.0 million. As the PIM would indicate: (a) the Special Account would&#13;
be managed by the PMU of the MOE, with all disbursements made under authorized signatures from&#13;
designated representatives of both the Ministry of Finance and the PMU and (b) withdrawal applications&#13;
for replenishment of the Special Account would be prepared by the PMU in accordance with Bank policies&#13;
and procedures.&#13;
7.22   The Government would open a Project Account in a bank acceptable to IBRD and IDA and deposit&#13;
into such account an amount equivalent to not less than US$250,000, for purposes of financing the&#13;
implementation of civil works to be carried out under the project, and maintain a positive balance in such&#13;
account over the implementation period, in the amounts stipulated in the Development Credit Agreement,&#13;
during which period all civil works are expected to be fully executed.&#13;
7.23   Table 7.2 contains the projected Loan and Credit disbursement plan. Disbursements would be&#13;
effected against the following expenditure categories, by percentage of IBRD and IDA financing: (a) civil&#13;
works, for construction of the new secondary at Westerhall school and the facilities at the existing&#13;
39&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
secondary school in Grenville, the office space for MOE and the relocated primary schools and for&#13;
professional fees related thereto for design, tender preparation and contract administration--72 percent of&#13;
total cost; (b) civil works for rehabilitation of selected primary and secondary schools and professional fees&#13;
related thereto--72 percent of total cost, subject to a maximum not to exceed US$ 100,000 per contract;&#13;
(c) goods, including all equipment, furniture, educational materials, including textbooks, computers and&#13;
software, and supplies and miscellaneous-I 00 percent of foreign expenditures and 50 percent of local&#13;
expenditures; (d) technical assistance, including expert services --100 percent of eligible expenditures,&#13;
fellowships--95 percent of eligible expenditures, and (e) training and studies-50 percent of total cost.&#13;

7.24    Withdrawal applications for civil works with a contract value of US$100,000 equivalent or more,&#13;
and goods with a contract value of US$50,000 equivalent or more, would be supported by fill&#13;
documentation. Disbursements for all contracts for goods and civil works of less than the above respective&#13;
amounts, including works associated with the rehabilitation and repair of primary schools, would be made&#13;
on the basis of Statements of Expenditure (SOEs) certified by the PMU. Supporting documentation for&#13;
these latter expenditures would be retained by the PMU and be readily available for periodic review by&#13;
IBRD and IDA supervision missions.&#13;
40&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
F. Financial Management, Accounting and Audits&#13;
7.25   The existing financial management system in MOE would require strengthening over the medium-&#13;
tern in order to support the modernization of the administration of the MOE. Improvements are needed in&#13;
accounting and budgeting and in financial analysis and planning. To these ends, the project supports&#13;
overseas graduate training of a person in financial management and analysis, as well as the establishment&#13;
of an integrated, computerized education data system, that would include financial records. With respect to&#13;
project accounts, the Project Implementation Manual will delineate financial management and control&#13;
procedures, and provide TORs for intemal and extemal audits, satisfactory to IBRD and IDA.&#13;
7.26   The MOE would keep separate accounts for project incurred expenditures according to the&#13;
proposed Charts of Accounts (as detailed in Schedule I of the Loan and Credit Agreements) and prepare a&#13;
monthly statement of expenditures. This procedure will facilitate the preparation of withdrawal&#13;
applications preparation and expedite the disbursement process. Annual audits of all project accounts,&#13;
including the Special Account, will be undertaken by an independent auditor. Initially, it is proposed that&#13;
this independent auditor be the Government's Director of Audit. Audit reports under TORs satisfactory to&#13;
IBRD and IDA would be prepared and submitted to the Bank and Association not later than four months&#13;
after the end of each fiscal year, i.e., not later than April 30. Should the Government Audit Department at&#13;
any time prove to be unable to carry out such audits in a timely fashion, the use of a private sector firm&#13;
would be required by the Bank and the Association. For this latter purpose, the project includes funding&#13;
for any necessary technical assistance.&#13;
G. Project Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
(1) Project Performance Reporting&#13;
7.27   Overall responsibility for monitoring, evaluation and reporting of project perfbrmance would be&#13;
assigned to the PMU. The PMU also would be responsible for preparation of the Borrower's section of the&#13;
Implementation Completion Report (ICR) that would be transmitted to the IBRD and IDA not later than&#13;
six months after the Closing Date. To ensure and expedite fulfillment of periodic reporting requirements&#13;
relating to project implementation status, and to facilitate the conduct of regular project supervision&#13;
missions, in keeping with the procedures to be included in the PIM, (a) consolidated project progress&#13;
reports (starting in 1996) would be prepared by the PMU each six months, i.e., on March 31 and&#13;
September 30 each year, and would be distributed to IBRD and IDA; and (b) the September 30 report&#13;
would serve as the basis for an annual in depth review of project performance to be carried out jointly by&#13;
the Government, IBRD and IDA.&#13;
7.28   The annual September 30 project status report will include: (i) a summary of the project&#13;
performance over the past year, including agreed project monitoring and evaluation indicators, as are&#13;
delineated in Annex 7 Table 5; and (ii) a detailed work program and budget (that would include planned&#13;
contracting of expert services and initiation of planning and policy-related studies over the given year) for&#13;
the forthcoming year of project implementation, including a realistic implementation schedule and targets&#13;
for moving the project toward its successful completion. The Project Monitoring and Evaluation Indicators&#13;
will be delineated in the PIM.&#13;
41&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(2) Project Reviews&#13;
7.29   Annual reviews of project performance would take place no later than November 30 each calendar&#13;
year 1997-2000 between the IBRD and IDA and Government. As part of such Annual Review, the MOE&#13;
may be asked to prepare an action plan, satisfactory to IBRD and IDA, to make adjustments in project&#13;
implementation, as the review process may indicate to be needed to achieve project objectives. In such&#13;
case, the Government should furnish this action plan to IBRD/IDA no later than one month after&#13;
conclusion of the respective review, and shall thereafter carry out such action plan in accordance with its&#13;
terms. A joint Mid-Term Review of the performance of the Basic Education Reform Project and the&#13;
education reform process which it supports would be undertaken not later than September 30, 1998. For&#13;
such review, the PMU would prepare, and jointly IBRD, IDA and the Government (and, possibly, CDB)&#13;
would review a sumnnary report containing an assessment of: (a) the overall implementation performance&#13;
of the project during its first two-and-one-half years in terms of its progress toward achieving the agreed&#13;
project objectives, targets and indicators; (b) the adequacy of available and planned project financing; (c)&#13;
compliance with IBRD and IDA procurement and disbursement requirements, and (d) the outcome of the&#13;
annual audit reports. Subsequent to this review, a plan of action to guide the successful completion of the&#13;
project will be prepared.&#13;
H. Project Supervision&#13;
7.30   During supervision missions, which will be timed so as to follow closely upon the half yearly&#13;
reports, the Bank and Association will:&#13;
(a)   review the achievements in project implementation against the Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
indicators as set out in Annex 7 Table 5 and covered in the half yearly report;&#13;
(b)    assist in resolving problems that have emerged since the previous supervision mission;&#13;
(c)    discuss any changes in policy or the functioning of the sector that have a bearing on the&#13;
project and project implementation and;&#13;
(d)   review selected documents retained in project files pertaining to procurement of goods and&#13;
works.&#13;
In particular, as the following activities are ongoing, the supervision missions will pay special attention to:&#13;
(i)   the adjustment of teacher to student ratios, the changes in the ratio of salary to non&#13;
salary expenditures, and the application of resources to school maintenance and&#13;
supplies;&#13;
(ii)   the preparation and processing of the long range sector plan;&#13;
(iii)   the strengthening of management and planning in MOE, including project&#13;
management capacity;&#13;
(iv)    the program of studies, and&#13;
(v)    the quality of expert services provided.&#13;
7.31   As this project will be a first effort of the kind in the sector in the country and the investment is&#13;
front loaded, the visits of supervision missions will be more frequent in the early stages: every four months&#13;
42&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
in the first year of implementation, every six months thereafter, each visit involving a total of about 3 staff&#13;
days. Other ad hoc missions or a longer stay in the field may be necessary for the resolution of specific&#13;
problems that may arise.&#13;
I. Environmental Impact&#13;
7.32   The proposed project does not represent environmental risks. It is expected to be assigned a "C"&#13;
environmental classification.&#13;
43&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8. EXPECTED BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
8.33   Proiect Benefits   The principal benefit to be derived from the proposed project is its contribution&#13;
to building institutional capacity, particularly at the MOE headquarters, to manage the systems efficiently,&#13;
to plan and develop the sector in a cost effective manner, and in cooperation with a reinforced central&#13;
planning division to monitor performance of the school system and diagnose and address problems relating&#13;
to educational quality. As such, the project would lay the groundwork for effective absorption of future&#13;
investments. The project would similarly strengthen management at the school level. The project would&#13;
promote increased collaboration between key public and private sector entities involved in the education&#13;
sector at the national and regional level; and would be consistent with the OECS Education Reform&#13;
Strategy, hence facilitating cooperation with other OECS countries embarking on this process, in particular&#13;
in such areas as achievement testing, integrated education data systems, and expansion and upgrading of&#13;
educational materials production in which there is common interest. Such cooperation is important because&#13;
of the small size of the pool of talent available within each country. Major improvements are expected in&#13;
the quality of education provided throughout the compulsory cycle and, hence, in student achievement and&#13;
employment potential, from the range of investments directed at expanding and improving the educational&#13;
system--trained teachers, modernized and streamlined curricula, more and appropriate educational&#13;
materials, professional and more frequent educational testing and measurement, and better maintained&#13;
school plant. Improved quality of primary education is expected to help ensure that many more students&#13;
will be prepared to benefit fully from secondary education, as access to it increases. The project would&#13;
also significantly increase educational opportunities, particularly for youth from the more remote areas.&#13;
Some 1500-2000 children are expected to benefit from project support for the provision of textbooks to&#13;
disadvantages school. An additional 665 children or about 7% of the secondary school age cohort will have&#13;
access to secondary education as a result of project-financed civil works&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
8.34   The principal risks associated with this project relate to:&#13;
(i) the inadequate institutional capacity to carry out the education reform process, including possible failure&#13;
to augment the MOE with requisite additional qualified staff; (ii) unavailability of sufficient Government&#13;
financing in the difficult fiscal situation to sustain reforms and in view of the vulnerability of the country to&#13;
economic shocks and natural disasters; (iii) failure to adjust, and/or to closely monitor compliance with&#13;
adjusted, teacher to student ratios in primary and secondary schools; (iv) reluctance to adopt regional,&#13;
collaborative approaches, given their inherent delays, even when these may represent the most efficient and&#13;
effective long-term approaches, and (v) PMU problems in meeting the administrative demands presented&#13;
by heavy front loading of implementation over the first two years, given limited experience with&#13;
implementing Bank-financed projects. To minimize potential institutional failures, strong emphasis is&#13;
placed on sector planning and institutional strengthening, including extensive staff upgrading via both&#13;
44&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
overseas and local training, and Government assurances that the MOE personnel complement will be&#13;
expanded to ensure that expertise exists to fulfill its broad education sector development mandate.&#13;
8.35   Given vulnerabilities of this small economy to external factors and shocks, Government project&#13;
financing has been kept within easily met ranges at present and projected GDP, and has been concentrated&#13;
on investments, that heavily involve local costs i.e., equipment maintenance and the local cost portion of&#13;
civil works. Incremental recurrent costs generated by project components, which often hamper&#13;
achievement of education sector reforns, will be largely offset by resources to be released from adjusting&#13;
teacher to student ratios over the project implementation period. Presentation of a schedule for this&#13;
adjustment program will be included in the Education Policy Letter. Minimization of financial risks is&#13;
achieved through the choice of loan product by the Government: fixed rate US dollar SCL (para. 6.7).&#13;
Moreover, the project places emphasis on the early preparation of a long term sector development plan&#13;
which would serve as a vehicle for achieving national consensus on the principal directions of sector&#13;
development into the next decade. Finally, the monitoring system and annual evaluations will permit to&#13;
adopt timely adjustments in project implementation needed to achieve project objectives.&#13;
8.36   To actively promote inter-country collaboration, high priority will continue to be assigned to&#13;
pooling technical resources, encouraging use of Caribbean expertise, sharing of experiences, and&#13;
developing regional interventions, where appropriate and feasible. Experience gained in preparing and&#13;
launching the St. Lucia education will continue to be drawn upon. Several measures are being taken to&#13;
facilitate smooth, timely project implementation, amid front loading of investments, including: (a)&#13;
advancing start-up of crucial activities, e.g., architectural designs and equipment and furniture specification&#13;
lists, to be carried out before Effectiveness; (b) training of PMU staff in key management areas prior to&#13;
project commencement, to be facilitated by retroactive financing; and (c) provision of 8 months of Project&#13;
Management expert services to support the PMU over the initial months of project execution.&#13;
45&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

No: The figures on the population in the age group have been projected on the basis of the data&#13;
supplied by the Central Statistical Office; the data on enrollments come from the MOE statistical&#13;
unit. For the yeqr 1992-93, it is unclear why the enrollment figures exceed population figures in&#13;
the relevant age groups. The global figures given in para 2.1 refer to 1993-94.&#13;
On enrollment, the Law requires the attendance of all children between the ages of five&#13;
and sixteen. The primary school is not supposed to (but does) contain persons outside that age&#13;
bracket. The picture in primary schools is also confused because the schools are not supposed to&#13;
report these extra persons in the statistics but they sometimes do. Moreover, the distinction&#13;
between the pre-school that operates in the premises of several primary schools and the primary&#13;
school itself is not always clear.&#13;

PROPOSED BASIC EDUCATION PROJECT&#13;
WORKING PAPER--REALLOCATION OF SECTOR BUDGETARY PROVISIONS&#13;
1.     In the education sector in Grenada, there are two overriding efficiency issues-one concerning the&#13;
efficiency of management and the other the efficiency of the schools:&#13;
(a)    the absence of sufficient specialized management staff to lead and guide the schools and&#13;
(b)    the low share of school budgets spent on non-salary items.&#13;
The management deficiency is masked by persistent, hard work of a few, but a broader and better staffed&#13;
effort is needed to sustain reform and, ironically, to keep costs within reasonable bounds. Low non-salary&#13;
expenditure seriously affects teacher morale and student performance.&#13;
2.     The Governments financial effort on behalf of education falls within the lower end of a reasonable&#13;
range (1 5%--25%) of the national recurrent budget; the sector share is budgeted to be 16.6% in 1995 and&#13;
will probably rise slightly over the medium term. In the current fiscal situation, the immediate solution to&#13;
financial deficiencies in education seems to lie in an intra-sectoral reallocation of the sector budget rather&#13;
than in an increase in the sector share of the national budget.&#13;
3.     This Working Paper examines how resources might be found within the existing budget, to&#13;
strengthen sector management and more effectively furnish the schools with the furniture, equipment,&#13;
materials and supplies as well as the maintenance services that are essential to good teaching.&#13;
4.     Adjustment of Teacherstudent Ratios. There is a widespread tendency to equate high teacher to&#13;
student ratios with high quality in education, although research has shown that teacher: student ratios, except&#13;
at the extremes, bear little relationship to student performance. Examples, in Grenada and elsewhere, show&#13;
that the "best" public schools do not generally have the highest ratios; but they are the best managed.&#13;
5.     The current teacher to student ratios in Grenada are far more generous than those in other countries&#13;
in similar, worse or better economic circumstances' and the Grenada ratios are likely to increase if left&#13;

alone. Furthermore, there appear to be no firn standards--ratios are not now uniform within the school&#13;
system. The current actual average ratios nation-wide are 1:26.8 at primary level and 1:19.3 at secondary.&#13;
However, the breakdown by school in 1994 shows that the range in the primary schools was between 1:8&#13;
and 1:34 and, in the secondary schools, between 1:12.3 and 1:24.42&#13;
6.      It therefore appears necessary for the Ministry to establish realistic standards and then apply them&#13;
judiciousiv. These standards should be flexible, taking into account the special circumstances of small&#13;
schools which, even with multi-grade teaching, clustering and so on, will need higher ratios than large&#13;
schools. A national average ratio of 1:30 at primary level and 1:25 at secondary (1:20 if 6th forms are&#13;
involved) is not unreasonable as a medium term goal, with a longer term (say 10 year) objective of 1:35 and&#13;
1:25 respectively. A ratio of 1:30 overall will still enable the small schools to be taken care of.3&#13;
7.      Decisions on staff:student ratios and the organization of schools and curricula are only part of a&#13;
complex of decisions on delivering educational services, all of which have important financial implications&#13;
when applied system-wide. This complex needs to be carefully thought out and based on policies and&#13;
standards arrived at carefully and in full awareness of the financial-cum-educational implications. The&#13;
system-wide financial impact of even small changes in ratios is considerable. Schools should therefore be&#13;
(a) guided on their staffing needs in view of the limited resources available, (b) helped to use staff&#13;
efficiently and (c) advised on economic altematives in organizing curricula and time-tables. For this crucial&#13;
leadership role, the Ministry needs more trained, senior staff.&#13;
2These are very wide ranges and there is no clear explanation for them. Among the 59 primary schools in March 1994, while the average&#13;
was 1:26.8, on the high side there were schools with 1:8, 1:14, and 1:17 and, on the low side, nine schools with 1:30 or less (i.e. I to 31 and&#13;
32); at the secondary level, there were schools with 12.3, 12.4, 12.7 and 14.5 students per teacher on the one hand and others with 22.5,&#13;
23.0, 23.4, 23.8, and 24.4 students per tacher. Thus, the data at both levels showed ratios about twice as high in the most generously&#13;
staffed school as in the least generously staffed.&#13;
3E.g., for an average nation-wide ratio of 1:31, actual ratios by primary school might be as follows:&#13;

Proposed Sector Budget Adjustment Annex 3, Appendix&#13;
8.      The 1995 budget for salaries constitutes 95.6% of the total Primary sub-sector allocation4 and 95%&#13;
of the Government Secondary School budget. Thus, the availability of funds for other urgent needs of the&#13;
schools--supplies, materials, repairs of physical plant, testing, supervision, training etc.--to provide the&#13;
environment in which principals, teachers and students can perform at an optimal level is seriously&#13;
circumscribed. Shifting funds from salaries to these other school purposes would bring a balanced and&#13;
more productive mix of resources to bear on teaching.&#13;
9.      No drastic measures would be needed in order to achieve that adjustment. A phased reduction in&#13;
ratios would obviate the need to retrench teachers, but it would reduce sharply the recruitrnent of new ones&#13;
over the next few years, unless a major migration of teachers into new openings in the private sector occurs&#13;
to lift attrition rates above the normal three percent. This slowdown in recruitment will provide an&#13;
opportunity for consolidation--to improve the average qualifications of serving teachers and to build higher&#13;
standards of performance. It is important to begin this slowdown in recruitment immediately because the&#13;
primary enrollment is in the process of slow decline which will continue for the next few years.&#13;

11.    As Table I indicates, such an adjustment can yield, by 2000-0 1, some EC$2.17m. in "savings"&#13;
that could be used to:&#13;
(a)     strengthen sector management; and&#13;
(b)     improve direct support to the schools in terms of furniture, equipment, materials and&#13;
supplies and maintenance of physical plant.&#13;
The essential corollary of such saving would be guarantees of equivalent transfers into the school system&#13;
in these productive elements of the system. Without such parallel measures, educational standards will&#13;
decline even further and the frustration levels among the teachers will rise.&#13;
Strengthening Sector Management.&#13;
12.    Although Grenada is a small country, it does need a range of services to conduct a viable&#13;
education system; with careful use of staff, it can afford that range. The additional staff required at Head&#13;
Office to strengthen and improve operations and of estimate of cost are listed in the TABLE.&#13;
5These estimates were calculated on the basis of the April 1995 salaries. No adjustment is made to bring the&#13;
figures in tune with the May 1995 regrading of pay scales. The effect of retaining the pre-regrading salaries is,&#13;
however, negligible in terms of the calculation of impact. Once the overall financial change generated by the&#13;
regrading has been determined, it should be a simple matter of making the required percentage change in the&#13;
figures.&#13;
6   Althought the number of teachers in the Estimates differs from MOE's official data, the average teacher salary&#13;
is a good approximnation of what actually a teacher is paid on an annual basis.&#13;

*Position exists&#13;
13.     The preliminary estimate7 of recurrent cost is EC$ 1.01 million (US$374,300). This would provide&#13;
about 35 more positions, the exact number depending on identifying overlaps with existing staffing and&#13;
rationalizing posts. At least 19 of the technical positions can be filled by persons drawn from the teaching&#13;
service, either to fill a new post or to replace a person promoted to a new post, thus opening up a career to&#13;
them. This expenditure will help eliminate waste and promote efficiency through (i) improved supervision&#13;
and control and (ii) readier design of appropriate policies to deal with emerging situations. It will&#13;
simultaneously build the infrastructure for sustained sector reform and development. The work of these&#13;
units would be supported by improved and modernized equipping of offices and personnel training. These&#13;
measures should raise the productivity of the management as well as the level of efficiency in the schools.&#13;

* In these years, investment in supplies and maintenance will be coming from the project and the Ministry's regular budget.&#13;
(see Table 4)&#13;
15.    The current per student allocations would be raised. This would be done gradually in order to&#13;
permit management capacity and institutional procedures to be built up in procuring and managing the&#13;
goods and services to be provided. The project would assist in this capacity building by absorbing of the&#13;
existing Stores and Supplies and the Maintenance Units into the PMU where they would be better supported&#13;
professionally, and better equipped to undertake sector-wide procurement of furniture, equipment, materials&#13;
and supplies and the maintenance of buildings and equipment. The adjustment being proposed here would&#13;
assure them of regular recurrent funding.&#13;
16.    The funding in 1993-94 was, and by the year 2000 is projected to be, as follows:&#13;
Table 3/B&#13;

18.     The adjustment will have an important impact both on the MOE and national recurrent budgets&#13;
and on the overall public service establishment. Table 5 presents the projected evolution of the sector&#13;
budget; this will need to be refined in the light of (a) some rationalizing of existing posts and duties and&#13;
(b) the proposed long range plan that will be prepared under the project. Under this set of projections,&#13;
with modest annual growth rates in some sub-sectors--skills training (10%), tertiary (2%) and Pre-&#13;
Primary and Special Education (5%)--the overall growth of the sector can be accommodated within&#13;
about 16-17% of the national recurrent budget, assuming that the latter grows at about 2% per annum.&#13;
The sector share would decline from  16.6%  in 1995 to 16.1%  in 2000.8&#13;
5These projections accept much of the status quo in the system. This should not be taken to mean that all of this is endorsed. For&#13;
example, the proposed secondary school study that will be undertaken in September-October of 1995 will doubtless result in&#13;
recommendations touching the budget for the sub-sector.&#13;

19.    The adjustment will increase the posts at the Head Office of MOE, subject to the refining of the&#13;
structure and procedures that is expected to be completed under the proposed project. However, it would&#13;
reduce, rather than increase, the number of public service posts generally. The total number of posts&#13;
directly affected by the adjustment would be as shown in Table 6.&#13;

IL This total includes 11 persons skilled in construction trades who work full time in the schools maintenance Unit&#13;
who should be phased out or transferred to Ministry of Works leaving MOE to contract for these services where they&#13;
are needed. For the purposes of this table, however, these posts are retained.&#13;
Minor increases in posts should occur in the pre primary, skills training, tertiary and special education.&#13;
20.    Despite the increase in the number of central administration positions, the overall sector&#13;
establishment would decline by some 111 positions over the five year period. This decline would&#13;
produce benefits in the labor market, since it releases funds for improved supplies of educational&#13;
materials to schools and maintenance services that will stimulate activity in the construction industry, the&#13;
book trade and other distributive trades; however, these additional employment opportunities cannot be&#13;
quantified at this stage.&#13;
21.    The adjustment program would therefore produce the following important benefits:&#13;
(a)     it will provide for better planning and for more efficient management and accountability&#13;
of a sector that absorbs an appreciable share of the national budget;&#13;
(b)     while maintaining teacher to student ratios at a reasonable and affordable level, it would&#13;
lead to a more productive use of available resources through improved provision of&#13;
educational materials, regular maintenance of school facilities and enhanced training,&#13;
supervision and technical support of teachers in curricula, testing and materials; it would&#13;
also rationalize the teacher to students ratios across schools and eliminate inequities;&#13;
(c)     the overall burden of the sector on the national budget would be maintained at its current&#13;
level or slightly reduced, and&#13;
(d)     it would be in line with the Government's effort to reduce the public personnel&#13;
establishment and stimulate private sector development and job creation.&#13;

2Includes one for library and Remedial Reading. Bearing in mind current practice and the desired goals in regard to&#13;
teacher to student ratios, the school should be allowed approximately the following staff as the intake grows:&#13;
Year I--8 teachers (105 students); Year 2-- 13 teachers (210 students); Year 3-- 17 teachers (315 students);&#13;
Year 4--21 teachers (420 students) and Year 5-21 teachers (525 students). If more students for example&#13;
CXC repeaters from other schools are admitted in the early years (recognizing that the whole school has&#13;
been constructed by 1997), additional staff should be employed; however, in order to avoid retrenchment,&#13;
the ratio should not exceed I teacher to 25 students.&#13;

Annex 6 Appendix: Estimated Recurrent Costs&#13;
GRENADA&#13;
BASIC EDUCATION REFORM PROJECT&#13;
Estimate of Incremental Recurrent Costs Generated by the Project&#13;
(excluding Debt service)&#13;
1.    Incremental recurrent costs would be generated by the project by the year 2000 in regard to:&#13;
(a)    new positions in the MOE Establishment and related travel and office and general&#13;
expenses;&#13;
(b)   increased allowances for materials and supplies and for operations and maintenance in&#13;
primary and secondary schools;&#13;
(c)    operating expenditures for the additional 665 secondary school places comprising (i)&#13;
teacher salaries, (ii) non-teacher salaries, and (iii) non-sairy expenditure;&#13;
(d)    additional costs of maintaining the equipment and furniture supplied under the project,&#13;
and&#13;
(e)    maintennce cost for new secondary chool building provided under the project.&#13;
No increases are calculated for the maintenance of the new MOE building or for the relocated primary&#13;
schools because the existing structures in use generate more maintenance requirements than the proposed&#13;
new ones. Nor are increases calculated for the Planning Division of the Ministry of Finance as the two&#13;
fellowships are assumed to be existing staff.&#13;
2.    The Appendix to Annex 3 sets out the recurrent cost implications of the adjustment of&#13;
teacher to student ratios and the transfer of savings to other purposes. As Table 4 of that&#13;
Appendix shows, items listed in paragraph 1 above that are accommodated within the anticipated&#13;
savings are: (a); (b);(c)(i);(c)(iii); and (e)&#13;
3.    Costs estimated for the items that have not been covered by the savings are as follows:&#13;
(1) non-teacher salaries at Westerhall -EC$45,000 and&#13;
(2) maintenance of new office equipment and furniture - EC$ 125,000&#13;
This total of EC$170,000 is offset by the excess of savings (EC$259,000) shown in Table 4 of&#13;
the Appendix to Annex 3.&#13;
80&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6 Appendix: Estimated Recurrent Costs&#13;
4.    Consequently, no net incremental recurrent cost is anticipated as a result of the project&#13;
and the adjustmnent program. as table 5 of the appendix to annex 3 shows, the MOE budget is&#13;
expected to rise over the project implementation period at a rate slower than that of the expected&#13;
increase in the national budget and these increases in the MOE budget are not attributable to the&#13;
project.&#13;

GRENADA: BASIC EDUCATION REFORM PROJECT&#13;
MONITORING AND EVALUATION INDICATORS&#13;
Introduction:&#13;
Monitoring and evaluation (M &amp; E) will include both the achievement of specific targets and objectives (mainly&#13;
monitoring) and the realization of results or outcomes (more generally, evaluation). As there are no precise indicators or&#13;
benchmarks of quality and institutional development, imperfect and subjective indicators will need to be used where necessary.&#13;
Section I concerns monitoring of progress as indicated by physical land tangible measures. This represents a summary&#13;
of the detailed Implementation Chart which would be prepared by the PMU for the overall project showing the timing of each&#13;
stage of each task and component.&#13;
Section 2 concerns performance on costs. This requires data from Project Accountant who would have the costs broken&#13;
down by the various categories of expenditure: civil works, professional fees, furniture, equipment, materials and supplies,&#13;
fellowships, experts, training, studies, etc. Again the periodic reporting would merely present a summary of detailed picture.&#13;
Whereas sections I and 2 are designed to draw attention to trends that may need to be addressed, section 3 relates to&#13;
evaluative fragments of a more summative character that should be contributed by both the PMU and the beneficiaries of the&#13;
components.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Basic Education Reform Project has
            the overall objective of accelerating human resource
            development to ensure that the requisite manpower exists to
            attain the desired economic transition in Dominica. The
            project is intended to: 1) strengthen the planning and
            institutional capacity of the Ministry of Education, Youth
            Affairs and Sports (MOE) to guide and carry out the
            long-term development of the sector, while enabling it to
            initiate significant, urgent measures to address system-wide
            qualitative problems and expansion needs at the secondary
            level; and 2) serve as a catalyst for a major adjustment
            process, focused on revision to more reasonable levels of
            primary and secondary teacher to student ratios, in line
            with ratios of countries of comparable economic and social
            development. The project comprises three major components:
            1) a strengthening management and planning component; 2) a
            qualitative improvement of basic education component, which
            will enhance the quality of teaching and learning; and 3) an
            expansion and conservation of school places component, which
            will assist MOE to provide more secondary school places in
            the most under-served districts to reduce long distance
            travel and facilitate access to educational opportunities.
