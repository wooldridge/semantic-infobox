            Multi-utilities : trends
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The prospects of cost savings, increased
            market share, and other competitive advantages are prompting
            more, and more utilities to cross traditional industry
            lines, and offer services in several sectors. The note
            reviews the changes occurred during the last two decades,
            when deregulation, and private sector development raised the
            quality, and expansion of utility services, opportunities
            enhanced by technological developments, particularly in the
            field of information, and communications technology, all
            conducive to a multi-utility strategy. Horizontal
            integration of infrastructure services occurred both at the
            wholesale, and retail (distribution) levels: energy
            companies at the wholesale level are seeking to leverage
            trading skills between the gas, and electricity sectors;
            and, at the retail level, multi-utility strategies have
            taken the form of either leveraging the physical
            infrastructure as a conduit for a range of services, or are
            integrating separate utilities under the same corporate
            umbrella. Thus integration of physical networks, of service,
            and corporate, although not yet clearly defined, will strive
            to capture the potential advantages of offering two, or more
            utility service. However, even if integration makes sense,
            certainly unforeseen policy, and regulatory implications
            will need to respond and safeguard public interests, without
            stifling innovation.
