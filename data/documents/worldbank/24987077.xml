        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Russia’s economy contracted 4.6 percent
            in the second quarter, year-on-year, after a 2.2 percent
            contraction in the first quarter, but in June the pace of
            contraction slowed. Russia’s second quarter balance of
            payment remained stable despite a weaker trade balance as
            the current account improved and capital outflows moderated.
            Receding oil prices and a further cut in the key policy
            rates in July brought the ruble exchange rate down to its
            lowest level since February. Preliminary poverty statistics
            for the first quarter of 2015 show a significant increase in
            the number of poor people.
