Healthy, dynamic cities are an integral part of sustained                   where land prices are often 50 to 100 times higher than&#13;
economic growth (box 6.1).1 As countries develop, cities                    they are 30 or 40 miles away? Why do so many indi-&#13;
account for an ever-increasing share of national income.                    viduals and firms settle in large metropolitan areas&#13;
Urban areas generate 55 percent of gross national prod-                     where the cost of living is typically twice as high as it is&#13;
uct (GNP) in low-income countries, 73 percent in                            in smaller urban areas?3 The answer must be that these&#13;
middle-income countries, and 85 percent in high-                            costs are more than offset by the economic benefits&#13;

Regionalism and local economic development: lessons from Europe&#13;

a. â&#128;&#156;No+â&#128;? indicates that, although the legislature is elected, a nominated executive head (for example, a mayor or governor) holds significant powers. b. State, province,&#13;
region, department, or other elected entity between the local and the national government. c. Municipality or equivalent. d. Subnational fiscal data come from World Bank&#13;
country data and staff calculations. e. The 1996 Local Government Commission recommended a four-tier subnational government system composed (from the bottom up)&#13;
of approximately 85,000 villages; 4,633 unions, and municipalities; 460 thanas and upazilas; and 64 zilas. Parliament has passed the upazila council bill, and elections are&#13;
scheduled for 1999; the zila council bill had not been passed as of June 1999. Elected local government currently exists only at the municipal level, composed of 4,500&#13;
union parishads in rural areas, 129 pourashavas, or smaller municipalities, and 4 city corporations. f. A law passed in 1998 allows for elections at the commune level, but&#13;
elections have not yet taken place. g. Bosnia and Herzegovina is divided into a federation and the Republika Srpska, with two substate levels within the federation&#13;
(10 cantons and 73 municipalities), but only one in the Republika Srpska (64 municipalities). h. Local elections are planned for late 1999 or early 2000. A law is being&#13;
drafted to define the powers and responsibilities of elected commune councils. i. Heads of local government are currently appointed, although this is slated to change in&#13;
1999. j. Villages elect representatives, who represent them at the district level and in turn elect a provincial parliament. The provincial governor is appointed by the head of&#13;
state. Eritrea is in the process of changing its constitution, which could modify this system. k. Local government consists of 3,609 urban local bodies and, in rural areas,&#13;
474 zila parishads, which wield some authority over the 5,906 panchayats samithis, which in turn have some authority over the 227,698 gram panchayats. It is therefore not&#13;
strictly correct to aggregate these into one level of local authority. l. A 1998 revision of the constitution allows for six provinces and an unspecified number of regions, in&#13;
addition to the existing municipalities. Only the municipalities currently have sitting elected governments. m. Malawi has a local government administration, but no elected&#13;
local government has been in place for several years. Local elections are expected in October 1999. n. Local elections have been held infrequently, and local governments are&#13;
established by provincial governments. o. The three tiers are the 16 gminas, 368 powiats, and 2,365 municipalities. p. Portugal also has 4,207 submunicipalities as a second&#13;
tier of elected local government. q. At the intermediate level the country is divided into 26 states, some of which have elected governors, whereas others have nominated&#13;
governors. r. The assemblies of the oblasts (provinces) and rains (districts) are elected, but their heads are nominated by the president. At the jamoat, or community, level,&#13;
the local governing authority is elected at a general meeting of the residents. s. Thailand currently has elected municipal governments governing 149 cities. In addition there&#13;
are 1,050 sanitary districts, which provide services in densely populated areas outside cities. Each is governed by a board composed of appointed and elected members;&#13;
983 of these districts will soon be upgraded to municipality status. There are up to 7,823 tambon administrative organizations, which provide basic services in rural areas&#13;
and are governed by elected assemblies and appointed executives. The 1997 constitution mandates that executives and councils of local authorities be largely elected. These&#13;
changes are expected to be completed by October 1999, in which case the country would still have only one tier of elected local government but close to 8,955 fully elected&#13;
local governments. t. Not all mayors are elected; about 10 are appointed. u. Appointed khokims (governors or mayors) exercise almost unlimited power in oblasts and rayons,&#13;
with quasi-elected councils having very limited authority.&#13;

            The theme of this 22nd edition of the
            World Development Report is the changing development
            landscape in the 21st century. The Report focuses on two
            forces of change: the integration of the world economy and
            the increasing demand for self-government which will affect
            responses to key issues such as poverty reduction, climate
            change, and water scarcity. These tidal forces of
            globalization and localization will require nation states to
            sustain a dynamic equilibrium with international and
            subnational partners. The nature of this equilibrium will
            have far reaching implications for the gains from trade and
            capital flows, the fruitfulness of global environmental
            agreements, the pace of regional growth and the scope of
            urban development. The Report proposes new rules and
            structures on which to build a comprehensive approach to
            development policy in the 21st century. The challenges
            remain great, but the opportunities available in the new
            century hold out prospects for a better future. The World
            Development Report 1999/2000 provides invaluable guidance
            for decisionmakers in the next century. It gives an in-depth
            analysis of evolving development concerns and explains how
            current views must adapt to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
