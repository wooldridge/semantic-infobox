1. THE ENERGY SECTOR AND THE POWER SUBSECTOR&#13;
A. THE ENERGY SECTOR&#13;
The Economic Setting&#13;
1.1   Uruguay is small in both area (176,320 sq. kilometers) and population (3.15 million)&#13;
with a good level of socioeconomic development. Per capita income (US$3,910 in 1993) is&#13;
above the Latin American average, and income distribution compares favorably with that of&#13;
many developed countries. The population is mostly urban (87 percent) and well educated.&#13;
1.2   However, despite the legacy of prosperity in the early 1900s, Uruguay's economic&#13;
performance over the past four decades has fallen short of its potential. This is largely&#13;
because of insufficient savings and capital investment. There was good growth briefly in the&#13;
late 1970s in the wake of strong foreign fund inflows, which were unfortunately more&#13;
associated with external debt accumulation than equity investments. As a result, Uruguay&#13;
underwent a wrenching recession in the 1980s when the foreign inflow was reversed and the&#13;
country had to service massive interest obligations. Although domestic savings subsequently&#13;
increased, gross fixed investment remained low. This has accelerated the erosion of&#13;
Uruguay's capital stock, which has long been inadequately maintained, and has contributed to&#13;
the pattern of recurrent low GDP growth. The latter averaged less than 1 % between 1988&#13;
and 1990, and then increased to 2.9% in 1991, 7.4% in 1992, fell to 1.5% in 1993, and&#13;
grew to 4.2% in 1994. The high growth in 1992 was fueled by strong capital inflows that&#13;
helped finance a significant expansion of consumption and imports, as well as demand&#13;
pressures from Argentina and Brazil, which still persist.&#13;
1.3   A recent Bank study (Uruguay-Private Sector Assessment-Report No. 11648-UR, June&#13;
18, 1993) found that unreliable power supply, inadequate transport facilities, poor&#13;
communications between major cities and generally unsatisfactory trade facilitation and&#13;
logistics are undermining Uruguay's private sector development. The Government has set&#13;
about to overcome these deficiencies, recognizing that their early mitigation would be&#13;
particularly timely. Uruguay is well positioned to become a successful open economy.&#13;
Implementation of the MERCOSUR agreement (a common market among Argentina, Brazil,&#13;
Paraguay and Uruguay) could intensify Uruguay's economic links with its neighbors, to&#13;
which it is already quite vulnerable. Nevertheless, on balance, increased access to the&#13;
MERCOSUR market, which has a combined output of over US$500 billion and almost 200&#13;
million people, could become a constructive factor in Uruguay's future growth. This applies&#13;
particularly to the expansion of the service sector, as well as the possibilities of exploitation&#13;
of regional energy market prospects. To a considerable extent, the realization of this&#13;
opportunity depends on making the country's power distribution system more reliable,&#13;
especially in the light of the possible expanded trade opportunities within MERCOSUR.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
Energy Resources&#13;
1.4   Uruguay's energy resources are limited, and the country has to rely on oil imports to&#13;
cover a significant share (55%) of its energy requirements. Hydropower resources are, by&#13;
and large, already used (88% of all possible hydropotential is utilized), and the remaining&#13;
potential hydro capacity (12%) is not economic to develop at present fuel prices. Thus&#13;
immediate power demand will need to be met by energy conservation, thermal installations,&#13;
and eventual power exchange with neighboring countries. Over the last twenty years&#13;
Uruguay has maintained adequate pricing for power and oil derivatives plus additional&#13;
conservation measures, have reduced the percentage share of oil in its energy consumption.&#13;
Electricity rates have been kept in line with cost-of-living adjustments, and are based on&#13;
marginal cost principles.&#13;
Energy Consumption&#13;
1.5   Total energy consumption in 1992 was 2,052,000 TOE (Tons of Oil Equivalent),&#13;
resulting in 0.649 TOE per capita, an adequate level when compared with other countries at&#13;
a similar stage of development. Total energy consumption has varied in accordance with&#13;
economic growth. During the recession of 1980-85, it fell by 3.5% per year compared to a&#13;
3.7% per year decline for GDP, and in 1985-91, it grew 2.3% compared to a 3.4% growth&#13;
in GDP. The energy demand is concentrated in few sectors with, residential representing&#13;
37% of total demand, followed by industrial 29%, transportation 27%, and agriculture with&#13;
only 7%. Annex 1 shows the participation of each sector in total energy demand, as well as&#13;
the participation of the different sources of energy to supply the demand. This annex shows&#13;
the importance of oil imports in the Uruguayan economy. To be able to serve future energy&#13;
requirements, Uruguay needs to develop a strategy of Energy Options. Such a study is under&#13;
way, as described in para. 1.13 and in Annex 3.&#13;
Energy Sector Organization&#13;
1.6   The Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mines (MIE) is responsible for long range&#13;
planning, sector policy setting, and supervision of the state-controlled companies in the&#13;
sector. At present the sector is monopolistic. The most important operating entities are the&#13;
National Petroleum Company (Administraci6n Nacional de Combustibles, Alcohol y Portland&#13;
- ANCAP) and the National Power Company (Administraci6n Nacional de Usinas y&#13;
Trasmisiones Electricas - UTE).&#13;
1.7   The Government (with Bank support) is reorganizing the energy sector. Based on&#13;
studies funded by Loan 3517-0-UR (Public Enterprise Reform Loan, PERL), the Government&#13;
has created an Energy Technical Commission (Comisi6n Tecnica de Energfa - CTE)&#13;
composed of representatives of the Ministers of Mines and Energy, Economy and the&#13;
Director of the Planning and Budget Office (OPP) to give technical support to the&#13;
Government on regulatory issues and on tariff setting. The Ministry of Mines and Energy,&#13;
through the Direcci6n Nacional de Energfa (DNE) with the support of CTE, would enforce&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
regulation. A new regulatory system will be created to open sector activities to market&#13;
forces where possible. Measures contemplated would include the transfer to the private&#13;
sector of the gas distribution system of Montevideo, private participation in some areas of oil&#13;
distribution, private investments in power generation to compete with UTE, and private in&#13;
distribution of electricity to certain areas of the country.&#13;
B. THE POWER SUBSECTOR&#13;
Institutional Characteristics&#13;
1.8   UTE was established in 1912 as the sole entity responsible for power generation,&#13;
transmission, and retail distribution of electricity in the country. The scope of UTE's&#13;
services is prescribed in the National Electricity Law (NEL) and UTE's by-laws. The NEL&#13;
establishes the general regulation of generation, distribution, exports and imports of&#13;
electricity. In October 1991, law #16211 was enacted to allow the participation of private&#13;
investors in generation activities, but their participation in the sector has been very small&#13;
because of the lack of adequate and specific detailed regulation of the general principles&#13;
defined in the law. The new regulatory system being implemented (see para. 1. 11) will&#13;
address this issue. A Presidential Decree enacted on November 7, 1994, has removed from&#13;
UTE all regulatory power it previously had. This Decree created the Energy Technical&#13;
Commission (see para. 1.7), transferring to it the responsibilities of giving the adequate&#13;
technical support to the Government in defining tariff levels and enforcing regulations. A&#13;
new regulatory framework defining transparent regulations favoring competition in power&#13;
generation is to be implemented shortly (see para. 1.12).&#13;
1.9   UTE is an autonomous public entity (its Board of Directors is appointed by the&#13;
Government) reporting to the MIE. Its budget is approved by the Planning and Budget&#13;
Office (OPP), which imposes ceilings on investments and expenditures. The Government&#13;
auditing agency (Tribunal de Cuentas) is responsible for ensuring that UTE complies with&#13;
budget and procurement legislation.&#13;
1.10  The only other entity that now operates in the power sector is the "Comisi6n Tecnica&#13;
Mixta del Salto Grande (CTM). " CTM is a binational entity owned by the governments of&#13;
Uruguay and Argentina in charge of the operation of the Salto Grande hydro power plant&#13;
(1890 MW). CTM's board is composed of five Argentine and five Uruguayan members, all&#13;
appointed by their respective governments.&#13;
Power Subsector Reform&#13;
1.11 The Government is restructuring the sector in order to promote private investment in&#13;
new generation plants, with the Government increasingly playing a subsidiary role in&#13;
investments, while strengthening its regulatory functions in areas where a natural monopoly&#13;
exists. These reforms intend to: (i) remove from UTE all responsibility for policy&#13;
formulation, power planning, and regulatory functions; (ii) define a clear concession regime&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
for private sector investments in competitive power generation; and (iii) create a new&#13;
regulatory system to balance protection of the public interest with the need for enterprise&#13;
autonomy, including the setting of tariffs in accordance with clear rules for their calculation.&#13;
1.12  Studies prepared by consultants (under Loan 3517-0-UR - PERL), and reviewed by&#13;
the Bank propose the aforementioned new arrangement for the power subsector: a&#13;
competitive market for power generation. UTE would be separated into three business units&#13;
(Generation, Transmission and Distribution) with different accounting systems and&#13;
transparency of cost allocation among them. Larger consumers will be free to buy energy&#13;
from any generator. Transmission access will be open. Annex 2 gives additional details on&#13;
the new regulatory system. As a condition of negotiations of the proposed loan, the&#13;
Government enacted a Presidential Decree (on November 7, 1994), removing from UTE all&#13;
its regulatory power (see para. 1.8) and creating the Energy Technical Commission to give&#13;
the technical support to the government in its regulatory actions. A new regulatory system&#13;
was designed based on the aforementioned consultant studies and would be put in place as&#13;
one condition of effectiveness of this Loan. In addition, the proposed project would support&#13;
the implementation of these modifications in accordance with Bank policy for the sector, and&#13;
would allow the dialogue with the Government on this issue to be maintained.&#13;
Power Subsector Policies&#13;
1.13 Power subsector policies are defined by MIE as part of the overall energy policy of&#13;
the Government. An energy options study under preparation and funded under Loan 3517-0-&#13;
UR is intended to recommend an energy strategy with different scenarios for primary energy&#13;
sources (natural gas, oil and coal) to generate future electricity requirements. It will also&#13;
consider power exchange with Argentina and Brazil through existing and possible future&#13;
interconnections (see Annex 3). It will be a strategy paper, not an investment plan. The&#13;
consulting firm to carry out the study has already being selected. The Government has&#13;
launched the study as a condition of negotiations of the proposed loan. When the Energy&#13;
Options Study is completed, the Government and the Bank will jointly review its conclusions,&#13;
in order to provide technical support to the Government on different strategies for&#13;
incorporating the study results into the planning of future power sector development.&#13;
Electricity Pricing&#13;
1.14 The National Electricity Law defines the tariff regime in Uruguay. It provides that&#13;
tariffs be set on basis of a target rate of return (not lower than 6%) on a rate base consisting&#13;
of average revalued net assets in operation plus a provision for working capital. The tariff&#13;
structure also differentiates tariff levels to customers at different consumption levels and&#13;
different voltage levels of supply to reflect the cost of supplying electricity to them. The&#13;
present average tariff level is 8.9 US cents/kWh, which is equal to the long-range marginal&#13;
cost (LRMC). The LRMC was calculated as part of an independent study (financed under&#13;
the Fifth Power Project, Loan 1779-UR) completed in 1982 and recently updated by UTE.&#13;
As part of the preparation of this project, a consultant assessed the results of the LRMC&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
study and carried out an analysis of the taxation and subsidies included in electricity prices&#13;
(see Annex 4). The conclusions of this Energy Pricing Study concerning the power sector&#13;
are: (i) electricity prices are currently about equal to marginal costs; (ii) UTE has a&#13;
competent staff able to deal with tariff questions and qualified to undertake marginal cost&#13;
analyses; (iii) electricity tariffs are correctly structured according to costs, and subsidies are&#13;
non-existent; (iv) the tariff system could be improved by incorporating a seasonality element&#13;
to reflect higher energy costs during winter; (v) the tariff studies could be improved through&#13;
the implementation of the conclusions of a load characteristics study under way; and (vi) the&#13;
institutional reform under implementation should not jeopardize the current electricity pricing&#13;
structure.&#13;
1.15 The conclusions and recommendations of the Energy Pricing Study were taken into&#13;
account in the preparation of the project. The Decree creating the new institutional structure&#13;
was drafted in consultation with the Bank, and the reforms will not jeopardize the current&#13;
electricity pricing structure. During negotiations agreement was reached with UTE to&#13;
include in the proposed project: (i) a load characteristics study in accordance with terms of&#13;
reference (TOR) satisfactory to the Bank (see Attachment 1 to Annex 11), whose results&#13;
would be included in future LRMC studies and would be the basis for UTE's demand side&#13;
management actions; and (ii) a marginal cost tariff study to update previous estimates&#13;
(utilizing the results of the load curve study; see para. 1. 17), aiming to analyze the effects of&#13;
possible different costs of electricity during the different seasons of the year (see Attachment&#13;
1 to Annex 11).&#13;
Demand Side Management&#13;
1.16 UTE offers a time-of-day metering system with different tariff levels to promote&#13;
demand side management. This system was first offered in 1986 to larger consumers (above&#13;
100 MWh per month and contracted capacity over 200 kW), which amounts to around 17%&#13;
of electricity consumption of the country. They were offered three different tariff levels&#13;
depending on time of consumption (peak tariff, from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m., night tariff, from 12&#13;
a.m. to 7 a.m., and valley tariff, from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. and from 10 p.m. to 12 a.m.). In&#13;
1992 this tariff system was extended to medium consumers (contracted capacity over 20&#13;
kW). More recently (in 1993), UTE implemented a two level time-of-day tariff scheme&#13;
(peak and off-peak) for commercial and residential consumers. The Bank has been&#13;
monitoring this implementation, which began with marginal cost studies (under Loan 1779-&#13;
UR - Fifth Power Project), and continued with the acquisition of special meters (under Loan&#13;
2484-UR - Power Engineering Loan). This new system improves load management, which&#13;
reduces peak loads and allows customers to benefit from lower off-peak tariffs.&#13;
1.17 The most basic objective of the aforementioned new time-of-day tariff system is to&#13;
promote demand-side management by transferring load from peak to off-peak periods, thus&#13;
improving energy efficiency. UTE is also conducting a load curve study (financed under&#13;
Loan 3221-UR), aiming to obtain the daily load curve for different classes of consumers to&#13;
guide additional actions for efficient use of electricity. The proposed project would finance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
the continuation of this study to help UTE take the necessary actions to improve its load&#13;
curve (para. 1.15). In addition, UTE would begin a program for more efficient use of&#13;
electricity by its consumers. The proposed project would finance technical assistance (see&#13;
para. 3.4) to help UTE prepare and implement a Demand-side Management Program based&#13;
on the results of the load curve study, and including actions to improve electricity efficiency&#13;
(see terms of reference in Attachment 1 to Annex 11). Together with the Energy Options&#13;
Study (see para. 1.13), this will allow UTE to develop aii adequate Integrated Resource&#13;
Planning System. During negotiations, it was agreed that UTE would implement a&#13;
satisfactory Demand-side Management Program. The program would be submitted to the&#13;
Bank six months after the conclusion of the load characteristics study, and would be based on&#13;
its results.&#13;
Power Market and Facilities&#13;
1.18 The degree of electrification in Uruguay is high (97%) compared to the average of&#13;
70% for Latin American countries. Historically, UTE has operated and maintained its&#13;
generating facilities satisfactorily. The generating installed capacity (including the&#13;
participation in Salto Grande) is 1823 MW, of which 1241 MW is hydroelectric and 582&#13;
MW thermoelectric.  Since the oil crisis of 1973, the share of hydroelectric generation in&#13;
the total has increased, and today represents about 90% of total generation in years of&#13;
average hydrological conditions.&#13;
1.19  UTE's 500-kV transmission system is interconnected to the Salto Grande hydroplant.&#13;
This has allowed UTE to sell electricity to the Argentine market, and consequently to take&#13;
advantage of the competitive environment created by the new regulatory system in Argentina.&#13;
During 1992 UTE sold 2,268 GWh to Argentina, resulting in net earnings of US$91.8&#13;
million; sales in 1993 were 1450 GWh, and net earnings, US$44.1 million. In addition to&#13;
the commercial benefits, this interconnection has also shown the Uruguayan authorities the&#13;
benefits of a modern regulatory framework (as it exists in Argentina), stimulating them to&#13;
promote in Uruguay the modifications that are now underway (see para. 1.12).&#13;
1.20 The domestic power market in Uruguay has shown increasing electricity consumption,&#13;
with annual growth of 5.7% over the past four years. Total sales of electricity in 1994 were&#13;
4655 Gwh. Montevideo concentrates 52.3% of the sales and the interior responds for&#13;
47.7%. Sales to residential customers represents 45.9% of total sales, while industrial&#13;
represents 35.7%, commercial 15.9%, and the remaining 2.5% public lighting. Annex 5&#13;
shows consumption of electricity in Uruguay during the past twenty years.&#13;
1.21  Under Loan 1779-UR (Fifth Power Project), consultants developed satisfactory&#13;
methodologies to forecast electricity demand based on trends and regression analysis&#13;
techniques. Using these methodologies, UTE has prepared load demand forecasts (see&#13;
Annex 5). The three main consumer categories -- residential, commercial and industrial --&#13;
were analyzed, assuming an expected population growth of 0.5% a year, the same rate as in&#13;
the previous decade; the same coverage and historic growth for consumption per residential&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7-&#13;
customer; and an annual GDP growth rate of 2 % for the period 1993-2004. The market&#13;
study forecast sales growth from 4527 Gwh in 1993 to 6873 Gwh in 2003, an average annual&#13;
increase of 4.26%, which is consistent with past experience and future expectations. The&#13;
generation requirements were calculated considering that the improvements in the system&#13;
would result in reduction of losses to 13.5% by the year 2000, yielding a growth rate of&#13;
3.6% in generation requirements. UTE has also estimated its future sales in the power spot&#13;
market in Argentina (see Annex 6). The supply options are outlined in para. 1.29-1.32&#13;
below.&#13;
Losses&#13;
1.22 Losses have been at high levels for decades in UTE's system (19% in 1993), due to&#13;
technical and non-technical losses. The high technical losses are concentrated in the&#13;
Montevideo area due to a heavily-loaded transmission system, very old distribution&#13;
installations (some more than 60 years old), inadequate distribution voltage levels for the&#13;
present load magnitude (6 kV as medium distribution voltage), and an inadequate low voltage&#13;
ungrounded system. To address those issues, a Bank-financed study (under Loan 2484-UR -&#13;
Power Engineering Loan) confirmed by an independent study, has recommended the&#13;
complete renovation of the distribution system, including modification of the distribution&#13;
voltage levels and transformation of the low voltage system to a neutral grounded one. The&#13;
complete renovation would be accomplished in four phases of approximately five years each.&#13;
The proposed loan would finance the first phase of this renovation. During the preparation&#13;
of this project, and as part of the ongoing Power Modernization Project (Loan 3221-UR),&#13;
UTE has considerably improved its procedures for maintenance of the distribution system,&#13;
which is now adequate, resulting in reduction of service interruptions to an average of four&#13;
hours compared to 16 hours previously.&#13;
1.23  The non-technical losses result from inadequate accounting of self consumption in&#13;
UTE's own installations, inadequate commercial procedures, and theft of electricity (black&#13;
losses). Under Loan 3221-UR (Power Modernization Project), UTE has modernized its&#13;
commercial operations, reducing the period between meter reading and bill delivery from 45&#13;
days to 24 hours. UTE has also created a new Division (Servicio Tecnico Comercial) to be&#13;
responsible for implementing a program to reduce non-technical losses. During preparation&#13;
of the proposed project, UTE prepared and submitted to the Bank a satisfactory "Non-&#13;
Technical Losses Reduction Program". This program will have four areas of action: (i)&#13;
commercial procedures; (ii) metering control and policy; (iii) theft of energy and direct&#13;
connections; and (iv) accounting for losses. During negotiations UTE agreed to carry out the&#13;
"Non-Technical Losses Reduction Program", as detailed in the agreed Implementation Plan&#13;
(see Attachment 3 to Annex 12).&#13;
1.24 The first area of the program for reduction of non-technical losses (commercial&#13;
procedures) has already been implemented. It included the modification and modernization&#13;
of all commercial procedures from metering to bill delivery. Under Loan 3221-UR,&#13;
supported by a twinning agreement with Uni6n-Fenosa from Spain, UTE introduced a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8-&#13;
completely new commercial system, eliminating all previous procedures. Today a customer&#13;
can have all commercial activities perforned by telephone. All meter recording is now&#13;
performed with the help of portable computer equipment, which automatically indicates any&#13;
meter-reading error, and reduces the time for issuing the bills. This new system has been&#13;
operating successfully for more than a year. The results are impressive, and have helped&#13;
change UTE's image to its customers and to the general public.&#13;
1.25 The second element of the program (metering problems) aims at auditing the metering&#13;
facilities to detect meter malfunctions and theft of electricity by meter tampering. It also&#13;
aims at creating within UTE a system for management and supervision of the quality of&#13;
installed meters. A first sampling analysis of the problem was concluded in June 1993 by&#13;
examining 3,824 consumer installations. This study will serve as the basis for the&#13;
recommended actions which are to: (i) create a data bank containing all information on&#13;
installed meters; (ii) create a routine system of replacement and checking of meters; (iii)&#13;
inspect all customer metering installations; (iv) change adulterated or malfunctioning meters;&#13;
(v) seal all metering installations to facilitate future inspections; (vi) carry out a public&#13;
relations campaign to educate consumers; and (vii) create a permanent follow-up of the&#13;
metering situation of the customers. A timetable for these actions is included in the proposed&#13;
Plan of Action (see Attachment 3 to Annex 12).&#13;
1.26 The third area of the program (theft of energy and direct connections) aims to assess&#13;
the areas in which consumers connect their houses to UTE's system directly without the&#13;
company's consent. It will be initiated by a field metering campaign designed to estimate&#13;
the amount of energy lost, and at the same time to identify the areas in which this problem is&#13;
more concentrated. Subsequently, UTE will address the issue in selected areas by contacting&#13;
the consumers to normalize their situation. It will be done gradually and with care due to&#13;
security reasons, since the majority of the cases are expected to be in low-income&#13;
neighborhoods. The agreed plan has details on the actions proposed and a timetable for their&#13;
implementation. Besides direct connections, the program will address the creation of routine&#13;
inspections for regular consumers to avoid by-passes and other forms of tampering.&#13;
1.27  The fourth part of the program (accounting for losses) aims to estimate losses&#13;
adequately by different levels (generation, transmission and distribution) and to account for&#13;
the internal consumption of the power plants and the self-consumption of other UTE&#13;
installations. The agreed program covers: (i) a survey of the electricity metering situation in&#13;
all existing UTE installations; (ii) accounting of the "internal consumption" in all power&#13;
generating plants and of the "self-consumption" in all other UTE installations; (iii) creation&#13;
of a satisfactory methodology and routine for calculation of losses; and (iv) follow-up on the&#13;
evolution of losses in the system.&#13;
1.28 For intensive surveillance on the implementation of the Non-Technical Losses&#13;
Reduction Program, agreement was reached during negotiations that UTE will hire a&#13;
consultant to serve as supervisor of its implementation. The consultant would report to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9-&#13;
Bank and to the UTE General Manager on the progress of the program, in accordance with&#13;
terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank (see Attachment 1 to Annex 11).&#13;
Power Balance&#13;
1.29 Uruguay's current generating capacity (considering 50% of Salto Grande) is 1836&#13;
MW, of which 1241 MW is hydroelectric and 595 MW oil-fired thermal plants.&#13;
Hydrogeneration is supplied by three power plants in the Rio Negro (Gabriel Terra,&#13;
Baygorria and Palmar) and by the Salto Grande binational hidroplant in the Rio Uruguay.&#13;
Thermal generation is supplied by the Batlle y Ordoiiez steam plant (305 MW), La Tablada&#13;
gas turbine plant (227 MW), and by two small gas turbines (BBC and Maldonado).&#13;
1.30 Investments in future generation will have to rely on thermal plants, since the&#13;
economic hydroelectric potential is being used. The energy options study being developed&#13;
will indicate the best fuel source to use in future plants (see para. 1.13). In addition, the&#13;
rehabilitation of old hydroelectric plants should be pursued to extend their economic lives.&#13;
UTE is, therefore, rehabilitating the Gabriel Terra hydroplant, financed under Loan 2622-UR&#13;
(Power Plant Rehabilitation Project), and plans to rehabilitate the Baygorria hydroplant in the&#13;
future.&#13;
1.31 Using computer simulation models for planning and operation of power systems&#13;
(developed by consultants under Loan 2484-UR), UTE has prepared a satisfactory power&#13;
balance study. Annex 6 shows the results of the power balance and of the least-cost&#13;
expansion plan. To adequately meet the load forecast will require the installation of 127&#13;
MW in 1996, and of 190 MW in 1998, of additional thermal capacity. The installed&#13;
capacity during the next decade would then be as follows:&#13;
Installed Capacity (in MW)&#13;
Year        1995  1996  1997  1998  1999  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004&#13;
Total       2106  2223  2223  2363  2363  2363  2363  2363  2363  2363&#13;
Hydro       1511  1511  1511  1511  1511  1511  1511  1511  1511  1511&#13;
Thermal     595   712   712   852   852   852   852   852   852   852&#13;
1.32 To define the best alternative to supply the required additional capacity, UTE has&#13;
contracted the consultant services of Southern Electric International -SEI- (under a grant from&#13;
the US Government). SEI has issued a report analyzing several alternatives and&#13;
recommending: (i) conversion of the La Tablada thermal station to combined cycle by the&#13;
installation of an additional 121-MW new steam turbine generator in 1996; (ii) installation of&#13;
a new 180-MW combined cycle thermal plant at the Batlle y Ordofiez thermal plant in the&#13;
area currently occupied by units 1 and 2 and the boiler house, in 1998; (iii) installation of a&#13;
new 360-MW combined cycle plant at the Greenfield location as an alternative to the&#13;
previous installations if they cannot be done. Recently UTE has decided to rely on private&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
investments for future power generation. Therefore, the installation of an additional 120-&#13;
MW in gas turbines (in 1996 as recommended by the studies) would be done by UTE only if&#13;
the private sector did not show interest in it. Subsequently, UTE plans to call for tenders&#13;
from investors interested in installing the 180-MW combined cycle plant in Batlle y Ordoniez&#13;
as an Independent Power Producer (IPP) to sell its generation to UTE. These decisions are&#13;
reflected in UTE's proposed investment plan (see para 2.22), and in the financial projections&#13;
(see para 2.17).&#13;
Lessons from Bankwide Lending to the Power Subsector&#13;
1.33 The Bank has been involved in power subsector reform in several countries. Matters&#13;
of a general nature, as well as specific aspects relative to reforms in Uruguay, have been&#13;
analyzed using lessons drawn from Bank experience in implementation of recent power sector&#13;
reforms in several countries in Latin America. The Bank is helping the Uruguayan&#13;
Government to modify the regulatory framework of the power sector. The new structure&#13;
will introduce a transparent regulatory system separating the past dual role of Government as&#13;
operator and owner of the sole power utility in the country. Government will retain its&#13;
responsibilities for setting objectives, articulating overall policies, coordinating sector&#13;
development and regulation. Regulatory rules will define the procedures for reducing the&#13;
level of Government involvement in operations and increasing the accountability of enterprise&#13;
managers. It will also define entry and exit conditions for private power producers. The&#13;
Bank's new policies for the power sector have been followed in the preparation of this&#13;
project, which will permit a transfer to Uruguay of the experience the Bank has acquired in&#13;
its involvement in others countries.&#13;
Lessons from Previous Projects for the Power Subsector in Uruguay&#13;
1.34 The Bank has made eight loans to Uruguay's power subsector; the first six are fully&#13;
disbursed and the projects satisfactorily completed. There was a nine-year hiatus in Bank&#13;
lending to the sector between the fourth and fifth power projects, because of difficulties in&#13;
reaching agreement with the Government on measures to restore the sector to a sound&#13;
institutional and financial situation. Restoration of the power sector took place under a key&#13;
Bank intervention through the Fifth Power Project (Loan 1779-UR signed in March 1980).&#13;
Under this project the Bank recommended measures to strengthen the sector and irnprove the&#13;
performance of UTE. As a consequence, the Government passed a National Electricity Law,&#13;
changed UTE's bylaws, and relieved UTE of its responsibility for telephone services. The&#13;
most recent project (Loan 2484-UR - Power Engineering Loan) was completed in November&#13;
1990. The Project Completion Report (No. 12837, dated March 11, 1994), indicates as a&#13;
lesson learned that at appraisal the Bank should have carefully reviewed the process to be&#13;
followed for the selection of consultants as well as the procurement of goods by the&#13;
borrower. This would have uncovered the convoluted procedures of Uruguayan procurement&#13;
laws, and might have expedited the process, e.g., by preparing the documentation in&#13;
advance, by issuing standard bidding documents or by establishing a more realistic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
implementation schedule. The lessons learned were followed during the preparation of the&#13;
proposed project.&#13;
1.35 Two ongoing projects are funded by Bank loans: the Power Sector Rehabilitation&#13;
Project (funded by Loan 2622-UR, an associated Loan from commercial banks guaranteed by&#13;
the Bank, and French cofinancing) and the Power Modernization Project (funded by Loan&#13;
3221-UR and US Eximbank cofinancing). The Power Sector Rehabilitation Project has been&#13;
delayed four years due to slowness in starting project implementation. Several reasons&#13;
contributed to the initial delay of this project. It took 18 months for the Government and the&#13;
international banking community to conclude the negotiations of the B-Loan associated with&#13;
the Bank loan. The complexity of the works to be carried out in rehabilitating a power plant&#13;
in operation also caused additional delays in preparation of the bidding documents. Finally,&#13;
delays also occurred when the borrower realized that additional financing for the&#13;
rehabilitation of the Gabriel Terra power plant was needed and French cofinancing was&#13;
negotiated. The project is now progressing satisfactorily with the works under the B-Loan&#13;
(Transmission and Distribution) scheduled to be completed in 1996 and the works under&#13;
Loan 2622-UR (Gabriel Terra Rehabilitation) scheduled to be completed in December 1997.&#13;
As agreed during preparation of the proposed project, the works for rehabilitation of first&#13;
unit of Gabriel Terra Hydroplant began on January 6, 1994, as a condition for departure of&#13;
the pre-appraisal mission. The first unit is already rehabilitated and back to commercial&#13;
operation and UTE is currently rehabilitating the second unit. All contracts for goods and&#13;
works for this ongoing project (Loan 2622-UR and the associated B-Loan) have already been&#13;
awarded, except for two contracts which should be awarded soon.&#13;
1.36  The Power Modernization Project (Loan 3221-UR) began on time and is on schedule&#13;
to be completed by 1997. In the preparation of that Loan the Bank used the lessons learned&#13;
in the previous project. Both the procurement of the main component (a thernal plant) and&#13;
the cofinancing were carried out in advance, resulting in the thermal plant being put into&#13;
operation one year ahead of schedule. In retrospect, during project preparation, the Bank&#13;
should always take into account the lengthy and complex rules of procurement existing in&#13;
Uruguay; to address it, procurement delays should be anticipated and timetables should be&#13;
realistic. These lessons learned have been followed during preparation of the proposed&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2. THE PROJECT ENTITY (UTE)&#13;
UTE's Organization and Management&#13;
2.1   UTE's day-to-day management is entrusted to a General Manager assisted by a&#13;
Deputy General Manager and three area managers, responsible respectively for: (i) power&#13;
generation and transmission; (ii) power distribution and commercialization; and (iii)&#13;
administration and finance. There is also an Economic Planning Secretariat which provides&#13;
staff functions to support the General Manager. These managers are very qualified and&#13;
competent and have substantial experience in the power subsector. The current&#13;
organizational structure of UTE is shown in Annex 7.&#13;
2.2   UTE is implementing an Institutional Development Program (IDP) aimed at&#13;
improving the overall efficiency of its operations and strengthening its distribution and&#13;
commercialization activities. As a first step, UTE has entered into a twinning contractual&#13;
agreement with a Spanish power utility (Uni6n Fenosa) to gain access to the commercial,&#13;
administrative and engineering technology of a more developed utility. A satisfactory new&#13;
organizational structure and new economic/financial information system have been&#13;
implemented. Under this IDP the management of UTE improved considerably during the&#13;
period 1990-94, particularly in its internal organization, by creating a Management&#13;
Information System which improved its accounting system, and in its relations with&#13;
consumers and in the commercial area (paras. 1.24, 2.5, 2.13 and 2.14). However, there is&#13;
yet room for improvement. Accordingly, during negotiations UTE agreed to implement a&#13;
Plan of Action to Improve UTE's Efficiency. The plan (see Annex 8 for additional details)&#13;
comprises three main areas of action: (i) creation of "Business Units"; (ii) privatization of&#13;
activities; and (iii) reduction of staff. This plan of action includes measures to desegregate&#13;
UTE into profit centers (creation of "Business Units"), allowing better management,&#13;
improved accountability, and possible privatization of some activities UTE performs&#13;
currently (such as pole manufacturing, transformer repair, and reforestation), which will&#13;
result in greater efficiency and reduction of staff. UTE would carry out the plan in&#13;
accordance with the timetable also included in Annex 8.&#13;
Staffing and Training&#13;
2.3   During the past three years UTE has reduced its permanent staffing by 13% (about&#13;
1500 employees), but it is still overstaffed. As of December 1994, UTE permanent staff&#13;
amounted to 9694 persons, of which 450 are professional (high level, with University&#13;
degrees). The labor productivity indicator, measured as the number of customers per&#13;
employee, was 104. Despite the improvement in labor productivity during the past decade&#13;
(from 74 in 1980 to 92 in 1992), it is still below the average for Latin American countries&#13;
(145). UTE's management is aware of the situation, and since 1989 UTE has frozen the&#13;
hiring of new staff. A retirement incentive program was carried out in 1990 and 1993.&#13;
UTE has completed a human resources data base and a study to match manpower and&#13;
management requirements for the next five years. This study is under implementation. In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
addition to the freeze on hiring, other actions are required to improve UTE's labor&#13;
productivity. During negotiations UTE agreed to improve its staff productivity as part of the&#13;
Plan of Action to Improve UTE's Efficiency, as described in para.2.2 and Annex 8.&#13;
2.4   UTE has a satisfactory and comprehensive training program and adequate facilities for&#13;
carrying it out. UTE's training center was rehabilitated under loan 3221-UR. In 1993,&#13;
about 4720 employees participated in 437 local courses and seminars, with an attendance of&#13;
about 5 hours per participant. To strengthen managerial and environmental capabilities, UTE&#13;
will carry out a five-year training program as described in Attachment 2 to Annex 11.&#13;
Management Information System&#13;
2.5   UTE has implemented a satisfactory Management Information System. It consists of&#13;
the following systems: (i) a complete computerized billing and collection system; (ii) a new&#13;
accounting and budget information system; (iii) an inventory system; (iv) a data base for&#13;
administration and control of human resources; (v) project accounts including financing and&#13;
disbursement information by credit; (vi) electronic mail; and (vii) a complete customer&#13;
information system. The Bank assisted in financing computer hardware and its later&#13;
upgrading. The mainframe purchased under Loan 3221-UR was burned in a fire, which&#13;
affected headquarters from floors 8 to 10, in August 1993. Currently, UTE is settling with&#13;
the insurance company on payment of the corresponding equipment and assets lost during the&#13;
fire. To make this Management Information System more effective, UTE has built up an&#13;
efficient communications network between headquarters and the regional offices, the first for&#13;
a public utility in Uruguay. UTE has voice, facsimile and computer links between&#13;
headquarters and its regional offices. A broad communications system through microwave is&#13;
under implementation for operational, commercial and financial activities.&#13;
Financial Management&#13;
2.6   Organization. The financial and accounting functions in UTE are under the&#13;
responsibility of the Area Manager for Resources, who is assisted by two sector managers.&#13;
The accounting process is centralized in headquarters. Regional operational and commercial&#13;
offices transmit all accounting transactions via modem to the computers located at&#13;
headquarters.&#13;
2.7   Accounting. UTE keeps its accounts in accordance with generally accepted&#13;
accounting principles. The accounts are generally consistent with those of international&#13;
accounting standards. UTE's current accounting system was established in April 1990 and&#13;
was developed in the context of a computerized system. The new system provides a&#13;
comprehensive and adequate presentation of UTE's accounts. UTE has a well-developed&#13;
computerized system for financial records, inventory, budget control, billing, fixed assets,&#13;
and payroll.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
2.8   Financing Planning. UTE's budgetary system complies with the national budget. In&#13;
July of each year the preparation of the subsequent year budget begins. The first task is an&#13;
update of the current year's budget. In addition to this annual budget, UTE also prepares a&#13;
corporate budget in September/October of each year, which includes the preparation of a&#13;
five-year investment plan and its corresponding financial projections. The practice of&#13;
modern public utilities requires that management be provided with a reliable long-term view&#13;
of the expected financial performance of the utility as a flexible financial management tool,&#13;
which would permit sensitivity analyses such as the composition of investment programs,&#13;
different operational scenarios, inflation, and foreign exchange fluctuations. To achieve this,&#13;
UT'E has adopted a long-term financial planning software model prepared jointly with the&#13;
Bank. UTE is using it satisfactorily.&#13;
2.9   External Audit. Since 1988, UTE's financial statements have been audited by the&#13;
Tribunal de Cuentas (TC), which is also responsible for the legal control of cash expenses&#13;
and purchases of all the State enterprises. For this reason the TC maintains a permanent&#13;
staff at UTE's headquarters. The TC is an autonomous body, which reports directly to&#13;
Congress. Audit regulations and standards are based on international auditing practices. The&#13;
quality of the audit reports have been acceptable and the reports include a management letter&#13;
listing the deficiencies found in the accounts. During 1989 to 1992, and due to the renewal&#13;
of UTE's accounting system, audits reports have been submitted to the Bank with a delay&#13;
over eight months. In 1993, UTE closed its accounting books with a delay of six months.&#13;
For 1994, UTE has taken measures to provide UTE's financial statements and Bank-financed&#13;
project accounts for auditing within the deadline agreed with the Bank. Audits of Bank-&#13;
financed projects have also been conducted by the TC. During negotiations assurances were&#13;
obtained from UTE that: (i) UTE's annual and Bank-financed project accounts will be&#13;
audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank; (ii) UTE would maintain separate&#13;
accounts for the project; and (iii) UTE would furnish to the Bank within five months after&#13;
the end of each fiscal year the audited project accounts, special account, statement of&#13;
expenditures, and UTE's financial statements.&#13;
2.10 Internal Audit. The internal audit function is the responsibility of the General&#13;
Manager. On paper, the internal auditing unit is in charge of periodically examining&#13;
operational, financial and accounting, security assessment of the computational software&#13;
system, and management control. In practice, this unit only covers the review of some&#13;
operational functions. During negotiations UTE agreed to strengthen its internal financial&#13;
control as detailed in the Plan of Action to Improve UTE's Efficiency, described in Annex 8.&#13;
2.11  Insurance. UTE follows sound insurance practices, generally consistent with those of&#13;
utilities elsewhere. Under Uruguayan law, UTE has to insure its assets at the state-owned&#13;
insurance bank (Banco de Seguros del Estado). UTE's hydroplants and main building are&#13;
insured against fire, explosion, and flooding (at about 83 % below their revalued cost). For&#13;
cost reasons, UTE has created an internal reserve provision for transmission towers, which&#13;
amounted to US$1.5 million at the end of 1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
2.12 Taxes. UTE is required to pay a 30% income tax. UTE must also pay custom duties&#13;
(ranging from 10% to 30%) and a 22% VAT (except for fuel oil purchased from ANCAP&#13;
and power energy purchased from CTM). A 10% tax is charged on electricity sales, of&#13;
which 5 % is reimbursed to the Treasury, and the remaining 5 % is kept by UTE. Since&#13;
1991, and in accordance with Law 16170, Art. 643, instead of paying dividends, UTE is&#13;
subject to Government appropriation of all cash surpluses. These cash surpluses are defined&#13;
as cash remaining after paying operating expenses, debt service, and capital expenditures not&#13;
financed by other sources, and maintaining adequate liquidity. The amount of cash surplus&#13;
transfer for the next fiscal year is defined at the time of approval of the National budget, as a&#13;
result of the discussions between UTE and OPP. Although not the best practice, this&#13;
procedure has shown adequate transparency on the amount of transfer being defined in&#13;
advance, and has not hindered UTE's administration. During project supervision, the Bank&#13;
would monitor the continuation of application of that policy (see para. 3.16).&#13;
Billing and Collection&#13;
2.13 Billing. UTE has a very well-developed billing system. These procedures have&#13;
improved considerably since 1992, as a result of the implementation of the IDP. UTE&#13;
conducts its billing activities through 57 distribution offices around the country. Consumers&#13;
are billed monthly. Data is electronically transmitted to headquarters (by modem). UTE&#13;
takes about 24 hours between metering and bill issuing. Bills are sent to customers about&#13;
four days after metering. Bills are due for payment two weeks after issuance.&#13;
2.14 Collection. UTE's collection procedures are also satisfactory. Bill collection from&#13;
private customers has improved from 60 days outstanding in 1989 to about 20 days in 1993,&#13;
as a result of the IDP. Bills from private customers are paid either directly in UTE's offices&#13;
around the country or in supermarkets, Banco Republica, ANTEL's and OSE's offices, or&#13;
lottery agencies. These agencies charge 0.85 % plus VAT on each bill, except for those bills&#13;
amounting to less than US$0.5, which is the bill processing cost. Consumers who do not&#13;
pay after five days from the due date are charged a fine of 5 % plus 0.2% per day of delay,&#13;
and after 21 days from the due date the customer's service is discontinued. After payment is&#13;
made, UTE takes about 24 hours to re-connect the supply. At the end of 1993, accounts&#13;
receivable from government agencies amounted to US$12.5 million, representing about 69&#13;
days of billing. This is due to a "clearing-house system" created by the Government in June&#13;
1990 (as agreed under Loan 3221-UR), by which public entities compensate owed balances&#13;
between the participants of the system with subsequent payment of any existing balance.&#13;
Arrears before June 1990 amounted to US$30 million, and are currently being reduced at a&#13;
rate of US$5 million per year. The covenant in Loan 3221-UR on collection of accounts&#13;
from public entity receivables would be maintained for this operation.&#13;

2.16   During the past five years, UTE has maintained a satisfactory financial performance,&#13;
although operating expenses are still high. These results have been possible because the&#13;
Government has permitted tariffs to increase in line with inflation, increases that are adequate&#13;
to cover marginal cost. Throughout this period, UTE has had a good debt service coverage,&#13;
an adequate self-financing ratio, and a satisfactory capital structure. Despite this financial&#13;
improvement, the cash operating margin and rate of return have been low due to an increase&#13;
in operating expenses. On the other hand, UTE has benefitted from sales to Argentina since&#13;
1990 (US$11.9 million in 1990, US$28 million in 1991, US$91.8 million in 1992, and&#13;
US$44.1 million in 1993). In 1993, UTE converted about US$380 million of arrears to&#13;
CTM (due to power energy purchased) into long-term debt. This debt was added to the debt&#13;
resulting from the construction of the Constitution hydroplant (El Palmar), which the&#13;
Government constructed and transferred to UlTE in 1983. In spite of these measures, UTE's&#13;
debt/equity ratio has remained at a reasonable level, around 40/60.&#13;

UTE's Projected Future Financial Performance&#13;
2.17 Projections of UTE's finances for the period 1995-2003 are presented in Annex 9,&#13;
and a summary for the loan disbursement period is presented below in Table 2.2. The&#13;

2.18   From  1995 onward, UTE's financial performance is expected to improve steadily as&#13;
sales continue to grow. Staff productivity would be increased through the action plan to be&#13;
agreed with the Bank (see Annex 8). UTE is expected to improve its cash operating margin&#13;
and generate a substantial amount of cash, after paying debt service and income taxes and&#13;
executing the investment program for the period 1995-2003 shown in Annex 6. While UTE&#13;
does not make dividend payments, UTE must transfer cash surpluses to the Treasury, as a&#13;
result of the application of Law 16170, Art. 643. To maintain a sound financial position, the&#13;
annual amount of this cash transfer would be decided at the time of the approval of UTE's&#13;
budget for the next year, i.e. by October of each year, and would take place only after&#13;
satisfactory self-financing, indebtedness and debt service ratios are met. The cash operating&#13;
margin is projected to improve from 38%  in 1995 to 46%  in 2003. Moreover, the self-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
financing ratio would be maintained at over 50%, and the debt service coverage ratio would&#13;
be 1.5 times during the loan's disbursement period.&#13;
2.19   Sensitivity analysis was carried out to verify the effect of: (a) export sales not&#13;
materializing; (b) a drought to occur in 1995 or any other year of the study period; and (c)&#13;
tariff increase at half of the inflation rate per year. Annex 9, Attachment 5 shows the results&#13;
of this sensitivity analysis for the next three and five years. The results for the next three&#13;
years (1995-1997) are summarized below:&#13;

Self-financing ratio           51            39            41            45&#13;
2.20 These indicators show that UTE's financial performance would remain sound even&#13;
under these very difficult operational conditions. Even in the event of external market (or&#13;
sales) failure to reach the expected values, UTE's internal cash generation would be&#13;
sufficient to fund over 40% of the investment program. It should be highlighted that the&#13;
Government should analyze UTE's budget carefully before transferring any cash surplus to&#13;
the Treasury.&#13;
2.21 To ensure a sound financial performance during project implementation, agreement&#13;
was obtained with UTE and the Government at negotiations', where applicable, that they&#13;
would take all necessary measures to ensure that:&#13;
(a)    UTE's ratio of total cash operating expenses to total operating revenues will&#13;
not be higher than: 60%  in 1995, 1996 and 1997; and 55%  in each year after&#13;
1997;&#13;
1.     Financial covenants included in Loan 3221-UR will be replaced accordingly.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
(b)   UTE's internal cash generation is sufficient to maintain a self-financing ratio of&#13;
no less than 50% from 1995 onwards;&#13;
(c)   UTE's debt service coverage ratio should not be lower than 1.5;&#13;
(d)   UTE will prepare a five-year financial projection, including the forecast cash&#13;
surplus' transfer agreed with OPP for the next year, which would be sent to&#13;
the Bank by October 31st of each year, for an exchange of views on the results&#13;
of such projections.&#13;
Investment Program&#13;
2.22 UTE's investment program follows least-cost criteria (Annex 6) and the market and&#13;
power balance criteria described in para. 1.31. UTE's transmission and distribution&#13;
investments have been maintained at around US$110 million (expressed in January 1994&#13;
prices). No further power generating investments would be carried out by UTE, except if&#13;
the private sector does not show interest in investing in the sector. This is consistent with&#13;
the Government's policy to allow private investors to construct and operate new generating&#13;
facilities. Annex 10 gives details of this program for the period 1995-2003. To ensure that&#13;
UJTE's future investments would adhere to the financing plan of the proposed project until&#13;
the project is completed, during negotiations UTE agreed not to undertake investments&#13;
(excluding those for the project) exceeding in any year 1 % of the established value of the&#13;
company's fully revalued fixed assets in operation, without prior consultation with the Bank.&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
Project Origin&#13;
3.1   The obsolescence of the underground distribution system of Montevideo was discussed&#13;
between UTE and the Bank during the preparation of Loan 2484-UR (Power Engineering&#13;
Loan), and consequently consultants studies funded by that loan analyzed the issue. In fact&#13;
the power distribution system of Montevideo is very old (some parts are more than sixty&#13;
years old) and requires modernization to reduce service interruptions and technical losses that&#13;
hurt Uruguayan industry and service operations. The actual network topology is totally&#13;
inadequate without circuit breakers in the 30-kV system, resulting in several substations&#13;
going out of service when a fault occurs in one of them. The distribution voltage to the&#13;
consumers is phase-to-phase, which can result in very dangerous situations since no neutral&#13;
(ground) connection is offered. This scheme also increases technical losses due to lack of&#13;
grounding. The studies performed under Loan 2484-UR recommended the complete&#13;
renovation of the distribution system by changing the voltage levels from 220 Volts (phase-&#13;
to-phase) to grounded 380/220 Volts and from 6 kV and 30 kV to a sole medium voltage of&#13;
22 kV. Due to its concern over the amount of the proposed investment, UTE undertook&#13;
another similar study using different consultants (funded by a bilateral agreement with&#13;
Sweden), which confirmed the recommendations of the previous study. UTE and the&#13;
Government then asked the Bank to assist with project implementation. The project was&#13;
identified by a Bank mission in December 1992, and was prepared by UTE's planning&#13;
division based on the above mentioned studies and additional consultant studies requested by&#13;
the Bank. It was appraised in May 1994.&#13;
Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
3.2   Uruguay's power sector is going through a critical period of reforms, including the&#13;
establishment of a new regulatory system, modernization of institutions and the promotion of&#13;
private participation. The proposed project would allow the Bank to be instrumental in&#13;
furthering these reforms and in providing the necessary assistance to implement them,&#13;
profiting from the Bank world-wide experience in sector reforms. In addition, it would&#13;
address the increasing obsolescence of Uruguay's capital stock and help overcome one of the&#13;
greatest concerns raised by the productive sector in a recent Bank survey: power supply&#13;
reliability. The proposed project is in line with the Bank's objective of enhancing Uruguayan&#13;
productivity to improve economic competitiveness. The strategy envisaged combines: (a)&#13;
maintaining Bank dialogue with the Government to help in the implementation of the new&#13;
regulatory framework; and (b) helping the Government to increase the reliability of power&#13;
distribution.&#13;

Project Objectives&#13;
3.3   The proposed project aims to improve the reliability of the electricity service at least&#13;
cost and to promote the sustainability of the reforms recently implemented in the power&#13;
sector by helping UTE to adapt to the new institutional framework. Project objectives&#13;
include: (i) consolidating sector reforms; (ii) consolidating UTE's institutional&#13;
improvements; (iii) improving power distribution reliability; (iv) promoting more efficient&#13;
use of energy; and (v) improving customer safety.&#13;
Project Description&#13;
3.4   This project would be the first part of a staged approach to modernize the Montevideo&#13;
distribution network. The renovation of the Montevideo distribution network recommended&#13;
by the consultant studies (see para. 3.1) would entail very large investments and needs to be&#13;
implemented in several phases. The proposed project would cover the first phase, which&#13;
would renovate the areas of the city under the influence of substations G, L, and R. This&#13;
would include the most critical areas in the city, and would be followed by additional areas&#13;
to be renovated under a possible IDB project under preparation. The proposed project would&#13;
also include the strengthening, adaptation and expansion of the transmission system to&#13;
ensure the renovation of the distribution system as well as power supply for market growth.&#13;
Annex 11 gives details of the project description including terms of reference for the&#13;
Technical Assistance component and details of the training component. The proposed project&#13;
would include:&#13;
(a)   modification of 500-kV substations -- consisting of the expansion of substations&#13;
I in Montevideo and San Carlos in Punta del Este through the installation of&#13;
two power transformers (250 MVA 500/150 kV each), reactive power control&#13;
devices and the related switchgear equipment in each of these substations, and&#13;
the installation of new 500-kV line bays in substations A and B;&#13;
(b)   expansion of the 150-kV transmission system in Montevideo -- consisting of&#13;
the replacement of the switchgear equipment (breakers and switches) and&#13;
reinforcement of grounding system of the 150-kV substations to make them&#13;
appropriate for the new short circuit requirements of the system, the expansion&#13;
of substations E and J, the installation of a new substation G, and the&#13;
installation of about 26 km of 150-kV underground cable interconnecting&#13;
substations;&#13;
(c)   first phase of the renovation of the Montevideo distribution system including&#13;
voltage change of the medium voltage (22-kV) system and of the low voltage&#13;
(380/220 Volts) system -- consisting of installation of a completely new system&#13;
in the areas of influence of substations G, L and R;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
(d)  technical assistance -- consisting of consultant services to help UTE to&#13;
restructure in business units as part of the sector reforms, to implement the&#13;
Non-Technical Losses Reduction Program, to help UTE to develop load&#13;
characteristics studies for marginal cost analysis and for load management&#13;
actions, to help UTE to update its marginal cost studies, to prepare and&#13;
implement a Demand-side Management Program and to assist with project&#13;
implementation; and&#13;
(e)  training -- the training program would consist of: (i) a managerial seminar to&#13;
train UTE's managers for the new power sector structure; (ii) seminars for&#13;
UTE's staff on the new sector structure and UTE's changing role; and (iii)&#13;
environmental aspects to strengthen UTE's environmental unit.&#13;
Project Implementation&#13;
3.5   The project implementation plan was agreed during appraisal taking into consideration&#13;
lessons learned on past projects with UTE, and aimed especially at: (i) having a strong&#13;
implementation unit; and (ii) having a satisfactory procurement plan including the advance&#13;
preparation of procurement documents. The project would be coordinated within UTE by a&#13;
project coordinator, with the help of a full-time project unit. The Project Coordinator and&#13;
Directors for each project component (Transmission, Distribution, and Training) with&#13;
qualifications satisfactory to the Bank would be appointed as a condition of effectiveness of&#13;
this loan. The project coordinator and the project directors would work within the&#13;
framework of UTE's organization with the assistance of the project unit, and of the&#13;
procurement, construction, engineering, and finance units (the same implementation unit for&#13;
the on-going projects). UTE would keep the project unit in place during implementation.&#13;
The project coordinator and the project directors would be qualified professionals who would&#13;
not be replaced without consultation with the Bank. Bank standard bidding documents for&#13;
international competitive bidding (ICB) will be used. UTE would implement the project in&#13;
accordance with an agreed Project Implementation Plan described in Annex 12, which&#13;
includes the agreed procurement plan and the corresponding timetable. Confirmation of&#13;
these agreements was obtained during negotiations.&#13;
Status of Project Preparation&#13;
3.6   Project preparation is completed. The feasibility study for the modifications in the&#13;
distribution system has been completed, and the consultants have issued the final report. The&#13;
economic feasibility study has been prepared and found to be satisfactory by the Bank. The&#13;
transmission study (funded by Loan 3221-UR) has also been completed. The consulting firm&#13;
to carry out the energy options study was selected during preparation of this project and&#13;
services are expected to be concluded in November 1995. The environmental studies have&#13;
been completed. During negotiations, agreement was reached on a procurement plan and the&#13;
corresponding timetable. This was included in the Project Implementation Plan (see para.&#13;
3.5).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
Project Costs&#13;
3.7   The total project cost, excluding interest during constniction, is estimated at&#13;
US$196.5 million , of which US$125.0 million would be foreign cost. Costs are expressed&#13;
in June 1994 prices and are based on experience with similar projects in the country and&#13;
abroad. Physical contingencies are 5 % of base cost for the transmission component and 10%&#13;
of base cost for the distribution and technical assistance components. Price contingencies&#13;
assume: (i) a project execution period of six years; and (ii) price escalation on base costs&#13;
and physical contingencies of 2.0% in 1995, 2.5% in 1996, 2.7% in 1997, 2.5% in 1998,&#13;
2.6% in 1999, and 2.7% in 2000-01. It is assumed that variations in the exchange rate&#13;
would compensate for the difference between local and international inflation rates.&#13;
3.8   The cost estimate for the project is summarized in the following table:&#13;

Project Financing&#13;
3.9    The total financing requirements (including interest during construction of US$31.5&#13;
million equivalent), are estimated at US$228 million equivalent. The Bank would finance the&#13;
foreign component of goods, the technicai assistance and the training program. UTE would&#13;
finance the local costs and interest during construction. So that UTE can continue the&#13;
ongoing study of load characteristics and initiate other studies, particularly the Non-Technical&#13;
Losses Reduction Program, as well as initiate the most urgent procurement of goods, US$3.0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
million would be provided for retroactive financing of expenditures made before loan signing&#13;
and after June 30, 1995. The financing plan of the proposed project would be as follows:&#13;

3.11   Procurement of goods to be financed from the proceeds of the proposed loan would&#13;
be done through international competitive bidding (ICB) following Bank Guidelines for&#13;
Procurement. In the eventuality of contracts costing between US$50,000 and US$250,000,&#13;
they would be procured by local competitive bidding (LCB) acceptable to the Bank. Smaller&#13;
contract packages costing less than US$50,000 would be procured under international&#13;
shopping up to an aggregate amount of US$1 million. Bids from domestic manufacturers&#13;
for goods may receive a margin of preference of 15 % or the applicable import duties,&#13;
whichever is lower, for bid evaluation. Contracts funded with local funds would be procured&#13;
under local competitive bidding (LCB) following UTE's procurement procedures.&#13;
Consultants would be selected from a short list of consulting firms in accordance with Bank&#13;
Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. The terms of reference for hiring Consultants were&#13;
discussed during appraisal and are summarized in Annex 11. UTE has a long tradition of&#13;
implementing projects under Bank financing, which has allowed it to develop good capacity&#13;
for procurement actions and thorough familiarization with Bank guidelines. Moreover,&#13;
UTE's local procurement procedures are compatible with Bank guidelines. To expedite&#13;
procurement, UTE has divided the procurement into 21 bid packages (15 funded under the&#13;
proposed loan and 6 funded by UTE) as detailed in the procurement plan agreed during&#13;
appraisal and as described in Annex 12. During negotiations agreement was reached to use&#13;
the Bank-issued Standard Bidding Documents for all ICB procurement financed from the&#13;
proceeds of the proposed loan. It was also agreed that in case of conflict between local&#13;
legislation and the Bank's procurement policy, the latter would prevail if appropriate&#13;
provisions are included in the Loan Agreement. Such special provisions were included in the&#13;
procurement schedule to the Loan Agreement.&#13;
3.12   During project supervision, all document relevant to Bank-financed goods contracts&#13;
above a threshold of US$250,000 would be subject to the Bank's prior review procedures.&#13;
The prior review process would cover all goods contracts procured by ICB. This would&#13;
represent almost 100% of Bank financed contracts for goods. Selective post review of&#13;
awarded contracts below the threshold levels would be carried out on about 1 in 10 goods&#13;
contracts. Consultant contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of US$100,000 or more for&#13;
consulting firms and US$50,000 or more for individuals, and the corresponding terms of&#13;
reference would also be subject to the Bank's prior review.&#13;
Disbursements&#13;
3.13   The proceeds of the proposed loan are expected to be disbursed over six years (see&#13;
Annex 12, Attachment 4). The disbursement schedule reflects the Bank's standard sector&#13;
profile and experience with past power projects in Uruguay. The proposed loan would be&#13;
disbursed against:&#13;
(a)   100 % of the foreign currency expenditures and 100% of local expenditures&#13;
(ex-factory cost) for goods for the expansion of the transmission system (500&#13;
kV and 150 kV) and for the renovation of the distribution system of&#13;
Montevideo;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
(b)   100% of expenditures for technical assistance; and&#13;
(c)   100% of expenditures for the training program.&#13;
3.14   To expedite disbursements, a special account would be established in the Central&#13;
Bank of Uruguay with a maximum deposit of approximately US$2 million, estimated to&#13;
cover four months of average expenditures to be financed from the Special Account. The&#13;
account would be replenished by the Bank in accordance with agreed procedures.&#13;
Disbursements against contracts or purchase orders of US$250,000 equivalent or less for&#13;
goods and less than US$100,000 equivalent for consultant firms and less than US$50,000 for&#13;
individual consultants, would be made against statement of expenditures (SOEs) prepared and&#13;
certified by UTE. Non-contract expenditures (such as training) would also be made against&#13;
SOEs. Documentation for these expenditures would not be submitted to the Bank, but would&#13;
be retained by UTE for periodic inspection by Bank staff and for audit purposes. All other&#13;
disbursements would be made against full documentation. The closing date would be&#13;
December 31, 2002, six months after the estimated completion of the project.&#13;
Project Operation&#13;
3.15   No special arrangements are required to operate this project beyond existing UTE&#13;
present practices, as it will be part of UTE's existing procedures which have been&#13;
functioning satisfactorily (see para. 3.5).&#13;
Monitoring and Reporting&#13;
3.16   The Bank would be furnished with quarterly project progress reports. The scope and&#13;
content of the report were agreed during negotiations, and would follow the existing model&#13;
used in ongoing projects. The timely implementation of the project depends on adequate&#13;
financial resources being made available when needed. For this reason, formal meetings&#13;
would take place every year, within four months of the conclusion of the fiscal year, to&#13;
review project progress and financing. The meeting, to be held not later than April 30,&#13;
1998, will be the Mid-term Review of the project. To improve the efficiency of those&#13;
meetings, UTE would present to the Bank one month in advance to the meeting date, a&#13;
report indicating the achievements made in project implementation and a proposal regarding&#13;
estimated future project disbursements and the corresponding financing plan for the&#13;
remaining project implementation period. In view of the experience with UTE in ongoing&#13;
and past projects, regular Bank supervision would be required. Bank supervision input into&#13;
key activities is presented in Annex 16. A framework for project monitoring and reporting is&#13;
presented in Annex 13.&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
3.17   UTE's expansion plan was prepared based on an average annual expected load&#13;
growth of 4.26% for the next ten years, which is considered appropriate. The generation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
expansion plan was based on a power balance study prepared by UTE, which the Bank found&#13;
satisfactory, and on a feasibility study prepared by Southern Electric International (Feasibility&#13;
Study of Units 3 and 4 Batlle y Ordoiiez Power Station and Expansion of La Tablada Power&#13;
Station) under a grant from the US Government. The transmission system expansion plan&#13;
was based on a consultant study prepared by UTE with the help of MARTE Engenharia&#13;
(Obras de Trasmisi6n, Comunicaciones y Telecontrol - Periodo 1994/2000 - Expansion Plan&#13;
for Transmission, Telecommunications and Telecontrol Systems for Period 1994-2000),&#13;
financed under Loan 3221-UR, and later updated by UTE. The renovation of the distribution&#13;
system was recommended by a consultant study prepared by Fitchner (Estudio de&#13;
Distribuci6n de Energfa) financed under Loan 2484-UR, and confirmed by an additional&#13;
study prepared by SwedPower (Consulting Services for Feasibility Studies of New Topology&#13;
of the Distribution System for UTE Montevideo) under a grant from the Swedish&#13;
Government. The above studies demonstrate that UTE's expansion plan represents the least-&#13;
cost solution for the required system expansion. The Bank has reviewed those studies and&#13;
found them to be satisfactory.&#13;
3.18   The proposed project includes investments in two different areas: (i) transmission&#13;
expansion to allow adequate supply of electricity to an expanding market; and (ii) renovation&#13;
of the distribution system in three areas in the city of Montevideo to improve reliability,&#13;
reduce technical losses, and extend the life of the power system. It is difficult to separate&#13;
accurately the benefits from each of these investments from the general benefits resulting&#13;
from the investment program. However, to avoid any uncertainty, a careful approach was&#13;
utilized in the economic analysis of the project, as detailed in Annex 14. Under this&#13;
approach two different rates of return were calculated: first, the internal economic rate of&#13;
return of the renovation of the distribution system of Montevideo; and second, the internal&#13;
economic rate of return of the entire investment program for the period 1995-2003.&#13;
3.19   The internal economic rate of return of UTE's investment program for period 1995-&#13;
2003 is 15.4%. Details of the calculation appear in Annex 14. It was computed at a&#13;
discount rate equalizing the present value of the stream of costs and benefits associated with&#13;
UTE's expansion plan. The cost stream, in constant 1994 prices, includes the capital cost of&#13;
the investment program and the associated incremental operating and maintenance costs.&#13;
Revenues derived from incremental sales were used as a proxy for benefits. The benefits&#13;
stream represents revenues generated by the investment program using average tariffs, also in&#13;
constant prices, assuming that these benefits are attributed to the program at levels of 50% in&#13;
1995, 60% in 1996, 70% in 1997, 80% in 1998 and 100% from 1999 on. This rate of&#13;
return calculation is conservative because other benefits to the society and the economy of&#13;
the country -- such as those derived from improvement of service quality to customers and&#13;
availability of energy -- were not included in this analysis.&#13;
3.20   The internal economic rate of return of the renovation of the distribution system is&#13;
25.1 %. The proposed project would finance only the first phase of UTE's renovation&#13;
program; however, no attempt was made to evaluate the internal economic rate of return of&#13;
this separate part of the system because the renovation in question will, in fact, install a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
completely new system with different voltage levels. Therefore, the only justification to&#13;
implement the first phase is as part of the renovation of the whole system. The details of the&#13;
calculation appear in Annex 14. The cost stream includes the capital cost of the renovation&#13;
equipment and works for the entire distribution system in Montevideo, the operating and&#13;
maintenance costs and the upstream costs (generation and transmission) of energy supplied&#13;
for the condition with and without the renovation. The benefits were measured by consumer&#13;
willingness to pay for the unsupplied energy in the "without project" scenario, conservatively&#13;
estimated at its bound value as the cost of unsupplied energy at current tariffs. The amount&#13;
of unsupplied energy per year was calculated as the amount of energy the actual distribution&#13;
system would be unable to supply due to lack of additional capacity. This is a conservative&#13;
estimate since the unsupplied energy due to service interruptions (low reliability) was not&#13;
included.&#13;
3.21   Sensitivity analyses were carried out to evaluate the impact on the base case internal&#13;
economic rate of return as a result of variations in key parameters. The results of these&#13;
analyses were:&#13;

Environmental Aspects&#13;
3.22   This project has been rated "B" by the Bank for environmental assessment (EA)&#13;
purposes. No adverse environmental impacts are expected to result from the project, since&#13;
the majority of works will be for renovation and substitution of existing facilities. The&#13;
expansion of the 500-kV system will comprise the installation of transformers in already&#13;
existing sub-stations. A satisfactory environmental analysis of UTE's transmission program&#13;
has been completed. A report dated May 1994 entitled "UTE - Proyecto de Expansi6n del&#13;
Sistema de Transmisi6n 1994-200 - Estudio de Impacto Ambiental" was published and made&#13;
available to the public in Uruguay and in the Bank's Public Information Center in&#13;
Washington, D.C. The modification of the 150-kV system will consist of changing&#13;
equipment in already existing installations and the addition of underground cables and one&#13;
compact substation, so there should consequently be no adverse environmental effects. The&#13;
modemization of the distribution network will consist of replacing old cables by new ones at&#13;
the same site.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3.23   The Bank would help UTE through this project to strengthen its environmental unit.&#13;
Based on the results of an assessment study carried out by consultants (funded by Loan 3221-&#13;
UR), a restructuring of the Environmental Unit was agreed during appraisal, as well as a&#13;
training program on environmental topics. Such restructuring covers the objectives,&#13;
functions and organization of the Environmental Unit, as well as procedures for incorporating&#13;
environmental concerns in the sector. UTE began implementing such a new structure in&#13;
January 1995 as agreed with the Bank. Agreement to include a specific environmental&#13;
component in UTE's training program was achieved during negotiations.&#13;
Financial Benefits&#13;
3.24   The borrower has considered the Bank's alternative loan terrn options -- currency&#13;
pool loan, LIBOR-based single currency loan and fixed rate single currency loan terms -- and&#13;
has selected LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loan terms, in order to improve the&#13;
management of its external liabilities. The choice of US dollar termns was motivated by a&#13;
better match between cash inflows and outflows in that currency, which is the base of&#13;
country external commerce. The LIBOR-based single currency loan was considered&#13;
preferable because of the long grace period and final maturity offers. The borrower&#13;
estimated that the risk posed by the volatility of LEBOR-based single currency loan rating&#13;
rate would be mitigated in the medium range; short period higher rates would be&#13;
compensated by subsequent periods of lower ratio, averaging a rate in the same order of the&#13;
fixed rate. However, the much better grace period and maturity would match better the life&#13;
span of the proposed investments.&#13;
Project Benefits&#13;
3.25   By upgrading the antiquated power distribution system in the Montevideo area, the&#13;
project would improve power supply reliability to industrial customers and hence help&#13;
improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the productive sectors. Institutional reforms&#13;
supported by the project would promote private sector participation in power generation,&#13;
which together with more effective demand-side management (also supported by the project)&#13;
would result in efficiency gains and improve the quality of the electricity service to the&#13;
majority of the population. The economic rate of return is expected to be 15.4 percent.&#13;
Risks&#13;
3.26   The project has no special technical risks. The Presidential Decree creating the&#13;
Energy Technical Commission was enacted as a condition of negotiations. The new&#13;
regulatory system being designed would create a competitive market for power generation&#13;
and its implementation is a condition (spelled out in an agreement with Argentina) for&#13;
uruguayan generators to have access to the Argentine competitive power market. However,&#13;
since the creation of this new regulatory system is a condition of effectiveness, there is the&#13;
risk of delay in beginning project implementation if the Government delays issuing those&#13;
regulations. Risks of delays during project implementation have been minimized by adopting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
a more realistic time schedule for implementation in line with past projects experience, and&#13;
by having already drafted bidding documents for procurement of the most important items&#13;
(representing 50% of total project cost) and terms of reference for hiring consultants.&#13;
Additionally, UTE will hire consultants to assist with project implementation, reducing the&#13;
risks of delays even further.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

URUGUAY&#13;
Power Transmission and Distribution Project&#13;
Energy Demand&#13;
The energy demand in Uruguay in 1992 was 2052 kTOE (thousand equivalent tons of&#13;
oil), resulting in a per capita consumption of 0.649 TOE, which compares adequately with&#13;
other countries at the same level of development of Uruguay. The growth of energy demand&#13;
has followed economic growth very closely. During 1980-85 when the economy (GDP) went&#13;
into recession (annual decrease of 3.7%) energy demand declined by 3.5% per year, and&#13;
during the period 1985-91, when GDP growth was 3.4%, energy demand grew by 2.29%&#13;
annually.&#13;
Energy demand is concentrated in the residential (37%), industrial (29%) and&#13;
transport (27%) sectors. Petroleum products dominate energy demand (54.5%), with diesel&#13;
oil representing 45.5% of the oil derivative consumption. Electricity represents 17.7% of&#13;
total consumption. The following tables present energy consumption by sector.&#13;

ANNEX 2&#13;
URUGUAY&#13;
Power Transmission and Distribution Project&#13;
Power Sector Reform&#13;
1.    Background. The energy sector in Uruguay is currently monopolistic. The Ministry&#13;
of Industry, Energy, and Mines (MIE) is responsible for sector planning, policy setting, and&#13;
for supervising the two state controlled companies in the sector: the National Power&#13;
Company (Administraci6n Nacional de Usinas y Trasmisiones - UTE) and the National&#13;
Petroleum Company (Administraci6n Nacional de Combustibles, Alcohol y Portland -&#13;
ANCAP). Both companies operate national monopolies in each area, with a mix of activities&#13;
in operation and regulation. There is no regulatory entity in the sector, and UTE and&#13;
ANCAP fix the quality standards for supply of energy products and propose tariffs to the&#13;
Government, although the Government is reforming the sector and a new Institutional&#13;
Framework should be in place as a condition of effectiveness of this loan.&#13;
2.    Power Sector Institutional Structure. UTE is the sole generation, transmission and&#13;
distribution company in the country, with the exception of the binational entity CTM, which&#13;
operates a 1890 MW hydroplant. UTE is an autonomous public entity governed by a Board&#13;
of Directors appointed by the Government. UTE reports to the MIE, but its budget is&#13;
approved by the Planning and Budget Office (OPP). The Government Auditing Agency&#13;
(Tribunal de Cuentas) reviews budget allocation and procurement process, and also audits&#13;
UTE's financial statements. UTE prepares the tariff increase studies and submits them to&#13;
OPP, which drafts a Presidential Decree approving it.&#13;
3.    Power Sector Reform Studies. The Government is reforming the power sector&#13;
aiming at: (i) making the regulatory function independent of UTE; and (ii) promoting&#13;
private investment in power generation. Under Loan 3517-0-UR, consultant studies were&#13;
carried out and a final report was issued in October 1993 with an assessment of the existing&#13;
institutional framework, proposal for a new institutional model, and draft of a Presidential&#13;
Decree creating the new institutional system.&#13;
4.    Proposed New Power Sector Institutional Framework. The proposed institutional&#13;
framework has the following main characteristics:&#13;
(a)  Separation of Roles of the State: The state will be responsible for defining&#13;
sector policies and for regulating the sector. All regulatory activities presently under&#13;
UTE responsibility would be transferred to the Government. Additionally, UTE will&#13;
be kept as a public utility, but competing with private investors in power generation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
(b) Role of the Private Sector: Private investors will be allowed to install new&#13;
power generating units to compete with UTE in an open competitive market. Private&#13;
investment in transmission and distribution in some areas of the country will also be&#13;
allowed.&#13;
(c)   Energy Technical Commission: An Energy Technical Commission was created&#13;
by decree on November 7, 1994. It will be composed of representatives of the&#13;
Minister of Industry, Energy and Mines, the Minister of Economy and Finances, and&#13;
the Director of the Planning and Budget Office. This new entity would be assisted&#13;
by technical units to help the Government on regulatory issues in the sector and on&#13;
setting tariffs.&#13;
(d)  Regulatory Body: The regulatory body would be the Ministry of Industry,&#13;
Energy, and Mines, through the Direcci6n Nacional de Energfa. It would supervise&#13;
the long-term free market between generators and distributors, regulate the short&#13;
term market, and regulate the distribution of electricity including approving tariffs.&#13;
(e)   Sector Structure: The sector will be divided into three areas - generation,&#13;
transmission and distribution. UTE would continue to be a government-owned&#13;
power utility, but its transmission and distribution activities would be separated into&#13;
business units. Although UTE would not be privatized, the new framework would&#13;
allow it to be in the future if the Government decides so. UTE will be subject to the&#13;
same regulatory rules as private sector participants.&#13;
(f)   Generation: Competition will be introduce~d into the generation of electricity.&#13;
Independent power producers will construct and operate new power generation plants&#13;
and would sell energy to UTE-generation and/or UTE-distribution, large consumers&#13;
or private distributors. Two markets will exist: (i) a long-term market where&#13;
distributors and large consumers would freely negotiate power contracts with&#13;
generators; and (ii) a regulated short-term market in which electricity will be&#13;
negotiated in an hourly or daily basis at regulated prices defined by the short-run&#13;
marginal cost of the system. Large consumers will also be free to negotiate long&#13;
term contracts with generators of their choice.&#13;
(g) Transmission: UTE-transmission will own the interconnection system. It will&#13;
charge a transmission tariff based on economic cost per kWh transmitted in the&#13;
system at cost levels defined by the regulatory body. It will allow open access to the&#13;
system by all users. New investments in the transmission system will be made by&#13;
UTE or by private transmitters.&#13;
(h)  National Dispatch Center (NDC): The dispatch of generating units and&#13;
transmission facilities, as well as of international interconnections, will be&#13;
coordinated by this entity. The NDC will define the economic dispatch of power&#13;
generation aiming at minimizing production cost and losses. The long-term market&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
will predominate and therefore, long-term prices are expected to be negotiated at&#13;
levels not lower than production cost.&#13;
(i)   Distribution: UTE-distribution will operate the existing distribution system,&#13;
and will be responsible for supplying energy in its concession area. New distribution&#13;
companies will be allowed to participate in regional areas which are not served by&#13;
IUTE. Any large consumer will be free to buy energy from any producer, paying for&#13;
the use of the distribution system owned by third parties.&#13;
5.   Timetable of Implementation: Attachment 1 to this Annex shows the timetable&#13;
agreed during negotiations.&#13;

ANNEX 3&#13;
URUGUAY&#13;
Power Transmission and Distribution Project&#13;
Energy Options Study&#13;
1.    Background. Uruguay has very limited indigenous energy resources. MERCOSUR,&#13;
however, brings the possibility of Uruguay importing energy from its neighboring countries&#13;
as well as the possibility of exporting eventual surpluses during periods of excess productive&#13;
capacity. These new possibilities would allow Uruguay to optimize its energy options in a&#13;
new approach, different from past trends. During the preparation of the proposed project&#13;
the Government contracted a consultant study to recommend the most cost-effective energy&#13;
strategy Uruguay should pursue.&#13;
2.    Objective of the Study. The study will analyze the options Uruguay should consider&#13;
for supplying its energy needs for the next ten years, and recommend a strategy to achieve&#13;
maximum economy and reliability of energy supply, detailing the best mix of energy sources&#13;
to that end.&#13;
3.    Terms of Reference. The study was contracted with the following Terms of&#13;
Reference agreed between the Bank and MIE:&#13;
(i)  Scope of the Study. The study would include (at a minimum):&#13;
(a)    Analysis of Past Supply and Demand - Analyze data of past supply and&#13;
demand for each sub-sector (electricity, oil derivatives, gas, coal,&#13;
wood) of the energy sector. Such analysis should include an&#13;
assessment of the adequacy of supply, eventual shortages and their&#13;
reasons, origin of the primary energy and final use of the energy.&#13;
(b)    Future Demand Projections - Estimate future demand for each sub-&#13;
sector of the energy sector for the next 10 years. The eventual energy&#13;
exchange (particularly natural gas and electricity) with Argentina and&#13;
Brazil should be considered.&#13;
(c)   Interconnection with Argentina - A technical and economic analysis of&#13;
the eventual interconnection with Argentina. In this respect the&#13;
following should be analyzed in detail: (i) the potential gas market in&#13;
Uruguay; (ii) the possibility of real commitment from the gas suppliers&#13;
in Argentina for exporting natural gas to Uruguay in the necessary&#13;
volume; (iii) estimates of electricity sales possible to export to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
Argentina and the resulting need for gas for generation; (iv)&#13;
preliminary design of the gas pipeline and its estimated investment&#13;
costs; (v) estimates of the price of natural gas delivered in&#13;
Montevideo; (vi) based on the study UTE is preparing on the&#13;
modifications in its thermoplants to use gas, calculate the price of&#13;
electricity generated; (vii) a global technical and economic analysis of&#13;
the interconnection through the natural gas pipeline bringing gas from&#13;
Argentina and selling electricity to the Argentinean market.&#13;
(d)   Interconnection with Brazil - A technical and economic analysis of the&#13;
eventual interconnection with Brazil through a transmission system to&#13;
bring electricity to Uruguay. The exchange of power in both&#13;
directions profiting from the interconnection should be assessed and&#13;
quantified.&#13;
(e)    Recommendations - Based on the above studies and taking into&#13;
consideration the existing ANCAP capacity for refining petroleum (as&#13;
well as the reflects that a new mix would bring to the energy supply)&#13;
and the firewood production of the country, formulate&#13;
recommendations of options Uruguay should pursue to secure an&#13;
economic and reliable supply of energy, with the possibility of&#13;
benefiting from exchange with its neighbors.&#13;
(ii) Consultant Hired. The government recommended and the Bank had no&#13;
objection to the Government hiring the Argonne National Laboratory (Illinois,&#13;
U.S.A.) to carry out the study. The consultant proposed a satisfactory work&#13;
program consisting of eight specialist-months of work and two missions to&#13;
Uruguay. The study is being carried out and expected to be concluded by&#13;
November 1995.&#13;
(iii) Counte=art. The Government of Uruguay is represented by the Planning and&#13;
Budget Office (OPP), which is managing the contract. UTE is giving technical&#13;
support to the study.&#13;

ANNEX 4&#13;
URUGUAY&#13;
Power Transmission and Distribution Project&#13;
Energy Pricing&#13;
1.    Background. The pricing of different forms of energy is a determining factor in&#13;
consumers' choice of the most adequate form of energy to consume. Price distortions and&#13;
subsidies can result in inducing consumers to inadequate use. During project preparation the&#13;
Bank contracted an individual consultant to assess the price levels of electricity and of oil&#13;
derivative products, including an assessment of the eventual existence of subsidies and of the&#13;
taxation existing on energy.&#13;
2.     Terms of Reference. The study was carried out in accordance with the following&#13;
TOR:&#13;
(i) Objective: These TOR detail the tasks performed by an individual consultant&#13;
hired by the Bank to assist with the preparation of UTE's Transmission and&#13;
Distribution Project. The consultant conducted a research on the existence of&#13;
subsidies in energy prices and on the existing tax on energy prices.&#13;
(ii) Tasks: The consultant:&#13;
(a)    visited Uruguay to collect all data relative to power tariff (inclusive&#13;
Long Range Marginal Costs studies prepared in the past), oil&#13;
derivative prices, gas; taxation on electricity, oil derivatives and gas;&#13;
and possible subsidies existing in the pricing system of these products.&#13;
(b)    analyzed the data collected and prepared a report giving: (i) an opinion&#13;
on the LRMC studies already performed and the updated value of the&#13;
LRMC calculated by UTE; (ii) an opinion on the level and structure of&#13;
power tariffs; (iii) an opinion on the level and structure of the prices of&#13;
oil derivatives and gas, taking into account international prices where&#13;
feasible; (iv) an opinion on the tax system on energy; and (v)&#13;
identification of eventual subsidies in energy price structures and&#13;
among different forms of energy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
(c)    helped the Bank team in the analysis of the economic rate of return of&#13;
the project, particularly for the rehabilitation and modernization of the&#13;
distribution network of Montevideo.&#13;
(d)    visited Uruguay for one week to help the Bank team during the pre-&#13;
appraisal mission of the Project.&#13;
(e)    submitted a final report.&#13;
3.     Results. The consultant study arrived at the following conclusions and&#13;
recommendations:&#13;
(a)   Uruguay's energy sector reveals an institutional organization dominated by&#13;
powerful state monopolies which generate a substantial portion of state&#13;
revenues both through the appropriation of operating surpluses and through&#13;
taxes on oil products which are transferred to the Government.&#13;
(b)   UTE, the electricity monopoly, undertook a concerted effort to rationalize the&#13;
price structure according to marginal cost guidelines in the last decade&#13;
following recommendations from a tariff study carried out in 1982 (under Bank&#13;
financing). UTE has trained competent staff to deal with tariff questions and&#13;
is qualified to update marginal cost analyses if required.&#13;
(c)   Pricing levels for electricity are currently on the same order as marginal costs.&#13;
Final prices to consumers (including an excise tax of 10% to all consumers -&#13;
IMESI) are in excess of marginal costs for most categories. Pricing for&#13;
different categories depends on marginal cost analyses and no distinction is&#13;
made among consumers posing the same cost burden to the system. The only&#13;
remnants of subsidization are a first energy block in the residential and general&#13;
tariffs for low consumption users, which are cross-subsidized by larger&#13;
residential users who pay a tariff in excess of cost. Otherwise, tariffs are&#13;
correctly structured according to costs.&#13;
(d)   For future electricity tariff improvements it is recommended that a seasonality&#13;
element be incorporated, which would reflect the higher costs of energy during&#13;
the winter season. With regard to tariff study updating, improvements in&#13;
information should be sought regarding load characteristics and the distribution&#13;
system (an ongoing update study, under Bank financing, is addressing this&#13;
issue).&#13;
(e)   The institutional reform of the power sector being implemented by the&#13;
Government should consider the effects on electricity pricing. If a competitive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
market develops at the generation level, particularly if access to and from&#13;
Argentina is feasible, the pricing of regulated suppliers would require close&#13;
tracking of marginal costs.&#13;
(f)   Pricing of oil products is considerably more haphazard. It reveals considerable&#13;
variations in tax levels between products of similar costs. The final price of&#13;
these products to consumers is considerably higher than the full opportunity&#13;
cost of those products, and consequently, subsidies are non-existent.&#13;
However, the price signal is distorted by the tax system, particularly in the&#13;
case of automotive fuels providing incentives for an uneconomic conversion of&#13;
the transportation fleet to diesel fuel.&#13;
(g)   Oil products are a prime candidate for tax reform, mainly by rationalizing&#13;
them and extending a uniform treatment of the value added tax (VAT) to all&#13;
products.&#13;
(h)   The energy pricing system does not create incentives for efficiency&#13;
improvements, since it is based on a cost-plus formula. This is manifested&#13;
partially in UTE by a low customer-to-employee ratio and in ANCAP by a&#13;
high markup for the main oil products which would suggest production and&#13;
distribution inefficiencies.&#13;

1.    Historical Data. UTE's historical data of sales of electricity for the period 1970-93&#13;
are shown in Attachment 1. The analysis of that attachment shows that the average annual&#13;
growth rate of sales of electricity for the past 23 years (1970-93) was 4.3%. However,&#13;
during the recent past (1990-93) the annual growth rate has been much higher, at 6.7%. The&#13;
following table summarizes the growth rates of sales of electricity in the past 23 years:&#13;
Period        Average Annual&#13;
Growth Rate&#13;
1970-75            2.4%&#13;
1975-80            6.9%&#13;
1980-85            2.8%&#13;
1985-90            3.7%&#13;
1990-92            6.7%&#13;
1970-92            4.3%&#13;
2.    Market Structure. The market structure has been reasonably stable, with sales to&#13;
residential customers representing about 46% of total sales, sales to industrial customers&#13;
about 36%, sales to commercial customers about 16%, and lighting about 2%. The&#13;
generation structure has changed considerably over the last two decades (Attachment 2).&#13;
Hydrogeneration increased its share from around 50% in the early 1970s to over 90% in the&#13;
late 1980s. This is due to the commissioning of large hydroplants (Salto Grande and El&#13;
Palmar) during this period. In the future, however, thernal generation should increase its&#13;
participation since all economic hydro sources have been utilized. Exchange of power with&#13;
Brazil and Argentina should also play a much greater role in future power supply.&#13;
3.    Forecast of Future Power Sales. Under the Fifth Power Project (Loan 1779-UR),&#13;
consultants developed satisfactory methodologies to forecast electricity demand based on&#13;
trends and regression analysis. UTE has been using these methodologies to update the&#13;
forecasts of future electricity demand. UTE forecasts separately the three main customer&#13;
categories: residential, industrial and commercial. The coverage in the country is already&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
very high (around 97%) and the population growth rate quite modest (0.5%). Therefore, the&#13;
expected growth in electricity consumption will depend strongly on economic growth. To&#13;
prepare the forecast, it was considered that GDP will grow at 2% per year until 2004. The&#13;
three main categories were analyzed separately, and total sales subsequently projected.&#13;
Finally, UTE considered that losses would be reduced in accordance with a loss reduction&#13;
program agreed with the Bank and that 70% of the actual losses would be transformed into&#13;
additional sales after implementation of the program. Attachment 3 shows the forecast sales&#13;
of energy. The average annual growth forecast for the period is 4.26%, which is compatible&#13;
with past records over a long period.&#13;
4.    Generation Requirements. Generation requirements are obtained from sales&#13;
forecasts, adding forecast losses. Currently the total loss level is high due to technical and&#13;
non-technical losses. The improvements in the distribution network of Montevideo (which&#13;
represents 52.3 % of the sales of electricity) will help reduce the technical losses. UTE will&#13;
implement a program for reducing the non-technical losses. In accordance with both actions&#13;
it is expected to reduce losses to the levels shown in Attachment 3 and, therefore, the&#13;
generation requirements for domestic market would be:&#13;

ANNEX 6&#13;
URUGUAY&#13;
Power Transmission and Distribution Project&#13;
Power Balance&#13;
1.    Existing Generation Facilities. Uruguay's present installed generating capacity&#13;
(including participation in the Salto Grande binational hydroplant) is 1836 MW, of which&#13;
1241 MW is hydroelectric and 595 MW oil-fired thermoelectric. Hydrogeneration is&#13;
supplied by three power plants in Rio Negro (Gabriel Terra, Baygorria, and El Palmar) and&#13;
by Salto Grande. Gabriel Terra is an older plant commissioned in 1948 with 128 MW (four&#13;
units of 32 MW), which is now under rehabilitation (financed under Loan 2622-UR),&#13;
including a change in turbines and complete rewiring of the generators. Upon completion of&#13;
these rehabilitation works (scheduled for 1997) the life of this power plant will be extended&#13;
by an additional 30 years. Baygorria is also an old plant, commissioned in 1961, with 108&#13;
MW (three units of 36 MW), and is under normal operation. UTE plans to rehabilitate&#13;
Baygorria after finishing the works in Gabriel Terra. El Palmar is a new plant&#13;
commissioned in 1982 with 330 MW (three units of 110 MW) and with a good record of&#13;
operation.&#13;
2.    Uruguay has a very small hydro reservoir capacity. The only existing reservoir is&#13;
Gabriel Terra, with capacity for storing the equivalent of 4.5 months of generation. Salto&#13;
Grande has regulating storage capacity for only two weeks and therefore its generation&#13;
strongly depends on the volume of water inflow. UTE has hydrological data going back 82&#13;
years. The hydrological conditions of these rivers are very erratic. During years of average&#13;
water inflow the generating capacity in Rio Negro is around 2,600 GWh, and Uruguay's&#13;
share in Salto Grande is around 3,800 Gwh in average years. However, during dry years the&#13;
generating capacity is substantially reduced to 600 GWh in Rio Negro and to 800 GWh for&#13;
the Salto Grande Uruguayan share. This forces UTE to have a thernal backup to be used&#13;
only in dry years and even to face curtailments in very dry years.&#13;
3.    UTE's thermal installations are concentrated in two sites: Batile Thermoplant and La&#13;
Tablada Thermoplant. Batlle thermoplant has six units which have been installed in different&#13;
years. Units No. 1 and No. 2 are already retired and therefore out of service. Units No. 3&#13;
and No. 4 (50 MW each, steam turbines, oil fired, burning fuel oil) were commissioned in&#13;
1954. These units, in addition to their age, have a very low efficiency (329 gr/kWh), and&#13;
are therefore the last units to be dispatched. Unit No. 5 is an 88 MW unit commissioned in&#13;
1970 with a fuel consumption rate of 262 gr/kWh and a good operational record. Unit No. 6&#13;
is a 125 MW unit commissioned in 1975 with a fuel consumption of 260 gr/kWh and a good&#13;
operational record. Both units 5 and 6 burn fuel oil. In 1992 a fire in this thermoplant&#13;
affected these two units. UTE is therefore rehabilitating them. Unit No. 5 is back to normal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
operation and unit No. 6 (the one most affected) is under repair and scheduled to be in&#13;
operation by the end of 1994. La Tablada thermoplant is a brand new installation&#13;
commissioned in 1992 with 227 MW (two units of 113.5 MW each) consisting of two&#13;
industrial type gas turbines burning diesel oil with a consumption of 270 gr/kWh. In&#13;
addition to these bigger installations UTE also has three small gas turbines (GE, 10 MW;&#13;
BBC, 21 MW, and AA, 24 MW).&#13;
4.    Planning for Generation Expansion. A generation development study through the&#13;
year 2000 (prepared by independent consultants in March 1980, financed under Loan 1779-&#13;
UR) has shown that none of the identified small hydro projects can compete with thernal&#13;
plants. Therefore, future generation expansion in Uruguay should be based on thermnoplants.&#13;
However, the future development of MERCOSUR opens up the possibility of energy&#13;
exchange between Uruguay and Argentina through the already existing 500-kV transmission&#13;
line to Salto Grande, as well as the possibility of importing natural gas from Argentina.&#13;
There is also the prospect of electrical interconnection with Brazil through a possible 500-kV&#13;
transmission line in the future. Annex 3 describes the Energy Options Study to be carried&#13;
out by consultants as part of the preparation of this project. UTE has also contracted&#13;
consultant studies (Southern Electric International, financed under a US Govermuent Grant,&#13;
through the Trade Development Agency) to analyze the technical and economical feasibility&#13;
for the next thermal generation expansion in the Montevideo area, including: (i)&#13;
rehabilitation of the Battle thermal plant, modernizing it and modifying it to burn natural gas&#13;
to be brought from Argentina; (ii) installation of additional capacity (121 MW) in La Tablada&#13;
transforming it into a combined cycle plant; (iii) installation of a combined cycle new&#13;
thermoplant (180 MW) in the area occupied by units 1 and 2 of Batlle plant; and (iv)&#13;
installation of a new combined cycle thermoplant (360 MW) in Greenfield.&#13;
5.    UTE has a hydro-thermal computer simulation model for planning of generation&#13;
capacity developed by consultants under Loan 2484-UR. UTE has also a competent and well&#13;
trained staff able to use this model to carry out simulation studies. UTE has therefore&#13;
prepared an update of the planning studies which defines the least-cost expansion plan for the&#13;
next ten years. The study recommends the installation of 127 MW in La Tablada in 1996&#13;
and 190 MW in Batlle in 1998. These units would be part of a modernization effort in both&#13;
thermoplants to transform them into combined cycle plants burning natural gas, if this fuel is&#13;
available, or oil derivatives otherwise. These studies were analyzed by the Bank and found&#13;
to be satisfactory. UTE has decided to rely on private investments for future power&#13;
generation. Based on studies already completed, an additional 120 MW in gas turbines (in&#13;
1996) will be installed by UTE only if the private sector does not show interest in it.&#13;
Subsequently, UTE plans to call for tenders from investors interested in installing the 180-&#13;
MW combined cycle plant in Batlle y Ordoniez as an Independent Power Producer (IPP) to&#13;
sell its generation to UTTE. This decision does not change the economics of the previous&#13;
planning.&#13;
6.    Power Balance. Using the simulation model referred to in para. 5 above and the&#13;
generation requirements defined in Annex 5 (Power Market), UTE prepared the power&#13;

ANNEX 8&#13;
URUGUAY&#13;
Power Transmission and Distribution Project&#13;
Plan of Action to Improve Efficiency&#13;
1.     UTE will implement a Plan of Action to Improve UTE's Efficiency. The plan will&#13;
comprise four main areas of action: (a) creation of Business Units (BUs); (b) improvement of&#13;
human resource productivity; (c) revision and reduction of administrative expenses; and (d)&#13;
improvement of UTE's internal supervision.&#13;
2.     Attachment 1 to this Annex describes the different steps required to complied with&#13;
the Plan, UTE's unit responsible for carrying out the activity, the monitoring system to&#13;
verify compliance of the plan, and the corresponding timetable. The Plan comprises the&#13;
following areas:&#13;
(a) Business Units: UTE would be divided into different cost centers with separate&#13;
accounting for personnel, assets, and physical facilities for each activity currently&#13;
carried out by UTE. The existing accounting system would be split and adapted to&#13;
each of these separated units. In principle, UTE would be divided into the following&#13;
Business Units: generation, transmission, distribution (by zones, if possible),&#13;
forestry activities, pole factory, transformer repair workshop, and external consultant&#13;
services.&#13;
(b) Improvement of Staff Productivity: In addition to the staff that could be&#13;
redeployed or could leave the company as a consequence of UTE's restructuring,&#13;
UTE would implement an incentive plan for voluntary retirement and separation.&#13;
The plan of action will include a revision of the existing program of recruitment of&#13;
temporary staff (university students), and will also aim at reducing staffing by&#13;
attrition and by freezing recruitment. It will, as well, restructure the staff profile&#13;
through internal recruitment and training.&#13;
(c) Revision and Reduction of Administrative Expenses: UTE will carry out the&#13;
following activities: (a) take all necessary measures to reduce UTE's administrative&#13;
expenses; and (b) review the calculation of administrative expenses charged to&#13;
operations. Currently, 100% of headquarters expenses of those areas not related to&#13;
operations, other than construction and engineering activities, are charged as&#13;
operating expenses. UTE will prepare a study to: (i) revise the existing&#13;
methodology to calculate administrative expenses; and (ii) propose a new&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
methodology to allocate administrative expenses to the various operating and&#13;
investment categories.&#13;
(d) Improvement of UTE's Internal Supervision: UTE's management will develop a&#13;
monitoring system to supervise the implementation of the Plan of Action. In addition,&#13;
it will strengthen UTE's internal supervision, through the establishment of a task&#13;
force composed of key high level staff, which will prepare a report with&#13;
recommendations and a timetable to improve internal control. The task force should&#13;
review: management and staffing capability and skill of the internal audit unit (IAU);&#13;
its performance and communication channels with top management and the rest of the&#13;
utility; and the IAU's objectives and its operating procedures.&#13;

ANNEX 9&#13;
URUGUAY&#13;
Power Transmission and Distribution Project&#13;
Financial Performance&#13;
General&#13;
1.    Financial projections for UTE have been prepared in current prices and are expressed&#13;
in US$ million.&#13;
2.    Financial projections are based on a financial projection model prepared during the&#13;
project cycle, which includes three main modules: financing of the investment program,&#13;
evolution of the existing liability and debt service, and financial statement projections. These&#13;
programs produce more than 40 pages of financial tables, which are included in the Project&#13;
File. UTE has started using these programs for its financial planning.&#13;
3.    The financial statements show UTE's consolidated financial situation for the period&#13;
1994-2003, although UTE would be divided into business units, as described in Annexes 2&#13;
and 8. The financial projections assume that 125-MW gas turbines will be installed by UITE&#13;
in 1996, and that further generation requirements would be installed and operated by the&#13;
private sector. This scenario depends on the results of the Energy Options Study currently&#13;
carried out by UTE with the assistance of consultants (see Annex 3).&#13;
Income Forecast&#13;
4.    Energy sales. Domestic energy sales are based on the report on the demand&#13;
projection study prepared by UTE, dated May 1993. It considered an average 4.3 % sales&#13;
growth during the period, assuming a reduction of power losses from 18% in 1994 to 14% in&#13;
2003. The surplus energy is sold as export sales to Argentina. It is expected that all surplus&#13;
would be brought by Argentina since it was considered a price of 50% of Argentina spot&#13;
market price.&#13;
5.    Tariff. The power revenues are based on existing tariffs as of January 1994, which&#13;
have been maintained constant in real terms during the period, as they are in line with the&#13;
marginal cost of production. Tariffs of export sales, due to the thermal generation, are based&#13;
on the economic cost determined by the Argentine spot market, and energy sales derived&#13;
from hydro generation are based on 50% of the prices in the Argentine spot market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
6.     Other operating revenues: estimated at 6.6%  of gross operating revenues due to&#13;
energy sales per annum.&#13;
7.     Personnel costs: are based on the implementation of the Plan of Action to improve&#13;
UTE's efficiency (see Annex 8), to be agreed with the Bank at negotiations. In particular, in&#13;
1994 it includes US$5.0 million due to payment for voluntary retirement. Additionally, it&#13;
assumes that the total UTE staff will reach about 8,000 employees at the end of the period.&#13;
8.     Fuel cost: are derived from UTE's computer simulation of the system's operation.&#13;
Fuel prices are calculated on the basis of existing prices as of January 1994, and maintained&#13;
constant in real terms during the period. The projection of fuel consumption (in millions of&#13;
barrels for fuel oil and diesel) is shown in the following table:&#13;
1995   1996   1997   1998   1999  2000   2001   2002   2003&#13;
Fuel oil  2.88   2.69   2.72   2.67   2.56   2.72   2.61   2.59   2.58&#13;
Diesel    0.10   0.10   0.17   0.02   0.29   0.24   0.51   0.37   0.37&#13;
9.     Energy purchased: this mainly corresponds to the energy purchased from Salto&#13;
Grande at 1.65 USC/kWh, and imports from Argentina at around 3 to 5 USC/kWh.&#13;
1995   1996   1997   1998   1999   2000  2001   2002   2003&#13;

10.    Operation and maintenance expenses: assumes 15 % of gross revenues.&#13;
11.    Administrative expenses: are projected as 3.2%  of gross revenues.&#13;
12.    Depreciation. UTE's average depreciation rate varies with the composition of assets&#13;
entering into operation. Existing assets as of December 31, 1993, have been depreciated at&#13;
2.2%, and future transmission, distribution, and thermal generation facilities have been&#13;
depreciated at 3.3%.&#13;
13.    Taxes. UTE pays custom duties and VAT (22%) taxes. UTE is exempted from&#13;
payment of taxes on fuel purchased from ANCAP and energy purchased from Salto Grande.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
14.   Other non-operational income (expenses): are projected assuming a reduction of 1 %&#13;
per year over the historic average of the last three years.&#13;
15.   Income taxes. UTE is charged a 30% tax on income, after discounting interest&#13;
charges and 40 % of the total investment program.&#13;
16.   Government Appropriation: based on Law 16170, Art. 643, which allows UTE to&#13;
transfer to the Treasury its cash surpluses. It is calculated as the difference among gross&#13;
operating revenues plus IMESI (impuesto especffico interno) plus non-operating revenues less&#13;
cash operating expenses, debt service, capital expenditure not financed by borrowing, and a&#13;
reasonable amount for working capital.&#13;
Flow of Funds&#13;
17.   Investment program. Except for the 125-MW gas turbines to be installed in 1996, no&#13;
further generation facilities would be implemented by UTE. New generation required for the&#13;
domestic market is assumed to be installed by the private sector. Annex 6 provides more&#13;
details.&#13;
18.   Financing of investment program. See characteristics of existing loans and credits in&#13;
Attachment 4 to this Annex. Terms of the proposed IDB loan are assumed to be 20 years&#13;
including 5 years of grace, a 0.75 % commitment fee, and a 7.5 % interest rate. Another&#13;
IBRD loan is being considered during 2001-2003. No further loans have been considered.&#13;
A Banco de la Republica Oriental del Uruguay (BROU) credit has been considered to finance&#13;
the deficit: terms of 5 years and 8 % interest.&#13;
19.   IMESI. A 10% tax is charged to domestic sales, from which UTE retains 50%, and&#13;
the other 50% is transferred to the Treasury.&#13;
Balance Statement&#13;
20.   Accounts receivable: are based on 22 days of billing for private customers, and two&#13;
months for government agencies and export. Existing arrears from Government agencies&#13;
(US$30 million) are expected to be paid during the period 1994-1999.&#13;
21.   Inventory for operations: projected as 3% of fixed assets in operation.&#13;
22.   Accounts payable: are estimated as the percentage of cash operating expenses, and&#13;
local costs of the investment program.&#13;

ANNEX 11&#13;
URUGUAY&#13;
Power Transmission and Distribution Project&#13;
Project Description and Costs&#13;
The proposed project would consist of:&#13;
(a)   Modification of 500-kV Substations -- consisting of the expansion of&#13;
substations I in Montevideo and San Carlos in Punta del Este through the&#13;
installation of two power transforners (250 MVA 500/150 kV each) reactive&#13;
power control devices and the related switchgear equipment in each of these&#13;
substations, and installation of new 500 kV line bay in substations A and B.&#13;
The estimated cost of this component is:&#13;
Local       - US$ 16.2 million&#13;
Foreign     - US$ 23.0 million&#13;
Total        US$ 39.2 million&#13;
(b)   Expansion of the 150-kV Transmission System in Montevideo -- consisting of&#13;
the replacement of the switchgear equipment (breakers and switches) and&#13;
reinforcement of grounding system of the substations of 150 kV to make them&#13;
appropriate to the new short circuit requirements of the system, the expansion&#13;
of substations E and J, the installation of a new substation G (2 x 63 MVA,&#13;
150/22 kV, SF6 insulated), changing the cable of existing transmission line&#13;
(150 kV) between substations A and N, and the installation of about 25 km of&#13;
150-kV underground cables interconnecting substations (N-E, E-J, E-R, R-G,&#13;
R-I). This would make the switching equipment of substations A, B, C, E, F,&#13;
H, and N compatible with the new short-circuit level of the 150-kV system&#13;
due to the increase caused by the reinforcement of the transmission system.&#13;
Also the grounding grids of those substations would be improved to support&#13;
the new short-circuit level. To achieve the objectives of the renovation of the&#13;
distribution system, it was agreed between the Bank and UTE during project&#13;
preparation that the modification of voltage levels would be carried out in the&#13;
areas supplied by substations G, R, and L. The transformers 150/30 kV in&#13;
substations K, R, and L would be transferred to substations N, C, and E, to&#13;
substitute existing transformers at retirement time. In addition UTE would&#13;
buy four additional transformers 150/30 kV to expand substations N, C, and E&#13;
(and one for reserve). The 150/22 kV transformers for the substations&#13;
included in the proposed project would be funded under Loan 3221-UR.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
Local       - US$ 19.5 million&#13;
Foreign     - US$ 25.0 million&#13;
Total        US$ 44.5 million&#13;
(c)   First Phase of Renovation of the Montevideo Distribution System -- including&#13;
a change of the medium voltage (22 kV) system and of the low voltage&#13;

Power Transmission and Distribution Project&#13;
Project Implementation Plan&#13;
1.    The Project&#13;
1.1   Project Objectives. The proposed project aims to improve the reliability of the&#13;
electricity service at least cost and to facilitate the sustainability of the reforms recently&#13;
implemented in the power sector by helping UTE to adapt to the new institutional&#13;
framework. Project objectives include: (i) consolidating sector reforms; (ii) improving&#13;
power distribution reliability; (iii) improving efficient use of energy; and (iv) improving&#13;
customer safety.&#13;
1.2   Project Description. This project would be the first part of a staged approach to&#13;
modernize the Montevideo distribution network. The renovation of the Montevideo&#13;
distribution network recommended by the consultant's studies will result in very large&#13;
investment and it is recommended to be implemented in several phases. The proposed&#13;
project would cover the first phase which would renovate the areas of the city under the&#13;
influence of substations G, L, and R. This would cover the most critical areas in the city&#13;
and would be followed by additional areas to be renovated under a possible IDB project.&#13;
This proposed project would also include the reinforcement, adaptation and expansion of the&#13;
transmission system to allow the renovation of the distribution system as well as the power&#13;
supply for market growth. The proposed project would therefore include:&#13;
(a)   modification of 500-kV substations -- consisting of the expansion of substations&#13;
I in Montevideo and San Carlos in Punta del Este through the installation of&#13;
two power transformers (250 MVA 500/150 kV each), reactive power control&#13;
devices and the related switchgear equipment in each of these substations, and&#13;
the installation of new 500-kV line bays in substations A and B;&#13;
(b)   expansion of the 150-kV transmission system in Montevideo -- consisting of&#13;
the replacement of the switchgear equipment (breakers and switches) and&#13;
reinforcement of grounding system of the substations of 150 kV to make them&#13;
appropriate to the new short circuit requirements of the system, the expansion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -&#13;
of substations E and J, the installation of a new substation G, and the&#13;
installation of about 26 km of 150 kV underground cables interconnecting&#13;
substations;&#13;
(c)   First phase of the renovation of Montevideo Distribution System including&#13;
voltage change of the middle voltage (22 kV) system and of the low voltage&#13;
(380/220 Volts) system -- consisting of installation of a completely new system&#13;
in the areas of influence of substations G, L and R;&#13;
(d)   technical assistance -- consisting of consultant services to help UTE to&#13;
restructure in business units as part of the sector reforms, to implement the&#13;
Non-Technical Losses Reduction Program, to help UTE to develop load&#13;
characteristics studies for marginal cost studies and for load management&#13;
actions, to help UTE to up-date its marginal cost studies, to prepare and&#13;
implement a demand-side management program and to help project&#13;
implementation; and&#13;
(e)   training -- a training program consisting of: (i) a managerial seminar to train&#13;
UTE's managers for the new power sector structure; (ii) seminars for UTE's&#13;
staff on the new sector structure and UTE's changing role; (iii) environmental&#13;
aspects to strengthen UTE's environmental unit.&#13;
1.3   Pro*ect Costs. The total project cost, excluding interest during construction, is&#13;
estimated at US$196.5 million, of which US$125.0 million would be foreign cost. Costs are&#13;
expressed in June 1994 prices and are based on experience with similar projects in the&#13;
country and abroad. Physical contingencies are 5 % of base cost for the transmission&#13;
component and 10% of base cost for the distribution and technical assistance components.&#13;
Price contingencies assume: (i) a project execution period of 6 years; and (ii) price escalation&#13;
rates on base costs and physical contingencies of 2.0% in 1995, 2.5% in 1996, 2.7% in&#13;
1997, 2.5% in 1998, 2.6% in 1999, and 2.7% in 2000-01. Variations in exchange rate&#13;
would compensate for the difference between the local and international inflation rates.&#13;
1.4   The cost estimate for the project is summarized in the following table:&#13;

1.5   Project Financing The total financing requirements (including interest during&#13;
construction of US$31.5 million equivalent), are estimated at US$228 million equivalent.&#13;
The Bank would finance the foreign component of goods, the technical assistance and the&#13;
training program. UTE would finance the local costs and interest during construction. The&#13;
financing scheme of the proposed project, therefore, would be as follows:&#13;
Local J   Foreign     Total&#13;
UTE                        71.5       31.5      103.0&#13;

2.    Implementation Arrangements&#13;
The project would be coordinated within UTE by a project coordinator, with the help&#13;
of a full-time project unit. Directors for each project component (Transmission,&#13;
Distribution, and Training) with qualifications satisfactory to the Bank would be appointed.&#13;
The project coordinator and the project directors would work within the framework of UTE's&#13;
organization with the assistance of the project unit, and of procurement, construction,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -&#13;
engineering, and finances units. UTE would keep the project unit in place during project&#13;
implementation. The project coordinator and the project directors would be qualified&#13;
professionals who would not be replaced without consultation with the Bank. MIE would&#13;
appoint a coordinator for the implementation of the sector institutional framework reforms.&#13;

3.3   Schedule of Disbursements. Attachment 4 shows the schedule of disbursements of&#13;
the proceeds of the Bank Loan and of the counterpart local funds.&#13;
3.4   Project Risks. The project has no special technical risks. The political risk is also&#13;
modest, since there is legislative authority for all envisaged institutional reform actions. In&#13;
addition, the Presidential Decrees creating the Energy Technical Commission was enacted as&#13;
a condition of negotiations and the Decree creating the regulatory system would be enacted&#13;
as one condition of effectiveness. Risks of implementation delays have been minimized by&#13;
drafting bidding documents for procurement of the most important items and by preparing&#13;
terms of reference for hiring consultants before appraisal. UTE will also hire consultants to&#13;
assist with project implementation, reducing the risks of delays even further.&#13;
3.5    Critical Factors Affecting Project Success and Actions to Address them. The most&#13;
critical factor that could affect project success is the adequate planning of renovation works&#13;
in distribution to avoid large interruptions of service to customers. The renovation works of&#13;
the distribution network will reconstruct completely the distribution system in the selected&#13;
areas of the city. This could result in long periods of power supply interruption during&#13;
implementation of works if the planning of activities is not adequate and made sufficiently in&#13;
advance. To address this issue, UTE has aready contracted SwedPower, the same&#13;
consulting firm that carried out the feasibility study of the renovation of the distribution&#13;
network to prepare all planning strategy for the renovation services. In addition, UTE will&#13;
hire specialized consultants to help UTE implement the renovation at least during the first&#13;
two years of work. It was also taken a conservative approach for implementation of works&#13;
which will be done only in one area at a time. Therefore, IJTE will begin the second phase&#13;
of the renovation (possibly funded by IDB) when areas supplied by substations "R" and "L"&#13;
will be completed.&#13;

Monitoring Indicators&#13;
1.    Indicators: The following indicators would be used during project supervision to&#13;
monitor UTE performance:&#13;
A) Availability Factor for Each Power Plant: defined (in %) as:&#13;
AF= (SUM (Pu * Td))/(Pp * 8760) where&#13;
SUM = Sum sign&#13;
Pu = Generating Capacity of Each Unit&#13;
Td = Number of Hours the Unit was Available during the Year&#13;
Pp = Plant Generating Capacity&#13;
B) Reserve Margin: defined as the percentage of total installed capacity to be kept as&#13;
minimum difference between installed capacity and expected peak load.&#13;
C) Average Number of Interruptions per Customer: defined as the ratio between the number&#13;
of interruptions of power supply during one year and the number of customers at the end of&#13;
that year.&#13;
D) Average Time of Interruption per Customer: defined as the ratio between the total number&#13;
of hours of the year when service was interrupted and the total number of customers affected&#13;
by those interruptions.&#13;
E) Total Losses: defined as the ratio:&#13;
Loss = (NG-OC-S)/TG, where&#13;
Loss  = losses&#13;
NG    = Net Generation&#13;
OC    = Self Consumption in UTE's facilities&#13;
S     = Sales&#13;
TG    = Total Generation&#13;
F) Staffing: defined as the ratio between the number of customers at the end of the year and&#13;
the number of UTE's employees at the same date.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 102 -&#13;
G)    Tariff:  defined as ratio between annual gross revenue (US$ million) and annual&#13;
energy sales (GWh);&#13;
H)    Receivables: defined as the number of days of an average collection period (total&#13;
accounts receivable divided by annual gross revenue from sales);&#13;
I)     Cash Operating Ratio: defined as the ratio between total cash operating expenses and&#13;
total gross revenues. Total cash operating expenses refer to all expenses related to&#13;
operations, including operation, maintenance and administrative expenses, taxes and&#13;
payments in lieu of taxes, but excluding provision for depreciation, income taxes,&#13;
and other non-cash operating charges, interest and other charges on debts. Gross&#13;
operating revenues refer to revenues from all sources related to operations.&#13;
J)     Self-financing ratio: defined as the ratio between funds from internal sources and&#13;
capital expenditure. Funds from internal sources are the difference between the sum&#13;
of revenues from all sources, excluding borrowing, and the sum of all expenses&#13;
related to operations, debt service requirements, income taxes, transfers to Treasury,&#13;
excluding provision for depreciation and other non-cash operating charges. Capital&#13;
expenditures means the sum of all expenditures incurred on account of fixed assets,&#13;
including interest charged to construction;&#13;
K)    Debt service Coverage. defined as the ratio between gross internal cash generation&#13;
(excluding customer contribution and consumer deposits) and total debt service&#13;
requirements&#13;

ANNEX 14&#13;
URUGUAY&#13;
Power Transmission and Distribution Project&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
1.    UTE's expansion plan was prepared based on an average annual expected load&#13;
growth of 4.26% for the next ten years, which is considered appropriate (see Annex 5). The&#13;
generation expansion plan was based on a power balance study prepared by UTE which the&#13;
Bank found satisfactory, and on a feasibility study prepared by Southern Electric&#13;
International (Feasibility Study of Units 3 and 4 Batlle y Ordoiiez Power Station and&#13;
Expansion of La Tablada Power Station) under a grant from the US Government. The&#13;
transmission system expansion plan was based on a consultant study prepared by UTE with&#13;
the help of MARTE Engenharia (Obras de Trasmisi6n, Comunicaciones y Telecontrol -&#13;
Periodo 1994/2000 - Expansion Plan for Transmission, Telecommunications and Telecontrol&#13;
Systems for Period 1994-2000), financed under Loan 3221-UR. The renovation of the&#13;
distribution system was recommended by a consultant study prepared by Fitchner (Estudio de&#13;
Distribuci6n de Energia) financed under Loan 2484-UR, and confirmed by an additional&#13;
study prepared by SwedPower (Consulting Services for Feasibility Studies of New Topology&#13;
of the Distribution System for UTE Montevideo) under a grant from the Swedish&#13;
Government. The Bank has reviewed these studies and found them satisfactory. Based on&#13;
the studies performed, the Bank was assured that UTE's expansion plan represents the least-&#13;
cost solution for the required system expansion.&#13;
2.    The proposed project includes investments in two different areas: (i) transmission&#13;
expansion to allow an adequate supply of electricity to an expanding market; and (ii)&#13;
renovation of the distribution system in three areas in the city of Montevideo to improve&#13;
reliability, reduce technical losses, and extend the life of the power system. It is difficult to&#13;
separate accurately the benefits resulting from each of these investments from the general&#13;
benefits resulting from the investment program. However, to avoid doubt, a conservative&#13;
approach was utilized in the economic analysis of the project. Under this approach two&#13;
different rate of return were calculated: first, the rate of return of the renovation of the&#13;
distribution system of Montevideo; and second, the rate of return of the entire investment&#13;
program for the period 1995-2003.&#13;
3.    The internal rate of return of the renovation of the distribution system was computed&#13;
as the discount rate equalizing the present value of the cost streams and benefits associated&#13;
with it. The cost stream (in 1994 constant prices) comprises the capital cost of the&#13;
renovation equipment and works (excluding taxes and duties) for the entire distribution&#13;
system in Montevideo, the operational and maintenance costs and the upstream cost&#13;
(generation and transmission) of energy supplied, for the condition with and without the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 105 -&#13;
renovation. The benefits were measured by the consumer willingness to pay the unsupplied&#13;
energy in the "without project" scenario calculated at its lower bound value as the cost of&#13;
unsupplied energy at the current tariff. The amount of unsupplied energy was estimated as&#13;
the unserved energy by the existing system due to its capacity limitations. This is a&#13;
conservative estimate since the unserved energy due to service interruptions was not&#13;
included. The proposed project would finance only the first phase of this renovation;&#13;
however, no attempt was made to evaluate the economic rate of return of this separate part&#13;
of the system because the renovation in question will, in fact, install a complete new system&#13;
with different voltage levels. Therefore, the only justification to implement the first phase is&#13;
as part of the renovation of the whole system. To analyze the influence of this investment&#13;
decision an alternative case was considered and the internal rate of return was computed&#13;
using the cost stream at market level investments costs, i.e., including taxes and duties (to&#13;
analyze the decision from a corporate point of view). Also to analyze the influence of&#13;
variation in the assumptions, a sensitivity analysis was carried out. The results of these&#13;
analyses are:&#13;
Internal Rate of Return&#13;
Scenario                 Distribution Renovation&#13;
1. Base Case                         25.1%&#13;
2. Investments     10% higher        23.1 %&#13;
3. Benefits        10% lower          19.1%&#13;
4. Benefits        10% higher        31.2%&#13;
5. Benefits        10% lower&#13;
and Investments  10% higher        17.7%&#13;
6. Investments    30% higher         20.1%&#13;
7. Alternative case&#13;
(Investments at market values)     19.2%&#13;
8. Alternative Case (market values)&#13;
with Investments  10% higher       17.8%&#13;
9. Alternative Case (market values)&#13;
with Benefits    10% lower         14.6%&#13;
4.    The rate of return of UTE's investment program for period 1995-2003 is 15.4%. It&#13;
was computed at a discount rate equalizing the present value of the stream of costs and&#13;
benefits associated with UTE's expansion plan. The cost stream, in constant 1994 prices,&#13;
comprises the capital cost of the investment program (excluding taxes and duties) and the&#13;
associated incremental operational and maintenance costs. Revenues derived from&#13;
incremental sales were used as a proxy for benefits. The benefit stream represents revenues&#13;
generated by the investment program using average tariffs, also in constant prices, and&#13;
assuming that these benefits are attributed to the program at 50% in 1995, 60% in 1996,&#13;
70% in 1997, 80% in 1998 and 100% from 1999 on. Other benefits to the society and the&#13;
economy of the country -- such as those derived from improvement of service quality to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 106 -&#13;
customers and availability of energy -- were not included in this analysis. If social benefits&#13;
were included, the rate of return would be higher.&#13;
5.    Sensitivity analyses were carried out to evaluate the impact on the base case internal&#13;
rate of return as a result of variations in key parameters. The results of these analyses were:&#13;

ANNEX 15&#13;
URUGUAY&#13;
Power Transmission and Distribution Project&#13;
Environmental Aspects&#13;
1.    General. UTE's Environmental study area is very new and was created as a condition&#13;
of Loan 3221-UR. UTE's organization includes one Environment Unit (UGA-Unidad de&#13;
Gesti6n Ambiental) reporting to the General Manager (responsible for preparing the&#13;
Environmental studies for future installations, motivating the operational units to address&#13;
environmental problems in operating facilities, and acting as a nucleus for the creation of&#13;
adequate capability in the environmental field within the company) and operational&#13;
environment units in each operating department (responsible for implementation in its area of&#13;
the recommendations received from the Environment Unit).&#13;
2.    UGA Training Program. The proposed project would finance a training program for&#13;
UGA staff. This training program will focus on training each of UGA's staff in their&#13;
respective areas of responsibility. It will include on-the-job training through agreements with&#13;
other utilities with more experience on environment matters, university courses, and transfer&#13;
of knowledge from individual consultants.&#13;
3.    Environmental Assessment of UTE. Under Loan 3221-UR financing, UTE hired a&#13;
consultant in accordance with TOR satisfactory to the Bank to make an assessment of the&#13;
environmental situation of UTE's facilities, and recommendations on the organization, work&#13;
program, and training needs of UTE's environmental area. The recommendations of the&#13;
report cover: (i) organization of UGA, (ii) training for UGA staff, (iii) thernoplants, (iv)&#13;
hydroplants, (v) transmission lines, and (vi) substations. The Bank reviewed these&#13;
recommendations and agreed with UTE on a restructuring of UGA that took place in January&#13;
1995. Also benefiting from this proposed project UTE hired a consultant that prepared a&#13;
satisfactory environmental analysis of UTE's planned transmission program.&#13;
4.    The Bank would help UTE to strengthen its environmental unit. Based on the results&#13;
of this assessment study, UTE has restructured the Environmental Unit covering its&#13;
objectives, functions and organization, as well as procedures for incorporating environmental&#13;
concerns in the sector. UTE also agreed to implement a training program on environmental&#13;
subjects.&#13;
5.    The Project. The proposed project consists in its major part of works for the&#13;
renovation and substitution of existing facilities. The expansion of the 500 kV system will&#13;
comprise the installation of transformers in already existing sub-stations. Therefore no&#13;
environmental effect is foreseen. The modification of the 150-kV system will comprise&#13;
change of equipment in already existing sub-stations, the installation of a compact substation&#13;
(SF6 enclosed), and installation of underground cables connecting substations, therefore with&#13;
no environmental effects. The modernization of the distribution network will consist of&#13;
replacing old cables by new ones at the same site.&#13;

            The Power Transmission and Distribution
            Project aims to improve the reliability of the electricity
            service at least cost and to promote the sustainability of
            the reforms recently implemented in the power sector by
            helping the National Power Company (UTE) to adapt to the new
            institutional framework. Project objectives include: 1)
            consolidating sector reforms; 2) consolidating UTE's
            institutional improvements; 3) improving power distribution
            reliability; 4) promoting more efficient use of energy; and
            5) improving customer safety. This project will be the first
            part of a staged approach to modernize the Montevideo
            distribution network and it includes: 1) modification of
            500-kV substations; 2) expansion of the 150-kV transmission
            system in Montevideo; 3) first phase of the renovation of
            the Montevideo distribution system including voltage change
            of the medium voltage system and of the low voltage system;
            4) technical assistance; and 5) training.
