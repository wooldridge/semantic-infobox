TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
SECrION A: DETAILED PROJECr DESCRIPTION&#13;
Background&#13;
1.     The Tanzania Power VI project was approved in 1993 (Credit 2489-TA), and has funded&#13;
the construction of a 180 MWV hydroelectric facility in south central Tanzania. The facility,&#13;
located in the Lower Kihansi Gorge, is operated by the Tanzania Electric Supply Company&#13;
(Tanesco). The Lower Kihansi facility started producing power in December 1999, and&#13;
currently, three turbines are in operation.&#13;
2.      The Lower Kihansi Hydropower Project is a run-of-the-river operation. The scheme&#13;
incorporates a 25 m high dam, which results in the inundation of about 26 ha when the reservoir&#13;
is full.' The dam diverts water into a tunnel which leads to the power generating station. The&#13;
project takes advantage of the change in elevation through the Kihansi Gorge, which drops&#13;
nearly 900 meters over 3 km. The water is returned to the river about 6 km downstream.&#13;
3.      An Environmental Assessment of the project was carried out in 1992, and Government&#13;
agreed to prepare and implement an Environmental Management Plan. Because of the small size&#13;
of the inundation area, the environmental impact of the dam was expected to be minimal. The&#13;
Management Plan focused primarily on mitigating the upstream impacts on the inundation area&#13;
and on the communities living in the vicinity of the project. A series of Baseline Studies and a&#13;
long-term ecological monitoring program was financed by the project. By late 1995, it was&#13;
concluded that - contrary to earlier views - the diversion of water for the hydroelectric scheme&#13;
was likely to have an environmental impact on vegetation on both sides of the 6 km stretch of the&#13;
river which passed through the Gorge. In particular, the Baseline studies demonstrated the&#13;
importance of the fine spray from the Kihansi Falls for maintaining the microclimate in the&#13;
Gorge ecosystem.2&#13;
The reservoir has a total capacity of around 1.6 million m3, and the water detention time is around 12 hours. The power&#13;
project was originally designed to provide power to meet peak load demands, but is now operated in a manner which&#13;
provides base load.&#13;
2   The maintenance of sufficient flows through the Gorge to conserve the ecosystem was considered in the recently completed&#13;
Power Sector Master Plan (Acres International, November 2000) which concluded that maintenance of a 2 mV/second&#13;
bypass flow reduces average projected power production at Kihansi by 11 percent; 4 m3/second bypass flow reduces&#13;
average projected power production by 23 percent; and 7 m3/second bypass flow reduces average projected power&#13;
production by 40 percent. The corresponding reduced total system average production would be 4, 8, and 13 percent&#13;
respectively, representing possibly significant investments in generating capacity to account for these shortfalls.&#13;

Project Area&#13;
The Eastern Arc Mountains&#13;
4.    The Lower Kihansi Gorge is located in the Eastern Arc Mountains. The Eastern Arc&#13;
Mountains are a group of mountains which stretch from southeast Kenya through south central&#13;
Tanzania and are situated between 3020' and 8Â°45'S latitude and 35037' and 38048' E longitude.&#13;
They consist of the Taita Hills in Kenya, and the Pare, Usambara, Nguru, Ukaguru, Rubeho,&#13;
Uluguru, Mahenge, Malundwe, and Udzungwa Mountains in Tanzania. Their age, geologic&#13;
origin, and proximity to the Indian Ocean are features which separate them from other highland&#13;
regions in East Africa. These same features have also contributed to their very diverse and&#13;
unique biota, which is quite distinct from the adjacent savannah and woodland habitats in East&#13;
Africa.&#13;
5.    The total area of natural forest in the Eastern Arc is approximately 5,344 km2 or 0.6&#13;
percent of the area of Tanzania. The Udzungwa Mountains contain the greatest area of natural&#13;
forest followed by the Nguru, Uluguru, Rubeho, and East Usambara Mountains. Nearly three-&#13;
quarters of the remaining natural forest in the Eastern Arc is open forest - forest in which the&#13;
canopy is not intact and contiguous.&#13;
6.    The total area of closed forest - forest in which the canopy is generally intact and&#13;
contiguous - in the Eastern Arc is slightly more than 1,451 km2 or approximately 0.2 percent of&#13;
the area of Tanzania. The Udzungwa and East and West Usambara Mountains contain the&#13;
greatest amount of closed forest. Species diversity and endemism is higher in closed, rather than&#13;
in open, natural forest in the Eastern Arc Mountains.&#13;
7.    The Eastern Arc forests have the highest known number of plant and animal species of&#13;
any region in Tanzania. Approximately 27 percent of the plant species, 63 percent of the&#13;
linyphiid spider species, 43 percent of butterfly species, 33 percent of amphibian species, 37&#13;
percent of the reptile species, 37 percent of the bird species, and 34 percent of the mammal&#13;
species found in Tanzania occur in these forests.&#13;
8.   In addition to being species rich, what is particularly striking about the Eastern Arc is the&#13;
unusually high rate of species endemicity. The Eastern Arc contains one of the highest&#13;
proportions of endemic species of any region worldwide. Of the known species occurring within&#13;
the Eastern Arc, approximately 23 percent of montane plant species, 82 percent of linyphiid&#13;
spider species, 39 percent of the butterflies species, 63 percent of the forest dependent amphibian&#13;
species, 68 percent of the forest dependent reptile species, 3 percent of the bird species, and 6&#13;
percent of the mammal species are endemic.&#13;
9.    Over the last 2,000 years, the Eastern Arc has lost over three-quarters of its original forest&#13;
cover, estimated at around 23,300 km2. Much of this loss has occurred during the last 200 years&#13;
due to a dramatic increase in human population and technological change. The Eastern Arc&#13;
Mountains that have suffered the highest proportional losses of original forest cover are the Taita&#13;
Hills, Ukaguru, Mahenge, and Nguru Mountains.&#13;
&#13;

Technical Annex&#13;
10.   The Eastern Arc is also the habitat for the majority of the globally critically endangered,&#13;
endangered, and vulnerable mammal, bird, and tree species found in mainland Tanzania. Eighty-&#13;
six percent of all mammal species and 90 percent of all bird species listed by IUCN (1996) as&#13;
either critically endangered, endangered, or vulnerable in mainland Tanzania are found in the&#13;
Eastern Arc forests. Furthermore, approximately 52 percent of the globally threatened tree&#13;
species occurring in Tanzania are found in the Eastern Arc Mountains.&#13;
11.   As a result of the extensive threats facing the Eastern Arc forests and their exceptionally&#13;
high concentrations of endemic species, the Eastern Arc and the coastal forests of Tanzania and&#13;
southern Kenya have been identified as one of the 25 most threatened ecosystems worldwide -&#13;
one of the so-called global biodiversity hot spots. The Eastern Arc Mountains and coastal forests&#13;
of Tanzania and Kenya have the highest ratio of endemic plant and vertebrate species per 100&#13;
km2 of all 25 biodiversity hot spots.&#13;
Kihansi Gorge Ecosystem&#13;
12.   The Kihansi gorge is located in the Eastern Arc, along the eastern escarpment of the&#13;
southern Udzungwa Mountains. The gorge, created by the Kihansi River is approximately 4 km&#13;
in length and 0.5 km in width. The Kihansi River, as it flows through the gorge, plunges over a&#13;
series of waterfalls and rapids. The main Upper Falls at the head of the steeped-sided gorge is&#13;
over 100 m in height and the Lower Falls is approximately 30 m in height. There are several&#13;
other smaller falls in the gorge which are between 10 and 30 m in height.&#13;
13.   The gorge contains four major vegetation types: miombo woodland, montane forest,&#13;
Filicium forest, and wetland spray meadow with a respective area of approximately 95 ha, 100&#13;
ha, 0.25 ha, and 2.0 ha.&#13;
14.   More than 23 plant species occur in the Kihansi gorge that are either globally threatened&#13;
or are species having regional and global conservation importance. Three of these species - a&#13;
wild coffee (Coffea sp.), a species in the Acanthaceae family, and species in the Triuridaceae&#13;
family - are known only from the Kihansi Gorge and have not yet been formally described.&#13;
While it is possible that these three species occur outside of the Kihansi Gorge, further field&#13;
work is needed to establish their distribution and abundance.&#13;
15.   Sixteen bird species occur in the Kihansi Gorge that are of conservation concern. Seven&#13;
of these species are globally or regionally threatened or near-threatened. All of these species&#13;
have much large populations outside of the Gorge. If local populations of these species within&#13;
the gorge were to become extinct, it should not affect the global populations of these species&#13;
because of the very small size of the Kihansi Gorge populations.&#13;
16.   Six species of primate occur in the Kihansi Gorge. Of these species, the Uhehehe Red&#13;
Colubus is of conservation concern. The Uhehehe Red Colubus has much large populations&#13;
outside of the Kihansi Gorge. The long-term population viability of the Uhehehe Red Colubus in&#13;
the Udzungwa Mountains can be enhanced by developing a landscape-wide conservation&#13;
strategy for the Kihansi Gorge in the context of the Udzungwa Mountains.&#13;

17.    Surveys that have been conclucted to date of small mammals, fish, and insects have found&#13;
that species of these taxa have broadi geographic distributions outside of the of the Kihansi Gorge&#13;
and thus should not be adversely affected by alteration in patterns of discharge through the&#13;
gorge.&#13;
18.    The total area of natural forest in the Udzungwa Mountains is 2,103 km2 of which 389&#13;
km2 is closed forest. Approximately 89 percent of the original forest cover in the Udzungwa&#13;
Mountains has been lost (mostly in the last 200 years). The remaining natural forest in the&#13;
Udzungwa Mountains is highly fragmented with a median patch size of 9 km2. The montane&#13;
forest in the Kihansi Gorge is one of the smallest patches of natural forest in the Udzungwa&#13;
Mountains. Many plant and animal species in the Udzungwa Gorge face additional long-term&#13;
risks of extinction as a result of habitat isolation and area effects.&#13;
19.    There is modest agricultural settlement upstream  of the Gorge in the catchment area.&#13;
Agriculture in much of the catchment is carried out on steeply sloping hillsides, without terracing&#13;
or other soil conservation measures. Soils are unstable and prone to erosion. Agriculture, as well&#13;
as the loss of forest cover in the catchment, poses additional management challenges for the&#13;
Gorge ecosystem  because of increased sedimentation and irregular streamflow  which is an&#13;
outcome.&#13;
Kihansi Spray Toad&#13;
20.    In late 1996, the Kihansi Spray Toad (Nectophrynoides asperginis) was discovered in the&#13;
Kihansi Gorge. It was formally described as a new  species in mid-1998. Using recently&#13;
established IUCN risk criteria, the authors describing the Kihansi Spray Toad proposed that it&#13;
should be listed as critically endangered because of its highly restricted geographic distribution:&#13;
it is known only from four wetland meadow sites within the Kihansi Gorge. Though the Kihansi&#13;
Spray Toad is not currently included in IUCN's Red List of critically endangered species&#13;
(published listings are only made every four years), the entire genus, Nectophrynoides, is listed&#13;

Technical Annex&#13;
in CITES Appendix I as endangered.&#13;
21.   The breeding biology of the Kihansi Spray Toad, as well as its very localized spatial&#13;
distribution, are factors that make it particularly prone to human disturbance. The Kihansi Spray&#13;
toad is oviviparous or live-bearing and thus the fecundity of this species is low in comparison to&#13;
egg-laying species.&#13;
22.   The Kihansi Spray Toad has one of the smallest geographic ranges - approximately 2.0&#13;
ha - of any tetrapod, worldwide. In addition, all of the sub-populations are located along a 4 - 5&#13;
km stretch of the Kihansi River. This species is highly vulnerable to extinction due to a&#13;
catastrophic event such the introduction of a predator, competitor, disease or the severe alteration&#13;
of its habitat.&#13;
23.   As a result of the reduction of water flow through the gorge and isolation and area&#13;
effects, multiple habitats and plant and animal species in the Kihansi Gorge face increasing&#13;
threats. In the short term, the wetland spray meadows and the Kihansi Spray Toad are the&#13;
habitats and species that are most vulnerable. In the medium-term, the montane forest and the&#13;
three undescribed species of plant (Coffea sp., a Triurid, and a Acanthid) in addition to the&#13;
wetland spray meadows and the Kihansi Spray Toad are probably most vulnerable. In the long-&#13;
term, multiple habitats and species in the Kihansi Gorge face will face increased risk of alteration&#13;
or extinction. The nature of these threats and their likely impacts are indicated in Table 1.&#13;
Conservation Measures&#13;
24.   A series of conservation measures have been identified to address the various threats&#13;
facing the Kihansi Gorge ecosystem. These are summarized in Table 2. The measures include&#13;
captive breeding of the Kihansi Spray Toad, installing artificial spray irrigation, constructing&#13;
wetland spray meadow walkways, evaluating intermittent bypass flows, identifying the&#13;
distribution and abundance of the newly discovered plant species, identifying the distribution and&#13;
abundance of the Kihansi Spray Toad and appropriate habitat outside of the Kihansi Gorge,&#13;
translocating the Kihansi Spray Toad, and developing a landscape-wide conservation plan for the&#13;
Kihansi Gorge in the context of the       Table 3: Immediate Rescue and Emergency Measures&#13;

Project Objectives and Components&#13;
Objectives&#13;
26.   The objective of the proposed Lower Kihansi Environmental Management Project&#13;
(LKEMP) is to put in place a series of imedium-term measures to ensure the long-term&#13;
conservation of the Kihansi Gorge ecosystem and upstream catchment areas. At the national&#13;
level, the project has the objective of supporting the development of a coordinated and consistent&#13;
legal and institutional framework for environmental and water resources management and&#13;
strengthening of ecosystem monitoring and assessment functions of the environmental&#13;
institutions. The proposed project is comprised of four components:&#13;
* Habitat and species conservation and rnanagement;&#13;
* Establishment of final water right;&#13;
. Implementing an Updated Environmental Management Plan;&#13;
* Institutional Strengthening.&#13;
27.   Estimated project costs and the financing plan are summarized in Tables 4 and 5.&#13;
Component 1: Habitat and species conservalion and management&#13;
28.   The project is expected to develop and launch a Kihansi gorge ecosystem monitoring and&#13;
conservation program, to provide resources to follow-up on the captive breeding efforts (in&#13;
particular to finance translocation studies, to assess the feasibility of, and to develop a plan for&#13;
the reintroduction of the Kihansi Spray Toad to another habitat in Tanzania, if this is judged to&#13;
be the most appropriate approach for the conservation of the species. Among other things, the&#13;
monitoring and conservation program would identify threats to other endemic or threatened&#13;
species in the Gorge ecosystem, and would develop and implement necessary mitigation&#13;
measures. These could include altering the bypass flow regime, translocation and reintroduction,&#13;
or ex-situ propagation.&#13;
29.   Ecosystem monitoring and conservation program. The objective of the ecosystem&#13;
monitoring and conservation program will be to develop and implement monitoring protocols for&#13;
the Gorge ecosystem (relying on the best technical inputs available), to evaluate the impacts of&#13;
earlier mitigation interventions in the Gorge (such as the spray irrigation system), to recommend&#13;
changes or improvements to these, to examine new mitigation proposals (such as the proposed&#13;
'ski jump' option), and to support a comprehensive program of ecological research of relevance&#13;
to conservation of the Gorge ecosystem.&#13;
30.   The development of monitoring protocols is an early priority. Past efforts at mitigation&#13;
have been hampered, for example, because of methodological inconsistencies in monitoring&#13;
populations of threatened species. Much early work focused principally on systematics, and on&#13;
species identification, rather than on population dynamics, and how species distribution might&#13;
change with changes in the ecosystem. Baseline studies have, to some extent, been biased toward&#13;
understanding the distribution of forest tree species, rather than the distribution of plant species&#13;
more generally or wider ecosystem studies.&#13;

31.    The project will provide support for annual consultations amongst project personnel,&#13;
researchers, and key stakeholders, for the purposes of defining the scope and boundaries of&#13;
needed research and required studies and to establish monitoring protocols as well as to provide&#13;
a forum for presenting preliminary and final results. It is important that information and findings&#13;
are freely and regularly exchanged among institutions, scientists, and project personnel involved&#13;
in research, monitoring, and assessment in the Kihansi Gorge as well as between institutions and&#13;
individuals involved in situ and ex situ conservation activities of the Kihansi Spray Toad.&#13;
32.    Monitoring studies should focus, for example, on the impact of short- and medium-term&#13;
conservation measures which are underway, and research is required to fill critical gaps in&#13;
knowledge. Particular attention will be given to developing monitoring protocols that have&#13;
sufficient statistical power to detect long-term  trends in populations, communities, and&#13;
landscapes. Of special importance are detailed ecological studies of the Kihansi Spray Toad and&#13;
its habitat requirements, the distribution, abundance and ecology of the newly discovered plant&#13;
species, effects of intermittent bypass flows on the Kihansi Spray Toad and wetland meadows&#13;
and montane forest, and the social and economic costs of establishing wildlife corridors and&#13;
expanding protected area coverage in the Udzungwa Mountains.&#13;
33.    The project will establish  a mechanism  to provide resources, through  an .ipen,&#13;
competitive, and peer-reviewed process, to national and interational scientists to conduct short-&#13;
and medium-term studies for the purposes of filling critical gaps in knowledge. Furthermore,&#13;
Tanzanian students and interns from relevant institutions will be supported under the institutional&#13;
strengthening component of this project to conduct field research on important aspects of the&#13;
ecology of the Kihansi Gorge.&#13;
34.    The project will provide resources to establish a permanent environmental monitoring&#13;
station in the Gorge, with support facilities in Kihansi but outside of the Gorge. The permanent&#13;

Technical Annex&#13;
environmental monitoring station will be constructed at the existing research camp site, and will&#13;
be designed on the basis of specifications to be determined as a result of the first consultations&#13;
among stakeholders and researchers and on monitoring requirements and protocols. The&#13;
environmental monitoring station will be constlucted and operated in a manner which has a low-&#13;
impact on the immediate ecosystem, will be dlesigned to operate year-round, and will house a&#13;
field laboratory and accommodations for researchers, and visitors from coordinating&#13;
environmental institutions including members of the MTAC and the Steering Committee.&#13;
3 5.   Species conservation and captive breeding. A captive breeding program for the Kihansi&#13;
Spray Toad was launched in November 2000 by the US-based Wildlife Conservation Society&#13;
(WCS) and the National Amphibian Conservation Center (NACC). Around 500 individuals were&#13;
taken from Kihansi for the purpose of captive breeding. The success of the captive breeding&#13;
program ultimately depends on the successful reintroduction of the species to Tanzania either to&#13;
the original, restored, habitat in the Gorge, or to another similar habitat in Tanzania.&#13;
36.   The project may provide resources to retain specialist services needed to maintain the&#13;
captive breeding program until the species can be returned to Tanzania. These services will be&#13;
identified during project implementation, in cooperation with the lead captive breeding&#13;
institutions. In addition, the project will provide resources to enable the Wildlife Department,&#13;
others from NEMC, the MTAC, or the MAultisectoral Steering Committee to undertake&#13;
monitoring visits to the captive breeding facilities once a year.&#13;
37.   Field work and related studies to examine the potential for reintroducing the toad to&#13;
another site in Tanzania was launched as part of the IREMS project. It is unlikely that these&#13;
studies will be brought to closure in the short term, and there is clearly a need to continue to&#13;
search for alternative reintroduction sites. The project will finance translocation studies with the&#13;
objective of developing and implementing a plan for reintroduction of the species. The decision&#13;
to translocate the species will be made as an outcome of consultations with specialists and&#13;
researchers. The project will finance oversight monitoring activities by NEMC.&#13;
38.   Landscape-wide conservation plan. The Kihansi Gorge comprises a small fraction of&#13;
the much larger Udzungwa mountain ecosystem, on which it is highly dependent. The&#13;
Udzungwa Scarp Forest Reserve, for example, accounts for around one-third of the entire water&#13;
catchment for the Kihansi hydropower project. Preliminary studies have been undertaken with&#13;
regard to the need to ensure that forest fragments remain connected by corridors to reduce the&#13;
threat of local extinction. The IREMS project has launched the preparation of the Kihansi Area&#13;
Conservation Plan (which focuses largely on the immediate Gorge and the vicinity). This plan&#13;
will be reviewed by LKEMP and funds will be mobilized from other sources to support its&#13;
implementation.&#13;
39.   The LKEMP proposes to extend the Kihansi Area Conservation Planning process to the&#13;
wider landscape and the upstream catchment area, to incorporate some of the issues with regard&#13;
to Kihansi into conservation of the Udzungwa Mountains ecosystem and the farming systems as&#13;
a whole. This activity will be coordinated with the proposed GEF Eastern Arc Conservation and&#13;
Management Project and the DANIDA supported Udzungwa Mountains Forest Management and&#13;
Biodiversity Conservation Project, and funds will be mobilized from other sources to support its&#13;
implementation.&#13;

40.   Capacity building. The project will support teaching in Conservation Biology at the&#13;
University of Dar es Salaam to increase the institutional capacity of Tanzania to conserve and&#13;
manage threatened habitats and species and to train future researchers, natural resource&#13;
managers, and decision makers in conservation biology. Additional support will be provided for&#13;
the overseas training of 2 doctoral students in conservation biology with a focus on problems of&#13;
conserving and managing threatened habitats and species in Tanzania. Support shall also be&#13;
provided for the overseas training of 2 Masters degree students who shall conduct their field&#13;
research on aspects of the ecology of the Kihansi Gorge, and through in-service, short course,&#13;
training of technical staff, as required.  The project will also finance training needs for&#13;
monitoring staff in the Vice President's Office, including (as appropriate) study tours and&#13;
exchange visits.&#13;
Component 2: Establishment offinal water right&#13;
41.   The project will continue to implement the work plan for the modified flow regimes&#13;
prepared under the Immediate Rescue and Emergency Measures (IREMS) Project which is&#13;
intended to finance a transparent process for establishing a final water right for Tanesco to&#13;
operate the Kihansi facility on the basis of scientific inputs and representations from the Ministry&#13;
of Water and Livestock Development, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism, the&#13;
National Environment Management Council, the Environment Division (Vice President's&#13;
Office), Tanesco, stakeholders in the scientific community and NGOs. The project will finance&#13;
the operations of the Multidisciplinary Technical Advisory Committee (MTAC) to carry out&#13;
several tasks.&#13;
42.   Interim bypass flow monitoring. An interim monitoring program will be instituted to&#13;
ensure that the provisional maximum bypass flows (of between 1.51 - 1.89 m3/s, or a continuous&#13;
average flow of 1.7 m3/s) from the bypass pipe is maintained until the final water right is granted.&#13;
An interim monitoring program will be prepared with support from the project, and sanctions&#13;
against non compliance will be outlined. Implementation of the interim bypass flow monitoring&#13;
will be the responsibility of the RBWO and NEMC and it should include: (a) continuous flow&#13;
measuring devices at the RBWO flow gauging station, (b) regular reporting of the continuous&#13;
environmental flow releases, and (c) frequent field monitoring by RBWO. To the extent possible,&#13;
interim monitoring will rely on existing data collection which is undertaken by Tanesco as part&#13;
of its power station management regime.&#13;
43.   Flow manipulation and ecological studies. To test the efficacy of measures for partially&#13;
restoring the degraded Kihansi Gorge ecosystem, a series of intermittent high flow studies&#13;
coupled with ecological studies will be carried out to determine a modified environmental flow&#13;
regime. The objective of the intermittent high flow studies will be to examine the dispersion and&#13;
amount of spray and microclimate changes (temperature and humidity) against different flow&#13;
regimes in the Kihansi Gorge. The ecological studies will focus on survivorship and natality of&#13;
the Kihansi Spray Toad, and effects on predators, food items and the wetland plant community.&#13;
Experimental ex situ studies will be included as part of this research to examine the impact of&#13;
intermittent high flows on aspects of the ecology of the toad and its habitat.&#13;

Technical Anne,x&#13;
44.   Intermittent high flow studies. A combination of intermittent high flow releases together&#13;
with low background flows (i.e., full bypass releases) will be tested to develop partially&#13;
acceptable conditions in the gorge. The efficacy of the strategy for influencing statistically&#13;
significant changes in the amount and dispersicn of the spray and temperature and humidity will&#13;
be tested over a 24 month period.3 A controlled flow regime will need to be operated for a&#13;
continuous period of at least several days if any indications of long term effect is to be expected.&#13;
Flow manipulation studies should be carried out during both the dry season and the wet season&#13;
and should include several variations for the intermittent high flow sequences with constant low&#13;
background flows.&#13;
45.   Ecological studies. The ecological implications of the flow manipulation studies (on&#13;
survivorship and natality of the Kihansi Spray Toad, and effects on predators, food items and the&#13;
wetland plant community) will also be carefully investigated.&#13;
46.   Proposed flow manipulation and ecological studies are summarized in Table 6.&#13;
47.   Financial and economic evaluation. Based on the findings of various studies, an&#13;
economic and financial impact of power losses due to a range of modified environmental flow&#13;
regime will be carried out.&#13;
48.   Prepare recommendations on a modlified environmental flow regime. Based on an&#13;
evaluation of the studies carried out, the MTAC will recommend to the NEMC as an input into&#13;
decision making by the Rufiji Basin Water Board on the modified environmental flow regime to&#13;
be stipulated as a condition of the final water right. This recommendation should:&#13;
*  focus on the conditions for a water right for Phase 1 (180 MW) operations4&#13;
&#149; be based on balancing the conservation value of partial restoration of the Kihansi Gorge and&#13;
the financial and economic impact of a imodified environmental flow regime, within the&#13;
prevailing policy environment towards water resources management.&#13;
* include the operating conditions and criteria for a final water right. The operating conditions&#13;
for a final water right will include flow combinations to be released through existing bypass&#13;
pipe and other outlet works of the dam (i.e., gates, etc.) during both the dry season and wet&#13;
season with  provisions to  provide the flexibility  for modifications, should  future&#13;
circumstances warrant. Release water quality conditions will also be stipulated.&#13;
3   The 24 month period would include the intermittent flow studies to be carried out under the short- and medium-tern&#13;
measures.&#13;
4   The maximum water flows for operating the three Phase 1 60 MW turbines is 24.9 m3/s.&#13;

Flow Manipulation Studies&#13;
Flow manipulation studies should be carried out during the dry season as well as during the wet season and&#13;
should include several variations for the intermittent high flow sequences with constant low background&#13;
flows. Studies would have the objective of determining dispersion and temperature effects of different flow&#13;
regimes. For example,&#13;
*  Low background flows (1.7 m3/s for 18 hours) plus 4 m3/s for 2 hours, followed by 6 m3/s for 2&#13;
hours, and 8 m3/s for 2 hours;&#13;
.  Low background flows (1.7 m3/s for 20 hours) plus 8 m3/s for 4 hours,&#13;
&#149;  Low background flows (1.7 m3/s for 20 hours) plus 10 m31s for 2 hours followed by 8 m3/s for 2&#13;
hours;&#13;
.  Low background flows (1.7 m3/s for 12 hours) plus 3 m3/s for 6 hours, followed by 4 m3/s for 4 hours&#13;
and 6 m3/s for 2 hours; and,&#13;
.  Constant background flow of 3.0 and 3.5 m3/s for 24 hours.&#13;
The water quality implications (silt and sediment loads) of the intermittent high flow sequences would also be&#13;
analyzed.&#13;

*  change in microclimate;&#13;
*  dispersion and amount of spray;&#13;
.  response of food items;&#13;
I   response of predators;&#13;
.  change in plant community; and,&#13;
*  survivorship of toads.&#13;
Longer term studies to examine in greater detail the ecology of the toad and the newly described plant species.&#13;
etc., will continue beyond the 24 month period.&#13;
49.    Monitoring and enforcement of the final water right. An effective system  that is&#13;
robust and practical for monitoring and enforcement of the final water right will be put in place&#13;
to ensure compliance with the provisions of the final water right, and in support of the existing&#13;
Water Utilization and Control Act (1974, Cap. 42). These measures will be integrated into the&#13;
implementation program for the updated Environmental Management Plan. A monitoring and&#13;
enforcement program for regular monitoring, and sanctions against non-compliance will be&#13;
prepared. This program will be implemented by the RBWO and NEMC.&#13;
50.    Support data collection for hydrological model calibration. The project will support&#13;
collection of additional hydrological data5 and database development for calibrating the&#13;
hydrological model that TANESCO is developing. The hydrological model will be used for&#13;
supporting the operations of the power facility to optimize the dual objectives of hydropower&#13;
generation and Kihansi Gorge Ecosystem management.&#13;
"he data to be collected include climate, rainfall, stream flow, water quality and sediment load. The station locations and&#13;
data collection frequency will be determined by TANESCO and RBWO.&#13;

Technical Annex&#13;
Component 3: Implementing an Updated Environmental Management Plan.&#13;
51.   In light of the discovery of threatened endemic species in the Kihansi Gorge ecosystem,&#13;
there is a need immediately to prepare supplemental Environmental Assessment work, and to&#13;
develop an Environmental Management Plan, which must be implemented as a condition of the&#13;
final water right which is to be granted to Tanesco to operate the facility and to account for any&#13;
proposed future changes in power infrastructure at the site. In conjunction with the first project&#13;
component, the project will finance the design, organization, staffing, and funding, for an&#13;
environmental monitoring center/station based at Kihansi which can independently meet the&#13;
challenges of monitoring and implementation of an updated Environmental Management Plan,&#13;
and which involves local government in implementation. The project will finance establishment&#13;
and operation of this center/station until long-term financing arrangements can be agreed with&#13;
Tanesco. The project will support NEMC to prepare ecosystem monitoring guidelines for the&#13;
districts in the Kihansi catchment area. A feasibility study will be carried out to assess the most&#13;
cost-effective means for ex-situ species conservation and the conditions under which this&#13;
approach should be taken, including establishment of a captive breeding facility in conjunction&#13;
with the environmental monitoring center/station.&#13;
52.   Preparation  of the EMP  update. Preparation of the updated  Environmental&#13;
Management Plan should commence immediately, based on the extensive information already&#13;
available. The EMW should consider the results from the environmental studies already carried&#13;
out in Kihansi, and should include enough flexibility to incorporate new lessons as they become&#13;
available, particularly from the Ecosystem monitoring and conservation program as well as&#13;
from work carried out to establish the final water right.&#13;
53.   The updated Environmental Managernent Plan will specify the conditions which bind&#13;
Tanesco to operate the hydroelectric facility as a condition of the final water right, and will&#13;
describe independent monitoring arrangements to ensure that Tanesco remains in compliance&#13;
with these conditions. The EMP will also describe further mitigation measures which should be&#13;
tested or otherwise implemented.&#13;
54.   The EMP should also give consideration to proposed changes in the infrastructure at the&#13;
Kihansi site, in particular, the proposal that the currently operating 3 turbines are augmented with&#13;
an additional 2 turbines, and the impact this is likely to have on the Gorge ecosystem. It should&#13;
specify the likely impacts of these changes on the water flow, and the mitigating measures which&#13;
would have to be taken to ensure that the Gorge ecosystem is conserved.6&#13;
55.   The updated EMN  should consider, in the first instance, only those factors which&#13;
influence the conservation of the Gorge ecosystem and catchment, and the threatened species&#13;
found there, rather than the broader set of conditions and operating criteria addressed during&#13;
implementation of Power VI (in particular the public health aspects of the project, which, of&#13;
course, remain unaffected by the discovery of new species in the Gorge). Particular issues such&#13;
as fire management should be addressed in the EMP. The updated EMP should be completed&#13;
within the first two years after the project becomes effective.&#13;
6  The question is probably of lower priority. The recently completed Power Sector Master Plan (Acres Intemational,&#13;
November 2000) concluded that 'investments in additional units (at Kihansi are) ... unlikely to be cost-effective.'&#13;

Technical Annex&#13;
56.   Implementing the Updated EMP. Implementation of the updated EMP will be carried&#13;
out in conjunction with the ecosystem monitoring and conservation program. Because of the&#13;
uncertainties surrounding the mitigation steps which will be identified and developed in the&#13;
EMP, the planning of the likely investments which will be needed is constrained. Funding for&#13;
possible mitigation measures is included in the proposed project budget in the project's fourth&#13;
and fifth years, and will be reallocated if needed.&#13;
57.   A central feature of the implementation period, however, will be the development of a&#13;
system for monitoring water flows through the Gorge. During preparation of the EMP, the scope&#13;
for tapping into the existing Tanesco monitoring system will be explored, with a view to&#13;
developing 'live' reporting of bypass and spill flows, and power station offlake. The institutional&#13;
responsibility for monitoring bypass flows will be identified during preparation of the EMP.&#13;
58.   The Multisectoral Technical Advisory Committee and the project Steering Committee&#13;
will be responsible for directing the implementation of the Environmental Management Plan.&#13;
Support shall be provided for training of the supervisory and field staff responsible for&#13;
implementing EMP.&#13;
Component 4: Institutional Strengthening.&#13;
59.   The national system for environmental and water resources management needs to be&#13;
rationalized. Consistent with the recommendations of the Environmental Review, the project will&#13;
finance preparation and implementation of a program of institutional capacity building which&#13;
results in a coordinated system, at the national level, of environmental and water resources&#13;
management. The program will take into account and will adopt and support the implementation&#13;
of the recommendations and findings of the recently completed review carried out by the&#13;
Institutional and Legal Framework for Environmental Management Project (ILFEMP) as well as&#13;
recommendations related to the establishment of a new national water policy.7 The strategy will&#13;
include several linked elements: institute legal mandates for environmental management,&#13;
establish the capacity for regulation and enforcement, provide training and fund an awareness&#13;
building program.&#13;
60.   Regulatory Framework for Environmental Management The project will finance&#13;
support for finalization and dissemination of proposed national environmental impact assessment&#13;
guidelines, as recommended in the Environmental Review and in the ILFEMP study, and will&#13;
finance a series of public consultations to capture stakeholder concerns and perspectives on how&#13;
these guidelines should be promulgated. Once a consensus has been reached about proposed&#13;
guidelines, which is consistent with the national policy framework, the project will also finance&#13;
dissemination.&#13;
61.   Awareness raising. An awareness raising  program  about the importance  of&#13;
environmentally sustainable water resources management will be developed and implemented by&#13;
NEMC in conjunction with the Ministry of Water and Livestock Development to support the&#13;
7  This should complement the work that IUCN is initiating in the Rufiji Basin and proposing to support in the Pangani and&#13;
Ruvuma Basins.&#13;

implementation of the environmental management aspects of the new water policy. The overall&#13;
objective will be to support the implementation of the key environmental management provisions&#13;
related to the sustainable management of water resources, including its quantity, quality, aquatic&#13;
ecosystems, protection of important watersheds and groundwater recharge areas, control of&#13;
invasive species (such as water hyacinth) and protection of biodiversity. The program will&#13;
develop specific messages for targeting for particular groups (including cabinet ministers,&#13;
Permanent Secretaries and Directors, multi-sectoral water user groups, and the public) and to be&#13;
communicated through various media (newsletters and newspaper, workshop, radio, TV, etc.).&#13;
The awareness program will have components at the national, sector and area specific levels. It&#13;
will be developed by a Local Media Consulting Company, in consultations with NEMC and the&#13;
MOWL over a period of 3 months and im;plemented jointly by NEMC and MOWL.&#13;
62.   Capacity Building and Training. The IREMS project is undertaking an institutional&#13;
capacity needs assessment to identify gaps, weaknesses and strengths in capacities for&#13;
environmental decision making, specific to the question of water resources and the environment.&#13;
Much of this work must be put into the wider context posed by ILFEMP, which proposed&#13;
various strategies and institutional mechanisms for addressing questions of environmental&#13;
management and regulation, especially in the context of decentralization.&#13;
63.   Based on the results of the capacity needs assessment, a program for strengthening the&#13;
local capacity for implementing ETA legislation and for monitoring, regulating and enforcing the&#13;
legal provisions related to environmental quality objectives in the water policy in water sector&#13;
projects (for example, for hydropower generation, irrigation development, domestic, industrial&#13;
and mining water supply, etc.) will be implemented. This will follow the recommendations of the&#13;
ILFEMP study and complement the capacity building recommendations under the River Basin&#13;
Management and Smallholder Irrigation Improvement Project which will calls for the&#13;
establishment of environmental units in the MOWL and RBWOs (in the Pangani and Rufiji&#13;
Basins). The capacity building program will be finalized on the basis of the findings of the&#13;
capacity needs assessment, and may include:&#13;
* Support for developing a program in environmental management/sciences at the University&#13;
of Dar es Salaam for training undergraduate and post-graduate students in areas of&#13;
environmental management, planning, freshwater ecology, environmental engineering;&#13;
*  Strengthening the monitoring and assessment and EIA Departments/units within NEMC and&#13;
DOE;&#13;
* Supporting the establishment of environmental units within the Ministry of Energy and&#13;
Minerals, including support for incorporating environmental concerns into hydropower&#13;
planning;&#13;
*  Short courses (2-4 week) in Environmental Compliance;&#13;
* Strengthening the water monitoring and enforcement capacity of the RBWO, with a specific&#13;
emphasis on hydrology;&#13;
* Participation of a range of stakehclders in targeted workshop/training/conferences (e.g.,&#13;
Environmental Flow Assessment for Rivers: An international working conference on&#13;
methods and case histories on March 3-8, 2002 in Cape Town).&#13;

SECTION B: PROJECTA DMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Institutional Arrangements&#13;
64.   Policy guidance and overall project oversfte and supervision is to be provided by a high-&#13;
level Steering Committee which has been constituted specifically to deal with matters related to&#13;
the Lower Kihansi Gorge. The Steering Committee is comprised of the Permanent Secretaries&#13;
from the Vice President's Office (Chairman), the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism, the&#13;
Ministry of Energy and Minerals, the Ministry of Water and Livestock Development, and the&#13;
Ministry of Finance.&#13;
65.   The Multisectoral Technical Advisory Committee (MTAC) has been constituted to&#13;
provide advice to the Steering Committee on matters related to Kihansi. It is comprised largely&#13;
of representatives of key stakeholders, including the Division of Environment (Vice President's&#13;
Office), National Environment Management Council, Tanesco, the Ministry of Water and&#13;
Livestock Development, the Ministry of Energy and Minerals, the Division of Wildlife (MN1RT),&#13;
and the Forestry and Beekeeping Division (MNRT). Members of the MTAC will also have key&#13;
project implementation responsibilities, and the project will provide support for efficient&#13;
communication.&#13;
66    The National Environment Management Council will be the lead coordinating institution&#13;
for project implementation. A Project Coordinator will be employed by the project, and housed&#13;
by NEMC, within 3 months of the date of effectiveness of the project.&#13;
67.   Under the coordinating mechanism to be established by NEMC, there will be multiple&#13;
implementing institutions. Implementation responsibilities for these institutions and the flow of&#13;
communication in the coordinating rnechanism are indicated in Table 7 and in Figure I&#13;
respectively.&#13;

68.   The Project Coordinator will be assisted by a consultant to provide guidance specifically&#13;
with respect to conservation biology. The consultant should hold a Masters or Ph.D. in ecology&#13;
with a minimum of 10 years of experience with expertise in population and conservation&#13;
biology. This individual will also be responsible for providing assistance in updating and&#13;
implementing the Environmental Management Plan and will be recruited in consultation with the&#13;
MTAC,&#13;
Procurement, Disbursement, and Financial Management&#13;
69.   In order to facilitate project start-up, existing financial management and procurement&#13;
capacity in the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism is to be mobilized to provide this&#13;
support as an interim measure. The finarncial management and procurement capacity of existing&#13;
consultant staff within MNRT was assessed during preparation to determine strengths and&#13;
weaknesses, and to establish if this exis,ting capacity would be adequate in the short term for&#13;
assisting in project implementation. This assessment concluded that existing capacity is adequate&#13;
for meeting the procurement and financial management demands of the project, though there is&#13;
scope for strengthening.&#13;
Procurement Arrangements&#13;
70    Procurement financed under the project will be limited to recruitment of consultants&#13;
services, office equipment, a limited number of vehicles, some civil works, and incremental&#13;
operating costs. An experienced Procurement Specialist (already in place) will have&#13;

responsibility for ensuring that procurement for works and goods is carried out in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (dated January&#13;
1995 and revised in January and August 1996, in September 1997, and January 1999).&#13;
Consultancy services financed by IDA will be procured in accordance with the Bank Guidelines&#13;
for the Selection and Employment of Conisultants by World Bank Borrowers (dated January 1997,&#13;
and revised September 1997 and January 1999).&#13;
71.   A General Procurement Notice will be published in United Nations Development&#13;
Business (UNDB) and will include a description of required services or goods, the client agency,&#13;
and the budgeted cost. This notice will be updated every year during the execution of the projects&#13;
until all contracts and assignments have been procured. In the case of contracts which are&#13;
expected to cost more than $200,000 equivalent, Specific Procurement Notices will be issued&#13;
through the national press or other means.&#13;
72.   To the extent possible, procurement arrangements have been designed to respond to the&#13;
need for flexible use of procurement methods, given the institutional capacity of the&#13;
implementing agencies and the need for urgent action. A detailed Procurement Plan describing&#13;
procurement requirements for the project's first year is in preparation, and will be completed&#13;
before effectiveness. This will be revised annually during preparation of the Annual Work&#13;
Program and Budget. Whenever possible, procurement items will be consoiidated into&#13;
appropriately-scaled contracting packages.&#13;
73.   Procurement of goods, works, and services will be carried out by the National&#13;
Environment Management Council working in the first instance with MNRT.&#13;
74.   A Procurement Evaluation Committee (PEC) will be constituted by the Multisectoral&#13;
Technical Advisory Committee to support the implementation of the Lower Kihansi&#13;
Environmental Management Project. Its primary function will be to evaluate tender documents&#13;

75.   The presence of a quorum of PEC members will be required for all bid evaluations.&#13;
Contracts for the procurement of goods (e g. vehicles, computers and other office equipment not&#13;
available locally) would be packaged into larger contracts wherever possible.&#13;
Civil works&#13;
76.   Civil works to be carried out under this project are expected to consist of small contracts&#13;
mostly under US$ 100,000 and therefore no procurement under International Competitive&#13;
Bidding procedures is envisaged. Individual contracts for civil works under US$ 50,000, up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$ 200,000 will be procured on the basis of three quotations from&#13;
qualified contractors. The first three of these contracts will be subject to prior review. Contracts&#13;
estimated to cost $50,000 (in aggregate not to exceed $250,000) and above will be procured on&#13;
the basis of National Competitive Bidding, all of which will be subject to prior review.&#13;
Goods and Equipment&#13;
77.   Individual contracts for goods and equipment with an estimated value of less than&#13;
$30,000 will be procured using local or international shopping, for an aggregate not to exceed&#13;
$400,000, based on comparing price quotations from at least three suppliers in response to&#13;
written invitation. Individual contracts for goods and equipment more than US$ 30,000 per&#13;
contract and less than $150,000 per contract will be procured through National Competitive&#13;
Bidding procedures for an aggregate not to exceed $200,000. The first three of these contracts&#13;
will be subject to prior review. For contracts estimated to cost $150,000 and above, International&#13;
Competitive Bidding will be used.&#13;
78.   Individual units of office equiprment (individual fax machines, printers, and laptop&#13;
computers) may be purchased through the Inter-Agency Procurement Services Office (IAPSO)&#13;
of the United Nations with an aggregate value not to exceed $200,000.&#13;

of all TORs, proposed budgets, contracts, and consultant qualifications. Sole sourcing may be&#13;
allowed on an exceptional basis and prior agreement with IDA, subject to the conditions outlined&#13;
in the Guidelines. Prior review will also be required of all single-source consultancies, regardless&#13;
of their value. Contracts for. individual consultants below US$ 50,000, and for consulting firms&#13;
below US $100,000, will be subject to post-review. Prior review will be required for individual&#13;
contracts above US$50,000 and above US$100,000 for firms.&#13;
81.   With regard to workshops, training, study tours and field expenses, prior review of all&#13;
activities will be required, including proposed budget, agenda, participants, location of training,&#13;
and other relevant details.&#13;
Incremental operating costs&#13;
82.   Incremental operating costs are defined to mean building, equipment, and vehicle&#13;
maintenance  costs,  fuel,  office  supplies,  building  rental  charges,  utilities,  and&#13;
telecommunications costs, and the costs of Project support staff, but excluding salaries of&#13;
officials of the civil service.&#13;
83.   For most activities, however, prior review will be limited to contracts above the&#13;
thresholds stated above. IDA may request prior review of bid documents, evaluation methods&#13;
and contracts for which they require more detailed information. Similarly, any request for no&#13;
objection from Secretariat will be formally replied by IDA.&#13;
Post review&#13;
84.   Under the project, the procurement actions not subject to prior review as described above&#13;
will be subject to post-review. This is to allow for fast disbursement of funds while assuring&#13;
transparency and consistency with these procedures. All documentation used for the procedures&#13;
of contracting , recruitment of consulting services, evaluation and award shall be retained for&#13;
subsequent examination by independent auditors and IDA supervision missions. The number,&#13;
timing and pattern of supervision missions will be determined at the start of the implementation&#13;
program.&#13;
Disbursement Arrangements&#13;
85.   All disbursements will be handled in a manner which is consistent with the World Bank's&#13;
Disbursement Handbook, and as described in the Development Credit Agreement. Funds will be&#13;
disbursed over 5 year period, planned to begin in July 2001. The Completion Date will be June&#13;
30, 2006 and the Closing Date will be December 31, 2006. All applications to withdraw proceeds&#13;
from the Credit will be fully documented, except for expenditures for incremental operating&#13;
costs, training costs, and contracts with a value of $150,000 or less for goods and equipment,&#13;
$50,000 or less for civil works, $100,000 or less for consultants services (firms), $50,000 or less&#13;
for consultants services (individuals), for which reimbursements or replenishments to the Special&#13;
Account may be made against Statements of Expenditure (SOEs). Supporting documentation&#13;
will be retained by the Government and will be available for inspection and review as requested&#13;
by IDA Supervision Missions and by project auditors.&#13;

87.    Consistent with the framework  for streamlined  implementation, four disbursement&#13;
categories are envisaged: civil works, goods and equipment, consulting services and training, and&#13;
incremental operating costs.&#13;
Financial Management&#13;
88.    In order to facilitate project start-up, existing financial management capacity in the&#13;
Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism is to be mobilized to provide this support as an&#13;
interim measure. An assessment of the financial management capacity in place in MNRT&#13;
indicated that it would be adequate to support implementation of LKEMP as an interim measure&#13;
until permanent implementation capacity is established. MNRT staff are qualified and have long&#13;
experience in implementing IDA projects. In the medium-term, additional capacity will be&#13;

Key Performance Indicators&#13;
The Lower Kihansi Environmental Management Project is expected to result in the:&#13;
1.     Development and implementation of a Kihansi Gorge ecosystem monitoring program which, among&#13;
other things, develops technical standards for monitoring flora and fauna populations in the Gorge,&#13;
evaluates the effectiveness of various mitigation measures already under implementation, and which&#13;
recommends new mifigation measures as needed.&#13;
2.     Development and implementation of measures to improve the conservation status of the Kihansi&#13;
Gorge ecosy stem. and to restore critical habitats where this is possible and cost-effective.&#13;
3.     Establishment of the criteria and the mechanisms for reintroducing threatened endemic species to the&#13;
Kihansi Gorge (such as the Kihansi Spray Toad). or to other appropriate habitats.&#13;
4      Preparation of a landscape-wide conservation and catchment area management plan which considers&#13;
upstream catchment protection and its impact on the Kihansi Gorge.&#13;
5.     Strengthening of the capacitv and the institutional basis for conserving threatened habitats and species&#13;
in Tanzania. and for training future researchers, natural resource managers. and decision makers in&#13;

            Tanzania - Lower Kihansi Environmental
            Management Technical Assistance Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Lower Kihansi Environmental
            Management Technical Assistance Project aims at ensuring
            long-term conservation of the Kihansi Gorge ecosystem and
            upstream catchment areas. The project will, at the national
            level, support the development of a coordinated and
            consistent legal and institutional framework for
            environmental and water resources management. The project
            comprises of four components, namely: habitat and species
            conservation and management; establishment of final water
            rights; implementation of an updated environmental
            management plan; and institutional strengthening. While the
            project will improve the Government's capacity to
            manage a threatened ecosystem, major risks are associated
            with increased power demands in Tanzania, which may limit
            the Tanzania Electric Supply Company's ability to
            provide sufficient bypass water flows necessary to conserve
            the Gorge ecosystem, as well as long-term risks associated
            with drought management.
