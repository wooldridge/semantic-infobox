Given the fact that nearly half of all Africans&#13;
living in rural areas obtain their drinking&#13;
water from handpumps (RWSN 2007),&#13;
finding a mechanism for keeping widely&#13;
dispersed handpumps functioning over&#13;
time is critical to meeting the MDG targets&#13;

The FRUGAL Concept&#13;
&#13;
FRUGAL represents a potential response&#13;
to problems associated with the `project&#13;
approach' to rural water supply coverage,&#13;
in which periods of massive investment                         Water operator using a motorcycle cart&#13;
are followed by periods of little or no&#13;
investment. At the same time, the FRUGAL&#13;
model is conceived to improve coverage                             within the service zone, as a way of         A local operator with an entrepreneurial&#13;
and sustainability by improving cost                               creating scale in the rural context;         orientation might also be expected to better&#13;
recovery, as well as addressing problems                                                                        respond to consumers' needs and desires,&#13;

several case studies of domestic private&#13;
sector participation in rural water supply&#13;
are on-going in six countries: Burkina Faso,&#13;

be reported by February 200. Along with&#13;
these case studies a series of workshops&#13;

            In cities and towns, private firms and
            individuals receive contracts to build, operate, and
            maintain municipal water supplies as an alternative to
            day-to-day management by local government or user
            organizations. A literature review has uncovered a wide
            variety of approaches from around the world for establishing
            such Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) in rural areas as
            well. Within the past seven years, several authors have
            completed reviews on private operators managing rural water
            supplies and other public services. In Aguateros, Paraguay,
            a consensus was found among these reviews that: markets
            exist for high quality services in rural areas; policy
            changes in support of private operator models can follow
            from successful pilot projects, if at the outset there
            exists a legal basis for contracting a private operator to
            supply water services; contracts using local government and
            communities to monitor private operator compliance are a
            more practical approach to regulation than utilizing a
            dedicated regulatory body; and financing and subsidies will
            almost surely be necessary for capital investment in the
            short to medium-term. These early lessons learned have led
            the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) to conceptualize a
            more comprehensive approach to PPP in the rural context. The
            concept is surprisingly simple. A private firm or individual
            would receive a long-term government-let contract to design,
            build or rehabilitate, operate and/or maintain water
            supplies within a defined geographical area. This aggregated
            service area would include both small towns and remote villages.
