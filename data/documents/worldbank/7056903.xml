Water and Sanitation Program-South Asia has been assisting the Government of Pakistan in its devolution&#13;
process with technical support. This has included, for example, support in developing the Local Government&#13;
Ordinance 2001, associated manuals and supporting pilot Tehsil Municipal Administrations (TMAs)&#13;
in implementing aspects of the Ordinance.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The pilot project in TMA Dera Ismail Khan focused on developing&#13;
strategies to improve water and sanitation delivery within the context of&#13;
Local Government Ordinance 2001. The pilot has drawn lessons of good&#13;
practice from recent experience of working with local governments.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Strategic options were then defined&#13;
which, together with guiding principles,&#13;
formed the basis of technical, financial,&#13;
and institutional recommendations.&#13;
&#13;
While it was envisaged that the plan&#13;
would be translated into an annual&#13;
and medium-term budget, this was&#13;
not achieved. Anticipated innovations&#13;
(extended services to rural areas,&#13;
improvement in service delivery,&#13;
consolidation of providers, and&#13;
introduction of new institutional models)&#13;
have not yet been achieved. The key&#13;
reasons for this relate to the broader&#13;
binding constraints.&#13;

&#13;
     Box 1: Local Government Ordinance 2001: Creating new models&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Local Government Ordinance (LGO) 2001 presented a new model of local government in Pakistan. It brought about&#13;
     major structural changes in service delivery including municipal services--water and sanitation services devolved to&#13;
     Tehsil Municipal Administrations that have fiscal authority, administrative control, and political oversight.&#13;
&#13;
     The creation of tehsils in rural and urban areas was anticipated to benefit the poor in several respects. Financial gains&#13;
     were envisaged from realizing economies of scale; efficiency was to be improved through embedding capacity and&#13;
     decisionmaking powers in these new local institutions, and equity enhanced across rural and urban areas.&#13;
     (Decentralization--Creating Space for W&amp;S Sector Reforms, page 2.)&#13;
&#13;
     LGO 2001 has been aimed at four major outcomes: "rationalization of agencies, participation, institutional and&#13;
     organizational robustness, and management of water as an economic good." (ibid, page 12.)&#13;
&#13;
     In order to achieve these envisaged gains and outcomes, a number of structures and system relationships were enabled&#13;
     relating to structures for participation, decentralizing certain functions to the tehsil level, planning, budgeting and financial&#13;
     flows, institutional options for service delivery, oversight and monitoring, and inspection and intervention.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                          3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  A technical, financial, and institutional review together with a beneficiary&#13;
  survey constituted the water and sanitation profile. Priority issues were then&#13;
  defined which in turn informed the development of a vision and objectives&#13;
  for water and sanitation.&#13;

embryonic or absent (see Figure 2).                                                                          are caused by two main issues: drawing                               generally higher in the provincial and&#13;

      Box 2: Context of TMA DI Khan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Tehsil Municipal Administration (TMA) Dera Ismail (DI) Khan is located within District DI Khan of the North West Frontier&#13;
      Province (NWFP). The district comprises five TMAs: Paharpur, Kulachi, Draban, Paroa, and DI Khan. Two other provinces&#13;
      border this district: Punjab and Baluchistan.&#13;
&#13;
      The total population is approximately 493,000 and is located within 313 settlements (the majority of which are small or&#13;
      medium rural settlements) within 21 Union Councils. Poverty is widespread in the district; 47.6 percent of the population&#13;
      is living under US$1 per/day2 and other social indicators are below average (NWFP district-based Multiple Indicator&#13;
      Cluster Survey, 2001, P&amp;D Department, GoNWFP). About 60 percent to 70 percent of the population is covered by&#13;
      water schemes, but effective coverage is lower as up to half the schemes are dysfunctional or have water quality&#13;
      problems. Water is delivered by the TMA in urban areas and by Works and Services (W&amp;S) department in rural areas&#13;
      (Dera Development Authority also provides water in rural areas, but to a limited extent).&#13;
&#13;
      A number of administrative, political, financial, and institutional problems characterize TMA DI Khan. In such an&#13;
      environment, planning is ad hoc and crisis-driven. The WSP-SA project aimed to address this problem through the&#13;
      introduction of strategic planning methodologies.&#13;

&#13;
Addressing Municipal&#13;
Capacity Problems&#13;
&#13;
One of the first steps in building&#13;
municipal capacity is to diagnose or&#13;
categorize municipalities according to&#13;
their capacity and therefore their needs.&#13;
There are different ways of doing this,&#13;
using indicators that illustrate the&#13;
municipality's socioeconomic context,&#13;
as well as institutional and financial&#13;
capacity. Once assessed, municipalities&#13;
can then be categorized as low,&#13;
medium or high capacity, and specific&#13;
programs can be developed to assist&#13;
these categories.&#13;
&#13;
Lessons from the experience of&#13;
South Africa highlight that municipalities&#13;
with capacity constraints should be&#13;
supported and be given more time to&#13;
get the basic institutional building blocks&#13;
in place (that is, a focus on building the&#13;
capacity of the sphere) before&#13;
proceeding to complex processes.&#13;
Such building blocks include clarifying&#13;
roles and responsibilities, developing&#13;

  Box 4: Decentralization in South Africa&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  The South African approach to implementing its new local government system follows three broad phases:&#13;
  establishment, consolidation, and sustainability. Its experience with regard to municipal planning closely mirrors these&#13;
  three phases. Two planning processes are relevant here--integrated development plans (IDPs), which are municipal&#13;
  strategic plans; and water services development plans (WSDPs), which are sector plans for water and sanitation delivery.&#13;
&#13;
  The water service-planning context has evolved from an initially centrally-driven process, to a sector-driven process&#13;
  (WSDP), and ultimately, as the local government system has been established, to a sphere driven process (IDPs leading&#13;
  with WSDPs as part of this). Within each of these phases, there has been considerable confusion and frustration. The&#13;
  institutional, financial, planning, and service delivery characteristics of these phases are detailed below.&#13;

&#13;
  Planning methodology has shifted from the generation of vast amount of information (with limited analysis) and wish&#13;
  lists (projects not funded) to programs that are more coherent. These shifts have been enabled by legislative reforms,&#13;
  institutional reforms (assignment of powers and functions), fiscal reforms (consolidation of national capital grants and&#13;
  medium-term budgeting) and hands-on capacity support.&#13;

    Box 5: Building planning capacity: South Africa's PIMSS Program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    South Africa has developed a number of capacity-building tools to support municipalities in their new functions. These&#13;
    range from the development of guidelines and publishing of regulations, to providing funding in the form of conditional&#13;
    grants and providing hands-on technical support. The most effective of all these has been the hands-on support. In&#13;
    particular, the Planning, Implementation, Management Support System (PIMSS) Program provided for the placement of&#13;
    planning and implementation support units within all the district municipalities in the country for an initial period of two&#13;
    years, which has been extended. Staffed by two professionals and an administrator, these support units were able to&#13;
    ensure that almost all municipalities developed their integrated development plans. Quality varied greatly, but the key&#13;
    success of this approach is that there is now a base from which to improve, rather than a void to be terrified by! Recent&#13;
    reviews indicate a number of problems with PIMSS centers but this in no way negates the key role they have and can&#13;
    continue to play in implementing municipal reforms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                         11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
  TMA coordinating forums, of service providers involved in the delivery of&#13;
  water and sanitation, could be established. Creating such structures is&#13;
  necessary when there are different service providers with overlapping&#13;
  mandates. This helps build a unified approach.&#13;

      Box 6: Apex project management and technical assistance in Estonia&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Following Estonia's independence from the Soviet Union, Eesti Veevark was established as an apex institution to serve its&#13;
&#13;
      municipal owners with professional services related to investment activities as well as operation and maintenance. It was&#13;
&#13;
      established because the government understood that small individual municipalities would not be able to attract and&#13;
&#13;
      retain specialized professional staff that would be needed to modernize the country's water supply and wastewater&#13;
&#13;
      sector. This saw a division of responsibility where routine operations and maintenance were managed by municipalities&#13;
&#13;
      and specialist expertise was provided by Eesti Veevark. While municipalities own Eesti Veevark, they buy professional&#13;
&#13;
      services on conditions that ensure financial and legal autonomy of Eesti Veevark. This model is relevant for developing&#13;
&#13;
      countries with a scarcity of professional staff. It has been successful in extending technical assistance to all types and&#13;
&#13;
      sizes of municipalities.&#13;

      This model is self-financed through the municipalities purchasing the services.&#13;

It comprises two broad areas:&#13;
&#13;
· Creating an enabling environment&#13;

Components of a&#13;
Support Programme&#13;
&#13;
Three components of support&#13;
are suggested:&#13;
&#13;
Establishment support. This type&#13;
of support refers to general support&#13;
in building the TMA as an institution&#13;
and should focus on defining roles&#13;
and responsibilities, developing&#13;
organizational structures&#13;
based on powers and functions             A member of the maintenance staff at an age-old Dera Ismail Khan W&amp;S scheme.&#13;
&#13;
and assisting with change&#13;
management processes.&#13;
                                            Figure 5: Technical components of the support framework&#13;
This support should&#13;
also include financial support in&#13;
establishing the necessary logistical                                                  Reflecting on&#13;
resources (staff, buildings, vehicles,                                                Empirical Base&#13;
&#13;
and computers).&#13;
                                                                                      Lesson Sharing&#13;
Technical support. This refers to              Building Block Pilot                                                     Research&#13;
&#13;
support for TMA water and sanitation&#13;
functions. This technical support could&#13;
comprise four components--pilots,&#13;
research, toolbox (tools and                   Good Practice Pilot                                                       Tools and&#13;
                                                                                                                      Methodologies&#13;
methodologies), and specialist support.                                                 Innovation&#13;
These are illustrated in Figure 5.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                         Specialist&#13;
Each component of technical                                                               Support&#13;
&#13;
support is unpacked in Table 2&#13;
(on page 14).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Pilot TMAs are a key aspect in providing an empirical base to test new&#13;
approaches and reflecting on what is actually happening `on the ground'.&#13;
It is useful to have both a building block pilot and a good practice pilot&#13;
where innovative approaches can be tested.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

  Area              Technical support component&#13;
&#13;
  Pilots             Pilot TMAs are a key aspect in providing an empirical base to test new approaches&#13;
                     and reflecting on what is actually happening `on the ground'. It is useful to have both&#13;
                     a building block pilot (TMA grappling with establishment issues) and a good practice pilot&#13;
                     (a medium- to high-capacity TMA) where innovative approaches can be tested.&#13;
&#13;
  Research and       Reflecting on the empirical base provided by the pilots, research can be commissioned into the&#13;
  documenting        issues that TMAs are grappling with. In many cases, such research will focus on identifying and&#13;
                     documenting good practices which already exist. This research can then be used as an input to&#13;
                     developing tools and methodologies. Such research can also form the material for lesson sharing.&#13;
&#13;
  Tools and          There are a number of existing initiatives under way that could form part of a toolbox.&#13;
  methodologies      These are:&#13;
&#13;
                     ·    The TMA Profile. This can be refined through integrating the approaches of CIP II,&#13;
                          RWSS, and international good practice (in particular, South Africa's water services&#13;
                          planning data requirements).&#13;
                     ·    Water and Sanitation Planning and Procedures Manual. This is currently in draft form and&#13;
                          the experiences of TMA DI Khan should be integrated into this before it is finalized.&#13;
                     ·    Technical Manual. It will help the technical staff of TMAs in working out design, quantities, and&#13;
                          cost estimation of water and sanitation schemes. It is in the final stage of preparation.&#13;
                     ·    Spatial Planning Manual. It will assist TMA staff in (a) preparing tehsil and local&#13;
                          spatial plans, exercising control over land use and zoning; (b) land-subdivision and&#13;
                          development; and (c) enforcing municipal laws/rules/bylaws, and so on.&#13;
&#13;
                     Other tools that should be considered to reinforce catalytic interventions are:&#13;
                     ·    Development of a generic TMA service level policy which defines what levels of service&#13;
                          will be provided in which area.&#13;
&#13;
                     ·    Standard operating procedures. Existing procedures are available from the TMA&#13;
                          DI Khan project.&#13;
&#13;
                     ·    Project prioritization tools (a number of examples exist from the South African context).&#13;
&#13;
                     ·    Terms of reference for a TMA coordinating structure (forum) for water and sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
                     ·    Guidelines for contracting service providers (private sector, Union councils, and&#13;
                          Citizens' Community Boards. Such guidelines could include `model' terms of reference&#13;
                          and memorandums of understanding.&#13;
&#13;
                     ·    Model bylaws which outline service level standards within a TMA.&#13;
                     ·    Guidelines on how to link planning, implementation, monitoring, and reporting. This could&#13;
                          include terms of reference for monitoring committees.&#13;
&#13;
  Specialist support The lessons learnt highlight the need to focus on medium- to long-term mentoring support,&#13;
                     rather than short-term support. To this end, the creation of a support unit or vehicle that&#13;
                     supports a number of TMAs, possibly located at the district level, should be investigated.&#13;
&#13;
                     Lessons from such an approach could then be used to refine the model, which could then&#13;
                     be considered for broader roll-out.&#13;

Infrastructure support.&#13;
This support refers to funding&#13;
for infrastructure delivery.&#13;
There are already a number of&#13;
programs operational in this area,&#13;
most notably the collaboration&#13;
between the Government of Pakistan&#13;
and the World Bank (CIP II) and&#13;
DfID (RWSS).&#13;
&#13;
There are indications that funding&#13;
for infrastructure provision is likely&#13;
to expand considerably in the&#13;
near future.&#13;
&#13;
Roles and&#13;
&#13;
Responsibilities&#13;
&#13;
In taking such a framework forward,&#13;
there are roles and responsibilities&#13;
for all levels of government--federal,&#13;
provincial, district, tehsil, and Union.&#13;
&#13;
These are presented in Table 3.                   Lack of planning and regulation leads to wasteful utilization of scarce resources.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The pilot project in TMA Dera Ismail
            (DI) Khan focused on developing strategies to improve water
            and sanitation delivery within the context of LGO 2001. The
            core objective was to develop, pilot, and present a viable
            and replicable model to the Government of the North West
            Frontier Province (NWFP) for local government capacity
            building in the Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) sector. In
            the light of the broader focus on improving municipal
            management within the new devolution framework, the pilot
            has drawn lessons of good practice from recent experience of
            working with local governments in Pakistan and the region.
