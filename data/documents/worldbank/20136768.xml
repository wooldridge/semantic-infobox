&amp;#12;&amp;#12;Introduction&#13;
           World Development Indicators is a compilation of relevant, high-quality, and&#13;
           internationally comparable statistics about global development and the&#13;
           fight against poverty. The World Development Indicators database contains&#13;
           more than 1,300 time series indicators for 214 economies and more than&#13;
           30 country groups, with data for many indicators going back more than&#13;
           50 years. It intends to help users of all kindsâ&#128;&#148;policymakers, students,&#13;
           analysts, professors, program managers, and citizensâ&#128;&#148;find and use data&#13;
           related to all aspects of development, including those that help monitor and&#13;
           understand progress toward the two goals of the World Bank Group: ending&#13;
           extreme poverty by 2030 and promoting shared prosperity. Measures to&#13;
           monitor the two goals (the proportion of people living on less than $1.25&#13;
           a day at 2005 purchasing power parity; and the income growth of the bot-&#13;
           tom 40% of the population) are currently being reviewed and improved.&#13;
               The 2014 version of World Development Indicators is now available&#13;
           online in various formats at&#13;

              These Highlights present some of the key trends in topics such as pov-&#13;
           erty, health, education, gender, the environment, the economy, governance,&#13;
           investment, aid, trade, debt and capital flows. They are organized using&#13;
           the same structure as the World Development Indicators book: World view,&#13;
           which provides an overview of progress towards the Millennium Develop-&#13;
           ment Goals, People, the Environment, the Economy, States and markets,&#13;
           and Global links. Please note that the expected publication date for the&#13;
           2014 edition of the World Development Indicators book is May 2014.&#13;

                World view presents progress toward the eight Millennium Devel-&#13;
                opment Goals (MDGs), drawing on the charts of progress in online&#13;
                interactive visualizations (http://data.worldbank.org/mdgs). It comple-&#13;
                ments the detailed analysis in the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s Global Moni-&#13;
                toring Report, and it uses the same methodology to assess whether&#13;
                countries are on track or off track to meet the targets by 2015.&#13;
                    The target year of 2015 for the MDGs is now just around the&#13;
                corner. One important aspect of the MDGs has been their focus on&#13;
                measuring and monitoring progress; this has presented a clear chal-&#13;
                lenge in improving the quality, frequency, and availability of relevant&#13;
                statistics. In the last few years much has been done by both coun-&#13;
                tries and international partners to invest in the national statistical&#13;
                systems where most data originate. But weaknesses remain in the&#13;
                coverage and quality of many indicators in the poorest countries,&#13;
                where resources are scarce and careful measurement of progress may&#13;
                matter the most. While the focus will continue to be on achieving the&#13;
                MDGs, especially in areas that have been lagging, the international&#13;
                community has started to discuss what comes next.&#13;
                    The 2013 report of the 27-member High-Level Panel on the Post-&#13;
                2015 Development Agenda, convened by the UN Secretary-General,&#13;
                recognizes the important role of data and the challenge of improv-&#13;
                ing development data. It calls for a â&#128;&#156;data revolution for sustainable&#13;
                development, with a new international initiative to improve the quality&#13;
                of statistics and information available to citizens.â&#128;&#157; This is timely and&#13;
                welcome, as is the panelâ&#128;&#153;s call to â&#128;&#156;take advantage of new technology,&#13;
                crowd sourcing, and improved connectivity to empower people with&#13;
                information on the progress toward the targets.â&#128;&#157; Both governments&#13;
                and development partners should invest in national statistical sys-&#13;
                tems, where much of the data will continue to originate.&#13;

       2000 (www.un.org/millennium/declaration/ares552e.htm) as updated by the 60th UN General Assembly in September 2005. The revised Millennium Development Goal (MDG) monitoring&#13;
       framework shown here, including new targets and indicators, was presented to the 62nd General Assembly, with new numbering as recommended by the Inter-agency and Expert Group on&#13;
       MDG Indicators at its 12th meeting on November 14, 2007. The goals and targets are interrelated and should be seen as a whole. They represent a partnership between the developed&#13;
       countries and the developing countries â&#128;&#156;to create an environmentâ&#128;&#148;at the national and global levels alikeâ&#128;&#148;which is conducive to development and the elimination of poverty.â&#128;&#157; All indicators&#13;

        <abstracts>
            This report is an overview to the World
            Development Indicators 2014, which provides a compilation of
            relevant, high-quality, and internationally comparable
            statistics about global development and the fight against
            poverty. The database contains more than 1,300 time series
            indicators for 214 economies and more than 30 country
            groups, with data for many indicators going back more than
            50 years. It is intended to help users of all kinds
            (policymakers, students, analysts, professors, program
            managers, and citizens) find and use data related to all
            aspects of development, including those that help monitor
            and understand progress toward the two goals. Six themes are
            used to organize indicators: world view, people,
            environment, economy, states and markets, and global links.
            As in past editions, world view reviews global progress
            toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and provides
            key indicators related to poverty. Each of the remaining
            sections includes an introduction; six stories highlighting
            specific global, regional or country trends; and a table of
            the most relevant and popular indicators for that theme,
            together with a discussion of indicator compilation methodology.
