            The market for aid : understanding aid by

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The market for aid is changing. These
            days donors use a far greater array of instruments than in
            the past, and operate in a context of far larger private
            financial flows. Poor countries are growing richer, but
            there are legitimate doubts about whether the aid industry
            deserves credit. Measurement of the effectiveness of aid has
            not yet produced some of the results that would really help,
            such as credible ratings of aid agencies or rigorous
            randomized trials of specific programs. This information
            might pull the aid debate away from minimizing the costs of
            aid competition and toward trying to maximize the benefits:
            widespread experimentation and innovation.
