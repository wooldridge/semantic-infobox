Urbanization is occurring rapidly in Melanesia at               pressure, illegal connections, or unimproved sources&#13;
3-4% per annum. Due to unaffordable land and housing            such as open wells. Settlement sanitation is mostly&#13;
in formal urban areas, new migrants settle on marginal          provided through shared or private dry pit latrines that&#13;
land without formal legal titles (â&#128;&#156;informal settlementsâ&#128;&#157;).      are unsanitary and uncovered, or no latrines at all. The&#13;

between 30% and 65% by 2023.                                    The impact of poor water and sanitation services falls&#13;

            Urbanization is occurring rapidly in
            Melanesia at 3-4 percent per annum. Due to unaffordable land
            and housing in formal urban areas, new migrants settle on
            marginal land without formal legal titles (‘informal
            settlements’). These settlements are growing and new
            settlements are emerging within and on the outskirts of
            towns and cities across Melanesia, at a rate that outpaces
            efforts to serve them. Settlements in the Melanesian
            capitals of Suva, Port Vila, Honiara, and Port Moresby
            comprise 20 percent-45 percent of the city population and at
            current urbanization rates will be between 30 percent and 65
            percent by 2023. Information about informal settlements is
            scarce. This report provides a rapid review of water and
            sanitation services in the informal settlements in and
            around the capital cities of Solomon Islands, Fiji, Vanuatu,
            and Papua New Guinea.
