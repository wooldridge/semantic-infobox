                          Cosgrove, John H.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Interview conducted by Jochen Kraske and William Becker, on 1995-05-03&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Cosgrove covers his educational and professional background prior&#13;
to coming to the Bank in 1991 as Executive Director (ED) representing&#13;
the Western Pacific constituency numbering 12 countries. Starting at&#13;
the Australian Treasury in the early 60's, he worked mostly on&#13;
domestic economic analysis and policy issues which subsequently took&#13;
him to the Australian Mission to the European Community in Brussels in&#13;
1973, the OECD in Paris in 1974, back in Canberra in 1976 working on&#13;
international issues, a second posting overseas to the High Commission&#13;
in London (1982-1985), then back to the Treasury in Canberra until he&#13;
was appointed ED at the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Cosgrove discusses briefly the structure of the Australian&#13;
Government, its membership in the multilateral financial institutions,&#13;
and the Treasury's philosophical perspective and Australia's evolving&#13;
philosophical position on economic matters. According to Cosgrove, in&#13;
spite of the Treasury's orthodoxy it has undertaken quite a few&#13;
important reforms over the years, especially, in the area of&#13;
microeconomics which saw the removal of quite a few structural&#13;
barriers to economic growth and freeing up the market to the rest of&#13;
the world.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Cosgrove discusses his objectives and accomplishments as ED, his&#13;
chair's firm approach on the Bank's budget in general, and balancing&#13;
the various interests of the constituencies he represents. He stresses&#13;
the distinction between finance and development assistance, and&#13;
maintains that the Bank is more focused on financial transfers and not&#13;
sufficiently focused on economic development. In line with the&#13;
&amp;#12;Australian Treasury's underlying economic philosophy, he strongly&#13;
feels that self-help goes a long way; a principle that applies to&#13;
almost any country. To that effect, he talks of the Bank and Fund's&#13;
crucial role in bringing about a sound economic framework with&#13;
emphasis on capacity building, and points to the lack of effective&#13;
technical assistance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     In light of the general tendency of Board members to act as&#13;
Ambassadors, he stresses the specific role of an ED as a member of the&#13;
Bank's Executive Board as well as an official of the Bank. In that&#13;
context, he talks of his rapport with the shareholders and Canberra&#13;
specifically. He discusses Australia's weightier role as a bigger&#13;
stakeholder in the Asian Development Bank than in the Bank, at the&#13;
same time, cites the reasons for Australia's declining financial input&#13;
in both institutions and specifically in its IDA contributions, and&#13;
Australia's two major export markets in Asia, Japan and Korea, and the&#13;
Association of the Asia-Pacific Economic Corporation (APEC).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Cosgrove addresses the workings of the Board, his relationship&#13;
with its members, and the impediment of frequent turnovers. The review&#13;
of Board procedures, and his support of the recommendations of the&#13;
Haralz-Naim report. He elaborates on the ensuing reforms resulting in,&#13;
among other things, improved Board/Management relations but with still&#13;
rather limited informal contact, the Board's increased influence in&#13;
covering policy issues even though he still feels that the Board is&#13;
weak and should be more determined about its role as the decision-&#13;
making body of this organization. He opines on certain remedial steps&#13;
that he would like to see put into effect, offers a rationale of the&#13;
underlying tension between Management and the Board and, in that&#13;
context, assesses the roles of Presidents Conable and Preston.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     On Board representation, he talks of the advantages in having a&#13;
smaller Board and mentions the postponement of reviewing the Board's&#13;
structure and composition. Again, he discusses the need for effective&#13;
technical assistance, argues against the Bank's involvement in areas&#13;
&amp;#12;that lie outside of its comparative advantage, such as granting money&#13;
to U.N. agencies to help them finance their own operations, and&#13;
getting involved in micro-credit type facilities. He praises the&#13;
Bank's achievements on environmental issues, and the pivotal role of&#13;
the U.S. chair in easing pressures from environmentalists associated&#13;
with the execution of some Bank projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Cosgrove discusses the reasons why he does not favor an&#13;
inspection panel, the Bank's progress on the issue of women in&#13;
development, opines on the notion of the Bank as a 'bloated&#13;
bureaucracy' including its over generous remuneration, Management's&#13;
handling of staff reductions, his disappointment in seeing less coming&#13;
in the way of savings from higher productivity per employee-on which&#13;
he elaborates--than from lowering the number of employees, and&#13;
concludes in stressing the crucial role of the shareholders in&#13;
affecting change in terms of cost consciousness and accountability in&#13;
the Bank.&#13;
