P Rates of return are based on mean earnings by each subgroup according to their educational background. The rate&#13;
of return for primary education, for instance, compares costs and benefits between those with no education and&#13;
those with primary education over the period of working life. It is also found that the rate of return to basic&#13;
education is higher for girls than for boys in Ghana, justifying interventions targeting girls and poor children.&#13;

REPUBLIC OF GHANA&#13;
BASIC EDUCATION SECTOR IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1    The Government of Ghana has requested IDA assistance of SDR 34.7 million (US$50.0&#13;
million equivalent) to help finance the first (five-year) phase of a basic education sector&#13;
improvement program which will be implemented over the ten-year period 1996-2005, aimed at&#13;
improving: teaching and learning outcomes; access to primary and junior secondary education&#13;
(especially for girls and the poor); efficiency in resource management; and financial&#13;
sustainability.&#13;
1.2    This request is based on experience gained over nine years from a series of Government,&#13;
IDA and other externally funded activities in support of the national Education Reform Program.&#13;
It is in response to a constitutionally mandated requirement that universal basic schooling be&#13;
available to all young Ghanaians by the middle of the next decade.&#13;
2. THE EDUCATION SECTOR AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONTEXT&#13;
A. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL OVERVIEW&#13;
2.1    During the 1970s and the early 1980s, Ghana experienced a serious economic decline,&#13;
bringing a country which once had enjoyed a relatively high living standard compared with other&#13;
Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries down to bedrock. The economy had contracted by 2-3&#13;
percent per annum during this period. Since launching the Economic Recovery Program (ERP)&#13;
with support from the IMF, the World Bank and other donors, the Government has made thirteen&#13;
years of efforts at economic stabilization and structural adjustment. The economy has been&#13;
growing by an average of about 5 percent annually, or at around 2 percent per capita. The&#13;
Extended Poverty Studyl found that during the middle stages of the ERP, poverty had fallen&#13;
moderately. Sustained and even more rapid growth and more rigorous poverty-fighting activities&#13;
are necessary to improve the quality of Ghanaian life within a reasonable time-span.&#13;
2.2    Government has adopted a strategy of trying to accelerate growth and to achieve social&#13;
equity and poverty reduction, with agriculture and other parts of the private sector being the&#13;
main engines.2 Over the past few years, the macroeconomic situation has been less favorable.&#13;
Despite a successful turnaround in fiscal balance, annual inflation exceeded 60 percent in 1995.&#13;
It is important that all segments of the population also benefit from growth through participating&#13;
in economic activities. This requires all Ghanaians to be functionally literate and numerate.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Human resources development is ranked highly among the Government's key development&#13;
3&#13;
objectives; and basic education has a crucial role to play. Key social, economic and education&#13;
indicators for Ghana are shown in the Basic Data Sheet (Annex 1).&#13;
B. EDUCATION SYSTEM OVERVIEW&#13;
2.3    Since independence in 1957, Ghana's educational services have been financed and&#13;
provided mainly through the public sector, although private provision is an important part of&#13;
primary schooling and technical training. Due to the heavy dependence on public financing, the&#13;
macroeconomic turmoil of the 1970s and early 1980s plunged the country's education system&#13;
into severe decline. Between 1976 and 1983, expenditures on education by the Government fell&#13;
from 6.4 percent of GDP to 1.4 percent. A shortage of foreign exchange deprived schools of&#13;
textbooks and other essential instructional materials. A mass exodus of trained and qualified&#13;
teachers who were unsatisfied with poor conditions of service left nearly half of the primary&#13;
teachers untrained.  School buildings, furniture, and equipment deteriorated.  In 1987, the&#13;
Government initiated an overall education sector reform as an integral part of its national plan&#13;
for economic recovery. This process restructured the school system; revised the curricula for&#13;
primary, junior secondary school (JSS) and senior secondary school (SSS) levels; developed new&#13;
teaching and learning materials; provided in-service teacher training; raised teacher qualification&#13;
requirements; steadily replaced unqualified teachers; introduced several cost-saving/sharing&#13;
policies; and began the process of administrative decentralization. In the early 1990's, the&#13;
Government turned its attention also to the tertiary sub-sector, consisting of universities and&#13;
polytechnics. These institutions were coming under increasing strain owing to the huge increase&#13;
in social demand, in part brought on by the creation of mass schooling. Middle level technical&#13;
training is provided by a mixture of public and private providers, but it is widely regarded as&#13;
being non-responsive to changing labor market needs and the preferences of school leavers.&#13;
2.4    Structure. Ghana's current education structure is still in the consolidation stage. Prior&#13;
to 1987, education in Ghana consisted of a six-year Primary; a four-year Middle; a seven-year&#13;
Secondary (the first five years leading to the 'O' level certification and the last two leading to the&#13;
'A' level); and a three or four-year Tertiary. Legally it was possible to skip the middle school&#13;
years by passing the Common Entrance Examination in class 6 of primary grade. In reality,&#13;
however, the majority had to spend as long as 17 years for pre-university education. The&#13;
structural change has been one of the key elements of the reform. The new system consists of&#13;
primary (grades 1-6) and junior secondary (grades 7-9), together forming the Basic Education&#13;
(BE) cycle, followed by the senior secondary cycle (grades 10-12); and several forms of post&#13;
secondary education and training that include technical institutes, universities, polytechnics, and&#13;
teacher training colleges. The final replacement of the old structure with the new structure is&#13;
being completed during the 1995/96 academic year when the last cohort of students under the old&#13;
system graduates.&#13;
2.5    Dimensions of Basic Schooling. Ghana's nine-year basic education cycle is nominally&#13;
compulsory, and children are supposed to enter primary school at the age of six. Primary pupils&#13;
are promoted to the next grade every year except for pupils (up to 5 percent) with extremely&#13;
weak performance or poor attendance, who repeat with parental consent. In reality, quite a few&#13;
pupils are over-age, and about one-fourth of the average Primary One (P1) cohort drops out by&#13;
Ghana Vision 2020, Government of Ghana, 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
P6 (Annex 2-4-1). In the primary school, nine subjects are studied: English, Mathematics,&#13;
Science, Agriculture, Social Studies, Life Skills, Ghanaian Language, Cultural Studies, and&#13;
Physical Education. The lower primary classes (P1-3) are taught in the Ghanaian language&#13;
prevailing in the local community; for P4 and beyond, English is the language of instruction.&#13;
2.6    After completing the sixth grade, all pupils are automatically eligible to enroll in JSS&#13;
without being screened by examinations, subject to a place being available. JSS is expected to&#13;
equip those who wish to enter the world of work with the necessary basic skills, or to develop the&#13;
ability to continue study at SSS. Thus to meet these dual objectives, JSS curricula have been&#13;
restructured, and new syllabi and teaching materials developed for thirteen subjects - technical&#13;
and pre-vocational skills training have been added to the core primary subjects, with French as&#13;
an elective course.&#13;
2.7    The access and participation situation in Ghana compares favorably with the Sub&#13;
Saharan Africa (SSA) average, and with other countries with a similar level of per-capita&#13;
income. Yet for a country which aims to join the newly industrializing economies, Ghana is&#13;
facing a big challenge (Table 2-1 below). Global evidence demonstrates the importance of&#13;
widening opportunity for quality schooling at both primary and secondary levels. In the national&#13;
interest, efforts of the Government to strive for universal, quality basic education is not only a&#13;
constitutional responsibility, it is a prerequisite for the economy to grow and for poverty to be&#13;
reduced.&#13;

A combined gross enrollment ratio for JSS and SSS.&#13;
2.8    In primary school, a teacher covers all subjects with her/his class group; and is supposed&#13;
to be competent in at least two Ghanaian languages. Headteachers are nominally detached from&#13;
teaching so that they can concentrate on school management and supervision. In many cases, the&#13;
headteacher has class duties as well, leaving little time for proper school management. There are&#13;
some 63,000 primary school teachers and 31,000 JSS teachers in schools. National Service&#13;
provides additional temporary teachers, some 2,000 for primary and over 5,000 for JSS&#13;
respectively who serve for two years. This makes a theoretical pupil/teacher ratio of 31:1 in&#13;
primary and 20:1 junior secondary (Annex 2-2-2), although these national average figures do not&#13;
capture the reality in many districts of overcrowded classrooms, a shortage of teachers, and in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
JSS, a big difference in the student/teacher ratio by subject (Annex 3-2-8). As well, there are&#13;
over 4,500 Ghana Education Service (GES) staff who are qualified as teachers but serve in&#13;
administrative positions at headquarters, regional and district offices and at religiously-based&#13;
educational units (Annex 2-6). To become a qualified teacher now, one has to be a graduate of&#13;
either a teacher training college or SSS, and has to have been awarded a teacher certificate.&#13;
Previously, many became teachers after completing the middle school, and without having any&#13;
professional training.  The situation has improved, and presently around three-quarters of&#13;
primary teachers and two-thirds of JSS teachers are at least minimally trained and certified&#13;
(Annex 2-5). The Ghana National Association of Teachers (GNAT) counts among its members&#13;
all teachers at public schools and those teachers at private schools who are on a fixed term&#13;
secondment from the public sector, as well as those with qualification for teaching but presently&#13;
holding administrative posts.&#13;
2.9    Private Sector. Until now, Government policy on private sector provision of schooling&#13;
may be described as lightly regulated laissez-faire. Private primary and to a lesser extent JSSs&#13;
are currently spreading at a higher rate than public schools, mostly in urban areas. There are at&#13;
least 900 private primary schools, accommodating about ten percent of primary enrollment&#13;
nationally. In addition, there are 200 private JSSs enrolling some 30,000 students, about six&#13;
percent of all JSS enrollments. These private schools charge instructional and other fees, and&#13;
pay their own teachers while the Government provides textbooks and some other consumables.&#13;
Fees presently range from 25,000 cedis to 65,000 cedis per term, with extra charges ranging&#13;
between 5,000 and 10,000 cedis a year. GES certifies private schools and has tried to regulate&#13;
fees, but has met with resistance on the latter from the private schools lobby. There are also&#13;
several "international" schools offering high cost (and high quality) services to the national and&#13;
expatriate elite without any support from the Government.&#13;
2.10   System Administration.  The Government, through MOE, is responsible for basic&#13;
education policy. MOE has four core functional divisions: Planning, Budgeting, Monitoring and&#13;
Evaluation (PBME); Manpower Development, Training and Personnel Policy and Management;&#13;
Statistics, Information Management, Public Relations and Research; and General Administration&#13;
and Finance. In addition, there is a Project Management Unit (PMU), staffed mainly on a&#13;
contract basis, to facilitate the administration of externally funded projects. MOE is supported&#13;
operationally by the Ghana Education Service (GES), which was established in 1974, largely as a&#13;
result of pressure from the Ghana National Association of Teachers (GNAT), to promote a sense&#13;
of collegiality, accountability and peer discipline among teachers. GES, with offices at Accra,&#13;
the ten regions and 110 districts, delivers and supervises education services. All public pre-&#13;
tertiary teachers belong to GES. Each district, under the Local Government Act of 1988, is&#13;
responsible for providing and maintaining basic school infrastructure. Teachers, and teaching&#13;
and learning materials, are provided by MOE to all government schools.&#13;
2.11   Government Financial Commitment. The Government's current emphasis on the&#13;
importance of education in the development process has been reflected in the budget for&#13;
education. The education budget as a percentage of GDP has increased from the pre-ERP's low&#13;
level of 1.4 percent in 1983 to 3.2 percent in 1989, and further to 3.8 percent in 1994 (Annex 3-&#13;
1). Hence, Ghana has shown relatively strong fiscal commitment to the education sector during&#13;
its decade of structural adjustment. The proportion of the Government's annual discretionary&#13;
budget allocated to education has averaged nearly 39 percent over the last five years, on an&#13;
actual spending basis. Intrasectoral allocation since the educational reforms began in 1987 has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
been in favor of basic education which has consistently received 60 percent or more of MOE's&#13;
budget.&#13;
2.12   Financing the Basic Education Sector. Over the last four years, of the total amount of&#13;
basic education recurrent expenditure, the Government has contributed about two-thirds,&#13;
households about a quarter, and donors about 10 percent (Annex 3-1-3). For capital costs,&#13;
districts are the major source of in-country domestic spending and on average they share the load&#13;
equally with external aid partners, although contributions toward capital expenditures fluctuate&#13;
significantly. Two major sources of funding for districts are the District Assembly Common&#13;
Fund (DACF), a centrally distributed intergovernmental (i.e. national to district level) transfer of&#13;
5 percent of the national tax revenue; and funds generated by the districts themselves, with&#13;
education levies accounting for most. The Government has thus been responsible mainly for&#13;
recurrent expenditure, predominantly salary and administrative costs.  Its spending on&#13;
infrastructure and instructional materials has been very minimal; which has been compensated&#13;
for by donors.&#13;
2.13   Despite substantial real increases over the years which have made teacher salaries&#13;
relatively higher than those for civil servants of comparable rank, remuneration is still felt to be&#13;
inadequate by many teachers. This contributes to alienation and to the inclination to pursue&#13;
other income-generating activities.  Making sufficient resources available for non-salary&#13;
expenditures in schools to improve the quality of education outcome while maintaining teacher&#13;
motivation through attractive incentive packages are challenging tasks.&#13;
C. KEY ISSUES IN BASIC EDUCATION&#13;
2.14   Since establishing a joint forum with resident donors in 1994, MOE/GES has been&#13;
engaged in collaborative sector studies. A top-level task group was formed by the Minister for&#13;
Education to oversee the preparation of reports prepared by professional study teams involving&#13;
local experts, and a series of participatory workshops has been held involving stakeholders.&#13;
Parents, community leaders, district and regional officers, teachers, parliamentarians, and&#13;
MOE/GES staff have all contributed to producing analytic reports that have identified the main&#13;
issues which have been addressed in the MOE's Strategic Plan for Universal Basic Education&#13;
(FCUBE).&#13;
2.15   The key issues in basic education flowing from the process outlined above can be&#13;
categorized into four broad areas as follows: (a) poor teaching and learning outcomes; (b)&#13;
inadequate access to education services; (c) weak management capacity at all levels of the&#13;
system; and (d) unsatisfactory financing arrangements.&#13;
Poor Teaching and Learning Outcomes&#13;
2.16   Over the past decade the present education system has been rebuilt on the ruins of its&#13;
predecessor. However, despite increased resource inputs and enrollments, the reform movement&#13;
has had very limited success so far in improving the quality of teaching and learning outcomes.&#13;
Pupil achievement continues to be very disappointing. Criterion referenced tests conducted&#13;
through a USAID project (PREP) on a sample of P6 pupils over the last few years continue to&#13;
show appalling results. In 1994, only three percent of the pupils tested attained satisfactory&#13;
scores for English, and merely 1.5 percent for mathematics (Annex 2-3). If the basic education&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
system continues to fail to produce acceptable outcomes, it will become politically difficult for&#13;
the Government to maintain such a large share of budgetary resources for schooling, parental&#13;
confidence will be totally eroded, and a downward spiral will negate the considerable progress&#13;
over recent years as measured by a number of important indicators.&#13;
2.17   Causes identified for this problematic situation include:  (a) lack of instructional&#13;
materials and equipment despite the considerable external funding for them over recent years,&#13;
and even where available, teachers often do not make effective use of them; (b) inadequate&#13;
spending on non-salary recurrent items, especially at the school level; (c) high levels of pupil and&#13;
teacher absenteeism; (d) insufficient teacher-pupil instructional contact hours; (e) inappropriate&#13;
pre-service teacher training and inadequate in-service teacher training; (f) unmotivated teachers&#13;
owing to ineffective supervision, unattractive incentives and low societal regard of the teaching&#13;
profession; (g) an overly ambitious curriculum, burdensome to both teachers and pupils and; (h)&#13;
didactic modes of teaching, namely, rote memorization and copying from the blackboard.&#13;
Furthermore, many private and some public schools, especially some religiously based, do not&#13;
actually provide the regular courses. A complicating issue is the language of instruction: poor&#13;
rural children tend to have almost no access to spoken or written English in everyday life. In the&#13;
lower primary school in which children's mother-tongue is supposed to be the language of&#13;
instruction, insufficient supply of both educational materials and teachers who can communicate&#13;
in local languages means that few pupils learn the skills of reading and writing even in their&#13;
native language. The majority therefore have no linguistic framework to help them become&#13;
literate in English as a second language. While recognizing that, as in most multi-linguistic&#13;
countries, this is a political as much as a pedagogical issue, it is nonetheless having a devastating&#13;
effect on the learning of core skills.&#13;
Lack of Management Efficiency&#13;
2.18   Improving the effectiveness and efficiency of MOE/GES cannot be achieved through&#13;
action in the education sector alone. A collective effort is required which will involve a wide&#13;
range of stakeholders - other Government and public sector agencies, particularly the Ministries&#13;
of Finance and Local Government, Office of the Head of Civil Service (OHCS), and the National&#13;
Development  Planning  Commission  (NDPC),  communities  and  employees/unions&#13;
representatives.  Nonetheless, immediate strengthening of the management capacity of&#13;
MOE/GES is required. Some of the immediate management issues to be addressed are&#13;
summarized below&#13;
2.19   Effective management of basic education depends upon the institutional capabilities of&#13;
five agencies - the twin bureaucracies of MOE and GES at the central, regional and district&#13;
levels, the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the OHCS, and the schools themselves,.  MOE&#13;
formulates education policy, sets sectoral objectives, determines sub-sectoral resource allocation&#13;
and monitors the provision of services. GES has its own enabling legislation, the Ghana&#13;
Education Service Act of 1994, and provision for a Governing Council. It is the technical&#13;
implementing arm of the education sector. While MOE is a civil service agency and GES a&#13;
subvented one, to all intents and purposes they are administratively and budgetarily interrelated&#13;
in their day to day operations. MOF holds the budgetary and resource allocation levers, although&#13;
MOE/GES are expected to manage their allocations within prescriptive guidelines. OHCS&#13;
controls the appointment of new personnel and senior managers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
2.20   Significant efforts have been made over the years to enhance the responsibility and&#13;
authority of the GES District Education Offices (DEOs). In line with this, it is envisaged that the&#13;
role of the Regional Education Offices would be one of coordinating and monitoring. Recently&#13;
DEOs were given extended authority over some staffing matters, especially promotions,&#13;
although the majority of personnel decisions, particularly those concerning appointments and&#13;
severe discipline, continue to be taken centrally within the GES. In practice, the regions&#13;
continue to play a significant managerial role in the preparation of budgets, although this is&#13;
expected to change with the advent of financial decentralization.&#13;
2.21   Restructuring. In 1995, the GES initiated a review of its management structures at&#13;
headquarters, regional and district levels in order to bring authority and responsibility for&#13;
services closer to communities. As part of this process a workshop was conducted in March&#13;
1996 for MOE/GES managers, District Assembly members and headteachers in order to&#13;
determine management responsibilities at different levels, to define the relationships between&#13;
key bodies and to formulate priorities for institutional strengthening. The results of this exercise&#13;
are set out in Annex 8. This has been motivated both by the pressing requirement to reduce non-&#13;
school based payroll costs in order to make more resources available for schools; and by the&#13;
political imperative to decentralize functions. The dilemma is that increased decentralization,&#13;
whether administratively or politically motivated, often leads to demands for additional&#13;
administrative staff and hence larger payrolls. The restructuring of GES, which is necessarily&#13;
coupled with that of MOE, is being conducted in line with the National Institutional Renewal and&#13;
the Civil Service Performance Improvement Programs (NIRP/CSPIP), the Government umbrella&#13;
arrangement for public sector and financial management reform. The systemic issues arising&#13;
from workshops, together with the outputs of beneficiary surveys, are currently being analyzed.&#13;
These will form the basis for actions to address system-wide constraints to public sector&#13;
performance and good governance. The restructuring of MOE/GES and the development of&#13;
improved management systems and skills will need to be facilitated by, and harmonized with,&#13;
this broader process.&#13;
2.22   Decentralization. The restructuring referred to above involves significant delegation of&#13;
operational decision making to the district level. Hence it will give due regard to the local&#13;
government reform movement which has been pursued since 1988 in order to promote popular&#13;
participation in development by devolving powers and responsibilities for service provision to&#13;
elected District Assemblies. As a result of the Local Government Acts of 1988 and 1993,&#13;
District Assemblies have a legal mandate to take over specified Government services including&#13;
the primary and junior secondary schools. District Education Oversight Committees (DEOCs)&#13;
are in the process of being established (Annex 6). In order to effect this transfer of authority,&#13;
responsibility and accountability for services to the District Assemblies, additional enabling&#13;
legislation such as the passage of the Local Government Service Bill will be required. Further,&#13;
"Common Funds" have been established to enable District Assemblies to meet capital&#13;
expenditures for all sectors. In time, recurrent budgets may also be devolved to the Assemblies.&#13;
Accordingly, the restructuring and decentralization which will take place within the MOE/GES&#13;
will need to pave the way, ultimately, for full devolution of basic education services to the&#13;
District Assemblies.&#13;
2.23   Devising improved and decentralized management structures and achieving clear roles&#13;
and decision making authority are necessary but not sufficient conditions for institutional&#13;
effectiveness. A number of other critical management issues need to be addressed to enable the&#13;
MOE/GES to achieve its basic education goals. These are summarized below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
2.24   Organization  Culture.   Whilst proposals are being  developed  to  streamline&#13;
management and to delegate authority to the districts, a management culture which is rooted in&#13;
centralized decision making and administration by formal directives remains largely intact.&#13;
Resistance to change can be anticipated from some. Pre-emptive action is required to counteract&#13;
impedance of further operational delegation and local initiative.&#13;
2.25   School Supervision. Inadequacies in the supervision of schools, both by district level&#13;
officers and headteachers, and the limitations of disciplinary processes are seriously undermining&#13;
effective teaching. Of particular concern are the quality and impact of school inspections and the&#13;
degree of professional independence of the inspectors and circuit supervisors. The absence of an&#13;
appropriate performance management framework which sets out clear and relevant&#13;
accountabilities for monitoring purposes simply compounds the problem.&#13;
2.26   Educational Management Information. School census and survey data critical for&#13;
planning and resource allocation are consistently reported too late to be of practical use. As a&#13;
result, user units tend to collect their own information independently. This results in duplication&#13;
of effort, data inconsistencies and validity problems, as well as overburdened district officials&#13;
who are charged with data collection. The fact that units tend to operate in isolation further&#13;
inhibits informnation sharing and exacerbates the problem.&#13;
2.27   Management Skills. There is a dearth of capable managers at all levels of the system&#13;
because they have traditionally been selected on the basis of their teaching qualifications and&#13;
experience. Subsequently very few receive any significant management training. Inadequacies&#13;
in the supervision of schools, both by district education officers and headteachers, and the&#13;
limitations of disciplinary processes are seriously undermining effective teaching and learning.&#13;
Such weaknesses are reinforced by the absence of an appropriate performance management&#13;
framework which sets out clear and relevant accountabilities for monitoring purposes.&#13;
2.28   Community Involvement. An important question is how communities can become&#13;
more involved in the management of schools through the new School Management Committees&#13;
(SMCs) and DEOCs recently legislated in the GES Act of 1995. Although parents are officially&#13;
expected to play a more active role in school management, many continue to see their role as&#13;
providing supplementary financial support only. This is partly due to some confusion between&#13;
the roles of the PTAs and the SMCs and partly because teachers do not always welcome parental&#13;
"intrusion".&#13;
2.29   Resource Allocation. There is a general shortage of instructional materials especially in&#13;
primary schools and of trained teachers particularly in rural areas. There are also weaknesses in&#13;
the resource distribution system and the teacher posting system, resulting in considerable&#13;
inequities between schools, regions and districts (see para. 2.35). These problems are partly due&#13;
to absolute resource limitations but can be attributed largely to failure in the resource allocation&#13;
process which allows prior claim to personnel emoluments and to advantaged areas.&#13;
2.30   Rewards. Currently there are few incentives available to teaching and non-teaching&#13;
staff, beyond the standard remuneration and conditions of service, to encourage and reinforce&#13;
good performance. Specific performance-related rewards to motivate staff and salary range&#13;
decompression to attract and retain people in positions of high responsibility, have to be devised&#13;
and implemented.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
Unsatisfactory and Inequitable Access and Participation&#13;
2.31   Basic education enrollments have been increasing.  Enrollment in public primary&#13;
education increased by more than 25 percent during the 1988-93 period from 1.6 million to 2.0&#13;
million. Enrollment in private schools increased relatively more rapidly from about 134,000 to&#13;
225,000. But because of population growth, enrollment ratios have been stagnating despite&#13;
overall enrollment increases (see Table 2-2 below). The gross enrollment ratio presently stands&#13;
at 78 percent for primary with 85 percent of children at age 6 entering the first grade (P1); and at&#13;
61 percent for JSS. Enrollment ratios in the north, where girls comprise only 35 percent of&#13;
primary enrollments and as little as 25 percent in junior secondary, are up to 30 percent lower&#13;
than the national average (Annex 3-2-8). Girls' enrollment ratios continue to decrease steadily&#13;
through the grades (Annex 3-2-2). The direct and indirect costs of education together with&#13;
parents' lack of confidence in the education system are discouraging poor families from sending&#13;
their children, particularly girls, to school.&#13;

2.32   During 1988-92, the number of public primary schools increased from 9,368 to 11,270.&#13;
The mid-term review of the IDA-funded Primary School Development Project (PSDP) found&#13;
that some districts, particularly in the north, put in a significant part of their budget for&#13;
schooling. But due to limited financial capacity and inefficiency in resource management by the&#13;
districts which are legally responsible for basic education infrastructure, the need to construct,&#13;
maintain and rehabilitate school facilities is far from being met satisfactorily. Despite MOE's&#13;
guideline that all children should not have to walk more than 5 km to school, in rural areas, many&#13;
children walk in excess of 8 km.  Progress through PSDP and other donor support&#13;
notwithstanding, classes under trees are not unusual; and many schools do not have protection&#13;
from rain or wind. The absence of systematic school mapping does not enable MOE to monitor&#13;
the actual condition of infrastructure or to determine relative needs for rehabilitation and&#13;
construction of new schools.&#13;
2.33   Weak Community Involvement.  The majority of parents have not yet regained&#13;
confidence in the public school system because of its perceived poor value for money. At&#13;
present local communities have a limited role in the running of primary and JSSs: extra-&#13;
curricular activities organized by Parent Teacher Associations (PTAs) are the most usual form of&#13;
involvement. For this reason, communities feel little ownership of the schools their children&#13;
attend; and frequently are mistrustful of attempts by the authorities to solicit community&#13;
involvement lest it be an excuse for extracting additional financial contributions. MOE is aware&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
that new approaches to community participation need to be actively pursued. Draft constitutions&#13;
have been prepared for the legislatively mandated SMCs at the primary and JSS levels. These&#13;
committees have a potential role to play in relation to the new DEOCs and to District&#13;
Assemblies. However, the SMCs as presently constituted will have limited influence as&#13;
governing bodies until significant management responsibility is transferred to the schools&#13;
themselves.&#13;
2.34   The key to successful community participation is to ensure that, having regard to distinct&#13;
features, local people have a real influence over decisions which affect the quality of education&#13;
their children receive. Ultimately, communities are likely to reject mechanisms which are seen&#13;
as simply advisory or established to "rubber stamp" decisions taken by school or system&#13;
officials.&#13;
2.35   Geographical Disparities. There are multiple disparities among regions. In 1992, the&#13;
total gross enrollment ratio (including both public and private schools) for primary education&#13;
was high in Volta, Ashanti and Greater Accra (ranged from 90 to 86 percent), much higher than&#13;
the national average of 77 percent, while low in Upper East, Northern and Upper West ranging&#13;
from 53 to 46 percent. The three regions with the lowest enrollment are also the three poorest&#13;
regions. The private sector is especially active in Greater Accra, currently accommodating 36&#13;
percent of total primary enrollment, and in Ashanti (14 percent), the two regions with the&#13;
country's biggest cities (Annex 3-2-7). Regional spending patterns, however, do not show&#13;
evidence of action to mitigate this inequity. Upper East and Upper West, two of the most&#13;
disadvantaged regions, spent only US$22-23 per primary school pupil in 1994 against the&#13;
national average of US$52 (Annex 3-2-9).&#13;
2.36   The Poor. The fact that provision of basic education infrastructure is the responsibility&#13;
of district governments and local communities works unfavorably against poor areas because of&#13;
their lesser fiscal capacity, despite supplementary financial support by the central government.&#13;
Also, there are various direct and indirect costs of schooling.  The Bank's poverty study on&#13;
Ghana shows that children without access to basic education predominantly belong to families of&#13;
the poorer segment of the population (Annex 3-2-4). In efforts to mobilize resources locally for&#13;
school maintenance, many districts, PTAs, and schools impose levies or fees. These additional&#13;
costs further deny access by the poor. Many school-age children are contributing to family&#13;
income in one way or another. For poor parents, the high direct costs of schooling, the critical&#13;
importance of income earned by their children, and uncertainties about future higher earning&#13;
deriving from participation in basic education, all contribute to their opting not to send all the&#13;
children to school. The very poor households spend only half as much on primary education as&#13;
the richest households do (Annex 3-2-5). In rural areas, where most of the poor reside in Ghana,&#13;
households spend less on, and benefit less from, education than households in urban areas&#13;
(Annex 3-2-6).&#13;
2.37   Girls. Access of girls to basic education, although gradually improving, is a major issue&#13;
among gender concerns in education. On the encouraging side, particularly at the JSS level, the&#13;
gross enrollment rate increased from 43 to 51 percent in the last five years, and the retention rate&#13;
is also improving. Less improvement is seen at the primary level (Annex 3-2-1). However, at&#13;
all grades of schooling, girls enrollment is lower than that of boys. Out of every 100 girls&#13;
enrolled, 72 reach P6 and 51 reach JSS3, against the boys' 80 and 63, respectively. Such&#13;
disparities increase in the north. Studies in Ghana show that in addition to the factors militating&#13;
against the children of poor families attending school, factors known to impede the participation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I1&#13;
of girls include: high opportunity costs of education for girls who are needed for household and&#13;
child care and parents' perception of boy's superior returns to education; socio-cultural barriers&#13;
to girls education, and traditional early marriages; lack of parent/community awareness of the&#13;
benefits of girl's education; inability of parents to pay for the education of all their children,&#13;
leading to prioritizing of boys; inappropriate domiciliary and hygiene arrangements associated&#13;
with schools; and insufficient role modeling by women teachers. These access, retention and&#13;
performance problems are sourced as much on the "demand" side (i.e. household behavior and&#13;
cultural attitudes) as on the "supply" side (i.e. education policies and school facilities). Table 2-&#13;
3 summarizes these disparities at the district level.&#13;

Inadequate Financing Arrangements&#13;
2.38   The education  sector has been  receiving  36-40  percent of the  Government's&#13;
discretionary recurrent budget (net of debt servicing and other extra-budgetary items); and&#13;
around 3 percent of the development (capital investment) budget. The expenditure side has been&#13;
constantly beset by uncertainties concerning salary obligations. During the past several years for&#13;
which expenditure data is available, MOE's actual expenditures have overrun the budget. Nearly&#13;
the entire overrun can be attributed to salary related expenses while in some instances the meager&#13;
amounts allocated to non-salary items have been underspent. The absence of a workable policy&#13;
to contain overall personnel emoluments, and of a reliable and timely expenditure monitoring&#13;
system are partly responsible for this poor financial management. In particular, data at the&#13;
district level, by the time it is consolidated at the regional level and forwarded to GES&#13;
headquarters, is out-of-date and is often inconsistent. The Government's central Integrated&#13;
Personnel Payroll Data (IPPD) system is expected to address this problem, although inaccurate&#13;
data processing sometimes plays tricks with names from the payroll. Internal resource allocation&#13;
within the basic education subsector is also heavily influenced by the sheer size of the wage bill.&#13;
Of total MOE/GES expenditures, personnel emoluments account for 85 percent. When looking&#13;
at school-level basic education expenditures, around 98 percent of the national budget allocation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
is absorbed by salary and related personnel costs with only a negligible remainder available for&#13;
school operation and maintenance. GES staff already account for over 40 percent of total public&#13;
sector personnel,4 but the policy goal of achieving universal primary education by 2005 indicates&#13;
the need for further increasing the number of teaching staff. Given that the education sector&#13;
receives more than one-third of the country's discretionary budget, it is essential to closely&#13;
monitor the size of the sector's salary envelope. Textbooks and other teaching/learning materials&#13;
are provided, but because the budgetary provision is so small, a substantial part of the costs of&#13;
textbook provision is presently financed by donors.&#13;
2.39   Inappropriate disbursement practices further impinge use of limited financial resources.&#13;
Due to uncertainty about the extent of outlays on the emoluments, MOE/GES does not seem to&#13;
effect procurement of goods until the third or even the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. This&#13;
often results in underspending of the already thin non-wage budget. Reallocation from salary to&#13;
non-salary budget lines has not been allowed. With the recent agreement between MOE and&#13;
MOF to undertake such internal reallocation, it is timely to establish a more user-friendly&#13;
budgetary system. A more transparent system of budgeting has to be developed: the present&#13;
system is extremely complicated and it is difficult to tell how much is actually spent on basic&#13;
education or any other level of education.&#13;
2.40   Funds for rehabilitation have been provided through support from  donors, NGOs,&#13;
Districts and local communities. The Government has spent almost nothing on capital stock for&#13;
basic education in the past decade, except for transfers to the District Assembly Common Fund&#13;
(DACF). Special resource transfers to the needier regions were made, but the level of support&#13;
has not been adequate. Until recently learning materials have been procured largely from&#13;
abroad. This caused a serious supply shortage when foreign reserves and donor support were not&#13;
available for this purpose. Moreover, even when textbooks have been procured, they have taken&#13;
too long to reach schools. Development of local capacity to produce and distribute learning&#13;
materials in a timely manner remains a challenge.&#13;
2.41   Until the concept of cost recovery was introduced under the Education Sector&#13;
Adjustment Credits (EdSACs), the Government had no scheme for sharing the financial burden&#13;
of public education. Textbook user fees of 0150 per pupil per year (later raised to 0250) were&#13;
introduced in the P3 through JS3 range to offset production costs (less the cost of paper which&#13;
was provided by CIDA). Also, students were charged for stationery items. Special revolving&#13;
funds for stationary and textbooks were established but were not administered effectively.&#13;
Primary education was regarded traditionally as being free of charges of any sort, and successive&#13;
governments continued to declare that it should be free and universal. In 1991, when MOE&#13;
imposed textbook fees for primary education, absolute enrollments dropped by 3.5 percent for&#13;
the first time in a decade. The memory of the "good old days" still affects many parents' notions&#13;
about the cost of education, and about who should bear them. Unlike decades ago when&#13;
schooling was for a privileged minority, it is a pragmatic necessity in an era of mass education&#13;
for governments to seek to establish cost-sharing arrangements to ease the burden on the public&#13;
purse: the issue, of course, is one of equity.&#13;
2.42   For cost recovery schemes to be effective, collection rates and appropriate policies have&#13;
to be addressed. It is MOE's intention to ensure basic education opportunities for all by reducing&#13;
Ghana's public sector has some 345,000 staff; of this number, over 155,000 are GES personnel.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
the actual private costs of the lower levels of public education and by increasing the proportion&#13;
of cost-recovery at the higher levels. This is consistent with the differential rates in the social&#13;
and private returns to schooling at different levels. Thus, in response to the decreased intake&#13;
into the P1, the Minister for Education announced in January 1995 that textbook fees would be&#13;
abolished for primary education. This policy decision was accompanied by a raising of the&#13;
textbook fees at JSS to ¢1000. MOE policy explicitly forbids a basic education pupil being&#13;
excluded for non-payment of fees of any sort on his/her behalf. Nonetheless, the de facto&#13;
compulsory nature of ancillary levies is reported to be still widespread, with its accompanying&#13;
exclusions.&#13;
2.43   Parents/guardians are asked to pay for exercise books, stationery, school uniforms,&#13;
lunch, transportation, and some other fees and levies which can amount to ¢5,000 per pupil&#13;
(US$3.25) in rural areas and to ¢ 12,000 (US$8.00) in urban areas. Table 2-4 shows some of the&#13;
fees paid for each pupil on average in 1992. For large poor families, this means fewer&#13;
educational opportunities, especially for girls and younger children. It is important that the&#13;
Government clarifies and wins support for guidelines as to which direct costs the household&#13;
should pay. This needs to be done in the context of overall sectoral financial planning.&#13;

D. PREVIous BANK OPERATIONS IN THE EDUCATION SECTOR&#13;
2.44   The  two main objectives of the education reforn that began in 1987 have been to&#13;
improve pedagogic coverage and to rebuild a financially sustainable education system. After an&#13;
initial emergency Health and Education Project (Cr. 1653-GH, US$5 million for education&#13;
sector), the implementation of the reform program was supported initially by the Bank through&#13;
the First and Second Education Sector Adjustment Credits (EdSACs). EdSAC I (Cr. 1744-GH,&#13;
US$34.5 million), which supported the first three years of the reform (1987-89) and closed on&#13;
December 31, 1991, focused on the reform process particularly at the basic level (primary and&#13;
JSS). EdSAC 11 (Cr. 2140-GH, US$50 million) supported the second phase of the reform&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
program (1990-92) to help consolidate the reform in basic education and extend it to the senior&#13;
secondary level. The EdSACs have been followed by projects that respectively support: primary&#13;
(Cr. 2508-GH, US$65.1 million), senior secondary (Cr. 2278-GH, US$15 million), and tertiary&#13;
(Cr. 2428-GH, US$45 million) levels as well as adult literacy (Cr. 2349-GH, US$17.4 million)&#13;
and vocational training in the informal sector (Cr. 2695-GH, US$9.6 million). In all, some&#13;
US$240 million has been committed by IDA over the past twelve years. The ongoing Primary&#13;
School Development Project (PSDP) is the antecedent to the proposed Basic Education Sector&#13;
Improvement Credit (BESIC), and will partially finance the start-up of the FCUBE Program&#13;
during 1996 until BESIC becomes effective.&#13;
E. OTHER DONOR SUPPORT FOR THE EDUCATION SECTOR&#13;
2.45   Over recent times, the largest donors apart from IDA have been: USAID, which&#13;
allocated US$35 million to primary education over a six year period (1991-96) and is currently&#13;
in the process of formulating a follow-on program of assistance within the framework of&#13;
FCUBE; ADB with US$20 million for tertiary education; CIDA with US$14 million mainly for&#13;
technical education; British ODA with US$8 million for literacy and basic teacher education;&#13;
Norway with US$8 million for literacy and school pavilions for basic education; and the OPEC&#13;
Fund with US$4.4 million for school pavilions and school sanitation. The EU is providing&#13;
earmarked adjustment funding to support non-salary recurrent expenditure in education. Other&#13;
donors include World Food Program (WFP) for school feeding; UNICEF for primary and pre-&#13;
school education; Switzerland for secondary school equipment; the Saudi Fund for secondary&#13;
school development; GTZ of Germany for vocational school development and UNDP and ILO&#13;
for institutional strengthening. KfW of Germany has recently completed its appraisal of a&#13;
project to rehabilitate teacher training colleges serving basic schooling; and is about to prepare&#13;
an implementation strategy in collaboration with GTZ, having regard to FCUBE. Various non-&#13;
governmental organizations (NGOs) have provided assistance.&#13;
F. LESSONS FROM PREVIOUS IDA AND OTHER DONOR INVOLVEMENT IN GHANA&#13;
EDUCATION&#13;
2.46   Some US$240 million of IDA credits have been approved for the whole education sector&#13;
in the past decade. Four projects are ongoing. The education reform movement at the school&#13;
level, fueled with IDA and other donor support, has seen a significant increase in enrollments&#13;
and a decrease in drop-outs, although participation rates are a problem due to high population&#13;
growth rates. But the outcomes of schooling are still far from satisfactory.&#13;
2.47   One of the most important conclusions of the two Implementation Completeion Reports&#13;
(ICRs) for the EdSACs as well as the recent mid-term review of PSDP is that continuing to&#13;
expand access to basic education and to increase physical inputs into the system are necessary&#13;
but not sufficient to ensure that the quality of teaching and learning at the school level improves&#13;
significantly. More attention has to be paid to the "software" (process) aspects of program&#13;
design and implementation. Institutional capacity matters a great deal in this context, without&#13;
which new "hardware" (inputs) and existing resources cannot be effectively utilized.&#13;
2.48   The recent ICR for the Community Secondary School Construction Project provides&#13;
equally important lessons: a community participation scheme may not work unless particular&#13;
needs and preferences, such as seasonal differences in the flow of income, are carefully&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
considered. Furthermore, the benefits of decentralization will not be realized without building&#13;
strong capacity at the community and district levels as well as at the central levels.&#13;
2.49   It is now necessary to harmonize development efforts to improve outcomes at the school&#13;
level while continuing to pursue the goal of universal equitable access. To this end, the&#13;
traditional project-by-project approach is being consolidated into support for the comprehensive&#13;
FCUBE Program, covering both development and recurrent activities.  The lessons from&#13;
previous IDA (and other donor) funded operations emphasize the importance of widespread&#13;
consultation and debate at the formative stage, close involvement by the "line" divisions of&#13;
MOE/GES and by districts in implementation arrangements, and adherence to agreed priorities&#13;
while allowing financing flexibility to accommodate periodic program modifications justified by&#13;
experience gained over time. For more efficient management of external support to basic&#13;
education, a MOE-donor forum was set up in August 1994 as an MOE initiative, and is now an&#13;
effective vehicle for regular communication and coordination among partners.&#13;
2.50   USAID, ODA and UNICEF programs in three areas of the country (Cape Coast,&#13;
Winneba and Afram Plains) have gathered experience in small-scale, integrated approaches to&#13;
primary school development, with strong emphasis on community engagement and teacher&#13;
motivation in the pursuit of improvements in the quality of teaching and learning.&#13;
G. RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT IN BASIC EDUCATION&#13;
2.51   MOE has affirmed that quality improvement of basic education must receive higher&#13;
priority from now on. The FCUBE program aims to achieve this through curriculum reform,&#13;
continual (re-)training and monitoring of personnel, increasing community participation, system-&#13;
wide management improvement, and steady expansion of access with priority to the neediest&#13;
groups. The FCUBE is the sole program for basic education, involving all current and future&#13;
activities supported by national resources and external donors. The FCUBE will help address&#13;
equity, gender and poverty issues in terms of access to basic social services as well as building&#13;
capacity in the education sector and encouraging a participatory development approach. These&#13;
are all in line with the Bank's own assessment of the situation and are underscored in the Bank's&#13;
Country Economic Memorandum and Country Assistance Strategy. Without the continued&#13;
involvement of the Bank and other donors in Ghana's education sector, the Government will&#13;
have extreme difficulty in furthering the reform process. The Bank's sector knowledge and&#13;
comparative familiarity with the integrated sector investment approach will be particularly&#13;
helpful to the Government in mobilizing continued donor support. The activities outlined below&#13;
are systemic in impact, affect all on-going basic education activities and structures, and promote&#13;
initiatives to meet demand for access and quality. IDA assistance, in addition to the support of&#13;
other donors, for MOE's Sector Strategy and Operational Rolling Plan, will underpin a holistic&#13;
solution to a complex development problem.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
3. THE BASIC EDUCATION SECTOR IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM&#13;
A. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.1    The long-term  national goal to which the FCUBE program  will contribute is an&#13;
empowered citizenry, regardless of the geographic region in which they live, their gender,&#13;
religion or ethnicity. By requiring that all Ghanaians receive 9 years of quality basic education,&#13;
the Government wishes to ensure that young people are prepared for further skills training either&#13;
in the work force or in formal study. The central goal of the basic education system in Ghana is&#13;
to ensure that all students are equipped with the capability to become full stakeholders in, and&#13;
beneficiaries of, development. The policy priorities, commitments and targets of the FCUBE&#13;
program for the period 1996-2005 are outlined in the Government's Letter of Basic Education&#13;
Sector Development Policy (Annex 4). IDA will support the Government's program, focusing&#13;
on issues of school-level quality improvement, more equity in resource allocation, greater&#13;
efficiency in resource use, expanded access, and increased participation. The Basic Education&#13;
Sector Improvement Credit (BESIC) will help consolidate the considerable progress made since&#13;
1987 by helping to (a) improve the teaching process and learning outcomes; (b) strengthen&#13;
management of the basic education system through better planning, monitoring and evaluation&#13;
by MOE/GES at central, regional and district levels, and by promoting active involvement of&#13;
communities in the management of schools; (c) improve access to basic education, especially of&#13;
girls, the poor and other disadvantaged segments of the population; and (d) ensure financial&#13;
sustainability of the Government program for basic education over the longer term.&#13;
B. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.2    The FCUBE program is documented by MOE in two volumes: (a) a Program containing&#13;
a statement of sector policy along with a description of the strategic framework and its&#13;
components; and (b) an Indicative Operational Rolling Plan.  The second volume will be&#13;
regularly updated in the light of experience and as additional sources of finance come on stream.&#13;
A draft of this volume was discussed during negotiations, and as a condition of Credit&#13;
effectiveness, the Government will finalize and adopt the Operational Plan, with specific&#13;
arrangements for activities to be carried out in 1996-98. The FCUBE program comprises three&#13;
components:  (a) enhancing pedagogic effectiveness through support to teacher education,&#13;
improved supervision, regular assessment of student performance, adequate provision of&#13;
instructional materials and periodic curriculum renewal; (b) developing and strengthening the&#13;
capacity for efficient management at the central, district and school levels; and (c) improving&#13;
access to basic education, especially for girls and the less advantaged groups, and encouraging&#13;
community interest and participation in the schooling process.  It will be necessary to&#13;
systematically design activities which explore the interactions between these components, in the&#13;
light of the best understandings of the factors that characterize effective education within&#13;
schools, focusing on, among others, school-level autonomy, school climate, the teaching/learning&#13;
process, and pupil evaluation/feedback by teachers.&#13;
3.3    The program will support wide-ranging strengthening of capacity at districts and schools&#13;
in the delivery of basic education. Among others, the development of leadership skills of&#13;
headteachers, the quality of supervision, and the engagement of the community through School&#13;
Management Committees (SMCs) will provide much more focused attention on issues relating to&#13;
the quality of schooling. The Government, with donor support, plans to work towards the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
integration of these components in pursuit of school improvement in selected districts,&#13;
attempting to develop models of best practice, and building on previous work described in para.&#13;
2.46-2.50. This approach would involve working with individual schools, clusters of schools,&#13;
individual headteachers, groups of headteachers, etc., in developing plans and strategies to utilize&#13;
the enhanced skill resource provided by the individual program components. It will be necessary&#13;
to provide detailed analytical data to monitor the improvements in the quality of pupil&#13;
performance in individual schools. It is expected that, as improvements of quality become&#13;
visible, community engagement will increase. The results gained from these models, as well as&#13;
from the proposed Schooling Improvement Fund (para. 3.23), will be applied to the national&#13;
program.&#13;
Component 1: Enhanced Quality of Teaching and Learning&#13;
3.4    The FCUBE program  recognizes and addresses the need to further upgrade the&#13;
professional skills of basic education teachers, both before they take their posts as well as after&#13;
they have served in their positions. This component will promote more effective teaching by&#13;
improving specific instructional skills through revamped in-service and pre-service training&#13;
programs and by motivating teachers through the introduction of new incentive and sanction&#13;
schemes. It will support the assessment of student performance to inform teachers, students and&#13;
parents of progress and to provide the MOE with more objective criteria to evaluate the&#13;
effectiveness of basic education.  Improvement in the quality of learning and student&#13;
performance will also be addressed through the provision of instructional materials, as well as&#13;
curriculum review and revision.&#13;
3.5    In-Service Training of Education Personnel. With the assistance of participating&#13;
donors, MOE plans to develop a program for in-service teacher training (INSET) that will rely&#13;
partly on distance education methods and technology and partly on face-to-face workshops&#13;
during  school vacations.   The INSET  program  will emphasize the acquisition  and&#13;
implementation of practical skills and the use of instructional materials to strengthen the&#13;
effectiveness of teaching. School-based training for teachers will be increased and support&#13;
provided to them through the development and improvement of Teacher Resource Centers.&#13;
Teachers' Training Colleges (TTCs) will receive support to train tutors who will work with&#13;
teachers in classrooms. This initiative will also ensure that graduates of TTCs have more&#13;
practical experience and awareness of the complexities of classroom instruction before they are&#13;
charged with managing a classroom on their own. Training for headteachers will seek to&#13;
strengthen their management and supervisory skills to ensure that they are supportive of reform&#13;
at the school level and are effective in helping to improve the skills of the teachers.&#13;
Headteachers will be required to attain accreditation standards after training programs in order to&#13;
hold positions. Circuit supervisors and district education officers will be trained to carry out&#13;
effective supervision of schools and to provide necessary support to the headteachers and&#13;
teachers. Orientation and mobilization workshops for key district officials and community&#13;
leaders will be conducted to encourage their active involvement in school activities. Training for&#13;
educational personnel at the district, regional and headquarters levels, some of which will be&#13;
undertaken as part of the activities in Component 2 (para. 3.10-3.17), will seek to improve the&#13;
efficiency and quality with which education data are processed, programs are supervised,&#13;
monitoring is improved, rules and procedures are enforced, and curricula and learning materials&#13;
are developed and disseminated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
3.6    Pre-Service Teachers' Training.  The existing basic education teacher pre-service&#13;
training program has been criticized for its overly academic focus, and for its lack of articulation&#13;
with the school curricula and the instructional needs of students. The FCUBE program will&#13;
support the redesign of the pre-service training programs, emphasizing hands-on training&#13;
activities in schools and increasing the amount of time in practical teaching prior to certification.&#13;
Access courses will be given to teacher trainees from deprived districts who may not have the&#13;
requisite minimum  entry qualifications.  Links between the schools and teacher education&#13;
institutions or qualified teacher educators of these institutions will be strengthened. As much as&#13;
possible, trainees belonging to a district will be selected for training and contracted to stay in that&#13;
district for a minimum specified period on completion of their course. Local communities and&#13;
district education offices will be asked to sponsor trainers, so that teacher development will be&#13;
demand-driven instead of being supply-driven as is currently the case. A study will be carried&#13;
out on the 38 TTCs, to define the specific roles to be played by each institution in the redesigned&#13;
pre-service training program, and to identify those which require rehabilitation (in conjunction&#13;
with support to be provided by KfW) and others which may be closed or merged. Linkages with&#13;
the University College of Education at Winneba (UCEW) and Cape Coast University will be&#13;
explored to maximize support for the training programs. Over the longer term, FCUBE will also&#13;
support studies on alternative delivery mechanisms and evaluation of the impact of the training&#13;
programs.&#13;
3.7    Assessment and Evaluation of Student Performance. Criterion-referenced testing of&#13;
the performnance of Ghanaian students currently enrolled in basic education has given tangible&#13;
evidence to the ineffectiveness of the system (para. 2.16). To help ensure that curricula and&#13;
teaching tools are used properly, a comprehensive set of evaluation mechanisms will be&#13;
developed and put in place. The monitoring scheme will measure both student mastery of&#13;
material as well as limitations in the teachers' abilities to implement the new curricula. Results&#13;
will be employed in the on-going process of curricula improvement, and in the training of&#13;
teachers. Emphasis will also be placed on enhancing the supervisory capacity of district&#13;
education officers to monitor the instructional process more effectively and to interpret the&#13;
results of both continuous assessment outcomes and standardized tests. Greater emphasis will be&#13;
placed on the development of strategies to facilitate remedial instruction in the classrooms for&#13;
those students in need of supplementary help.&#13;
3.8    Provision of Instructional Materials. The lack of instructional materials has been&#13;
identified as a crucial factor which affects the effectiveness of teachers' delivery in classrooms&#13;
and hence the poor performance of pupils (para. 2.17). The FCUBE program will support the&#13;
provision of textbooks, teachers' handbooks, syllabi, and library books to schools. Initially,&#13;
existing textbooks will be reprinted and distributed to schools, after making provision for&#13;
adequate school storage facilities. Subsequently, new textbooks will be produced following the&#13;
revision of the curriculum (see para. 3.9 below). MOE policy currently undertakes to provide&#13;
textbooks (assuming a book life of three years) for all core subjects (6 subjects for BE 1-6 and 10&#13;
subjects for BE 7-9) at a 1:1 book/pupil ratio. Textbooks will be provided free to all pupils in&#13;
BE 1-6, while pupils in BE 7-9 will continue to be charged a user fee. This policy will incur a&#13;
very significant charge against the total incremental resources of the FCUBE program. The MOE&#13;
is unlikely to be able to sustain such a flow without substantial assistance from other sources.&#13;
MOE will undertake a study on the options for the sustainable provision of learning materials,&#13;
taking into consideration the level of available financing, the potential for private sector&#13;
contribution, the printing (whether local or foreign) and distribution capacity, the storage&#13;
facilities in schools, and the systems for encouraging and monitoring the actual use of materials&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
in schools. This study is expected to be completed prior to the first government/donor review&#13;
(January/February 1997) of the three-year rolling plan for the FCUBE program, to provide the&#13;
basis for appropriate modifications to the implementation plan. The provision of library books&#13;
will also be included in this study.&#13;
3.9    Curriculum Review and Development. The first major task of this sub-component is&#13;
to review the existing materials available in the classroom for BE 1-9 pupils and teachers, in&#13;
terms of their value as learning tools in delivering the syllabus for each subject. New textbooks&#13;
will then be prepared and tested in a sample of schools in various regions in the country. In the&#13;
meantime syllabi will be drafted for the new subjects, including environmental studies for BE 1-&#13;
3, integrated science for BE 4-6, pre-technical skills for BE 7-9, and religious and moral&#13;
education for BE 1-9. Course material for Ghanaian languages will also need to be developed.&#13;
Subject panels involving outside specialists will be set up to review the syllabus for each subject&#13;
and revise/write the textbooks. The FCUBE program will support these activities and help&#13;
strengthen the Curriculum Research and Development Division (CRDD) in the GES to carry out&#13;
its functions.&#13;
Component 2: Management for Efficiency&#13;
3.10   The over-arching objectives for this component are to improve the efficiency of the GES&#13;
and to enhance its effectiveness in implementing the FCUBE program. In particular, the aim is&#13;
to strengthen the management of human and financial resources at the district level in order to&#13;
address the needs and aspirations of communities, parents and children. The design of the&#13;
component recognizes the public sector reform imperatives of the NIRP as well as the&#13;
implications of the Local Government Act of 1993 in the process of transferring to the districts&#13;
increasing responsibility and authority over basic education.&#13;
3.11   This component will support the decentralization of responsibility and operational&#13;
decision making within the existing institutional framework of MOE/GES.  It will help&#13;
strengthen managerial capacity to enable the District Education Offices (DEOs) of GES to use&#13;
their increasing autonomy responsibly by having qualified managers, relevant skills and&#13;
improved information, personnel and financial management systems. The plan is to focus upon&#13;
early results in terms of management strengthening (especially at the district and school levels),&#13;
and to avoid undue disruption. In the longer term, this approach will facilitate the gradual&#13;
devolution of responsibility and authority to the District Assemblies as capacity is strengthened&#13;
and the appropriate legal instruments are enacted. To help achieve these outcomes, the&#13;
Management for Efficiency Component of the FCUBE program is composed of five sub-&#13;
components, as outlined below.&#13;
3.12   Building Capacity for Institutional/Organizational Analysis and Change. This sub-&#13;
component will aim at helping to develop the internal capacity to lead and manage change on a&#13;
continuous basis, to ensure that managers, supervisors and headteachers are effective in carrying&#13;
out their new responsibilities in a decentralized system, and to enable communities to participate&#13;
in the management of schools. The following activities will be undertaken to help achieve these&#13;
objectives. First, an organization structure for the MOE/GES will be devised, specifying clearly&#13;
the relationships with external bodies, opportunities for contracting activities to the private&#13;
sector, new management accountabilities at all levels as well as the scope of delegated decision&#13;
making. The MOE/GES will develop legal or other normative mechanisms as appropriate to&#13;
facilitate cooperation between GES and District Assemblies in order that FCUBE objectives are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
achieved. Second, a human resource plan will be developed, specifying recruitment, transfer,&#13;
promotion and redundancy actions to meet the staffing requirements of the revised organization&#13;
structure. The plan will draw extensively on the results of a personnel audit of the numbers and&#13;
skills of existing staff which will update and extend the personnel database of the IPPD system.&#13;
Third. to help strengthen the agents and sponsors of change, orientation and training will be&#13;
conducted for both the technical staff of the nearly established FCUBE Secretariat and a&#13;
carefully identified core group of senior managers who will be appointed to positions of&#13;
responsibility and influence in the new organization structure. At the same time, commitment to&#13;
the revised organization design throughout the MOE/GES will be built up through a "cascading"&#13;
approach to staff consultations and briefings. Fourth, managers, supervisors and headteachers&#13;
throughout the system will be trained to exercise their new managerial roles and responsibilities&#13;
under decentralization, focusing on interpersonal, supervisory, planning and client consultation&#13;
skills. The training strategy will emphasize in-country programs specifically designed for the&#13;
GES and coaching skills for both managers and supervisors to enable them to help solve job&#13;
problems faced by their staff. The overall program design will be based upon a prior training&#13;
needs analysis. Circuit supervisors will be specifically targeted so that they are able to train the&#13;
large number of headteachers at the circuit level. Fifth, viable SMCs will be established by&#13;
initiating a dialogue with community leaders, clarifying their roles in relation to existing PTAs,&#13;
and subsequently providing them with support through both the DEOs and the District Education&#13;
Oversight Committees (DEOCs) which are in the process of being established. Finally, regular&#13;
implementation reviews of improved management structures and systems, focusing on the&#13;
DEOs, will be conducted by regional teams and supported by community representatives from&#13;
the District Assemblies and DEOCs. The FCUBE Secretariat will be responsible for conducting&#13;
reviews at the Headquarters and Regional levels.&#13;
3.13   Staffing and Personnel Management. This sub-component will help to achieve a&#13;
more efficient and equitable distribution of staff and teachers, strengthen personnel procedures&#13;
for a decentralized system and design more appropriate salary structures and incentive schemes.&#13;
It will include the following activities. First, clear and transparent procedures will be formulated&#13;
for the appointment and deployment of managers, supervisors and headteachers on the basis of&#13;
proven competence and identified potential in accordance with the manpower plan. Personnel&#13;
managers and officers will be trained in counseling skills in order to support and advise affected&#13;
staff during this difficult period. The IPPD personnel information system will be reviewed and&#13;
strengthened to ensure all staff movements are carried out efficiently and accurately. Second, the&#13;
job grade structure within the MOE/GES will be reviewed and revised to reflect new job&#13;
contents and skills within the revised organization structure for MOE/GES and to provide for&#13;
more appropriate salary differentials. This exercise recognizes Government's emerging public&#13;
sector incomes policy which aims to "de-link" the salaries of different bargaining groups. In&#13;
addition, an employee motivation strategy will be developed which emphasizes non-financial as&#13;
well as financial incentives and provides discretion for district education offices to design&#13;
locally-based schemes. Third, personnel policies and procedures for recruitment, promotions,&#13;
transfers and discipline will be revised to make them relevant to decentralized personnel&#13;
management in the DEOs. Special emphasis will be placed upon the development of a revised&#13;
code of professional conduct to support strengthened disciplinary procedures to give line&#13;
managers clear responsibility for initiating disciplinary action.&#13;
3.14   Performance Management. This sub-component will help design and implement an&#13;
education management information system (EMIS), and will introduce a performance appraisal&#13;
system which involves objective setting, regular performance review and corrective action. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
EMIS will be designed to support policy analysis and planning, the management review process,&#13;
and the monitoring of FCUBE program targets and standards. The design of the EMIS will build&#13;
upon the existing statistical system and the skills available in the MOE/GES, and will be closely&#13;
coordinated with other systems being used or to be developed in the context of the NIRP/CSPIP.&#13;
In addition, a school mapping exercise will be conducted to promote micro-planning. At the&#13;
same time, an improved performance appraisal system will be developed which links individual&#13;
performance to work unit objectives. This system will form the basis for establishing contractual&#13;
or other relationships with District Assemblies to ensure FCUBE goals are achieved in the&#13;
decentralization process. Mechanisms appropriate to a decentralized education system will be&#13;
established for monitoring, emphasizing performance indicators and management reports, with&#13;
clearly defined standards for different levels of management and procedures for the periodic&#13;
review of work programs and implementation plans. Financing for consultancy services for the&#13;
design and development of an EMIS will be financed under the ongoing PSDP. During&#13;
negotiations agreement was reached on a time-bound action plan for the operationalization of the&#13;
EMIS.&#13;
3.15   Budgeting and Financial Management. The objectives of this sub-component are to&#13;
ensure that MOE/GES budgets at all levels are prepared consistently in accordance with the&#13;
FCUBE program structure and established budget guidelines, to enable the MOE/GES to account&#13;
for its revenue from whatever source and expenditure on any item/activity in accordance with&#13;
established accounting standards, and to produce periodic financial management reports which&#13;
can be related to program outputs and outcomes from the EMIS. The current MOE/GES&#13;
budgeting and accounting system will be reviewed and an improved system will be designed to&#13;
provide relevant and timely management information. An agreed resource allocation formula&#13;
will be developed to facilitate the delegation of budgets to the district level by the end of 1997.&#13;
These activities will be closely coordinated with other ongoing central initiatives to strengthen&#13;
the public accounting systems, including the Government's PUFMARP and the Bank's&#13;
supporting FIMTAP operation.&#13;
3.16   District Capacity Building.  This sub-component will focus on strengthening the&#13;
capacity of DEOs and District Assemblies in planning and managing basic education, taking into&#13;
consideration the overall progress towards decentralization in the country. It will help develop&#13;
mechanisms for the GES, in association with other arms of the Government, to provide technical&#13;
assistance to District Assemblies. The performance of those Assemblies specifically targeted for&#13;
technical assistance will be closely monitored, in particular in terms of the functioning of their&#13;
Social Services Sub-committees and their use of Common Fund resources for educational&#13;
purposes. MOE will progressively delegate financial management discretion to districts having&#13;
viable education plans and administrative systems.&#13;
3.17   To help develop and strengthen capacity for the implementation of this component,&#13;
international ar,d local consultants will work closely with MOE/GES staff in specific activities.&#13;
A technical advisor with expertise in organization change will be engaged to help develop local&#13;
capacity and facilitate overall implementation of the component. In addition, consulting services&#13;
will be contracted to assist in the review and design of the personnel management system, the&#13;
EMIS, the performance appraisal system, as well as the budgeting and financial management&#13;
system. Consultancy firms which can access local expertise will be engaged to conduct the&#13;
technical work and to develop skills within GES to operate the improved systems and&#13;
procedures. Appropriate training programs will be designed and conducted for relevant staff.&#13;
Computer systems and equipment will be procured and installed as necessary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
Component 3. Improving Access and Participation&#13;
3.18   The overall objectives of this component are to promote wider coverage of the basic&#13;
education system through quantitative and qualitative improvements to school facilities and&#13;
through direct involvement of communities and parents in activities that will help improve the&#13;
environment for teaching and learning in their schools. Efforts will be targeted in particular to&#13;
promoting access for girls, the poor and for disadvantaged children in rural areas.  The&#13;
component will build on the experience gained in previous projects and pilot activities in Ghana&#13;
and elsewhere.&#13;
3.19   Infrastructure Development. Achieving the twin objectives of increased access and&#13;
improved quality will necessitate both a quantitative expansion of and qualitative improvement&#13;
in basic education facilities and support infrastructure. MOE will take stock of progress made&#13;
over recent years and rationalize the use of existing resources to maximize their effectiveness.&#13;
Some urban schools may need to adjust to double-shifts. At the same time, it will continue to&#13;
rehabilitate dilapidated classrooms and support construction of new school facilities including&#13;
classroom buildings and teachers' housing, based on relative need and demonstrated demand.&#13;
Initially decisions on school location and the type of facilities to be rehabilitated or built will be&#13;
based on data currently available from the school census, which will be verified through field&#13;
visits. Subsequently as data on schools and catchment population become available through the&#13;
EMIS and school mapping exercise (para. 3.14), MOE will prepare a phased implementation&#13;
plan for infrastructure rehabilitation and construction, based on selection criteria as shown in the&#13;
Implementation Manual and to be reviewed annually by MOE, district/community stakeholders&#13;
and participating donors. Indicators on poverty and girls' participation will be given prime&#13;
consideration in determining the selection criteria.&#13;
3.20   School Facilities Planning and Maintenance. With the aid of architectural engineering&#13;
firms, MOE will review and revise as necessary the existing norms and standard designs for&#13;
school facilities to enhance the opportunity for learning and to allow flexibility (e.g. multi-grade&#13;
schools, addition of classrooms).  The profile of school facilities (classrooms, libraries,&#13;
workshops, girls' boarding facilities) will be based, to the extent possible, on a common&#13;
structural module, possibly an adaptation of the three classroom pavilion currently used in&#13;
building new primary schools, to allow for flexibility in facilities utilization and efficiency (cost&#13;
and time) in construction. General guidelines will be developed to ensure proper location of&#13;
ancillary facilities on the school site, as well as to provide for future expansion. School sites will&#13;
be inspected and surveyed in advance to assess suitability (access, terrain, soil conditions, water&#13;
availability, and other critical factors) and cost for site improvements. Facilities maintenance&#13;
will be budgeted at 1.5 percent of capital costs annually; and resources (in cash or kind) will&#13;
have to be made available. In collaboration with communities and districts, MOE will prepare&#13;
draft facilities maintenance policy and operational guidelines (types of maintenance, financial&#13;
responsibilities, modalities of execution).&#13;
3.21   Increasing Girls' Participation.  The FCUBE program  seeks to enhance girls'&#13;
education through targeted interventions. Several initiatives will be undertaken at the outset.&#13;
First, a pilot study using participatory learning assessment (PLA) techniques will be conducted&#13;
in selected districts to identify the constraints to girls' participation in schools and develop&#13;
effective programs to remove such constraints. Secondly, gender experts will review the current&#13;
curriculum and existing textbooks to ensure gender sensitivity in content and illustrations, and&#13;
will continue to be involved in all phases of curriculum development. Field tests of new&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
materials will be analyzed by gender as well as other criteria. Thirdly, a study on scholarship&#13;
programs will be undertaken to assess the impact of award/scholarship schemes that have been&#13;
implemented in Ghana and in similar situations, and to recommend an action plan for providing&#13;
various forms of financial assistance to encourage girls (and possibly other low participation&#13;
groups) to attend school. Fourthly, plans will be developed to promote science and mathematics&#13;
education for girls, taking into consideration the Science, Technology and Mathematics&#13;
Education (STME) Program and adapting it to the basic level. Pending the outcome of these&#13;
efforts, a long term strategy for enhancing girls' participation in education will be formulated,&#13;
together with implementation plans for various forms of interventions. At the same time pre-&#13;
service and in-service training will seek to raise awareness in teachers of gender issues, and&#13;
efforts will be made to recruit more female teachers into the profession. Districts will be asked&#13;
to identify qualified female candidates for service in their localities, and special training&#13;
programs will be organized for such candidates in remote areas to help them attain the necessary&#13;
minimum skill levels.&#13;
3.22   Fostering Community Involvement. MOE recognizes the importance of community&#13;
and parental involvement in schooling in improving the teaching and learning environment.&#13;
Communities have an important role to play in enforcing standards, developing and maintaining&#13;
school property, and providing support and encouragement to headteachers, teachers and&#13;
students.  The ultimate goal is to develop community ownership, pride and sense of&#13;
responsibility for schools.  MOE will promote community involvement in education by&#13;
strengthening SMCs, devising mechanisms for consultation with DEOCs to ensure the equitable&#13;
allocation of resources across basic education, and establishing a system for stakeholder&#13;
consultation to provide feedback on progress towards program goals. Much of these efforts will&#13;
be undertaken as part of improving management efficiency under Component 2. Special&#13;
programs to foster community involvement will be initiated under this Component, including a&#13;
Schooling Improvement Fund (SIF) and an Information, Education and Communication (IEC)&#13;
campaign.&#13;
3.23   Schooling Improvement Fund (SIF).  In order to bring quality improvements to&#13;
schooling on a broad basis, MOE realizes that further efforts are needed to motivate communities&#13;
to become more involved in the delivery of education and take initiatives to manage and&#13;
contribute to school activities. The SIF is a flexible approach aimed at responding adequately&#13;
and promptly to the specific needs of particular school communities and encouraging initiatives&#13;
to improve the quality of teaching and learning. Instead of making uniform provision for all&#13;
schools throughout the country, the SIF will support specific requests from local communities&#13;
themselves. In this way communities will be involved in modest development projects from the&#13;
beginning, and therefore are likely to feel ownership of these projects and be committed to&#13;
sustaining them. A SIF pilot scheme will begin initially in three districts in 1996 under the&#13;
ongoing PSDP, based on the SIF Operational Manual discussed and agreed with IDA. The&#13;
Manual provides detailed guidelines for the selection criteria for school-based projects, the&#13;
ceiling for funding such projects, the procedures for project preparation, appraisal, approval and&#13;
implementation, as well as the draft terms of reference for NGO(s) to facilitate the&#13;
implementation of the pilot scheme. District Assemblies will be empowered to appraise and&#13;
approve funding requests from the schools. NGOs will be used to facilitate the process and to&#13;
build local capacity for project design, preparation, appraisal, and implementation. Based on the&#13;
experience of the pilot to be evaluated in mid-1997, the SIF will be gradually expanded to an&#13;
increasing number of districts. Depending on the pace at which districts and communities are&#13;
able to develop their capacity to manage the process and implement the school-based projects,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
the size of the SIF is estimated to increase from $325,000 in 1996 to possibly US$1 million in&#13;
1997 under the PSDP, and may further increase under BESIC. There are similaries in approach&#13;
between the SIF scheme and the school-based activities supported by ODA, USAID and&#13;
UNICEF (para. 2.50 and 3.3), and it would be useful to explore the lessons that could be learned&#13;
from each of these programs.&#13;
3.24   Information, Education and Communication (IEC). Much more effort needs to be&#13;
made to raise awareness among communities of the need for them to be involved, and for their&#13;
children to take part, in basic education. In particular, it is necessary to promote understanding&#13;
of the social and economic benefits of educating girls and to persuade people of the intrinsic&#13;
worth of basic education, independent of economic returns.   MOE  will work with&#13;
communications specialists and NGOs to develop an IEC strategy and prepare a plan for&#13;
implementation. The plan will identify the specific issues that need to be addressed, the attitudes&#13;
and behaviors that need to be changed, the target groups most crucial to effecting such changes,&#13;
the essential messages that need to be conveyed to particular groups, the most effective means of&#13;
delivering these messages, the relative timing of each activity, and the costs. The plan will also&#13;
include mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating the impact of the activities so that appropriate&#13;
and timely adjustments can be made to the IEC strategy and its implementation.&#13;
C. PROGRAM COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
Program Costs&#13;
3.25   The Government has declared that FCUBE is Ghana's only basic education program. All&#13;
ongoing and planned activities in basic education, whether financed solely from the&#13;
government's own resources or with the assistance of donors, will be coordinated under the&#13;
FCUBE program. Adherence to a common Operational Rolling Plan by the various supporting&#13;
agencies is thus ensured.&#13;
3.26   The total cost of the first phase of the FCUBE program (1996-2000) is currently&#13;
estimated to be about US$1.35 billion. This includes all recurrent and development costs at&#13;
central, regional, district, circuit, school and household levels, except the direct costs of privately&#13;
provided schooling. A summary of the total program costs is shown in Table 3-1 below. The&#13;
major activities under the three components of the FCUBE program (as described in para. 3.2-&#13;
3.24), which will be called "Betterment Activities", are estimated to cost about US$241.6&#13;
million, or 18 percent of the total cost of the program. Other costs of the basic education sector&#13;
over the first phase of the FCUBE program, including the projected costs of administration,&#13;
teachers' salaries, school operation and maintenance, as well as household spending and ongoing&#13;
donor-supported projects, are estimated to be about US$1.1 billion, or 82 percent of the total&#13;
cost. The overall costs of the FCUBE program will be reviewed annually as part of the joint&#13;
MOE/donor review of the FCUBE implementation plan, and will be adjusted by the MOE as&#13;
appropriate.&#13;
3.27   Of the current estimates of the total costs of the "Betterment Activities", Component I&#13;
(Enhanced Quality of Teaching and Learning) will absorb about 59 percent, Component 2&#13;
(Management for Efficiency) about 13 percent, and Component 3 (Improving Access and&#13;
Participation) about 28 percent. The composition of the costs of these three components are&#13;
summarized in Table 3-2 below.&#13;

Source: MOE and Bank staff estimates.&#13;
3.28   The bulk of other basic education sector costs consists of teachers' salaries, estimated at&#13;
about 82 percent of total other costs. Administration and support takes up about 7 percent and&#13;
school operation and maintenance about 3 percent, while private (household) spending on&#13;
education is about 22 percent, and ongoing donor-supported projects in basic education 3.5&#13;
percent. Administrative costs. including both salary and non-salary items, will be limited to a&#13;
fixed proportion of teachers' salaries over the FCUBE program period, with increased spending&#13;
at the school level. The share of the total wage bill in total program costs is estimated to average&#13;
around 50 percent over the program period. absorbing almost 84 percent of the annual MOE&#13;
budget. The average salary for basic education teachers is estimated to increase in real terms by&#13;
two percent annually, allowing for relocation and severance payouts and for incentives to&#13;
motivate teachers to improve their performance. Household contributions will continue to pay&#13;
for day-to-day outlays on transportation, meals, uniform, stationery and the like, as well as&#13;
augment district capacity in the provision and maintenance of school facilities.&#13;
3.29   Ongoing donor-supported projects in basic education include IDA's PSDP (Cr. 2508-&#13;
GH), USAID's PREP, and other activities supported by ODA and UNICEF. These operations&#13;
will continue under their original design or are being restructured to fit in with the overall&#13;
FCUBE program as appropriate.&#13;

Program Financing&#13;
3.30   During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government on the proposed&#13;
sector financing plan for the first phase of FCUBE (1996-2000), as shown in Table 3-3. The&#13;
Government of Ghana (MOE and Districts) will be the largest financial contributor (about 64&#13;
percent of total program costs) to the provision of basic education, both in recurrent and&#13;
development activities. Contribution from the Government and communities (together&#13;
accounting for 83 percent of total program costs) will pay for the costs of teachers' salaries and&#13;
administration and an increasing share of non-salary recurrent costs. It will also bear an&#13;
increasing share of the sector's capital costs through budgetary transfers to the DACF.&#13;
Government and community financing capacity over the period 1996-2000 is estimated to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
about US$1.1 billion. This implies a total financing need of about US$230 million for the&#13;
period, to be met by contributions from a number of donor agencies which have indicated&#13;
interest in the program. About US$54 million will be met by resources already available under&#13;
ongoing donor-supported projects, including US$1.5 million recently committed by the&#13;
UNICEF. Additional financing will be provided by IDA under the BESIC (US$50 million),&#13;
ODA(UK) (US$23 million equivalent), USAID (US$53 million) and KfW/GTZ (US$25 million&#13;
equivalent). It is expected that other donors (including the European Union, Japan, Norway and&#13;
the African Development Bank) will come on stream to fill the gap of about US$25 million.&#13;
3.31   Donor support. Donor agencies which have been active participants in the preparation&#13;
stage of this program have expressed interest in supporting its implementation. USAID is&#13;
considering continuing its support for primary education through the provision of assistance&#13;
targeted at pupil performance and school management improvement in a designated number of&#13;
schools. KfW/GTZ (Germany) are preparing to assist in the rehabilitation of TTCs and possibly&#13;
other aspects of institutional support. This will complement ODA (U.K.)'s long-standing&#13;
interest in the professional training and continuing education of teachers, which it proposes to&#13;
continue with increasing focus on school-based training. UNICEF's experience in community-&#13;
based education activities will also continue, along with its programmed support for&#13;
strengthening policy and planning, rural girls' access to education and early childhood&#13;
development. Norway is interested in contributing to gender equity initiatives. The European&#13;
Union (EU) has been providing some 50 percent of MOE's non-salary recurrent budget on a&#13;
matching basis. This will continue through 1996, after which EU will consider an appropriate&#13;
form of future support. The Governments of Japan and Norway, and the African Development&#13;
Bank are among other external donor agencies likely to commit their support based on the&#13;
common framework for FCUBE.&#13;
3.32   Activities Financed by the Proposed IDA Credit (BESIC). The proposed IDA Credit&#13;
of US$50.0 million equivalent will support in-service training of educational personnel,&#13;
provision of instructional materials to schools, training and workshops for MOE/GES, DEOs and&#13;
SMCs to improve efficiency in management, rehabilitation and construction of school facilities&#13;
to improve access and the teaching/learning environment, and initiatives to encourage girls'&#13;
participation and community involvement in education and schooling activities. The level of&#13;
IDA financing of specific items and activities will be reviewed annually as part of the&#13;
government/donor review process (para. 4.13).&#13;
Program sustainability&#13;
3.33   Recurrent Cost Implications. Implementing FCUBE will have an impact both on the&#13;
ongoing and betterment activities. Preliminary estimates suggest that, except for an increasing&#13;
demand for the supply of instructional materials, the costs of continuing the betterment activities&#13;
of the FCUBE program in the second phase (2001-2005) will be significantly lowes, about 40&#13;
percent of the costs during the first phase. The average rate of growth of teachers' wage bill is&#13;
projected to be slightly lowered -- from 4.9 percent in the first phase to 4.7 percent in the second&#13;
phase.  MOE will regularly monitor the recurrent cost implications during program&#13;
implementation. The simulation model developed for the FCUBE will be used to analyze&#13;
different scenarios to cope with any deviations from the base scenario. Adjustments will be&#13;
made if necessary to the composition and structure of the program in the annual joint&#13;
donor/MOE reviews, based on agreed performance indicators.&#13;

-Reflecting the undisbursed balance as of January 1, 1996, of which about US$20 million will support some of&#13;
the "Betterment Activities' of the FCUBE program consistent with the objectives of the PSDP project, and the&#13;
rest will continue to support ongoing activities in basic education.&#13;
L The European Union, Japan and Norway are expected to support the program and contribute to fill the gap.&#13;
3.34    The Government's commitment to FCUBE is solid. In its Letter of Basic Education&#13;
Sector Development Policy, the Government states that it will sustain the current budgetary&#13;
commitment to the basic education sector and increase non-salary recurrent outlays annually by&#13;
an agreed percent in real terms for the duration of FCUBE. The Letter also affirms that&#13;
MOE/GES has the authority to deploy personnel and financial resources within the education&#13;
sector, and is fully accountable for the proper management of these resources. To gain national&#13;
consensus and support, MOE/GES has been, and will continue, consulting with parliamentary&#13;
members, other ministries (in particular MOF, MLGRD and OHCS), regional and district GES&#13;
staff, district authorities, and school and community representatives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
3.35   The FCUBE program is based on the understanding that quality improvement is essential&#13;
to obtain parental support and hence enrollment growth. In turn, community participation will&#13;
contribute to the improvement of teaching/learning outcomes.&#13;
3.36   Financial Sustainability. The program is designed to attain its objectives within the&#13;
agreed financial framework, which requires the government to maintain its present level of fiscal&#13;
commitment to basic education. Quality basic education needs minimum essential inputs to be&#13;
in place at the school level. As for the subsectoral salary envelope, MOE's budget allocation&#13;
needs to allow for a modest pace of growth to accommodate system expansion and rewards for&#13;
excellent performance while at the same time ensuring that the share of spending on non-salary&#13;
items increases over time. The Government's policy decision to increase non-salary expenditure&#13;
by 10 percent annually in real terms will make the budget structure more robust and efficient in&#13;
contributing to the improved service. The share of teacher salary expenditure within the MOE&#13;
recurrent budget will gradually decline over the program period, keeping the compound effect of&#13;
annual increase in the number of teachers and their average salary below the projected pace of&#13;
annual MOE budget increases (see Annex 3-4).&#13;
3.37   For capital spending - the responsibility principally of district authorities - an increased&#13;
transfer of funds from the central government will be essential, especially for those districts with&#13;
severely limited resource mobilizing capacity. The DACF, for which the Government is&#13;
mandated to secure 5 percent of national tax revenues, is the only central transfer for most&#13;
districts. If the financing gap for capital expenditure is to narrow appreciably, spending on basic&#13;
education infrastructure will need to increase annually by 20 percent on average in real terms.&#13;
This implies that by the year 2005, average DACF spending on basic education will need to&#13;
reach 40 percent.&#13;
4. PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. PROGRAM PREPARATION&#13;
4.1    MOE-Coordinated Preparation. A joint MOE-donor forum was set up in August 1994&#13;
to facilitate preparation of a sector-wide program to support the FCUBE objectives within a ten-&#13;
year time frame. USAID, ODA, EU, UNICEF and the Bank have been active members of the&#13;
forum.  KfW/GTZ and JICA are also keenly interested in the sector. Sector analyses were&#13;
carried out jointly by government and donor teams. The key issues were discussed in a series of&#13;
workshops involving staff in relevant departments of the MOE, specialists from Ghanaian&#13;
universities and research institutions, as well as representatives from donor agencies. The results&#13;
of the analytical work and discussions have been incorporated into the FCUBE program&#13;
documents prepared by the MOE. It has been agreed among MOE and donors that the FCUBE&#13;
program will cover the entire basic education (primary and junior secondary) subsector and will&#13;
include all ongoing and planned activities. The program will be implemented within a strategic&#13;
framework and an operational rolling plan. All support for basic education must be offered&#13;
within these parameters. BESIC will be IDA's contribution to FCUBE for the four year period&#13;
1997-2000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
4.2   Participatory Approach. Local stakeholders and beneficiaries will take the lead in the&#13;
implementation of FCUBE, while donors will provide technical support and financial assistance.&#13;
A sense of local ownership and commitment to the program will continue to be ensured through&#13;
systematic client consultation and consensus building, and through specific program activities&#13;
designed to encourage active community participation in education and school management.&#13;
B. PROGRAM MANAGEMENT AND COORDINATION&#13;
4.3    Since the FCUBE is a sector-wide program for basic education, implementation will&#13;
represent a major part of the regular work of the MOE/GES over the next 10 years, and will&#13;
require the active involvement of all operational and support divisions within MOE/GES.&#13;
Program management and implementation responsibility, therefore, will be vested in the&#13;
mainstream management structures of the MOE/GES. The Minister and top management of&#13;
MOE/GES will be ultimately responsible for the achievement of the goals of the FCUBE&#13;
program, and will draw upon the expertise of a Senior Management Team comprised of heads of&#13;
divisions. This management team will review progress against key indicators annually, review&#13;
and approve the annual program at the beginning of each year and monitor progress quarterly.&#13;
The Special Assistant to the Minister on FCUBE will facilitate the transition from a conventional&#13;
"project" model to the "integrated sector program" approach described in paragraphs 4.4 - 4.6&#13;
below.&#13;
4.4   The governance for the program will be provided by an Implementation Overview&#13;
Committee (IOC) which will be answerable to the Minister of Education and on which major&#13;
stakeholders will be represented. The IOC will meet regularly to coordinate the various reform&#13;
and decentralization initiatives, both within the education sector and in the broader public sector.&#13;
The IOC, comprising members drawn from the MOE/GES Management, MOF, MLGRD, NIRP,&#13;
CSPIP and GNAT, will be set up prior to Board presentation. A Consultative Panel, chaired by&#13;
the Minister of Education and consisting of selected members of the IOC and participating donor&#13;
representatives, will review past and proposed uses of resources under the FCUBE program. The&#13;
Panel will meet on a six-monthly basis, with a July/August meeting constituting the major annual&#13;
review.&#13;
4.5    Day-to-day administration of each component of the FCUBE program will require the&#13;
contribution of functional specialists (e.g. in training, curriculum, personnel, logistics) drawn&#13;
from  different divisions and units of the GES.  Special organization and management&#13;
arrangements will be introduced to ensure that program activities are well coordinated. With this&#13;
in view, the MOE has already appointed a Deputy Director-General of the GES as the FCUBE&#13;
Coordinator. His overall role will be to coordinate the work of functional specialists around the&#13;
needs of individual components and to participate in the quarterly program reviews conducted by&#13;
the Senior Management Team. The Coordinator will have the authority to review annual&#13;
component and sub-component work plans, to operate systems of control, to convene monthly&#13;
progress review meetings and to negotiate changes in staffing, schedules and work plans as&#13;
necessary. The staff involved in implementation would be identified by their managers to work&#13;
on specific program activities. Nonetheless, they would retain allegiance to their mainstream&#13;
division which would retain authority for their professional development, promotion, discipline&#13;
and appraisal of technical competence. This arrangement will enable the Coordinator to use&#13;
fully the technical capacity of existing GES divisions and units. The outline management&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
structure for the FCUBE program which reflects these organizing principles is set out in Annex&#13;
7.&#13;
4.6    Because of the complexity and size of the program, the Coordinator will be supported by&#13;
a core group of staff in the FCUBE Secretariat. The initial composition and staffing of the&#13;
FCUBE Secretariat was discussed during negotiations and staff appointments are expected to be&#13;
made within the next few months.&#13;
4.7    Under these strengthened management arrangements, the Project Management Unit&#13;
(PMU) will provide technical services in procurement, accounting and disbursement, especially&#13;
as these relate to the "banking business" relations with IDA and other donors. In line with this&#13;
revised role, a joint Government/donor review of the staffing in the PMU will be undertaken, to&#13;
ensure that adequate technical support will be provided to the management of the FCUBE&#13;
program at both the headquarters and district levels.&#13;
4.8    The FCUBE program will provide the overall basis for the coordination of donor activity&#13;
and support for basic education. Since the FCUBE Secretariat has the full knowledge of FCUBE&#13;
component and sub-component plans and their associated resource requirements, it will also be&#13;
the focal point for mobilizing donor support. The Coordinator and his staff will, with support&#13;
from the Special Assistant to the Minister on FCUBE, liaise with donors on new funding to meet&#13;
identified resource gaps as well as provide regular reports on ongoing support. These reports&#13;
would contain information on procurement status and financial disbursement generated by the&#13;
reconstituted PMU.&#13;
4.9    District Directors of Education will remain answerable directly to the GES Director-&#13;
General for the achievement of identified program indicators which relate to FCUBE.  As&#13;
decentralization proceeds, the DEOs will be strengthened to carry out their assigned&#13;
responsibilities for supervising schools, providing support to in-service teacher education and&#13;
assessing pupil-teacher performance. Since these responsibilities constitute core activities in the&#13;
FCUBE program, they will also need to be programmed in accordance with its objectives and&#13;
priorities. Accordingly, District Directors of Education will set objectives and prepare detailed&#13;
annual plans and budgets, which will be reviewed by the Regional Education Offices acting on&#13;
behalf of the headquarters of the GES. They will also need to coordinate this work with the&#13;
District Assemblies, which are legally mandated to oversee all schools within their jurisdiction.&#13;
Headteachers and SMCs will be consulted on their priorities during plan and budget preparation&#13;
at the district level.&#13;
C. PROGRAM MONITORING, REPORTING AND SUPERVISION&#13;
4.10   Since the FCUBE is a sector program  for which the mainstream  MOE/GES is&#13;
responsible, the monitoring and reporting arrangements for donors and other key stakeholders&#13;
will be a subset of those which the MOE/GES requires for its internal management purposes.&#13;
Monitoring will examine achievement and progress in relation to the identified program success&#13;
indicators, component and sub-component performance indicators, and activity plans which&#13;
would be made publicly available. It would, therefore, take place at a number of different&#13;
management levels from headquarters to the school level. For instance, SMCs would be&#13;
involved in monitoring teacher/pupil attendance and school achievement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
4.11   Under  the  management  component,  strengthened  procedures  for  reviewing&#13;
divisional/unit work plans would be developed and improved management information systems&#13;
introduced to support the monitoring requirements at all levels of management. In addition, the&#13;
introduction of more efficient management structures will ensure that relevant information is&#13;
transmitted directly from district to headquarters level.&#13;
4.12   A regular program planning and monitoring cycle would be established for FCUBE&#13;
linked to the Government's budget preparation process as well as plans for the rest of the&#13;
education sector. During the year,  those organizational units and individuals assigned&#13;
responsibility for implementing specific FCUBE sub-components and activities (e.g. in-service&#13;
training, classroom construction, staff redeployment) would submit regular progress reports to&#13;
the FCUBE Secretariat. As appropriate, these reports would also include information on district-&#13;
based activities. The FCUBE Coordinator and his staff will take into account the implications of&#13;
these reports in updating the implementation plans. These report updates would, therefore,&#13;
provide the basis for senior management's review of implementation progress against key&#13;
performance indicators in the Operational Plan. The decisions taken at this review would be&#13;
used as a basis for preparation of materials for reviews by the Consultative Panel (para. 4.4).&#13;
4.13   During negotiations, it was agreed that there would be semi-annual review meetings&#13;
convened by the Government with the Consultative Panel, in January/February and June/July&#13;
each year. The January/February meeting will focus mainly on the overall program performance&#13;
in the preceding year based on the progress report updates (para. 4.12). Constraints to effective&#13;
program implementation will be identified and amendments to the Operational Rolling Plan will&#13;
be made as necessary. The June/July meeting will focus on forward planning and financial&#13;
commitments for the coming year, drawing upon discussions in the January/February meeting&#13;
and implementation performance in the subsequent months. The June/July 1998 meeting will&#13;
constitute a mid-term review of the program. Donors and other stakeholders will be provided&#13;
progress report updates at least one month prior to each review meeting, and will receive, prior&#13;
to the end of September each year, a draft forward implementation plan and budget. This plan&#13;
and budget should reflect all costs and sources of financing for the entire education sector, in&#13;
particular the basic education subsector, and should include specific measures to ensure that&#13;
adequate resources will be allocated at the district level for the provision and maintenance of&#13;
school facilities.&#13;
D. PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.14   IDA-financed activities will fully follow IDA Procurement Guidelines (January 1995&#13;
edition). The procurement methods are described below and summarized in Table 4-1. A&#13;
summary procurement schedule for key activities has been prepared (Annex 5-5) and a much&#13;
more detailed schedule will be included in the Operational Rolling Plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
4.15   Civil works: (BESIC supports US$13.6 million equivalent).  Civil works financed&#13;
under IDA include: rehabilitation of existing school facilities, new classrooms, and housing for&#13;
teachers. Contracts will be packaged in lots of at least US$2 million equivalent to attract&#13;
international competition under ICB. Lots that cannot be grouped into such bid packages and/or&#13;
are unlikely to attract competition from foreign bidders will be procured through National&#13;
Competitive Bidding (NCB), up to an aggregate of US$8.4 million equivalent. A number of&#13;
contracts which will require labor intensive manpower and/or use of NGOs and local labor may&#13;
be procured in accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA.  These are mostly small&#13;
construction (works such as toilet facilities and storage) and rehabilitation works valued at&#13;
US$100,000 equivalent or less per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$1.4&#13;
million.&#13;
4.16   Goods. (BESIC supports US$10.1 million equivalent). Goods financed under IDA&#13;
would include mainly roofing materials for classrooms, instructional materials, vehicles and&#13;
miscellaneous equipment (e.g., computer systems and other equipment for education offices and&#13;
school workshops). Goods valued at US$250,000 or more per contract would be procured&#13;
through ICB using the Bank's standard bidding documents. Goods which can be competitively&#13;
procured nationally and which cannot be grouped into bid packages of at least US$250,000&#13;
equivalent each will be procured through NCB under procedures acceptable to Bank. In&#13;
aggregate these will not exceed US$4.0 million equivalent. Small items and goods which cannot&#13;
be grouped into bid packages of at least US$50,000 equivalent will be procured on the basis of&#13;
price quotations (National Shopping) obtained from at least three reliable suppliers, provided&#13;
that the aggregate amount of such procurement does not exceed a total of US$1.2 million&#13;
equivalent. Limited International Bidding (LIB) may be used for the procurement of specialized&#13;
educational goods such as didactic material, software and equipment, for which there is only a&#13;
limited number of suppliers to justify open advertisement for the contract. Bids for contracts&#13;
estimated to cost less than US$250,000 equivalent, up to an aggregate amount not exceeding&#13;
US$500,000 equivelent, will be sought from a list of potential suppliers. Proprietary educational&#13;
software, spare parts and other small items which are costing US$400,000 equivalent or less in&#13;
the aggregate, may, with IDA's prior agreement, be procured by direct contracting in accordance&#13;
with IDA procedures. Local practices for NCB have been recently reviewed by IDA and found&#13;
acceptable. They will include: (a) explicit statement to bidders of the evaluation and award&#13;
criteria; (b) local advertising with public bid opening; (c) award to lowest evaluated bidder; and&#13;
(d) foreign bidders would not be precluded from participating in NCB. Government has&#13;
confirmed the above NCB principles.&#13;
4.17   Services: (BESIC supports US$2.2 million equivalent). Consultants financed by IDA&#13;
will be contracted in accordance with IDA's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (August&#13;
1981).  The consultancy services required under the project will be mostly for project&#13;
implementation and supervision, surveys and research studies and for architectural and&#13;
engineering services. Draft terms of reference for major consulting services have been prepared&#13;
and details are included in the Operational Rolling Plan.&#13;

Notes:    Not financed under the proposed IDA Credit for BESIC. However, the ongoing Primary School&#13;
Development Project (Cr. 2508-GH) will finance some of the Betterment Activities in the FCUBE&#13;
Program which are consistent with its objectives, and will use ICB/LIB or other procurement&#13;
methods as appropriate.&#13;
Aggregates for direct contracting of goods are included under the "Other column."&#13;
Includes costs associated with the redeployment of MOE/GES staff, and incremental expenditures&#13;
incurred for the carrying out of the Project for travel allowances, office communication, minor&#13;
office equipment and supplies, utilities, fuel, vehicle and equipment maintenance.&#13;
ld Includes in-service training of education personnel (teachers, headteachers, circuit supervisors,&#13;
district education officers, education planning and budgeting officers at MOE headquarters and&#13;
districts, etc.) to improve pedagogical and management skills; training for members of SMCs,&#13;
district assemblies, etc. to strengthen school-level management; training for all levels of education&#13;
administration to adapt to changes in the process of decentralization; some overseas training for&#13;
specific technical skills in data management and policy planning, etc.&#13;
Mainly activities that may be included under the Schooling Improvement Fund (para. 3.23).&#13;
4.18    Procurement Arrangements. Procurement management and execution will be closely&#13;
monitored by IDA. Construction works will be supervised by experienced project engineers or&#13;
technical specialists financed by IDA. For school construction, rehabilitation and small works&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
payment will be made to contractors only when the work is completed according to&#13;
specifications. Only for major works will mobilization advance be given and this will not&#13;
exceed 20 percent of the contract value. Procurement will be carried out by experienced staff of&#13;
the procurement section of the PMU which will liaise with the MOE/GES units for handling all&#13;
matters related to the preparation, implementation and monitoring of work plans for the smooth&#13;
execution of procurement of all works, goods, and services, including the preparation of bidding&#13;
documents, launching of tenders, evaluation, and reporting the results to the government and to&#13;
IDA for review. During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government on adherence&#13;
to the schedule for key procurement steps in Table 4-2, in order to expedite project&#13;
implementation.&#13;

Consulting services             30 days                    30 days&#13;
4.19   In addition, adequate records on procurement progress, including staff reports on site&#13;
visits, the timing of works and goods procurement, and compliance with agreed methods of&#13;
procurement will be maintained by the PMU and will be reviewed as part of the routine project&#13;
monitoring by the MOE.&#13;
4.20   A project launch workshop will be organized by the Government and IDA shortly after&#13;
Board presentation with the assistance of PMU staff. This workshop will be attended by staff&#13;
from all project entities, deal with all aspects of project implementation, and especially&#13;
concentrate on procurement, disbursement, monitoring, and reporting. A final version of the&#13;
Opertional Plan of the FCUBE program will be circulated at the launch workshop.&#13;
4.21   Bank Review. Prior review by IDA would be required for procurement of packages of&#13;
works and goods which exceed US$250,000, of consultant services to firms of US$100,000, and&#13;
to individuals of US$50,000. All terms of reference for consultants, sole source consultancies,&#13;
assignments of critical nature, and amendments to consultants contracts raising the contract&#13;
value above the aforementioned amounts will be subject to IDA's prior review. Post review of&#13;
procurement actions will be given special care by IDA and will include, as additional to Bank&#13;
supervision missions, selected review by Third Party verificiation firms. The Bank's Standard&#13;
Bidding Documents will be used for works and goods procured under ICB and for consultants.&#13;
NCB documents for works and goods will be cleared with IDA as part of the Operational Plan.&#13;
&#13;

E. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
4.22   The activities financed under the proposed credit are expected to be completed within&#13;
four and a half years by December 31, 2000, with all disbursements made by June 30, 2001. The&#13;
estimated disbursement schedule is given in Annex 5-5.&#13;
4.23   Table 4-3 gives the categories and amounts to be financed out of the proposed IDA&#13;
credit, and the disbursement percentages in each category.&#13;

Note: / See Table 4-1, footnote /c.&#13;
4.24   Special Account.  To facilitate project implementation and reduce the volume of&#13;
withdrawal applications, a Special Account will be opened in US Dollars in a commercial bank&#13;
on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. The authorized allocation amounts to US$2.5&#13;
million and covers about four months of eligible expenditures. Upon effectiveness, an amount of&#13;
$1,250,000, representing 50 percent of the authorized allocation, will be deposited in the Special&#13;
Account. The remaining balance will be made available when the total amount withdrawn from the&#13;
credit account and/or special commitments issued amount to SDR 5.0 million. The Special&#13;
Account will be used for all payments below US$500,000. Replenishments would be submitted&#13;
monthly.  All replenishments are fully documented except for:  (a) contracts of less than&#13;
US$250,000 for civil works and goods, (b) contracts of less than US$100,000 for consulting&#13;
services - firms, (c) US$50,000 for consulting services - individuals, and (d) operational costs&#13;
which would be claimed on the basis of Statements of Expenditure (SOEs). All supporting&#13;
documentation for SOEs will be retained for review by periodic Bank supervision missions and&#13;
external auditors. Overall responsibility for credit disbursement and financial management of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
Special Account will rest with the PMU. All disbursements are subject to the conditions of the&#13;
Development Credit Agreement and the procedures defined in the Disbursement Letter.&#13;
F. AccoUNTING, AUDITING, AND REPORTING&#13;
4.25   MOE/GES Accounts. Systems will be installed to ensure compatibility between the&#13;
accounting for Government receipts for and outlays in basic education, from all sources. Given&#13;
that BESIC is an across-the-board underpinning to the FCUBE program, the Government will&#13;
make available to IDA, on a regular basis, financial management details of the consolidated&#13;
Program Accounts for the education sector as a whole, so that a "part-whole" appreciation of&#13;
trends can be maintained.&#13;
4.26  In the interests of transparency and financial harmony, all accounts of the entire basic&#13;
education sector (notwithstanding the source of funds) will be maintained by a commonly agreed&#13;
method and at internationally accepted standards. By June 30 of each year, MOE/GES will&#13;
present to IDA and other participating donors in FCUBE an independent auditor's report&#13;
(management report and audited financial statements) for all program accounts - including those&#13;
for Government funds, BESIC and other donor contributions from the preceding&#13;
academic/calendar year.&#13;
4.27   Following previous routine audits, IDA has raised concerns about aspects of the financial&#13;
management and cash flow of existing education projects. The recommendations made during&#13;
the course of these financial audits have been helpful to MOE and will be incorporated into the&#13;
management of the planned program. The MOE will also move progressively from a line item&#13;
budget to a program budget during this initiative. This shift should result in more discretionary&#13;
funds being available within the overall MOE/GES budget. Financial management workshops&#13;
are planned for District Directors of Education and accounting personnel, with training to be&#13;
provided on guidelines stemming from the audit recommendations. Shortlisting of independent&#13;
auditors for FCUBEIBESIC, under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA will be a condition&#13;
of Credit effectiveness.&#13;
G. PROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
Program Benefits&#13;
4.28   Improved Basic Education Sector Outcomes. The quality of Ghana's basic education&#13;
will improve in general. especially in terms of better teaching/learning outcomes. Government/&#13;
donor/community cooperation and collaboration will be enhanced, and some more common&#13;
procedures will be developed, because of the "holistic" nature of the Integrated sector approach&#13;
(SIP) approach. The MOE's capacity to plan, manage, and monitor a range of complementary&#13;
inputs to enhance quality and access will be strengthened. The GES will adopt new systems of&#13;
assessing school performance and rewarding/sanctioning staff. Capacity for more effective&#13;
curriculum  utilization will be enhanced.  Pre- and in-service teacher education will be&#13;
revolutionized. The operation of the whole system, including individual schools, will become&#13;
more gender sensitive. Communities will come to play a more influential and responsible role in&#13;
the management of the schools, leading to greater school effectiveness. The synergistic effect of&#13;
the various components will increase net impact.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
4.29   Gains from Improved Efficiency. FCUBE/BESIC will produce efficiency gains both&#13;
at management and school levels. Review and reorganization of the MOE and GES institutional&#13;
structure, while developing an effective EMIS, will substantially reduce the waste and&#13;
duplication in resource use. This will enable MOE to reallocate more resources to much needed&#13;
schooling improvement activities. At the school level, reduction in dropout and repetition rates&#13;
by 10 percent annually, together with efforts to raise the PI intake rate from the present 82&#13;
percent to 94 percent by the year 2000, will allow 164,000 more pupils to study at public primary&#13;
schools and produce 33,000 more public JSS graduates during 1996-2000 than would be the case&#13;
without FCUBE.&#13;
4.30   Impact on the Poor and Girls Participation. A community with inadequate basic&#13;
education services and with low school learning outcome generally has a low demand for&#13;
education. FCUBE/BESIC has policy and program components to target funds to the poorest and&#13;
educationally most disadvantageous communities, and to raise awareness of the need and&#13;
benefits of education in such communities. The DACF is allocated by the Government having&#13;
regard to poverty, equity and needs criteria.  To complement this, FCUBE will target&#13;
supplementary  resources.  For example, when new schools are built with MOE subsidies,&#13;
priority will be given to relatively poor communities with lower enrollment, especially girls&#13;
participation, where financial capacity is low but the effort being made is fair. Teacher housing&#13;
will be available with subsidized rent in areas where incentives for teachers to serve are adverse.&#13;
JSS pupils or their families who are judged by a transparent process to be needy may receive&#13;
some public financial support during their period of basic schooling. These combined with a&#13;
demand-stimulating IEC campaign will enable more girls and poor children to go to school who&#13;
otherwise would not benefit from Ghana's basic education service.&#13;
4.31   Economic benefits of investment in basic education. The economic benefits of this&#13;
basic education improvement program can be expressed by the rates of return to investment in&#13;
education. Based on 1992 household survey data in Ghana, the private rate of return to&#13;
investment in primary education compared with no education is estimated at 28 percent,&#13;
suggesting that if $1,000 is invested in primary education, there will be an annual private benefit&#13;
of about $280 over the lifetime of the average primary school graduate, above what the same&#13;
person would have earned without attending school. Similarly, the social rate of return to&#13;
primary compared with no education has been found to be about 19 percent. The private rate of&#13;
return to secondary education over primary schooling is about 12 percent and the social rate of&#13;
return is 10 percent. The gap between private and social returns is explained by the public&#13;
subsidization of education. Subgroup analysis shows that at both primary and secondary levels,&#13;
girls in Ghana have a higher rate of return than boys, justifying targeted intervention to promote&#13;
more girls' participation. Further details on cost-benefit analyses shown in Annex 3-3 suggests&#13;
that investment for expansion of good quality basic education will have a high private and public&#13;
payoff.&#13;
4.32   With respect to the economic benefits of the quality of basic education, international&#13;
evidence suggests that the economic benefits of education are greater when a critical minimum&#13;
of education attainment across the population has been achieved. Cross-country macroeconomic&#13;
studies analyzed by the Bank have shown that the average educational attainment of the&#13;
population has a strong positive effect on economic growth, with one year of additional&#13;
schooling of the labor force possibly leading to as much as a 9 percent increase in the domestic&#13;
output for the first three years of schooling and to 4 percent a year for the next three years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
Program Risks&#13;
4.33   There are three main risks concerning the effectiveness of this operation. First, changing&#13;
teachers' attitudes towards working seriously will take time and thus quality improvements in&#13;
the classroom may not take place as rapidly as would be desirable. Second, the Government&#13;
could be overstretched in the early stages of the program as it manages simultaneously the full&#13;
range of necessary interventions in the basic school system. Third, despite the intervention&#13;
targeting the poor, parents in economically deprived and educationally backward districts may&#13;
still be unwilling to send their children to school because of high direct and indirect costs. The&#13;
first risk will be mitigated through a continuous participatory and consultative process during&#13;
which all parties will come to clearly understand their respective roles and responsibilities; and&#13;
the consequences of certain behavior. Furthermore, communities (through SMCs) will assume&#13;
some responsibility for recommending the rewarding or sanctioning of teachers. More effective&#13;
school level supervision and generating sense of partnership among all key players for improving&#13;
schooling also have crucial roles to play in this issue. The second risk will be minimized by&#13;
ensuring that the early years of the program focus on a manageable package of the highest&#13;
priority items; that the foreshadowed administrative restructuring and institutional strengthening&#13;
proceeds on schedule; and that ongoing Government/community/donor consultation becomes&#13;
firrmly embedded in the implementation process. For the third risk, Government/MOE will&#13;
develop special arrangements such as compensatory resource transfers to clusters of&#13;
disadvantaged schools. Further, as an experimental measure, non-conventional approaches to&#13;
basic education, with more flexible access and delivery arrangements and reduced cost impact on&#13;
families, will be introduced.&#13;
Poverty Category&#13;
4.34   Focusing on issues of quality, efficiency and equity, the proposed operation will&#13;
particularly benefit the less advantaged groups of the Ghanaian population: the urban and rural&#13;
poor; and girls. It would thus be included in the Program of Targeted Interventions.&#13;
Environmental Aspects&#13;
4.35   This operation will include limited small scale construction activities, none of which will&#13;
have significant negative environmental or social impacts. In conformity with OD 4.01, this is a&#13;
category C project requiring no further environmental analysis.&#13;
5.  AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
5.1    During negotiations, the Government reached agreement with IDA on:&#13;
(a)    a draft Letter of Basic Education Sector Development Policy, outlining the&#13;
Government's policy priorities, commitments and targets for the period 1996-&#13;
2005 (para. 3.1);&#13;
(b)    a draft Operational Rolling Plan, including key performance indicators, with&#13;
specific arrangements for activities to be carried out in 1996-98 (para. 3.2);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
(c)    a Sector Financing Plan reflecting all costs and sources of financing for the&#13;
education sector, in particular the basic education subsector (para. 3.30);&#13;
(d)   the management structure for the program, including the establishment of the&#13;
Implementation Overview Committee and the Consultative Panel involving&#13;
participating donor representatives (para. 4.3-4.9);&#13;
(e)    semi-annual review meetings in January/February and June/July each year,&#13;
convened by the Government with the Consultative Panel, with the June/July&#13;
1998 meeting constituting a Mid-Term Review (para. 4.13);&#13;
(f)    Government commitment to delegate, progressively from the beginning of 1998,&#13;
financial management discretion to designated districts having viable education&#13;
plans and administrative systems (para. 3.16);&#13;
(g)    draft terms of reference for key long-term and short-term consultants (para.&#13;

Cost-Benefit Analysis&#13;
Cost-Benefit Analysis: Returns to Education&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.     Of the several important investment decision criteria such as the Net Present Value&#13;
(NPV), the Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) and the Internal Rate of Return (IRR), each with its own&#13;
relative advantages and weaknesses, IRR has been extensively used for establishing education&#13;
investment priorities at the margin. It has been shown that in education projects in which the&#13;
net flow of benefit stream does not change very often, multiple rates of return rarely occur, and&#13;
IRR criterion gives the same answer as NPV. The present analysis is built around the&#13;
calculation of IRR from both private and social perspectives.&#13;
Benefits of Education: Age-Education-Earnings Profiles&#13;
2.     Measurement difficulties allow, among the innumerable education benefits, only the&#13;
direct monetary benefits associated with education to be brought into the cost-benefit analysis.&#13;
In the case of Ghana, the data set obtained from the 1992 Ghana Living Standards Survey&#13;
(GLSS3) can be used for the construction of age-education earnings profiles. It is assumed that&#13;
children in Ghana do not enter the labor force before age 9 and their working life ends by age 65.&#13;
The data set on earnings are further classified into four groups by the educational background:&#13;
illiteracy or no education, primary education (those who have completed 6 years of primary&#13;
schooling), secondary (additional 6 years of schooling beyond primary level), and higher&#13;
education (additional 4 years of schooling beyond secondary level). While this four-group&#13;
classification is useful particularly for international comparison, earning profiles can also be&#13;
obtained for five educational groups dividing the secondary into two: junior secondary and&#13;
senior secondary levels according to the current educational structure: 6 years for primary, 3&#13;
years for junior secondary, 3 years for senior secondary, and 4 years for tertiary education&#13;
3.     Based on the above age and education classifications , the average age-earnings profiles&#13;
were derived by level of education. The results show that: (1) earnings are positively correlated&#13;
with the level of education; (2) a profile tends to rise with age to a peak and then fall until&#13;
retirement age; (3) profiles for more highly educated individuals are steeper than for the less&#13;
educated; and (4) the higher the level of education, the later the age at which earnings reach their&#13;
peak (Figure 3-3-1). Although the profiles of higher educational levels lie above the lower&#13;
educational levels, there is some degree of conversion of the profiles at other levels. This is due&#13;
in part to the relatively small number of observations in the sample, which places unproportional&#13;
weight on exceptional sample cases. In addition to the sample population as a whole, the age-&#13;
education earnings profiles were also obtained for subgroups: male and female, poverty group&#13;
and non-poverty group, and urban and rural areas. The summary of the profiles for all age&#13;
groups is presented in Table 3-3-1.&#13;
For the purpose of this analysis, the new education structure is used considering its comparability and&#13;
relevance, instead of using the pre-1987 structure.&#13;

Costs of Education&#13;
4.     Costs of education consist of two important components: private and public costs.&#13;
Private cost is defined as that part of the investment in education which is incurred either by the&#13;
pupil or by his/her parents/guardian or by both. The private costs consist of two major elements:&#13;
(a) direct household costs on education including tuition fees and non-tuition costs such as&#13;
expenditure on books, stationary, transportation, uniformns, and meals; and (b) opportunity cost,&#13;
also known as "foregone earnings" that would have been earned had the pupil not attended&#13;
school. Foregone earnings have been derived on the basis of the age-earnings profiles&#13;
constructed from the GLSS3 data. In contrast, the public costs include the spending on&#13;
education by the public sector at large. The average earnings by level of education for the whole&#13;
sample and subgroups, presented in Table 3-3-1 above, can be taken as income foregone, and&#13;
both public and private unit costs of education are shown in Table 3-3-2.&#13;

Estimation of the Rate of Return to Education&#13;
5.     Based on mean earnings by each subgroup and unit costs presented above, the results of&#13;
estimating rates of return to different levels of education are presented in Table 3-3-3 using the&#13;
short-cut method2. Primary education in Ghana on average produces a private rate of return of&#13;
28 percent and a social rate of return of 19 percent. At the secondary level which for the sake of&#13;
this analysis combines the junior secondary and senior secondary levels, the return to education&#13;
is 12 percent and 10 percent for private and social rates respectively.&#13;

included as a part of the education costs in the calculation of both private and social rates of return&#13;

6.     The subgroup analysis (Table 3-3-4 below) shows that females benefit more from all&#13;
levels of education than males in terms of both private and social rates of return, highlighting the&#13;
importance of investments that will increase enrollment of girls. In addition, the poor benefit&#13;
2 The alternative 'full-method' using age-earning profiles, instead of mean earning profiles, tends to&#13;
provide more accurate results, but requires more reliable data set. The existing data set with lots of&#13;
missing data does not allow sensible subgroup analysis, hence only the result of the short-cut method&#13;
is presented. The full-method according to the present data set gives lower rates of return. Further&#13;
study will be necessary to reconcile the difference in the results from the different methods.&#13;
&#13;

considerably more from primary education than from any other level of education, suggesting&#13;
that interventions for increasing the poor's access to primary education will have high payoffs.&#13;
Compared with people in rural areas, people living in urban area show higher returns to all levels&#13;
of education except higher education, mainly due to job opportunities in urban areas.&#13;

7.    Mincerian method. The findings in the short-cut method is largely consistent with the&#13;
results using the semi-log earning function specification, developed by Mincer. The coefficient&#13;
on years of schooling can be interpreted as the average private rate of return to one additional&#13;
year of education, regardless of the education level to which this year of schooling refers. Again,&#13;
there are higher returns to one additional year of schooling for females than males. The&#13;
Mincerian method, however, gives different results on the rural-urban investment preference:&#13;
people in rural areas have somewhat higher returns than those in urban areas, suggesting that&#13;
targeting on rural areas would have a relatively higher pay off than on urban areas.&#13;

ANNEX 3-4. Fiscal Impact Analysis&#13;
The FCUBE program with support of the proposed credit aims at (a) improving the&#13;
teaching and learning process and outcome; (b) enhancing efficiency of basic education&#13;
management; (c) achieving better access and participation; and (d) helping establish a financially&#13;
sustainable education sector. For FCUBE to be financially sustainable, demand-driven policy&#13;
options need to be guided by factors derived from reasonable expectations as to how much&#13;
resources can be mobilized. Among various performance objectives, a few financially important&#13;
ones are selected from each program component for this analysis. Accordingly, both demand&#13;
(access and quality) and supply factors (resource availability) have been considered.&#13;
Approach&#13;
The analysis has been done in the following process:&#13;
i.    Enrollment projections&#13;
ii.    Teacher analysis&#13;
iii.    Cost analysis&#13;
iv.    Resources analysis&#13;
v.    Analysis of different scenarios (low, medium, high)&#13;
These analyses are based on three scenarios, each presuming different macroeconomic&#13;
environments and resources available to the education sector. Some elements of sensitivity&#13;
analysis are also included in the scenario analysis, such as the impact of the class flow efficiency&#13;
under the FCUBE reform on enrollment and costs.&#13;
Low Scenario. Ghana fails to maintain macroeconomic stability and the economy grows only at&#13;
3 percent annually. However, the strong financial commitment of the Government to education&#13;
is not likely to fade, and MOE's share of the total recurrent budget is sustained. Education costs&#13;
for the poor are prohibitive, and GOG can not extend financial support to them.&#13;
Medium Scenario. The present level of economic growth (5 percent annually) is sustained.&#13;
Macroeconomic conditions are stable, and public spending including MOE's recurrent budget&#13;
stays at a constant share of GDP. The private sector's growth in providing education service&#13;
continues at the present pace until it slows at the market plateau.&#13;
High Scenario. The macroeconomic environment is favorable and the Ghanaian economy&#13;
grows at a higher rate (7 percent per year). Gains from growth are clearly visible in the&#13;
increased private provision of basic education, and increased household spending on education&#13;
contributes to improvements in children's learning achievement.&#13;
1. Enrollment projection. Ghana has a policy of automatic promotion throughout the basic&#13;
education cycle. The student flow model used is based on admission into the primary school,&#13;
promotion, repetition and dropout. It allows for measuring the impact of improvements in the&#13;
flow efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3-4&#13;
Fiscal Impact Analysis&#13;
Results of enrollment projections are affected by policy decisions on giving priority to quality-&#13;
improvement or enrollment expansion. Ghana's choice of quality improvement as a priority is&#13;
sound, especially if we take into account the interaction between improvements in the quality of&#13;
education and increases in enrollment. However, the quality emphasis requires increasing&#13;
contribution by the private sector to education service delivery, which in turn requires economic&#13;
environments favorable to private sector growth. The following table gives the enrollment&#13;
projections under the medium case scenario based on the combination of the policies that are&#13;
described in the following page.&#13;
Enrollment: Medium Case Scenario&#13;

admission rate into PI       82.5%       94.0%      108.8%&#13;

gross enrollment ratio      58.7%       67.5%       79.0%&#13;
2. Teacher analysis. The annual net increase in the teaching force is derived from the number&#13;
of new teachers recruited, teacher attrition rate, and a redeployment of administrative staff with&#13;
teacher's qualifications back to schools. The number of new recruits is decided by several&#13;
factors: a pupil-teacher ratio as a monitoring reference, TTCs' supply capacity, actual TTC&#13;
graduates who take teaching posts, and the impact on the wage bill. The analysis indicates that&#13;
annual recruitment of some 4,000 new primary teachers would be appropriate over the FCUBE&#13;
period, while for junior secondary, the number needs to be raised gradually from the present&#13;
level of 1,100 to 1,900. MOE should make efforts not to enlarge the size of the teacher salary&#13;
envelope beyond the rate of the overall real MOE budget increase. Given the present level of&#13;
"waste" in graduates, supply capacity of the existing TTCs is not taken as fully and efficiently&#13;
utilized, hence no additional TTCs need to be constructed in the medium term.&#13;

ANNEX 3-4&#13;
Fiscal Impact Analysis&#13;
3. Cost Analysis. The model incorporates all expenditures incurred at all levels (i.e., the central&#13;
and local governments, at the school and household levels). It looks at the salary of teachers;&#13;
costs of textbooks and other educational materials; administrative costs including overhead,&#13;
operation and maintenance costs; costs of building new schools and their maintenance, and&#13;
various costs to the household. The total 10-year costs of the FCUBE program implementation&#13;
will be US$2.9 billion, of which the first 5-year phase will be US$1.3 billion. Instead of a&#13;
conventional approach using a unit cost per pupil, the model uses a detailed breakdown which&#13;
allows for measuring the impact of changing the policy pertaining to each of the cost items.&#13;
Average teacher salary, including the incentive package, will not increase by more than 2 percent&#13;
annually, in real terms, and in reality, should be in harmony with the movement of other public&#13;
services salaries. To provide the necessary educational materials to all the students, about 18&#13;
percent of recurrent expenditure needs to be spent over the period 1996-2005, implying that for&#13;
the sector to be sustainable, MOE's budget structure needs to be adjusted accordingly in a&#13;
gradual manner. If successful, central administration can become leaner, and in 10 years&#13;
administrative costs can be reduced from the present level of 10.4 percent to 8.7 percent of the&#13;
recurrent costs. This can be achieved through various efforts to make sectoral management more&#13;
efficient. During the second phase of the FCUBE program (2001-2005), betterment costs of&#13;
US$205 million is estimated, of which supply of textbooks and other educational materials alone&#13;
will account for some 90 percent of the costs.&#13;

Fiscal Impact Analysis&#13;
4. Financing Analysis. All domestically available financial resources are included in this&#13;
submodel: the central budget, intergovernmental transfers, local government's own generated&#13;
fund, and contributions from households. MOE's budget is assumed to grow at the same pace as&#13;
the country's economic growth. Internal allocation of the budget is considered to remain&#13;
unchanged because basic education's receipt of 65% of the recurrent budget is already favorable,&#13;
and increasing pressure is expected on the secondary and higher levels of education as a result of&#13;
improved basic education. Gradual reallocation within the basic education subsector will&#13;
become necessary as the relative demand for junior secondary education increases. The total&#13;
resources domestically available to fund the FCUBE program over the period 1996-2005 will be&#13;
US$2.6 billion, and US$ 1.1 billion for the first phase. Funds to be mobilized externally are not&#13;
taken into account in here, and will be used to help fill the financing gap. Allowing further&#13;
increases in the average teacher' salary, even marginally from 2 to 3 percent annually, is justified&#13;
only under the higher economic growth scenario in which more GOG budget for the education&#13;
sector will be available relative to the low and medium scenarios. Under the Medium Scenario,&#13;
the combination of policy options requires additional US$176 million over the period 1996-&#13;
2000, annually US$40 million on average, to be mobilized externally. Of this additional&#13;
resource requirement, US$151 million has been already committed so far by the program&#13;
cofinanciers including UNICEF, USAID, ODA, and Germany, and EU and the governments of&#13;
Japan and Norway have indicated their interest in contributing to the program. The proposed&#13;
IDA credit is expected to contribute US$ 50 million.&#13;
In all scenarios, even though adequate capital costs for additional intake are estimated,&#13;
still about 30 percent of classes will have no classroom of their own. This requires continuing&#13;
the double-shifting, particularly in densely populated areas.&#13;
Overall, Ghana's FCUBE objectives of quality improvement and universalizing basic&#13;
education are attainable, for the primary level within the coming 10-year period, and up to the&#13;
junior secondary level by the year 2010. Toward the end of the 10-year program, different sets&#13;
of policies will be warranted to ensure financial sustainability. These include, among others, a&#13;
review of policies on the intra-sectoral allocation of resources, annual demand for new teacher&#13;
recruitment, and adequate arrangement to continue the provision of educational materials which&#13;
will become increasingly more costly.&#13;

made in the basic education suib.sector since the start of our cducation refonn&#13;
programme in 1987, and give an outline of further policy initiatives that the&#13;
Government plans to implement in this sub-sector over the next ten years.&#13;
A. Background and Goals&#13;
Basic education is the fundamental building block of any nation. Given that the loiig-&#13;
term vision for Ghana is to become a middle-income countuy by the year 2020, a Ivncli-&#13;
pin of thc governrnent's developmnent plan is a nation-wide. susLained effort to expand.&#13;

suren,grhcn. and make more relevant its basic education systcm. In recognrition of this, the&#13;
Government seeks to provide quality basic educalion (8F) for all school age ch)Idrcn as&#13;
soon as is practicable.&#13;
The central goal of the BE system in Ghana is to ensure that all young people are equipped&#13;
v,ith the fundamental knowledge. attitudes and skills that will enable them to be active&#13;
participants in and beneficiaries of national development.&#13;
The policy initiatives outlined below are the Government's response to a cons-iturionally-&#13;
mandated charge. Article 39(2) c the 1992 Constitution of the Fourth Republic of Ghana&#13;
states:&#13;
The Govemment shall, within two years after Parliament first meets after coming&#13;
into force of this constitution. draw up a programme for implementation wivthin the&#13;
Following ten years, (or the provision of free, compulsory and universal basic&#13;
education.&#13;
B. Structure&#13;
The resrructuring of the educ2tion sysiem has been a k-ey element of the reform that srarred&#13;
in 1 987. The current system consists of Primary (grades l-6); Junior Secondary (grades 7-&#13;
9). togerher forming a nine-year BE cycle; followed by Senior Secondary (10-12);&#13;
Technical; and several optional forms of Tertiary Education that include universities,&#13;
polytechnics and teacher training colleges.&#13;
C- Financing&#13;
The Government's emphasis on the importance of education in the development process is&#13;
unequivocal. The proportion of the national recurrent budget (net oi debt servicing and&#13;
orher extra-budgetary items) allocated to education has increased from 31 percent in 1987&#13;
ro almost 39 percent as an average over the past five years. Intra-sectoral allocation has&#13;
been increasingly in favour of BE which is currently receiving about 65 percent of MOE's&#13;
recurrent budget (up from 60 percent in 1989). Govemment resource commitments to&#13;
education as set out in the policy document "Ghana; Vision 2020" are projected to&#13;
increase proportionately with national economic growth rates and to stay at 40 percent of&#13;
the national budget through to 2000.&#13;
D. IKey Issues in Basic Education&#13;
Key issues in basic education in Ghana mray be care,orised into four areas:&#13;
Poor Teaching and learning ouLcomes&#13;

ihe volume of materials and equipmenr inco the cecror has incrc_sed, and rncre scnool&#13;
zacilities have resulted in increased enrolments- Yer the reform has had limited success in&#13;
dclivering quality teaching and leaminir7 outcomes. Pupil achievement concinues to be&#13;
very disappointing. Reasons for weak Il-arnin- rccults include: lack of learning materials,&#13;
aind even where available, teachers often do nor rnake effective use of ci ern; inadequate&#13;
funding oi non-;alary recurrent expenses: high levels of pupil and teacher absenirneism,&#13;
inefficient use of teacher. pupil instructional contact hours; outmoded pre-s-ervice teacher&#13;
training and inadequate in-service teacher development; unmorivated teachers owing to&#13;
unataractive incentives, ineffective sanctions and low social status of .eachers; an overly&#13;
ambitious curriculum, burden-some to boch teachers and pupils; and lack of suitable&#13;
phYs5cal facilities in many locations.&#13;
Access and Gcnder Sias&#13;
Across the country, conspicuous dispariry exists in access to basic education services&#13;
between boys and girls, rhe rich and thc poor, and arnong geographic regions. 8E is&#13;
supposed to be tuition-free and open to all Currentiv. insufficient access. poor quality and&#13;
financial consrraints make the policy more of a promise than a reality. Nominal gross&#13;
enrolments at the primary and junior 5econdary levels stand at 78 and 38 per cent&#13;
respeciively of the relevant age cohorts. There are also equity concerns. Enrolments in the&#13;
northern regions are up to 30 per cenr lower than the national average. In some areas,&#13;
girls comprise only 35 per cent of primary and as little as 28 per cenr of junior secondary&#13;
enrolments. Aithough primary enrolmenrs have grown by about 25 percent since the&#13;
reform programme began, expansion has come without the requisite improvement in the&#13;
quality of teachin- and leaming. Furthermore, the expansion has not been rapid enough ro&#13;
keep up with the pace of the school-age population growth resulting in a stagnating or&#13;
even declining rarios oi BE gross enrolment. Insufficienr infrastructure, family poverty,&#13;
unavailability of teachers and geographic isolation all coincide to form a complex web of&#13;
drsadvantage.&#13;
Inappropriate Management Structures and Weak Management Capacity&#13;
Effective managernent within the educarion sector depends upon rhe management&#13;
capabilities of the central Ministry, the GES. the districrs and the schools thnem5elves. With&#13;
Govemment firmly cornmitted to the process of decentralisacion of administration oi public&#13;
secior institutions, including education. capabilities have to be improved to meet The&#13;
requirements of a system under which discricis and communities themselves will have&#13;
enhanced responsibility and authority to improve the quality of and participation in&#13;
education at the school level. However, incomplete and unclear transfer of authority, lac:-:&#13;
of clarity in job descriptions, ineffective ;uff posting procedures, inadequate planning,&#13;
nmonitoring and evaluation, and inadequarely trained scaff at all levels of rnana,ement have&#13;
2l conrribured to harnperina the effcc-ive crriplen,entra7on of decenrr.rlrsacinn pcbCiv.&#13;

community participation in school governance.&#13;
Inadequatc Resource Mobilisation and Inefficient Util;sation&#13;
The education sector has been receiving about 39 percent of Government's discretionary&#13;
recurrent budget; and around 3 percent of the development (capital investrment&#13;
programme) budget. The expenditure side has been constantly affected by uncertainties in&#13;
salary raises and number of staff on the payroll. MOE's actual expenditures have been&#13;
overrunning the budget, but nearly the entire overrun can be attributed to salary related&#13;
expenses. The absence of a reliable and timely expenditure monitoring system is partly&#13;
responsible for this.&#13;
Furthermore, internal resource allocation within the basic education sub-sector is heavily&#13;
influenced by the sheer size of the wage bill. Of the total MOE/GES expenditures,&#13;
personnel emoluments account for 85 percent. When looking at school-level basic&#13;
education expenditure, around 98 percent of the national recurrent allocation is absorbed&#13;
by the salary related costs and only the tiny remainder is available for teaching/learning&#13;
materials, school operation and maintenance.&#13;
11 ELEMENTS OF THE BASIC EDUCATION INITIATIVE&#13;

Alternativc service delivery arrangements to the traditional model will be piloted. Orie or&#13;
the most important lessons leamed since the current education reform programme is that&#13;
continuing to expand access to basic education and to increase physical inputs Into the&#13;
system are not effective unless the qualiry of activities at the school level improves&#13;
si-nificantly.&#13;
B. Key Components&#13;
The Government affirms that quality improvement will receive the highest prioriry in the&#13;
FCUBE initiative. All activities under the Programme will cover a 10-year period from&#13;
I 996-2005. and will be implemented in two 5-year phases. This initiative is the sole&#13;
programrne for basic education improvement in Ghana, and will embrace all current and&#13;
future acrivities supported from national and external funding sources. The Programme is&#13;
composed of three components which will be implemenred in a comprehensive and&#13;
carefully integrated fashion.&#13;
1.  Imgroving rhe Qualiry of Teaching and Learning&#13;
The pedagogical improvement component will promote effective teaching by enhancing&#13;
specific teaching skills through pre-service and mainly school-based in-service training&#13;
programmes, and bv improving teacher morale and motivating staff through a teacher&#13;
incentive programme. Improvement in rhe quality of leaming and student performance&#13;
will be promoted through curriculum review and adaptation; the reprinting of existing and&#13;
production of new learning materials, syllabuses and teachers handbooks; and the regular&#13;
mccsccmant of pup;l porformrxanco to inforrr tachrr., parontr 3fnd pupdlt rhemeal_koc oi t&amp;cir&#13;
progress and to provide objective measures to evaluate basic education.&#13;
Key elements include&#13;
a)  Strengthening capabilities in curriculum and learning materials developrnent,&#13;
procurement, distribution and resupply;&#13;
b) Ensuring that the curriculum is pedagogically sound, re!evant and&#13;
implernentable in all basic schools;&#13;
cJ Designing and irnplementing a cost-effective textbook production and&#13;
distributiorn sysrem that will ensure universal coveragc of texts in all subjects and&#13;
tra.ides for every student:&#13;

e)   Restructuring both pre- and in-service teacher craining and insisting on highc;r&#13;
standards of teacher cerriiication, including more emphasis on classroom-based&#13;
experiences;&#13;
2.  Imoroving mannagemont Fffiienry&#13;
The overall objective of this component is to improve both the eFficiency and effecEivcnes,&#13;
oi the Ministry of Educarion (MOE) and the Ghana EducaLion Service (GES) through&#13;
managerial reform. In order to ensure that new and existing resource invesemcnts are&#13;
wisely allocated and effectively utilised, activities will be focused on bringing greater&#13;
discretion, discipline and accountability to schools, thereby increasing reaching&#13;
effectiveness. The component will also increase the timeliness, accuracy and relevancy of&#13;
data to be used for monitoring pcrformance at the district and school levels. I here will be&#13;
targeted interventions to improve instruction and student 2chievement and to achieve a&#13;
more rational and equitable allocation of resources For inirastrucrure, materials, and&#13;
personnel.&#13;
This component will be implemented in three stagces whichi, alrthough conceptually&#13;
distincr, in practice will overlap.&#13;
Key elements include:&#13;
a)   Redesigning management srruatures which suit the roles and responsibilities or&#13;
the MOE and the CES at headquarters, regional and district leve!s and which provide&#13;
for appropriate delegation on operational maters;&#13;
b)  Improving mechanisms for monitoring performance at the district and school&#13;
levels and performance standards and targets for all agencies linked to the strategic&#13;
goals of FCUBE;&#13;
c)  Installing an Education Management Information System (Eh415) to collect,&#13;
analyse, process and report educational data for planning, decision making and&#13;
mt;nitoring purposes;&#13;
d)  Strengthening personnel management practices which motivate individuals,&#13;
groups and departments throughout the sysrern towards achieving berrer&#13;
perrormances;&#13;

qualfied managers and having adequate discretionary budgets in place to ensure that&#13;
rhe financ.al resources available can make significant impact on the quality of&#13;
education.&#13;
3.  Imkrov'rz Accezs and ParcicoPtian&#13;
The quanrtiative expansion and enhanced participation component will promote wider&#13;
coverage of basic education services by applying selection criteria for building new&#13;
schools; replac,ng schools with poor infrastructure; expanding overcrowded schools;&#13;
rehabilitating school physical infrastructure; providing houses for additional teachers; and&#13;
by developing alternative delivery mechanisms. Measures to increase demand for basic&#13;
education will receive special attention. Girls, poor and rural children will be targeted.&#13;
FCUBE will use a variety of approaches to increase access to schooling by girls and under-&#13;
represented groups including Infrastructural development and rehabilitation. Options&#13;
include: the provision of scholarships; incentives for female teachers and teachers in&#13;
remote areas; a pilot scheme to enable rural communities to hire local teachers; an&#13;
emphasis on gender equity and sensitivity in materials and in training programmes; and the&#13;
use of Participatory Learning Appraisal methodologies in selected regions to encourage&#13;
community involvement in and understanding of the need for schooling. On the supply&#13;
side, MOE will first examine and rationalise the use of existing resources. The challenge of&#13;
meeting the increased demand for facilities and services will be tackled from two&#13;
perspectives: using existing school facilities to maximum effectiveness; and targeting new&#13;
infrastructure to those places where careful investigation has shown there to be most&#13;
benefit in providing increased access.&#13;
Key elements include:&#13;
a)  Strengthening School Management Committees;&#13;
b)  Improving mechanisms for consultation with District Assembly committees on&#13;
education to ensure the appropriate allocation of funds to basic education, and its&#13;
deployment in an equitable manner;&#13;
c)   Enhancing the system for stakeholder consultation to provide feedback on&#13;
progress towards programme goals;&#13;
d)  Operating a school improvement fund which will be directly accessible to&#13;
schools; and&#13;

III   FINANCING POLICIES&#13;
The Government will continue to provide at least the same percentage af the&#13;
discretionary recurrent budget to education sector each year during 1996-2000&#13;
as it has provided over the past five years. Within the education sector,&#13;
allocation to basic education sub-sector will be maintained at the present level,&#13;
although the distribution between primary and junior secondary levels will&#13;
changeover time.&#13;
The Government's FCUBE financing plan is the key reference document for&#13;
national resource mobilization and its effective use for BE. The plan entails&#13;
various quantitative "floor level targets' which were summarised in the table&#13;
below. Actual resources mobilized and spent, as well as the policy targets will&#13;
be monitored regularly, and possible adjustments willbe discussed at regular&#13;
review meetings of the financing partners.&#13;
Implementation of FCUBE, in particular through improving personnel, education&#13;
performance and financial management, will generate efficiency gains that will&#13;
result in savings in the budget. An understanding has been reached between the&#13;
Ministries of Finance and Education that MOE will implement the financial&#13;
management strategies outlined in its policy document to ensure sound financial&#13;
practices. This will allow MOE to re-allocate the approved budget within the&#13;
recurrent and capital/development activities respectively.&#13;
For the quality of basic education to be assured, the number of teaching staff will&#13;
need to be increased as enrollments grow. The Government will make every&#13;
effort to ensure that total number of staff and overall salary expenditure for the&#13;
Ghana Education Service (GES) staff will be consistent with the FCUBE financing&#13;
plan and national public sector salary guidelines. The ratio between the&#13;
number of teachers in schools and GES administrative staff in the system as a&#13;
whole (including GES staff in administrative posts) is presently 4.8:1. This figure&#13;
will be monitored so that the overhead cost of adminstration will be reduced by&#13;
shifting the balance in favor of teachers in the classroom.&#13;
Provision and maintenance of school facilities are the responsibility of local&#13;
government. Apart from earmarked external aid support and the nationaly&#13;
provided District Assembly Common Fund (DACF), resources are mobilized at&#13;
the district and school levels but are far from adequate. The Government will&#13;
encourage district authorities to increase the proportion of spending from DACF&#13;
for basic education steadily not only to the present guideline figure of 10% but&#13;
even beyond. Levies collected at the district and school levels must accord with&#13;
the MOE guidelines. The Government will undertake to delegate progressively&#13;
financial management discretion to designated districts having viable education&#13;
plans and administrative systems, and will consider compensatory measures&#13;
8&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;

where districts still face financial problems even after making an adequate fiscal&#13;
effort.&#13;
The Government maintains its policy that tuition for basic education is free for&#13;
children and parents/guardians. However, for the attainment of FCUBE&#13;
objectives, and for securing a heightened commitment and sense of community&#13;
ownership of schools, it is necessary that beneficlaries of basic education&#13;
services continue to contribute to direct and indirect costs other than tuition.&#13;
As part of the FCUBE objectives, target enrolments in private schools will&#13;
increase from the present 10.7% for the primary level to 14% by 2000 and 16%&#13;
by 2005, and from 3.0% for the junior secondary level to 6.6% by 2000 and&#13;
16% by 2005. For the time being, Government will continue the present policy&#13;
of providing the textbooks and some teachers to private schools. Meanwhile,&#13;
there will be a study on appropriate measures to subsidise the private sector,&#13;
considering the implementation for financial sustalnability of the education&#13;
system as a whole.&#13;

IV. COLLABORATION AND COMMITMENT&#13;
To be successful, (he effort will depend heavily upon collaboration among a number of&#13;
agencies and groups. Fundamentally, BE is, and must be, a locally supporred activity.&#13;
District officials, school heads, teachers, parents and students will share the largest burden&#13;
for the successful implem.entation of this effort and they will enjoy the grealest benefits.&#13;

Supervision Plan&#13;
Supervision of implementation will be conducted (i) under the direction of the&#13;
Program Coordinator (MOE/GES) reporting to the IOC; and (ii) by the World Bank Task&#13;
Management Team, in collaboration with GOG and other funding partners.&#13;
I. Routine MOE/GES supervision will include initial review:&#13;
(a) prior to forwarding to IDA for "no objection" of:&#13;
i. Procurement documents&#13;
ii. Disbursement requests&#13;
iii. Special accounts expenditures/reimbursements and statements of&#13;
expenses (SOEs)&#13;
(b) monthly financial statements&#13;
(c) arranging for annual audits of project accounts and SOEs&#13;
II. Periodic MOE/GES supervision will involve:&#13;
(a) updating the rolling implementation plan&#13;
(b) preparing progress reports on project implementation&#13;
(c) monitoring key performance indicators&#13;
(d) liaising with the World Bank Field Office and IDA supervision&#13;
missions&#13;
III.   Bank staff will spend an estimated 6 staff-weeks per annum on average at&#13;
headquarters and the Resident Mission reviewing and commenting on procurement&#13;
documents and disbursement requests; and a further 4 staff-weeks per annum over the course&#13;
of project execution for desk work relating to progress reports and audited accounts (total of&#13;
40 s.w. for the life of the Credit).&#13;
In addition, there will be field supervision (as set out below). Semi-annual reviews&#13;
of program performance will be undertaken by GOG, IDA and participating donors in&#13;
January/February and in June/July; the Consultative Panel (CP) Meeting for 1998 will be&#13;
enhanced to become the MTR. TOR will be prepared jointly by CP members at least two&#13;
months prior to the review date. The Jan/Feb review will focus mainly on the performance&#13;
of the preceding year and the Jun/Jul review on finalizing operational plans and financial&#13;
commitments for the coming year. The MTR will assess physical, institutional and financial&#13;
progress of the first 2 years of project implementation as measured against agreed targets.&#13;
Based on the MTR, the program will be adjusted to be consistent with the targets in the light&#13;
of experience and changing circumstances.&#13;
