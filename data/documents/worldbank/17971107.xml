Q: Good morning. Today is Thursday, May 29th, 2003, and Iâ&#128;&#152;m William Becker with the&#13;
Business History Group and the George Washington University.&#13;
&#13;
Q: And Iâ&#128;&#152;m Marie Zenni, Task Manager of the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s Oral History Program.&#13;
&#13;
Q: We are here today to interview Mohamed T. El-Ashry, prior to his imminent retirement in&#13;
July of this year from his current post as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the&#13;
Global Environment Facility (GEF), and from the World Bank Group, having previously served&#13;
as Chief Environmental Adviser to the Bank President as well as Director of the Environment&#13;
Department. Weâ&#128;&#152;d like to begin talking a little bit about your background and ask if you would&#13;
please discuss your educational background and especially your interest in geology.&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: I graduated in 1959 with a Bachelor of Science degree with honors from the&#13;
University of Cairo in geology, and then following that I came to the U.S. and went to graduate&#13;
school at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign and received a Masterâ&#128;&#152;s degree in 1963&#13;
and a Ph.D. in 1966, all in geology.&#13;
&#13;
How did I get to geology in the first place? Well, like many young boys, in particular in the&#13;
culture that I grew up in, your parents wanted you to be a doctor, a doctor of medicine. And so&#13;
during high school I took the science track, science and math track, but in my senior year of high&#13;
school, I was only 15, and that was when they started some discoveries of oil in Egypt, and I&#13;
thought that would be an interesting field to go to. Not that I wasnâ&#128;&#152;t interested in medicine, but I&#13;
gathered that if I go to the faculty of science, itâ&#128;&#152;s only four years, Iâ&#128;&#152;d graduate at the age of 19,&#13;
and then Iâ&#128;&#152;d get a scholarship to go abroad and get a Ph.D. Iâ&#128;&#152;d still become a doctor, but itâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
something that Iâ&#128;&#152;d really want to do. And thatâ&#128;&#152;s how it worked out.&#13;
&#13;
Q: OK. Could you talk a little bit about your career and the focus of your work prior to joining&#13;
the World Bank group?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: All right. After receiving my Ph.D. in 1966, I went back to Egypt and I became&#13;
assistant professor in the geology department that I graduated from at Cairo University.&#13;
&#13;
Unfortunately, a year later the â&#128;&#152;67 war started, which restricted tremendously any effort at&#13;
research. Everything became military secret. I was trained to use aerial photographs and space&#13;
photographs. You could not get a single one of them because now itâ&#128;&#152;s a military secret. You&#13;
could not get geographic maps either. So it was only a matter of teaching and thatâ&#128;&#152;s about it. So&#13;
many of my friends that were educated in the U.S. or in Europe left a year later in 1968. But I&#13;
stuck it out till 1969, and when I realized that things are not changing anytime soon or fast, I&#13;
thought three years had been wasted without any research, without a single paper published, so I&#13;
decided to leave.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Mohamed T. El-Ashry&#13;
                                 May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I left in â&#128;&#152;69, came back to the U.S., and then I decided to accept an offer from a small university&#13;
in Pennsylvania called Wilkes University, in Wilkes-Barre, and it was mainly because the person&#13;
who was hiring wanted someone who would be interested in the environment. It was something&#13;
new. It was a year before Earth Day; the first Earth Day was April 1970. So we put together the&#13;
first two courses in environmental science, Environmental Science 101, Environmental Science&#13;
102, and geology was a very convenient background to actually develop that. Environmental&#13;
Science is more like earth science. You talk about whatâ&#128;&#152;s happening on the surface of the earth,&#13;
and how human beings interfere with these processes and affect them one way or the other,&#13;
which relates again to what I did in my Mastersâ&#128;&#152; and Ph.D. dissertations. Thatâ&#128;&#152;s really what got&#13;
me interested in the whole area of the environment. I dealt with shoreline changes along the&#13;
Atlantic and the Gulf Coasts of the U.S., and very quickly, even though I was looking at geologic&#13;
processes and the movement of sand and so on, you realize how much human intervention has&#13;
actually accelerated shore erosion in areas where the Army Corps of Engineers was building&#13;
jetties and so on, and trapping the sand that should have replenished to other parts of the coast.&#13;
So that was my first interest in addressing these processes in greater depth. In 1972, I turned the&#13;
environmental science program at Wilkes into a Department of Environmental Sciences, which&#13;
probably was the first degree-offering department in environmental sciences in the United States.&#13;
&#13;
In 1975 I decided that when I graduated my first class, that perhaps itâ&#128;&#152;s time to do something&#13;
else. So I had an offer from the University of California at Santa Barbara, which would have&#13;
been in geology and environmental studies, and we had collaborated with them in the&#13;
environmental studies area. But at the same time, I had an offer from an environmental group.&#13;
They were new at the time, and this group was unique in the sense that it hired only Ph.D.&#13;
scientists and lawyers. The scientists would do the research; the lawyers would sue the&#13;
government for the purpose of improving environmental conditions in the United States,&#13;
particularly in ensuring the implementation of the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act and&#13;
addressing a number of other major environmental issues. So, I decided maybe I should take a&#13;
year or two out of academia just to know how these things happen in the real world in the first&#13;
place. Mainly, what is the politics behind them? We teach these things to the students, but we&#13;
donâ&#128;&#152;t really know how they came about in the first place. And I never got back to teaching since&#13;
then. So I stayed there for four years, worked out of the Denver office on water resources, in&#13;
particular, water resource management in the western U.S.&#13;
&#13;
Q: And what group was that?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: That was the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). Now itâ&#128;&#152;s called Environmental&#13;
Defense, but still carries EDF as its acronym.&#13;
&#13;
In 1979 I was recruited by the Tennessee Valley Authority. President [Jimmy] Carter was&#13;
leaning more and more towards the environment, and TVA was known as the biggest polluter in&#13;
the United States because of its power plants and because of all the dams, reservoirs, and the&#13;
poor water quality in there. David Freeman was appointed TVAâ&#128;&#152;s Chairman of the Board, and he&#13;
decided that the only way he was going to make some changes internally was to recruit someone&#13;
from outside who knows about the environment. So through friends they contacted me.&#13;
Eventually, I took the job in 1979 and built an Environmental Quality Staff, as it was called,&#13;
EQS. There was also an environmental Compliance Staff that I headed as well, and we started&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Mohamed T. El-Ashry&#13;
                                May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
moving towards improving the conditions of the environment in the valley through the actions of&#13;
the TVA itself. And, in fact, we got on the map in a big way by becoming the first utility, if you&#13;
will, that adopted a policy on acid rain. That was the time when utilities in the U.S. were fighting&#13;
against acid rain legislation, but we came out with a policy that would reduce actually by 50&#13;
percent the sulfur emissions of the power plants of TVA.&#13;
&#13;
In 1982 a friend of mine, his name is Gus [J. Gustave] Speth, who was Chairman of the&#13;
Presidentâ&#128;&#152;s Council on Environmental Quality under President Carter, received the largest single&#13;
grant ever for any NGO, $15 million from the MacArthur Foundation, to establish the World&#13;
Resources Institute. WRI was unique in that it would deal with global environmental issues and&#13;
not just national environmental ones. He called me and said that he wants me to come and join&#13;
and help in putting that thing together. I said, â&#128;&#149;Well, I really cannot join until the end of this&#13;
year,â&#128;&#150;â&#128;&#148;â&#128;&#151;83 by then--â&#128;&#149;because I have some unfinished business at TVA.â&#128;&#150; Eventually, in October&#13;
â&#128;&#152;83, I joined the World Resources Institute as a senior associate, but very quickly I started&#13;
helping in building the whole institute. I became the Vice-President for policy and then Vice-&#13;
President for policy and research and then became the Senior Vice-President.&#13;
&#13;
In 1991 the World Bank was recruiting a director for its Environment Department that was&#13;
established in 1987, during the reorganization of â&#128;&#152;87, and they approached me. I came and talked&#13;
to them. Itâ&#128;&#152;s a long story, but I accepted the position on May 30, 1991. The story of accepting the&#13;
job in itself, I think, is a telling story about how the environment was perceived in the Bank at&#13;
that time.&#13;
&#13;
Q: That would be good. Aside from the reorganization in 1987, the Bank had faced a great deal&#13;
of criticism for a number of environmental disasters. Did that have something to do with your&#13;
being hired as well?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Iâ&#128;&#152;m absolutely sure that thatâ&#128;&#152;s the case because the Environment Department,&#13;
when it was established in â&#128;&#152;87, did not seem to really change much as far as the outside world is&#13;
concerned. It seemed like business as usual, but the Department was being touted by the Bank as&#13;
a change towards environmental sensitivity and environmental action.&#13;
&#13;
The President at the time was Barber Conable, and the pressure from the NGOs translated into&#13;
pressure from Congress, because Congress started to push some of these environmental&#13;
provisions into IDA [International Development Association] appropriations. And Barber&#13;
Conable, having been a former Congressman, as I hear it secondhand, was being told by his&#13;
colleagues, â&#128;&#149;You know, you are going around giving all these speeches about the importance of&#13;
the environment, but nothing is happening internally in the Bank on the environment.â&#128;&#150; So in&#13;
1990 he decided that what he needed is someone from outside the Bank who knows about the&#13;
environment to head the Environment Department and to start making whatever changes that&#13;
were needed.&#13;
&#13;
So in my first visit, I was asked by Wilfried Thalwitz, who was then Senior Vice-President for&#13;
where the Environment Department resides, what are my thoughts; coming from the outside and&#13;
observing the Bank from the outside? I told him what I thought an Environment Department&#13;
ought to do, along the line of my experience from the Environmental Quality Staff or the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Mohamed T. El-Ashry&#13;
                                May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Environment Department of TVA, so to speak. And he was interested. We kept talking and&#13;
talking, and he kept taking notes, and then he said, â&#128;&#149;Great. Weâ&#128;&#152;ll be back in touch.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
It was a day later that they called me again, and they said, â&#128;&#149;We want you to meet with a number&#13;
of other Vice-Presidents and Senior Vice-Presidents.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
So in meeting with Ernie Stern, who was the god of the World Bank at the time--and I say it with&#13;
all due respect; I think the Bank misses some of his abilities, but he also had his own views on&#13;
how these things ought to be done--and in talking with him, I said, â&#128;&#149;You know, the only way I&#13;
will take this job is if I have a direct line to the President.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
And he said, â&#128;&#149;Huh? No way.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
I said, â&#128;&#149;Well, I guess youâ&#128;&#152;ll have to look for someone else.â&#128;&#150; I said, â&#128;&#149;You contacted me. I did not&#13;
contact you, and I am telling you that I will not take your job. I will take the job if it is described&#13;
correctly. Otherwise, Iâ&#128;&#152;d be wasting my time.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
The reason I asked for a line to the President is based on my experience at TVA. Because I had a&#13;
direct line to the Chairman of the Board, and the Board there was a working Board--they met&#13;
every day to carry out the work of the Authority with the help of a general managerâ&#128;&#147;and we had&#13;
there something similar to the situation in the Bank, a utility, basically, which is called the Power&#13;
Department there, and they were resisting doing anything on the environment and always&#13;
claiming that, â&#128;&#149;Well, it will increase the rates on the users of the electricity, and that would be&#13;
politically unpopular,â&#128;&#150; and so on. So, while I did not run to the Chairman of the Board every day&#13;
to say, â&#128;&#149;Hey, theyâ&#128;&#152;re stone walling. Hey, theyâ&#128;&#152;re not listening to me,â&#128;&#150; the fact that everybody&#13;
knew that I could deal with him directly allowed for a give-and-take to work things out. In fact,&#13;
he would sometimes say, â&#128;&#149;Mohamed, I thought you would be tearing doors down. Instead you&#13;
are sitting and making compromises and so on.â&#128;&#150; I would reply, â&#128;&#149;Well, the process is as important&#13;
as the action.â&#128;&#150; But it was truly that direct line to the Chairman that I felt made me effective in&#13;
doing such a difficult job, and it was important to do the same thing here having known the Bank&#13;
from outside.&#13;
&#13;
So I said that to Ernie and we parted company. Sure enough, the next day I got a call to meet&#13;
with Barber Conable, the President. So I came and he started immediately by saying, â&#128;&#149;I&#13;
understand youâ&#128;&#152;re saying that you will not take this job unless you have a direct line to me, even&#13;
though you are a director and not a vice-president.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
And I said, â&#128;&#149;Yes, and before you go any further, let me tell you why.â&#128;&#150; And I told him exactly&#13;
what happened at TVA.&#13;
&#13;
And being a good politician, he said, â&#128;&#149;Well, donâ&#128;&#152;t worry. Not only will you have a direct line to&#13;
me, but Iâ&#128;&#152;ll take you to lunch every two weeks in the Executive Dining Room,â&#128;&#150;--there was an&#13;
Executive Dining Room at the time--â&#128;&#149;so that everybody can see that you have my ear.â&#128;&#150; I was&#13;
offered the job then on the spot by Barber Conable, and I accepted it, and we started from there.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Mohamed T. El-Ashry&#13;
                                 May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                       5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q: Now, let me, if I may, just go back to talk a little bit about the history of the environment in&#13;
the Bank, starting in the late 1970s, with James Lee. In your opinion, how much did NGO&#13;
criticism factor into the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s early pioneering efforts on the environment?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: A great deal. The Washington environmental community became truly very&#13;
strong in the â&#128;&#151;70s, and that was the time also that I joined EDF in Colorado. And you could see&#13;
how much can be done because the public was amenable to better quality of the environment.&#13;
They have witnessed the pollution, they have witnessed rivers that went on fire in Ohio, and they&#13;
remember the terrible air quality in Pittsburgh and other places, fish killed in many rivers and&#13;
lakes, people getting sick from air and water pollution, and people just felt that this is the right&#13;
thing to do. And the environmental movement took off from there and started truly to put&#13;
tremendous pressure on the government, mainly through Congress, and Congress was very&#13;
receptive because of their constituencies who wanted a clean environment. And thatâ&#128;&#152;s when the&#13;
majority of actions really took place.&#13;
&#13;
And then came the notion that, well, you have the World Bank also thatâ&#128;&#152;s dealing with all of&#13;
these projects in the developing countries where the environment is horrible in the first place.&#13;
Not only there is no improvement, but it might even be exacerbated by the actions of the World&#13;
Bank. But, more importantly, I think what the NGO community was after is that the Bank could&#13;
use its clout and its influence to help improve the environmental conditions in the developing&#13;
countries rather than just ensuring that its actions are not hurting or damaging the environment.&#13;
And that, I think, was something that the people inside the Bank did not really understand very&#13;
well. They did not think that they can, or maybe they did not want, to influence the governments,&#13;
and they started to take the incremental approach, a little piece at a time towards addressing the&#13;
issues related to Bank policies themselves as they relate to the projects and their activities out&#13;
there.&#13;
&#13;
Q: When you get to the Bank, you inherit a department that had been created really in â&#128;&#152;87.&#13;
Could you discuss the status of the Environment Department, which as I said was created in â&#128;&#152;87&#13;
as part of the reorganization? What was the status of the department when you took over as the&#13;
director?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: The department was very weak. It had people who truly didnâ&#128;&#152;t know much about&#13;
the environment. I used to joke at the time that there are economists wearing hats that say theyâ&#128;&#152;re&#13;
environmentalists, but they really do not know even how to spell the word on their hat.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Would this be true of Kenneth Piddington, your predecessor?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: He was the first one to be hired (Aprilâ&#128;&#152;88 to midâ&#128;&#152;91) to head the department, and&#13;
then when he left I was hired to replace him. But it was not his mistake. The Bank was not&#13;
serious about that the environment business and the department was a dumping ground for&#13;
anyone that does not fit in other areas. The Bank then did not have an easy time getting rid of&#13;
people. I witnessed it myself. I wanted to get rid of some people from the Environment&#13;
Department to be able to build it. Two to two and a half years, to be able to get rid of someone,&#13;
and thatâ&#128;&#152;s when I finally said, â&#128;&#149;No, no, no, no. You take them and put them somewhere else so&#13;
that I can vacate and refill the positions, rather than sitting and waiting till every position gets&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Mohamed T. El-Ashry&#13;
                                 May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
filled.â&#128;&#150; These were truly a bunch of nice people, good people, probably good economists, but&#13;
could not do the job as far as the environment is concerned. You needed environmental&#13;
specialists, you needed technical people who understand the issues, and that was my principle.&#13;
Build a department, not big, but strong and respected so that when they speak, people in the&#13;
Bank wonâ&#128;&#152;t dismiss what they are saying as coming out of left field. And that was the beginning&#13;
of building, first, the Environment Department, and later, the environmental capability of the&#13;
different regions under Lew Preston. But we can get to that later on.&#13;
&#13;
Q: So this was your first goal, to professionalize really, in an important way, the staff? Did you&#13;
have other goals?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Absolutely. Because you know, you can sit for two years doing nothing while you&#13;
are building staff. So it was a matter of picking immediate priorities that needed to be addressed,&#13;
and in my mind, it was the environmental assessment of Bank projects. That was extremely&#13;
important because before you can influence anyone to do something, youâ&#128;&#152;ve got to show it in&#13;
your own action, and as a result, this would eventually spill over into adopting other policies in&#13;
the countries you operate in. The Bank was involved in building many dams out there, as well as&#13;
power plants, roads, and coal mines. All are activities that have a tremendous amount of&#13;
environmental impact and degradation.&#13;
&#13;
In fact, the efforts on the environmental assessment guidelines had started before I got to the&#13;
Bank. When I saw what is being put together, I felt like here we are in 1991, and they are trying&#13;
to adopt environmental assessment guidelines and standards that took place back in the â&#128;&#151;80s&#13;
rather than adopting internationally recognized standards that would fit the prestige of a place&#13;
like the World Bank. And I knew, because I helped put together the environmental assessment&#13;
guidelines and standards for the Tennessee Valley Authority. So I rejected what was being done,&#13;
and I said, â&#128;&#149;No, thatâ&#128;&#152;s not how itâ&#128;&#152;s going to be done. Weâ&#128;&#152;ve got to preserve the credibility of the&#13;
Bank by adopting international standards and retrofitting them to Bank activities and needs.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
Q: So this leads to the Environmental Assessment Sourcebook, which . . .&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Eventually, eventually. But getting there was not a walk in the park. Immediately&#13;
I was met with tremendous resistance, tremendous rejection, and it became a huge fight. At that&#13;
time there was the Operations Complex, as it was called, and that was all the operations&#13;
departments and vice-presidencies for the regions under one Senior Vice-President at the time.&#13;
And I belonged to another Senior Vice-President, Wilfried Thalwitz, who was impressed by&#13;
what I told him I wanted to do, how I saw the Environment Department, and he said, â&#128;&#149;Youâ&#128;&#152;re the&#13;
expert. You do it.â&#128;&#150; So he did not give in to the pressure from Operations, and that was truly&#13;
tremendous credit for him. He said, â&#128;&#149;You have done it before. Youâ&#128;&#152;re on your own. Go out and&#13;
do it, and if you need my help, let me know.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
So I went about it exactly the way I did at TVA. I did not go scream to the President or anybody.&#13;
I tried to work it out. And as I said, there was tremendous resistance and tremendous fight. All&#13;
my energy in the first two months, outside of trying to find some good people to be hired, was&#13;
put into that effort. There was meeting after meeting, meeting the Senior Vice-President for&#13;
Operations, the Regional Vice-Presidents, and so on. In every case Iâ&#128;&#152;m being told, â&#128;&#149;Why are you&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Mohamed T. El-Ashry&#13;
                                May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
doing this? This is going to delay things, this is going to cost us money, and this is going to be&#13;
rejected by the countries. We will not be able to move through our activities the way we have&#13;
done it before.â&#128;&#150; And of course you explain, â&#128;&#149;But the way you have done it before was not the&#13;
right way, and this will allow for better decision-making.â&#128;&#150; It was based on ignorance about what&#13;
environmental assessment is intended to do. They thought that it was going to delay everything,&#13;
rather than present options and alternatives. Sometimes it is like you donâ&#128;&#152;t want to get into it&#13;
because you may not like what will come out of it.&#13;
&#13;
This culminated, in July of â&#128;&#152;91, in a meeting called by the President, Barber Conable. And he&#13;
brought all the principals around the table, and said, â&#128;&#149;OK, talk.â&#128;&#150; So they, of course, talked about&#13;
why the new guidelines that were worked with their people should not be adopted. I had a draft&#13;
that was basically rejected by senior managers in operations. He listened to all views--the&#13;
opposition and mine. The meeting ended by him saying, â&#128;&#149;OK, Iâ&#128;&#152;ve heard everything. Iâ&#128;&#152;ll let you&#13;
know.â&#128;&#150; He had announced that he was not going to take another term, and Lew Preston was&#13;
named, but Lew [Lewis T.] Preston could not start till September. So Barber Conable agreed to&#13;
stay until August 31st. On August 31st before he left, he signed the environmental assessment&#13;
guidelines that I had proposed as is, without a change, and implementation followed.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Before moving to that, would you say thereâ&#128;&#152;s adequate consistency in the application of&#13;
these environmental assessments between the World Bank and other aid organizations, including&#13;
the Multilateral Development Banks?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: No. The Bank, even with the weak standards at that time, was still ahead of the&#13;
Multilateral Development Banks. In fact, â&#128;&#151;til today, some of them, like the EXIM [export import]&#13;
Banks, do not have environmental assessment standards. And that was another objective of mine;&#13;
the Bank as a leader on the environment, just as it is a leader on economic development.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Now, after Conable signs this, overall, what impact did Environmental Assessments (EAs)&#13;
have on project design? I mean, has there continued to be a battle with operations over this, or . .&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Well, the battle became on details in implementation. In the environmental&#13;
assessments, you classify projects as they come as proposals, either as A, where they donâ&#128;&#152;t&#13;
require any environmental assessment because itâ&#128;&#152;s an environmental project, for example, or B,&#13;
where it requires only an EA, an environmental report, so it does not involve all the great actions&#13;
related to an environmental impact statement, for example, or C, like a dam, a coal project and so&#13;
on, that requires a full-blown environmental assessment. So the fight started, then, on the&#13;
designation. If you want to avoid making an assessment, you call the project A, even though it is&#13;
going to have environmental impacts.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Even though itâ&#128;&#152;s a B or a C?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Yes. But we managed then, through a second fight that we won, to get the&#13;
Environment Department to be the one that has the final say on whether itâ&#128;&#152;s A or B or C. So they&#13;
propose it to the Environment Department, and then the Environment Department either signs off&#13;
on their designation, or says, â&#128;&#149;No way. This is going to be a major project.â&#128;&#150; Then the third battle&#13;
involved who ought to see that environmental impact or statement or report after it has been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Mohamed T. El-Ashry&#13;
                                May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
done. While they would let us see a summary, they did not want to show us the whole report.&#13;
Why? Because they claim that it belongs to the government, and unless we get the government&#13;
authorization, we cannot see it. And I said, â&#128;&#149;Yes, this is Bank money, Bank projects, and itâ&#128;&#152;s the&#13;
Bank that helps prepare it, and I can imagine, even if there is a need for a clearance from the&#13;
government, you go and get it. You donâ&#128;&#152;t say, â&#128;&#151;I cannot get it because theyâ&#128;&#152;re not going to give it&#13;
to us.â&#128;&#152;â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
And that became the other issue with NGOs on the outside. The NGOs wanted transparency,&#13;
wanted full disclosure. We talked about disclosure earlier. They wanted disclosure, so of course&#13;
that became a good excuse because if they, in operations, show it to us then they would have to&#13;
show it to anybody else--one step, one increment--if they donâ&#128;&#152;t show it to the Environment&#13;
Department, then the NGOs cannot see it, and of course I was not going to sit quietly and accept&#13;
that. The Environment Department is part of the Bank. In addition, I was reporting to the Board&#13;
regularly on the guidelines and their implementation. I needed to have the full picture. So that&#13;
became the next fight, the disclosure of these assessment reports, and eventually we won it as&#13;
well.&#13;
&#13;
And that became the beginning of public disclosure of Bank reports. It started with a small room&#13;
in the J building on the side thatâ&#128;&#152;s in the back now of the InfoShop, where someone would be&#13;
sitting there, and people, mainly NGOs, would come and look at the environmental assessments.&#13;
&#13;
Q: In your opinion, how difficult is it to ensure compliance with international environmental&#13;
instruments using the Environmental Assessments as a vehicle?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Well, if they are done right and in good faith, they can actually go a long way to&#13;
ensure such compliance. The Bank did not need to reinvent the wheel. Already the OECD&#13;
[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development] countries, the U.S. and others, had&#13;
demonstrated that, and actually a number of developing countries with the help of the United&#13;
Nations have started to move seriously in that direction. But the issue was always, â&#128;&#149;Is that&#13;
something thatâ&#128;&#152;s needed? Is that cost effective?â&#128;&#150; The whole notion of environmental externality,&#13;
in the mind of economists, is something that somebody else pays for and not as an inherent part&#13;
of the project itself and its cost. And, â&#128;&#151;til today, the implementation of these environmental&#13;
assessment guidelines is not perfect, and cannot be taken as a given. There is an implementation&#13;
review for the Board--not every year, but every two or three years--and still there are problems&#13;
being reported. Acceptance of the environment in general and environmental assessment as a&#13;
tool to addressing the environment is not universal among Bank staff.&#13;
&#13;
Q: In January 1993, as a result of the â&#128;&#152;92 reorganization, also referred to as fine-tuning, the&#13;
Bank established a central vice-presidency for Environmentally Sustainable Development,&#13;
increasingly consulting with NGOs as it became more involved in the social aspects of&#13;
development. Having said that, please discuss, first, how this impacted your work and, secondly,&#13;
your role in institutionalizing social development in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Well, I think as a preface to the answer to the question, one has to go back about&#13;
six or seven months to the Rio Earth Summit in June of 1992. That was a very important&#13;
milestone for the Bank and, eventually, for some of the changes that took place in the Bank&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Mohamed T. El-Ashry&#13;
                                May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
reorganization and otherwise. The Environment Department played a major role in setting the&#13;
agenda of the Bank for the Rio Summit. And you can say that it was truly the wish of the&#13;
shareholders, the OECD countries that stood behind the Earth Summit and its agenda, and&#13;
wanted the Bank to deliver. I think that is a simple way of putting it.&#13;
&#13;
The Bankâ&#128;&#152;s World Development Report on the environment was in preparation when I joined in&#13;
â&#128;&#152;91, but it was under the auspice of the Chief Economist not the Environment Department. It&#13;
shows you how weak the Environment Department was and the kind of respect that it had inside&#13;
the Bank. So, of course, when I came I was told, â&#128;&#149;You have to start getting involved and that it&#13;
will be a joint effort.â&#128;&#150; So I participated in some of the workshops for people who have prepared&#13;
background papers and so on. Eventually, I was shown the first draft, and it truly was a disaster&#13;
from an environmental point of view. It reflected the economist notion on how the environment&#13;
should be dealt with; if you get the policies right, everything is all right. Well, it doesnâ&#128;&#152;t work&#13;
that way in the real world. You have to have standards and regulations, and you have to have&#13;
targeted policies for the environment because itâ&#128;&#152;s still a free good. If you donâ&#128;&#152;t, who is going to&#13;
worry about the global commons or the public commons and so on? So I talked to senior&#13;
management and I said, â&#128;&#149;This is not going to fly. In fact, itâ&#128;&#152;s going to hurt the image of the&#13;
Bank,â&#128;&#150; and senior management agreed. I became involved then in the process of rewriting a&#13;
good part of that World Development Report, and it eventually became one of the best&#13;
documents. Not just because of my involvement; there were other voices within the Bank who&#13;
were ignored and who became also involved.&#13;
&#13;
The WDR became the flagship for the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s participation in Rio, and I headed the Bank&#13;
delegation to Rio, and of course, Mr. Preston came and spoke at the plenary there. But there were&#13;
a number of things that happened around that time as well, in terms of the speech of Lew Preston&#13;
in Rio. In fact, when you look at books that have been written in terms of analysis of what&#13;
happened at the Earth Summit, they credit his statement to the success of the summit in the sense&#13;
that there was complete disagreement between the developing and the developed countries on&#13;
Chapter 20, which is the finance chapter. Here I proposed, and they accepted--Senior&#13;
Management, that is--that in the next IDA replenishment, there would be what would be called&#13;
the Earth Increment, which is like an Environment Fund within IDA, of three billion dollars. So&#13;
there would be a replenishment of $14, $15 billion for IDA, and an additional three billion,&#13;
which is not really that much. Of course, we had the GEF [Global Environment Facility] at the&#13;
other end, which was also another part of that agenda in Rio, and we would be able to then co-&#13;
fund between the GEF and the Earth Increment in the sense that you are dealing with both the&#13;
local environmental problems and the global environmental problems in one big package. And&#13;
that was included in his speech, and that turned the tide. An agreement was reached, and the&#13;
World Bank became a hero for contributing positively to the success of the Rio summit. At the&#13;
same time, the GEF was accepted, and thatâ&#128;&#152;s another story to address when we get to the GEF.&#13;
But the GEF was accepted, which was very important also, and in fact some of the headlines&#13;
afterwards said: â&#128;&#149;The World Bank Rioâ&#128;&#152;s Biggest Winner.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
When we came back to Washington, it became a matter of how do we follow up then on the&#13;
World Development Report. Is it just a report, or is it really a commitment for how to do things&#13;
better? And actually, the atmosphere inside the Bank this time was different from that during the&#13;
discussion on environmental assessment. Weâ&#128;&#152;re talking now about water resources management,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
weâ&#128;&#152;re talking about forest management--efforts where the investment of the World Bank will&#13;
help the countries and will also help the environment. So it was a very good cooperative&#13;
atmosphere. But by then also, more environmental specialists had been hired in the regions to&#13;
complement whatâ&#128;&#152;s happening in the Environment Department itself, and the reorganization and&#13;
establishment of a vice presidency for environmentally sustainable development became the&#13;
initial step for the Bank to follow up on the Rio agenda. The social aspect was really a&#13;
recognition from the beginning of the link between people and the environment.&#13;
&#13;
When I took over as Director of the Environment Department, I asked that Michael Cernea, who&#13;
was the Bank guru on social science and social policy, to join the department. He was in&#13;
agriculture at the time, which shows how social issues were being viewed inside the Bank at that&#13;
time--not different from the environment. Michael became my senior adviser for social policy.&#13;
We started then actually hiring people to address the social aspects of environmental assessment,&#13;
since that was the biggest tool we had. Eventually, a division was established within the&#13;
Environment Department, with Gloria Davis moving from her job as head of the environment for&#13;
ASTEN to become the first Division Chief on social policy which, eventually, after I left to the&#13;
GEF, became a department in its own right. So that was the sequencing of social concerns in the&#13;
Bank: from being associated with environmental assessment to becoming an important area of&#13;
the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s operations. And when we talked about skill mix in the Bank, it was about&#13;
environmental specialists and sociologists, and thatâ&#128;&#152;s how the number of sociologists also started&#13;
growing in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Q: OK. What led to your appointment as the Chief Environmental Adviser to the President of&#13;
the Bank in July â&#128;&#152;94?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: When ESSD [Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Development Network]&#13;
was established, before it was announced, people who knew what was going on with the&#13;
reorganization thought that I would be the Vice-President. Before the formal announcement, I&#13;
was called for a meeting with the President, who told me that I would not be the ESSD Vice-&#13;
President but that he wanted to recognize my continued leadership on the environment by giving&#13;
me a title like the Chief Economist. He said, in fact, those were his exact words, â&#128;&#149;We canâ&#128;&#152;t call it&#13;
Chief Environmentalist, not because there was something wrong with it but because others&#13;
would not view it well, so how about if we call it that?â&#128;&#150; And thatâ&#128;&#152;s how it happened, and it&#13;
basically was reflecting my continued relationship with the President--the direct line&#13;
understanding. Mr. Preston was very interested in the environment, in a serious manner, and&#13;
wanted to make changes. In all honesty, the major changes that have taken place in the Bank&#13;
towards the environment were all under Lew Preston. Some of them were not implemented, but&#13;
the decisions were made and eventually they got implemented. He is the one who stood behind&#13;
the efforts on the environment and social aspects of development and put in place all the&#13;
mechanisms that are there today.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Weâ&#128;&#152;re going to backtrack a little bit to talk about the GEF and the background to the setup of&#13;
the Global Environment Facility (GEF), in 1991, considered to be a unique partnership among&#13;
key UN agencies (UNDP [United Nations Development Programme], UNEP [United Nations&#13;
Environment Programme], and the World Bank), administered by the World Bank. Also, your&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Mohamed T. El-Ashry&#13;
                                May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
role in simultaneously serving as GEF Chairman in November â&#128;&#152;91, soon after your appointment&#13;
as Director of the Environment Department?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: OK, thatâ&#128;&#152;s a very interesting history in its own right. The fact is the idea of the&#13;
GEF actually came from us at the World Resources Institute. We were commissioned by UNDP&#13;
to do a report on financing international conservation efforts. There was great interest on the&#13;
subject because of Rio and following the recommendations of the [Gro Harlem] Brundtland&#13;
Commission. So people were talking about the gap that exists between the amount of money&#13;
thatâ&#128;&#152;s being spent on conservation and whatâ&#128;&#152;s really needed, which is huge, and what&#13;
mechanisms can be put in place to try to close that gap even a little bit. So we, at the WRI,&#13;
worked on it for a year and a half, and the report was completed in 1989, and we proposed the&#13;
establishment of the IEF, International Environment Facility. And we actually proposed that it&#13;
would be housed at the World Bank, administered by the World Bank, which did not sit very&#13;
well at all with UNDP that gave us the money in the first place to do that report, but we thought&#13;
that thatâ&#128;&#152;s what makes sense. We had two people from the Bank on the advisory council for the&#13;
study, Basil Kavalsky and Alex [Alexander] Shakow. Little did we know, after we released it,&#13;
that the Bank had been quietly putting together the idea of the GEF on the basis of our report,&#13;
which is fine. I mean, thatâ&#128;&#152;s a great credit to us. You know, we had influenced an international&#13;
institution, and it will not be just a report to sit on a shelf.&#13;
&#13;
So in 1990, I believe, it was at the Development Committee meeting, and the French proposed&#13;
the GEF, the Germans supported it, and it started to move from there with voluntary&#13;
contributions from a number of the OECD countries. When the Bank finally put together how the&#13;
GEF is going to operate and what kind of projects theyâ&#128;&#152;re going to support, they came and gave&#13;
us a presentation at the World Resources Institute (WRI). And we were very critical of what they&#13;
were proposing. We just did not think that that was going to work. It was a typical Bank&#13;
approach for regular projects, investment projects, that would not work for the environment, as&#13;
such. The criticism was also shared by many of the NGOs in town that were consulted. But the&#13;
Bank, as it usually did back then, just rammed it through, and Wilfried Thalwitz became its first&#13;
Chairman.&#13;
&#13;
So before I was hired, when I was interviewed by Wilfried Thalwitz, he actually asked me about&#13;
the GEF as well, and I told him what I thought. Just like the Environment Department, I told him&#13;
what I thought about the GEF, and what we really had in mind when we put that idea together&#13;
out there. So when I was hired, he said, â&#128;&#149;You have to work closely with me on this.â&#128;&#150; The first&#13;
GEF Participantâ&#128;&#152;s meeting actually took place a day or two before I was officially to start, and I&#13;
came and sat behind Wilfried so that I could see how the whole thing was being done.&#13;
&#13;
When Lew Preston came in September, he decided to reorganize the Bank, and he eliminated the&#13;
senior vice-presidencies and put people in different regions. Wilfried Thalwitz became Vice-&#13;
President for Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, and as a result, the position of the Chairman&#13;
became vacant. So people suggested to Lew Preston, â&#128;&#149;Here is whatâ&#128;&#152;s-his-name, here is whatâ&#128;&#152;s-&#13;
her-name,â&#128;&#150; but he said, â&#128;&#149;Nope. The person who heads the environment heads the Global&#13;
Environment Facility. The word â&#128;&#151;environmentâ&#128;&#152; in GEF is there for a reason; it has to be the same&#13;
person.â&#128;&#150; So that was before the establishment of the ESSD vice-presidency. So I took over the&#13;
chairmanship actually starting in September, but it did not become official until November when&#13;

In the first Participants meeting that I chaired, I told them point-blank that this animal, the GEF&#13;
pilot, would not fly: â&#128;&#149;It is supposed to be helping developing countries address global&#13;
environment, and theyâ&#128;&#152;re rejecting it. Theyâ&#128;&#152;re saying, â&#128;&#151;We donâ&#128;&#152;t want it.â&#128;&#152; You basically have a&#13;
private club of 28 or 29 countries, with six or seven developing countries, the rest are OECD&#13;
countries and everybody has to pay, in fact, four million SDRs to join. And where is the rest of&#13;
the world where the bio-diversity lies and so on, so itâ&#128;&#152;s not going to fly.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
So they said, â&#128;&#149;OK, tell us how it should be.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
We wrote then the first options paper called The GEF Beyond the Pilot Phase, because the pilot&#13;
is pilot and you need to end it as fast as possible and start dealing with a new organization. And&#13;
on the basis of the paper, negotiations started with a larger number of developing countries&#13;
participating. The majority of the developing countries at the time were arguing for the so-called&#13;
Green Fund, which would be for the environment in the developing countries. The notion was&#13;
rejected by the OECD countries. So if there was no money, then you wonâ&#128;&#152;t have a fund.&#13;
Reluctantly, a number of developing countries started joining the negotiations--reluctantly and&#13;
suspiciously. As negotiations progressed, they saw that there is serious interest among OECD&#13;
countries in restructuring and that there would be real money in it and not just a little bit of&#13;
voluntary contributions like in the pilot. In April of 1992, two months before Rio, there was an&#13;
agreement with 78 or 79 countries--the majority of them, of course, are developing countries--on&#13;
how the GEF would operate in the future beyond the pilot phase.&#13;
&#13;
In Rio, when ultimately all the negotiations were completed, the GEF proposals were accepted as&#13;
is with the addition of four words, â&#128;&#149;without imposing new conditionalities.â&#128;&#150; That was the only&#13;
language that was added to what we presented as the proposal for the GEF.&#13;
&#13;
Once it was accepted and became part of Agenda 21, we started the process of negotiating the&#13;
restructured GEF, which took 18 months, and became final in March of 1994 with the first&#13;
replenishment of $2 billion. And then there was a decision that needed to be made. It had to be&#13;
independent from the Bank with an independent head that reports directly and only to the&#13;
governing Council. So it was either I stay with the Bank as the Environment Department&#13;
Director or I leave and become the first CEO and Chairman, and I decided to do the latter.&#13;
&#13;
Q: In discussing the development of the GEF, what role did the NGOs play in its evolution, I&#13;
mean, relative to other forces at work?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: They were very active, but at the same time they really were supportive of the&#13;
direction that it was taking, and they contributed to it as well. We always convened an NGO&#13;
consultation before the Participantsâ&#128;&#152; meetings, and this in itself actually evolved into a very&#13;
interesting process. As I was telling the NGOs one day here before the Council meeting three&#13;
weeks ago, reminding some of the new ones, â&#128;&#149;You used to meet before the Participants&#13;
Assembly, and you would have a statement and someone would go to the Participants Assembly,&#13;
give the statement and would walk right out. Then the next meeting, it became two people that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Mohamed T. El-Ashry&#13;
                                May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
came and gave a statement, divided between the two of them, and walked out. The next time, we&#13;
let you sit after you gave your statements, and then that eventually led to the admission of NGOs&#13;
as observers for the first time in a financial institution, and not only as observers sitting and&#13;
watching but actually making interventions in the deliberations of the governing Council itself.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
So they had a major role to play, and I think also that without their support, it would have been&#13;
difficult to get support from the U.S. for the new structure. The U.S. was to be the number one&#13;
contributor to the fund.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Let me ask also about your serving as special adviser to the Secretary General of UNCED&#13;
[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]. How did that work, and what&#13;
relationship did that role have on the furtherance, really, of the GEF?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Well, actually it started before I came to the Bank, when I was at the World&#13;
Resources Institute. And the reason for it was really a simple one. Maurice Strong had a very&#13;
small staff as the Secretary General for the summit. Part of his tremendous ability and creativity&#13;
was in targeting people who have knowledge of the subject on sustainable development, and&#13;
environment and development, to help in preparing the agenda for the summit, and the&#13;
documents for the negotiations themselves, because it was preparatory committees one after the&#13;
other, and you needed to draft documents with proposals that eventually become included in&#13;
Agenda 21. So thatâ&#128;&#152;s how it started when I was on the outside, and then I continued after joining&#13;
the Bank, not really by attending meetings anymore because I had my hands full, but through&#13;
individual meetings with him, with the Secretary General on specific subjects.&#13;
&#13;
So one of the subjects, for example, was when we were internally discussing the earth increment.&#13;
In fact, he had come up with the idea, but he didnâ&#128;&#152;t know how it could be done. So I proposed&#13;
that it would be done through IDA, and I presented it to Senior Management in the Bank. So, it&#13;
was really in that context that the relationship continued, from purely technical, when I was with&#13;
the World Resources Institute, to strategic after moving to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Q: OK. Weâ&#128;&#152;ve talked a little bit about moving GEF from a pilot to a permanent program and&#13;
what this entailed for the GEF and for you as its Chairman. In 1994, you described GEF&#13;
governance as â&#128;&#149;a unique blend of U.N. and Bretton Woods practices.â&#128;&#150; In retrospect, has this&#13;
model worked well for the GEF in that it remained attached to the Bretton Woods institutions&#13;
and not to UNEP or the UNDP?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Itâ&#128;&#152;s definitely an interesting idea, and I donâ&#128;&#152;t believe the world, so to speak,&#13;
would have backed the establishment of a new institution at that time. So having a hybrid&#13;
organization that brings UN and Bretton Woods approaches together seemed like the right idea,&#13;
in the sense that the UN in general emphasizes process and the Bretton Woods emphasize action.&#13;
But you canâ&#128;&#152;t really have action without the process, and thatâ&#128;&#152;s why the Bretton Woods&#13;
institutions always get criticized for lack of consultative approaches, lack of a representation by&#13;
developing countries even though theyâ&#128;&#152;re determining their fate with macroeconomic policy&#13;
proposals and so on. So this was a very interesting combination that brings the process and the&#13;
action together, and of course brings the only environmental organization in the world, UNEP,&#13;
into that effort as well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Mohamed T. El-Ashry&#13;
                                May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Initially, it was a World Bank organization, but the restructuring has made it a partnership and&#13;
also independent from the Bank. Yet, the Bank plays three important roles. Trustee (and that&#13;
reflects the answer to your question), being a financial institution, thatâ&#128;&#152;s where the trust fund&#13;
would be established and the money would be managed with some accountability on how the&#13;
money is being spent and so on. The second role is being an implementing agency just like&#13;
UNDP and UNEP except here for investment projects since thatâ&#128;&#152;s the specialty of the Bank. So&#13;
as a result, the majority of the money, more than 50 percent, is committed through World Bank&#13;
activities on the investment side. UNDP deals with technical assistance and capacity building,&#13;
and UNEP addresses the scientific aspects of the effort itself. And the third role for the Bank is&#13;
in servicing the secretariat, in the sense that we are housed in a Bank building, we pay the rent,&#13;
they negotiate the leases. We also donâ&#128;&#152;t have accountants, we donâ&#128;&#152;t have lawyers, but we pay for&#13;
the service.&#13;
&#13;
How does it work? Well, with difficulty. It is a complex structure, but we made it work, and&#13;
again, because truly of the good faith efforts of individuals--individuals in the Bank, individuals&#13;
in UNDP, individuals in UNEP, and individuals on the Council that wanted to make this work.&#13;
And people complain, people in the secretariat say, â&#128;&#149;Oh, do I have to live with this?â&#128;&#150; People in&#13;
the Bank say, â&#128;&#149;Why do we have to deal with a secretariat that tells us what to do and not do?&#13;
Why donâ&#128;&#152;t we just take the money and do it?â&#128;&#150; And at the same time here, the secretariat people&#13;
say, â&#128;&#149;But itâ&#128;&#152;s the GEF money. Youâ&#128;&#152;ve got to follow GEF policies and so on.â&#128;&#150; Eventually it&#13;
works out. Transaction costs perhaps are a little high, but ultimately it works and has worked&#13;
actually very well. We set the policies and the direction for the GEF itself and its activities out of&#13;
here, out of the secretariat, approved by the Council, and then implemented by the organizations&#13;
that are out thereâ&#128;&#148;the implementing and executing agencies. GEFâ&#128;&#152;s achievements on the ground&#13;
are testament to this cooperative effort.&#13;
&#13;
Q: In 1999, the GEF Council expanded opportunities for seven other agencies to work and&#13;
execute GEF projects, among others are the four Regional Development Banks, UNIDO [United&#13;
Nations Industrial Development Organization], IFAD [International Fund for Agricultural&#13;
Development], and FAO [Food and Agriculture Organization]. In dealing with multiple&#13;
constituencies such as national governments, international institutions, and private organizations,&#13;
in your opinion, how well set up is the GEF to deal with issues of inclusiveness, consensus, and&#13;
transparency?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Letâ&#128;&#152;s take it in pieces, first in terms of these executing agencies. In 1999,&#13;
recognizing that there is a new convention thatâ&#128;&#152;s being negotiated, which is the Convention on&#13;
Persistent Organic Pollutants, or POPS, and expectation--not just expectation, I mean, we were&#13;
going to fight tooth and nail to ensure that the GEF is the financial mechanism for it because the&#13;
GEF should be the financial mechanism for all global environmental conventions, old or new. So&#13;
thatâ&#128;&#152;s one.&#13;
&#13;
Second, the realization that there isnâ&#128;&#152;t really sufficient capacity in the system, in the World Bank&#13;
or the other two UN organizations, to deal with these issues of Persistent Organic Pollutants,&#13;
PCBs, DDT, and so on. So we needed to find organizations that have the capacity so that we can&#13;
go and argue that we are well-placed to implement the convention, and they donâ&#128;&#152;t say to us, â&#128;&#149;No,&#13;
but you donâ&#128;&#152;t have any capacity or knowledge of that.â&#128;&#150; So we brought FAO to deal with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Mohamed T. El-Ashry&#13;
                                 May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
agricultural chemical, and UNIDO to deal with industrial chemical. Because desertification was&#13;
going to become a bigger issue, and our view that it can be addressed more successfully through&#13;
action, small projects at the community level and so on, we felt that IFAD can help provide that&#13;
kind of expertise, having done that on the agricultural side themselves. So thatâ&#128;&#152;s as far as these&#13;
three UN organizations are concerned. But you have, then, the Asian Development Bank. The&#13;
main reason for that was when it became clear that the Bank is sort of phasing out its work on&#13;
energy, and there were very few energy projects coming to us from the Bank, and a very key area&#13;
for the GEF is climate change. So, if we donâ&#128;&#152;t have investment projects in the area of climate&#13;
change, weâ&#128;&#152;re going to run into trouble. The convention and the countries are going to say,&#13;
â&#128;&#149;Where is the money? Where are the projects? How are we going to implement the convention?â&#128;&#150;&#13;
So we wanted to very quickly fill the gap thatâ&#128;&#152;s being developed by the Bank, with the Regional&#13;
Development Banks, and thatâ&#128;&#152;s how they entered into the system. So, one is to complement the&#13;
existing capacity, and the other is actually to bring new capacity into the GEF. Inclusivity and--&#13;
what was the other one?&#13;
&#13;
Q: Consensus and transparency.&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Yeah. Letâ&#128;&#152;s take them in the reverse order. Transparency. We probably are the&#13;
only organization that makes all of its information public, including the budget, before the&#13;
Council even approves it. Everything is out there. Anyone who wants to comment and say,&#13;
â&#128;&#149;They are going to spend too much money next year in this area,â&#128;&#150; can comment on it. The&#13;
Council can take it into consideration. Having the NGOs as observers in the deliberations of the&#13;
Council, nothing is hidden. They are seeing exactly how the decisions are being taken and why&#13;
they are taken, and the give and take between developing and developed and economies in&#13;
transition on the Board itself.&#13;
&#13;
Consensus? When the GEF was restructured in â&#128;&#152;94, one of the sticky issues between north and&#13;
south was how decision-making was going to be done in the context of the Council, because you&#13;
have the Bank that deals basically on the basis of one dollar, one vote. Developing countries&#13;
didnâ&#128;&#152;t want that. They didnâ&#128;&#152;t want the donors to overwhelm decision-making and tell them what&#13;
to do in their countries related to the environment. At the same time, the donors were not going&#13;
to let the decision-making be like the UN--one country, one vote. So we came up with the idea of&#13;
a double majority system whereby, for any decision thatâ&#128;&#152;s going to be voted upon, you need the&#13;
majority of the countries and a qualified majority of the money, otherwise it does not pass. In&#13;
other words, each side is blocking the other, and youâ&#128;&#152;re not going to continue to do that. You&#13;
want to move on, so consensus is the best way to operate. In fact, the GEF instrument says that&#13;
decisions will be by consensus, but when a consensus cannot be reached, there is such a voting&#13;
system. For the nine years since it was restructured, there has not been a single vote in the&#13;
Council. Everything has been done by consensus, which, of course, moves people towards&#13;
middle ground and accommodation of each other. But, of course, the technical aspect comes&#13;
first, which is, â&#128;&#149;Is this proposal valid in its own right?â&#128;&#150; But how to implement it is where you&#13;
come into differing views in terms of strengthening this or that part and so on. So consensus has&#13;
been the means of moving forward and, in fact, it has provided both north and south negotiators&#13;
in other fora of environmentally sustainable development, with a good amount of goodwill,&#13;
having exercised that here in the GEF, for example, in the Commission on Sustainable&#13;
Development that resulted out of the Rio process itself or in the conventions, because you find&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Mohamed T. El-Ashry&#13;
                               May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
that some of the same players out there are actually operating here in the GEF as well. So I feel&#13;
very strongly that the GEF has contributed a great deal from its institutional structure and&#13;
arrangements, and its deliberations and decision-making to other institutional deliberations in the&#13;
world on environment and sustainable development.&#13;
&#13;
Inclusivity, you have it in a number of ways really. Universal membership, no fee. Like it used to&#13;
be the four million SDRs [special drawing rights]. Any country that wishes to be a member of&#13;
the GEF sends a piece of paper from the responsible minister to the CEO and Chairman saying,&#13;
â&#128;&#149;We wish to be a member.â&#128;&#150; We send them immediately a response saying, â&#128;&#149;Welcome to the&#13;
GEF family,â&#128;&#150; and they have become a member. As a result, we have now 174, more than many&#13;
UN organizations, as members of the GEF. They are represented in the Council by&#13;
constituencies. There are more seats for developing countries on the Council than for OECD&#13;
countries. There are 32 members. Sixteen are developing, 14 are developed, and two are&#13;
economies in transition. The developing country representatives belong to constituencies that are&#13;
not dictated to them. Countries choose which constituency they want to be in, and it does not&#13;
have to be an Asian country in an Asian grouping or an African country in an African grouping.&#13;
They can choose anywhere they want, and as a result, there is a rotation for the seat. And thatâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
among themselves again; they can rotate every year or rotate every two years as they choose, so&#13;
that they are represented in the decision-making itself. We facilitate consultations between&#13;
whoever is the council member and the rest of his or her constituency. Before every Council&#13;
meeting, everybody receives the documentation so that they can provide their comments and&#13;
participate in decision-making.&#13;
&#13;
Then you asked about public participation in terms of inclusivity, the way I understand it, and&#13;
thatâ&#128;&#152;s at the project level in the countries themselves. We have a very strong public policy, public&#13;
participation policy and public involvement policy in the GEF, that all organizations--the Bank,&#13;
UNDP, UNEP, FAO, whoever it is--must abide by. They translate documents for the local&#13;
communities if it is a community-based effort or indigenous peopleâ&#128;&#152;s effort, so that the people&#13;
can understand what is happening and participate in decision-making. The NGOs of the countries&#13;
and the community organizationsâ&#128;&#152; representatives are heavily involved. We have been adding&#13;
also the involvement of the scientific community in the countries themselves, so that it becomes&#13;
part of the capacity building. At least they know what is happening in their country and can&#13;
contribute to that effort, and we have a scientific and technical advisory panel that helps in&#13;
putting together that network.&#13;
&#13;
And then we have the NGO network itself. They come for the consultation before the Council&#13;
meeting. We facilitate that for them. We pay for the developing country representatives of NGOs&#13;
to come here, and OECD countries take care of themselves. And they spend a day discussing&#13;
among themselves first all the issues that are going to be before the Council, then they involve&#13;
the staff explaining to them whatâ&#128;&#152;s happening and answering questions, and then they take their&#13;
positions and come and make their presentations at the Council meeting itself.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Let me ask you, how difficult or easy was it for you as CEO and Chairman to balance the&#13;
various interests of these implementing agencies? You make it sound as if it all worked like one&#13;
of these perpetual motion machines: you get it started and it goes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Mohamed T. El-Ashry&#13;
                                May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: No. No, it doesnâ&#128;&#152;t go. It does not go without really very special attention, and not&#13;
just on the part of the CEO and Chairman but also some receptivity on the part of others. Some&#13;
things go well because they were established early on and became good practices. Like, for&#13;
example, I consult with Council members. They meet only twice a year. So you have a huge&#13;
agenda in two and a half days. I consult with them before every Council meeting. And then of&#13;
course, as you might expect, OECD countries will have certain views, and sometimes even&#13;
within OECD countries, they have differing views, and then the developing countries also have&#13;
differing views among themselves, and from the others. So I try to find the middle ground,&#13;
working middle ground, because if itâ&#128;&#152;s not workable then itâ&#128;&#152;s not worth actually pursuing. And&#13;
then I bring everybody to a lunch the day before the Council meeting, and I pick the two or three&#13;
major issues of difference, and we spend lunch--three hours--talking about this. And we try to&#13;
reach some understanding. I start by introducing it as an informal discussion, but trying to&#13;
narrow at least the gap of understanding among ourselves, and each side can explain to the other&#13;
what they really mean and so on, so it facilitates our work the next day. So without the personal&#13;
attention and making sure from the leadership position that it works, itâ&#128;&#152;s very difficult.&#13;
&#13;
And in fact, sometimes you feel like this solid thing can easily crack like a very expensive vase,&#13;
and thatâ&#128;&#152;s when youâ&#128;&#152;ve got to go around and very quickly make sure that these cracks donâ&#128;&#152;t&#13;
develop. So I will be talking to my successor about that, because of the complexity of the&#13;
structure you canâ&#128;&#152;t just let it happen by itself, because it doesnâ&#128;&#152;t. There are so many self interests,&#13;
vested interests, in the system that if you leave it alone, everyone will run in a different direction,&#13;
pulling apart rather than coming together, as we have done over the last nine years. And you&#13;
might say it is because of all of this that Iâ&#128;&#152;ve decided also not to take another term. I feel like I&#13;
have gotten it now to a point where it can move smoothly, and weâ&#128;&#152;ve closed many of the holes&#13;
and gaps that were there, and now itâ&#128;&#152;s time for someone else to do it, and I can do something else&#13;
without having to spend all of this energy and effort to make sure that itâ&#128;&#152;s working on a day-to-&#13;
day basis.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Let me ask you one last question here and then weâ&#128;&#152;ll take a little break. Speaking about&#13;
energy and effort, how well set up is the GEF in engaging the private sector and in forging&#13;
public/private partnerships? Speaking about energy expended . . .&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Yes. It has been difficult to do that, for a variety of reasons. Basically you are&#13;
dealing with governments because you are an intergovernmental body. Governments want to be&#13;
the recipients of the resources. Governments, particularly the least developing countries, do not&#13;
trust the private sector. There isnâ&#128;&#152;t really much investment there. When we talk about foreign&#13;
direct investment being twice or three times as much as ODA [official development assistance],&#13;
itâ&#128;&#152;s happening only in 15 countries or so. And there is a suspicion that OECD countries just want&#13;
to channel their resources through the private sector so that they can make a profit and so on. So&#13;
while no one really said it openly that way, clearly thatâ&#128;&#152;s the undercurrent.&#13;
&#13;
We submitted, I think, two papers at least, if not three, on a policy for the private sector, and&#13;
everybody danced around it, and you know what is behind it, what is being said, but no one&#13;
wants to say it up front, and the result of the whole discussion is you prepare another paper. And&#13;
when somebody tells you to prepare another paper, it means that theyâ&#128;&#152;re not prepared to take a&#13;
decision. But we were convinced that we cannot actually achieve the objectives of the global&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
environment or these conventions without strong participation by the private sector. I mean,&#13;
where is the technology in the first place? Weâ&#128;&#152;re talking about renewable energy, solar, and big&#13;
stuff. Wind and so on. It is with the private sector. So if you donâ&#128;&#152;t have the engagement of the&#13;
private sector, theyâ&#128;&#152;re not going to go very far. At the same time, you want to encourage also the&#13;
establishment and the development of private enterprises in the countries themselves, because we&#13;
felt all along that our money is small. Three billion dollars is a drop in the bucket. Ten billion&#13;
dollars: still a drop in the bucket. So you have to act as a catalyst.&#13;
&#13;
The fact that our money is grants, it can help catalyze other co-financing and mobilize other&#13;
resources. And we have been successful, actually quite successful, but there is still room for&#13;
improvement. We have committed so far over four and a half billion dollars of our own money&#13;
as grants, but that mobilized about $11.5 of other resources. Some of them are public resources,&#13;
like China borrowing from the Bank, and there is a GEF component thatâ&#128;&#152;s helping move the&#13;
whole package forward.&#13;
&#13;
The private sector was slow in coming into these partnerships, if you will, but for the last two&#13;
years we have been very aggressive, looking out for partnerships with the private sector thatâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
interested in the same thing as we are. At the same time, you find very clearly they are not&#13;
interested in our grants for themselves. But if we are dealing with Country X, what do we do and&#13;
what do they do to move the agenda forward? Very clearly (and that has been my idea for some&#13;
time) is that public resources should really help establish the climate, the environment in the&#13;
country that allows for private investment. For the big risks that exist out there: thatâ&#128;&#152;s why FDI&#13;
[foreign direct investment] is only in 15 countries; we can help buy down some of that risk. We&#13;
can help bring some guarantees into it. Thereâ&#128;&#152;s nothing new about it. Itâ&#128;&#152;s just a matter of how do&#13;
you utilize grant resources to do that, and as a result, we have now a number of actually&#13;
important projects in the portfolio that demonstrate different modalities for addressing private&#13;
sector participation and establishing public/private partnerships with GEF money. We are&#13;
discussing right now with Shell and a number of the major energy companies that are involved in&#13;
solar and renewable energy--big partnership on that front. It probably will not be completed&#13;
before I leave, but all the pieces for it are in place for my successor to follow up on. We had a&#13;
meeting in this room just a week ago to keep that discussion moving. And thatâ&#128;&#152;s again because of&#13;
the interests of the private sector in dealing with renewable energy and important environmental&#13;
issues, not just because they make them look good, but they realize that they can make money&#13;
there too. Shell has a big division that deals with solar energy, and they have a huge plant,&#13;
probably the biggest anywhere in the world right now, built in Germany to produce solar panels.&#13;
So they need to find the market to sell it. They canâ&#128;&#152;t just produce it and sit on it. The same thing&#13;
with the wind energy companies: they want to expand their business, and they realize now is the&#13;
time to actually start moving in that direction.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Because the GEF has served as a catalyst, an agency designed to bring various groups&#13;
together, and as an innovator, monitoring and evaluation are obviously an important aspect of its&#13;
work, how adequately have the tools for evaluating and monitoring served the GEF?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Just like the GEF itself has been evolving from the pilot phase to the restructuring&#13;
and so on, so has the monitoring and evaluation effort. It did not start right at the beginning with&#13;
the GEF relying mainly on the monitoring and evaluation that the agencies have for their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Mohamed T. El-Ashry&#13;
                                May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
projects, and there was not really an overarching framework for that. So that was established&#13;
about six or seven years ago, where we have overall policies for monitoring and evaluation and&#13;
what to do with the information that comes out of it.&#13;
&#13;
Let me elaborate a little bit. In addition to just monitoring and evaluation of the activities&#13;
themselves and the role of the agencies out there, there has been also what is known as overall&#13;
performance evaluation, and that preceded the last two replenishments. So, in fact, the&#13;
replenishment itself hinged on the results of an acceptable overall performance evaluation of the&#13;
GEF in its entirety. And these were done by completely independent people with terms of&#13;
reference approved by the Council, and then a team is recruited with some knowledge, of course,&#13;
about the global environment and developing countries and so on. Then they take their time&#13;
visiting some of the countries and some of the projects, interviewing people in the agencies,&#13;
interviewing people in the secretariat, and then they write their report. And so, thatâ&#128;&#152;s a feature&#13;
that will continue before every replenishment.&#13;
&#13;
Now that the monitoring and evaluation itself in the GEF has evolved, we are moving into&#13;
making it a completely independent effort. In a way, evaluation has been independent since it&#13;
was established in relation to the Council itself, but in terms of monitoring, the unit reports to me&#13;
as the CEO and Chairman. Now the whole thing will become independent, reporting only to the&#13;
Council with only administrative support from the secretariat as such. A key aspect of it is&#13;
ensuring that the objectives of the GEF operational programs, operational strategy, and now we&#13;
have moved into strategic planning that sets priorities up front, which in a way was a step&#13;
towards the independence I was talking about. So that is now in place, and the business plan that&#13;
was submitted to the Council three or four weeks ago tackles that system in detail, not only by&#13;
setting the strategic priorities but by setting also indicative envelopes, resource envelopes for&#13;
that.&#13;
&#13;
So now youâ&#128;&#152;ve got to evaluate against these strategic priorities, are these strategic priorities&#13;
being met in implementing the activities of this replenishment, for example, and so on. But in&#13;
addition, what do you do with all that information? And so we talk about the lessons here, and&#13;
we put out notes, but thatâ&#128;&#152;s not sufficient. There must be a way of having a feedback loop of all&#13;
of these lessons into the design of the next generation of projects. The agencies must utilize&#13;
them. The agencies must show how they are utilizing these lessons learned in the design of the&#13;
next project. The secretariat, in adjusting policies in the future or addressing how the strategic&#13;
priorities ought to change and so on, must take all of this on board. But more importantly, youâ&#128;&#152;ve&#13;
got to put that out publicly in a big way, because if weâ&#128;&#152;re a catalyst, as weâ&#128;&#152;re saying we are, then&#13;
weâ&#128;&#152;ve got to help others see whatâ&#128;&#152;s being done with this money, and since this money is public&#13;
money anyway, we need to help others who are doing similar business or are planning on doing&#13;
similar business in the future, to take into consideration our experience both positive and&#13;
negative. We should not shy away from showing how a project has failed. Why did it fail? Is it&#13;
because of the policies in the countries? Is it because the design was faulty? Was it because the&#13;
money was too little, or too much sometimes? These can result in a project not actually&#13;
achieving its objective. Is it because of the lack of public consultation and public involvement?&#13;
The beneficiaries are not involved at all? There are no local benefits; itâ&#128;&#152;s only&#13;
global/environmental benefits that the people donâ&#128;&#152;t understand? So all of these must be really&#13;
shared in a big way, and that is going to take now some strengthening of the M &amp; E [monitoring&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
and evaluation] unit of the GEF, as well as providing it with additional resources to be able to&#13;
publicize and share all this information outside.&#13;
&#13;
Q: OK. Does the GEF make use of other evaluative entities? Does it monitor other evaluative&#13;
entities and derive best practices?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Well, not exactly. I mean, letâ&#128;&#152;s look at it from two perspectives. One is that every&#13;
agency, the Bank, UNDP, UNEP, and now the new ones, the Regional Development Banks, have&#13;
their own evaluation units. So we donâ&#128;&#152;t want to duplicate what they are doing, but what OED&#13;
[Operations Evaluation Department] is doing is looking at the projects of the Bank. They are not&#13;
looking at the projects of UNDP. UNDP is looking at that.&#13;
&#13;
So first of all, we want a uniform set of guidelines so that you donâ&#128;&#152;t have the mountains and the&#13;
valleys as far as how things are being done, or the apples and the oranges. We want whatever&#13;
unit is utilizing uniform guidelines that are GEF guidelines for the evaluation and then they look&#13;
in retrospect at the results of all of this and test against it. So we established what is called&#13;
Secretariat-Managed Project Reviews, whereby it is not just taking the information that the&#13;
agencies give us in telling us the rating--you know, this one is satisfactory, this one&#13;
unsatisfactory--this is one effort, but then you go out and test it again, and find out how your&#13;
independent evaluation matches in terms of the ratings of what OED or anybody else, or the&#13;
agencies, really says, and so on.&#13;
&#13;
These, too, are efforts that converge together to try to bring about better systems of evaluation&#13;
for the GEF projects, because the GEF is new, and the whole global/environmental business is&#13;
really new, I mean, when it started back in 1990, no one knew what a global/environmental&#13;
project ought to look like. So, as a result, people use their experience in development or in&#13;
regular environment projects to do that, learning by doing, which has truly come a long way in&#13;
terms of the quality of the activities themselves, their design, and their implementation. But there&#13;
are still some projects in the portfolio that started on the wrong foot, so to speak, and they still&#13;
are ongoing, and these are the ones that weâ&#128;&#152;re trying to correct and bring to closure.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Are GEF monitoring and evaluating efforts restricted only to environmental activities that it&#13;
sponsors?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Well, GEF monitoring and evaluation is limited to the projects that it helps&#13;
finance and does not extend to any other environmental activities. But since a good number of&#13;
the projects are really partnerships, because you have different sources of funding for it--&#13;
something we did not really mention in the beginning which was part of the whole GEF beyond&#13;
the pilot phase--what we focus on here is that you are not going to solve environmental issues&#13;
unless you are addressing the development issues as well. So thatâ&#128;&#152;s where sustainable&#13;
development becomes a very important concept. Thatâ&#128;&#152;s what we try to do. So you bring the&#13;
environment and the development together, whether itâ&#128;&#152;s at the community level, whether itâ&#128;&#152;s at&#13;
the perimeters of protected areas, or whether itâ&#128;&#152;s in urban areas. So in that sense, you have a&#13;
number of partners that are supporting the other parts of this mega-project, if you want to call it&#13;
that. Sometimes they are actually small, but itâ&#128;&#152;s multiple partners that are there, and each one is&#13;
bringing their own experience, but ultimately when you evaluate, youâ&#128;&#152;ve got to evaluate the&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
project from one side. You canâ&#128;&#152;t take that little segment of this bilateral organization and this&#13;
multilateral organization and the country itself and so on and say, â&#128;&#149;This is the GEF piece. Weâ&#128;&#152;re&#13;
only going to evaluate this.â&#128;&#150; You evaluate the whole project, and as a result, you see how the&#13;
partnership is working. You see how the different pieces are working together in that or the other&#13;
particular project.&#13;
&#13;
Q: In terms of GEFâ&#128;&#152;s monitoring efforts, specifically, when it comes to implementing&#13;
environmental assessments, what role does the GEF play in the case of noncompliance by either&#13;
the beneficiary or co-financier?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Thatâ&#128;&#152;s an interesting question. We made it clear from the beginning--in fact, it is&#13;
written in the instrument for the establishment of the restructured GEF--that GEF projects should&#13;
not have adverse impacts on the environment. It cannot be an environmental project that ends up&#13;
affecting adversely the environment. So thatâ&#128;&#152;s a given to start with.&#13;
&#13;
Now, since you are not really talking about building a dam and calling it renewable energy, even&#13;
though hydroelectric is a renewable energy, you are not involved in that magnitude of&#13;
environmental assessment thatâ&#128;&#152;s there. The only ones, for example, in the case of energy would&#13;
be a wind power energy project where you would want to make sure to assess the impact on&#13;
people, more than anything else, in terms of noise--just like it happened in California--in terms&#13;
of birds: how many birds are going to get killed, is this in a migratory bird sanctuary, for&#13;
example. These become some of the assessments that weâ&#128;&#152;ve done in the appraisal of the project&#13;
itself rather than preparing a whole environmental impact statement as such. So thatâ&#128;&#152;s really, in a&#13;
nutshell, whatâ&#128;&#152;s involved here, as you are not going to accept the concept in the first place if it&#13;
appears like itâ&#128;&#152;s going to have any major impact on the people or on the environment.&#13;
&#13;
And then you have the public involvement in the consultation where you would bring the&#13;
concerns of the people, in case your judgment was not absolutely correct because you are not&#13;
sitting there; youâ&#128;&#152;re still sitting in an office in Washington, D.C. For those elements of a project&#13;
that could have adverse impact, then you make sure you assess in terms of the siting of the&#13;
project itself or in terms of the design and the implementation of it.&#13;
&#13;
Q: OK. And when there is an instance of non-compliance, what does GEF...&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Well, I mean, non-compliance would be really what you are going to catch in the&#13;
monitoring and evaluation, and thatâ&#128;&#152;s why we have been moving more and more away from the&#13;
completion reports. The agencies are big on completion reports and saying, you know, this&#13;
project is successful or less-than-successful and so on, but we need to back off from there so that&#13;
when we find that something is not right, we need to make the midcourse corrections because itâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
too late by the time you wait till the project is completed. You have to ensure implementation&#13;
quality, and you have to ensure that the money is not going to be wasted at the end. It may take a&#13;
little bit more money, or it may take some change or reprogramming within the resources&#13;
themselves to be able to make the corrections. Sometimes you donâ&#128;&#152;t have to wait till mid-stream.&#13;
Depending on the project itself, it can be actually done at an earlier stage of that, and thatâ&#128;&#152;s what&#13;
SMPRs, or Secretariat-Managed Project Reviews, are intended to do.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                    22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There is actually an additional factor here. If you have good relations, consultative relations, with&#13;
NGOs, I always believe that NGOs are the eyes and ears of an organization like the GEF. They&#13;
are going to let you know, because they are the ones out there on the ground on a daily basis, and&#13;
they can see if something is going terribly wrong and theyâ&#128;&#152;re going to complain to you--and we&#13;
have had a number of cases like that--not because the agencies of the GEF are noncompliant, but&#13;
the country itself. There are two examples where they started a pipeline thatâ&#128;&#152;s running either&#13;
close or in the middle of the protected area. Well, thatâ&#128;&#152;s a violation, and we said immediately,&#13;
â&#128;&#149;We are not going to complete the project if you continue, because then it is not a protected&#13;
area.â&#128;&#150; Itâ&#128;&#152;s an open area, and we wouldnâ&#128;&#152;t have known anything about it if the NGOs had not&#13;
really contacted us and contacted the World Bank or UNDP at the same time and said, â&#128;&#149;Look&#13;
whatâ&#128;&#152;s happening to your project. How can you call that a protected area when they are either&#13;
going to mine or extend the pipeline into that area?â&#128;&#150; Thatâ&#128;&#152;s the other factor thatâ&#128;&#152;s actually the&#13;
most important, in my mind, because now we have over 1,000 projects. You cannot go out and&#13;
monitor and evaluate every single project beyond what the agencies themselves are doing in&#13;
terms of completion reports and so on. You have to rely also on the local people and the local&#13;
organizations to tell you whatâ&#128;&#152;s going on.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Now, you talked about the Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP) in the setup of&#13;
the GEF. In developing and managing the portfolio of its activities, what role does GEFâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
Scientific, and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP) play in supporting GEFâ&#128;&#152;s ability to address&#13;
environmental problems?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: It was a realization from the beginning that science underpins all activities of a&#13;
global environmental entity like the GEF. Very complicated stuff, climate change, still not all the&#13;
scientists agree on everything related to it, but at least they agree on what we need to do. Bio-&#13;
diversity, still there are many controversial areas among scientists, whether protecting the species&#13;
in place or having corridors and so on; what is the right approach? So it was very important to&#13;
have that group of internationally-known scientists representing the different concerns, whether&#13;
developing or developed. Their initial involvement was actually in the establishment of the&#13;
policies and operational strategies of the GEF, before the projects were done.&#13;
&#13;
Now, of course, in the pilot phase there was no scientific and technical advisory panel. It came&#13;
later. And also there was no operational strategy. We were just going out doing projects here and&#13;
there. But STAP became one of the key elements of the restructured GEF. It started with an&#13;
operational strategy, with heavy involvement of the scientific and technical advisory panel, but&#13;
also in consultations, regional consultations, that brought together more scientists, because if you&#13;
have 15 or 20 scientists in STAP, you want to rely on their network of friends and colleagues and&#13;
acquaintances so that you multiply the sources of advice coming in. Then came the involvement&#13;
in the project phase. Now, youâ&#128;&#152;re not going to have 15 people doing all of that, so they put&#13;
together a roster of experts that had, like, 300, 500 people, maybe even more by now. I may be&#13;
wrong on one order of magnitude. It might be 2,000.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Worldwide?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Worldwide. That is made available to the agencies, so the agencies choose from&#13;
it, so that you donâ&#128;&#152;t have a bureaucratic system where that scientific panel is involved in every&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Mohamed T. El-Ashry&#13;
                                May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                       23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
project decision. It will not go anywhere, complex as it is right now. So you have that roster of&#13;
scientists, and they review it constantly to see if that person that they included is actually good.&#13;
Or is that scientist so close to one implementing agency or the other that it does not want to&#13;
critique what is there? In addition, they actually did selective reviews of complex projects.&#13;
&#13;
Now, we will not shy away from complex projects in the sense that part of being a catalyst is that&#13;
you are also a demonstrator. Youâ&#128;&#152;ve got to demonstrate things. So we are taking a risk and&#13;
demonstrating new technologies like bio-mass gasification. We helped testing of the technology&#13;
with the governments of Brazil and Sweden, and it was done with GE [General Electric&#13;
Company], and when it proved its viability, then we went into the commercialization phase. It is&#13;
technology that can help many developing countries in the future because of that tremendous&#13;
amount of bio mass waste that exists there, rather than cutting trees. So we take that risk as well,&#13;
and STAP can go and see how itâ&#128;&#152;s being implemented. We can learn from a scientific and&#13;
technical advisory panel, not just in terms of implementing against objectives because M &amp; E do&#13;
that, but they have another role. In our business, you have to have indicators, otherwise how can&#13;
you measure any of these things afterwards. So these performance indicators are not necessarily&#13;
just on the basis of how efficient the money is being spent, but also how successful you were in&#13;
addressing these complex objectives that are there. How are you going to measure it? So STAP&#13;
works closely with the M &amp; E unit in developing these performance indicators for measuring&#13;
project success, and for extracting the lessons.&#13;
&#13;
Q: You spoke of scientific uncertainty also. Please discuss how the GEF deals with scientific&#13;
uncertainty, which is an inevitable part of evolving knowledge related to global environmental&#13;
issues?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: There will always be scientific uncertainty. I mean, I always say to my people that&#13;
if everything was so certain, there would be no need for graduate schools anymore. I mean, we&#13;
find students are still doing dissertations on the same topics that were done 30 years ago, and&#13;
thatâ&#128;&#152;s because the knowledge base is expanding constantly and what we learned before and we&#13;
thought was certain actually is not all that certain because the more we learn, the more we find,&#13;
and the best example is a saying by Einstein himself when he said, â&#128;&#149;As the sphere of light&#13;
expands, so does the circumference of darkness.â&#128;&#150; It was, of course, related to space. So you have,&#13;
if you talk about the moon, if the moon was twice as big, it would be surrounded by more&#13;
darkness, even though it is all light. So thatâ&#128;&#152;s the whole notion of knowledge, and thatâ&#128;&#152;s why the&#13;
uncertainty, in this case, is a matter, really, of a level of risk. Thatâ&#128;&#152;s just how you would deal&#13;
with it, but with the clear advice of people who understand the scientific side.&#13;
&#13;
So there is a risk on investment itself: how much money will you put in something that you are&#13;
not 100 percent sure of its success? Yes, there are some uncertainties here, but how else are we&#13;
going to find the answers to them without going in there? And not necessarily in terms of the&#13;
proposed concept, but in terms of the technology itself, that there is uncertainty in the technology&#13;
itself, but how would you know unless you actually test, demonstrate the technology, and then&#13;
have the mechanisms in place to learn about and get answers to these questions of uncertainty at&#13;
the beginning? So thatâ&#128;&#152;s our way of addressing that, but at the same time STAP also helps you in&#13;
terms of tracking the new knowledge and the new advances in these subjects. We donâ&#128;&#152;t attend&#13;
every single conference of specialists on bio-diversities. We attend some, but not every one of&#13;
&#13;

                                 May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
them. So you have to know what the scientists are talking about in relation to this particular&#13;
species or ecosystem and so on, and thatâ&#128;&#152;s the knowledge that STAP brings to try to narrow that&#13;
uncertainty gap that exists out there.&#13;
&#13;
Q: How much of a role can the GEF play in mitigating risk arising from scientific uncertainty?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: By demonstrations. You need to demonstrate things. Scientists--and Iâ&#128;&#152;m one of&#13;
them--can talk as much as they want, but thereâ&#128;&#152;s only one way to show whether one is right or&#13;
wrong, and thatâ&#128;&#152;s by demonstrating it on the ground and seeing how successful, unsuccessful,&#13;
how much uncertainty, and how do you address/mitigate that uncertainty in the future, in other&#13;
words, addressing these efforts or technologies by demonstration on the ground? Sometimes&#13;
uncertainty is not just scientific, it is also in terms of a projectâ&#128;&#152;s fit within communities, with&#13;
people. I mean, everything looks very good on paper till you take it out to the people, and all bets&#13;
are off because unless you really have done your homework from the beginning, in terms of&#13;
consultations and so on, all bets are off. What you predicted in advance on a piece of paper can&#13;
end up going in a completely different direction out there, and thatâ&#128;&#152;s a level of uncertainty as&#13;
well, and risk, that you want to address and then help mitigate. And thatâ&#128;&#152;s why one of the things&#13;
that we have done in our operational thinking is that we focus first, for example, in bio-diversity,&#13;
on protected areas, and then on the buffer, where the people are. And now weâ&#128;&#152;re saying, â&#128;&#149;We&#13;
have done well enough in that area. Now weâ&#128;&#152;ve got to go into the productive landscape, where&#13;
there is important bio-diversity.â&#128;&#150; Thatâ&#128;&#152;s where the people live, operate, and make their living,&#13;
and thatâ&#128;&#152;s the sustainable use aspect of the bio-diversity, other than pure protection and&#13;
conservation.&#13;
&#13;
So you try to balance them after you have learned one thing and did it well, because if you try to&#13;
do everything at the same time, you have limited resources, human as well as financial, and you&#13;
have--just as we had in the pilot phase of the GEF that we used to criticizeâ&#128;&#148;sprinklings of&#13;
pepper on the globe. So you have a few black spots of pepper here and there, but it does not add&#13;
up to anything. Youâ&#128;&#152;ve got to know where youâ&#128;&#152;re heading, and you start really building towards&#13;
that agenda, then let others also do it.&#13;
&#13;
In other words, replication should be done by others. We should not really be doing too many&#13;
projects that are the same. Of course, you want to test projects in different geographic areas&#13;
because what might be successful in Africa might not be in Asia because the people, the culture,&#13;
and the politics are different. But after that, thatâ&#128;&#152;s it. You get out of that business. You have&#13;
demonstrated it, you put out your best practices, good as well as bad practices, and have others&#13;
replicate it, and thatâ&#128;&#152;s how itâ&#128;&#152;s going to happen with organizations like the GEF or even the&#13;
World Bank. I mean, the World Bankâ&#128;&#152;s $20 billion can go nowhere if itâ&#128;&#152;s not focused here and&#13;
there. And then the private sector, the governments themselves, need to scale up as they replicate&#13;
these efforts many times before we can actually achieve global environmental improvements. So&#13;
thatâ&#128;&#152;s the catalyst approach again, but coming really from a different angle.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Can you talk about GEF activities in response to the continuing need for capacity-building in&#13;
developing countries, both on the national and regional level? In your opinion, how well&#13;
understood are GEF capabilities in recipient countries? Is there an information gap at the country&#13;
level, what do results on the ground show?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Mohamed T. El-Ashry&#13;
                                May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Well, letâ&#128;&#152;s take the second part first, because capacity-building really is much&#13;
broader in the way I want to talk about it. So letâ&#128;&#152;s take that information. Yes, there is still an&#13;
information gap. We realize that over the last nine years we have been trying to close it, but&#13;
thereâ&#128;&#152;s still really a lot to be done. And it stems from the fact that when the World Bank is doing&#13;
a GEF project, it does not say that this is a GEF project or at least people donâ&#128;&#152;t understand it to&#13;
be a GEF project, so itâ&#128;&#152;s called a World Bank project, and then UNDP the same thing, and&#13;
UNEP the same thing, because they are the ones who are out there in the countries. Now, they&#13;
may mention it but do not really give full credit to the GEF. So we have been helping improve&#13;
that by insisting that--and thatâ&#128;&#152;s after I visited a number of projects and found a big sign in front&#13;
of the project saying, â&#128;&#149;UNDP and the government of such-and-such.â&#128;&#150; Where is the GEF? I mean,&#13;
itâ&#128;&#152;s 100 per cent GEF. UNDP has nothing to do with it. They even got paid by the GEF to do the&#13;
project. So whereâ&#128;&#152;s the GEF here? And then I look at a brochure of IUCN [International Union&#13;
for Conservation of Nature] for that area, and they never mention the GEF. IUCN should have&#13;
known better. The government maybe didnâ&#128;&#152;t, but IUCN should have known better, and thatâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
really what starts us saying, â&#128;&#149;No way. Weâ&#128;&#152;ve got to do something more to help improve the&#13;
information base out there.â&#128;&#150; So it is better but it is not perfect, and itâ&#128;&#152;s not really going to be&#13;
perfect â&#128;&#151;til the implementing agencies give full credit to GEF resources in doing that. Press&#13;
releases of the World Bank would say, â&#128;&#149;The World Bank provides a grant for bio-diversity&#13;
conservation in Country X.â&#128;&#150; And then, way down near the bottom of the page hidden&#13;
somewhere, â&#128;&#149;$10 million of that is a GEF grant.â&#128;&#150; So now we have been working with them to&#13;
have it in the headline and then even in the first paragraph, and still every once in a while,&#13;
someone new comes to EXT [External Affairs] and doesnâ&#128;&#152;t understand; they leave GEF out. So&#13;
we insisted that any press release for a GEF project should come to us for review. Sure enough,&#13;
they got a call two days ago. A project press release thatâ&#128;&#152;s going to come out from the Bank does&#13;
not mention the GEF in the headline, so we added it. Ultimately, it will have to be codified&#13;
somehow.&#13;
&#13;
Thatâ&#128;&#152;s what we did with Human Resources because we have some special situations, and the&#13;
same thing with signing authority. The CEO [chief executive officer] should be signing on behalf&#13;
of the GEF. So youâ&#128;&#152;ve got a young lawyer that tells you, â&#128;&#149;No, no, no. Why is there an exception&#13;
for the GEF?â&#128;&#150; Because they really think it is part of the Bank, and they are not going to go read&#13;
and understand. That has been our struggle, constantly, on how to correct the perceptions out&#13;
there based on what the implementing agencies did on the ground in not giving credit to the&#13;
GEF. There is the press, sometimes a number of articles refer to the GEF as the World Bankâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
Global Environment Facility. So as I said, itâ&#128;&#152;s a struggle. We have our own publications, and the&#13;
latest one is a picture book of GEF projects. It only talks about the partnership with the agencies,&#13;
but does not include anywhere a mention of the World Bank, UNDP, and so on, which they insist&#13;
on, and I said, â&#128;&#149;No.â&#128;&#150; This is not how the GEF will have a corporate identity. I think itâ&#128;&#152;s going to&#13;
require actually, in the project agreement itself, a phrase or a paragraph that talks about how the&#13;
GEF will get credit for that, so that it is part of the legal document itself. So thatâ&#128;&#152;s the part about&#13;
the information gap, and the thing is that it is the item that receives the least budget support. I&#13;
&#13;
n fact, initially the reason it took so long to get the situation corrected is that when I proposed it&#13;
early on, I had two major governments say, â&#128;&#149;What do you need that for?â&#128;&#150; and insisted on taking&#13;
it out of the budget because the World Bank will take care of that, and UNDP will take care of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Mohamed T. El-Ashry&#13;
                                 May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
that, and UNEP will take care of that. So of course, when we demonstrated to everybody that&#13;
actually the GEF was not getting credit and as a result is not known out there in the field in many&#13;
countries, they started to give the budget for external affairs, and we doing better, but still need&#13;
to improve more.&#13;
&#13;
On capacity building, this is a very important topic in my mind, and I and many other people&#13;
have written about it over the 25 to 30 years. Whenever one talks about a project failure or a&#13;
policy failure, immediately you say, â&#128;&#149;Itâ&#128;&#152;s because of weak institutions and lack of capacity in the&#13;
country.â&#128;&#150; â&#128;&#151;Til today, itâ&#128;&#152;s still being written about this way. So what in the world happened to the&#13;
billions and billions of dollars that have been spent over the last 25 years under the guise of&#13;
capacity building? And the answer is simple. It went into workshops and seminars and many&#13;
foreign consultants traveling around the world at a high price and did not build systematically a&#13;
lasting capacity in the country. So, I thought, as a catalyst again, why canâ&#128;&#152;t we put something on&#13;
the right track, and see if we can help influence what happens at least in capacity building for the&#13;
environment and sustainable development, ways to bring environment into development itself.&#13;
So we embarked upon, with the support of the Council, an 18-month exercise, very participatory,&#13;
so that people could tell us, â&#128;&#149;What do they mean by capacity building? What should be involved&#13;
in capacity building? How should it be done?â&#128;&#150; And so on. And we came out with an action plan,&#13;
back in May of 2002. It had two parts to it. One aspect is providing for capacity need&#13;
assessments, so that the countries themselves can assess what their needs are and tell us, rather&#13;
than us going and prescribing, â&#128;&#149;Hereâ&#128;&#152;s what you need. Hereâ&#128;&#152;s what weâ&#128;&#152;re going to give you,â&#128;&#150;&#13;
and then an action plan once you determine what the needs are, and how to go about actually&#13;
implementing and supporting it.&#13;
&#13;
Well, that second part got caught in the politics of the preparation for the World Summit for&#13;
Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, and some of the donors felt that there are still so&#13;
many things that are being negotiated with the developing countries, and capacity building was&#13;
an important item, so why give away one of their bargaining chips by agreeing to that effort in&#13;
the GEF now. Why donâ&#128;&#152;t we wait till we see whatâ&#128;&#152;s happened. Well, sure enough, capacity&#13;
building came out as a very important outcome of the WSSD, and we have carried the ball&#13;
forward when we put out the latest business plan with the strategic priorities.&#13;
&#13;
We gave capacity building a very high priority. I wanted to go for 30 percent of all funds of the&#13;
GEF that should be spent on capacity building, but we went with 25 percent so that we donâ&#128;&#152;t lose&#13;
some key Council members. So we have managed to educate them at the level of 25 percent, but&#13;
the plan will not be finalized until November with the next meeting of the Council. Capacity&#13;
building the way we are describing it should happen in really three or four different ways.&#13;
Straightforward institutional capacity building, in terms of environment agencies which are the&#13;
weakest--just like the Environment Department was in the Bank the weakest unit there--the&#13;
ministry of environment or the environment agency is the weakest ministry or the weakest&#13;
institution in any developing country. So we need to strengthen these people if they are going to&#13;
keep an eye on the things that are happening in that country, if you are going to have people&#13;
advising the other ministries on how to incorporate the environment into sustainable&#13;
development, if they are going to have legitimacy and credibility within their own country.&#13;
Because in my view, again, if I am a Minister of Finance or if I am the President of a country, I&#13;
am not going to listen to an NGO from Washington or from an expert from the north telling me I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Mohamed T. El-Ashry&#13;
                                May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ought to do it this way. Risking my whole economy, my whole development and economic&#13;
development is in the balance here. So, I need people that I can trust within my country to&#13;
provide that advice to me. So thatâ&#128;&#152;s one, institutional capacity.&#13;
&#13;
The second one is within the project itself, which we have been doing, and that is to have a&#13;
capacity building component for managerial capacity building or for whatever the needs are&#13;
based on the project itself.&#13;
&#13;
And then the third would be capacity building for the focal areas of the GEF, like you have to&#13;
have at least one biodiversity specialist in your country if youâ&#128;&#152;re going to deal with that and one&#13;
climate change or energy climate change which is nothing really more than energy. You need&#13;
specialists, clean energy specialists, in your country to deal with that; someone who understands&#13;
about how to analyze the emissions in the country. I mean, the whole idea is that we want them&#13;
to contribute to reducing the emissions of carbon dioxide, but if they donâ&#128;&#152;t know how to go and&#13;
measure it in the first place, how can we expect that to happen there? So thatâ&#128;&#152;s how we really see&#13;
institutional and capacity building, within the project, or in the focal areas themselves.&#13;
&#13;
Q: OK. Thatâ&#128;&#152;s within the countries. So what happens at the regional level?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Well, at the regional level, OK. Ecosystems, of course, donâ&#128;&#152;t recognize&#13;
geographic boundaries, so most of them, the majority of them, are regional rather than national,&#13;
unless you are dealing with a huge country like Brazil, for example. And in that case, itâ&#128;&#152;s very&#13;
important to share the experience. First of all, there are regional projects. Like, the Meso-&#13;
American biological corridor; weâ&#128;&#152;ve got most of the countries of Central America in them&#13;
because you could not just do a project in one country and ignore the others. They are all&#13;
connected out there. We came out with an operational program on integrated ecosystem&#13;
management, which is becoming one of the most popular operational programs in terms of&#13;
funding because it brings also linkages between different areas, not only the regional perspective&#13;
but also the linkage between bio-diversity, climate change, water resources, and land&#13;
degradation. And then in regional projects like that, you are going to have the capacity building&#13;
component so that you can bring the experts from the different countries not only to agree on&#13;
what is going to happen, but also beyond that in terms of how they are going to carry out the&#13;
work in their own country.&#13;
&#13;
The same thing happens in international waters. What we call international waters is really no&#13;
more than regional waters. Dealing with a river basin or a lake and so on, like the biggest one&#13;
now that we have, the Black Sea and the Danube, where all the countries that are in that river&#13;
basin worked together to come up with an action program, strategic action program. So it started&#13;
with, first of all, sitting around the table, facilitated by the GEF through its implementing&#13;
agencies, and then funds spent for bringing the technical information. We are talking here about&#13;
a polluted water body: Where is the pollution coming from? How much is coming from where?&#13;
Because you need this information before you can start talking about how you are going to clean&#13;
it up. And, in some cases, there is a weakness in the countries in collecting this data, or the data&#13;
is diffused in different areas, and you have to help bring it together, and in the process you are&#13;
again building the capacity of the people there. And once there is an agreement on the strategic&#13;
action plan, then comes its implementation in terms of what technology, in what country, how&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Mohamed T. El-Ashry&#13;
                                May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 28&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
itâ&#128;&#152;s going to be funded, and that brings now a bigger community within the countries and the&#13;
regions to deal with the action. Then you leave behind a body, a regional body, thatâ&#128;&#152;s going to&#13;
monitor how all of that is happening because once the project is finished, we walk away and they&#13;
have to take over from that point on. Same thing with the Nile basin initiative, dealing again with&#13;
all the riparian countries of the basin, and the beginning of it, most of the time, is really a&#13;
capacity building effort at the regional level, and then from there you focus on or target the&#13;
national level capacity in this or that country, depending on the level of weakness that exists.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Is there anything else you wish to add to that before we move on?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: No.&#13;
&#13;
Q: GEFâ&#128;&#152;s focal area programs (ozone, climate change, bio-diversity, international waters, and&#13;
land degradation) are linked to the objectives of global environmental conventions. In your&#13;
opinion, how well does the GEF, as the major source of funding for programs specifically&#13;
supporting international environment agreements, serve the objectives of these conventions?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Without funding--and in this case the majority of it comes from the GEF--these&#13;
agreements would have had the same fate of hundreds of their predecessors that ended up&#13;
collecting dust on shelves, never been implemented, because developing countriesâ&#128;&#152; priorities are&#13;
mainly education, health, poverty alleviation, etc. The environment has not been really a major&#13;
priority at the national level, so imagine now when you come to them and tell them, â&#128;&#149;We want&#13;
you to contribute also to global environmental improvement.â&#128;&#150; Itâ&#128;&#152;s not a priority. So if you donâ&#128;&#152;t&#13;
have finance associated with it, youâ&#128;&#152;re not going to go very far, and that was recognized in the&#13;
case of the ozone when the Multilateral Fund for ozone was put together in conjunction with the&#13;
Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol. And in a way you can say that because of the&#13;
success of that, the effort on ozone helped actually looking at these other issues of climate&#13;
change, bio-diversity, land degradation, and so on, as well as the GEF as the financial&#13;
mechanism for all of these environmental conventions. We have, of course, ozone, but only for&#13;
the economies in transition and the Soviet Union--the former Soviet Union and Russia--that do&#13;
not qualify for the Montreal Protocol Fund. The Montreal Protocol Fund is only for developing&#13;
countries so there is that gap, which is a huge gap in terms of the production and the phase out in&#13;
these economies in transition. The GEF then supports that, and that actually is a major area of&#13;
our success, in that theyâ&#128;&#152;re all on track to phase out in an even less amount of time than they&#13;
were supposed to. But is it enough? And the question comes back. What can you really do to try&#13;
to implement all of these efforts?&#13;
&#13;
And I think one aspect of bringing finance is also bringing awareness to a country. A country&#13;
like Bangladesh may say, â&#128;&#149;What is it that I should really be doing about climate change? The&#13;
U.S. does not reduce its emissions; what can I do?â&#128;&#150; But the fact is, with sea level rising, a good&#13;
part of the country is going to disappear. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the droughts that have happened&#13;
before will be very much exacerbated as climate change continues. So unless one recognizes,&#13;
then, the impact on themselves is also going to be great, and then they will have to become part&#13;
of that global partnership for addressing the global environment, the money of the GEF by itself&#13;
is not enough. So the money of the GEF is to help show them the way for addressing, in this&#13;
case, adaptation. How do they adapt? Because weâ&#128;&#152;re not going to reverse what happened already&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                  29&#13;

&#13;
in terms of global warming. Itâ&#128;&#152;s there and itâ&#128;&#152;s going to happen. Itâ&#128;&#152;s a matter of how far and when&#13;
do we stop it rather than reversing it, because you are not going to reverse it. So how to adapt to&#13;
these things; thatâ&#128;&#152;s part of what we can show. We cannot go and help every country build the&#13;
structures that will help them adapt, sea walls or monitoring systems and so on, but we can&#13;
demonstrate in a number of areas that effort.&#13;
&#13;
Because of the confidence that the international community has now in the GEF, out of the&#13;
convention on climate change two years ago, they agreed to establish three different new funds.&#13;
And after heavy-duty debate, it was agreed that the funds would all be managed by the GEF. So,&#13;
itâ&#128;&#152;s not mixed with the GEF funds, but then you bring about the complementarity between what&#13;
the GEF funds and the Special Climate Change Fund or Adaptation Fund or the Kyoto Protocol&#13;
as they can come together to address some of these issues out there. So funding is very&#13;
important. The best real judge on that was the overall performance study, second overall&#13;
performance study, which said clearly that the GEF had major impact on the issues of the global&#13;
environment, and in supporting the global environment conventions.&#13;
&#13;
Q: OK. What conditions, if any, related to compliance, are attached to GEF funding of&#13;
environmental programs?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Well, you have to realize in the first place that the climate change convention is a&#13;
framework convention. And that, again, relates to the fact that the largest percentage of the&#13;
emissions were produced by the OECD countries. So you canâ&#128;&#152;t really talk about the developing&#13;
countries, and thatâ&#128;&#152;s the issue with the Kyoto Protocol, and thatâ&#128;&#152;s why the [George W.] Bush&#13;
administration rejected it as they want the developing countries to also have targets. But the&#13;
developing countries are saying, â&#128;&#149;Wait a second. How can I have a target now when I am at the&#13;
beginning level of development, and you have developed all the way, and you are not even doing&#13;
your part?â&#128;&#150; So as a result, it is a framework convention, and when the Kyoto Protocol ended up&#13;
addressing emission reductions, it addressed only those of OECD and not developing countries.&#13;
So there is nothing really to talk about in terms of compliance by developing countries. Their&#13;
only commitment is that they will assess the amount of emissions that they have and report it.&#13;
Thatâ&#128;&#152;s the easy part. Same thing with bio-diversity in having a strategy and action plan on bio-&#13;
diversity. But if there are no funds, they have no commitment to implement it.&#13;
&#13;
So the compliance here is really not the same, but thatâ&#128;&#152;s another issue altogether when it comes&#13;
to renegotiating the conventions in the future if we are really serious about safeguarding the&#13;
global environment, and thatâ&#128;&#152;s where there have to be firm targets, timetables, and compliance.&#13;
Even the WSSD in Johannesburg, when it addressed some of the Millennium Development&#13;
Goals related to water and sanitation, it just followed that part, but when it came to bio-diversity&#13;
and renewable energy, no target, thanks to the U.S. It did not want any targets there because it&#13;
comes back to haunt it as it is the largest actor on that front. So again, the international&#13;
community failed to set targets, timetables, and mechanisms for following up on it. So looking at&#13;
compliance is not part of our mandate because it does not really exist in the first place in terms of&#13;
commitment on that front.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q: OK. In August of 2002, donors agreed to the highest replenishment ever for the GEF, almost&#13;
three billion dollars to fund its operations over the next four years. Please discuss the challenges&#13;
facing GEF funding in light of continued decline in ODA?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: We managed to get the three billion dollars. Itâ&#128;&#152;s no longer almost; itâ&#128;&#152;s exactly&#13;
three billion with some of the voluntary contributions that have been made, and as you said, that&#13;
is the largest replenishment ever.&#13;
&#13;
Two factors contributed to it being the largest commitment, the largest replenishment. One is the&#13;
fact that you had two new conventions: persistent organic pollutants that would be now&#13;
supported by the GEF, and desertification. So we were estimating an additional 500 million, so&#13;
to speak, for these two areas. So the increase addresses that, but at the same time, it was a good&#13;
political move on our part and the part of the donors in that it was in advance of the summit, one&#13;
month before the Johannesburg summit, and of course the developing countries were arguing&#13;
vehemently about increasing ODA and increasing contribution from developed countries. So&#13;
here was a small amount of money that one can say, â&#128;&#149;Look at the GEF growing,â&#128;&#150; which now,&#13;
contrary to what happened in the pilot phase, is strongly supported and accepted by the&#13;
developing countries, and in fact, they want to protect it because it has shown its value to them&#13;
with the actions that are there. So itâ&#128;&#152;s a good political figure. Now, if you like the GEF, well,&#13;
weâ&#128;&#152;ll put a little bit more money in the GEF. Iâ&#128;&#152;m not being facetious at all. These are political as&#13;
well as, of course, the needs in terms of the two new conventions coming in there. The challenge&#13;
is the same one that we had for the last three or four years.&#13;
&#13;
Three billion dollars is great, but will it be paid, particularly by the U.S. Congress? Because over&#13;
the last three or four years, the administration would request the full amount every year from&#13;
Congress, and Congress would cut it by 60 or 80 percent, and then you build arrears. So, in came&#13;
the Bush administration recognizingâ&#128;&#147;working, of course, with the Republican Congressâ&#128;&#147;that we&#13;
need to eliminate the arrears, which was a condition of the replenishment by the other OECD&#13;
countries, as they canâ&#128;&#152;t continue to pay money while the U.S. does not pay. Another concern was&#13;
how can they sell it politically within their governments and within their countries. So the Bush&#13;
administration agreed to have a plan for paying off the arrears over three years and also make the&#13;
pledge for the new replenishment. And sure enough, that was in the Presidentâ&#128;&#152;s request. What&#13;
finally came out is short by about 37 million. So here they were to pay the arrears, and now they&#13;
have established new arrears. So thatâ&#128;&#152;s the fear. Come next year, with the budget deficit and with&#13;
every Congressman wanting a little bit more money in their district, will they even agree to a&#13;
level thatâ&#128;&#152;s equal to this yearâ&#128;&#152;s? Thatâ&#128;&#152;s the challenge. And then there was a provision that the&#13;
French introduced early on whereby basically, if the U.S. does not payâ&#128;&#147;and that was because of&#13;
the experience with the UN duesâ&#128;&#147;they can then apportion their payment accordingly, which they&#13;
did every time, and then eventually Austria, Japan, and Germany did the same thing. So two&#13;
years ago, the money that was available was only about one-third of what we should have had.&#13;
So on paper itâ&#128;&#152;s one thing and what you can actually do is something else.&#13;
&#13;
Now of course we have the new replenishment, everyone is enthusiastic and so on, and we had a&#13;
big work program for the one that took place three weeks ago. Thereâ&#128;&#152;s going to be a big work&#13;
program because the money is available. But come next year as the U.S. Congress reduces the&#13;
payment again, the other countries will match theirs and then back again to a reduced effort. So&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Mohamed T. El-Ashry&#13;
                                May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
thatâ&#128;&#152;s the biggest challenge in terms of the finances, in terms of the funding, is whether countries&#13;
that pledge certain amounts actually pay them and on time.&#13;
&#13;
Q: In light of that, in what ways does the GEF supplement its funding?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: It cannot supplement its funding in terms of fund-raising efforts with foundations&#13;
or from anywhere else. It tries to stretch the funds through co-financing, but you have to have a&#13;
base. If you donâ&#128;&#152;t have the base, you are not going to get the co-financing. So as the money is&#13;
shrinking, as the base is shrinking, so will the co-financing. Absolutely. Because if you have a&#13;
ratio like we have done so farâ&#128;&#147;and we feel that we have been very successfulâ&#128;&#147;of one to three,&#13;
which is four and a half billion to $12.5 half billion, itâ&#128;&#152;s about one dollar of GEF to three dollars&#13;
of co-finance, and if you donâ&#128;&#152;t have the one dollar, if you only have half a dollar, you are going&#13;
to get one and a half from there. So that still is part of the challenge even though we have&#13;
become successful in addressing co-financing and finding co-financiers; we still have to have&#13;
that base to start with because as it shrinks, so will our co-financing.&#13;
&#13;
Q: OK. In your opinion, should the current shift to increased spending on social development&#13;
change expectations about grants versus loans, and how might this affect funding for the GEF?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: I really think, in the context of social development and the environment, they are&#13;
the areas that have received the least attention in development assistance, in spite of all the lip&#13;
service thatâ&#128;&#152;s out there. These are the problems that we are seeing in the world: education,&#13;
health, environment, AIDS, even SARS [severe acute respiratory syndrome] right now and so&#13;
on. If SARS ever gets to other developing countries besides China, just say goodbye to many of&#13;
the things that we really know right now. I mean, AIDS, at least one started to find out what the&#13;
pathways for it are, but for SARS, no one really knows what it is right now. So the needs are for&#13;
preventive mechanisms, and I donâ&#128;&#152;t truly see grants as a handout. Unfortunately, thatâ&#128;&#152;s how&#13;
donors are viewing it, is that they are giving handouts, and as a result, they have to put all of&#13;
these conditions on it and so on. I see it as an investment in this global commons that weâ&#128;&#152;re all&#13;
part of.&#13;
&#13;
You know, we keep talking about interdependence, but interdependence means that if youâ&#128;&#152;re in&#13;
the same boat, and if one part first goes down, the other part is going to go down. So lots of lip&#13;
service. But having said that, I also appreciate the concern of the donors about the fate of these&#13;
resources, about corruption, about money being diverted to other areas and so on, but I truly&#13;
donâ&#128;&#152;t see that as an excuse for not addressing these issues in a bigger way. You can have&#13;
safeguards. I think countries have realized that if theyâ&#128;&#152;re going to get the money, they will have&#13;
to accept the safeguards that go with it. I donâ&#128;&#152;t agree with the United States at all that says, â&#128;&#149;Let&#13;
us rank the countries according to their performance, and only those high-performance countries&#13;
get the money, the others donâ&#128;&#152;t.â&#128;&#150; They are trying to do it to us now in the GEF by the way. And I&#13;
say, â&#128;&#149;Wait a second.â&#128;&#150; So for a country thatâ&#128;&#152;s not a high performer and has the one species thatâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
left in the world, we donâ&#128;&#152;t give money to save that species because they are under performers?&#13;
We should, and thatâ&#128;&#152;s what we do, actually, right now in the GEF.&#13;
&#13;
But we have the safeguards. We do the implementation through NGOs, for example. We donâ&#128;&#152;t&#13;
give the money for a trust fund and have it in the country. Itâ&#128;&#152;s offshore and being managed&#13;

                                 May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
offshore. And we get the work done for the global environment, and the work can similarly get&#13;
done for health and social development without having to put the money directly in the hands of&#13;
the government. Who is going to be against helping the poor in terms of health and education&#13;
and so on? No one. But there is a level of hypocrisy, really, out there in the world when it comes&#13;
to all of this, and itâ&#128;&#152;s hiding behind grants versus loans, itâ&#128;&#152;s hiding behind corruption versus&#13;
having mechanisms and safeguards. But if we are really serious about addressing these things the&#13;
way they should be addressed, then there are ways to do it rather than wasting all this time and&#13;
effort going through this debate that doesnâ&#128;&#152;t get us very far at all.&#13;
&#13;
And by the way, Iâ&#128;&#152;m sure you have been reading lately that for the last year or two, now the&#13;
flows of resources have reversed again, back from south to north. So what kind of poverty&#13;
alleviation is that? What kind of Millennium Development Goals are these? Thatâ&#128;&#152;s nonsense.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Thank you very much. We will conclude this session now, and then look forward to the&#13;
second session tomorrow, if thatâ&#128;&#152;s all right. Thank you very much.&#13;

                                        Washington, D.C.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q: Good morning. Today is Friday, May 30th, 2003, and this is the second day of our interview&#13;
with Mohammed D. El-Ashry. And itâ&#128;&#152;s Bill Becker and Marie Zenni here with Mr. El-Ashry.&#13;
Weâ&#128;&#152;d like to begin our session this morning by asking you about the new book, The Challenge of&#13;
Sustainability. The authors of the GEFâ&#128;&#152;s new book, The Challenge of Sustainability, published in&#13;
2002, observed that in the ten years since the Rio Summit, progress toward sustainability and&#13;
poverty alleviation has been unacceptably slow. Why in your opinion has progress been so slow?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: I think that the main reason is the lack of political will. And I would really say&#13;
political will, political will--political will has been missing. You have 110 leaders who were in&#13;
Rio. They had a very nice picture together, and they signed a declaration and Agenda 21 and&#13;
very little was done afterwards. Itâ&#128;&#152;s like, you know, this is behind us now. We go back to what&#13;
we were doing before. So that clearly is one factor.&#13;
&#13;
Another factor of course is the whole issue of finance, which is not a simple one, but clearly&#13;
sufficient finance is a factor, and I donâ&#128;&#152;t mean at all just ODA, but I mean also setting aside and&#13;
including in the budgets of the countries adequate resources to address the issues of sustainable&#13;
development and bringing the environment into development. You find that, unfortunately,&#13;
thereâ&#128;&#152;s lots of finger pointing; the developing countries hide behind the fact that ODA not only&#13;
does not increase, as was promised in Rio, but actually has shrunk in real terms, while the&#13;
developed countries hide behind the fact that there has not been much policy reform and there&#13;
have been issues of governance and so on. The world is not going to go very far this way if each&#13;
side keeps citing what are the barriers to moving forward on sustainable development and take&#13;
no action to remove them.&#13;
&#13;
Then we had of course the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, ten&#13;
years after Rio, revisiting these issues and what happened there. We ended up with 70 some&#13;
pages of an action plan which does not really come up with much of anything new other than to&#13;
repeat Agenda 21. So where were the leaders for the last ten years? Would the next ten years be&#13;
any different from the last ten years? While we see that itâ&#128;&#152;s basically the same leaders and you&#13;
wonder whether the political will now will be very much different.&#13;
&#13;
Because what concerns me really more than anything is the whole situation since September 11th&#13;
and the war on terrorism and the war in Iraq. We are going to be spending so much attention and&#13;
resources on that, and on the reconstruction of Afghanistan and Iraq. What about the other one&#13;
hundred and some countries where there are huge issues of health, environment, education and&#13;
so on? And where is the money going to come from? There were some encouraging&#13;
developments on the way to Johannesburg, for instance, at the Monterrey Summit where the U.S.&#13;
promised an additional $5 billion for development assistance that possibly could become even&#13;
$10 billion down the line. Will that money actually be put on the table for sustainable&#13;
development? Or because of budget deficits and the war, military expenses and reconstruction,&#13;
they would not be able to do that. Would the Europeans continue to do what they have done&#13;
before and what they promised if the U.S. does not deliver? As we have seen in the case of the&#13;
&#13;
                                     Mohamed T. El-Ashry&#13;
                                May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  34&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GEF, if the U.S. does not pay some of the Europeans at least and the Japanese say, â&#128;&#149;Well, weâ&#128;&#152;re&#13;
not going to pay, either, because weâ&#128;&#152;re not going to carry the full burden by ourselves.â&#128;&#150; So there&#13;
are many complicating factors now. Iâ&#128;&#152;m not at all minimizing the impact of 9/11; I said when it&#13;
happened that itâ&#128;&#152;s going to change the world as we know it for a long, long time. Very&#13;
unfortunate, very sad, very sorry situation; clearly the war on terrorism is a very important and&#13;
needed thing and can become part of the whole global cooperation that one can look at in a&#13;
different way rather than just one country dictating to the rest of the world.&#13;
&#13;
Q: What, in your opinion, are the impediments to reaching the Millennium Development Goals&#13;
(MDGs) endorsed at the UN Millennium Summit in 2000?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Again, itâ&#128;&#152;s really that question of finance, and I think the World Bank was correct&#13;
in saying, â&#128;&#149;We are not going to meet them by 2015 if at least another $50 billion is not added&#13;
immediately.â&#128;&#150; So right now itâ&#128;&#152;s $50 billion of ODA, and of course this does not go completely&#13;
towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. The way things are going right now there&#13;
is no way they would be met by 2015 at the existing level of resources.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Moving on to the World Bank presidents. How would you assess the various World Bank&#13;
presidents you served under and had to deal with, both as Bank Staff Member, and in your&#13;
capacity as Chairman and CEO of the GEF?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: I guess since itâ&#128;&#152;s part of the transcript, that is when I try to become diplomatic, so&#13;
to speak, because I truly had a great relationship with the three of them, even with Jim [James&#13;
D.] Wolfensohn . . .&#13;
&#13;
Q: Three of them, that includes Conable . .&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Barber Conable, Lew Preston and James Wolfensohn.&#13;
&#13;
Even though I donâ&#128;&#152;t work for Jim Wolfensohn because he came after I had become the CEO and&#13;
Chairman and Iâ&#128;&#152;m not accountable to him or the Bank, but we have had a great working&#13;
relationship as partners. And early on he sought my advice on whatâ&#128;&#152;s happening in the Bank on&#13;
the environment and sustainable development issues.&#13;
&#13;
So the two that I truly can talk about are Barber Conable and Lew Preston, in terms of the issues&#13;
that we addressed and the work that has been done in the Bank at that time on the environment.&#13;
Barber clearly was committed to improving the environmental actions of the Bank and he&#13;
demonstrated that by going outside the Bank and seeking to hire someone like me who can make&#13;
the change, and I think approving the Environmental Assessment Guidelines on August 31st&#13;
before he lef, is a clear demonstration of that. Iâ&#128;&#152;m sorry I did not get to work longer with him to&#13;
really know how he thinks about all of these issues and help him in addressing them.&#13;
&#13;
Lew Preston does not get much credit for whatâ&#128;&#152;s really happening in the Bank, of how far the&#13;
Bank has come on the issues of environment and social policy, but everything that exists in the&#13;
Bank right now was put in place at the time of Lew Preston. He was a quiet man, a very&#13;
honorable man. He did not say much, but when he spoke it was about decisions, about action,&#13;

&#13;
and not wasting too much time debating them. He listened very carefully and listened to all sides.&#13;
So even though I talked to him a lot about the environment, he also listened to others in the&#13;
institution about how they think the environment ought to be addressed and factored in the&#13;
economic development activities of the Bank, and then made his decisions in the balanced way&#13;
he always did.&#13;
&#13;
Q: What would be your opinion as to the criteria and attributes of a good World Bank president?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Well, a good World Bank president should not just be an environmentally&#13;
sensitive person. There are Bank activities that cut across a broad spectrum of issues: economic,&#13;
social, environmental and many others as well. In my view, a World Bank president should not&#13;
just be a banker. That seems like a good idea, but the World Bank is not a bank. And thatâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
probably part of the reason for some of the misunderstandings along the way of the mission.&#13;
People think it is the World Bank so it ought to work as a Bank. But itâ&#128;&#152;s not. It is a development&#13;
agency. Thatâ&#128;&#152;s how its shareholders meant it to be, whether for the reconstruction of Europe or&#13;
whether itâ&#128;&#152;s for the economic development of the countries out there. So I think some real&#13;
understanding of the development field would be very helpful for a World Bank president. They&#13;
tend to learn by doing and by being on the job. I remember with Jim Wolfensohn he took a major&#13;
trip, a long trip to Africa so that he could see for himself what really is happening out there. But I&#13;
think that itâ&#128;&#152;s important that presidents have some experience themselves, so that they can make&#13;
decisions based also on their knowledge and not just a matter of matching the advice that they&#13;
are getting to what they are seeing on their trips. And maybe in the future that could be a way of&#13;
thinking about it because for the time being it is a notion of a banker, and who knows, maybe&#13;
one day it will be a politician, and I donâ&#128;&#152;t think that would be helpful either.&#13;
&#13;
Q: OK. Since the GEF is administratively supported by the World Bank, and youâ&#128;&#152;ve already&#13;
talked about this, how has the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s organizational culture affected the workings of the GEF?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Well, there are really two ways to think about that. In terms of the implementation&#13;
aspects of the GEF, I think the Bank has done very well and has learned along the way just like&#13;
all of us. What the Bank has not done well relates to the whole discussion earlier on about the&#13;
environment. The same thing can be repeated again on the global environment, and this is not&#13;
just a judgment call on my part, this actually has been put in official papers of the Bank like the&#13;
paper on energy, â&#128;&#149;Fuel For Thought,â&#128;&#150; where they clearly said that global warming and climate&#13;
change are a global externality that the developing countries have nothing to do with. And yet&#13;
they are publishing all the other books and publications about how many lives and how much&#13;
productivity, in China and in Asia and other places, are being affected by air pollution. Now, air&#13;
pollution and the emissions that cause global warming come from the same source: burning&#13;
fossil fuels. So why would you make such a statement instead of trying to bring the countries on&#13;
board to understand that it is the burning of fossil fuels--coal, oil and so on--and the lack of&#13;
energy efficiency that contribute to both climate change and air pollution thatâ&#128;&#152;s hurting your&#13;
lives, your children, your vegetation and so on? And it is really that tunnel vision mentality that&#13;
causes the problems also in getting the countries to come on board with these issues of&#13;
environment, whether itâ&#128;&#152;s the local, national, or global environment. And thatâ&#128;&#152;s why the pressure&#13;
by NGOs and others, as I was talking about yesterday, is on the Bank in that the Bank not only&#13;
has clout, but has that valuable policy dialogue with client countries. If they would only raise the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Mohamed T. El-Ashry&#13;
                                 May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                36&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
environmental issues in these dialogues (which they donâ&#128;&#152;t) instead of having a separate mission&#13;
to talk about and address the environment, never really including it in the context of the broad&#13;
macroeconomic policies and subsidies and so on; itâ&#128;&#152;s in isolation.&#13;
&#13;
And then look at the CAS (Country Assistance Strategies). For a long time, even after the Bank&#13;
was talking about the environment, you could hardly find the environment in the Country&#13;
Assistance Strategies. Now, outside of one or two, you can hardly find the global environment in&#13;
the CAS, even though the Bank made the commitment to mainstreaming the global environment&#13;
in its actions. Thereâ&#128;&#152;s no mainstreaming there, as we saw in the case of climate change with&#13;
â&#128;&#149;Fuel For Thought.â&#128;&#150; So there is a disconnect between the good projects, where I truly give the&#13;
task managers a great deal of credit for being creative and for implementing in a great way the&#13;
projects of the GEF, going through the Bank with its broad attitude, broad position, and broad&#13;
policies on the global environment. So thatâ&#128;&#152;s one of the substantive issues.&#13;
&#13;
From that demonstrative issue there is still tremendous ignorance inside the Bank on how the&#13;
GEF really relates to the Bank. Some people still think that it is part of the Bank; some people&#13;
think that it is just another trust fund of the Bank and as a result why should we be different?&#13;
Why should we have any exceptions with regard to the human resources policy, for example, to&#13;
fit the business needs of the GEF? And even though we have been practicing some of these&#13;
exceptions over the last six or seven years, in comes a new person and immediately says, â&#128;&#149;Why&#13;
is that?â&#128;&#150; So he/she tries to remove all of these practices. So, of course, I end up going and&#13;
meeting with the Managing Director and with the Vice President of Human Resources and we&#13;
get a clear understanding, and this time I say, â&#128;&#149;I want this codified so that the next new person&#13;
that comes in can look at it and say, â&#128;&#151;Well, Iâ&#128;&#152;m not going to do that again.â&#128;&#152;â&#128;&#150; So there is a&#13;
tremendous amount of time and effort and attention at the high level to little things that should&#13;
have been taken care of at the lower level.&#13;
&#13;
The same thing with lawyers. Every time a young lawyer comes in--and of course lawyers are&#13;
trained to work word by word and by the book--he says, â&#128;&#149;I donâ&#128;&#152;t see why we have to do this with&#13;
the GEF. Why should the CEO sign that stuff?â&#128;&#150; So now we finally have an understanding again&#13;
to codify, and it is in the administrative manual that went in only a month ago, which should&#13;
have happened actually a long time before. So ultimately it works, like we said yesterday, and&#13;
thatâ&#128;&#152;s because you take it to a higher level, and of course higher levels understand. But the&#13;
amount of time and effort that goes into it is really tremendous.&#13;
&#13;
Q: OK. What is your assessment of the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s coordination efforts, and in what ways do they&#13;
benefit the GEF?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: The coordination effort was intended from day one to be able to bring the&#13;
different operational entities on board with whatâ&#128;&#152;s happening in the GEF, so that instead of the&#13;
small secretariat that we have here, there would be an internal coordination mechanism, go and&#13;
talk to every operational Vice Presidency: Asia, Africa, East, West, South whatever, and that has&#13;
actually worked very well. And again, we have to talk about individuals. Lars Vidaeus has been&#13;
the Executive Coordinator there. He is a terrific person who has a clear understanding of what&#13;
goes on and is able to work through the system in order to get the policies of the GEF&#13;
understood. And, you know, it has been evolving since there are changes all the time. So that is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Mohamed T. El-Ashry&#13;
                                May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     37&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
part of the work of the coordination unit which is to make sure that everybody is up to speed&#13;
with the new policies of the GEF. But, at the same time, they participate closely with the&#13;
secretariat in the formulation of some of these policies so it is not just a matter of being reactive&#13;
or just responding to what happens, they actually participate in the process itself. Ultimately, of&#13;
course, it is the Council that approves these policies, but the agencies, the coordination units in&#13;
the Bank, UNDP and UNEP all have a role to play in all of this, in being a partnership, after all.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Also in the context of country dialogue, do the coordination efforts of the Bank benefit the&#13;
GEF in some way, on the national, regional, and global levels?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Yeah, but the coordination units and regional coordinators do not participate in&#13;
the country dialogue. Itâ&#128;&#152;s the managers in the country departments that deal with the country&#13;
dialogue. And in fact, when I was in the Environment Department, one of the things I suggested,&#13;
and very few really took advantage of it, was, why donâ&#128;&#152;t you take along on a country dialogue&#13;
mission an environmental specialist? Then they can advise, and that would force the country&#13;
governments to bring an environmental person onto the scene, which would strengthen the role&#13;
of the environmental agency or ministry in the country itself, and strengthen development&#13;
through a dialogue on how the environment fits in the broad macroeconomic policies in the&#13;
country, including its broader economic development.&#13;
&#13;
Q: In your opinion, how should the Bank respond to its critics today in terms of its handling of&#13;
the environment?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Well, you have to understand how the situation on the environment in the Bank&#13;
today has gotten there. And I would just really give one example.&#13;
&#13;
In the farewell party when I left the Environment Department, one of the most senior people&#13;
said, â&#128;&#149;We want to thank Mohamed for taking us up that very steep learning curve on the&#13;
environment. I believe now we can plateau and take advantage of implementing all these things&#13;
rather than doing new things.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
And I chided him in responding by saying, â&#128;&#149;We have only scratched the surface. It may be a&#13;
steep curve, but we have just scratched the surface because there is a lot out there that needs to&#13;
be done.â&#128;&#150;&#13;
&#13;
I truly believe that thatâ&#128;&#152;s what happened, that beyond what was accomplished in that short period&#13;
of the three years, nothing more really happened. And not only that, but the water resources&#13;
policy that was done with my contribution in the Bank has been revised. The forest policy that&#13;
was done with my contribution early on has been revised. Thatâ&#128;&#152;s what the NGOs are&#13;
complaining about vehemently right now, particularly the forest policy. I mean, the Bank has&#13;
really no business to modify it so that it will be more acceptable to the loggers, to the people who&#13;
want to cut the forests. And thatâ&#128;&#152;s what gets people very upset and, from my perspective in the&#13;
GEF, I said to them, â&#128;&#149;It will be over my dead body that the GEF would finance a project that&#13;
involves any logging. You can change your policy, but thatâ&#128;&#152;s your policy. Thatâ&#128;&#152;s not going to be&#13;
the GEF policy.â&#128;&#150; So it is very clear at least to me, and I assume to those on the outside, to really&#13;
see what the Bank is doing right now and then look at what is going to happen.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Mohamed T. El-Ashry&#13;
                                 May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  38&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And that brings us back to the environmental assessment and to the resettlement issues. Now the&#13;
Bank all of a sudden has decided that it has had enough, or will do a little bit more, of the social&#13;
development activities and will go back heavily into infrastructure. It has even appointed a new&#13;
vice president for infrastructure and thereâ&#128;&#152;s going to be quite a bit of momentum going in that&#13;
direction. Now, infrastructure has the biggest environmental impact, and while the Bank is still&#13;
struggling with its implementation even 12 years after the assessment guidelines have been&#13;
adopted, it will be interesting to see whether there is going to be a stricter oversight on the&#13;
environmental assessment before not only the environment out there will get trashed as a result&#13;
of being ignored completely in the infrastructure development, but also the Bank itself. You&#13;
know, the Bank having gone up that steep slope can very well slide backwards because itâ&#128;&#152;s very&#13;
difficult really to see how the Bank learns from past experience, whether on environmental&#13;
assessment or on resettlement.&#13;
&#13;
On the resettlement, of course the biggest example was the Narmada Dam debacle where&#13;
eventually, as a result of tremendous outside pressure and after several years, the Bank decided&#13;
to withdraw from the project. Back then we conducted a review of the whole Bank resettlement&#13;
activities with Mike Cernea working under my supervision. It was one of the best reports that has&#13;
been done at the Bank on issues of that sort, and there was a follow up to it; there is no question&#13;
about it. There was immediate follow up to it, but I doubt very much that many of the people&#13;
working in the Bank who will be addressing infrastructure today know even of its existence. And&#13;
let me give just one example along that line.&#13;
&#13;
Now, before we do that, one of the major arguments of the Bank is that we have no control on&#13;
what the countries will do. If thatâ&#128;&#152;s the case, then why are you there? I mean, if you are a Bank&#13;
and just lending, fine, lend and go away. But thatâ&#128;&#152;s not the choice that you made. You decided&#13;
that you are going to be a development agency assisting countries in improving livelihoods&#13;
through economic development, socioeconomic development, whatever you want to call it. So&#13;
that puts a bigger responsibility now on you as an agency. So you have to ensure that the projects&#13;
are going to be sustainable, at least financially sustainable; they are successful as far as the&#13;
objectives are concerned. And that requires a number of actions in terms of implementing these&#13;
policies, these policies were put in place for a particular reason.&#13;
&#13;
Now we look at the example. And itâ&#128;&#152;s one of GEFâ&#128;&#152;s early projects in the pilot phase in Kenya&#13;
addressing the plight of one important species of monkeys in an area where the Masai live. It was&#13;
intended to be a very successful project when it was completed. Ten years later, nothing&#13;
happened. And finally last year it had to be cancelled. Because in the wisdom of the task&#13;
manager, it was decided that the best thing really to do is to take the people completely out of&#13;
that area, resettle them in another area, and pay them to resettle. And they wanted us in the GEF&#13;
to provide the money. We said, â&#128;&#149;The GEF does not pay for resettlement. The GEF pays for the&#13;
conservation effort that is there, there may be some administrative costs related to movement of&#13;
people but we are not going to pay to buy them houses.â&#128;&#150; And they put the whole onus on the&#13;
GEF and in canceling the project blamed the GEF for not going along. Thatâ&#128;&#152;s really beside the&#13;
point. The interesting thing is that when you look at the resettlement plan, itâ&#128;&#152;s exactly the same&#13;
old stuff thatâ&#128;&#152;s happened before whereby once the people knew that thereâ&#128;&#152;s going to be payment&#13;
their numbers have doubled. Anyone who did not live there started now to claim that they are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Mohamed T. El-Ashry&#13;
                                May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   39&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
living there so that they can get paid, so that they can get a better house in the new area. So what&#13;
have we learned really from the past? Had you repaid them and moved them, there would have&#13;
been complaints about how the government implemented the resettlement plan, just like what&#13;
happened in the Narmada and the people got kicked out without any compensation, and just like&#13;
what happened in many other projects. So itâ&#128;&#152;s very difficult sometimes really to see whether the&#13;
lessons are shared across the whole Bank. Iâ&#128;&#152;m not saying that there are no places in the Bank that&#13;
learn from their experiences, there are so many good things that happen in the Bank and so many&#13;
good people, but sometimes the institutional memory is not there, and one reason I truly believe&#13;
is, at least, part of the reason, is the insistence on moving staff every four years to another region&#13;
or another task.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Thereâ&#128;&#152;s no continuity?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Thereâ&#128;&#152;s no continuity; there is no institutional memory. And we find that&#13;
difficulty within the GEF in that we deal with new people and they have to be educated again.&#13;
Now, itâ&#128;&#152;s good to educate people but how are you going to get your business done when every&#13;
time you have to educate? I mean, why not place them with the person that was there for a year&#13;
or so and then have them take over? So all in all, whether itâ&#128;&#152;s really environmental assessment or&#13;
whether itâ&#128;&#152;s the social policy, itâ&#128;&#152;s going to be very interesting to see how these fare in the context&#13;
of the new focus on infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
Q: So would you say that, overall, there is a reinventing of the wheel across the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Only really in the context of when the Bank gets out of some aspects of the&#13;
business and then several years later comes back to it again. When that happens, the people who&#13;
worked there, some of them and sometimes many of them, leave the Bank. For example, in the&#13;
energy area, they decided weâ&#128;&#152;re not going to lend through energy because the private sector is&#13;
going to do all of that. So many of the good people who worked on energy at the Bank left, and,&#13;
in fact, this even affected our business on the climate change issue in the GEF. Now energy is&#13;
back, coming into vogue again, and theyâ&#128;&#152;re going to hire new people. There was an open-ended&#13;
ad in the Economist for energy specialists. So they are going to come from outside, brand new,&#13;
and they will start reinventing the wheel because no one has the time to sit and read everything&#13;
that has been done before. Everybody comes new and thinks, â&#128;&#149;I have now a mandate and a&#13;
charge to move forward.â&#128;&#150; And thatâ&#128;&#152;s not unique to the World Bank. Unfortunately, thatâ&#128;&#152;s the&#13;
mark of many of the big bureaucracies in the international system. Thatâ&#128;&#152;s what happens as you&#13;
go through changes and reorganizations and so on, so one cannot just blame the Bank for it. But&#13;
itâ&#128;&#152;s a matter of, if one is aware of these things, what can really be done in finding ways to&#13;
address them.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Moving on to GEFâ&#128;&#152;s oversight structure. Youâ&#128;&#152;ve already talked about this a little but Iâ&#128;&#152;d still&#13;
like to ask how has GEFâ&#128;&#152;s oversight structure, in terms of policy strategies and institutional&#13;
arrangements, impacted the effectiveness of its activities over the decades since it was&#13;
established in 1991? And, in your opinion, what might have been done differently, if anything?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Iâ&#128;&#152;ll start with the end. I donâ&#128;&#152;t really think anything could have been done&#13;
differently back then. That is not because Iâ&#128;&#152;m biased, since I was behind putting these things&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Mohamed T. El-Ashry&#13;
                                 May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   40&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
together, but itâ&#128;&#152;s because of the complex structure that we talked about yesterday. You had to&#13;
follow these steps, go with the step-wise approach and not immediately try to do everything in&#13;
the beginning, then learn by doing, and try to bring the countries themselves on board in&#13;
understanding really what the global environmental projects would look like and how does it fit&#13;
into their sustainable development efforts. I think when I look back myself at the first days in&#13;
1994 and the lack of trust that still existed following the negotiations on the restructuring of the&#13;
GEF and the 18 months that we took to put together the institutional structure and the policy&#13;
framework for the GEF, you could see the improvement over the 18 months.&#13;
&#13;
Initially, the meetings would go â&#128;&#151;til 2:00 and 3:00 in the morning because people just wanted to&#13;
debate for the sake of debating because the gap was still wide along the north-south axis.&#13;
Eventually, as they started dealing with the disbursement of funds, making decisions on money,&#13;
itâ&#128;&#152;s amazing how it orients the mind in a different way and you stop talking too much and you&#13;
start really dealing with the best and most efficient ways of making commitments on financial&#13;
resources. As a result, the Council now, for example, is really being touted by many people and&#13;
many observers, and many countries brought their senior people, the ministries of finance and so&#13;
on, to observe how the Council works. They may debate for a while, but ultimately a decision is&#13;
made very professionally during a two and a half-day meeting, meeting only twice a year on very&#13;
important policies and commitments of resources.&#13;
&#13;
I hope that this continues in a sense with the notion that this is really international cooperation.&#13;
This is not development assistance. And I think people learned along the way because some of&#13;
the representatives from the OECD countries come from development corporations, but they&#13;
learned along the way not to speak the language of development assistance. This is international&#13;
cooperation in support of the conventions, and there are two partners here: the developing; and&#13;
the developed countries. And the developing countries also learn that itâ&#128;&#152;s not a matter of saying,&#13;
â&#128;&#149;You know, I am entitled to this money.â&#128;&#150; Itâ&#128;&#152;s a matter of again sharing in the decisions that&#13;
affect them as well as ensure the integrity of the financial resources themselves so that there will&#13;
be more replenishments in the future. Everybody learned that lesson very quickly, in that you&#13;
have to really put safeguards in policies and on how the money is being spent so that we can&#13;
show to Parliaments and to Congress, if we are interested in getting more money in the future.&#13;
&#13;
Q: OK. In 1997 in the article, The GEF: A Self-Assessment, you refer to GEF as, â&#128;&#149;A pioneer&#13;
operating on one of the frontiers of sustainable development.â&#128;&#150; In your opinion, has the GEF&#13;
continued to be pioneering and innovative, and, more particularly, what role did you play in that?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Well, I really think so. In the sense that this is not just my view, I think the&#13;
Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development showed how the world in its entirety&#13;
feels about the GEF and how they look at the GEF as the hope in showing the way on different&#13;
approaches to doing business, not only in the context of projects on the ground, but in the context&#13;
of its governance, what I was just talking about on how developing and developed countries&#13;
work around the table of the Council itself. Thatâ&#128;&#152;s something that you donâ&#128;&#152;t really see in a great&#13;
way in other institutions, in other UN meetings, other UN conferences, itâ&#128;&#152;s pandemonium all the&#13;
time, even the Commission on Sustainable Development thatâ&#128;&#152;s supposed to follow up on Rio and&#13;
now to follow up on Johannesburg. Itâ&#128;&#152;s still the same old thing: two people talking over each&#13;
otherâ&#128;&#152;s heads. Each one is reading a statement, and no one is really listening to what the other is&#13;
&#13;

                                 May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    41&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
saying. They are concentrating on what they are going to say themselves in their statements and&#13;
correcting their statements till the last minute. So thatâ&#128;&#152;s why the GEF is truly a pioneer in how to&#13;
bring the UN and the Bretton Woods approaches, more importantly, to bring the environment&#13;
and the economic development and cooperation community together. And thatâ&#128;&#152;s a very&#13;
important thing and I think people are learning and they are trying to use the model in the&#13;
discussions, as I said yesterday, in the conventions, for example. Things have improved greatly&#13;
in terms of north-south discussions at the conventions, and itâ&#128;&#152;s mainly because itâ&#128;&#152;s the same&#13;
people who are also involved in the GEF.&#13;
&#13;
The same thing with addressing the global environment or the environment in the context of&#13;
development. By our insistence from the beginning, and because it was the right thing, as I felt&#13;
strongly that the developing countries would not accept making any commitment or doing&#13;
anything about the global environment unless they see the benefit to them in the context of&#13;
sustainable development. So we focused a good amount of the renewable energy on rural areas&#13;
where the poor people live. They donâ&#128;&#152;t have grid connections, and they probably will not have a&#13;
grid connection for many, many years to come. What we are showing is how you can at the same&#13;
time benefit the people as well as the environment.&#13;
&#13;
The same thing on the issue of biodiversity where it is not just a matter of conservation, but it is&#13;
also a matter of sustainable use of these resources. Protecting the watersheds so that the water&#13;
resources can benefit the people instead of disappearing immediately after all the trees have been&#13;
cut and carry all the silt with it downstream.&#13;
&#13;
So all in all, the GEF is on the cutting edge of demonstrating how to do things, and I think it will&#13;
continue to do that because if it doesnâ&#128;&#152;t I think it will lose the support that it now has. And thatâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
what we try to protect. If the GEF becomes perceived as another development assistance effort,&#13;
why do you have it in the first place? Why not just put the money in the Bank, UNDP, IFAD and&#13;
so on and not have a separate entity? So it has to be unique, and it has to be performing a unique&#13;
mission that others are not doing on their own but participate through this partnership, under that&#13;
umbrella, and actually contribute their experience and expertise for the sake of this bigger&#13;
agenda called the global environmental agenda.&#13;
&#13;
Q: In your opinion, how is the GEF perceived by the NGOs?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Very strongly. Very strongly because they see really in what we are doing, and&#13;
what I just described, the hope that they have themselves been advocating for some time and&#13;
thatâ&#128;&#152;s why they work very closely with us in a number of ways. They participate by being&#13;
observers in the policy deliberations themselves and they also participate as advisors to the&#13;
countries. A great number of the good projects are coming from countries where thereâ&#128;&#152;s good&#13;
involvement of NGOs. And third, as implementing organizations themselves, they implement a&#13;
number of the projects on the ground. The small grants program is completely directed towards&#13;
action by NGOs and community organizations on the ground. Then we developed a medium-&#13;
sized project approach for those who have the capacity and can implement bigger projects. Then&#13;
we created together, with the Bank, a separate partnership--the Critical Ecosystem Partnership&#13;
Fund, where the World Bank, the GEF, CI (Conservation International), the MacArthur&#13;
Foundation, and now the government of Japan, each has put $25 million into the fund for actions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                 May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  42&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
by NGOs in biodiversity hot spots. It operates in a very innovative way, handling proposals&#13;
electronically, for example, and getting small amounts of money disbursed quickly. This is just&#13;
one example of what you can do with partnerships. You know, many people talk about&#13;
partnerships but very few actually practice them.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Would you say that the NGOsâ&#128;&#152; association or partnership with the GEF has contributed to&#13;
the narrowing of the north-south gap?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Not necessarily, in the sense that the north-south gap on the NGO side still&#13;
remains wide because you have the advocacy NGOs in the north that are talking about big global&#13;
things while the NGOs in the south are at the country level, at the village level, and they are&#13;
interested really in seeing how poverty would be eradicated. They see the environment through&#13;
the lens of poverty rather than poverty through the lens of the environment. And that, even&#13;
though it has been reconciled among a few groups, does not really work yet the way it should in&#13;
terms of cooperation and partnerships on the larger scale that is needed. But Iâ&#128;&#152;m confident that&#13;
with the kind of people we have worked with this is constantly improving and will continue to&#13;
improve in the future.&#13;
&#13;
Q: What advice would you give your successor, Leonard Good? Notice we didnâ&#128;&#152;t ask, what are&#13;
the criteria and attributes of a good CEO and Chairman of the GEF, but you can certainly still&#13;
talk about it if you want to.&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: No, thatâ&#128;&#152;s OK. Leonard Good has the knowledge and experience to be able to&#13;
provide continued leadership for the GEF. Of course, his personality will dictate the ways in&#13;
which these things will happen. I think itâ&#128;&#152;s important to say that GEF right now is on a very solid&#13;
foundation, so youâ&#128;&#152;re not talking about an institutional structure that still needs to be developed&#13;
and all that. What is needed right now is fine-tuning based on past experience. And, as we talked&#13;
yesterday about the monitoring and evaluation becoming more important and more independent,&#13;
it needs to be able to provide the feedback loop to help design better projects. So my first advice&#13;
to him, which Iâ&#128;&#152;m going to tell him when we get together next week or the week after, is to&#13;
nurture the cooperative relationship that developed in the GEF--the G-77 and OECD countries.&#13;
That truly is key to the continued success of the GEF. If the GEF Council becomes another&#13;
debating society, itâ&#128;&#152;s going to lose the support that it now has and its uniqueness. I think this is&#13;
one of the best advice that I can give him. He will continue to have good task managers who will&#13;
do good projects, and, as I said, the policies are being fine-tuned. How to keep that complex&#13;
structure together? It is by getting his arms around it and making sure that it stays together and&#13;
not fall apart. And that requires a dedicated effort of consultations with GEFâ&#128;&#152;s multiple&#13;
stakeholders. I think that will be the single most important advice that Iâ&#128;&#152;ll be giving him.&#13;
&#13;
Q: What in your opinion are the lessons learned by the GEF experience related to global&#13;
environmental problems, and what future challenges lie ahead for the GEF?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Well, I think the biggest experience is that itâ&#128;&#152;s not easy to do these activities&#13;
where they are needed the most because there are still many people who donâ&#128;&#152;t really understand&#13;
how or why and because you donâ&#128;&#152;t really have the biggest partnership thatâ&#128;&#152;s needed, and thatâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
with the private sector--the private sector internationally as well as nationally in the countries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Mohamed T. El-Ashry&#13;
                                May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 43&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
themselves. So if thereâ&#128;&#152;s really one thing out of that experience that needs to happen in the short&#13;
run, it is to work a little harder on these partnerships, particularly on the private sector level.&#13;
&#13;
The second lesson really is that when the implementing agencies work together, the GEF and the&#13;
global environment benefit. When they compete with one another and fight with one another at&#13;
the country level, each wanting that one project, we all lose. We have past experience on that&#13;
front where for the same country we received two proposals that were exactly the same, one&#13;
from the Bank dealing with one ministry and one from UNDP dealing with another ministry. It&#13;
was a matter of who is going to beat the other to it. That was the example I used in one of my&#13;
annual meetings with the heads of the agencies. The CEO convenes the heads of the three&#13;
agencies once a year. As a result, there has been a tremendous effort of coordination at the&#13;
country level. But you still have the resident reps of the UNDP and you have the country&#13;
directors of the Bank, and it depends really on the chemistry and the cooperation between them.&#13;
So you really need a bigger commitment from the offices of the implementing agencies at the&#13;
country level. Those who have the commitment and understanding do much better than those&#13;
who donâ&#128;&#152;t. And thatâ&#128;&#152;s not just the Bank; thatâ&#128;&#152;s UNDP as well. UNEP does not, of course, have&#13;
country offices as such.&#13;
&#13;
Another lesson is when the mandates of the agencies and the activities of the GEF are clear,&#13;
things move quite well and efficiently. When they get fuzzed up, mainly because staff want them&#13;
to be fuzzy so that they can spend more than they are supposed to or do more than they are&#13;
capable of doing, you end up with problems--problems like going around and promising&#13;
countries projects that they cannot sell to the GEF in the first place. The example here is UNEP,&#13;
which is not an â&#128;&#149;operatingâ&#128;&#150; organization, yet itâ&#128;&#152;s called an implementing agency in the GEF&#13;
because you donâ&#128;&#152;t want to differentiate between them. It is not in their mandate to implement&#13;
projects on the ground. They can put together regional activities in cooperation with the other&#13;
agencies. We have been moving towards that, but still there is resentment. Does that make them&#13;
less than a full implementing agency having to work with UNDP, the Bank, or in partnership&#13;
with other organizations? But, again, you just keep hammering on it and insist on it and not be&#13;
swayed by the political pressure here and there, and it eventually gets done, and people&#13;
understand it.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Future challenges?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Future challenges? We talked yesterday about finance. I think thatâ&#128;&#152;s the biggest&#13;
challenge. We can have the largest replenishment ever like we did last August, but if the&#13;
countries, particularly the U.S., do not pay, then there is not enough money to get the job done.&#13;
And if that continues for a while then the GEF will lose its credibility. The support that is there&#13;
right now will erode, people will go to other places, will look for the small sources of money out&#13;
there that are now partnering with the GEF, and the whole effort gets fragmented. I really think&#13;
that is the biggest challenge.&#13;
&#13;
Another challenge is in the context of the ten implementing and executing agencies, whether that&#13;
model will actually continue to work the way it is set up right now or whether it will get upset&#13;
along the way either because of higher expectations on the part of the executing agencies or&#13;
because of strong lobbying by the implementing agencies to minimize their role. And as we were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Mohamed T. El-Ashry&#13;
                                May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    44&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
talking earlier about the competition between the three agencies, now you have to safeguard&#13;
against the ten agencies competing, and how do you manage all that with the small staff here in&#13;
the secretariat.&#13;
&#13;
Q: OK. Before concluding, is there anything you wish to talk about that we might have&#13;
overlooked during this interview?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Not in terms of topics. Again, itâ&#128;&#152;s the level of detail. Letâ&#128;&#152;s go back to&#13;
environmental assessment. There is a very good example that shows, similar to resettlement, that&#13;
unless you have the right agreement with the countries themselves you have no control&#13;
afterwards. The argument about, â&#128;&#149;We have no control over what the country is doing,â&#128;&#150; is right,&#13;
up to a point, in the sense that you did not get them to enter into a legal commitment to do these&#13;
things in the first place. Maybe they enter into a legal commitment when it comes to repaying the&#13;
loan but not on the environment.&#13;
&#13;
And the best example here that I was involved with was the Pak Mun Dam in Thailand which&#13;
was opposed by many NGOs, particularly the Thai NGOs. I was new in the Bank, and we were&#13;
to approve the environmental assessments. I was then approached on the subject by Gautum&#13;
Kaji, who was the country director at the time, so I said, â&#128;&#149;Well, let me look into it.â&#128;&#150; So I took all&#13;
of the environmental assessment reports that had been prepared, because that was one of the&#13;
sources of attack by the NGOs, and I read them all, and I realized that itâ&#128;&#152;s actually a very good&#13;
assessment. It does everything that an assessment ought to do. So my recommendation to him&#13;
was not to do another assessment, but there were some key issues that have been identified as&#13;
potential adverse impacts which was all an environmental assessment can do. A prediction, just&#13;
like the weather. It does not mean itâ&#128;&#152;s going to happen, but that it could, based on the technical&#13;
analysis. And the biggest potential impact was on fisheries, which ultimately affect the&#13;
livelihood of the people since it is a major source of their food in that region. So I came up with&#13;
an idea which is simply to put together as part of the agreement a scientific panel that would&#13;
monitor or examine the information, from monitoring the situation after the dam is built and the&#13;
gates are closed and seeing whether what is being predicted in the assessment will actually&#13;
happen, and then be prepared to take corrective actions. He accepted that, the country accepted&#13;
that, and it became part of the agreement on the project. We are talking now about 1992 or so--&#13;
actually, late 1991, early â&#128;&#152;92, because the Annual Meeting of the Bank in â&#128;&#151;91 was in Bangkok&#13;
and I met with the NGOs there and more or less got them to understand that this is really the&#13;
right approach.&#13;
&#13;
After that, the dam was built, no one really paid attention to it, and just late last year I read in a&#13;
newspaper about how the fisheries of that region behind the Pak Mun Dam have been practically&#13;
decimated. So it just shows you again that you canâ&#128;&#152;t just do that final evaluation report and walk&#13;
away. Now, too, you canâ&#128;&#152;t stay there all the time, but youâ&#128;&#152;ve got to make sure that the&#13;
agreements that have been done are being followed by the countries themselves, and there has to&#13;
be a way to deal with that as the Bank moves ahead with lending for infrastructure. Itâ&#128;&#152;s an issue&#13;
thatâ&#128;&#152;s not going to go away, whether itâ&#128;&#152;s on the environmental side or whether itâ&#128;&#152;s on the&#13;
resettlement and social development side.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                 May 29 and 30, 2003 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  45&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Q: OK, to conclude: What do you see as you major contribution to the environment in general,&#13;
and to the GEF in particular?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Oh, I will leave that to other people to judge. I really canâ&#128;&#152;t talk about that; that is&#13;
not me at all. I never talk about myself or what I have done. I leave that to other people. Iâ&#128;&#152;m only&#13;
proud to have been the head of the environment in the Bank for three years and to have&#13;
contributed to its activities at that time, and Iâ&#128;&#152;m extremely proud to have been given the&#13;
opportunity to lead this new organization called the GEF and bring it where it is right now.&#13;
&#13;
Q: At the same time, what have you learned from this experience?&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: I learned a great deal, which I intend now to reflect upon and share with others,&#13;
whether itâ&#128;&#152;s with graduate students, governments, or with the public at large. And itâ&#128;&#152;s all related&#13;
to many of the things we have talked about in this interview. How to ensure that the environment&#13;
is being addressed in the development process, and what are the political and economic forces&#13;
that influence all of that. And I want to use the experience from the operational side to show&#13;
through examples how issues of environment and sustainable development can be addressed&#13;
successfully.&#13;
&#13;
Q: We would like to thank you for an invaluable contribution to the Bankâ&#128;&#152;s Oral History&#13;
Program. It was a pleasure interviewing you.&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Well, I truly thank you for the opportunity. I never thought that this would happen&#13;
â&#128;&#151;til you sent me the email. So I truly thank you for the opportunity to express my views and be&#13;
able to speak about some of my experiences, all as a result of the good set of questions that you&#13;
put together.&#13;
&#13;
Q: Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
EL-ASHRY: Itâ&#128;&#152;s my pleasure. Thank you.&#13;
