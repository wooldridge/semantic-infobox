LEGAL REFORM PROJECT&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1           Fundamental change is well underway in Russia today. Since 1992, price and trade&#13;
liberalization, mass privatization. the development of a private financial sector has already led to the&#13;
emergence of new groups of entrepreneurs and new sources of wealth in the private sector. However,&#13;
economic reforms will not flourish and private investors and entrepreneurs will not prosper without a&#13;
legal system which can effectively protect private property, defend economic rights against infringement,&#13;
and establish a secu,e environment for investment and market relations. The extent of institutional change&#13;
in Russia today is not yet sufficient to ensure the continued efficient allocation of resources in the&#13;
emerging market economy. vWhich critically depends on the ability and willingness of market agents to&#13;
undertake independent economic activity.&#13;
1.2           Current legal protections available under the Russian legal system  are weak and&#13;
inadequate. This is, to a large extent, a legacy of the policies of the former socialist regime. For seventy&#13;
years the existence of property rights outside the state was barely recognized and independent economic&#13;
activity was discouraged. Executive bodies and other state organs frequently failed to implement laws&#13;
and almrost routinely issued legislative acts which contradicted laws. In addition, in the economic sphere,&#13;
the dispute resolution system was employed to carry out the central plan rather than to enforce property&#13;
rights, and the judicial system offered very few protections to citizens against administrative discretion&#13;
of executive agencies. Thus, in areas relating to private economic activity, the legislative framework has&#13;
had to be developed in great detail in order to overcome the inherent systemic prejudices against market&#13;
activities, the implication that certain activities were legally prohibited, and that citizens were to be left&#13;
open to administrative abuse. The means of securing legal protection and remedies for infringement of&#13;
economic rights, both in substantive and procedural terms, have in many instances proved to be barely&#13;
functional. What has emerged in Russia is an imperfect legal system that significantly impedes economic&#13;
transactions. Weak contract enforcement has resulted in the inclusion of risk premiums in the pricing&#13;
of goods and services. Business people feel that the laws are unreliable and contradictory. This&#13;
perception has contributed to fraud, sometimes on a massive scale, and corruption, the costs of which&#13;
are borne by the entire society. Last but not least, the inefficient judicial system fails to provide speedy&#13;
resolution of disputes and thus undermines the rule of law. This promotes the use of illegal channels to&#13;
protect property rights and to resolve competing claims.&#13;
1.3           The legal system comprises only one of many institutions which frame an economic&#13;
system, but it is arguably one of the most important. The legal system is the most formal of economic&#13;
and social constraints. Informal constraints on economic behavior are formed very much in relation to&#13;
the existing legal system. Moreover, institutional development is premised on a feedback effect: poor&#13;
institutions will lead to the emergence of organizations which are efficient at seeking rents, or creating&#13;
monopolies, which in turn will be interested in perpetuating the institutions which have favored them.&#13;
One of the key factors to a rapid and sustainable transition to the market lies in accelerating the process&#13;
of legal reform in Russia.&#13;
1.4           For the past five years the Russian legislature and Government have kept up an impressive&#13;
rate of legislative output which has begun to fill many of the initial gaps in the legislative framework&#13;
regulating the economy. However, even as the Goverrnment and the legislature work to fill these gaps&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                                    Technical Annex: Russia Legal Reform Project&#13;
by issuing new laws and regulations, the volume of economic and entrepreneurial activity has picked up&#13;
dramatically, and new problems are arising even as the new legal framework is being established. Just&#13;
as Soviet laws do not provide an adequate framework for market transactions, other legal&#13;
institutions-such as the judiciary, the legal profession, and information systems-are having difficulty&#13;
in responding to the new demands placed upon them. Given the explosive increase in the number of&#13;
economic transactions taking place in Russia today, key legal institutions are falling behind in their ability&#13;
to regulate the marketplace.  The result is eroding faith in the link between law and the effective&#13;
functioning of a market economy. Survey and focus group data point to the following:&#13;
*      Laws are not perceived to be the basis of economic relations;&#13;
a      People are overwhelmed by the volume and flow of new laws and regulations, and have&#13;
no way of accessing accurate information about the laws that govern business and&#13;
economic behavior;&#13;
*      People are not accustomed to seeking legal counsel, nor do they feel themselves qualified&#13;
to assess the quality of legal counsel they might get; and&#13;
*      Legal institutions ranging from judges, attorneys, and legal officials are held in low&#13;
esteem and are underutilized by the population-the result being that people often turn&#13;
to extra-judicial (and frequently illegal) means of resolving disputes.&#13;
The task of continuing to generate new legislation for a market economy still looms large. But the best&#13;
drafted laws, if people perceive the laws to be not implemented or enforced, cannot lead to a properly&#13;
functioning market economy. A program  for legal reform in a transition economy such as Russia,&#13;
therefore, must aiso be equally focused on the effort to build institutions which restore, or develop, the&#13;
readiness of people to abide by and uphold the law.&#13;
1.5           A  program  supporting legal reform  in the transition to a market economy has&#13;
pzeliminarily been identified by the Government as including, among others, continuing tofill the gaps&#13;
in the legislative framework, including at the regional level; ensuring public access to transparently and&#13;
systematically organized authoritative laws and regulations; improving the education of lawvers and&#13;
awareness of the public about and other members of the legal profession; and beginning to reform the&#13;
judicia,y. Each one of :hese tasks is a long-term effort involving considerable resources. However, these&#13;
tasks cannot easily be delinked from one another. One cannot begin to encourage the public to turn to&#13;
law on resolving economic disputes if the courts are not adequately staffed to handle cases efficiently.&#13;
Nor can the country cap.ure the full value of well-drafted laws if the laws are not readily accessible to&#13;
the public for them to begin abiding by them. Finally, seeking legal counsel will be a frustrating exercise&#13;
for people who finr' hat law school graduates have had little expertise in law touching upon economic&#13;
transactions and training ili-suited to the practice of law.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Il. INSTITULIONAL SETTING&#13;
2.1            The central objective of legal reform for the economic transition is to create a framework&#13;
of laws and legal institutions that support and regulate the range of economic activities which make up&#13;
a market. The discrete tasks associated with legal reform in the transition as discussed below range from&#13;
the creation of a legislative base, increasing the availability of information about and understanding of&#13;
the law, the strengthening of the judiciary, and the growth and development of the legal profession. The&#13;
establishment of a legal framework for a market in a transition country like Russia, however, cannot&#13;
succeed if it cannot simultaneously begin to legitimize a larger, more authoritative role for law in the&#13;
governance of society. Legal reform for the economic transition in a country like Russia is integrally&#13;
linked to the legitimation of law as an organizing principle in society, rather than as an instrument of&#13;
political power. This in turn cannot be accomplished by fiat-rather, law must be shown and proven to&#13;
be of value in organizing economic and social transactions and in protecting individual citizens and&#13;
entrepreneurs against the misuse of administrative discretion of the agencies of executive power. Under&#13;
these circumstances, the passage of new laws appropriate for the market which are not effectively&#13;
promulgated, implemented, or enforced is not enough. Nor will improvements in the implementation and&#13;
enforcement of laws which are still oriented to a planned economy be sufficient. On the contrary, either&#13;
approach can prove to be harmful to the credibility of law, and ultimately to the sustainability of legal&#13;
reform in a transition economy.&#13;
2.2           In the years since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Russian legislature and&#13;
Government have succeeded in filling many of the initial gaps in the systemic legislative framework by&#13;
passage of numerous laws, decrees and regulations affecting market activity. There remains, however,&#13;
the far greater problem of basic institutional development in the legal sphere. Both Governmnent officials&#13;
and outside observers have concluded that the sustainability of legal reform for the transition depends&#13;
criticall, upon the creation and development of key legal institutions. These tasks include, among others,&#13;
strengthening of the law making process (the process by which the country drafts, considers and adopts&#13;
its laws and regulations at federal and regional levels and coordinates these efforts); improvement of legal&#13;
information systems (which make systematically and transparently organized laws and regulations widely&#13;
accessible to government at all levels, to legislators, judges, the legal profession and the public);&#13;
developing legal education and training (to produce competent lawyers, judges and other legal officials&#13;
required to defend and enforce the rights of market agents and to educate the public about its newly&#13;
established economic rights); and reforming the judiciary (the best laws, if inappropriately or inadequately&#13;
enforced, can neither defend the private sector against encroachments by the state, nor against the&#13;
exercise of monopoly power in the marketplace); and establishing expeditious and efficient alternative&#13;
dispute settlement mechanisms which complements the official adjudication of disputes.&#13;
2.3            Institutions are almost never built completely anew. Successful legal reform in Russia&#13;
will depend on the extent to which new institutions can incorporate, if not co-opt, elements of actors&#13;
functioning within existing institutions. In developing a legal framework for a market economy, the&#13;
Russian authorities have had to work with existing legal traditions and institutional structures which are,&#13;
at best, marginally suited to supporting market activities. In the legislative area, for example, although&#13;
in many cases systemic overhauling of the existing codes of law would be simpler, such instances have&#13;
so far been limited to the adoption of the Constitution, and the first two parts of the Civil Code.&#13;
Working in the context of existing traditions and institutional structures, moreover, has tended to preserve&#13;
the power of organizations and interest groups which have a vested interest in preserving existing&#13;
institutions. While in many cases there is potential for adapting existing codes and statutes to the&#13;
demands of the market, some institutional processes have to be fundamentally changed to facilitate this&#13;
incremental process of legal reform. These institutional distortions, in fact, have until recently prevented&#13;
reform efforts from being focused and coordinated among the various government agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

2.4           Recently, cor:enisus on the importance of legal reform has emerged within Russian&#13;
agencies under the guidance of the GGPU, which in 1994, 1995 and the beginning of 1996 has taken&#13;
a number of steps to .,oordinate legal reform efforts across all branches of government and to attempt to&#13;
address comprehensively the problems in the legal system outlined above. This approach has been&#13;
broadly enldorsed by other branches of the government, and 1995 saw considerable progress in&#13;
cooperative efforts aWross government units to identify a legal reform program. The Government's&#13;
program, as outlined in recent presidential decrees, has reinforced support for various aspects of the legal&#13;
and judicial reforms ana has created various law reform commissions, containing representatives of key&#13;
branches and units of governimeint to prepare and implement legal reform proposals.&#13;
2.5           Most recently, an All-Russian Congress on Legal Reform was held in Moscow in March&#13;
1996. In his address to the Congress, President Yeltsin declared that the primary objective of legal&#13;
reform is to demon,trate the vital necessity of law for economic and social development. He sketched&#13;
four principal directions for further reform efforts:&#13;
0      Development of the legislative base is understood to include not only the adoption of&#13;
such key missing elements of the legislative base as the third (final) part of the Civil&#13;
Code, Code of Civil Procedure and Code of Criminal Procedure, as well as legislation&#13;
affirming guarantees of hiuman rights and freedoms. It also comprises the following&#13;
goals: (a) eliminating internal contradictions in laws regulating various spheres of&#13;
activity; (b) creating a mechanism of control over executive rule-making; and (c) setting&#13;
down in law a mechanism of implementation of powers vested in the subjects of the&#13;
Federation.&#13;
i     Judicial reform will be focused first and foremost on changes in the fiscal framework to&#13;
guarantee judicial independence. Government officials at the Congress indicated that they&#13;
envisage the creation in the near future of an independent Judicial Department that would&#13;
take over the functions of financing and overseeing the courts of general jurisdiction from&#13;
the Ministry of Justice. Changes in court administration and case management and better&#13;
enforcement of court decisions are also anticipated.&#13;
e      Delineating the role of executive organs and clarifying the scope of their authority has&#13;
also been included as a key issue in legal reform and will be tackled through legislation&#13;
on the role and function of executive power. These laws are expected, among other&#13;
things, to focus on the problems of federal-regional relations, especially the procedures&#13;
of taking decisions in areas of joint jurisdiction.&#13;
*      Efforts to improve public awareness about legal issues are intended to include&#13;
development of legal information and professional legal education systems, introduction&#13;
of teaching of fundamentals of law in all high schools, and increased support for legal&#13;
scholarship.&#13;
In spite of the high level of political consensus indicated by this program, the institutions involved in legal&#13;
reform display varying degrees of commitment to leading reform in each of the areas named above. This&#13;
recognition has guided project design in each of the four areas identified in this project, as below:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Section I1. Institutioral Setting                                                              5&#13;
2.6           Legal drafting. In the last two and a half years, since the adoption of the December 1993&#13;
Constitution, the number of laws passed by the Parliament has grown exponentially. Notwithstanding the&#13;
breakneck pace of legislative activity, the task of creating a legal framework for the market is far from&#13;
complete.  Obsolete laws and legal and regulatory gaps and overlaps abound in areas of crucial&#13;
importance for effective functioning of a market, including real property law, taxation, and bankruptcy.&#13;
Moreover, the need to keep pace with the rate of both the macroeconomic and structural changes taking&#13;
place in the Russian economy today has led to the passage of imperfect laws, such that many laws which&#13;
have already been adopted are often not consistent with each other and even within themselves and need&#13;
to be modified or amended. Both the task of completing the legal basis for transition to a market, and&#13;
of beginning the internal harmonization and codification of the accumulating large mass of new legislation&#13;
must be continued to preserve and develop the role of legal institutions in regulating the market.&#13;
2.7           International technical assistance in this context cannot, of course, substitute for a policy&#13;
commitment to pass the laws necessary to support the continued development of a market economy in&#13;
Russia. It cannot serve as a direct substitute for improved coordination within the government. Nor can&#13;
it significantly reduce the amount of work associated in the drafting of a particular piece of legislation.&#13;
It can, however, inform the process of legal drafting in Russia with comparative experience, with&#13;
knowledge of models of how particular laws or combination of laws can be implemented and enforced&#13;
in practice.  At the same time, any technical assistance in this area must be provided within an&#13;
institutional framework which does not exacerbate the task of internal coordination-full government&#13;
ownersltip of the mechanisms by which this technical assistance is received and allocated among&#13;
government entit'es involved in the legal drafting process will be critical.   A final issue in the&#13;
institutional setting for legal drafting in Russia concerns the federal nature of the polity. Federalism in&#13;
Russia is as yet very new, with subjects of the Federation only now beginning to adopt their own laws.&#13;
Giv -n the certralized nature of policy making in the pre-reform period, regional authorities have had no&#13;
meaningful experience in legislative drafting. As yet, the legislative basis for jurisdictional separation is&#13;
incomplete. Pr"blems of conflict of jurisdiction are only beginning to emerge, but have the potential to&#13;
become far Iniore widespread and mechanisms on how to resolve these are insufficient.  In this&#13;
institutional conte.;t, Bank intervention will be directed to three areas: providing comparative advice in&#13;
the legal drafting process (building in particular on the experience of bilateral donors in financing such&#13;
assistance); carrying out studies which could provide the basis for institutional changes which can improve&#13;
the process of coordinating legal drafting; and training regional authorities in legislative drafting and&#13;
providing technical drafting assistance to regional authorities on a pilot basis.&#13;
.8           Lepaf information. Creation of effective and widely accessible legal information systems&#13;
is to a large extent comp!2mentary to the task of creating a modern legislative base. In Soviet times, laws&#13;
adopted by the Supreme So- iet were few, couched in general terms, useless in real life-and easy to find.&#13;
On the othler hand, the rules and regulations of executive agencies which in reality governed the conduct&#13;
of economic and political affairs were largely concealed from public view. In the context of a planned&#13;
economy the snciety was not required to be familiar with law and was in fact discouraged from it. By&#13;
contrast, market-based economies rely on publicly accessible, transparently and systematically organized&#13;
legal information f-or the effective implementation of law. The volume of laws and regulations in a&#13;
market economy is exp';nentially higher, and systemic functioning relies far more heavily on voluntary&#13;
compliance with the law than on direct enforcement.  Laws are useless unless they are applied by&#13;
economic actors tc further their interests. In this context the role of systems designed to inform the&#13;
public abou, law plays a radically different role in a market than in a planned economy. A market&#13;
economy. which i, the final analysis cannot be dissociated from a law-based state, cannot exist without&#13;
an effective system of lugal .nformation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6                                                   Technical Annex: Russia Legal Reform Project&#13;
2.9            Such a system  does not yet exist in Russia, but efforts aimed at its creation are&#13;
intensifying. Several federal agencies are directly involved in the development of databases and electronic&#13;
distribution systems for legal information. The most important among these are databases maintained by&#13;
the MOJ, GGPU, and the High Arbitrazh Court. The MOJ Scientific Center for Legal Information&#13;
(NCPI) is meant to service the needs of the system of the MOJ and its regional centers (in each of the&#13;
89 subjects of the RF) and the courts of general jurisdiction, while a more limited electronic version is&#13;
available for the public on commercial terms. The GGPU has contributed to the STC "Systema" database&#13;
which is designed to be both an authoritative standard as well as a source for updated pieces of federal&#13;
legislation both for government entities and the public. Although a high level working group, Federal&#13;
Commission for Legal Informatization, has been established by a presidential decree to develop a&#13;
framework and design for effective dissemination of legal information, the level of consensus and&#13;
coordination it can generate remiains to be seen. In addition, a number of private sector providers of legal&#13;
information operate in Russia. Among these are companies such as Konsultant and Garant that are&#13;
becoming an important source of timely information (although not always accurate), mostly for&#13;
commercial users. However, no clear policy has yet emerged on the appropriate relationship between&#13;
the public and private sectors. In this context, the project seeks not to build a comprehensive legal&#13;
information system, but to define the appropriate role for public sector investment in this area, the&#13;
feasibility of such a system and its relationship to a number of agencies and ministries involved in this&#13;
area, and the way in which such a system might appropriately interact with emerging private-sector&#13;
providers of legal information.&#13;
2.10          Over the last several years, the Russian Parliament and executive agencies have issued&#13;
a massive amount of legislative enactments. Currently, there does not exist any systematized way of&#13;
organizing legislation. Enactments are published in daily newspapers and, with a significant time lag and&#13;
in insufficient quantities, in official gazettes. These publications are only chronological. Therefore, in&#13;
researching a legal issue at any given time, one must look through years of chronologically published&#13;
official gazettes (if available). This situation forces most official bodies, courts, and private practitioners&#13;
to create their own classification systems of legislation-systems that allow them to readily access the&#13;
enactments they need. Such a system in which each agency has to create its own organization for&#13;
legislation is very inefficient.  The project will provide technical assistance to assess the current&#13;
classification systems existing in Russia and recommend the design of a classification system that can be&#13;
introduced nation-wide, in both written and electronic form. Another endemic problem in Russian&#13;
legislation over the last several years has been frequent contradictions and overlap among different pieces&#13;
of legislation. The project will provide technical assistance to develop methodology on how to "codify"&#13;
Russian legislation, once the classification system is developed, i.e., summarize and index all pieces of&#13;
legislation on any given topic and then, through legislative action eliminate overlapping pieces of&#13;
legislation ("svod zakonov"). International technical assistance in this area can be particularly useful due&#13;
to successful recent experience with codification in countries such as The Netherlands.&#13;
2.11          Legal education. Radical changes in the substance and scope of law and changes in the&#13;
demand for professional legal services have in many ways overwhelmed the system of professional legal&#13;
education. There are not nearly enough legal educational institutions available to provide training to a&#13;
sufficient number of lawyers to satisfy both private and public sector demands. Some 60 schools are&#13;
accredited to provide legal education, but they are hampered by the inability to provide legal education&#13;
appropriate for the practice of law in a market economy. Curricula are outdated, with little coverage of&#13;
legal issues related to the needs of a market economy. Professors who are able to teach economic law&#13;
courses are in extremely short supply. Many law schools are not familiar with teaching materials or&#13;
methods geared towards the development of skills to practice, rather than to study, law. The increased&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Section Il. Institutionul Setting                                                                  7&#13;
demand for !egal education has also led to the emergence of both private and quasi-private (associated&#13;
with public institutions, but juridically separate) teaching institutions. While most of these institutions&#13;
have not been acccedited by the State Committee for Higher Education (SCHE), demand for legal&#13;
education is such that attendance even at non-accredited institutions is significant'. Structural weaknesses&#13;
in the institutions -uiding legal education, including the SCHE and the Ministry of Justice, have so far&#13;
prevented top-down reforms of curricula, teaching materials, and methods. In addition, even if new&#13;
accreditation standards were to be adopted, it is not clear whether any law schools would be in a position&#13;
to meet them. In this context, Bank intervention is designed to work with a number of the stronger law&#13;
schools to develop law schoc; capacity in selected areas. This will be accomplished through the financing&#13;
of grants in areas such as the development of new courses, innovative teaching materials, new teaching&#13;
mt:lhodologies, teacher retraining, and clinical training.&#13;
2.12           Pullic education campaignts. Currently, there are wide gaps in the Russian population's&#13;
knowledge of the concept of rule of law, as well as in efforts to educate the public about such principles.&#13;
Baseline research (a summarv of which is in Appendix H) indicates that the Russian public does not yet&#13;
see the law as the primary framework for economic and business relationships. The vast majority of&#13;
people fundamentally distrusts all law enforcement agencies, including the courts. Media content analysis&#13;
indicates that media coverage of legal topics does little to address this problem, pointing to the fact that&#13;
most Russian journalists lack the basic knowledge, understanding, and research skills required to analyze&#13;
and write about law as its functions in a market-based economy. Nor are legal texts, commentaries or&#13;
basic texts readily available for the general public. At the same time, studies show that the Russian&#13;
public is aware of the unsatisfactory condition of the legal system and would like to make better use of&#13;
existing legal mechanisms to meet its business and other needs. This points to the conclusion that broad-&#13;
based efforts to increase public understanding and use of law as the basis for economic and business&#13;
activity could bring highly favorable results. Baseline research also indicates that a public information&#13;
campaign tightly focused on the role of law in regulating and organizing market transactions would be&#13;
accepted by a large majority of the public groups encompassing a wide range of political and social&#13;
opinions. The project will focus its technical assistance on mass media education, public education about&#13;
law in secondary schools, and on public information campaigns about alternative dispute resolution.&#13;
2.13           Judicial reform. The Russian judicial system faces two challenging tasks. First, the&#13;
economic reforms accompanying the transition to a market-based economy have resulted in a manifold&#13;
increase in market participants and transactions. This has placed new burdens on the formal adjudicating&#13;
system, especially in view of the increasing reliance of the business community and individuals on newly&#13;
sanctioned property and contractual rights which require enforcement by an effectively run and fair&#13;
judicial system. Second, the 1993 Constitution of the RF formally established the judiciary as an&#13;
independent branch of government. Russian judges, who in the past merely fulfilled the role of civil&#13;
servants, are now faced with the difficult task of building up their independence in adjudicating disputes,&#13;
adjusting to their new role as neutral arbiters in civil matters, and assuming the role of protecting the&#13;
legal rights of citizens vis-a-vis state agencies in a variety of criminal and administrative matters. Partly&#13;
in response to the challenges posed by the above and partly because of the legacy of Soviet institutions,&#13;
a complex and convoluted structure of judicial institutions has emerged in Russia today. It includes the&#13;
Constitutional Court, three instances of courts of general jurisdiction, and three instances of arbitrazh&#13;
(commercial) courts. There is no unified or even similar structure for administering and financing the&#13;
various courts. The Constitutional Court is directly funded from the federal budget and administered&#13;
I/ In 1995 state institutions admitted 33,000 students and private institutions 25,000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8                                                      Technical Annex. Russia Legal Reform Project&#13;
independently from the other courts. The first two instances of courts of general jurisdiction are&#13;
administratively and financially subordinate to the MOJ; their budget is channelled through the MOJ.&#13;
Their third instance, the Supreme Court of the RF, is funded directly from the federal budget and&#13;
administered independently.  This makes the courts of general jurisdiction suffer from  a lack of&#13;
institutional leadership. Also importantly, it makes the first two instances of the judiciary beholden to&#13;
the MOJ, an executive agency which has a vested interest in maintaining the status quo and little incentive&#13;
to champion the cause of judicial reform which would eventually lead to pressures to institutionalize the&#13;
independence of the judiciary by severing or limiting MOJ's links with the courts. The arbitrazh courts&#13;
(which are transformed from the former 'state arbitrazh'-a quasi-judicial executive agency vested with&#13;
resolving disputed among state-owned enterprises) are fiscally and institutionally better off than the courts&#13;
of general jurisdiction and frequently are better staffed. There is a substantial jurisdictional overlap&#13;
between the two court systems in economic disputes. The arbitrazlh courts resolve economic disputes only&#13;
among judicial entities and among registered individual entrepreneurs. If one of the parties is a physical&#13;
person, the same dispute falls under the jurisdiction of general courts. The High Arbitrazh Court which&#13;
administers all three instances of arbitrazh courts and receives a direct federal budgetary allocation is not&#13;
particularly open to the idea of merging this dual-track system.&#13;
2.14           Judicial reform, including the introduction of structural changes, remains high on the&#13;
reform policy agenda. In the March 1996 Congress on Legal Reform, President Yeltsin underscored the&#13;
need to address judicial reform including the creation of a judicial department for the courts of general&#13;
jurisdiction, this would integrate the three instance system and limit the role of the MOJ vis-a-vis the&#13;
courts. In the current legislative and institutional context of the judiciary, external assistance can be&#13;
effective only in a limited number of areas. Therefore, the project seeks to address several discrete areas&#13;
of judicial reform. It will finance technical assistance to fill some of the gaps in the rules of procedure;&#13;
to train judges of general jurisdiction and arbitrazh courts; a study of the courts of general jurisdiction&#13;
to analyze ways in which to improve court administration and case management; and judicial workshops&#13;
which could lead to the development of professional and institutional consensus for judicial reform among&#13;
the judiciary.&#13;
2.15           Alterative dispute resolution. Private sector participants in both developed and developing&#13;
countries often seek alternatives to having their disputes adjudicated through official judicial bodies.&#13;
Alternative forms of dispute resolution (ADR), are receiving increased recognition world-wide as an&#13;
integral compoaent of law-based societies. For example, even in extremely litigious societies, such as&#13;
the United States. relatively few contract violations are resolved in formal courts of law. Mediation,&#13;
arbitration, conciliation, informal negotiations, and mini-trials complement the official adjudicating bodies&#13;
and often pro-ide quicker and less expensive solutions to a range of legal problems. As a complement&#13;
to reforming the state-run judicial system and strengthening its institutional capacity, the GOR is&#13;
interested in the development of quasi-judicial, alternative forms of dispute resolution. ADR is perhaps&#13;
even more important in countries with poorly developed legal institutions, like Russia or other countries&#13;
in transition. For example, shortcomings in the Chinese legal system have made the Chinese international&#13;
arbitration agency tne most active in the world in 1995.  Similarly, where formal Russian legal&#13;
institutions are often seen as rigid and difficult to use, skilled mediators or arbiters can often reach&#13;
innovative solitions. A wcll-functioning ADR system can also exert competitive pressure on the formal&#13;
courts of lawv. especially in commercial disputes. Given the poorI state of the formal judicial institutions&#13;
in Russia and the resulting distrust of the citizenry in these institutions, ADR can be a welcome&#13;
alternative with a potential to make an important contribution to strengthening the rule of law in Russia.&#13;
Over the last several years, ADR has progressed in several sectors in Russia, including commercial&#13;
arbitration among entrepreneurs, banks, insurance companies, and securities markets participants; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Section II. Institutional Setting                                                            9&#13;
mediation of consumer and labor disputes. Currently, there are more than 300 private arbitration panels&#13;
registered in Russia. Yet, ADR in Russia suffers from a variety of problems that can be addressed&#13;
through technical assistance. Ignorance of the availability and advantages of ADR is widespread among&#13;
the population and in many sectors of the economy. The legislative basis for ADR is not adequate;&#13;
private arbitration functions on the basis of a 1992 provisional regulation. The limited number of&#13;
specialists versed in ADR methodology impedes further growth of the sector. (For example, the Service&#13;
for the Resolution of Labor Disputes of the Ministry of Labor routinely turns away requests for assistance&#13;
due to the lack of qualified specialists.) Due to the relative novelty of the sector in Russia, ADR experts&#13;
work in isolation and lack the basic means and infrastructure to exchange and disseminate views and&#13;
information about their practice. The project will start addressing some of these shortcomings through&#13;
financing: technical assistance in the preparation of a legislation covering ADR; training seminars for&#13;
trainers in arbitration and mediation; public information campaigns on ADR; and support for annual&#13;
meetings of specialists involved in ADR.&#13;
2.16          Project Implementation Agency. To carry out the proposed project, which cuts across&#13;
so many institutions and areas, the Government has established the Russian FoundationforLegal Reform&#13;
(RFLR). It will be responsible for implementing all components of the project. The founders of the&#13;
RFLR are the Presidential Administration, the MOJ, the MOF, the Securities and Exchange Commission,&#13;
and the Academy of Sciences of the Russian Federation. It is envisioned that the RFLR will continue&#13;
to be active after project completion in the area of legal reform, receiving funds from budgetary sources,&#13;
own legal expertise, and grants from other public or private donors. A detailed description of its&#13;
structure and functions is contained in Part V of this report, as well as in Appendix M.&#13;
2.17          Other donor assistance for legal reform. In addition to Bank's assistance to Russia since&#13;
1991 in areas like banking, privatization, and natural resources law and regulations, Russia has received&#13;
assistance from a number of countries and organizations. These are described in Appendix B and include&#13;
support for specific pieces of legislation, training of officials and judges and programs to improve&#13;
legislation. Russia has also received assistance in non-economic areas of legal reform, including criminal&#13;
law improvements, jury trials, police training, electoral law assistance, and constitutional reforms.&#13;
Private agencies and non-government organizations have supported individual aspects of law reform.&#13;
Private agencies and non-government organizations have supported individual law school exchange&#13;
programs and training of lawyers and bar associations. While support for criminal law reform and law&#13;
enforcement is increasing among official agencies, direct assistance for economic law reform is decreasing&#13;
rapidly due primarily to bilateral aid cutbacks set for 1996 and 1997.&#13;
2.18          The lessons which have been learned from other assistance provided in Russia for legal&#13;
reform, including by the Bank, are several. First, government commitment is essential in order to effect&#13;
change in the legal frarnework. Reform must therefore be owned by the government and not imposed&#13;
from the outside. Second, since legal reform crosses governmental structures and branches, an overall&#13;
reform program is needed as well as an institutional capacity to carry out such a program. Otherwise&#13;
assistance will tend to be piecemeal and of limited impact. Third, there is both substantial lack of&#13;
knowledge and skepticism in Russian society about the proper role of the legal system. Changes in the&#13;
structures and institutions must be accompanied by changes in attitudes among the public and a&#13;
willingness to use the legal system to defend individual economic rights. Last, legal reform in Russia&#13;
will be a long-term process.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
111. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.1           The overall objective of the project is to improve the performance of the Russian legal&#13;
system in areas key to the effective functioning of market institutions. Specific project objectives are:&#13;
a) To improve the quality of drafting of economic laws, decrees and regulations. To the&#13;
extent possible, this effort will complement the structural reform objectives of other Bank&#13;
projects which involve policy and legislative reforms. To assist the GOR in analyzing&#13;
federal/regional and federal interagency coordination in drafting laws and regulations.&#13;
On a pilot basis, to improve legislative drafting at the regional level.&#13;
b) To assist the GOR in designing the appropriate classification of legislation (including&#13;
in electronic format) and in identifying the appropriate method of codifying Russian&#13;
legislation. To assist the GOR in determining the appropriate scope and framework, as&#13;
well as levels of public investment, in both the electronic and non-electronic systems for&#13;
collection, organization and dissemination of legal information.&#13;
c) To begin to introduce innovative teaching methods and materials in the legal education&#13;
system, with particular emphasis on increased exchange between legal academia and&#13;
practice and to improve teacher training. To begin to improve public awareness and&#13;
understanding of the role of law in a market economy.&#13;
d) To improve the quality of judicial training for courts of general jurisdiction and&#13;
arbitrazh courts.  To assist the GOR in analyzing impediments to effective court&#13;
administration and case management in courts of general jurisdiction. To assist the&#13;
Russian judiciary in reaching broad-based consensus for necessary structural reform of&#13;
the sector. To promote the development of ADR in Russia.&#13;
3.2           These objectives are designed to complement and reinforce one another and as a result,&#13;
promote a program of compcehensive legal reform in Russia. For example, legislative changes needed&#13;
for judicial reform will be included in the drafting component. New legislation enacted following the&#13;
provision of tcchnical assistance in legislative drafting will be disseminated to federal and regional&#13;
authorities via a dissemination system, a feasibility study for which is funded out of the legal information&#13;
system. Also, one of the focusses of public education campaigns about the role of law in a market&#13;
economy will be campaigns on the utility of alternative methods of dispute resolution which will reinforce&#13;
the ADR development subcomponent of the judicial reform component.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
IV. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
4.1           'lhere are four inter-related project components, consisting of technical assistance to&#13;
sLipport: (a) legal drafting; (b) collection and dissemination of legal information; (c) legal education,&#13;
including public education campaigns; and (d) judicial reform, including support for alternative dispute&#13;
resolution. In addition, other high priority activities, agreed upon between the Government and the Bank,&#13;
may be eligible for financing under the project. Costs noted below exclude taxes and duties and&#13;
contingencies.&#13;
Legal Drafting&#13;
4.2           To assist in the drafting of economic laws, decrees and regulations at the federal level,&#13;
technical assistance will be p, u vided to various executive agencies and institutes involved in the legislative&#13;
drafting process for key legal acts over the life of the project. A list of laws, decrees, and regulations&#13;
eligible for teclii;icai _ssistance will be submitted and agreed upon between the GOR and the Bank on an&#13;
annual basis. The RFLR in its capacity as the implementing agency for the project will generate a draft&#13;
list of legal acts ba;ed on the overlap of the Government's annual legislative agenda and project&#13;
objectives, to be submitted to the Government. The list would focus on high priority enactments which&#13;
are consistent with the GOR's economic reform program. The Government will in turn convey this list&#13;
to the Bank. For cach piece of legislation the Government will at the same time inform the RFLR and&#13;
the Bank which federal agen.:les and/or institutes are included in a working group set up for each piece&#13;
of legislation which will be the beneficiary of this technical assistance, as well as which agency is&#13;
designated to be the lead agency in drafting this legislation. The RFLR will then consult with the&#13;
working group as to t'ie type, trl. scope, and duration of technical assistance needed for a particular piece&#13;
of legislation, and prepare all procurement documents necessary to obtain this technical assistance. The&#13;
allocation of the technical assistance among members of the working group will be determined by the&#13;
working group. All procurement actions associated with each piece of legislation will be submitted to&#13;
the Bank for its no-objection as a package. A preliminary list of legislation has been identified for Year&#13;
1 of the project, as well as a tentative list of laws which might be covered during the life of the project,&#13;
and is attached as Appendix C. Loan fipancing is expected to cover up to $10 million of the costs of this&#13;
activity.&#13;
4.3           To address the issue of coordination of legislative drafting process in the Russian&#13;
Federation, the RFLR will commission two studies. The first will focus on an analysis of the existing&#13;
framework and mechanisms for coordination among the federal agencies and entities in the process of&#13;
legislative drafting. The study will identify the formal requirements and mechanisms designed to ensure&#13;
coordination among ministries, federal agencies, and the parliament and examine how these requirements&#13;
and mechanisms are implemented in practice. It will also examine the mechanisms by which draft&#13;
legislation is conformed to existing legislation. The study will identify laws associated with both effective&#13;
and ineffective coordination in the drafting phases for comparison. Based on this analysis, the study will&#13;
make recommendations on how the process might be improved, distinguishing clearly between short- to&#13;
medium-term and long-term policy measures which could improve the drafting process. The second study&#13;
will focus on an analysis of the framework for coordination in the drafting of federal and regional&#13;
legislation. This study will identify the ways in which the drafting of federal legislation which either&#13;
ir.fluence regional policy or are dependent upon regional and local authorities for its implementation can&#13;
be better structured to produce a more effective law. It will also identify what mechanisms exist to&#13;
ensure that regional legislation in areas of joint jurisdiction or solely regional jurisdiction conform to&#13;
existing federal legislation in this area. In this study researchers will also be asked to look at the&#13;
mechanisms and processes which exist to bring regional and federal legislation into conformity after a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14                                                     Technical Annex: Russia Legal Reform Project&#13;
conflict arises, so that the relationship between ex ante and ex post coordination can be clearly identified.&#13;
As in the first study, researchers will be required to generate specific recommendations on how the&#13;
process of coordinating between regional and federal legislative drafting might be improved in the short-&#13;
to medium-term, as well as in the long term. The terms of reference for one of these studies are&#13;
contained in Appendix D. The loan-financed cost of each study is expected to be $250,000.&#13;
4.4            To improve the drafting of regional legislation, training in legislative drafting and&#13;
technical assistance will be provided on a pilot basis to the Sverdlovsk and Orel oblasts, which were&#13;
selected by the Government according to the following criteria. First, the GOR considers these regions&#13;
(the cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg being excluded from consideration) to have clearly shown a&#13;
willingness to push forward with legislative reforms in the area of private sector development. Second,&#13;
these regions are not recipients of high levels of foreign-financed technical assistance. Implementation&#13;
responsibility will be assumed by the deputy governors of each oblast, heads of commnittees on legislation&#13;
of the regional legislative bodies, and staff lawyers of the oblast administrations. In addition, they will&#13;
be assisted by professional staff assigned to the project by regional authorities. These officials will be&#13;
in charge of determining lists of trainees and directing legal technical assistance to the appropriate&#13;
recipients. The RFLR, following consultation with the authorities of Orel and Sverdlovsk oblasts, will&#13;
contract for training in legal drafting for officials in each of these oblasts. Such training programs may&#13;
include local training, where both international and Russian experts are asked to train officials in the&#13;
oblast, and some study tours and additional training in Moscow. The training is expected to cover the&#13;
improvement of general skills in legal and legislative drafting, as well as substantive expertise in specific&#13;
areas of economic law, identified by regional authorities as priority areas. It has been tentatively agreed&#13;
with the regional authorities that staff lawyers from the executive and legislative branches, specialists&#13;
from economic agencies and potential drafters from local academic institutions will be the trainees.&#13;
4.5            In addition, regional officials may also receive some technical assistance associated with&#13;
the drafting of specific laws, upon agreement with the Bank. The project will finance technical assistance&#13;
in the drafting of regional legislation in these regions for those laws, regulations, and other enactments&#13;
which are included in the annual list of legislative priorities communicated to the Bank by the federal&#13;
Government in October of every year of the project. Tentative lists of areas/topics for the first year have&#13;
already been agreed upon between the federal and regional authorities of Orel and Sverdlovsk oblasts (see&#13;
Appendix E). There will be regional counterpart contributions. In the case of on-site training, premises&#13;
will be provided at the expense of local authorities, who will also cover at least part of administrative&#13;
costs and the cost of local transportation for the trainers. In Yekaterinburg, some instructors may be&#13;
provided by local academic institutions at their own cost. In the case of Moscow-based training, the&#13;
regional authorities will cover travel costs and standard daily allowances (Russian government rates) for&#13;
the trainees.  For legal technical assistance, counterpart contribution will consist of the expense of&#13;
preparing initial drafts of enactments (consultants will be stepping in at an intermediate stage), and also&#13;
of salaries of the implementation staff. The loan-financed cost of this subcomponent is expected to be&#13;
$1.5 million. Of this amount, approximately $900,000 will be allocated to training activities, and&#13;
$600,000 for technical assistance in legislative drafting.&#13;
4.6            Total costs of the legal drafting component will be up to $20 million, of which loan&#13;
financing will cover some $12 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Section IV. Project Description                                                            15&#13;
Legal Information&#13;
4.7           The dramatic increase in the legislative activity of the Duma and in the regulatory activity&#13;
of executive agencies over the course of the last two years has added urgency to the task of organizing&#13;
the Russian legislative base in a systematic and logical fashion. This component will finance the&#13;
development of legislative classification and codification guidelines by launching a feasibility study that&#13;
will analyze the current situation and propose a model classification system of legal enactments, as well&#13;
as a comparative methodology for carrying out subsequent codification. The study will be followed by&#13;
the pilot implementation of the classification system in electronic format. The study and pilot investment&#13;
together will cost $1.5 million. Terms of reference for the contractors, to be engaged through the RFLR,&#13;
are attached in Appendix F. This will be accompanied by and closely coordinated with a full-fledged&#13;
feasibility study and engineering design for a public sector legal information system. This feasibility&#13;
study will design a system which conceptually incorporates: a) both electronic and non-electronic systems&#13;
of informat: n dissemination; b) competitive access to databases of authoritative texts to private-sector&#13;
providers of such materials; c) timely and open access to as wide a sector of the population as possible.&#13;
The feasibility study will incorporate pilot and/or demonstration investments for information&#13;
dissemination. A technology advisor under contract to the RFLR during project preparation will develop&#13;
the terms of reference for the feasibility study, assist the GOR in the competitive selection of a contractor&#13;
to carry out the study, and assist the GOR to supervise the work of this contractor during project&#13;
implementation.2  Loan financing for this study is expected to cover up to $2 million, and the pilot&#13;
investment up to $4.5 million. The total cost of this component will be over $24 million, of which loan&#13;
financing will cover up to $8 million.&#13;
Legal Education and Public Education Campaigns&#13;
4.8           This component will support improvements in law school education. The number of&#13;
graduates and the type of legal education offered in state and private law schools in Russia today does&#13;
not meet the demands the society and the economy place on professional legal services. Law schools&#13;
rarely engage in modern interactive teaching techniques. Most schools use old style teaching tools, such&#13;
as lengthy textbooks offering little guidance for future practicing lawyers which are, moreover, frequently&#13;
outdated by the time they are published. Professors are rarely equipped to teach economic law subjects&#13;
and more often than not have no practical experience. To address some of these issues, this component&#13;
will finance grants programs for five law schools (to be selected by a consultative committee of the RFLR&#13;
based on agreed upon criteria, such as law school capacity, scope of curriculum, and extent and variety&#13;
of elective courses on economic and commercial law subjects). Within these programs, professors, and&#13;
groups of professors will compete for grants to produce innovative teaching materials, design new courses&#13;
and seminars, and participate in teacher training, including sabbaticals and study tours abroad. Students&#13;
of these schools will also be eligible for fellowships for graduate study abroad. Law schools will also&#13;
receive equipment for the production of teaching tools and materials, books for the libraries, and&#13;
computer equipment based on demonstrated needs. The RFLR will administer these program grants,&#13;
evaluate all grants proposals, and award grants. Throughout the grants program, it will cooperate with&#13;
the Methodological Committee (UMO) of the State Committee for Higher Education (SCHE). Appendix&#13;
G outlines grant categories in greater detail. To assist in the administration of the grants program, and&#13;
the development of grant proposals and their evaluation in the selected law schools, the RFLR will engage&#13;
one consultant per school for a period of one year. The loan-financed cost of this subcomponent is $6&#13;
2/     An information technology firm was placed under contract to the RFLR as a technology advisor in April 1996.&#13;

million of which $5 million will be allocated to the grants program. Each of the five schools will be able&#13;
to competitively apply for grants in each category, out of which equipment financing will be expected&#13;
not to exceed $500,000 in total.&#13;
4.9           Further, this component will support increasing public awareness about law and its role&#13;
in a market economy. The baseline study summarized in Appendix H clearly shows the deficiencies in&#13;
the understanding of the role law plays in market transactions among the Russian public, as well as the&#13;
gap in delivering messages to the public about the rule of law. This component will, therefore, finance&#13;
a series of public information campaigns designed to address some of these deficiencies.  These&#13;
information campaigns will focus on three areas: (i) public outreach through the mass media (TV, radio,&#13;
and printed media) and journalist training; (ii) public education about law in secondary schools, focusing&#13;
on extracurricular activities and events (such as competitions on legal subjects), dissemination of&#13;
pamphlets and brochires on legal topics, and professional outreach by the legal community into schools;&#13;
and (iii) public information campaigns about the availability and utility of alternative dispute resolution&#13;
(ADR) mechanisms, such as arbitration and mediation. The RFLR will engage consultants to carry out&#13;
these information campaigns. The loan-financed cost of this subcomponent is $13 million, with $7&#13;
million for mass media campaigns and journalist training, $4 million for secondary schools education&#13;
campaigns, and $2 million for public education campaigns on ADR.&#13;
4.10          The total cost of the component will be approximately $24 million, of which loan&#13;
financing is expected to cover $19 million.&#13;
Judicial Reform and Alternative Dispute Resolution&#13;
4.11          This component will support the training ofjudges of general jurisdiction and arbitrazh&#13;
courts. Due to the new burdens placed on the judiciary, the new role of judges in a market economy,&#13;
and to the massive amounts of new legislation, the training of Russian judges has significantly fallen&#13;
behind the current needs. Apart from insufficient training capacity, the current training of Russian judges&#13;
does not take adva.; age ol new interactive and innovative teaching methods and does not provide&#13;
guidanice on judicial skill building. This shortcoming is particularly acute for new judges entering the&#13;
courts of general jurisdiction (projected at approximately 1000 per year for the next five years) who&#13;
currently do not undergo any training. The Law Academy of the MOJ is in charge of providing training&#13;
for courts of general jurisdiction. This component will finance (i) two training sessions for 25 trainers&#13;
each (selected by the Council of Judges, the Law Academy and the RFLR, from among judges and&#13;
academics affiliated with the Law Academy and its regional centers) concentrating on the role of a judge&#13;
and judicial skills building; (ii) equipment for the Law Academy for the production of teaching tools&#13;
(including written materials and video tapes) and two computer classrooms for teaching computer skills;&#13;
and partially finance (iii) a series of five two-month long regional seminars for 50 newly appointed judges&#13;
each. It is expected tnat che Law Academy and its regional centers will be able to provide training to&#13;
about ten percent of new judges over the next four years, using the trainers trained under this&#13;
subcomponent. The RFLR will engage a firm experienced in judicial training which will cooperate with&#13;
the Law Academy in the development of the training courses and course materials. For the arbitrazh&#13;
(commercial) courts, this component will finance one training session for 25 trainers (selected by the&#13;
Council of Judges, the High Arbitrazh Court, and the RFLR from among arbitrazh court judges) and&#13;
partially finance three regional roll-out seminars on new legislation and judicial skill building for 50&#13;
judges, using the newly trained trainers. The component will also finance equipment for the production&#13;
of teaching materials (written materials and video tapes) for the training department of the High Arbitrazh&#13;
Court. The RFLR will engage a firm experienced in judicial training which will cooperate with the High&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Section IV. Project Description                                                          17&#13;
Arbitrazh Court in the development of the training courses and course materials. In addition, the RFLR&#13;
will engage a long-term (2 years) training consultant who will work with both the Law Academy and the&#13;
High Arbitrazh Court on designing innovative teaching materials and judicial training courses. Loan&#13;
financing for this subcomponent will cover $4 million, out of which $2.7 million will support judicial&#13;
training for courts of general jurisdiction through the Law Academy and $800,000 will support training&#13;
of judges of the arbitrazh courts. In addition, two computer rooms will be equipped for the Law&#13;
Academy at a cost of $150,000. An additional $500,000 will finance training consultant to be assigned&#13;
to advise the Law Academy of the High Arbitrazh Court. Appendix I outlines the format of judicial&#13;
education and tentative curriculum for both court systems.&#13;
4.12          This component will include a study on court administration and case management for&#13;
courts of general jurisdiction. The aim of the study is to analyze the current structure and adniinistration&#13;
of the courts, including the appointment of judges and court personnel, creation and elimination of&#13;
judicial districts, budget flows through the courts system, and management of the courts. The study will&#13;
also analyze case management issues, including the flow of cases through courts from the submission of&#13;
a claim through the execution of a judgment, identify the main bottlenecks in court rules and procedures,&#13;
analyze the division of labor within a courthouse and the organization of work of a typical judge. On&#13;
the basis of the analysis, the study will propose a set of recommendations to improve the current&#13;
administration of justice and service to the citizens through the courts of general jurisdiction. The study&#13;
will be commissioned by the RFLR and its preliminary recommendations will be discussed and consulted&#13;
on by the Council of Judges of the RF. After finalizing, the recommendations will be submitted to the&#13;
GOR for implementation into policy and will be disseminated in policy, academic, and popular media.&#13;
The loan-financed cost of the study will be approximately $500,000, including the cost of disseminating&#13;
the study. The terms of reference for the study are in Appendix 1.&#13;
4.13          This component will promote consensus building and supportforjudicial reform among&#13;
the judiciary through the organization of workshops for judges. It has been the Bank's experience in&#13;
many countries that the strongest resistance to reforming judicial systems around the world comes from&#13;
the judges themselves. Reforms of the judiciary, especially as extensive as will need to be in place in&#13;
Russia, usually do not succeed unless judges are involved in the reform process from the outset and feel&#13;
that they "own" it. To address this situation, a series of six workshops will be held which will provide&#13;
a forum for judges to discuss with their colleagues the needs of the judiciary, achieve consensus on&#13;
reform efforts to address these needs, and build a nucleus of leaders among the Russian judicial&#13;
community.  These workshops will also provide a forum  to discuss the preliminary results and&#13;
recommendations of the study on court administration and case management (above). Each workshop&#13;
will have approximately 100 participating and 10 presenting judges (including up to 3 foreigners) and will&#13;
include judges from all three judicial branches. The first workshop will be organized for the existing&#13;
Council of Judges of the RF, the representative body of the judicial professional association, totalling&#13;
approximately 100 judges. The first workshop will be preceded by a meeting of speakers presenting&#13;
judges with the workshop organizers to discuss the methodology and materials to be used during&#13;
subsequent workshops. The Council of Judges, in coordination with the RFLR, will identify the judges-&#13;
speakers for the workshops. The RFLR will engage a group of 3 professional organizers who will be&#13;
responsible for setting up the workshops, collecting and disseminating materials to all participants ahead&#13;
of time, engaging moderators for the workshops sessions, recording the discussions, writing up and&#13;
disseminating the results of the discussions to all participants of past and future workshops and the&#13;
Council of Judges for further dissemination to the judicial community. This dissemination will also be&#13;
in the form of a newsletter of the Council of Judges. The organizers will also be responsible for&#13;
administering anonymous evaluations of the workshops and individual speakers among participating&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

judges. The loan-financed cost of running these six workshops will be approximately $900,000. A more&#13;
detailed description of the workshops is in Appendix K.&#13;
4.14          This component will further support the training of arbiters and mediators in the&#13;
techniques of alternative dispute resolution (ADR). ADR in countries with sophisticated legal systems&#13;
is a useful complement to formal courts of law. They ease the backlog of cases in courts and provide&#13;
customers with a more expedient and less expensive dispute resolution. In Russia, ADR can play even&#13;
a more useful role by partly compensating for the weaknesses in the judiciary. To enable ADR to&#13;
develop more, a cadre of arbiters and mediators need to be trained in the methodology and techniques&#13;
of ADR. This component will finance (i) a six week training of twelve trainers in commercial arbitration&#13;
for the system of chambers of commerce, three arbiters and mediators for the Better Business Bureau&#13;
('Byuro Bezuprechnogo Biznesa") specializing in customer protection, and five arbiters and mediators for&#13;
labor disputes for the Labor Disputes Resolution Service at the Ministry of Labor; and (ii) three roll-out&#13;
regional seminars for chambers of commerce on commercial arbitration and mediation. The RFLR will&#13;
engage a firm experienced in training of trainers in ADR who will organize the training and co-organize&#13;
regional seminars using the newly trained trainers, and prepare all the necessary teaching tools. The&#13;
loan-financed cost of the component is $1 million.&#13;
4.15          Finally, this component will support annual meetings of arbiters and mediators. In order&#13;
to foster the development of ADR as a complement to the formal court system which would provide&#13;
useful service to the business community and consumers, specialists involved in ADR need to exchange&#13;
information about new trends and developments in ADR, local practices, precedents, techniques to&#13;
involve and inform the public about ADR services, etc. Unlike other professions, such as law professors&#13;
and judges that can rely on existing institutional structures for such exchanges, specialists in ADR&#13;
(especially at such an early stage of development as in Russia) do not have similar fora. This component&#13;
will, therefore, finance (on a declining basis) four annual meetings of arbiters, mediators, conciliators,&#13;
trainers and academics in the field. These four day meetings (including approximately 300 participants)&#13;
will be fora for exchange of information and experiences, and for workshops and seminars on new ADR&#13;
techniques and methodology, as well as opportunities to inform the public about ADR. The RFLR will&#13;
engage consultants who will be responsible for the preparation, organization, and content of these&#13;
meetings and for the development of any materials to be distributed at and after the meetings. The loan-&#13;
financed cost of this subcomponent is $750,000.&#13;
4.16          Total project costs for this component are estimated at over $10 million, of which loan&#13;
financing will cover $7.5 million.&#13;
Other High Priority Activities&#13;
4.17          Because the Russian legal system is in the process of transformation, the government's&#13;
priorities in the legal reform area are undergoing constant revision, articulation, and development. To&#13;
address this shifting nature of the legal environment, this component will support the financing of other&#13;
high priority activities in the legal reform area, including the preparation of future projects on which the&#13;
Borrower and the Bank will agree. The cost of this component will be $3 million. Several such activities&#13;
that have already been discussed with the GOR as tentative subprojects are listed in Appendix L.&#13;
Preference will be given to subprojects that meet the objectives of one of the defined project components.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Section IV. Project Description                                                             19&#13;
Project Management&#13;
4.18          Highly qualified professional staff at the RFLR  will be critical for effective&#13;
implementation of the project. The total costs of project management will be approximately $6 million,&#13;
of which loan financing s expected to cover about $4.6 million for consultants and operating costs (on&#13;
a declining basis) throughout the life of the project. As loan financing for project management declines,&#13;
the federal Government has indicated that in the event the RFLR does not find other donor financing to&#13;
cover other costs, it will commit to allocating resources from the federal budget to cover recurrent costs.&#13;
Budgetary financing has been requested for some part of recurrent costs for the second half of 1997,&#13;
which will correspond to Year Two of the project, when loan financing will decline to 80 percent of&#13;
costs.&#13;
Project Financing&#13;
4.19          The )roposed Bank loan of $58 million provided with 17 years maturity and five years'&#13;
grace period at the standard variable interest rate would finance 65 percent of the total project costs&#13;
(exclusive of taxes; see Table 4-2 and Appendix A). The loan would cover almost all of the foreign&#13;
exchange costs plus approximately $5 million of local costs. The federal Government would cover all&#13;
taxes and will assume full repayment responsibility under this project. Taxes for 1996 will be covered&#13;
by funds already transferred to the RFLR upon its creation, and tax obligations for 1997 have been&#13;
submitted to the MOF for budgetary allocation. Counterpart financing in this project is drawn from a&#13;
niumber of difftrent sources, including direct project beneficiaries such as regional administrations, law&#13;
schools, training institutes, and institutions associated with ADR. Federal budgetary allocations cover&#13;
larger percentages of the costs associated with activities such as legal drafting and legal information,&#13;
where loan financing is additional to activities which are already federally mandated and funded.&#13;

V. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMLEMENTATION&#13;
Project Organization&#13;
5.1           ImpleFmentation of all components will be carried out by the project implementation unit,&#13;
the Russian Foundation for Legal Reform. The RFLR is a non-commercial entity that has been established&#13;
by government and non-government founders (Presidential Administration, MOJ, MOF, Securities and&#13;
Exchange Commission, and the Academy of Sciences) to implement the project. The RFLR was created&#13;
in February 1996 by Presidential and Governmental decrees and registered in April 1996 by the Ministry&#13;
of Justice. The founders' meeting has taken place, and a President has been appointed. The founders&#13;
control the RFLR through the Council of Trustees, to which each founder nominates a representative.&#13;
Day to day operations of the RFLR are run by the President and by the Financial and Operations&#13;
Directors. The RFLR was encouraged by the Bank to have strong procurement and disbursement arms&#13;
reporting to the Financial Director in order to respond to the project implementation demands and&#13;
professional project officers reporting to the Operations Director. In addition, the President may be&#13;
assisted by an expatriate advisor. The governance structure of RFLR, including the statutory organs and&#13;
their main functions, is contained in Appendix M. The RFLR will be financed by the project on a&#13;
declining basis. Loan financing will cover 100 percent of the operating costs of the RFLR for the first&#13;
year of operations; the second year 80 percent, the third year 60 percent, and the fourth year 40 percent.3&#13;
5.2           The RFLR will be responsible for:&#13;
a) selection and supervision of consultants to carry out the analytical and feasibility&#13;
studies, organize training, provide drafting advice to both federal and regional authorities,&#13;
carry out public information campaigns, organize judicial workshops, and annual&#13;
meetings of arbitrators;&#13;
b) procurement of equipment for law schools under the competitive grants program and&#13;
legal materials for private arbitration panels;&#13;
c) publicizing and dissemination of the teaching materials and analytical studies&#13;
generated under various project components;&#13;
d) establishment of project financial operations, project accounting and asset control&#13;
procedures, disbursements and reimbursements from the Special Account (SA), and&#13;
reporting to the Bank on all disbursement and accounting matters; and&#13;
e) reporting to the Bank on all aspects of the project, including the monitoring of project&#13;
and program indicators.&#13;
5.3           To fulfill these functions, the following structure and mix of skilled professionals is&#13;
proposed:&#13;
3/     Percentages here reflect financing percentages rather than disbursement percentages. Financing of recurrent costs&#13;
will be reviewed during the annual work program review when the RFLR is expected to present expenditures for&#13;
financing each year which sum to the declining percentages described above.&#13;
&#13;

Operations Director will be responsible for execution of the four components. He/she will be&#13;
assisted by up to eight project officers who will handle implementation of each component. The&#13;
Operations Director will be responsible for coordinating the work of the project officers, to see&#13;
that the pace of implementation of the individual components is consistent with the anticipated&#13;
pace of the overall project implementation. The Operations Director will work with the Financial&#13;
Director to coordinate the flow of work between the project officers and procurement and&#13;
disbursement specialists.&#13;
1-inancial Director will be responsible for establishing project accounting procedures, in&#13;
facilitating the preparation of financial statements that conform to international standards, and in&#13;
providing general financial advice to the RFLR. The Financial Director will work with the&#13;
Operations Director to coordinate the flow of work between the project officers and procurement&#13;
and disbursement specialists.&#13;
Project officers will be primarily responsible for coordinating with respective Governmnent&#13;
agencies and ministries associated with each component. They will be responsible for drafting&#13;
terms of reference for consultants and contractors who will be hired to work within each&#13;
subcomponent. They will confer as necessary with staff specialists on procurement. The&#13;
component project officers will be assisted by project assistants as necessary.&#13;
Procurement coordinator will advise the RFLR in all aspects of the procurement process&#13;
including the preparation of bidding documents, bid evaluations, contracts with suppliers of&#13;

equipment and services. The procurement coordinator will also recommend institutional changes&#13;
to strengthen the RFLR's ability to procure services and equipment from local and international&#13;
sources.&#13;
5.4          In addition, given the RFLR's lack of experience with international and Bank procedures,&#13;
especially with regard to financial reporting and procurement, it is proposed that consultant support&#13;
services be provided to augment RFLR's capacity. An expatriate advisor will be engaged by the RFLR&#13;
to assist in a number of activities, including procurement oversight. A number of short-term consultants,&#13;
including expatriate advisors, may serve to augment RFLR's capacity, particularly in the early stages of&#13;
the project.&#13;
Implementation Process and Schedule&#13;
5.5          Implementation of this project will be phased in. Certain activities are anticipated to be&#13;
implemented at a faster pace than others; other activities, given their institutional development objective,&#13;
will be implemented as counterpart capacity is developed. The project will monitor the development of&#13;
counterpart capacity by monitoring progress against implementation schedules, as well as agreements&#13;
reached in a side letter to the Project Agreement. All components will be implemented over four years,&#13;
following loan effectiveness in mid-1996. Implementation processes and schedules will be reviewed with&#13;
the RFLR during the project launch mission in June 1996. Below is a summary description of&#13;
implementation for each component; Appendix N contains a detailed implementation schedule for each&#13;
component. Annex R contains a first-year implementation plan.&#13;
Legal Drafting. Implementation of this component will require the RFLR to obtain Government&#13;
confirmation of the proposed legal enactments for which TA will be provided during Year One&#13;
of the project by October 1996. For each of the legal enactments on the list, the RFLR will&#13;
confer with the respective working group in charge of the legislation (see paragraph 4.2 for more&#13;
details) to determine levels, types, and timing of TA. Based on this consultation, the RFLR will&#13;
undertake to carry out all procurement actions necessary to place consultants under contract by&#13;
June 1997. In the meantime, the RFLR will have agreed with the Bank (by March 1997) upon&#13;
operating guidelines for this component.&#13;
Legal Information. The technology advisor working with the RFLR will be tasked with&#13;
preparing TOR and advising the RFLR on a long list of potential contractors who could carry out&#13;
the feasibility study and pilot investment under this component. This will be carried out before&#13;
September 1996, such that the RFLR will have selected contractors for both the legal information&#13;
and codification studies and placed them under contract by November 1996.&#13;
Legal Education. Implementation of this component will be on parallel tracks. Contracts for&#13;
some of the public education campaigns will have been bid and consultants selected to carry out&#13;
the campaigns by September 1996. Development of the law schools component will take more&#13;
time, however, with emphasis during the first year of implementation being placed on law schools&#13;
selection (according to agreed upon criteria) and the assignment of education consultants to each&#13;
selected law school. The operating guidelines for the grants program (to be agreed upon with&#13;
the Bank) will be developed by March 1998.&#13;
Judicial Reform. Implementation of judicial reform activities will first be focused on carrying&#13;
out the first annual arbiters' conference and selecting a training consultant to work with the Law&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24                                                 Technical Annex: Russia Legal Reform Project&#13;
Academy and the High Arbitrazh Court. Training for the courts of general jurisdiction and first&#13;
judicial workviiops will get under way by September 1997, and operating guidelines for work&#13;
under the A\DR componient will have been agreed upon with the Bank by August 1997.&#13;
Implementation of the project will also be coordinated via annual work programs agreed upon with the&#13;
Bank. In every year of the project, the RFLR will prepare a detailed organization and staffing plan for&#13;
review as part of the annual work program. Financing percentages for recurrent costs of the RFLR will&#13;
also be reviewed every year as part of the annual program review. Implementation processes and&#13;
schedules will be reviewed with the RFLR during the project launch mission in June 1996. A midterm&#13;
review is scheduled on or about October 1998.&#13;
Procurement4&#13;
5.6           All Bank-financed works, goods and consulting services will be procured in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995), and&#13;
Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and the World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981)&#13;
respectively. International Shopping (IS) and National Shopping (NS) procurement will use commnercial&#13;
documentation acceptable to the Bank that will be adequate for later review and audit purposes. The&#13;
RFLR will be responsible for tracking procurement actions and approvals as well as periodic reporting&#13;
to the Bank on procurement progress. Additional details on expected procurement actions are provided&#13;
in Annex 0. A summary of procurement categories and procurement methods is shown in Table 5-1.&#13;
A General Procurement Notice will be issued in the second quarter of 1996.&#13;
5.7           The majority of procurement actions under the proposed project will be for consulting&#13;
services. To insure that the standard of consultants procured under the project is of sufficiently high&#13;
quality, the Government will submit for Bank prior review terms of reference not already prepared during&#13;
project preparation and shortlists for all major consulting contracts.&#13;
5.8           Technical Assistance and Consulting Services. Approximately 50 consulting service&#13;
contracts, anmounting to $45.8 million, will provide foreign and local technical assistance for individual&#13;
specialists/advisors, technical and feasibility studies, pilot investments, training programs, seminars, and&#13;
workshops under the project.&#13;
Legal Drafting ($12.9 million).  Estimated 18 consulting service contracts will be&#13;
procured on a competitive basis for technical assistance in legislative drafting, studies,&#13;
training programs, and study tours. Specialized ad hoc drafting assistance needed for the&#13;
RFLR or the working groups on specific pieces of legislation or regulations will be&#13;
procured on a sole-source basis with individuals for contracts below $50,000 for up to&#13;
$1.6 million in the aggregate.&#13;
*      Legal Information ($8.4 million). Three consulting services contracts will be procured&#13;
on a competitive basis for feasibility studies coupled with pilot investments in the&#13;
development of legislative classification and codification guidelines ($309,000 for the&#13;
feasibility study and $1.26 million for the pilot investment); and a public sector legal&#13;
information system ($6.8 million).&#13;

*      Legal Education ($14.9 million). Five individual consultant contracts of $200,000 each&#13;
will be procured on a competitive basis for the law school grants program, while the&#13;
public education campaigns will be divided into three contracts-$7.4 million for mass&#13;
media and journalist training; $4.3 million for legal education through secondary schools;&#13;
and $2.2 million for ADR.&#13;
*      Judicial Reform ($7.9 million). A total of six consulting services contracts procured on&#13;
a competitive basis will include $500,000 for a resident training advisor; $2.9 million for&#13;
training judges of the courts of general jurisdiction; $863,000 for training judges of the&#13;
arbitrazh courts; $754,000 for a study on court administration and case management;&#13;
$963,000 for judicial reform workshops; and $1.86 million for ADR training and ADR&#13;
meetings.&#13;
*      RFLR ($1.8 million). Individual consultants to be financed under the project include the&#13;
project officers, an expatriate assistant, and a translator. The RFLR will be responsible&#13;
for personnel policy and for supervision of the consultant selection process. For the&#13;
project officers and the expatriate advisor, Bank "no objections" will be required. Prior&#13;
Bank review will not, however, be required for the appointment of support staff.&#13;
Individual contracts will usually be of up to one year in duration but may be extended&#13;
by mutual agreement. To facilitate the Bank's replenishment of the Special Account, the&#13;
RFLR will set up a payroll accounting system acceptable to the Bank. Rather than&#13;
require documentation to support payment to each individual, the Bank will accept the&#13;
docun.entation certified by the RFLR covering payroll accounts.&#13;
*      High Priority Activities ($3.2 million).  Sub-projects under this component will be&#13;
submitted to the Bank for review and approval under procedures outlined in Appendix&#13;
L. All procurements for goods under this category will be carried out using NS or IS&#13;
procedures as determined by the threshold contract amounts; all procurements for small&#13;
works will be carried out in accordance with the special procedures laid out below for&#13;
procurement of small works, and will not exceed $75,000 per contract. As per Bank&#13;
Guidelines, procurement of consulting services will be subject to prior Bank reviews for&#13;
all TORs, and foi full review procedures would apply to contracts with firms over&#13;
$100,M0  and with individuals over $50,000. If consultancy contracts are sole-sourced,&#13;
they will be subject to Bank review as outlined below in paragraph 5.9.&#13;
The use of local consulting finns and personnel will be encouraged to develop the domestic consulting&#13;
industry. Bank-financed consulting services will be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines:&#13;
Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and the World Bank as Executing Agency, August 1981.&#13;
The Bank's standard bidding and contract documentation will be used.&#13;
5.9           Sole-Source Conti acting (SSC). SSC, as outlined in the Bank's Guidelines, will be used&#13;
to finance fellowsh;ps and other grant activities amounting to $4.9 million within the law school grants&#13;
program. The fellowships and other grant activities will be procured using SSC following a solicitation&#13;
of proposals from applicants of the five candidate law schools which, in turn, will have been selected&#13;
from an initial competition amongst law schools nationwide.5 Under the subcomponent financing studies&#13;
5/     Selection pro.edures of the nationwide competition amongst law schools and of individual proposals will be&#13;
elaborated in the operating guidelines.&#13;

26                                                         Technical Annex: Russia Legal Reform Project&#13;
on coordination of legislative drafting processes, the study on coordination in the drafting of federal and&#13;
regional legislation may have to be contracted on a sole-source basis. This is due to the politically&#13;
sensitive and highly specialized nature of this study and the unique sets of skills and cross-sectoral&#13;
knowledge required to conduct the study. Prior Bank review and approval will be required for contracts&#13;
with individuals that are expected to exceed $50,000 each and with all firms contracted through SSC.&#13;
5.10            Procurement of Small Works.  Small works totalling $533,000 are anticipated for&#13;
activities to be included in other high-priority projects. They are estimated not to exceed $75,000&#13;
equivalent per contract, and will be procured and awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from three&#13;
qualified domestic contractors in response to a written invitation. The invitation will include a detailed&#13;
description of the works, including basic specifications, the required completion date, a basic form of&#13;
agreement acceptable to the Bank, and relevant drawings, where applicable. The award will be made to&#13;
the contractor who offers the lowest price quotation for the required work, and who has the experience&#13;
and resources to successfully complete the contract. Such activities may include refurbishing, upgrading,&#13;
and configuring the premises, installing comnmunications lines, proprietary computer network upgrades,&#13;
and software. In addition, a small amount of financing may be used for small maintenance contracts and&#13;
for small repairs, such as window replacements and insulation. Prior Bank review will be conducted for&#13;
all contracts for works, regardless of value.&#13;

5.11          Nati.nal Shopping (NS) and International Shopping (IS). Procurement of goods in the&#13;
project- i.e., furniture, computers, fax machines, copy machines, and risographs-is estimated at&#13;
$886,000. NS or IS will be used as these goods are readily available, off-the-shelf items, and will be&#13;
small value purchaces for the RFLR ($151,000), two regional administrations ($25,600 each), five law&#13;
schools ($130,000 each), and the Law Academy ($157,500).  Spare parts for equipment and netware&#13;
elements may also be included. Since most contracts are expected to be less than $50,000, NS techniques&#13;
described in the Guidelines will be followed. NS purchases will be carried out by obtaining at least three&#13;
price quotations from different cligible suppliers. The first two NS actions will be subject to Bank prior&#13;
review. The othcr small value NS purchases will be subject to ex-post documentation reviews, with&#13;
payments being made using the Special Account and Statements of Expenditures. For purchases of goods&#13;
above $50,000, but less than $300,000, IS will be used based on quotations from at least three suppliers&#13;
from at least two different Bank member countries. Bank review of IS actions will be conducted on an&#13;
ex post basis during supervision missions or procurement reviews. In addition, the Bank will conduct&#13;
prior reviews of the first two contracts under both NS and IS procedures.&#13;
5.12          Recurrent Costs. These costs include compensation for RFLR staff and operating costs&#13;
for the RFLR. The staff proposed to be employed should be experienced, capable, and their terms and&#13;
conditions of employment should be acceptable to the Bank and are subject to prior review. Leasing of&#13;
premises for the RFLR should be based on obtaining at least three quotations from rental agencies in&#13;
Moscow. For all goods and equipment purchases which fall in the category of recurrent costs. NS will&#13;
be used for contracts below $50,000. IS will be used for contracts greater than $50,000 but less than&#13;
$300,000. In addition, the Bank will conduct prior reviews of all contracts of goods above $100,000.&#13;
As Bank financing will cover declining levels of overall recurrent costs of the RFLR, allowable&#13;
expenditures in this category will be reviewed and agreed to during annual program reviews.&#13;
5.13          Bank Procurement Supervision. The first two NS and two first IS purchases of goods&#13;
will be subject to prior Bank reviews and "no-objections," as provided for in the Guidelines. All&#13;
purchases of works are subject to prior Bank reviews and "no-objections." Procurement of consulting&#13;
services will be subject to prior Bank reviews for all TORs, and for procedures, documentation, and&#13;
contracting with firms over $100,000 and with individuals over $50,000. Procurements of goods and&#13;
services will use the Bank's standard bidding and contracting documents, modified or supplemented as&#13;
necessary, with Bank prior approval(s). This procurement plan will result in the Bank's prior reviews&#13;
of approximately 80 percent of total Bank funds committed for materials and equipment. In addition to&#13;
reviewing TORs, Bank reviews of contracting actions for expert services under the second and third&#13;
components will cover an estimated 80 percent of total Bank funding for technical assistance inputs.&#13;
5.14          Procurement Approvals and Reporting. A procurement coordinator will be engaged by&#13;
the RFLR to assist in the development of procurement plans and establishment of procurement&#13;
procedures. The supervisor will oversee the preparation of documentation, guide staff with planning, bid&#13;
packages, solicitations, bid/proposal evaluations and reports, contracting and the RFLR's periodic&#13;
procurement implementation reporting requirements.  The procurement supervisor will also help&#13;
coordinate documentation flows needed to secure the World Bank's clearances and "no-objections" on&#13;
consultants' TORs and equipment packages needing prior Bank review. In addition, Bank staff will&#13;
monitor procurement activities, contract administration, and project record keeping during periodic&#13;
supervision missions. Additional details on procurement can be found in the Procurement Plan in&#13;
Appendix 0 and Supervision Plan in Appendix P.&#13;

available for review by Bank supervision missions and auditors. A detailed disbursement profile can be&#13;
found in Appendix Q.&#13;
5.19         Accounts and Audits. The RFLR will maintain a single set of project accounts, including&#13;
the Special Account. Project records will be audited in accordance with the Guidelines for Financial&#13;
Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank, (March 1982). All project accounts&#13;
(including the Special Account and SOEs) will be subject to an annual audit by an independent auditor&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. The annual audit report will be submitted to the Bank by the RFLR within six&#13;
months of the end of the Government's fiscal year.&#13;
Project Monitoring and Supervision&#13;
5.20          The RFLR would be responsible for monitoring the project and would collect, review and&#13;
evaluate information regarding separate components and subprojects. The RFLR would report to the&#13;
Bank semi-annually on project implementation according to an agreed format.&#13;
5.21          Project performance will be monitored using: (i) outcome indicators for each of the&#13;
project's four objectives; and (ii) output indicators for each project activity. These are described below,&#13;
and outlined in Table 5-4.&#13;
5.22          Project outcomes will be monitored using both qualitative and quantitative measures of&#13;
achievement of the project's objectives. The four objectives are: (i) improve the quality of drafting of&#13;
economic laws, decrees and regulations by better analysis of issues subject to legislation and better&#13;
coordination among draft.ng agencies; (ii) improving legal information by classifying legislation and&#13;
identifying the appropriate framework for public and governmental access to laws, decrees, regulations&#13;
and decisions; (iii) iinproving legal education and training by introducing innovative training programs&#13;
and increasing public awareness of new economic laws and improvements in the legal system; and (iv)&#13;
improving judicial institutions through training, review of court efficiency and fostering alternative dispute&#13;
resolution mechanisms. These are discussed below.&#13;
5.23         Law Drafting. While at present there are significant numbers of laws being drafted in&#13;
Russia, technical quality is often low, conflicts arise between different jurisdictions and follow-up after&#13;
enactment is sporadic. The project addresses this by establishing an annual legislation drafting work&#13;
program, financing better input into drafts, reviewing coordination between agencies and national/local&#13;
jurisdictions. Outcome measures of the impact of the project on law drafting will focus on the quality,&#13;
timeliness and ease of implementation of new laws and regulations, and will include surveys to assess&#13;
these factors. Ou.tput measures will focus on the volume of laws and regulations prepared and on the&#13;
efficiencies in processing drafts within the Government.&#13;
5.24         Legal Information.  At present there are multiple, unconnected databases on legal&#13;
infornation, including legislation and court decisions. In addition, the lack of a coherent source of&#13;
systematically and uniformly organized official texts has lead to numerous private sector initiatives to&#13;
supply legal information to customers but these results have not produced authoritative versions nor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

inexpensive access to the public at large. The feasibility study proposed under this component would&#13;
clearly assess the costs and benefits of creating an integrated public-sector legal information system&#13;
against the costs and benefits of incremental ad hoc investments being carried out by the GGPU, MOJ,&#13;
and other federal and regional agencies. The outcome to be measured in this component would be the&#13;
differential between the investment finance saved as a result of carrying out a systemic feasibility study&#13;
at this stage against the no-project scenario of not having carried out a comprehensive review compared&#13;
against the cost of carrying out the feasibility study. The output of the pilot/start-up investment carried&#13;
out as part of the feasibility study could be measured by examining the completeness of information made&#13;
available by the pilot system, and the breadth of user access to that system.&#13;
5.25          Legal Education and Training. While a number of initiatives are underway to expand&#13;
law courses at institutions, they have not kept up with demand as private sector activities increase.&#13;
Outcome measures will focus on surveys and interviews of students benefiting from new teaching&#13;
materials and techniques. Output measures would examine the numbers and range of courses offered and&#13;
the students, teachers and officials being educated and trained under project programs. In the area of&#13;
public education, outcome measures will compare results from information campaigns with the baseline&#13;
survey. Output measures would examine the number of programs conducted, the amount of training&#13;
performed and the dissemination of information and public materials.&#13;
5.26          Judicial Reform. Courts are in critical need of facilities, resources, training and&#13;
improvements in court administration. Outcome measures will consist of surveys of judges trained under&#13;
the project, trainees and participants in judicial workshops and annual meetings of arbiters and mediators.&#13;
Output measures will include the number of judges trained, number of mediators trained and the rate of&#13;
establishment of new dispute resolution bodies.&#13;
Supervision&#13;
5.27          Supervision indicators are shown in Table 5-4. The project supervision plan is shown&#13;
in Appendix P. The plan includes a schedule for Bank supervision missions, the skill mix required, the&#13;
staff weeks input, and cost. An average of three supervision mission per year are planned. Staff inputs&#13;
will total 10 staff weeks for the remainder of FY96 and 40 staff weeks in FY97, 35 for FY98, 35 for&#13;
FY99, 20 for FY00 and 4 for FY01. A start-up mission with a launch workshop is planned for June&#13;
1996. A project completion report will be prepared by RFLR.&#13;

VI. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
6.1            The project's main objective and intended benefit is to reform the institutions which make&#13;
up the framework for market transactions. If successful, these changes will gradually lead to greater&#13;
overall stability and predictability in economic activities and will lower transaction costs by providing a&#13;
clearer and more comprehen.ive legal framework for the development of a market economy. To this end,&#13;
the project will finance technical assistance in four areas of law which are expected to yield the following&#13;
benefits:&#13;
6.2            Law drafting. The intended benefits of both components-the analytical studies as well&#13;
as the direct assistance for drafting-are expedited drafting of an extremely broad legislative agenda, as&#13;
well as improved quality of drafting. The economic benefits of such measures are difficult to measure,&#13;
as the benefits of both are diffused throughout the economy in the form of lowered transaction costs.&#13;
Lack of coordination and poor drafting imposes costs on the economy and reduces the effectiveness of&#13;
government policies, as in the case of cost recovery in housing and maintenance services (see Box 6-1).&#13;
The risks involved ill this activity are both non-project and project. Because legislative activity is&#13;
obviously sensitive to tI.e overall policy environment for reform, both activities can be influenced by&#13;
political events. In additioni, the specific component risk lies in the fact that better drafted laws do not&#13;
necessarily lead to better laws passed tirougli the legislative process and/or better economic outcomes&#13;
if adopted laws are not implerr.nted and enforced. The project seeks to address this risk through other&#13;
components whic;h are intended to influence the implementation and enforcement of laws.&#13;
6.3            Legal information. The benefits of a well designed legal information system are difficult&#13;
to define. It will undoubtedly lower many of the transaction costs that bedevil the Russian economy, but&#13;
its scope is impossibl to foiesee at this poinit. Perhaps the benefit of the proposed feasibility study&#13;
should be considered to be the savings from the cost of funds which might otherwise have been used in&#13;
ad hoc incremental investments in the legal information system. In addition, there are less quantifiable,&#13;
though equally real costs which might have been involved in the evolution of public-sector legal&#13;
information systems which either crowd out or distort the market for private-sector provision of such&#13;
services. There is some risk that following the feasibility study there may be no funds to carry out the&#13;
creation of a full-fledged system, but the pilot/start-up investment envisioned as part of the feasibility&#13;
study will be designed as a fully operational system which could be used on its own as well as part of&#13;
a larger system. The benefits from  project funded activities on codification and classification are also&#13;
difficult to quantify. Nor can they be assessed separately from the benefits of a well defined legal&#13;
information system, as well as designed codification and classification systems are a necessary inputs into&#13;
a legal information system.&#13;
6.4            Legal education. The costs associated with the grants component, such as the cost of&#13;
administration can be offset against a number of different benefits. Because the component is designed&#13;
to solicit proposals from law professors and groups of professors (potentially in conjunction with&#13;
publishers) within five law schools (to be selected), the component is designed to develop and encourage&#13;
bottom-up innovation. The beneficiaries of this activity are also concentrated in the younger generation,&#13;
and baseline research indicates that the generational group most receptive to change and reform in&#13;
attitudes about law is youth. Pilot approaches, moreover, are designed to enhance capacity and&#13;
receptiveness for further reform. In addition the component must be considered in the context of the fact&#13;
that top-down reform in this area, which might have been somewhat less costly, was not feasible in the&#13;
current policy environment. The risk associated with this design is that its impact could be limited. The&#13;
project seeks to mitigate this risk by concentrating the grants program in five law schools and by acting&#13;
as a repository of materials developed under the program and disseminating this information beyond the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36                                                     Technical Annex: Russia Legal Reform Project&#13;
Box 6-1: Legal drafting: the costs of lack of clarity&#13;
In the context of Russian federalism, local authorities in Russia (municipalities, for the most part)&#13;
have been given implementing authority in many areas of housing policy. One of these areas is cost recovery&#13;
for the provision of housing maintenance and utility services, most of which are provided by municipal&#13;
enterprises. The legacy of the Soviet period in this area included extremely low cost recovery for these&#13;
services, such that in 1993 cost recovery from tenants in some cases fell to below 5 percent of the recurrent&#13;
cost of providing these services. The federal Government has, in recent years, tried to create an enabling&#13;
legislative framework to allow cities to increase cost recovery-key to cities' fiscal rationalization, as well as&#13;
to more efficient provision of maintenance and utility services. This policy objective, however, was pursued&#13;
via ad hoc government decrees as follows. Government decree 935 was issued in September 1993 and&#13;
established an indicative framework for achieving cost recovery which suggested that tariff increases cover&#13;
20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 percent over the next five years such that cost recovery would be achieved in 1998.&#13;
The increases themselves were indicative; cities were free to set their own pace. The binding target was 100&#13;
percent by 1998. This was not fully understood by local authorities, some of whom saw these intermediary&#13;
increases as mandatory. As a result of the political outcry the Government issued decree 1329 in December&#13;
1993 to explain that cities were allowed to go at their own pace, taking local affordability issues into&#13;
consideration. Not only by this stage had the Government paid the "cost' of issuing two decrees instead of&#13;
one, the "cumulative' legal framework which emerged was now biased towards cities which might want to&#13;
lag behind the federal guidelines. As federal Government officials became aware of the fact that some local&#13;
authorities did not understand that they could exceed the 20-40-60-80-100 pace set by decree 935, in March&#13;
1995 the Government issued yet another decree. This last decree sought to reiterate that the guidelines&#13;
established in the 935 decree were not binding by invalidating that specific section in decree 935; but the&#13;
result in the localities was even greater confusion about the legal framework surrounding cost recovery for&#13;
maintenance and utility services. The cost of this confusion was continued distortions of municipal budgets&#13;
through subsidization of maintenance and utility services even as energy price increases increased actual costs,&#13;
continuing drains on enterprises who had to provide subsidies to maintain and operate assets (housing) which&#13;
in any case they were not entitled to own, and continued inefficient operation of maintenance and utility&#13;
services-as well as the cost to the Government to keep revisiting this policy issue in their deliberations.&#13;
five selected law schools. Unlike any other components in this project, the public information component&#13;
seeks to address the demand side of legal reform; by educating the public about the role of law in the&#13;
economy, the component seeks to create more informed and demanding consumers of law. There exists&#13;
a project risk that low awareness of law is not the only barrier preventing the public from relying on law&#13;
to organize economic activity; some of this risk could be reduced by the fact that other project&#13;
components are designed to address issues of implementation and enforcement of law.&#13;
6.5            Judicial reforn. The judicial and ADR training is intended to improve the quality of&#13;
dispute resolution service to the business community and the general public. The benefits of this&#13;
component are diffuse, as in the legal drafting component, since the lowered transaction costs of&#13;
improved dispute resolution are difficult to gauge. But users of the courts where judges have participated&#13;
in training financed by tht project can be surveyed to give qualitative assessments of the outcome. There&#13;
is some risk that the component is not large enough to address the breadth of judicial training needs, but&#13;
continuity of this activity could be spurred by the judicial workshops also included in this component.&#13;
In addition, some of the recommendations from the study on case management and court administration&#13;
will be a condition for receiving direct assistance in any follow-up activities. Also, both the training of&#13;
trainers and annual meetings and arbiters and mediators subcomponents are intended to foster the&#13;
development and increase of ADR panels. Users of ADR, especially the business community and&#13;
consumers, can be surveyed to give qualitative assessments of the service they receive.&#13;

6.6           No cost recovery is envisioned under this project. Many of the beneficiaries are in fact&#13;
government entities, such as the ministries and agercies involved in legislative drafting or the courts.&#13;
Some scope for cost recovery exists in components such as training, for example for ADR arbiters, but&#13;
the institutional complexity of arranging for cost recovery are high. This is because the assistance is&#13;
being carried out not through established institutions and channels, but through mechanisms created for&#13;
this purpose, largely through the RFLR.&#13;
6.7           Institutional capacity of the RFLR is a key factor in implementation of this project. Risk&#13;
attendant on the inadequate institutional capacity at the RFLR runs through all the components, to varying&#13;
degrees. As discussed above, the RFLR was chosen as an implementing vehicle for the project because&#13;
of the absence of any other one agency capable of cutting across all the areas involved in the four&#13;
components, and because not all the principals involved in the components are equally open to carrying&#13;
out activities which are designed to introduce reform. It is a newly created entity and subject to all the&#13;
risks of a new agency, but simultaneously enjoys the benefits of being outside of the civil service (and&#13;
therefore able to attract qualified specialists in an area where the differential between private and public&#13;
sector pay is particularly high), and designed a priori to carry out project activities.&#13;
Risks&#13;
6.8           There are substantial non-project risks that the consensus among government entities and&#13;
branches may dissolve or that relations could become politicized to such a degree that the passage of laws&#13;
could become difficult or delayed. This risk will be heightened by instability that may follow the&#13;
presidential elections in June 1996. While support for legal reform is widespread in Russia, different&#13;
parts of the government may have different areas of emphasis. There are also risks that implementation&#13;
will be delayed by inadequate government coordination, especially if the role of the GGPU is changed&#13;
or key personnel move. The project risks stem from the fact that many of the benefits sought under the&#13;
project are dependent on a number of different factors, not all of which are addressed in the project. For&#13;
instance, better drafts of laws resulting from the legal drafting component of the project can only lower&#13;
transaction costs in the economy if they are properly implemented and enforced. The project seeks to&#13;
mitigate some of these risks by trying to take a multifaceted approach to legal reform, by addressing&#13;
issues of implementation and enforcement, and also by including different institutions within the project.&#13;
As a result, the design is intended to allow other components to proceed (e.g. studies and training) even&#13;
if some areas are affected by changes in government commitments (e.g. legislative drafting).&#13;
Nonetheless, it must be recognized that particularly in a country as large and complex as Russia, the&#13;
proposed project could be only a partial contribution to the extensive and long-term task of reforming&#13;
the Russian legal system. While the risks of this project are considerable, they must be considered in&#13;
the context of the much greater detrimental effect of not carrying out the proposed project and&#13;
maintaining the status quo of the Russian legal system which does not meet the demands placed on a legal&#13;
system in a functioning market environment.&#13;
6.9           At the same time the complexity of the project introduces implementation risks of its own.&#13;
Experience to date in Russia with TA projects indicates that the outcome is heavily dependent on the&#13;
quality of the implementing agency, and directly upon the quality of the staff at that agency. Many of&#13;
the staff of the RFLR have held positions as senior civil servants involved in legal reform. Because the&#13;
RFLR itself is a new institution, it is difficult to prejudge how it will perform its functions. These risks,&#13;
however, are attendant on the vast majority of projects in Russia-to some extent they should be&#13;
recognized as non-project risks. A transition economy such as Russia either has existing institutions&#13;
which cannot be restructured to carry out the functions and tasks required of entities operating in a market&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Section VI. Benefits and Risks                                                                  41&#13;
economy, or simply lacks such institutions. If new institutions have to be created-the risks are&#13;
magnified by adding an institutional development aspect to almost every endeavor.&#13;
Sustainability&#13;
6.10           The project seeks to introduce reforms in a number of areas where such reforms have not&#13;
yet been attempted-public edlication in law, as well as innovation in legal education. There is some risk&#13;
that these activities will not continue to be carried out following project completion. However, the&#13;
project has been designed to focus on activities which contain within themselves the potential for further&#13;
extending reforms-public education will include training of joumalists, judicial reform will address the&#13;
training of trainers, and legal education activities will include the training of professors. To the extent&#13;
that the project focuses on new activities-such as clinical courses in legal education or workshops for&#13;
the judiciary-it is intended to demonstrate the potential benefits of such new activities. Sustainability&#13;
of such activities will depend ultimately upon whether the constituents for such refonn-law schools&#13;
which wish to establish themselves as centers of excellence, or judges who develop an understanding of&#13;
the role of an independent judiciary-begin to make such objectives their own. Project design has sought&#13;
to address such issues by, for instance, focusing the RFLR's work with law schools to a smaller number&#13;
of institutions, or by assigning an educational consultant to each law school. Until such time the&#13;
government will retain a role in promoting and facilitating such activities, including financing the&#13;
recurrent costs of the RFLR which are not covered by Bank financing.6&#13;
6/     Such responsibilities will be outlined in the project implementation agreement between the RFLR and the Ministry&#13;
of Finance.&#13;

VII. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
7.1           Prior to negotiations it was agreed with the GOR and the RFLR that the staffing selection&#13;
for senior RFLR staff would reach an advanced stage by negotiations.&#13;
7.2           During negotiations, agreements were reached on: a) the procedures and application&#13;
requirements for Bank financing under the high priority legal reform activities component of the project&#13;
(para. 4.17, Appendix L): b) the mechanism for agreeing to the annual work program (para. 5.5); c)&#13;
the holding of a mid-term review on or about October 1998 (para. 5.5).&#13;

APPENDIX B&#13;
INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE TO LEGAL REFORM IN RUSSIA&#13;
Over the last several years, several bilateral and international entities have been active&#13;
in Russia in supporting legal reform. These include:&#13;
(a)    The Bank: Under the terms of reference of the Soviet Union Technical Assistance Fund,&#13;
the Bank assisted the government by providing grants to prepare several key pieces of&#13;
legislation including banking law, privatization regulations, and petroleum law. The&#13;
Bank and IFC have also reviewed and commented upon various pieces of legislation in&#13;
the securities, bankruptcy, and commercial law areas.&#13;
(b)    Japan: Japan has supported preparation of the current Legal Reform Project through a&#13;
$2 million PHRD grant to the Russian government.&#13;
(c)    USAID: The US government has supported legal reform in Russia through several&#13;
programs, including one aimed at fostering the rule of law and democracy, which has&#13;
focused on passage of certain laws, as well as electoral reforms and training of officials,&#13;
among them judges and lawyers. Another program has focused on commercial law and&#13;
privatization, and especially on drafting assistance. One more initiative involved working&#13;
with the government on the draft of the new Civil Code. Lastly, a program run through&#13;
the American Bar Association has funded review of laws, twinning of law schools,&#13;
workshops and support for bar associations and jury trials. With the exception of a new&#13;
program dealing with crime prevention and criminal law, most of the larger USAID law&#13;
programs, which have totalled over $40 million to date, will end in 1996 or taper off in&#13;
1997. The US government has actively cooperated with the Bank in preparation of the&#13;
current Legal Reform Project and has funded several of the preparation studies which the&#13;
government requested. In the future, the US intends to structure its continuing legal&#13;
assistance programs in Russia, including support for criminal law reform, in a manner&#13;
which complements, and does not overlap with the Bank-financed activities.&#13;
(d)    Netherlands: The Dutch government has actively assisted in the drafting of the new&#13;
Russian Civil Code because of its own recent experience in revising its civil code.&#13;
(e)    Germany: German assistance has largely been in the form of legislative assistance, such&#13;
as on the Russian Civil Code, and legal training for judges and attorneys. Germany has&#13;

LEGAL DRAFHING COMPONENT&#13;
STUDY ON COORDINATION OF LEGAL DRAFTING PROCESSES&#13;
Draft Ternis of Reference&#13;
Background&#13;
1.             The Russian Federation (RF) is in the process of implementing a Legal Reform Project&#13;
(Project). The Project consist of four components: legal drafting, legal information, legal education, and&#13;
judicial reform. The overall project goal is to improve the performance of the Russian legal system in&#13;
areas key to effective functioning of market institutions. The objectives of the legal drafting component&#13;
include improving the quality of economic enactments, assisting the RF in the development of federal-&#13;
regional relations, improving legislative drafting at the regional level (through pilot activities), and&#13;
strengthening the legal drafting process and institutional capacity of federal agencies involved in legal&#13;
drafting. These terms of reference (TORs) refer to the latter objective and detail the consultants' services&#13;
(Services) that will be required to meet this objective.'&#13;
2.             The Project is financed, in part, by the World Bank (Bank), pursuant to a loan and project&#13;
agreements entered into between the RF and the Bank and the Russian Foundation for Legal Reform&#13;
(RFLR), the agency responsible for project implementation.&#13;
Objective&#13;
3.             Taking into account the current and future legal developments in the RF, especially as&#13;
they relate to economic and market-oriented activities, the consultants (Consultants) shall undertake a&#13;
comprehensive study of the legal drafting process and institutional capacities the federal agencies&#13;
responsible for drafting of legal enactments. Based on the above assessment, the Consultants shall issue&#13;
specific recommendations on ways to improve such processes and agencies' institutional capacities, and&#13;
be available for reasonable follow up discussions related to such a study and recommendations within and&#13;
outside government organs.&#13;
Services&#13;
4.             The Consultants shall perform the following Services:&#13;
(a)    Review the overallprocess of legal drafting, which includes the drafting of laws, decrees,&#13;
resolutions, regulations, and other legal enactments (legal enactments) by the federal&#13;
agencies of the executive branch, including the Government of Russia, Main State-Law&#13;
Administration, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Justice, and&#13;
other central and line ministries, government commnittees, etc.&#13;
1/     Consultants' qualifications to be considered during the selection process should include: (i) experience in legal affairs&#13;
and analysis on state level; (ii) experience in policy, governmental, and organizational fields; (iii) knowledge of the&#13;
Russian legal and government siructures, processes, and needs; (iv) depth and variety of knowledge of other countries'&#13;
legal and governmental structures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

(b)    Analyze the inter-agency coordination and cooperation of all key agencies involved in the&#13;
legal drafting process on the federal executive level (including those referred to in par.&#13;
4 (a) above).&#13;
(c)    Analyze the intra-agency administrative and operation processes of all key agencies&#13;
involved in the legal drafting process on the federal executive level (including those re-&#13;
ferred to in par. 4 (a) above).&#13;
Output&#13;
5.             Based on the above analysis and taking into account the current  political and&#13;
governmental structure of the RF, and, to the extent applicable, comparative experience of other&#13;
countries, the Consultants shall issue a comprehensive report which: (i) describes the current legal&#13;
drafting processes and inter and intra agency institutional capacity; (ii) discusses the key weaknesses and&#13;
needs related to the above processes and institutional capacity; and (iii) proposes specific and detailed&#13;
recommendations seeking to address the above weaknesses and needs. The report shall distinguish, as&#13;
appropriate, between problems related to legal drafting of laws, decrees, resolutions, regulations, etc.&#13;
6.             The Consultants' report shall discuss, among other things, whether and, if so, how institu-&#13;
tional capacity and legal drafting processes can be significantly improved through:&#13;
(a)    intra-agency organizational and administrative changes (if so, specifically, what kind);&#13;
(b)    improved inter-agency cooperation and coordination (if, so by what means, i.e., different&#13;
operational processes, electronic communications, etc.);&#13;

APPENDIX E&#13;
LEGAL DRAFI1NG COMPONENT&#13;
REGIONAL PILOT ACTIVITIES&#13;
1.            The Russian constitution reserves certain areas to exclusive federal legislative jurisdiction;&#13;
additional areas lie within the joint jurisdiction of the federal authorities and the 89 subjects of the Russian&#13;
Federation. All other areas fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the 89 subjects of the Russian&#13;
Federation. The current constitutional, political and economic environment in Russia has led to an&#13;
explosion of legislative and regulatory activity of the 89 subjects of the Russian Federation. Economic&#13;
activities are increasingly affected and regulated by regional and local legislation, which does not (at least&#13;
in theory) compete with, but complements, federal enactments.&#13;
2.            The increasing need to generate more regional enactments, the novelty and urgency of&#13;
this task at the regional level, as well as the complexity and diversity of subject matters that need to be&#13;
covered, especially in the economic area, greatly affect the quality of such enactments. An additional&#13;
element of complexity is the need to pay due attention to the constitutional balance between the federation&#13;
and its subjects. During project preparation, it was determined that, in addition to the overall factors&#13;
referred to above, there are at least three common impediments to effective legal drafting at the regional&#13;
level: (a) weak institutional and technical capacity; (b) insufficient access to legal experts with specialized&#13;
knowledge in economic areas; and (c) lack of financial resources.&#13;
3 .           Two oblasts, Orel and Sverdlovsk, were selected by the federal authorities and have&#13;
agreed to participate in the pilot program.' These regions were chosen on the basis of demonstrated&#13;
willingness to push forward with legislative reforms in the area of private sector development. It was&#13;
also determined that these regions are not recipients of high levels of foreign-financed technical&#13;
assistance.&#13;
4.            The Sverdlovsk oblast covers an area equivalent to the combined size of Austria, Belgium,&#13;
Holland and Switzerland. It is located in the north central region of the Ural mountains and is inhabited&#13;
by approximately 5 million people. More than 80 percent of the population lives in urban areas. The&#13;
capital of the oblast is the city of Yekaterinburg, the third largest city in the Russian Federation. The&#13;
oblast provides approximately 1/7 of the country's GNP.&#13;
5.            The political structure of the oblast government is similar to the federal structure. There&#13;
are three branches of oblast government: the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The executive&#13;
branch is represented by the oblast Government, headed by a chairman. Above and somewhat separate&#13;
from the Government is the office of the Governor, who heads the oblast Administration. (This&#13;
subdivision of executive authority is similar to the federal subdivision between the office of the President&#13;
and the office of the Prime Minister who heads the Government of Russia). The legislative branch is&#13;
represented by elected deputies who form the oblast Legislative Assembly, made up of two chambers.&#13;
The judicial branch consists of district courts and one oblast court. (Pursuant to the Russian constitution&#13;
and laws, the courts are part of the federal judiciary.)&#13;
1/     The cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg were excluded from consideration by the federal authorities on the grounds&#13;
that these cities have unique access to expertise and know how in this area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                                           Technical Annex: Russia Legal Reform Project&#13;
6.             The Sverdlovsk oblast recently adopted a charter (constitution) that defines the political&#13;
and legal structure of oblast government. This document was prepared in consultation with federal&#13;
authorities. Also, in January of 1996, the oblast and federal governments signed an agreement on the&#13;
delineation of power between the two levels of government.&#13;
7.            The Orel oblast, a mid-size agrarian region of about a million people, is located in the&#13;
"black earth" region of Central European Russia. It is in 60th place among the 89 subjects in population&#13;
and in 61st place in industrial production and 43rd place in agricultural production. In recent years, the&#13;
oblast has become known for its efforts at land reform.&#13;
8.            The governmental structure of the Orel oblast is dominated by the executive branch-the&#13;
oblast Administration headed by a popularly elected governor (officially called Head of Administration).&#13;
The legislative branch-the Duma-is relatively weak but is gradually becoming more active, especially&#13;
after the adoption in February of 1996 of the oblast charter (constitution). The judicial branch is part of&#13;
the federal judiciary. The oblast governor has recently been elected chairman of the Council of the&#13;
Federation (upper chamber) of the Federal Assembly while continuing to serve as governor.&#13;
9.            The regional pilot subcomponent would seek to improve the technical and institutional&#13;
capacity of regional authorities in the two oblasts by providing (i) training to regional officials involved&#13;
in legal drafting and (ii) technical assistance in drafting regional enactments. The training would focused&#13;
on training in general legal drafting techniques. Special emphasis and concentration would be given to&#13;
training in legal economic matters and administrative law. Training activities would take place with the&#13;
assistance of local experts within the oblasts, specialists from other regions of Russia, and, as necessary,&#13;
foreign specialists. In Orel, relatively more emphasis would have to be placed on training than in&#13;
Sverdlovsk oblast, as the latter is one of the centers of Russian legal scholarship. It has been tentatively&#13;
agreed with the regional authorities that staff lawyers from the executive and legislative branches,&#13;
members of the working groups on implementation of the pilots, specialists from economic agencies and&#13;
potential drafters from local academic institutions would be amnong the trainees. Specific commnitments&#13;
by the oblasts to facilitate training programs (guarantees of leave with pay for trainees, readiness to&#13;
interact with the RFLR) would be agreed to implementation arrangements between the RFLR and the&#13;
oblasts.&#13;
10.           For both the training and legal TA activities, counterpart contributions will be required.&#13;
In the case of on-site training, premises will be provided at the expense of local authorities who will also&#13;
cover at least part of administrative costs and the cost of local transportation for the trainers. In&#13;
Yekaterinburg, part of the local instructors' time may be contributed pro bono. In the case of Moscow-&#13;
based training, the sending party will have to cover travel costs and standard daily allowances (Russian&#13;
government rates) for the trainees. For legal TA, counterpart contributions will consist of the expense&#13;
of preparing initial drafts of enactments (consultants will be stepping in at an intermediate stage).&#13;
11.           Technical assistance would be provided after initial training activities have taken place&#13;
and sufficient progress is judged to have been made to utilize the legal technical assistance to be provided,&#13;
as described below. Technical assistance would be provided by either local, Russian, or foreign&#13;
specialists, and will relate specifically to draft enactments with strong federal-regional and/or economic&#13;
aspects. Regional authorities will have to submit to the federal inter-ministerial commission an annual&#13;
or semi-annual list of laws, regulations, and other enactments the drafting of which will require legal&#13;
technical assistance. For each proposed enactment, there would be a brief description of existing legal&#13;
and regulatory framework, needs and deficiencies in such a framework, a list of goals that would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix E. Regional Pilot Activities                                                             3&#13;
sought to be achieved with the passage of the enactment, proposed terms of reference for legal consultants&#13;
and a description of eligibility criteria and qualifications. It is expected that there would be much greater&#13;
reliance on local (i.e., Russian) expertise. Also, regional applications would have to clarify the&#13;
relationship between the existing federal laws and regulations and regional enactments (current and&#13;
proposed).&#13;
12.            A tentative list of areas/topics that might require legal technical assistance has been agreed&#13;
upon by the federal authorities and those of the Orel oblast. These areas/topics include the following:&#13;
(a) legal aspects of land reform; (b) delineation of federal and oblast jurisdiction in privatization and in&#13;
land law; (c) management of state shares in privatized enterprises (law and regulations); (d) various&#13;
model statutes pursuant to the federal law on joint-stock companies; (e) local self-government; and (f)&#13;
state registration of legal persons and of real property rights on the territory of the oblast.&#13;
13.            A tentative list of areas/topics that might require legal technical assistance has been agreed&#13;
upon by the federal authorities and those of the Sverdlovsk Oblast. These areas/topics include the&#13;
following: (a'. free economic zones in the Sverdlovsk oblast; (b) regulation of non-budgetary funds; (c)&#13;
creation of the Oblast Bank; (d) credit resources of the Sverdlovsk oblast; and (e) circulation of&#13;
promissory notes in the Sverdlovsk oblast.&#13;
14.            The implementation arrangements related to the pilot activities between the RFLR and&#13;
the pilot regions would nced to be satisfactory to the Bank and would, unless agreed otherwise by the&#13;
Bank and the borrower, include the following items: (i) grant terms of the assistance and the oblast&#13;
interest in participating in the pilot; (ii) specify to recipients of training and TA; (iii) counterpart&#13;
contributions; (iv) RFLR responsibilities procuring services to be financed under the subcomponent; (v)&#13;
implementation responsibilities of the pilot oblasts, including procedures, terms and criteria related to the&#13;
legal technical assistance and training (for TA these would be very similar to the federal procedures,&#13;
terms and criteria); (vi) responsibility of the inter-ministerial commission of the federal government to&#13;
approve the periodic oblast legal training and technical assistance program; (vii) undertaking by the oblast&#13;
authorities to issue an executive order (decree) appointing a regional coordinator (working group) for the&#13;
pilot and giving him/her appropriate powers; and (viii) reporting responsibilities of the pilot oblasts.&#13;

APPENDIX F&#13;
LEGAL INFORMATION COMPONENT&#13;
STUDY ON CODIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION OF LEGISLATION&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE'&#13;
Background&#13;
1.            The Russian Federation (RF) is in the process of implementing a Legal Reform Project&#13;
(Project). The Project consists of four components: legal drafting, legal information, legal education,&#13;
and judicial reform. The overall project goal is to improve the performance of the Russian legal system&#13;
in areas key to effective functioning of market institutions. The objectives of the legal information&#13;
component include improving the gathering, organization, dissemination of and access to legal&#13;
information. The codification subcomponent of the legal information component seeks to assist the RF&#13;
in identifying appropriate methods of classifying legal information (in both hard copy and electronic form)&#13;
and optimizing the uniformity and consistency of such classification across Russia.&#13;
2.             The Project is financed, in part, by the World Bank (Bank), pursuant to loan and project&#13;
agreements entered into between the RF and the Bank and the Russian Foundation for Legal Reform&#13;
(RFLR), the central agency responsible for Project implementation.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
3.             Taking into account the current and future legal developments in the RF, the objective&#13;
of the work of the consultants (Consultants) is to develop a classification system (classificator) and&#13;
methodology for codification ("svod zakonov") of Russian legislation. The work to achieve this objective&#13;
will be divided into two phases (described in the paragraph below). This TOR (especially the description&#13;
of services contained in Section C) covers only the first phase. Initially, the Consultants will be&#13;
competitively selected to carry out Phase 1. Upon the completion of work under this TOR, the results&#13;
of Phase I will have to be approved by the RFLR and by Russian experts and authorities, such as a&#13;
working group on the preparation of codification. Thereafter, the Consultants who will have carried out&#13;
Phase I may be selected by the RFLR to continue with Phase 1I without further competition.&#13;
4.             During Phase 1, the Consultants shall:  (i) undertake a comprehensive study of the&#13;
existing legal and regulatory framework of legal codification; the existing codification systems and&#13;
classificators developed and used in the RF by governmental and non-governmental organizations; and&#13;
other countries' codification systems (to the extent they are relevant to the RF); and (ii) reconmnend a&#13;
classificator for legal enactments of the RF that could be used both in a hard copy and electronic forms.&#13;
5.             Phase 11. Based on the proposals and recommendations of Phase 1, as well as on any&#13;
modifications resulting from reviews of the proposals by Russian experts and authorities, Phase 1I will&#13;
include the development of the classificator in hard-copy and electronic formns; testing of the classificator&#13;
11     These terms of reference describe the work to be performed by a consultant (individual or firm) to be selected and&#13;
hired by the Russian Federation, through the Russian Foundation for Legal Reform (RFLR) during project implementation.&#13;
The consultant would be engaged in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement and project agreement (which refer to&#13;
the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and the World Bank as Executing Agency, published in&#13;
August of 1981). and to be entered into by the Russian Federation and the RFLR, respectively, and the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                                           Technical Annex: Russia Legal Reform Project&#13;
among its users (such as courts, government agencies, law schools, and private practitioners and business&#13;
people); development of a lexicological analysis of the texts; and recommendations for a methodology&#13;
to carry out a full codification ("svod zakonov") of Russian legislative enactments and other normative&#13;
acts. Detailed TOR defining scope of work and services for Phase II will be developed by the RFLR on&#13;
the basis of results of Phase I and on further consultations with Russian experts.&#13;
Services&#13;
6.             The Consultants' Services under Phase I shall include the following activities:&#13;
(a)    Review and analyze the legal and regulatory framework applicable to legal classification&#13;
and codification in Russia. This would include, but not be limited to, the December 16,&#13;
1993 Presidential Decree No. 2171. Review other activities being undertaken by the&#13;
Russian government or other parties that may affect the development of a unified and&#13;
comprehensive codification system in Russia. This would include taking into account&#13;
work by major Russian scientific and academic research institutes to develop a&#13;
compilation of Russian laws and enactments ("svod zakonov") and related classificators,&#13;
to review the status and consistency of post-1987 legal enactments, and to review the&#13;
applicability and content of USSR laws in the RF.&#13;
(b)    Review  and analyze the methodology applicable to past legal classification and&#13;
codification systems in Russia. This would include, for example, the question of which&#13;
and how different legal enactments were classified and codified, including, laws, decrees,&#13;
executive resolutions and instructions, and regional enactments. Analysis should cover&#13;
classification and codification systems used in the USSR and, where relevant, in pre-&#13;
Revolutionary Russia.&#13;
(c)    Reviewv and analyze (through research and personal interviews with relevant government&#13;
officials, legal drafters, judges, deputies, experts, providers of legal information, and&#13;
users of legal information), the existing classificators and codification systems developed&#13;
and used in the RF. This would include, but no be limited to, classificators developed&#13;
and used by the Main State Law Administration (GGPU), Ministry of Justice,&#13;
Government of Russia, High Arbitrazh Court, Supreme Court, Constitutional Court, and&#13;
systems used by the private sector.  This work should include review of existing&#13;
classification systems through the method of systems analysis.&#13;
(d)    Analyze the classification needs for enactments of the subjects of the RF, (taking into&#13;
account the information being developed through other studies and activities conducted&#13;
under the Project.)&#13;
(e)    Provide comparative analysis of classification and codification systems of two countries&#13;
with comparable legal systems (preferably civil law jurisdictions) in order to assist the&#13;
RF in designing the most appropriate methodology for classification and codification of&#13;
legislation.&#13;
(f)    Make proposals for a comprehensive classification system  (classificator) of Russian&#13;
legislation at the federal and regional levels. In the design of the classificator, the&#13;
Consultants will have taken into a count the necessity to program the classificator into&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix F. Legal Infornation Component                                                        3&#13;
an electronic format.  Every effort shall be made that the categories used for the&#13;
classificator in a paper copy are compatible with and usable in the electronic format.&#13;
Apart from a general scheme of the system, the proposal will include detailed definition&#13;
of classification categories (to be used as a model) in several selected areas of law. The&#13;
selection of the areas of law will be agreed upon with the RFLR. In addition to the&#13;
RFLR, the Consultants will consult with and take into account in the development of their&#13;
proposals and recommendation the views of Russian and other users of the classification&#13;
system, such as judges and court personnel, government officials, academics and private&#13;
practitioners.&#13;
(g)    Prepare a task statement (concept paper) which would outline the design of the electronic&#13;
form of the classification system and explain how the system would be used.&#13;
(h)    Develop a computer-generated demonstration model (on limited material) that could be&#13;
used as a visual tool to describe the characteristics and benefits of the classification&#13;
system in both hard copy and electronic forms.&#13;
Output of Phase I&#13;
7.            The Consultants shall submit a comprehensive report which addresses all of the issues&#13;
identified in paragraph 6(a) through (h) above. Apart from the analysis referred to above, the report (and&#13;
its attachments) shall contain: (i) proposals and recommendations for a classificator, including a sample&#13;
of classification categories in selected areas of law; and (ii) the task statement (concept paper) outlining&#13;
the design of the electronic form of the classification system, with the demonstration model materials&#13;
attached.&#13;
8.            The Consultants shall submit to the RFLR a draft report (interim report) in Russian within&#13;
three (3) months from the time of contract execution containing draft proposals under items (i) and (ii)&#13;
in paragraph 7 above. Within a week thereof, a copy of the interim report (in English) shall be submitted&#13;
to the Bank. The Consultants shall meet with the RFLR within 30 days of submitting the interim report&#13;
to discuss the RFLR's, Russian experts' and Bank's comments and recommendations with respect to the&#13;
interim report. Within two (2) months of such discussions, but in no case later than seven (7) months&#13;
from the time of contract execution, the Consultants shall submit to the RFLR a final report, in Russian&#13;
and English, addressing the questions and issues discussed in this TOR, and taking into account the views&#13;
and recommendations expressed earlier by the RFLR, the Russian experts, as appropriate, and the Bank.&#13;
A copy of the final report (in English) shall be submitted to the Bank.&#13;
Qualification of Consultants&#13;
9.            The Consultants team  shall include lawyers with detailed knowledge of the current&#13;
Russian legal system and its organization, traditions, as well as knowledge and expertise in the&#13;
codification and classification system of other (preferably civil law) countries. Further, the Consultants&#13;
team shall include (or subcontract) experts in systems analysis and programmer(s) with experience in&#13;
information technology system building in Russia. Their expertise will inform the design of the&#13;
classificator and be central for the preparation of the tasks statement (concept paper) and the&#13;
demonstration model under paragraph 7(ii) above.&#13;

Coordination of Activities With Other Parties&#13;
10.           Throughout the time of the Services, the Consultants shall be in close contact with the&#13;
designated official(s) of the RFLR and other officials and experts referred to by the RFLR. The&#13;
Consultants shall also be in direct contact and consult with the representatives of Mitretek, Systems, Inc.&#13;
(engaged as technology advisors to the RFLR), and with the company to be engaged by the RFLR to&#13;
perform services related to the development of a legal information system in the RF. This close working&#13;
relationship and excharge of information is essential to properly integrate the analysis and&#13;
recommendations being developed as par', of the Services and those being developed under the contract&#13;
for a feasibility study cn legal information. It is especially critical in the preparation of the demonstration&#13;
model under paragraph 7(fi) above.&#13;

APPENDIX G&#13;
LEGAL EDUCATION COMPONENT&#13;
LEGAL EDUCATION GRANTS PROGRAM&#13;
1.           As part of the Legal Reform Project, the Russian Foundation for Legal Reform (RFLR)&#13;
will competitively award grants to five competitively selected law schools, and within each of these law&#13;
schools, to individuals, as well as to groups of individuals. There are six broad categories for which&#13;
funding is available and several subcategories within them. These grants will be awarded on the basis&#13;
of criteria agreed to between the Bank and the RFLR. The grant will finance certain activities deemed&#13;
essential to the reform of Russian legal education.&#13;
Category I Grants: Grants for Development of Teaching Materials andlimnovative Teaching&#13;
Methodologies&#13;
2.            A major problem facing teachers and students has been a lack of up-to-date teaching&#13;
materials. There is both a lack of materials for courses already in the curriculum and for new areas of&#13;
the law that should be but are not yet being taught.&#13;
3.            An additional problem with legal education as traditionally practiced in Russia is too-great&#13;
a reliance on lecture as the primary means of learning by students. Not only is this more inefficient than&#13;
having students gain such knowledge through reading. It fails to involve students actively in the learning&#13;
process. It also fails to challenge them to use the knowledge they are learning to resolve problems.&#13;
4.            Priority Substantive Areas of Law: Proposals for teaching materials in any area of law&#13;
are potentially eligible for funding if the applicant demonstrates the need for them. However, given&#13;
limitations on the amount of funding available, priority will be given to grants that address areas of&#13;
greatest need. Priority areas of the law are: (1) the law regulating private relationships among private&#13;
individuals and entities and the development of business and the economy, including such topics as&#13;
international trade, property law, contract law, torts, bankruptcy, enterprise organizations, and other areas&#13;
of private law; (2) the law of government regulation of business, such as securities regulation, antitrust&#13;
law, product safety, taxation of businesses, and privatization of state industries; and (3) skills necessary&#13;
for law practice, especially as it relates to representation of private individuals and entities engaged in&#13;
business.&#13;
5 .           Priority Based on Proposed Teaching Methodology: All forms of teaching materials and&#13;
all methodologies used is new courses developed in areas of law relevant to a market economy are&#13;
eligible for funding under this category. However, priority will be given to producing teaching materials&#13;
that (1) enhance efficiency in imparting basic knowledge by allowing student to read and absorb basic&#13;
legal concepts and rules outside of class rather than in lecture; and (2) emphasize concrete practical&#13;
application of legal knowledge to rcalistic problems through active involvement of the student in the&#13;
learning process in class. Not only is such a "problem solving method" more efficient; it also prepares&#13;
student better for practice.&#13;
6.            Also applications for the development of simulation courses will also be given priority.&#13;
Simulation exercises, also known as role-playing, are already an established part of teaching and learning&#13;
in Russia, both for law students and for lawyers, judges, procurators and other practitioners. However,&#13;
the use of simulation exercises has largely been for the purpose of demonstrating to an audience how a&#13;
particular judicial or quasi-judicial investigative process is carried out. There is a need to develop the&#13;
simulation method of teaching beyond its use as a demonstration device so that each student has the&#13;
opportunity to play the role of lawyer. There is also a need to expand simulation courses beyond judicial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                                         Technical Annex: Russia Legal Reform Project&#13;
and quasi-judicial proceedings. An important consideration for this category will be the role of practicing&#13;
lawyers both in authoring teaching materials for which grants are requested, and in evaluating grant&#13;
applications.&#13;
7.            Finally, law school libraries have suffered from the escalating cost of books and the need&#13;
for a wider variety of books and other materials that encompass new areas of the law that were of little&#13;
importance just a few years ago. Grants are available for the acquisition of various kinds of equipment&#13;
and books. Priority will be based on demonstrated need.&#13;
(a)    Grants to Individuals or Groups of Individuals to Develop Teaching Materials&#13;
Grants to produce up-to-date teaching materials suitable to train law students for practice&#13;
in limited areas of the law related to law practice to be listed based on survey showing&#13;
areas of greatest need. Preference will be given to materials that emphasize practice over&#13;
theory. Included within the category of teaching materials are interactive computer&#13;
programs.&#13;
(b)    Grants to Individuals for Development of Simulation Courses and Simulation Segments&#13;
of Other Courses&#13;
Definition of simulation courses: courses in which the primary mode of instruction is to&#13;
require that each student, as an active participant, assume the role of a practicing lawyer&#13;
confronted with a mock fact scenario that would face a practicing lawyer in real life.&#13;
Grants for developing entire simulation courses are limited to courses that cover areas of&#13;
practice suitable to teaching practice skills: client counselling, negotiation, legal writing,&#13;
pre-trial practice, fact investigation, trial practice, and appellate advocacy. Grants may&#13;
also be made for development of "simulation segments" for other courses (for example,&#13;
a course on International Trade).&#13;
(c)    Grants to Law Schools for Equipment Needed to Support Development of Teaching&#13;
Materials and Innovative Teaching Methodologies&#13;
Equipment to establish a local or regional publication capacity. Computer equipment&#13;
necessary for production of teaching materials. Video equipment necessary for a&#13;
simulation course or simulation segment.&#13;
(d)    Competitive Grants for Funding the Costs of Publication of Texts Through Traditional&#13;
Means (Including Translation of Foreign Books)&#13;
Funding is available to pay the costs of publication of a limited number of texts through&#13;
a regular publisher of such books.Books may be designed either for use by practicing&#13;
lawyers or for use in law school courses. However, to qualify for publishing under this&#13;
category, books must be practical rather than theoretical.&#13;
Some books that have been selected for publication by the primary governmnent legal&#13;
materials publisher, will be eligible on an one-time interim basis for immediate payment&#13;
of publication costs.&#13;

(e)    Acquisition of Books and Other Research Materials for Law Libraries&#13;
Funding is available for the acquisition of legal materials, books, treaties, international&#13;
legal documents and other materials for legal research.&#13;
Category 1I Grants: Teacher Training, Retraining and Recruitment&#13;
8.            Grants are available to individual teachers for the purpose of training or retraining those&#13;
teachers. Training must be for the purpose of (1) gaining teaching competence in priority areas of&#13;
substantive law or (2) for the purpose of learning innovative teaching techniques. Innovative teaching&#13;
techniques are defined as clinical teaching, simulation teaching or the "problem solving method" of&#13;
teaching. A grant for teacher training may be combined with a grant for preparation of innovative&#13;
teaching materials. Such a combination is encouraged as a means of assuring that training or retraining&#13;
will produce tangible results.&#13;
9.            Grants are also available for promising students and lawyers interested in a career in&#13;
teaching for graduate study that would qualify them to enter the teaching profession.&#13;
(a)    Teacher Training and Retraining&#13;
Formal training of teachers at another institution of higher learning. Sabbaticals or leaves&#13;
foi teachers for self-directed training.&#13;
(b)    Grants and Fellowships to Students and Others for Graduate Study Qualifying them for&#13;
a Career in Teaching&#13;
Grants are available to students with superior academic records and others for financial&#13;
assistance for the purpose of pursuing graduate study that will prepare them for a career&#13;
in law teaching.&#13;
Category  III Grants:   Special Grants for Major Changes in Curriculum  and Academic&#13;
Administration - Law Clinics, New Kafedras (Chairs)&#13;
10.           A limited number of special grants are available to make changes in the administration&#13;
of the curriculum that are somewhat more involved than text and teaching materials production and&#13;
teacher training and recruitment. These special grants are available to fund establishment of Legal Clinics&#13;
and new Kafedras to cover new areas of law, and to make other changes in the academic administration.&#13;
11.           Russian law students in their 5th year of study currently rotate through lawyers' offices&#13;
to allow them to gain some insight into the actual work of lawyers in society. As valuable as these&#13;
experiences are, none of them allows the student, under appropriate supervision, to actually assume the&#13;
role of a practicing lawyer. Legal Clinics, if permitted under local practice, would allow students to&#13;
actually experience being a legal practitioner.&#13;
(a)    Legal Clinic Courses&#13;
Definition of Legal Clinic Courses: Any law school course that involves law students in&#13;
actually representing clients in court or administrative proceedings, in legal negotiations,&#13;
in drafting documents, in giving advice or counselling or in any other legal representation&#13;
activity normally engaged in by practicing lawyers. Grants may be made to establish a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

new legal clinic or to continue or expand an existing program. Multi-year projects will&#13;
be financed up to a maximum of 2 years.&#13;
(b)    Kafedras&#13;
Funding is available to establish a new Kafedra on the Advocatura within the law school&#13;
of the applying institution or to expand an already established kafedra of that type.&#13;
Category IV Grants: Equipment for Law Schools and Law Libraries&#13;
12.           Russian law schools have suffered from the lack of basic office technology that has&#13;
become the standard for business, government and many other educational institutions.&#13;
(a)    Computer Equipment&#13;
Grants are available to acquire computer equipment.  An allowable expense of&#13;
computerization of law schools is the cost of establishing an electronic mail service.&#13;
(b)    High-Speed High-Volume Duplication Machines for Publishing (Risograph)&#13;
Grants are available to law schools for Risograph machines suitable for publishing&#13;
teaching materials under Category I.&#13;
(c)    Copy Machines&#13;
Grants in this category are available for the purchase of copy machines for use of faculty&#13;
and students at law schools.&#13;
(d)    Grants for Improvements for Law Libraries&#13;
Copy machines to be located in libraries for use by teachers, researchers and students.&#13;
Computerization of libraries.&#13;
Category V Grants: Grants to Law Schools for Lawyer Training&#13;
13.           Grants are available for law schools to organize training events for lawyers and other&#13;
personnel in government departments who need legal training. Since law schools have the facilities for&#13;
such training and often have the necessary expertise available from their teachers, they are currently in&#13;
the best position to organize legal training events for the staff of government agencies. To assure that&#13;
the latest issues of praztice can be addressed at such training events, law schools should be able to involve&#13;
prominent practitioners in those events.&#13;
(a)    Grants for Training of Government Lawyers&#13;
Priority will be given to training in those areas of law that have changed the most in the&#13;
last few years and which are most directly relevant to proper performance of the job of&#13;
the given group of government lawyers trained.&#13;

(b)    Training for Other Personnel&#13;
Funds are available for training events for other workers whose jobs require that they&#13;
have legal knowledge.&#13;
Category VI Grants: Grants to Produce Legal Education Materials for the General Population&#13;
14.          Grants are available from the Fund for professional outreach projects that propose means&#13;
of informing the public of their legal rights and the nature of the legal culture that Russian society is&#13;
striving to achieve. Because of their special knowledge of the history and nature of legal institutions and&#13;
of teaching methodology, law schools are a logical place to turn to for projects designed to educate the&#13;
general population about legal issues.&#13;
Booklets/Pamphlets and Other Written Materials for High Schools and the General&#13;
Population, and Ptblic Issue Forums on Television and Radio&#13;
Funding is available for Law Schools, in cooperation with local television or radio stations, to&#13;
organize public issue forum shows for broadcast or community education events (programs) in&#13;
the region where the law school is located.&#13;

APPENDIx H&#13;
PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS&#13;
1.           The preliminary results of the baseline study (Study) on public legal awareness and mass&#13;
legal education in Russia reveal wide gaps in the Russian population's knowledge with respect to the rule&#13;
of law, as well as in efforts to educate the public to such principles. The lack of awareness and&#13;
information is especially pronounced in the areas of civil and business law, which are vital to the&#13;
functioning of a market economy and the success of economic reform.&#13;
2.            The Study also indicates a pointed lack of respect for the rule of law, legal institutions,&#13;
law enforcement authorities, and key legal players such as judges and lawyers. The Russian public, by&#13;
and large, is unwilling to seek legal counsel and pay for it, especially conflicts occur.&#13;
3.            Nevertheless, the Study indicates that the Russian public is aware of the unsatisfactory&#13;
condition of the legal system, especially in comparison with Western countries, and shows that the&#13;
citizenry would like to utilize the existing legal system to the greatest extent possible to satisfy their&#13;
business and legal needs. Most of the interviewees expressed hope that a rejuvenated legal system, which&#13;
could emerge as a result of legal reform efforts, would be more useful and could be applied more broadly&#13;
than the existing one for their benefit and the good of society.&#13;
4.            Government institutions, NGOs, private organizations, and individuals surveyed in the&#13;
Study currently are not involved in mass information and education efforts in the area of law as the basis&#13;
for economic and business relations. However, many expressed willingness to participate in an&#13;
education/information campaign to boost public knowledge about civil and commercial law to help alter&#13;
existing widespread patterns of behavior that militate against the successful implantation of a market&#13;
economy in Russia.&#13;
Summary of Key Findings&#13;
3     The Russian public does not yet see the law as the primary framework for economic and&#13;
business relationships. The vast majority of the nation fundamentally distrusts both the&#13;
law enforcement and the court system. Russians routinely underutilized the judiciary to&#13;
resolve business disputes, and do not consider Russia as a country governed by law.&#13;
*     The media's coverage of legal topics, especially in the areas of business and commercial&#13;
law, is limited and deficient in content. The overwhelming majority of Russian&#13;
journalists in the field lack the basic knowledge, understanding, and research skills&#13;
required to analyze and write about law as it functions in a democratic market society.&#13;
*     Texts of even the most basic laws are not widely available in libraries. Commentaries&#13;
on law, compilations of legal precedent, and application guidelines for legal practice are&#13;
in extremely narrow circulation. Books on legal subjects for lay readers, practical&#13;
brochures, overviews of the Russian legal system, and legal how-to manuals for&#13;
entrepreneurs are in such extreme short supply as to have virtually no impact on a lasting&#13;
scale.&#13;
*     Electronic legal databases exist but are affordable only by large corporations and private&#13;
law firms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                                           Technical Annex: Russia Legal Reform Project&#13;
*      Today in Russia there are no sustained educational or mass information programs on&#13;
business and commercial law, or business dispute resolution, being carried out by either&#13;
government bodies, NGOs, private organizations, or individuals.&#13;
*      Key informants and focus group respondents felt that broad-based efforts to increase&#13;
public understanding of law as the basis for economic and business activity in society are&#13;
necessary. Such a campaign would draw support across party and political lines and may&#13;
be a rallying point for legal reform generally.&#13;
Study Outline&#13;
5.            The Study included the following six components:&#13;
*      in-depth attitudinal research, consisting of a representative poll of the adult urban&#13;
population (n= 1,200) of the Russian Federation and 8 focus groups drawn from the&#13;
general population and elites, including lawyers, managers and government officials. The&#13;
focus groups were spread between the capital and a provincial town;&#13;
*      content analysis of the electronic broadcast media;&#13;
*      content analysis of the capital city and provincial press;&#13;
*      in-depth interviews with Russian institutions dealing with public legal education and&#13;
information issues;&#13;
*      a detailed library and bibliography survey of mass education materials; and&#13;
*      evaluations by legal experts, social researchers, and journalists of key media programs&#13;
and publications on legal topics for non-lawyers.&#13;
6.            The results of opinion research paint a rather bleak picture of legal education and&#13;
information accessibility in Russia.&#13;
*      81 percent of the respondents consider that they are insufficiently informed or completely&#13;
uninformed as to their civil rights, including property rights and other laws underlying&#13;
business and economic activity.&#13;
*      Only 11 percent of the population consider themselves "sufficiently informed" or "close&#13;
to sufficiently" informed of the legal framework and their rights.&#13;
*      79 percent consider their property to be insufficiently protected, or that the laws which&#13;
protect their property are faulty.&#13;
*      Over 70 percent of the entrepreneurs involved in the focus groups said that business&#13;
conflicts are resolved through criminal means and bribes rather than through the courts.&#13;
*      A significant majority of the respondents (59 percent) consider that the existing laws do&#13;
not sufficiently protect property rights&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix H. Public Education Campaigns                                                     3&#13;
*     Over 58 percent "somewhat" mistrust the militia (the police), while 28 percent of the&#13;
respondents completely mistrust it. Only 6 percent "completely trust" it.&#13;
*     While over 51 percent believe that business disputes are resolved through bribes and&#13;
organized criminal structures, only 8 percent believe that they are resolved through the&#13;
courts.&#13;
*     52 percent of the respondents do not trust the court system, while only 28 percent trust&#13;
it "somewhat. "&#13;
7.            The findings of the focus groups indicated that Russians do not consider Russia a rule of&#13;
law state. Respondents considered a rule of law state one where laws are of high quality, where a&#13;
mechanism to observe and enforce laws exists, where the populace is well-informed about these laws,&#13;
and where both law enforcement organs and the courts are well-informed and highly professional.&#13;
8.            Focus group participants expressed the majority view that the school system does not&#13;
provide the basics for understanding the role of law in a market society. They indicated that those&#13;
newspapers which cover legal topics are accessible to only a very small part of the population. They also&#13;
noted that television does not provide adequate information on legal topics, neither through news,&#13;
documentary, nor dramatic programming.&#13;
9.            Opinion research indicates that the tendency to seek legal advice (and to pay for it) is&#13;
still extremely weak. Respondents further indicated a lack of willingness to pay for legal information,&#13;
expressing the view that one is "entitled" to this as a "right" and also that people "deserve" access to law.&#13;
10.          Media content analysis showed that the situation in television is especially grave, with&#13;
little or no time spent on new legislation or important legal issues impacting the public. Also, such&#13;
central newspapers as Izvestiya, Finansovye Izvvestiya, Finansovaya Gazeta, Kommersant-Daily,&#13;
Nezavisimaya Gazeta and many other, as well as local newspapers from Voronezh and Chelyabinsk&#13;
regions were screened. Legal topics are covered in a sporadic fashion, evidencing little to no grasp of&#13;
the issues on the part of the journalists. The only exception mentioned is the Izvestiya-Ekspertiza&#13;
supplement, which offers extensive coverage of legal issues, especially in the securities area, though this&#13;
is primarily consumed by elites.&#13;
11.          For the purposes of the Study, libraries in Moscow and Vladimir were examined at&#13;
random against an all-Russian list of popular and professional legal literature publications for the years&#13;
1992-1995:&#13;
*     Between 1992-1995 a total of about 1,000 books on legal issues were published, which&#13;
is a fraction of the number in some other transition economies.&#13;
*     About 30 percent of these books are texts of laws and regulations; 14 percent are&#13;
commentaries to laws; textbooks were 10 percent; methodological publications 14&#13;
percent; about 10 percent are legal dictionaries and other information literature.&#13;
*     In city and region libraries, only 30 percent of these books were available; in some legal&#13;
disciplines there were none available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

*     The study noted high demand for books on legal topics - up to 30 percent of the total&#13;
books demanded in libraries.&#13;
12.          Good books on legal subjects for elementary, secondary and high schools are practically&#13;
non-existent. Due to the interest in the abuses of the Soviet regime, most of the books that are available&#13;
tend to focus on constitutional law and human rights. These issues receive the lion's share of attention&#13;
from the donor community, such as the Soros Foundation, the Council of Europe and the U.N. School&#13;
books dealing with civil and commercial law simply do not exist.&#13;
13.          In-depth interviews with key executives and decision makers in the Russian government,&#13;
including law enforcement institutions and procuracy (Attorney General's Office), educational authorities,&#13;
Russian and Western NGOs demonstrated that many of interviewees in the educational and NGO sectors&#13;
felt that Russian society desperately needs a campaign to educate the public about the law, and business&#13;
and economic law in particular. Both the government institutions and the NGOs have the capacity to be&#13;
involved in such efforts, but are lacking Western expertise in mass communications and public relations,&#13;
and are in need of adequate resources to engage in sustained activities.&#13;
14.           Based upon the Study, the Russian legal professionals involved formulated several&#13;
messages that need to reach the Russian public in order to stimulate the utilization of business and&#13;
commnercial law and develop legal institutions:&#13;
*     Laws exist in order to regulate relations between people, including those in business and&#13;
economic affairs, and to protect their rights. Part of this message is that market does not&#13;
equal chaos. It means that the rule of law exists in order to regulate market relations.&#13;
This also includes communicating the basic understanding that there are laws regulating&#13;
relations between buyer and seller, lender and borrower, and lessor and renter, etc.&#13;
e     The purpose of the law is to increase the security of business transactions and make them&#13;
more predictable. This includes communicating the point that legal information can be&#13;
acquired and understood by everyone (or by their counsel). This is a broad message that&#13;
applies across the board to different types of transactions and to different aspects of&#13;
market behavior (trading in consumer goods and commodities, real estate, securities&#13;
transactions, etc.).&#13;
*     A contract is an agreement between two or more parties, especially one that is written&#13;
and enforceable under the law.  Contracts exist to regulate relations in particular&#13;
transactions, while the law broadly defines the rights and obligations of parties to&#13;
transactions. Contracts exist in order to prevent disputes. This message should also&#13;
include the need to observe and enforce contracts.&#13;
*     Disputes can and should be resolved by applying laws and stipulations of contract. The&#13;
fora for dispute resolution can be the courts, including the arbitrage courts, or ADR,&#13;
such as commercial arbitration (treteyskiye study) sponsored by professional&#13;
organizations, for example, chambers of commerce.&#13;
*     The functions of the legal profession and independent judiciary must be explained, and&#13;
its prestige enhanced. Increased use of the legal profession and institutions by the&#13;
Russian public must be promoted, with special emphasis on business transactions and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Appendix H. Public Education Campaigns                                                       5&#13;
economic behavior. A particularly high profile should be assigned to ADR as the means&#13;
to promote civilized relations in the market sector.&#13;
*      The population needs to be informed as to how the legal system of the country is&#13;
structured; what the branches of law and legal institutions are; where and how to access&#13;
legal information concerning at least simple economic transactions such as the buying and&#13;
selling of apartments, opening small business, or signing labor contracts.&#13;

APPENDIX I&#13;
JUDICIAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS&#13;
1.            The judicial education' and training component of the Project has two parts: one targeted&#13;
at the courts of general jurisdiction (CGJ) and its training institution, the Law Academy of the Ministry&#13;
of Justice (Law Academy); the other at the arbitrazh (commercial) courts. While the education format&#13;
is very similar for the two separate court systems, it is not identical; in the case of CGJ, greater emphasis&#13;
is placed on newly appointed judges and the development of their judicial skills. For both court systems,&#13;
the Project would initially finance training-of-trainers (TOT) programs for judicial educators from among&#13;
judges and academics. In the second stage, the Project would finance roll-out seminars for judges in&#13;
which the newly-trained judicial educators would form the core faculty.&#13;
Courts of General Jurisdiction&#13;
Training Judicial Educators&#13;
2.            Selection of Trainers: The Target Group. A maximum of 25 trainers/educators will be&#13;
selected, consisting mainly of CGJ judges, with a few judicial educators affiliated with the Law Academy&#13;
or its regional centers. The trainers will be chosen for their potential as leaders in judicial reform and&#13;
will form the nucleus of a judicial education faculty for Russia. This group should be representative of&#13;
the geographic regions of Russia, with no more than four judges/educators from Moscow. The TOT&#13;
would be repeated twice over the life of the Project, in consecutive years, for a different group of 25&#13;
judges/educators each year.&#13;
3.            Part 1: External Training Curriculum. Part I of the TOT will be an intensive two-week&#13;
program held outside of Russia for 25 trainers/educators. The curriculum would include the definition&#13;
and development of: judicial education objectives; judicial education standards; needs assessments; long-&#13;
range strategic planning; judicial reform process - connecting to the community; orientation programs;&#13;
"marketing" of judicial education; curriculum development (introduction of required content of programs&#13;
on judicial independence, the role of the judge, the relationship between the media and the judiciary,&#13;
judicial ethics on and off the bench, judicial accountability to the public, codes of judicial conduct, case&#13;
flow management, the science of fact finding, judicial reasoning, judicial skills (efficient and impartial&#13;
chairmanship, sensitivity to the needs of witnesses, litigants, and the public, ensuring the rules of natural&#13;
justice are enforced), stress management and adapting to change, the exercise of judicial discretion,&#13;
judicial activism, elements, and practice of the adversarial system, and computer skills for judges).&#13;
4.            Part lI: Internal Training Curriculum. Part II of the TOT will be a four-week collegial&#13;
programn held within Russia for the same group of 25 judges/judicial educators who successfully&#13;
completed Part I. Further study of substantive topics of law would be included in the curriculum, as&#13;
would practicing teaching methodologies and styles, and the development of personal teaching tools.&#13;
I/    In the context of this Project, judicial education will be defined as collegial meetings (national, regional, and local),&#13;
training seminars/workshops, and all professional information-be it in print, audio, video, computer disk, on-line, or mentoring&#13;
feedback-received by the judge.&#13;

STLIDY ON COUIRT ADMINISTRATION AND CASE MANAGEMENT&#13;
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
Objective&#13;
1.              The purpose of the study is to describe and analyze the principal aspects of the operation,&#13;
administration, and financing of the courts of general jurisdiction (CGJ) and the case-flow management&#13;
in these courts and, on the basis of such analysis, make recommendations for improving their&#13;
performance'.&#13;
Background&#13;
2.              The Russian Federation (RF) is in the process of implementing a Legal Reform Project&#13;
(Project). The Project consists of four components: support for legal drafting, legal information and&#13;
codification, legal education, including public information campaigns, and judicial reform, including&#13;
support for alternative dispute resolution (ADR). The overall Project goal is to improve the performance&#13;
of the Russian legal system in areas key to etfective functioning of market institutions. Among the&#13;
activities to be conducted under the judicial reform component of the Project is this study.&#13;
3.              The study will focus on CGJ. The experience of the commercial (arbitrazh) courts can&#13;
be used for comparison as well as taken into account in making recommendations for the CGJ. The study&#13;
is not to primarily focus on the operation of criminal law and procedures used by the courts of general&#13;
jurisdiction in carrying out the law of criminal procedures, except in so far as those procedures are&#13;
common to or inextricably involved with the procedures used to conduct the responsibilities of the courts&#13;
for non-criminal law cases2.&#13;
4.              Some of the findings and recommendations of the study may be tested on a pilot basis&#13;
under the Project. The recommendations may also be a basis for the design of programs to be carried out&#13;
with the assistance of entities other than the World Bank.   The Consultants will also make&#13;
recommendations to the RFLR on how to disseminate the findings and recommendations of the study.&#13;
5.              Throughout the study, the Consultants will give consideration to whether any legislative&#13;
changes are necessary to ensure adherence to the reforms recommended by the Consultants. If yes, the&#13;
Consultants will outline the nature and extent of such legislative changes.&#13;
1/      The study is not responsible for designing activities to carry out the recommendations nor preparing detailed budgets&#13;
for their implementation.&#13;
2/      Appendix A sets forth a very short description of the composition and size of the three court systems of the Russian&#13;
Federation. The following existing documents should be reviewed and consulted by the organization which will&#13;
conduct this study: (i) Parts One and Two of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation as amended March 1, 1996;&#13;
( ii) Russian Federation Code of Civil Procedures as amended November 30, 1995; (iii) Procedure Code for the&#13;
Russian Commercial Courts as amended July 1, 1995; (iv) Collected Resolutions of the Russian Federation Supreme&#13;
Court (1993 edition); (v) Instructions of the Russian Federation Ministry of Justice; and (vi) Draft of the Russian&#13;

Summary Description of the Composition and Size of the Court Systems of the Russian&#13;
Federation&#13;
There are three court systems in the Russian Federation (RF): (i) the Constitutional Court (one on&#13;
the federal level; some republics, subjects of the RF, have separate constitutional courts); (ii) the&#13;
courts of general jurisdiction (three instances, the highest of which is the Supreme Court of the RF);&#13;
and (iii) the arbitrazh (commercial) courts (also three instances, the highest of which is the High&#13;
Arbitrazh Court). Each system is organized and operated independently with separate funding&#13;
sources and administrations.&#13;
There is no unified or even similar structure for administering, operating, and financing the various&#13;
courts. The Constitutional Court is directly funded from the federal budget and administered&#13;
independently from the other courts. The High Arbitrazh Court receives a separate budgetary&#13;
allocation for all the three instances of courts. The first two instances of courts of general&#13;
jurisdiction are administratively and financially subordinate to the Ministry of Justice (MOJ); their&#13;
budget is channelled through the MOJ. Their third instance, the Supreme Court of the RF,&#13;
however, is funded directly from the federal budget and administered independently. This structure&#13;
makes the arbitrazh courts (which are transformed from the former 'state arbitrazh' -- a quasi-&#13;
judicial executive agency vested with resolving disputed among state-owned enterprises) fiscally&#13;
better off and institutionally easier to administer and manage than the courts of general jurisdiction.&#13;
Jurisdictional lines between the courts are laid out by the Constitution of the RF and are further&#13;
elaborated in specific laws. There is, however, a substantial jurisdictional overlap between the&#13;
general jurisdiction and arbitrazh court system in economic disputes.&#13;
As mentioned, the system of courts of general jurisdiction is comprised of three levels, each of&#13;
which has original jurisdiction over some cases. There are 2,500 trial courts manned by&#13;
approximately 12,000 judges in the first instance courts, about 3,000 judges in the regional courts&#13;
(second instance) and 116 judges employed by the Supreme Court. The vast majority of cases are&#13;
heard in the district and cit courts (first instance), with approximately I % of cases reaching the&#13;
regional and oblast (second instance) courts. Very few cases reach the Supreme Court, which&#13;
exercises some original jurisdiction as do the middle level (regional and oblast) courts.&#13;
The arbitrazh courts consist of much fewer courts and judges (their first instance courts are regional&#13;
and oblast courts): 82 courts in the first instance (a total of 89, one in each of the subjects of the&#13;
RF, are planned), 10 federal circuit courts in the second instance (with some original jurisdiction)&#13;
and the High Arbitrazh Court. There are a total of 1,774 judges of which 1,578 are at the trial&#13;
level, 143 in the circuit courts and 53 work in the High Arbitrazh Court.&#13;
In addition to judges, the district and city courts of general jurisdiction employ judicial enforcement&#13;
officers who work for both general jurisdiction and arbitrazh courts. These 9,500 enforcement&#13;
officers, are tasked with executing judgments of both court systems.&#13;

Organization and Conduct of Study&#13;
6.            The study will require the participation of several experts as set forth below under each&#13;
of the major topics to be addressed. These experts are to include persons familiar with the Russian legal&#13;
and judicial system. The team conducting the study ("Consultants") should include persons with&#13;
experience in the operation of court systems in the civil law and common law systems. The Consultants&#13;
will hire the necessary experts to perform the work and provide them with any logistic and administrative&#13;
support.&#13;
7.            As part of the methodology of the study, the Consultants will conduct surveys of judges,&#13;
selected counsel, court personnel and judicial administrators, and conduct first hand observation of the&#13;
conduct of the work of selected courts at each level of the system. The survey and observational work&#13;
will guide the analysis of both (A and B) parts of the study. Given the overall focus of the project and&#13;
considerations of practicality, the observational and analytical work will concentrate on first instance&#13;
courts in six different sites.  Because of their importance, the sites will include Moscow and St.&#13;
Petersburg. Other sites should include two oblast capitals in European Russia and in the central and far&#13;
east regions of Asian Russia. The exact sites would be chosen by the Consultants in consultation with&#13;
the RFLR (who will solicit views from the Council of Judges).&#13;
8.           The Consultants will prepare a workplan to be presented and agreed to by the RFLR&#13;
within four weeks of the effective date of the contract. The workplan will include a detailed schedule,&#13;
methodology, and output of the work to be conducted.&#13;
9.            The Consultants will conduct the work in close collaboration with the RFLR and assure&#13;
that the RFLR's guidance is observed by the persons who are conducting the work. There will be&#13;
periodic consultations between the RFLR and the person or persons of the Consultants who are&#13;
responsible for the conduct of the work. Findings and recommendations will be informally shared and&#13;
discussed with the RFLR. A formal mid-term review of progress will be conducted by the RFLR and&#13;
the Contraccor within 16 weeks of the beginning of the work.  A draft of the findings and&#13;
recommendations of the study will be provided by the Consultants to the RFLR for comment by the end&#13;
of the 24th week of work under the contract. In addition, preliminary results of the study will be shared&#13;
and discussed with the Council of Judges which will comment and critique Consultant's preliminary&#13;
findings and recommendations. The Council of Judges, in consultation with the RFLR, will decide on&#13;
the appropriate fora to discuss the preliminary findings, which may include judicial workshops financed&#13;
under the Project. The Consultants will submit their final report within 6 weeks of the receipt of the&#13;
comments from the RFLR.&#13;
10.          The following subparts set forth the aspects of the operation of the courts of general&#13;
jurisdiction which are to be the subject of the study. Each subpart indicates the topics to be covered, the&#13;
level of effort which is likely to be needed, and the qualifications of the persons to be used in the conduct&#13;
of the work.&#13;
A. Analysis of Court Administration Issues of the Courts of General Jurisdiction&#13;
11.          Objective and Scope of Services. The objective of this part of the study is to analyze&#13;
issues involved in administering CGJ, including budget analysis, personnel issues, and costs of providing&#13;
justice through the CGJ. The study will include recommendations concerning: (i) ways to rationalize&#13;
the flow of money in and out of the court system; reduce the costs while improving the performance of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

the court system; and for generating the resources for financing the operation of the justice system&#13;
without impeding access to justice; (ii) ways to improve the management of personnel; and (iii) was to&#13;
improve the administration of the CGJ system. The study will include a discussion of how best to&#13;
measure the impact on the efficiency and fairness of the justice system of carrying out the&#13;
recommendations.&#13;
12.            The areas for analysis under this part of the study will include:&#13;
*      budget overview and analysis (including information from the Ministry of Justice&#13;
(MOJ) concerning the budget of the general court system and, for comparative&#13;
purposes, information from the High Commercial Court concerning the budget&#13;
of that court system).&#13;
*      does the current system of administering the CGJ by local branches of the MOJ&#13;
in any way impede the: (i) independence of the judiciary; and (ii) efficient&#13;
functioning of the administration of justice; if so, how can the current system be&#13;
improved to provide a better dispute resolution source to the public3&#13;
*      personnel review  (number of personnel, their responsibilities, appointment,&#13;
promotion and dismissal policies for court personnel, skill requirements)&#13;
*      appointment and disciplining (suspension and removal) of judges&#13;
i      review of current procedures (including legislative requirements) for the creation,&#13;
merging and abolishing of courts and court districts and consider whether a&#13;
reform of this system is necessary give the size of the population and the&#13;
country; if yes, propose reform measures&#13;
e      desirability of the creation of a new level of judicial officer, such as a magistrate,&#13;
be authorized to hear specific categories of cases (the proponents of this step&#13;
assert that it would increase access to the courts, make hearings quicker and&#13;
cheaper and make the selection of the judicial personnel easier because&#13;
qualifications could be less academically demanding)&#13;
*      desirability of a less formally organized courts (such as justices of peace) at the&#13;
entrance level of the court system (in considering the question, the Consultants&#13;
will take into account the reforms which have been introduced in industrialized&#13;
countries to expedite the handling of cases and make the process more responsive&#13;
to the needs of the public)&#13;
*      desirability in the RF of a system of administrative courts (would a separate&#13;
administrative court system make possible a faster and more objective way of&#13;
handling the resolution of some 1.5 to 2 million cases concerning administrative&#13;
violations?)&#13;
I/     The purpose of this study is not to propose detailed structural changes in the judiciary in RF.&#13;

measures which should be taken to improve the situation, include changing the&#13;
security standards of the courthouses).&#13;

require the services of persons experienced in court administration and in analyzing the costs and&#13;
revenues of court systems in the industrialized countries and detailed knowledge of the operation and&#13;
administration of the courts in Russia. Member(s) of the Consultants team should be or have been&#13;
responsible for the fiscal operation of a major court system - either at the national level or in a major&#13;
region. It would be desirable that at least one of the experts have produced analytical work which has&#13;
been the basis for the introduction of significant reforms in the operation of a court system. Their time&#13;
will be divided into two phases - the first to organize the collection of the data, to discuss and agree on&#13;
the analytical approach to be taken and review the approach with the RFLR and the Council of Judges,&#13;
and the second, to carry out the analysis and the production of the report.&#13;
B. Analysis of Case-Flow Management and Process of Providing Justice through the CGJ&#13;
14.           Objective and Scope of Services. The objective of this part of the study is to analyze the&#13;
management of the case flow through CGJ. The study will result in proposals and recommendations&#13;
concerning ways in which management of the flow of cases through CGJ can be changed in order to&#13;
achieve a more efficient and effective justice system.  It will include a discussion of appropriate&#13;
performance targets and of how to measure the impact of carrying out the recommendations.&#13;
15.           The study will take into account the provisions of the Russian Constitution and the basic&#13;
legislation and regulations listed in footnote No. 2, page 1 above. It will also take into account the&#13;
regulations at the regional, oblast and city level which may govern the operation of the courts which are&#13;
used as objects of the study. The study will also use data collected from the judges, court personnel and&#13;
litigants and their lawyers in the courts included in the survey. These will be the same courts used in&#13;
the analysis of the costs of providing justice. (See subpart A above). The survey will include interviews&#13;
with the personnel involved as well as the direct observation by the team conducting the study of the&#13;
actual operation of the process.&#13;
16.           The study will analyze the various stages of the process (e.g. intake of the complaint,&#13;
registration of the case, gathering and recording of evidence in preparation for the hearing, the hearing&#13;
or "trial" and its recording, the reaching and expression of the decision, the choice of sanction and the&#13;
enforcement personnel.) The study will determine the two most frequent categories of cases (likely to&#13;
include debt collection) filed in CGJ and analyze the court procedures and case management flow on the&#13;
basis of these two types of cases.&#13;
17.           The study will also analyze the quality and availability of the support services to the&#13;
process of justice. This will include the personnel systems for judges and court personnel, the book-&#13;
keeping and other financial controls used by the courts, and record-keeping, filing, retrieval and archival&#13;
systems used for case management. Attention will be paid to the effectiveness of these services from the&#13;
point of view of the public as well as the personnel of the justice system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

18.          Questions which should be addressed include, but are not limited to, the following:&#13;
*     Is the current practice of having judges meet personally with prospective litigants&#13;
to go over their proposed filings a good use of the time of the judges? Is it&#13;
compatible with the role of the judge in making a final objective resolution of the&#13;
case, or could the initial review of the adequacy of the filing be performed by&#13;
court personnel?&#13;
*     How can the enforcement of court decisions be improved? Currently there are&#13;
9,500 judicial enforcement officers on the staffs of the district and city courts.&#13;
However, less than half of the judgments are executed. A draft "Law on a&#13;
Judicial Bailiffs Service" and a draft "Law on the Enforcement of Judgments"&#13;
has been prepared. Their provisions should be taken into account.&#13;
*     What is the current system of records management? What standards changes&#13;
should be proposed to make record management more appropriate, including&#13;
proposals on records management equipment, docket maintenance, records&#13;
retention schedules (to allow for the destruction of unnecessary records), and&#13;
procedures for purging files of inactive cases? How are cases currently archived?&#13;
In courts or the MOJ? Consideration should be given to making the archiving&#13;
system more efficient, perhaps on a regional basis.&#13;
3     In Russia, sizeable concerns exist about the accuracy of the records of judicial&#13;
proceedings. Presently, notes are taken in long hand by a secretary who has no&#13;
legal training. (In the commercial court system the notes are taken by the judge.)&#13;
There are many complaints of delays in the proceedings and inaccuracies in the&#13;
records. How could the current methodology of court reporting be improved so&#13;
that it is a reliable part of the official record ( What changes in the legislation&#13;
may be needed to make acceptable the use of sound or video records? What are&#13;
appropriate methods of maintaining records? Should all proceedings require a&#13;
verbatim record or should some require only a summary?)&#13;
i     What is the current usage of standardized legal forms? Is it adequate? Which&#13;
other standardized forms should be in use (which are the areas in which&#13;
standardized approaches are appropriate for all judges and courts)?&#13;
*     How can automation be best introduced (and improved) in courts in order to&#13;
enhance case management?&#13;
*     Review current system of producing and maintaining case statistics and make&#13;
recommendations for its improvement.&#13;
19.          The following issues should be addressed in the analysis of procedural items that impact&#13;
on the performnance of CGJ and the service they provide to the public:&#13;
*     How is the new system working which permits a judicial order to be issued&#13;
without the holding of a hearing in some cases? Should the use of this modality&#13;
be expanded?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix 1. Study on Court Administration and Case Management                             7&#13;
*     What is the current system of issuing default judgments?  How can it be&#13;
improved?&#13;
*     Should there be any modification to the current right of the parties to agree to&#13;
transfer original trial jurisdiction from the district to the kray and oblast courts?&#13;
*     Does the present system of providing expert opinion testimony work well? There&#13;
have been complaints that the judicial expert opinion centers in each oblast&#13;
(which are under the MOJ) do not perform adequately. How can the expert&#13;
opinion system be reformed to provide better service to the public?&#13;
20.          Level of Effort and Qualifications. As in the first part of the study, the work on this&#13;
part should include a team of Consultants experienced in case management and procedural issues in&#13;
industrialized countries, as well as detailed knowledge of the work of courts in Russia. The importance&#13;
of understanding why certain practices are followed or not followed will require an intimate knowledge&#13;
of the Russian conditions under which the justice system operates and the cultural assumptions which the&#13;
various participants in the justice system make in performing their roles.&#13;
21.           Taking into account the foregoing, the Consultants should plan to provide the services&#13;
of professionals with experience across the range of topics outlined above. As in the first part of the&#13;
study, the time of the experts will be divided into two phases - the first to organize the collection of the&#13;
data, to discuss and agree on the analytical approach to be taken and review the approach with RFLR and&#13;
the Council of Judges, and the second, to carry out the analysis and production of the report.&#13;

APPENDix K&#13;
GUIDELINES FOR THE ORGANIZATION OF WORKSHOPS FOR JUDGES&#13;
1.           International experience has demonstrated that the strongest resistance to reforming&#13;
judicial systems around the world comes from the judges themselves. There are a number of reasons for&#13;
that: first, perceived threat to their tenure; second, professional inertia; third, "rent-seeking" attitudes and&#13;
habits; and fourth, cultural traditions concerning the role of a judge. Reforns usually do not succeed&#13;
unless judges are involved in the process from the outset, feel that they own the reform process, and&#13;
provide vital insider information on the problems in the adjudication system.&#13;
The Workshop Concept&#13;
2.            A series of judicial workshops are proposed as a device to involve judges in the reform&#13;
process. These workshops are aimed at getting Russian judges to share their experiences and discuss&#13;
problems in camera. These are not training seminars, but interactive fora where judges themselves will&#13;
be working out solutions. The ultimate goals of the workshops are achieving consensus and leadership&#13;
building (which are both central to judicial reform). The workshops are designed to involve judges of&#13;
all three court systems (courts of general jurisdiction, arbitrazh courts and the Constitutional Court) and&#13;
from all three instances. They will be organized in close cooperation with the Council of Judges of the&#13;
RF which is the principal professional association of Russian judges of all different court systems. The&#13;
Council, currently headed by a member of the Supreme Court of the RF, is interested and involved in&#13;
issues of judicial reform in Russia.&#13;
Objectives of Workshops&#13;
3.           Immediate objectives of the workshops are:&#13;
a)     To gather information.  How  Russian judicial system  operates in practice (its&#13;
administrative structure, structure of specific courts, case management practices, budget&#13;
allocations and flows, costs of justice for the litigants and invisible costs to the society,&#13;
judicial training, legal procedures, ADR methods, and physical facilities and equipment),&#13;
can only be learned from the judges themselves.&#13;
b)     To identify problems and hear proposals and solutions. No one is better equipped than&#13;
judges to suggest realistic solutions to the problems they face every day. Usually they&#13;
will have a good feeling of what would and would not work in practice.&#13;
c)     To motivate the judges. Giving the judges, who are often poorly paid and feel&#13;
"forgotten" by their government, a voice in reform. This constitutes a great morale-&#13;
booster, and reinforces pride in their job and satisfaction with their position. Moreover&#13;
such workshops can begin to generate a sense of corporate identity, essential to the&#13;
development of the judiciary as the third branch of government as envisioned in the&#13;
Constitution of the Russian Federation.&#13;
d)     To identify potential leaders. Discussions during the workshops will reveal who&#13;
understands the nature of the necessary changes and possesses leadership qualities among&#13;
the judiciary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                                                         Technical Annex: Russia Legal Reform Project&#13;
f)     To encourage fraternity among judges. Informal setting will help the formation of&#13;
"esprit de corps" among the Russian judiciary, especially given the nature of the different&#13;
court systems in the RF.&#13;
Methodology&#13;
a)     Speakers or facilitators can be the same for all the workshops (or all the sessions). Ten&#13;
speakers are need for workshops; a maximum of three will be foreign judges/speakers.&#13;
Most of them should be judges or former judges. Prior to the first workshops, a meeting&#13;
of speakers will be held in order to explain the nature of the workshops, agree on written&#13;
contributions, and emphasize to them that these presentations are not about the law or&#13;
legal doctrines, but about the daily work of judges.&#13;
b)     Nature of the presentations. The role of the speakers is to introduce subjects for&#13;
reflection and discussion, to raise questions and problems, and to encourage and stimulate&#13;
debate and exchange of ideas among the participating judges. Presentations should not&#13;
last more than half an hour. They are not supposed to refer to the substance of law or&#13;
to legal doctrine, but rather to real life experiences.&#13;
c)     Participating judges. It is important that at least ten days before the workshops the&#13;
participants receive and have the opportunity to review the reading materials prepared&#13;
by the speakers. In workshops organized later, these materials should include reports&#13;
from  prior workshops.  The judges should be ready when they return to their&#13;
jurisdictions to share the experiences of the workshops in presentations, speeches,&#13;
lectures, articles, and papers.&#13;
d)     Duration of the workshops. The workshops will take three days for each participating&#13;
judge. Three sets of workshops (each lasting three days) will take place during the same&#13;
week, staggered by a day.&#13;
e)     Venue.  The workshops should be held in a resort outside of a large city in order to&#13;
create a collegial atmosphere and give the judges an opportunity to interact with one&#13;
another.&#13;
f)     Evaluation and Reports. At the end of each workshop, participating judges will make&#13;
anonymous evaluations of the program, the speakers, the reading materials, the&#13;
discussions, the organization, and the conclusions. These evaluations, together with the&#13;
records of the workshop proceedings will be factored into the preparation of a final report&#13;
of each of the workshops. Conclusions and recommendations of the workshops will be&#13;
distributed, in consultation with the Council of Judges and the RFLR, to the judiciary.&#13;
This distribution can be in the form of a newsletter of the Council of Judges. Also,&#13;
judges participating in later organized workshops should familiarize themselves with&#13;
reports from prior workshops.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Appendix K. Guidelines for the Organization of Workshops for Judges                          3&#13;
Tentative Issues for Discussion&#13;
a)     Social role of the judge in a transition economy. The administration of justice is a&#13;
service provided by the state to society to solve conflicts rather than merely to interpret&#13;
laws. The objective is to serve citizens and economic actors in society.&#13;
b)     Judicial reasoning and exercise ofjudicial discretion. Judges may not be making use of&#13;
all the authority the law gives to them. Different methods of interpretation, legal&#13;
classification and analogies, exercise of discretion could all be used to the benefit of a&#13;
society in transition.&#13;
c)     Improvements in court administration and case management.  The RFLR will be&#13;
commissioning a study on improvements in court administration and case management&#13;
as part of the project. A preliminary version of this report should be presented and&#13;
discussed at a workshop.&#13;
d)     Organization of the work of a judge. Talking to lawyers and parties to a case, examining&#13;
evidence, sitting in hearings, writing decisions, handling backlog. How to use time more&#13;
efficiently.&#13;
e)     The role of the judge in civil and commercial proceedings. Filing of complaints,&#13;
evaluating written pleadings, listening to oral arguments, writing decisions, dealing with&#13;
appeals.&#13;
f)     Training of judges (what judges really need to learn according to their experiences in the&#13;
field) and the benefits and drawbacks of specialization ofjudges on specific areas of law.&#13;
g)    Independence of judges. Real life problems of relations with government authorities,&#13;
legislators and the press.&#13;
h)     Ethical aspects of judges' work. Ex parte communications, conflicts of interest, etc.&#13;
i)     Security of judges.&#13;
Organization of the Workshops&#13;
4.            A general coordinator should be hired to organize all aspects of the workshop. The&#13;
general coordinator will hire the necessary personnel to carry out this task.&#13;
5.            Costs include travel for the participating judges, speakers and staff; lodging and meals;&#13;
administrative expenses.&#13;
Qualifications and Tasks for a Coordinator&#13;
6.            Personal qualifications: Preferably, the person should be an educator with administrative&#13;
experience in the education sector, with some knowledge of teaching techniques and resources. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                                            Technical Annex: Russia Legal Reform Project&#13;
person should have knowledge and experience in organization of courses. Being a lawyer is not a&#13;
requirement, though a legal educator with a knowledge of administration would be a plus.&#13;
7.             Duties of the General Coordinator:  To exercise the general supervision of the&#13;
organization, preparation, development and evaluation of each workshop by the staff under his or her&#13;
orders. Specifically, overseeing: (i) designation of each of the speakers or facilitators; the coordination&#13;
with them for the preparation of the reading materials for the judges, the printing of those materials and&#13;
their distribution to the judges at least ten days before a workshop; (ii) coordination with the Council of&#13;
Judges and the RFLR in selecting judges who will attend each workshop; (iii) coordination of the&#13;
necessary travel arrangements for all of those attending; (iv) the selection of the place where each&#13;
workshop is going to take place; (v) coordination about the dates of the event(s); (vi) coordination of&#13;
accommodation, meals, distribution of list of attendants and participants, pencils, papers, water and&#13;
services during the meetings and sessions, medical emergencies, communications, etc.; (vii) coordination&#13;
of all activities during each workshop necessary for the success of the event(s); (viii) coordination of the&#13;
preparation, distribution, collection and processing of the conclusions and recommendations of the&#13;
workshop(s), as well as of the evaluations of each workshop; preparation of a final report on each&#13;
workshop; and (ix) coordination of the hiring of the necessary staff to perform those duties mentioned&#13;
above.&#13;
&#13;

OTHER HIGH PRIORITY LEGAL REFORM ACTIVITIES&#13;
1.           To qualify for financing under this category, subprojects will have to be approved by the&#13;
Bank. Preference will be given to subprojects that meet the objectives of one of the defined project&#13;
components. The information that will need to accompany requests for Bank financing under the other&#13;
high-priority activities component (Part E) of the Project will, inter alia, have to contain: (i) detailed&#13;
description of the proposed activity (subproject), together with a proposed implementation schedule; (ii)&#13;
identification of the implementation agency for the activity; (iii) description of the level of requested&#13;
(proposed) financing from the Bank (including an estimate of the foreign versus local expenditures&#13;
breakdown of the costs), together with an estimated disbursement schedule; (iv) description of the&#13;
proposed selection procedures (including terms of reference, qualifications and duration of service) for&#13;
any consultant to be engaged or for any goods to be procured for the purposes of the subproject; (v)&#13;
determination of the level of counterpart contribution for the subproject.&#13;
2.            The following is a non-exhaustive tentative list of activities that, if further developed, can&#13;
be financed under other high-priority activities component (Part E) of the Project following an agreement&#13;
between the Borrower and the Bank:&#13;
(i)    Testing in courts, on a pilot basis, the introduction of measures designed to improve&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The overall objective of the Legal
            Reform Project is to improve the performance of the Russian
            legal system in areas key to the effective functioning of
            market institutions. Specific objectives are to: 1) improve
            the quality of drafting of economic laws, decrees and
            regulations; 2) assist the government of Russia in designing
            the appropriate classification of legislation (including in
            electronic format) and in identifying the appropriate
            methods of codifying Russian legislation; 3) begin to
            introduce innovative teaching methods and materials in the
            legal education system, with particular emphasis on
            increased exchange between legal academia and practice and
            to improve teacher training; and 4) improve the quality of
            judicial training for courts of general jurisdiction and
            arbitrage courts. The project will comprise four
            inter-related components consisting of technical assistance
            to support: 1) legal drafting; 2) collection and
            dissemination of legal information; 3) legal education,
            including public education campaigns; and 4) judicial
            reform, including support for alternative dispute resolution.
