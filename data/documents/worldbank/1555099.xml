POLICIES FOR EFFICIENT AND EQUITABLE&#13;
GROWTH OF CITIES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES&#13;
A Background Study for World Development Report, 1979&#13;
The unprecederLted rate of urban growth in developing nations has created&#13;
massive new tasks for national and local policy makers. This paper, which&#13;
was prepared as a background paper for World Development Report, 1979, attempts&#13;
to delineate the major policy issues which arise in the efforts to adapt to&#13;
the growth of cities in developing countries, aid it discusses policies&#13;
designed to increase the efficiency and equity of urban development.&#13;
Particular areas covered by this paper include urban employment, income&#13;
redistribution through the fiscal system, transportation, housing, and social&#13;
services (i.e., education, health, and related services). The policy instru-&#13;
ments which are considered incltade public investment, pricing, taxation, and&#13;
regulation.  Throughout, it is emphasized that many of these policy instruments&#13;
can be used in ways that improve both the efficiency and the equity of the&#13;
development of cities, without a conflict between these goals. The paper does&#13;
not attempt to address in a comprehensive manner the issues of overall national&#13;
spatial policy, nor those relating to the administration and finances of urban&#13;
government, since these are extensively treated in other forthcoming World&#13;
Bank publications.&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION: A READER'S GUIDE&#13;
A. The Setting and Purpose of the Paper&#13;
In 1950 approximately 20 percent of the population in developing&#13;
countries lived in urban areas. In 1975, this proportion had reached an&#13;
estimated 31 percent. By the year 2000 some 45 percent of the people in&#13;
developing countries (LDCs) will live in cities and towns.-/ This rapid&#13;
urbanization process has been accompanied by the explosive growth of the large&#13;
cities. For example, in the mid-1970s Mexico City and Sao Paulo each grew&#13;
by over half a million people annually, while such cities such as Jakarta&#13;
and Seoul grew by over a quarter of a million people each year.-/   Small&#13;
and medium-size cities are also growing rapidly, in some countries in fact&#13;
more rapidly than the largest cities, but it is in the largest cities that&#13;
the difficulties of adjusting to rapid growth and large size tend to&#13;
become most visible.&#13;
By their very size, such metropoles as Mexico City, whose&#13;
population exceeded 10 million in 1975, and Buenos Aires, Sao Paulo,&#13;
Rio de Janeiro, Cairo, Seoul, Jakarta, Calcutta and Bombay, each with&#13;
populations well in excess of five million, are in the same league as the&#13;
medium-size and large developing countries as far as their populations&#13;
are concerned.-/ In terms of income and production, these large cities&#13;
1/ See World Bank (1979), Chapter 6.&#13;
2/ Based on unpublished city population estimates and projections of the&#13;
United Nations Population Division.&#13;
3/ In 1976, 35 of 92 developing countries had less than 5 million inhabitants,&#13;
and 54 had less than 10 million inhabitants (World Development Indicators&#13;
1978, Table 1, Annex to World Bank, 1978k).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
are even more important than indicated by their populations, considering&#13;
the high concentration of economic activity in urban areas.   For example,&#13;
In 1973 the city of Bogota accounted for some 12 percent of the&#13;
population of Colombia, but contributed approximately 20 percent of&#13;
the country's GNP (Linn, 1978a). For South Asia, it has been observed&#13;
that "the GNP of any large Indian city-region is, after all, as great&#13;
as that of Sri Lanka or Nepal." (Waide, 1978, p. 13)&#13;
Because of their sheer size in terms of population and&#13;
economic activity, the large cities in LDCs deserve the attention of&#13;
politicians, planners and economists. The efficiency with which the&#13;
cities and towns in LDCs allocate their resources will increasingly&#13;
determine the overall performance of these economies, particularly in&#13;
the middle income countries such as Argentina, Mexico, Colombia, Brazil.,&#13;
Algeria, Egypt and Korea, where some two-thirds or more of the national&#13;
population are expected to live in urban areas by the year 2000&#13;
(Beier et al., 1975). What is more, while the incidence of poverty&#13;
in developing countries is higher in rural than in urban areas,-/ the&#13;
absolute rnumbers of the poor living in cities and towns are large. In&#13;
Manila, for example, 1.5 million people were classified as living in absolute&#13;
poverty in the early 1970s (World Bank, 1975c); in Brazil, some 600,000&#13;
people currently live below the poverty threshold in Rio de Janeiro and&#13;
Sao Paulo and some 1.7 million people in the remaining urban areas (Webb&#13;
and Pfeffermann, 1978). For moral and political reasons, a policy of&#13;
general poverty alleviation must come to grips with the poverty&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
problem in urban areas, where poverty is particularly visible and&#13;
troublesome due to its spatial concentration.&#13;
This paper assumes that urbanization will continue at a rapid&#13;
pace in LDCs for the foreseeable future. Even if it were desirable and&#13;
feasible to slow down this process of transformation, urbanization and&#13;
the growth of large cities will continue into the future under all&#13;
but the most extreme and unlikely policy scenarios.-/    It therefoie&#13;
becomes increasingly important to search for policies which improve&#13;
the efficiency of resource allocation in urban areas and alleviate urban&#13;
poverty.&#13;
The purpose of the present paper is to contribute to this search&#13;
by taking a comprehensive look at the state of the art of economic&#13;
analysis of urban problems and policies in LDCs.     Such an overview&#13;
must cover a large range of issues including employment, housing, public&#13;
serv.ces, and fiscal policy, and the paper had to go to some length&#13;
to do justice to these issues. In order to make the task manageable&#13;
a number of restrictions were placed on the scope of the paper: First,&#13;
the paper emphasizes the policies for the efficiency and equity in the&#13;
growth of cities, thus largely neglecting rural-urban linkages as well as&#13;
purely rural issues.2/   Second, the paper focuses to a significant extent&#13;
on policies which can be taken at the city or project level, rather than&#13;

public administration, management and planning. The remainder of this&#13;
introductory chapter serves as a reader's guide by presenting the outline&#13;
of the paper and reviewing its major findings with an indication where&#13;
these are located in the subsequent chapters.&#13;

B. Outline and Major Policy Implications of the Paper&#13;
1. Diagnosis and Dimensions of the Urban Policy Problem&#13;
Chapter II begins with a summary diagnosis of the urban policy&#13;
problem in LDCs (pp. 15-2?),    In a nutshell, it is (a) that urban labor&#13;
supply tends to expand more rapidly than urban labor demand, thus&#13;
limiting urban employment opportunities, and depressing wages and&#13;
incomes, especially for unskilled workers; and (b) that the demand for&#13;
urban services, including transportation, housing and public services,&#13;
expands more rapidly than their supply, thus leading to rising prices&#13;
for urban land and housing, overcrowded housing and shortages of public&#13;
services, all of which hit the urban poor especially hard. Since these&#13;
imbalances result in large part from inefficient labor demand and service&#13;
supply management by governments, the efficiency and equity of urban&#13;
development can be improved by eliminating the inefficient policies&#13;
holding down labor demand and service supply. Improved policies&#13;
regarding urban labor supply and service demand conditions can further&#13;
contribute to rectify these imbalances.&#13;
Chapter II goes on to review some comparative statistics&#13;
reflecting the major dimensions of the urban development problem in LDCs&#13;
(pp. 24-28), alboltt with some misgivings regarding their comparability&#13;
across countries or usefulness for urban policy design and implemenIzatUcv&#13;
(pp. 22-24).&#13;
The annex to this chapter presents a simple and very general&#13;
conceptual framework which allows one to show how urban employment policy,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6-&#13;
fiscal policy, and the public management of the demand for and the supply&#13;
of urban services interact in determining the efficiency and equity of&#13;
urban development (pp. 52-55).  This framework permits one to relate&#13;
to each other the rat'- r diverging concerns of the subsequent chapters.&#13;
2. Employment and the Urban Poor&#13;
Chapter III begins by drawing an employment profile of the&#13;
urban poor which casts some doubts on the common notion that the poor are&#13;
primarily unemployed, or employed in marginal or "informal" sector&#13;
activities, untouched by government intervention (pp. 57-69).  The&#13;
paper ther, presents a summary overview of how the urban poor are affected&#13;
by policies acting on the demand for and supply of urban labor and by&#13;
labor market imperfections caused by public intervention (pp. 70-107).&#13;
The paper concludes with a list of policy suggestions in a number of&#13;
aeeas relevant for the employment of the urban poor, including public&#13;
administration, regulation and taxation, public service investment and&#13;
pricing, social service provision, support of small scale enterprises,&#13;
the urban land market, and migration (pp. 108-114).&#13;
3. Redistribution of Income Through the Fiscal System&#13;
Since increased employment and earnings very probably can eliminate&#13;
urban poverty only in the long term, Chapter IV addresses the question&#13;
whether redistribution of income through fiscal policy holds out hope&#13;
for quick relief. A review of budget incidence studies concludes that&#13;
taxation and public spending do not provide much scope for significantly&#13;
reducing the inequalities in the income distribution found in most LDCs&#13;
(pp.  116-122).    However, the chapter goes on to consider how fiscal&#13;
policy could be designed to alleviate poverty in LDCs, and in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
particular urban poverty (pp. 123-146). Since the urban poor tend to pay&#13;
about ten percent of their incomes in taxes, the reduction of taxes&#13;
bearing on the poor (mainly indirect taxes, in particular sumptuary taxes&#13;
and local excise taxes) should be contemplated (pp, 124-130). To the extent&#13;
that increased public revenues have to be raised, reliance on EgE    sive&#13;
taxes, such as urban property taxation, automotive taxes, and various types&#13;
of benefit taxes would be desirable (pp. 130-141).&#13;
Although improved tax policies would be helpful, the main scope&#13;
for urban poverty alleviation through the fiscal system lies with public&#13;
expenditures. Chapter IV therefore briefly considers the extent to which&#13;
budgets need to be shifted in favor of the poor (pp. 141-144), but goes&#13;
on to point out that careful sectoral policy analysis, design and imple-&#13;
mentation are required to ensure that public expenditures which are made&#13;
ostensibly on behalf of the poor actually reach them, in the sense of&#13;
increasing the welfare of as many of the poor as possible (pp. 145-146).&#13;
The subsequent chapters deal explicitly with this question.&#13;
4. Urban Transportation&#13;
Chapter V begins by reflecting on the role of urban transportation&#13;
in providing the link between residence, employment and amenities, as well&#13;
as between consumers and producers in urban areas (pp. 147-151). It then&#13;
summarizes the available evidence on the determinants of urban transport&#13;
demand and supply in LDCs (pp. 151-168), which suggests that transport&#13;
demand and costs will vary directly with city size, making the correct&#13;
design of urban transport systems and of urban land use more important&#13;
as cities become very large.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
The main transport policies appropriate for large cities in LDCs&#13;
(pp. 168-175) will include support for walking and bicycling complemented&#13;
by improved bus services in the low-income countries, and a&#13;
relatively heavier reliance on bus services and other intermediate&#13;
motorized transport modes (e.g., jitneys) in the middle income countries.&#13;
Investment strategies favoring rapid mass transit (e.g., subways) and&#13;
the private automobile are not likely to be in the interest of efficient&#13;
urban transport systems in any LDCs, while curbs on the use of the private&#13;
automobile in congested central cities will increase transport efficiency.&#13;
The chapter goes on to show that the very same set of policies&#13;
also results in a transport system which better serves the needs of the&#13;
urban poor (pp.178-184), and concludes by contrasting conventional urban&#13;
transport policies with those desirable on efficiency and equity grounds,&#13;
in particular in the areas of transport investment, pricing and regulation&#13;
(pp. 184-199).&#13;
5. Urban Housing: Land, Services, and Shelter&#13;
Chapter VI starts with the definition of housing as including&#13;
the shelter structure, the lot on which the structure stands, and the&#13;
infrastructure services provided to the lot, and it demonstrates the&#13;
importance of housing in the expenditures of urban households, in the&#13;
economy of LDCs, and in their cities (pp. 199-207).&#13;
The chapter then reviews the major aspects of housing demand&#13;
and supply. For housing demand it shows(a) the importance and&#13;
variation of private preferences for the major housing attributes&#13;
(access, space, tenure, services, and shelter structure) (pp. 208-213),&#13;
and (b) the impact of population and income growth on the growth of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
urban housing demand over time (pp. 213-214). For urban housing supply,&#13;
the chapter discusses (a) the different roles played by various sup-.7-&#13;
agents, in particular the role of public agencies in urban service&#13;
provision, and the role of the private sector in providing raw land and&#13;
shelter structures (pp. 215-220); and (b) various factors limiting increasu.&#13;
in the housing supply, especially public policies restricting land&#13;
conversion, public service provision, and shelter construction (pp. 220-223)&#13;
The urban housing problem, whose symptoms include land invasion&#13;
and illegal subdivision, overcrowding, lack of basic services, poor&#13;
access to employment opportunities, and rapidly rising land and housing&#13;
prices, can be seen to be the inevitable resu.lt of a rapid.increase&#13;
in the demand for housing putting a heavy strain on an inelastic housing&#13;
supply (pp. 224-225). Since the failure of supply to adjust more quickly&#13;
to demand changes is in part due to inefficient public policies, and&#13;
since the poor are especially hurt by these maladjustments, a more&#13;
appropriate urban housing policy can contribute to greater efficiency&#13;
and equity (pp. 225-231).&#13;
On the basis of this diagnosis of the urban housing problem,&#13;
the chapter proceeds to develop a strategy for providing improved housing&#13;
for the poor. It begins by reporting on an estimate of housing needs&#13;
and the implied resource requirements at a global level, using a "basic&#13;
needs" approach (pp. 231-239); but since such housing needs estimates have&#13;
to be translated into specific policy prescriptions the remainder of the&#13;
chapter focuses mostly on a discussion of public policies designed to&#13;
lower the cost and increase the supply of housing for the poor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
In terms of direct public supply of housing services, it is&#13;
concluded that urban governments (a) can play only a limited role in urban&#13;
land acquisition in most countries (pp. 240-247); (b) must play a major&#13;
role in public service provision, using low-cost technologies&#13;
much more extensively than conventionally done in LDCs,&#13;
especially for water supply, sanitary and solid waste disposal, and&#13;
neighborhood road construction (pp. 247-257); (c) should not get directly&#13;
involved in shelter construction in most cities in LDCs because the&#13;
private sector is relatively efficient in this area, and public sector&#13;
intervention has generally not been successful (pp. 257-262).-V&#13;
As regards property taxation, it is concluded that property&#13;
taxes are not likely to have a significant direct impact on&#13;
urban housing supply, but that one should avoid high taxes on buildings,&#13;
eliminate taxes on property transfers, use special taxes on vacant land&#13;
with caution, and view proposals for land value increment taxatic.n with&#13;
some suspicion (pp. 263-267).&#13;
User charges have a major role to play in encouraging an&#13;
efficient allocation of demand and efficient investment patterns for&#13;
urban public services (pp. 267-275). In general, estimates of the marginal&#13;
cost of service provision can offer a rough guide to efficient service&#13;
pricing, but the cost of administration will limit the fine-tuning&#13;
in the pricing structure, particularly in the case of small consumers&#13;
(pp. 273-274). General subsidies for urban public services should be&#13;
avoided-because of their likely undesirable effects on efficiency, revenues,&#13;
1/ The exceptional experiences with public housing in Singapore and&#13;
Hong Kong are reviewed and shown to be only of limited relevance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and equity (pp.275278). Selective subsidies can be defended on grounds&#13;
of externalities or poverty alleviation (pp.278-285). For the case of&#13;
water supply careful consideration must be given to the appropriafe&#13;
vehicle of reaching the most deserving households: subsidization of&#13;
house connections is likely to be feasible and desirable in ml.ddle-income&#13;
countries, while subsidization of standposts will be preferable in the&#13;
low-income countries (pp. 279-284)..&#13;
Regulation and control of urban housing in LDCs have in general&#13;
done more harm than good. Regulations regarding urban land use, subdivision,&#13;
and building standards are observed mainly in the breach, but nevertheless&#13;
can result in clouded land titles, bull-dozing of slums, and elevated&#13;
standards for public housing programs (pp. 286-289). Rent controls are&#13;
counterproductive to their goal of lowering rents since they tend to&#13;
restrict the houtsing supply, impede mobility, reduce access to housing&#13;
by the poor, and limit property tax revenues (pp. 289-290).&#13;
The clhapter concludes with a tentative review of World Bank&#13;
experience with urban development projects in terms of their poverty&#13;
impact, affordability and replicability. A comparison of conventional&#13;
housing programs and World Bank projects shows that the latter are&#13;
designed to reach much lower in the income distribution, tend to avoid&#13;
subsidization more successfully, and are likely to be more replicable&#13;
in the sense of reaching a much larger number of urban poor&#13;
(pp.292-297). A review of estimated economic rates of return indicates&#13;
that these projects do not only serve the goal of poverty alleviation,&#13;
but also the goal of efficiency, in the sense of showing rates of return&#13;
greater than the opportunity cost of capital (pp. 302-304). The main&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
explanation for this good performance lies in low-cost service&#13;
standards that are adopted in World Bank projects (pp. 297-299).&#13;
However, a number of limitations on replicability remain even for&#13;
World Bank projects, particularly as regards urban land availability&#13;
and tenure regularization, the overall housing strategy in a country,&#13;
and the availability of general public revenues to support non-shelter&#13;
components of the urban projects (pp. 299-301).&#13;
6. Social Services: Education, Health, Nutrition, and Family Planning&#13;
Chapter VII starts with a description of the complex systems&#13;
relationships between education, health, nutrition, and family planning&#13;
and emphasizes the important role of women, infants, and children in&#13;
this context (pp.306-312). The main problem for the poor is that they&#13;
are trapped in a vicious circle where low incomes induce poor education,&#13;
health, nutrition and family planning, which interact among and reinforce&#13;
each other, thus leading in turn to low productivity and poverty.&#13;
As regards educati-on, it is concluded that its efficiency&#13;
could be improved by (a) a greater emphasis on public primary (or&#13;
basic) education, as compared with higher education; (b) possibly a&#13;
more aggressive use of school fees, and (c) a restructured curriculum&#13;
to provide more functional training (pp.315-320).    Very similar sets&#13;
of measures would also be in the interest of the urban poor, but&#13;
special emphasis needs to be placed on reducing the private cost of&#13;
education to them (e.g., out-of-pocket expenses) and on increasing the&#13;
physical accessibility of schools (pp. 320-325).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
Health and nutrition problems are particularly serious among&#13;
the urban poor, even when compared with rural dwellers and it is not&#13;
clear that public health systems always serve the urban poor better&#13;
than the rural poor (pp. 325-331). In attempting to deal with the urban&#13;
health and nutrition problem, the conventional policy bias in favor of&#13;
modern curative health care needs to be replaced by a focus on preventive,&#13;
or basic health care. This will serve to increase the efficiency and&#13;
equity of the health care system (pp. 331-335).&#13;
7. Conclusion&#13;
The final chapter very briefly summarizes the main messages of&#13;
this paper and points to some of the areas of urban policy in developing&#13;
countries which were not covered, but need to be given careful consideration:&#13;
the role of urban policy planning in the overall national policy framework,&#13;
and the importance of administrative and fiscal institutions which are&#13;
needed to implement good urban policy, once its ingredients are defined.&#13;

II. DIAGNOSIS AND DIMENSIONS OF THE URBAN POLICY PROBLEMS&#13;
Urbanization is progressing rapidly in most developing countries,&#13;
and the largest cities in LDCs are quickly growing to a size beyond that&#13;
experienced even in the industrialized countries. The change in the&#13;
balance between rural and urban sectors and the growth of large cities is&#13;
likely to continue in most LDCs for the foreseeable future, even where explicit&#13;
efforts are made to slow down this process (Renaud, 1979). The main reason&#13;
for this prediction is that urbanization and city growth are an integral&#13;
part of a more general process of transition in LDCs, which includes the&#13;
changing balance between the agricultural and the industrial and commercial&#13;
sectors, as well as rapid changes in cultural, social, and political con-&#13;
ditions in most developing countries. In this general process of transition,&#13;
the speed of which in many countries exceeds anything experienced previously,&#13;
maladjustments and frictions occur and adversely affect the efficiency as&#13;
well as equity of the outcome. The urbanization process is no exception&#13;
in this regard. This chapter presents a summary diagnosis of the transition&#13;
problems and of alternative policy approaches for cities of developing&#13;
countries, and presents an overview of the dimensions of urban transition&#13;
problems in the areas of employment and incomes, transportation, housing,&#13;
and social services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

A. Diagnosis of the Urban.Problems and Policy Approaches&#13;
Urban development problems differ across countries and across&#13;
cities within countries. Some common elements may nevertheless be found&#13;
in attempting to provide a diagnosis of the evident difficulties which occur&#13;
as cities grow rapidly throughout the developing world. In attempting such&#13;
a diagnosis of what constitutes the "'urban problem" in LDCs it is important&#13;
that one first defines the objectives according to which the prevailing urban&#13;
trends are evaluated.&#13;
One fairly common objective found among those in charge of designing&#13;
urban policies in developing countries is the goal to make cities serve more&#13;
effectively the preferences of the better-off sections of the urban population,&#13;
who tend to view the growing slums as an infringement on the beauty of&#13;
their city; who regard street vendors, pedestrians, and over-crowded&#13;
buses as a nuisance impeding the mobility of private automobiles; and who&#13;
perceive educational and health care needs in terms of unmet requirements&#13;
of more advanced facilities for higher education and curative medicine.&#13;
The policy prescriptions which tend to flow from this diagnosis of the&#13;
- 1/&#13;
problem include the "beautification" of cities through slum removal,&#13;
high-cost public housing projects, and banning of street vendors from&#13;
centrally located public places; the construction of limited-access high-&#13;
ways and of high-cost rapid transit facilities, especially subways, whi.le&#13;
banning slower, traditional transport modes from major streets, but not&#13;
limiting the use of private cars on congested streets; and the expansion&#13;
of subsidized universities and modern city hospitals. While this scenario&#13;
1/   This term was actually used in Khartoum (International Labor Office,&#13;
1976).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
may sound like a caricature, it is not far from the conventional urban&#13;
1/&#13;
policy approach in many cities of developing countries.&#13;
An alternative set of objectives calls for an increase in the&#13;
overall efficiency of urban growth, and for the alleviation of poverty&#13;
which affects substantial portions of the population in the cities of&#13;
developing countries. With these objectives in mind, one would begin by&#13;
analyzing the urban transition process as consisting in the interaction&#13;
between forces of demand and supply for goods and services in&#13;
cities, in particular for transportation, housing and public services,&#13;
and for the services of labor, capital, and land. The diagnosis of the&#13;
urban problem would then include, for instance, the observation that&#13;
the demand for unskilled labor is not expanding quickly enough to provide&#13;
employment at rising wages to a rapidly increasing labor force, while the&#13;
demands for land, capital, transportation, housing and public services are&#13;
expanding more rapidly than their supplies, resulting in increased prices,&#13;
bottlenecks or shortages for factors of production and services. Policy&#13;
analysis would therefore focus on the question of how the demand for labor,&#13;
and in particular, for unskilled labor, can be increased relative to the&#13;
growth in labor supply; and how the demands for scarce urban land, housing,&#13;
and services can be contained efficiently and equitably, while at the same&#13;
time attempting to e,xpand supplies more rapidly, especially for the urban&#13;
poor who are most disadvantaged in their access to available supplies of&#13;
urban amenities.&#13;
1/ A review of World Bank sector papers dealing *ith urban housing, urban&#13;
transport, education and health shows that the picture drawn in the&#13;
text is in fact accurate (World Bank, 1974a, 1975a, 1975b, 1975c).&#13;
The subsequent chapters will further substantiate this claim.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
The policy instruments used in implementing this second strategy&#13;
would include trade, fiscal and capital market policies designed to augment&#13;
the demand for unskilled urban labor and the elimination of impediments&#13;
on the functioning of the urban labor market, while attempting to curb the&#13;
growth in the urban labor supply through family planning programs and&#13;
policies encouraging accelerated rural development. They would also include&#13;
the elimination of subsidies for urban public services, which tend to lead&#13;
to excessive demands for urban road space by automobile users, for high-cost&#13;
public housing and infrastructure, and for higher education and modern&#13;
.urative health care. At the same time, the focus of public involvement&#13;
in supplying transport, housing and services would have to shift to those&#13;
area, where private supply responses are least able to meet the increases&#13;
in demands associated with rapid urban growth, e.g., low-cost urban&#13;
infrastructure, and basic education and health programs. Moreover, the&#13;
existing array of public regulations, controls, and tax instruments, which&#13;
frequently inhibit private and public supply responses, would have to be&#13;
amended to minimize these interferences.&#13;
These primary policy concerns are dealt with in the subsequent&#13;
chapters as follows:    Chapter III will discuss ways to raise the disposable&#13;
incomes of the poor through increased employment and productivity. Another&#13;
way of achieving the same goal is to reduce taxes paid by the poor or make&#13;
income transfers to them through the fiscal system. The scope for this&#13;
approach to poverty alleviation is discussed in Chapter IV. The remaining&#13;
chapters deal with investment, pricing, and regulatory policies for&#13;
specific urban goods and services, in particular transportation, housing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
and social services. Each of these chapters addresses essentially the&#13;
following set of questions:l&#13;
First, how can public investment policy be designed to reduce&#13;
costs to the poor consumer, and how can the benefits derived from public&#13;
intervention be increased and shared among as many of the poor as possible?&#13;
These benefits do not need to result from any subsidies and are not&#13;
necessarily associated with efficiency losses; on the contrary, efficiency&#13;
is increased when public intervention lowers costs by eliminnating monopoly&#13;
rents, or by reaping economies of scale. These benefits of public inter-&#13;
vention are referr('d to as "fiscal dividends" by some public finance&#13;
economists (Mclure, 1975).-/ The realization of fiscal dividends for the&#13;
poor requires (a) a conscious attempt to reduce costs and standards;&#13;
(b) substantial capital ot-tlays in service provision, particularly where&#13;
investments are lumpy, as is the case with many urban services; and&#13;
(c) the redirection of public investment expenditures and their fiscal&#13;
dividends from the rich to the poor,-/ as well as efforts to increase&#13;
1/ See the Annex to this Chapter for a simple diagrammatic exposition of the&#13;
issues and questions addressed in the subsequent paragraphs.&#13;
2/  The existence of such a fiscal dividend is, however, not always ensured&#13;
as a result of public intervention, The chapters below will cite examples&#13;
where the private sector appears to be more efficient in service provision&#13;
as long as it is not inhibited by public inlerference, as for instance in&#13;
the case of bus service, housing construction, and even garbage disposal.&#13;
3/ Examples cited below include investment in primary education rather than&#13;
university training, and in low cost rather than high-standard water and sewage&#13;
systems; road investments supporting pedestrian, bicycle and bus traffic,&#13;
rather than those geared mainly to private automobile traffic; investment&#13;
in slum improvement programs, rather than public housing benefitting high&#13;
and middle income groups. There is, however, a question to what extent&#13;
the fiscal dividend generated by such investments for the poor actually&#13;
stays with the poor. To the extent that they are site or location-specific&#13;
they may in part lead to land price and rent increases, and thus, in the&#13;
case of rental tenure of the poor, some of the fiscal dividend may be&#13;
passed on to the land owners. On the other hand, additions to the&#13;
stock of serviced land will also lower the land value and rents on&#13;
existing properties so that some of the benefits are passed on to other&#13;
renters. These questions are further discussed below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19&#13;
the overall availability of public resources through improved public&#13;
pricing and taxation. The last point raises the possibility&#13;
of a conflict between a rich and poor beneficiaries of public programs.&#13;
This conflict is, however, minimized to the extent that public investments&#13;
for the poor can also be justified on grounds of externalities, including&#13;
the "basic needs" externalities enjoyed by the wealthier segments of the&#13;
population.&#13;
Second, how should service prices be designed to (a) increase&#13;
the efficiency of resources by preventing excessive demand for public&#13;
services, i.e. allocate demand such that the social benefit from&#13;
an additional unit consumed equals the cost to the economy of producing this&#13;
extra unit; this requires especially the identification of subsidies that cannot&#13;
be defended on grounds of externalities or poverty alleviation; (b) increase&#13;
the revenues available for maintaining and expanding urban services to the&#13;
poor; and (c) raise the incomes of the poor by selective subsidies, which&#13;
may  either be justified on grounds of economic externalities or of "basic&#13;
needs" externalities? 11 These three goals may at times involve trade-offs,&#13;
particularly where subsidies for general poverty alleviation are concerned,&#13;
since they are likely to conflict with the efficiency and revenue goals.&#13;
1/ This last point raises the question to what extent "basic needs" externa-&#13;
lities fully reflect the distributional objective of public policy. It is&#13;
possible, at. least conceptually that; iA'addition to basic needs externa-&#13;
lities, the policy maker may al,so be interested in general poverty alleviation,&#13;
i.e. raising the disposable incomes of the poor quite irrespective of how&#13;
those incomes are spent. This subtle difference in the distributional&#13;
objective, i.e. between meeting, basic needs and raising the incomes of the&#13;
poor, has important implications, for judging the effectiveness of policy&#13;
instruments. A "basic needs" approach defines as a "leakage" any income&#13;
gain by the poor-not spent on "basic needs"; from the point of view of the&#13;
more general poverty alleviation objective, however, such "leaks" are&#13;
precisely the goal of poverty policy!&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
Third, how can governmental regulations and controls be designed&#13;
so as not to raise unnecessarily the cost of public or private urban service&#13;
provision, while yet preserving any beneficial impacts which they may have,&#13;
for instance controlling negative externalities of private actions? An&#13;
important issue in analyzing controls and regulations is for whom they&#13;
eliminate negative externalities, and for whom they raise the cost of&#13;
service provision,&#13;
The preceding paragraphs suggest that the efficiency of resource allocation&#13;
in cities can be improved while at the same time alleviating urban poverty.&#13;
Indeed, the analysis in subsequent chapters tends to support this claim.&#13;
This does not imply, however, the absence of a trade-off or conflict, since&#13;
there does remain in general the trade-off between alleviating poverty and&#13;
increasing efficiency on the one hand, and continued subsidization of&#13;
publicly supplied high-cost urban amenities for the better-off on the other&#13;
hand. For example, removing obstacles which impede the operations of small-&#13;
scale enterprises, street vendors, and the like, may reduce the sales by&#13;
large firms and established retail stores. Similarly, removing&#13;
the effective subsidies to private automobiles using congested city&#13;
streets, is a policy which can improve the efficiency of the urban transport&#13;
system and the quality of public transport for lower income groups, but&#13;
it also reduces the welfare enjoyed by those who have to substitute&#13;
public transport for the private automobile. Along the same lines,&#13;
eliminating subsidies for higher education, modern curative medical care,&#13;
and high-cost housing and instead investing in basic education and health,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
and low-cost urban infrastructure, will improve efficiency and help to&#13;
alleviate poverty, but it may  alko reduce the welfare of the better-oF.i&#13;
While this trade-off between benefits for the rich and those for the&#13;
poor does not pose any problems on ethical grounds to those concerned with&#13;
improving the lot of the poor, one should not underestimate the practical&#13;
problems of implementing policies oriented towards efficiency and poverty&#13;
alleviation, if they reduce benefits currently enjoyed by the economic&#13;
elite, who often also overlap with the political elite. In order to&#13;
overcome the objections of these elites and to enlist their support, one&#13;
will need to appeal to their altruistic sentiments--this is the political&#13;
basis for a "basic needs" strategy--, or impress on them the fact that&#13;
in the long term a high degree of urban inefficiency coupled with extensive&#13;
poverty will undermine their ability to continue leading the good life,&#13;
either because of revolutionary upheavals or because inefficiencies will&#13;
become so pervasive as to stifle economic opportunities for everyone,&#13;
The remainder of this paper will not have much to say about how&#13;
one can bring across this message to those in control, although at various&#13;
points it will be shown that steps can be taken to reduce the adjustment&#13;
costs for the established interest groups. Instead, it will be assumed&#13;
that the underlying political and economic forces favoring increased urban&#13;
efficiency and poverty alleviation will be strong enough to support policies&#13;
which work in that direction. While this may border on political naivety,&#13;
it is necessary to take this approach if one wants to be able to provide&#13;
policy prescriptions that are of broad applicability for cities in&#13;
developing countries. In support of this approach, one might also add&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
that the trends in urban po&amp;icy in LDCs are probably becoming more progres-&#13;
sive, i.e. geared to increase efficiency and alleviate poverty, than&#13;
they have been in the past. By way of example one may cite the increased&#13;
acceptance of more efficient and poverty-oriented policies in the areas&#13;
of urban transport investment and urban housing programs in many LDCs,&#13;
with Singapore serving as a show case.&#13;
B. The Dimensions of the Problem&#13;
The rapid urbanization process and explosive growth of cities in&#13;
LDCs can be interpreted as a story either of success, or of failure: On&#13;
the positive side, average incomes in cities are generally higher than&#13;
in the countryside, and proportionally fewer people live in poverty in&#13;
1/&#13;
urban as compared with rural areas. Considering the scale of population&#13;
movements to the cities, these have been remarkably smoothly absorbed&#13;
by cities in terms of providing employment, the means of livelihood, and&#13;
a modicum of basic services for many. Migrants on balance appear to be&#13;
"satisfied with their new lives, primarily because life is 'better' in&#13;
2/&#13;
the city than it was in their home communities."    On the negative side,&#13;
urban open unemployment as well as underemployment is frequently cited;&#13;
the disastrous living conditions in city slums are evident even to the&#13;
casual observer; and congestion and pollution in the large LDC metropoles&#13;
tend to be as bad as they are in the cities of developed&#13;
1/ As Thomas (1978) has demonstrated, however, one needs to be careful in&#13;
making such income comparisons since price levels may be substantially&#13;
higher in urban than in rural areas.&#13;
2/ Findley (1977), p. 23. In support of this observation, this author cites&#13;
a study of migrants in six LDC cities; in all but one city (Seoul), at least two&#13;
thirds of the migrants were satisfied relative to their former life for&#13;
themselves and for their children, and were unwilling to return to their&#13;
places of origin.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
countries. Both of these perspectives contain elements of truth, but in&#13;
isolation each misses important dimensions of urban development in LDCs.&#13;
The purpose of this section is to provide a summary overview of the most&#13;
important of these dimensions.-&#13;
Before reviewing the available statistics, however, a brief&#13;
but important note of caution must be expressed regarding the usefulness&#13;
of cross-country comparisons of statistics dealing with the dimensions of&#13;
urban development in LDCs. First, there are inherent weaknesses in many&#13;
of the data bases, relating especially to (a) biases in surveys and (b)&#13;
non-comparability of definitions across countries. Table II-1 gives a&#13;
vivid demonstration of the first problem using the example of housing&#13;
statistics in Bogota: Because of a more complete coverage of households&#13;
in Bogota, the 1973 Census figures differ drastically from those derived&#13;
from a large, but evidently biased, household survey carried out during the&#13;
same year. Often, there exists no possibility to check survey figures&#13;
against census data, and biases may therefore remain undetected. As regards&#13;
non-comparability of definitions, housing needs estimates are particularly&#13;
problematic, as are estimates of poverty or underemployment.- Second, global&#13;
statistics for the urban sector in LDCs can easily be misinterpreted because&#13;
they tend to gloss over important differences within the urban sector. For&#13;
instance, it is useful to distinguish between large, medium-size and&#13;
small cities in reporting such variables as household incomes, poverty&#13;
levels, service access, and the like. But even this is not enough:&#13;
/ Population growth data are not discussed in this paper; see Renaud (1979)&#13;
for population estimates and projections.&#13;
All tables are appended at the end of this chapter.&#13;
2/ See Webb (1976) for further examples.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
Cities of similar size within the same country can exhibit vast differences&#13;
in these statistics. Furthermore, within urban areas some sections differ&#13;
drastically in terms of employment opportunities (see Mohan, 1978, for&#13;
Bogota.), service availability, and health and nutrition conditions. Examples&#13;
vill be cited below. Care needs therefore to be taken in basing urban&#13;
policy design on broad data aggregates for the urban sector or for urban&#13;
areas, and the conclusions derived from cross-country comparisons can only&#13;
relate to very broad characterizations of urban development, rather than serve&#13;
for specific policy analysis or prescription. On the basis of this under-&#13;
standing one may proceed to review the evidence.&#13;
1. Employment and Incomes&#13;
The principal measures of how well urban areas in LDCs have absorbed&#13;
the rapid population influx are estimates of unemployment and underemployment&#13;
rates. Tables II-2 and II-3 summarize the available statistics as compiled&#13;
by Squire (1979). The salient feature of Table II-2 is that open unemployment&#13;
rates tend to be higher in urban than in rural areas. As Squire further&#13;
points out "within urban areas (open unemployment) is more serious for those&#13;
aged 15 to 24 than for the total' labor force, for females than for males,&#13;
and, at least up to post-secondary education, for the more educated than for the&#13;
less educated." -/ (Squire, 1979, p. 50)  Visible underemployment in general is&#13;
I/ For example, in Colombia the city of Cali (926,000 inhabitants) was estimated&#13;
in 1972 to have only 15 percent of households with insufficient public services9&#13;
while Barranquilla (725,000) had 70 percent. For Cucuta (220,000) the propor-&#13;
tion was 92 percent, while for Manizales (202,000) it was only 36 percent&#13;
(Linn, 1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
small, while estimates of invisible underemployment show that substantial&#13;
portions of the urban labor force may be affected in LDCs. But, as Squire&#13;
observes, invisible underemployment is really a measure of low productivity and&#13;
poverty, and as such is related to other measures of poverty which will be&#13;
discussed below.&#13;
Average household incomes tend to be systematically higher in&#13;
urban than in rural areas, and tend to be positively associated with city&#13;
size (Table II-4). Poverty indicators show that the incidence of poverty&#13;
varies considerably between regional country groupings (Table II-5).-1 Urban&#13;
poverty is particularly prevalent in South Asia, where the incidence of poverty&#13;
is estimated to be higher in urban areas than that in rural areas. In all&#13;
other regional country groupings, the proportion of average urban population&#13;
in poverty does not exceed 28 percent, while rural poverty population shares&#13;
exceed 40 percent everywhere, except in Europe, the Middle East, and North&#13;
Africa. As in the case of average incomes, average poverty indicators vary&#13;
with city size (Table VI-6). As a proportion of total city or regional&#13;
population, the lowest incidence of poverty is generally found in the largest&#13;
city, but increases as one passes to medium size and small towns.&#13;
2. Housing and Access to Infrastructure Services&#13;
The difficulty of defining and measuring housing conditions across&#13;
countries and cities has already been mentioned. Accordingly, estimates of&#13;
1/ The poverty levels shown in Table II-5 are defined as follows: the absolute&#13;
poverty income level is that income level below which a minimal nutritionally&#13;
adequate diet plus essential non-food requirements is not affordable. The&#13;
relative poverty income level is that income level less than one-third per&#13;
capita personal income of the country. Estimated population below poverty&#13;
income level is that portion of the population who are either "absolute&#13;
poor" or trelative poor" whichever is greater.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
the incidence on slum and squatter areas in selected cities of LDCs must&#13;
be taken with a large grain of salt (Table VI-7). Similarly, what spotty&#13;
information is available on the number of persons per room (Table VI-8)&#13;
cannot give much of an impression of the relative severity of the housing&#13;
problem across cities and countries, because the definition of a room varies&#13;
from census to census, and from, survey to survey. As a broad pattern one&#13;
may observe that the incidence of slums and squatter areas is in general&#13;
highest in Sub-Saharan Africa and in LAtin America. Overcrowding&#13;
as measured by the number of persons per room appears to be relatively&#13;
high in Asian countries, and in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, the variability&#13;
within regional country groupings and within countries is so large that&#13;
broad regional categorizations are not very useful. Moreover, as will be&#13;
discussed at length in Chapter VI below, the definition of the urban&#13;
housing problem in LDCs needs to be carefullv considered, and no simple&#13;
measure of housing needs or deficits is likely to be very helpful for&#13;
urban housing policy.&#13;
Somewhat less difficult and controversial are estimates of&#13;
access to urban infrastructure services, in particular to safe water supply,&#13;
excreta disposal, and electricity. And yet, even here problems arise.&#13;
Table II-8 shows the availability of electricity in homes, while&#13;
Table II-9 reports estimates of the proportions of urban and rural popu-&#13;
lation with access to watei supply and ezcreta disposal, where access is&#13;
11&#13;
quite broadly defined.   In general, it is clear that urban areas are on&#13;
average much better serviced than rural areas, and that for urban areas&#13;
1/  For water supply in urban areas, this definition includes standposts&#13;
located no more than 200 meters from house; in rural areas, the limit is&#13;
a reasonable amount of time spent on water fetching, which is obviously a&#13;
rather loose concept, For excreta disposal, any household system, such&#13;
as pit latrines, and water-borne sewerage systems are included.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-27-&#13;
the countries of Latin America and of Europe, the Middle East and North&#13;
Africa are on average better provided with these services than the countries&#13;
in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.-   Nevertheless, this progress,&#13;
and the relatively high degree of access in urban areas as compared with&#13;
rural areas must not deflect attention from the fact that substantial portions&#13;
of urban populations in LDCa do not have access to safe water or excreta&#13;
2/&#13;
disposal, even under this rather wide definition of what constitutes access.&#13;
The implications of this in terms of peor health and nutrition conditions&#13;
in slums will be investigated next.&#13;
3. Health and Nutrition&#13;
Health conditions on average tend to be better in urban. than in&#13;
rural areas of LDCs. In 1960, for instance, the crude death rate for rural&#13;
areas in LDCs was estimated as 21.7 and for urban areas as 15.4 (World Bank,&#13;
1975a). More recent comparisons of infant-mortality between urban and rural&#13;
areas tend to confirm the existence of an urban-rural health gap (Table II-10),&#13;
For nutrition, however, the picture is -more complicated. Table II-l1 shows&#13;
for selected countries that in terms of energy intake the rural dwellers&#13;
tend to fare better than the urban dwellers,     although this pattern is&#13;
reversed for intake of protein and fats. More importantly, however, there&#13;
I/ As regards differences in access to services by city-size, Meerman&#13;
(forthcoming), Selowsky (forthcoming), and Thomas (1978) have found that&#13;
service access tends to increase with city size in Malaysia, Colombia,&#13;
and Peru.&#13;
*21 Data collected by the U.N. show a more differentiated picture in terms of&#13;
service access, which confirms in essence the data presented here, but&#13;
also show  that "modern" services (i.e. in-house water connections, and&#13;
flush toilets) are particularly scarce in the Low Income countries (Sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa and Low-Income Asia), even for urban households (U.N., 1976).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
exists convincing evidence for a n-umber of cities in LDCs that the health&#13;
and nutrition levels of the slum populations are vastly below the city&#13;
average, and either close to or even below average rural levels (Tables&#13;
1/&#13;
II-12 and II-13).&#13;
The availability of curative health services as reflected by the&#13;
ratio of population to medical staff and hospital beds is generally&#13;
significantly higher in urban than in rural areas (Tables II-14 and II-15).&#13;
However, there is reason to believe that the urban poor have little access&#13;
to these services, and in any case this type of medical care does not deal&#13;
with the urgent need for preventive care for the poor (see Chapter VII below).&#13;
4. Education&#13;
Cross-country data on comparative levels of literacy and educational&#13;
status for urban and rural areas in LDCs do not appear to be readily available&#13;
(Webb, 1976), although there can be little doubt that urban dwellers on&#13;
average are better educated than rural dwellers, which is due in part to better&#13;
educational services in urban as compared with rural areas (Tables II-16 and II-17)&#13;
and in part is the result of selective migration of the better educated young&#13;
people from rural to urban areas (Findley, 1976). As in the case of health,&#13;
however, there is reason to believe that access to, and use of educational&#13;
services by school-age children is lower in the low.-incem- areas of cities&#13;
in LDCs, than is the case in the higher-income areas. The limited evidence&#13;
available on this point is cited in Chapter VII below.*/&#13;

Annex: A Conceptual Framework for Urban Policy Analysis&#13;
This annex presents a simple conceptual framework which may&#13;
help in pulling together the many strands of urban policy analysis&#13;
which will be pursued in the remainder of this paper.&#13;
Figure II-1 is used to demonstrate how efficiency and poverty&#13;
concerns may overlap or come in conflict with each other. Assume&#13;
that the two demand curves, Dp for poor consumers and DR for rich consumers&#13;
respectively, show each group's willingness to pay for a particular urban&#13;
good or service, and thus reflect the marginal private benefils received&#13;
1/&#13;
by each group. Furthermore, assume that in addition to private benefits,&#13;
there are external benefits associated with the consumption of the good or&#13;
service. These external benefits can consist in increases in the productivity,&#13;
in consumption benefits, or in cost savings for other individuals (or firms),&#13;
e.g. due to reduced public health hazards, or due to the increased educational&#13;
level of the population. They can also be of the "basic needs" variety, i.e.&#13;
reflecting the satisfaction which some individuals, especially among the higher&#13;
income classes may derive from seeing the basic needs of the poor consumer met.2/&#13;
These external benefits are added to private benefits, thus resulting in&#13;
two demand curves D and DR, respectively reflecting the sum of marginal&#13;
private and external benefits of consumption of the service under consi-&#13;
deration.  Note that marginal external benefits are assumed to decline with&#13;
1/ For the present purposes the possibility that private benefits exist&#13;
which are not reflected in users willingness to pay is assumed away.&#13;
It could be easily introduced as an additional consideration.&#13;
2/ For a discussion of this type of externality, see Harberger (1978).&#13;

increases in consumption and vanish for consumption in excess of Q.    This&#13;
reflects the fact that many external benefits, such as those derived from&#13;
improved general health and education levels can probably be met by provi-&#13;
sion of services at certain basic levels of quality and quantity. The same&#13;
is true, of course, virtually by definition, for the "basic needs" type&#13;
externalities.&#13;
Next, consider the two horizontal curves labeled C and C'.&#13;
These reflect the marginal costs of service provision, with C being the&#13;
cost curve for the service when it is publicly provided, and C? the cost&#13;
1/&#13;
curve when the service is privately supplied,   The difference in costs for&#13;
public and private provision of services -may derive from economies of scale&#13;
associated with the public sector's ability to build large production and&#13;
distribution networks Cespecially in the case of public utilities), and&#13;
from the elimination of -monopoly rents that -might be charged where the&#13;
service is provided by private sector suppliers.&#13;
If it is then assumed that the government wishes to ensure efficient&#13;
resource use by -marginal cost pricing, it would, in the absence of external&#13;
benefits, charge P = C to all consumers1 Despite the fact that marginal&#13;
costs are covered by the price charged, consumers derive a benefit from&#13;
public as campared with private service provision, which for each consumer&#13;
is equal to the area bounded by the vertical axis, by the two cost curves&#13;
C and Cf and by his private demand curve,   This benefit has been termed&#13;
11 For simplicity, it is assumed that C and C' are identical and constant&#13;
for each consumer.&#13;
21  There are well known limits to the rule that marginal cost pricing leads&#13;
to efficient resource allocation; for a recent summary, see Ray C1975).&#13;

"fiscal dividend" by some public finance economists (McLure, 1975).   If one&#13;
then also allows for the existence of externalities, efficient pricing&#13;
requires that the price for poor consumers be lowered to P", ensuring a&#13;
consumption level of Q" at which marginal social benefit (D ) equals marginal&#13;
p&#13;
social cost, C. This means that the poor private consumer, in addition to&#13;
his fiscal dividend also reapis the benefit of a subsidy.!' However, no&#13;
subsidy should be paid to the rich consumer, as long as the rich consumerTs&#13;
private demand curve (D ) intersects with the public cost curve C to the&#13;
R.&#13;
right of Q, even though external benefits are derived from his infra-marginal&#13;
consumption. A subsidy to the poor consumer might also be justified on&#13;
general equity grounds, i.e. in the interest of income redistribution. For&#13;
instance, PI might be charged to the poor consumer even in the absence of&#13;
external beneflits.  In this case, however, there is a loss in efficiency&#13;
as reflected by the difference between the total subsidy paid (the lower&#13;
shaded area in Figure II-1) and the increase in consumer benefits (i.e.&#13;
the area bounded by the vertical axis, P. P", and Dp). Also, there is a&#13;
loss in government revenue equal to the amount of the subsidy.&#13;

III. EMPLOYMENT AND THE URBAN POOR&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
The major determinant of urhan poverty i3 the fact that the incomes&#13;
earned by the poor through gainful employment are severely limited. Policies&#13;
designed to increase the employment and wages of the urban poor must therefore&#13;
be given foremost attention. Although the present chapter concentrates on&#13;
the scope for increasing the labor earnings of the poor, it does not attempt&#13;
to present an exhaustive analysis of urban employment issues and policies.&#13;
Other background papers prepared for World Development Report, 1979 permit&#13;
a more comprehensive understanding of urban employment and labor market&#13;
problems.-l The approach chosen here is therefore quite eclectic in two&#13;
respects: first, the focus throughout will be on the relationships between&#13;
urban employment and the urban labor market on the one hand, and urban poverty&#13;
on the other; and, second, primary attention will be given to those policy&#13;
instruments which can be deployed at the level cf an individual city or invest-&#13;
ment project. The impact of nation-wide policies, while not entirely neglected,&#13;
is not pursued in detail.&#13;
As will become obvious-in the ensuing discussion, this narrow view&#13;
on urban poverty and "local" policies has two major limitations: first, urban&#13;
poverty is intricately linked with the overall national and urban economy;&#13;
second, nation-wide policies are likely to provide the driving force over the&#13;
long term in solving the urbani employment problem in the developing world.&#13;
Nonetheless, the focus of this section was chosen because the elements&#13;
1/ See Squire (1979), Keesing (1979) and Renaud (1979), among others.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
57&#13;
emphasized here get easily lost in the shuffle of the typical wr.-:-C,-o::4  A.&#13;
1/&#13;
studies of urban employment and labor markets.   The following quotation from&#13;
Webb and Pfefferman (1978, p.47) applies to much of this chapter:&#13;
"While some of these suggestions may seem trivial, they all&#13;
address obstacles that stand in the way of the upward economic&#13;
mobility of the poor. These obstacles may seem small from the&#13;
viewpoint of the national economy; they may nevertheless be&#13;
insurmountable for the individuals standing in front of them.&#13;
In general, one of the most useful ways to improve the lot of&#13;
the poor (especially in a country like Brazil, where the&#13;
absorption into new employment outside agriculture has been&#13;
very rapid) is to analyze systematically the obstacles that&#13;
slow down the mobility of the poor. Often these obstacles&#13;
can be removed at. little cost and political conflict and so&#13;
make it easier for many of the poor to join the mainstream of&#13;
the economy."&#13;
In order to provide a better overview of the relationship between&#13;
urban employment, the urban labor market, and the urban poor this section&#13;
first considers the employment characteristics of the poor. It then describes&#13;
the major determinants of urban employment by discussing separately the supply,&#13;
and the demand for labor, and by considering the transactions-costs and&#13;
imperfections which affect the operations of the urban labor market. Finally,&#13;
the implications for policy will be summarized.&#13;
B. The Employment Characteristics of the Urban Poor&#13;
Although it may amount to setting up a straw man, it is useful to&#13;
begin by reviewing briefly what may be called the "conventional" employment&#13;
profile of the urban poor.   This profile draws on the popular notion that the&#13;
urban labor market may conveniently be separated into a "formal" and an "informal"&#13;
sector. These sectors are taken to be largely without linkages to each other&#13;
1/ Some of the case studies of urban labor markets carried out by the ILO are good&#13;
examples of this type of neglect. See, e.g., Lubell (1974), Joshi et al.&#13;
(1976), Schaefer and Spindel (1976).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
and are thought to possess a number of characteristics, which are, in&#13;
stylized fashion, summarized in Table II-I-1. While not all of these&#13;
characteristics are always attributed to the "formal" and "informal" sectors&#13;
1/&#13;
respectively, the contrasting elements shown in Table III-1 are frequently&#13;
2/&#13;
at the heart of the popular views regarding the urban labor market.&#13;
A review of the recently compiled evidence on urban labor&#13;
markets in LDCs, however, leads to a different, and much more compl¢x&#13;
picture than the simple dychotomy between "formal" and "informal"&#13;
labor markets shown in Table H1I-l would suggest.&#13;
First, urban open unemployment is in general not at the heart&#13;
of the urban poverty problem; the urban poor cannot afford to remain&#13;
without some form of employment, since they do not have any&#13;
alternative source of subsistence. In most countries and cities open&#13;
unemployment is accounted for by the relatively well-educated younger&#13;
members of the urban middle- and higher-income groups who can rely on&#13;
family support while they search for jobs that they find commensurate&#13;
with their training and wage expectations.3/&#13;
Second, the principal income earners of poor urban households&#13;
are found in virtually all types of employment: in large, medium, and&#13;
small-scale firms; in wage employment as well as in self- or family-&#13;
1/ And other u.__zacteristics may enter when an area other than employment&#13;
is considered.&#13;
2/ See for instance Bromley (1977), Mazumdar (1976), Peattie (1974), and&#13;
Perlman (1976) for critical reviews of elements of this profile; they&#13;
also provide ample examples for exponents of the "conventional" view.&#13;

employment; in the government and in the private sector; and across&#13;
all major types of urban activities.L/ Table III-2 provides a good&#13;
illustration of the diversity in employment patterns of the urban&#13;
poor. Furthermore, the poor are not necessarily those who have most&#13;
recently migrated to a city, and migrants do not tend to enter in&#13;
disproportionate numbers into what are considered typical "informal"&#13;
sector activities, such as street trading, shoeshining, etc.-/ In fact,&#13;
urban poverty appears to be associated with two principal employment&#13;
and household characteristics: One type of urban poor household is&#13;
characterized by low (and often irregular) earnings of the principal&#13;
(and secondary) income earners and by a high dependency ratio, due&#13;
to the large household size relative to the number of earners.3/&#13;
The other type of urban poor household is represented by what may be&#13;
called the "floating migrant," usually young single males who still have&#13;
close ties with their rural homes and who "float" into and out of&#13;
the city in response to urban labor availability, and seasonal labor&#13;
surplus in the countryside. This type of "floating migration" has been&#13;
observed, for instance, for the Sahelian countries of Africa (Cohen, 1978)&#13;
and for Baubay (Mazumdar, 1978). In geaeral, it is probably the former type&#13;

Third, entry to the activities carried out by the poor and to&#13;
the jobs held by them is not always unrestricted, nor are these activities&#13;
or jobs necessarily unregulated or untaxed by government. Sociological&#13;
research on street trading, shoeshining, sale of lottery tickets, small-&#13;
scale retailing and manufacturing has shown that entry to these activities&#13;
may in fact be quite restricted, particularly where locational advantage&#13;
is a major determinant of earnings, as for instance, in the case of&#13;
street trading, and where government restrictions on these activities at&#13;
choice locations (near churches, government buildings, central squares, etc.)&#13;
2/&#13;
limit the number of jobs that are available.   Moreover, government&#13;
regulation or control extends quite far down the ladder in the hierarchy&#13;
of employment opportunities generally available to the poor, as will be&#13;
obvious to anybody who has ever studied local government ordinances&#13;
relating to licensing, safety and hygiene regulations, etc. for all types&#13;
3/&#13;
of urban activities, including street vending, shoeshining, etc.&#13;
Similarly, tax payments or license fees are legally required for "informal"&#13;
1/ There are other identifiable, but usually relatively small groups of poor&#13;
or very poor people in LDC cities, whose characteristics vary from city to&#13;
city. In Bogota, for instance, one small, but very evident and especially&#13;
distressing group are the "gamines", i.e. young children typically between&#13;
the age of 5 and 15 who band together in small groups separate from their&#13;
families to eke out a miserable life. Another, more common set of very poor&#13;
people is found among households with female, sick or disabled heads of household.&#13;
2/ See for instance, Bromley (1977), Peattie (1974); entry may, however, be&#13;
quite unrestricted at locations where earnings opportunities are minimal.&#13;
3/ "As in most Latin American cities, the street traders of Cali are closely&#13;
regulated by the municipal and departmental authorities. Several hundred&#13;
pages of municipal and police regulations specify in great detail, where and&#13;
under what conditions, street trading may take place. All street traders are&#13;
expected to carry identity cards and other official documents, and most of them&#13;
are also expected to obtain trading licenses and health permits from the&#13;
municipal authorities."  (Bromley, 1977, p.6). For very similar observations&#13;
applying to street trading in Khartum, see International Labor Office (1976).&#13;

sector activities in most cities.-/ Of course, the degree of evasion&#13;
of these taxes and license requirements is generally substantial,-/ bat,&#13;
even where licenses are not obtained or taxes and fees are not paid, the&#13;
risk of official sanctions is often seriously interfering with the mode&#13;
3/&#13;
of operations of "informal" sector activities.-    The main point to be&#13;
made here is that public action may have a considerable impact on&#13;
informal sector employment and activities and this impact is usually of&#13;
the negative kind, by restricting the locations, or conditions under&#13;
which these activities may be carried out, by taxing them (at least sometimes),&#13;
or by the threat of enforcement of regulation and taxation, and by&#13;
occasional interruption of the 'activities and imposition of fines.&#13;
Fourth, the activities carried out by the poor, or the jobs&#13;
held by them, are often quite closely linkei to the activities of the&#13;
"modern" sector. Apart from the fact that some of the poor have low paid&#13;
jobs in the modern sector or in government, and that government regulation&#13;
and taxation extends its long arm tb the "informal" activities such as&#13;
street trading, there are important input and output linkages found&#13;
in many LDC cities between "formal" and "informal" sector activities.&#13;
Subcontracting is wide-spread, for instance, in Indian cities; -/ inputs&#13;
from modern sector whole-salers or markets are typically required even&#13;
1/ See for instance, the discussion of the municipal taxes and license&#13;
fees for Cartagena (Colombia) in Linn (1975).&#13;
2/ Bromley (1977) states that "almost all street traders contravene&#13;
official regulations in one way or another" (p. 7), See also&#13;
International Labor Office (1976) for similar practices in Sudan.&#13;
3/ For instance, the fear of official roundups limits the typical street&#13;
trade to offer only as much as he can quickly pack up and carry away&#13;
when the inspectors' truck appears at the street corner (Bromley, 1977, p.8).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
for street vending, small stores, and artisan and repair shops;-/ even&#13;
the outputs generated by scavengers ("pickers") on municipal garbage&#13;
dumps find their way very quickly into "modern" sector enterprises and&#13;
activities.2/  Capital requirements, especially working capital, are&#13;
frequently met (at exorbitant prices) by modern-sector suppliers of&#13;
inputs,3/ and basic operating equipment such as for rickshaws is often&#13;
provided, again at costly prices, by well-off intermediaries.4/ Moreover,&#13;
it has been observed that there may be something of a life-cycle in the&#13;
occupational patterns of the poor: As children or young adults they begin&#13;
to contribute to household earnings through jobs in "informal" sector&#13;
activities. With increasing age, experience, and (sometimes) education&#13;
or training they may move into "modern" sector employment, e.g., in the&#13;
construction sector; later, because of age or failing health, they return&#13;
to informal sector activities.5/&#13;
Finally, it is not correct to view all,or even most, of the&#13;
activities carried out by the urban poor as representing "residuial," or&#13;
"unproductive," or "superfluous" employment.  As was pointed out earlier,&#13;
many poor are employed in modern sector activities, albeit at low wages&#13;
and with low productivity. Moreover, while this has not been proven in&#13;
any rigorous fashion it is quite likely that at the low income levels&#13;

4/ Cousins (1977).   Even lottery tickets in Bogota which oste- ibly are&#13;
made available for sale by the very poor in order to ger ate some&#13;
employment for these groups, frequently find their way through the&#13;
hands of relatively well-do-do intermediaries (PeatLie, 1974).&#13;

systems, as well as the absence of broadly dispersed automobile ownership,&#13;
there is a role to be played by the long and diversified chain of inter-&#13;
mediaries in production and distribution.-/ Similarly, where solid waste&#13;
has a high value relative to people's incomes, scavenging on public&#13;
waste dumps becomes an economically viable&#13;
activity.   Indeed, the view of the "informal" sector activities&#13;
as basically unproductive, undesirable and unworthy of public support&#13;
-- if not in fact worthy of public scorn and efforts at eradication --&#13;
reflects a profoundly non-economic view of this sector, which is akin&#13;
to the Marxist distinction between "productive" and "unproductive"&#13;
activities. As an economist, who accepts the test of the market as a&#13;
prima facie criterion for productivity, all informal sector activities&#13;
that provide employment to the poor are "productive." Only the intro-&#13;
duction of value judgements regarding the nature of the output (e.g.,&#13;
the fact that street traders provide anL ungainly sight to the upper income&#13;
groups) leads to the notion of informal sector activities being&#13;
"unproductive," "superfluous," or "undesirable." 2/  In other words,&#13;
1/ This point is made in Peattie (1974).&#13;
2/ One might want to argue that negative externalities are imposed&#13;
by unrestrained informal sector activities, especially in terms of&#13;
the "nuisance" which they generate for the (relatively few) wealthy&#13;
urban dwellers. However, even then, value judgements are inevitable,&#13;
for what weight is one to give to these externalities in practice?&#13;
In the typical LDC city the official views are dominated by&#13;
the interests of the elite and thus the weight given to the "nuisance"&#13;
impacts of informal sector activity is substantial. If one were to&#13;
give a low weight in evaluating them, then very likely one would come&#13;
to view "informal" sector activities on balance in a more positive&#13;
light.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
the objectives of policy makers crucially determine their response to&#13;
the "informal" sector, and indeed to practically all manifestations&#13;
of urban poverty (including slum settlemencs, etc.). If the objective&#13;
is to minimize the visibility of these manifestations and of the impact&#13;
of urban.poverty on the middle and higher income classes, then, of course,&#13;
informal sector activities and employment in particular, are viewed&#13;
as "unproductive," "undesirable," and as something to be repressed and&#13;
eradicated wherever possible. On the other hand, if the objective&#13;
of public policy makers is to assist the urban poor to make the best&#13;
of a bad situation, i.e., to try and maximize their w%elfare within the&#13;
constraints set by national resource availability and the limits on&#13;
outright resource redistribution, then "informal" sector activities&#13;
must be viewed as extremely important contributions worthy of public&#13;
support and encouragement.&#13;
One of the primary conclusions of the review of the employment&#13;
characteristics of the urban poor is therefore that one should not start&#13;
by defining "informal" sector activities, such as street trading,&#13;
shoeshining, scavenging, artisanry and street-corner repair work, etc.&#13;
as negative phenomena. Indeed, unless strong economic or social arguments&#13;
1/ This set of arguments follows in essence those put forth by&#13;
Perlmani (1976).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
exist to the contrary,-/  these activities ought to be interfered with&#13;
as little as possible, and to be supported where'resources permit, so&#13;
that they may operate on an equal footing with their formal sector&#13;
competitors. Of course, this potential competition is part of the&#13;
reason why certain fiformal sector activities are restricted or&#13;
suppressed (especially in the prime urban locations). Given the&#13;
resistanee of entrenched interest, it may not be easy to introduce&#13;
this positive and supportive view of the informal sector, especially&#13;
where local government action is required.-/   For this reason it may be&#13;
desirable to address this issue at the national level through appropriate&#13;
legislation. This may also be important in order to achieve uniformity across&#13;
cities and thus to avoid that local governments adopt a "beggar-my-neighbor"&#13;
policy in this area, trying to attract the "elite" activities from&#13;
other cities by providing an environment substantially free from the&#13;
"nuisance" of competition of informal sector activities.&#13;
Another implication of the employment profile of the urban&#13;
poor as summarized above, is that the urban poor are a very heterogeneous&#13;
grop   as regards their employment characteristics.   In this respect they&#13;
are quite different from the typical rural poor, who are found among&#13;
the landless laborers and the small-scale farmers, and who usually form&#13;
l/  For instance, where there is clear evidence that the operations of the&#13;
informal market contravene basic norms of ethics and law (rather than&#13;
of aesthetics), as in the case of drug trading or (possibly) smuggling.&#13;
2/ Further complicating matters is that the immediate losers of a more&#13;
supportive public attitude towards such activities as street trading&#13;
may be other occupations which are carried out by people not much better&#13;
off, as for example, those merchants occupying booths in the municipal&#13;
markets (Bromley, 1977).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
rather homogeneous groups across relatively easily identifiable geographic&#13;
areas. The rural poor therefore represent a fairly well identifiable target&#13;
group, whose income earning capacity may be increased through uniformily applied&#13;
measures such as land reform, improved technologies, better farm prices,&#13;
extension services, input or marketing cooperatives, and the like. While&#13;
none of these measures are particularly easy to implement for a number of&#13;
reasons which need not be spelled out here, the fact remains that it is&#13;
much more difficult to identify the urban poor as a target group when&#13;
trying to improve their income earnings capacity through similar measures,&#13;
such as input or marketing cooperatives, extension services, support of&#13;
small-scale enterprises, etc. The types of activities vary widely,&#13;
the technologies are diverse, the same types of activities are carried&#13;
out by the wealthier and the poorer segments of the population. As a result&#13;
it becomes very difficult (a) to identify one or a few urban poverty target&#13;
groups along the dimension of employment or economic activity,&#13;
and (b) to provide effective assistance, even where such&#13;
target groups have been identified.-V This is not to&#13;
imply that city or project specific, target-group oriented measures&#13;
should be abandoned, if on balance one has reason to believe that they&#13;
increase the demand for certain labor categories and activities carried&#13;
out by the urban poor, that they improve the quality of the labor which&#13;
the poor supply and thus their productivity and wages, or that they reduce&#13;
transactions costs and market imperfections which reduce the employment&#13;
or real wage of the poor. Rather, the point is that in general the "leakage"&#13;
1/ See Webb (1976) for further arguments along this line.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
from these measures, defined in terms of positive effects to wealthier&#13;
groups and possibly negative effects on other poor groups (who may be&#13;
competing with the benefiting labor or activity category) may be&#13;
significant. This makes general measures designed to increase the demand&#13;
for labor, to raise the productivity of labor, or to reduce labor market&#13;
imperfections through appropriate macro-economic policies- more attrac-&#13;
tive, since it may well be that they are as effective in reaching the poor,&#13;
as are the so-called target-group oriented programs, in terms of the&#13;
number of beneficiaries reached and in terms of the administrative costs&#13;
incurred.2/&#13;
One argument which is at times leveled against macro-economic&#13;
policies to increase urban employment is that they fail to "trickle down"&#13;
to "informal" sector activities, and thus to the poor. Apart from the&#13;
fact that the poor are not exclusively employed in the "informal" sector,&#13;
it was argued above that there are considerable linkages between the&#13;
activities usually identified respectively with these two sectors.&#13;
While the exact extent of job creation may be subject to argument,-/&#13;
there is reason to be fairly optimistic on this score, especially if the&#13;
transactions costs and market imperfections affecting the creation&#13;
of informal sector jobs are reduced to a minimum.4/&#13;
1/ These policies, as well as the target group or project-oriented policies,&#13;
will further be discussed in the following sections of this chapter.&#13;
2/ Another implication is that it makes other types of target-group oriented&#13;
policies, particularly the "basic needs" approach, a more direct means&#13;
with which to improve the welfare of the poor -with relatively low&#13;
"leakages" and at reasonable administrative cc,;ts.&#13;
3/ Waide (1978, p.7), for instance, maintains that in India "one primary&#13;
manufacturing job generally leads to 3-4 formal sector service Jobs and&#13;
at least the same number of informal sector jobs."&#13;
4/  This argument applies, especially in South Asia, but possibly to a&#13;
lesser extent in Latin America.&#13;

C. Urban Employment and the Urban Labor Market&#13;
Any partial approach to the analysis of employment and labor&#13;
market problems is fraught with pitfalls, because of the important&#13;
linkages which exist between different employment and skill categories,&#13;
between different labor market segments (within cities, as well as&#13;
between cities and rural areas), and between d#fferent determinants of&#13;
labor supply and demand determinants. Although a general equilibrium&#13;
analysis of labor market interactions may be required to permit a&#13;
conclusive evaluation of the impacts of alternative policy instruments&#13;
designed to improve the employment prospects of the urban poor, this&#13;
1/&#13;
section does not develop such a general-equilibtium approach.    Its&#13;
purpose is to survey briefly the major determinants of urban labor supply&#13;
and demand, anid to discuss some of the transactions costs and imperfections&#13;
often marring the workings of the urban labor markets in LDCs. Wherever&#13;
possible, important linkages and indirect effects of policies will be&#13;
flagged.&#13;
Over the longer term--and there can be little doubt that most employ-&#13;
ment policies will need considerable time before becoming effective--the&#13;
goal of employment and labor market policies must be to increase (shift)&#13;
the demand for urban labor more rapidly than the increase in the labor&#13;
supply taking place simultaneously at all skill levels, but particularly&#13;
at the lower end of the skill distribution. At the same time it is important to&#13;
reduce transactions costs which cut into the real wage earned by labor. and also&#13;

labor market models.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

to reduce market imperfections which hinder the mobility of labor, in&#13;
particular the upward mobility of those employed in low produttivity and&#13;
wage occupations.&#13;
1. Urban Labor Supply&#13;
The size and distribution of a city's labor supply is determined&#13;
by a number of well-known factors which will only be briefly summarized.&#13;
These are the natural population growthi in the city, the net migration to&#13;
(or from) the city, the labor force participation rate, and the human capital&#13;
embodied in the labor force, i.e., the availability of skills and the health&#13;
of the labor force, both of which affect the quality of the urban labor supply.&#13;
a. Natural Population Growth&#13;
The first determinant of urban labor supply is natural&#13;
population growth of the city's population, which in turn is&#13;
determined by the fertility and death rates of the&#13;
urban population. Improved health and nutrition would tend to&#13;
reduce the death rate, while greater efforts at family planning&#13;
-- as well as the impact of rising incomes and higher levels&#13;
of education -- may induce secular declines in the urban&#13;
fertility rate. There is some reason to believe that the&#13;
declines in fertility on balance outweigh the decline in the&#13;
death rate particularly in urban areas, thus leading to a&#13;
gradual decline in the natural growth rate of most cities in&#13;
developing countries.- Considering that somewhere between&#13;
40 to 60 percent of the population growth in cities of developing&#13;
countries is due to natural growth rather than immigration&#13;
1/ This is the assumption implicit in most population projections;&#13;
see e.g. World Development Indicators, 1979, Table 17 (Annex to World&#13;
Bank, 1979).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
(Table III-3), national and urban governments should pay at least&#13;
as much attention to policies that can help control the natural&#13;
population increase in urban areas, as they tend to give to&#13;
policies designed to deal with the problem of rural-urban migration.&#13;
This is of particular relevance in Latin America where the average&#13;
percentage of urban population growth accounted for by natural&#13;
population growth is expected to reach some 75 percent in the&#13;
period 1980-90 (Table III-3). Measures aimed at reducing fertility,&#13;
in particular "education, extension, and service provision for&#13;
family planning become increasingly feasible within the confines&#13;
of urban areas. Many of the inhibiting forces such as religions&#13;
and social traditions are weakened. Economic sanctions are&#13;
reversed; an additional child can be a clear economic liability&#13;
in the city and a long-term asset to the social security system&#13;
in rural areas." (Beier et al., 1975, p. 46) These considerations&#13;
would imply that it may be easier to reduce fertility in urban&#13;
than in rural areas, provided that serious efforts are made at&#13;
introducing family planning policies. This is an area where the&#13;
role played by city-level authorities can be very important and&#13;
the scope for project-specific action is considerable, but these&#13;
opportunities have often been neglected in national family&#13;
planning programs.l/&#13;
b. Migration&#13;
Migration is the other important determinant of urban population&#13;
growth, and thus of the growth in the urban labor force. The usual&#13;

focus is on the net migration from rural to urban areas, but also&#13;
of importance are the urban-to-urban migration flows that take&#13;
place in many developing countries. The latter phenomenon&#13;
is particularly important from the perspective of the smaller&#13;
towns and intermediate size cities which may be facing a net&#13;
migration outflow./ The evidence on migration determinants is&#13;
2/&#13;
well documented- and need not be reviewed in detail here.&#13;
Suffice it to say that migrants tend to respond mainly to perceived&#13;
differentials in economic opportunities between their original&#13;
location and their final destination. In particular the&#13;
superior availability of jobs is a major reason for migration&#13;
to the cities, combined with the expectation of better education&#13;
facilities for the children of the migrants. Migrants are&#13;
relatively young,-3 and tend to be well-educated and highly&#13;
motivated relative to the population at the point of origin.&#13;
Cities which receive migrants are thus not, on balance, burdened&#13;
with a flood of uneducated, unskilled and unmotivated individuals&#13;
and households, although there is little doubt that rural-urban&#13;
migration tends to keep urban wages down (particularly among&#13;
the skill groups to which migrants belong) below the levels&#13;
which would prevail in the absence of migration. The selectivity&#13;
1/ In Colombia, for instance, 5 out of 22 departmental (state) capital&#13;
cities experienced net out migration according to 1973 census figures&#13;
(Linn, 1978).&#13;
2/ E.g., Findley (1977). See also Squire (1979).&#13;
3/ This is a factor which affects the demographic structure of cities&#13;
and has important implications for the fertility rates in cities,&#13;
and for the need for public services. These considerations will be&#13;
dealt with later.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
of migration in terms of education, skill, and motivation, which&#13;
has been diagnosed as creating problems in the rural areas, has&#13;
similar, and possibly more far reaching impacts in the stagnating&#13;
smaller and intermediate-size cities, where the most mobile&#13;
individuals and households tend to be found among the well-educated&#13;
and highly skilled groups. Their departure for the large and&#13;
dynamic cities prevents the building up of a diversified labor&#13;
supply, which in turn might attract private investors and could&#13;
lead to improvements in the quality of local management and public&#13;
administration, which are generally very weak in these cities.&#13;
Two main points may be derived from this discussion of&#13;
migration: First, migration is one of the facets of urban labor&#13;
markets where the interaction between demand and supply of&#13;
labor is most pervasive. Increases (or declines) In urban&#13;
labor demand will affect migration, and thus labor supply not&#13;
only in the aggregate, but also in terms of its composition.&#13;
Whether or not migration responses are "exessive," i.e., drawing&#13;
more migrants into the city than is warranted by the availability&#13;
of employment and thus leading to increased urban un- or under-&#13;
1/&#13;
employment, is an issue which cannot be resolved here,-    In any&#13;
case, and this is thc second point to be made, the migration&#13;
issue needs to be addressed at the national level through&#13;
nationwide policies geared to change, to the extent possible,&#13;
1/ See for instance, Friedmann and Sullivan (1974) for civattons of studies&#13;
which support the theory of "excessive" migration. For a contrasting&#13;
evidence see Mazumdar (1978) and Waide (1978).    Squire (1979)&#13;
addresses this issue in greater detail.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-76-&#13;
the size and composition of migration flows.-     There&#13;
is little that can, or should, be done at the&#13;
level of the individual city to affect or control migration&#13;
flows. Indeed, such commonly found measures as restrictions&#13;
on informal sector activities and employment, the bull-dozing&#13;
of slums or squatter settlements, the forceful relocation of&#13;
slum dwellers to peripheral rural areas, the withholding of&#13;
urban infrastructure or social services, where these could be&#13;
provided within the resource constraints of the low*-income&#13;
beneficiaries and the local authorities, all these efforts have&#13;
many times been shown not to affect the migration flows signi-&#13;
ficantly, while at the same time seriously impeding the efficiency&#13;
of large segments of the urban factor and goods markets,&#13;
destroying valuable capital stock, and wreaking havoc with the&#13;
lives and welfare of the majority of the urban population affected&#13;
21&#13;
by those policies./ By implication., one may also conclude that&#13;
a constructive approach to the absorption of the growing urban&#13;
population at the individual city level, for instance, by&#13;
encouraging, rather than hampering informal sector activities&#13;
and employment, and by improving, instead of destroying slums,&#13;
will not by itself stimulate migration to any great extent.&#13;
In fact, other measures designed to increase the efficiency of&#13;
1/ See Renaud (1979) for a discussion of such policies.&#13;
2/  See for instance Yap (1976) and Findley (1977).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
77 -&#13;
the urban.economy, in particular the pricing of public services&#13;
at marginal social cost (including not only public utilities,&#13;
but also the use of scarce urban road space), may have much more&#13;
important, albeit indirect impacts on migration. By reducing&#13;
the effective subsidies which private investors can reap by&#13;
investing in the large cities one may lead them to consider&#13;
investment locations elsewhere and thus contribute to an&#13;
increased availability of jobs outside the large cities. /&#13;
The scope for increased efficiency in the provision and use&#13;
of urban public services will be extensively studied in the&#13;
following chapters of this study. The main point to be made&#13;
here is that the migration impact of local actions&#13;
are likely to be minimal and therefore should not determine&#13;
the type of policies pursued.&#13;
c. Labor Force Participation Rate&#13;
The labor force participation rate determines what proportion&#13;
of the working-age population actually offers its services in&#13;
the labor market.  This variable is again crucially linked&#13;
to the labor demand side, since among the most important deter-&#13;
minants of the labor force participation rate are economic ones,&#13;
such as the opportunities for employment and the level of wages&#13;
offered.-/ More important in the present context are two further&#13;
1/ Not too much should be made of these effects, given our limited knowledge&#13;
of the relative strength of the determinants of rrivate investment decisions.&#13;
The point remains, however, that improvements in the efficiency of urban&#13;
economies, if anything, would tend to lead to a decentralization of economic&#13;
activities and therefore of population.&#13;
2/ Social and cultural factors may also determine the extent to which especially&#13;
the women, and the young and the old participate in the labor force. Among&#13;
demographic factors, the age structure is the single most important deter-&#13;
minant of labor force participation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -&#13;
considerations: First, public action at the city level may be&#13;
important in raising the transactions costs associated with&#13;
finding and keeping employment. Lowering or raising these&#13;
transactions costs may have important impacts on whether or&#13;
not certain potential labor groups enter or drop out of the&#13;
labor market. Studies of urban labor markets have indicated&#13;
that the labor force participation rate of secondary income&#13;
earners, and especially of women, is quite sensitive to&#13;
transportation costs, licensing requirements, and the like.l/&#13;
Second, the poor households are particularly in need of&#13;
secondary employment opportunities, while they are at the&#13;
same time especially sensitive to transactions costs, given&#13;
that the margin between the (low) money wage they earn, and&#13;
the opportunity cost of staying at home is generally extremely&#13;
slim and can easily be outweighed by transportation costs,&#13;
licensing requirements, risks associated with illegal (i.e.,&#13;
unlicensed) work, etc. City- or project-specific actions&#13;
to reduce transactions costs, e.g. by appropriate land use&#13;
planning, a rational transportation pi"cy, and sensible&#13;
(i.e., minimal) licensing requirements may affect the labor&#13;
participation rate especially for poor income earners and thus&#13;
increase their family incomes.&#13;
1/ See Perlman (1976), Sant' Anna et al. (1976). The general question&#13;
of transactions costs and labor market imperfections will be taken&#13;
up furtlher below.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
d. Human Capital&#13;
The final determinants of the labor supply which will be&#13;
considered here, cover a number of factors which are usually&#13;
referred to as th,&gt; htman capital, including the education and&#13;
skill-level of the population, as well as its health and nutrition&#13;
status. These factors determine very crucially the composition&#13;
add quality of the labor supply. The basic difficulty with&#13;
these factors is that while they are important areas of national&#13;
and urban policy intervention our understanding of their implica-&#13;
tions is still extremely limited. This is not for lack of&#13;
research or information on many aspects of human capital formation,&#13;
but rather because of the extremely complex set of interrelationships&#13;
which are at work.- In particular we have only little firm&#13;
knowledge on the relationship between investments in education,&#13;
health and nutrition on the one hand, and labor productivity&#13;
and employment on the other. Much of the quantitative results&#13;
that are available suffer from the fact that they were. derived&#13;
from partial equilibrium analyses which do not allow for&#13;
the compl&amp;xities of the general equilibrium framework in which&#13;
the policies operate.  The available data must therefore be&#13;
interpreted with caution.&#13;
Education and training affect the skill level and the&#13;
expectations of the labor force. They increase its productivity&#13;
1/  See for instance, World Bank '1975a) on the complexity of the education-&#13;
health-nutrition-family plan:,'ng interrelationships. See also Chapter VII&#13;
below for a discussion of social services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
if placed in occupations commensurate with the acquired skill&#13;
level, and infiuence the reservation wage of job see.re     whn&#13;
are attempting to locate jobs commensurate with their expectations.&#13;
The latter may indeed become a problem where education of a&#13;
certain type (usually higher education,-J or in a few countries&#13;
even universal primary education,') has created a surplus of a&#13;
particular type of labor, and therefore open unemployment, since&#13;
the individuals concerned are willing (and able) to remain unemployed&#13;
in the hope of getting a high-prestige and well-paying job,&#13;
rather than moving down the employment ladder to a lower-paying&#13;
3/&#13;
job at lesser prestige-/ As was mentioned before, this is not&#13;
a problem generally affecting the poor or very poor, although&#13;
in some cases poverty is associated with open unemploymer.t&#13;
of one or more members of a household.&#13;
More typical is the case where the upward mobility of the&#13;
low income groups is limited by their lack of skills, training&#13;
and education which would permit them to find higher-productivity&#13;
and higher-wage jobs. Indeed, many of the studies on urban&#13;
wage determination have found that muich, if not most of the wage&#13;
differentials in the urban labor markets may be explained by&#13;
basic human capital variables.4/ This supports the hypothesis&#13;
1/ For example, in Colombia (Berry, 1974; Peattie, 1974) and India (Friedmann&#13;
and Sullivan, 1974).&#13;
2/ Possibly in Ceylon and Kenya.&#13;
3/ The existence of unemployment also indicates, and is predicated on, the&#13;
existence of labor market imperfections (Squire, 1979).&#13;
4/  See, e.g., Mazumdar (1978), Mazumdar and Ahmed (1978), Sant' Anna (1976).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
81&#13;
that there are substantial private (and presumably social) returns&#13;
to education and training../&#13;
The extent to which education -- broadly defined to include&#13;
all types of formal and non-formal education and training --&#13;
can contribute to solve the problem of urban poverty, differs&#13;
from country to country as does the type of educational programs&#13;
or efforts required. For example, in Latin America literacy&#13;
is at such high a level, particularly in urban areas, that&#13;
continued heavy investments in primary education are probably not&#13;
of high priority. Instead, a combination of expanded and improved&#13;
secondary education and of improved and flexible educational&#13;
facilities for out-of-school children and adolescents were&#13;
emphasized. In contrast, for the other LDCs where illiteracy&#13;
is still of major proportions in many cases, the expansion of&#13;
primary school education is crucial, albeit in combination with&#13;
other schemes to reach the urban poor, in particular the adolescents&#13;
The main point about educational policy is that in each country&#13;
one needs to identify those skill classes where a given amount&#13;
of investment in education will contribute most in terms of&#13;
releasing bottlenecks, and in terms of moving large numbers of&#13;
1/ Mazumdar and Ahmed (1978), however, indicate that at the lower end of&#13;
the skill arid wage pyramid, on-the-job experience may be more important&#13;
than formal education in determining the wage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -&#13;
low-skilled individuals to higher skill jobs, without generating&#13;
unemployment or reducing wages in the higher skill levels to&#13;
the point where the additional education is no longer worthwhile.&#13;
This is, of course, a very difficult task, and the only generali-&#13;
zation for overall education policy, which may be feasible at&#13;
this point is that in many, if not most countries a move towards&#13;
increased emphasis on improvements in the skills, education,&#13;
and training of the poor is likely to be a move in the right&#13;
direction, given the heavy emphasis in the past on educational&#13;
programs benefitting primarily the rich.&#13;
More will be said abo;nt education in Chapter VII.&#13;
Suffiee it to conclude the discussion here with the comment&#13;
that urban authorities may have a considerable scope in shaping&#13;
the educational programs so that they are -- or are not -- of&#13;
1/&#13;
benefit to the poor- While basic educational policies, investment&#13;
strategies, curricula, and financing mechanisms are controlled&#13;
by the national (or state) government, urban authorities often&#13;
have a considerable latitude in deciding on such issues as&#13;
location of educational facilities within the urban area, staffing,&#13;
and in some cases even program and curriculum design, particularly&#13;
where Innovative experiments are conducted at the city level.&#13;
The impact of educational policies on the quality and composi-&#13;
tion of the urban labor supply is, of course, a matter of long&#13;
term development. The same holds true for health and nutrition&#13;
1  See, for instance, Bird (1978) for a discussion of the interrelationship&#13;
of national and local authorities in urban education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -&#13;
programs, especially where these are designed to reach pregnant&#13;
women, lactating mothers, and young children. The fact that&#13;
improved health and nutrition"/ contribute  to increase the&#13;
productivity of the labor force due to reduced absenteeism&#13;
and increased effort and motivation while on the job is well-&#13;
established./ The main uncertainty relates to the extent of&#13;
the productivity increases; the extent to which productivity&#13;
increases are actually translated into income increases where&#13;
unemployment and underemployment are prevalent; and the&#13;
appropriate measures to achieve improvements in health and&#13;
nutrition levels. This is not the place to explore these&#13;
problems in great detail, but two points should be made:&#13;
First, ill health and poor nutrition are problems which&#13;
affect primarily the poor in LDCs and reduce their welfare&#13;
in terms of the reduction of their incomes below what&#13;
they could earn with better health and nutrition, and in terms&#13;
of their basic welfare. Thus, one may be satisfied with a rough&#13;
and ready calculus of the productivity gains resulting from&#13;
improved health ahd nutrition levels, as long as one can be&#13;
sure that a country's or city's health and nutrition programs&#13;
actually reach the poor. The focus thus, as with most "basic&#13;
needs" - type public policies, must be on program design and&#13;
l/ There exists a strong two-way relationship between these two areas;&#13;
see Reutlinger and Selowsky (1976), World Bank (1975a), and Chapter VII&#13;
below.&#13;
2/ For examples, see World Bank (1975a), p. 25.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-84-&#13;
implementation in order to ensure that the primary goal, in&#13;
this case improved health and nutrition of the poor, is&#13;
achieved. If one can be reasonably certain on this count,&#13;
then one can also be quite confident as regards the employment&#13;
and productivity impact./ The second point to be made here&#13;
as in the case of education is that while basic health and&#13;
nutrition policies are set ,t the national level and are ezecuted&#13;
often through national agencies, local authorities in many&#13;
cities play a major role in these areas, either as providers&#13;
of services in their own rights, or as executing agents of&#13;
the national (state) government.- There may thus be considerable&#13;
scope for improvement even within a particular city and project,&#13;
2. Urban Labor Demand&#13;
The basic ques ion to be answered in this section is how the&#13;
urban labor supply can be absorbed with increased labor earnings, so as&#13;
to increase the incomes especially of the poor, who have to rely virtually&#13;
exclusively on labor earnings derived from low-productivity occupations.&#13;
Increasing the demand for labor is of particular importance where un-&#13;
or underemployment among the lowest skill levels is a prevalent phenomenon,&#13;
and where the scope for measures designed to raise the productivity of&#13;
1/ Program design and implementation issues are taken up in&#13;
Chapter VII.&#13;
2/ Water suppiy and waste disposal are generally the responsibility of local&#13;
governments in the medium and large cities of LDCs. They frequently&#13;
also carry out environmental health programs and are responsible for&#13;
neighborhood health centers, etc. See Bahl and Linn (forthcoming),&#13;
Chapter 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -&#13;
the urban poor (especially through improved education, health and nutrition)&#13;
is limited by the absence of an effective demand for the services of the&#13;
improved labor supply. Of course, demand and supply oriented policies&#13;
must go hand in hand, since the urban employment problem is rarely one&#13;
restricted to either demand or supply limitations. Usually, bottlenecks&#13;
in the availability of specific labor skill categories coexist with&#13;
relative abundance of labor supply in other categories. The special&#13;
and difficult task of employment policy in LDCs is to identify&#13;
these distinct categories correctly and to design policy&#13;
measures which will provide for supply and demand adjustments&#13;
that are appropriate for, and limited to each of these labor/skill&#13;
categories. The heterogeneity of the urban labor market, as compared&#13;
with the rural labor market, which was previously co$mented on,&#13;
significantly complicates this task. Furthermore, demand and supply&#13;
conditions vary across countries and over time, and even to a certain&#13;
extent within countries across regions and cities. This point has&#13;
already been emphasized for the supply side in the context of the&#13;
discussion of education policies, but it applies also to the&#13;
demand side. In some countries, such as Nigeria, Iran, Algeria and Syria,&#13;
World Bank economic analysis has indicated that labor demand is not a&#13;
binding constraint, while in many, if not most other countries, labor&#13;
demand deserves special attention.     Furthermore, it may well be the&#13;
case that in the largest cities of LDCs there is a relative over-supply&#13;
of skilled and highly educated individuals, while in the intermediate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 86 -&#13;
and smaller towns and in the rural areas there is a dearth of highly&#13;
skilled labor and management relative to the potential demand for it.&#13;
In all but a few cases, however, it is probably true to say that increased&#13;
demand for low- and un-skilled urban labor would tend to improve the&#13;
incomes of the poor by increasing the extent of their employment as&#13;
well as raising their wages. Since unskilled labor is a factor&#13;
of production which is very abundant in supply in developing countries,&#13;
policies designed to increase the demand for it should have a high priority,&#13;
not only on grounds of equity and poverty alleviation, but also&#13;
on grounds of efficient resource allocation.&#13;
The remainder of this section discusses various determinants&#13;
of urban labor demand: the overall growth of the economy, the growth&#13;
of industrial and service activities, the choice of technology, and&#13;
the growth and management of particular urban areas.&#13;
a. Overall Growth of the Economy&#13;
The overall growth of the economy is on the whole a&#13;
powerful determinant of labor demaxnd: A high growth rate&#13;
will lead to more rapid labor absorption throughout the&#13;
economy in urban and rural areas alikeT Furthermore, any&#13;
structural adjustments to improve the composition of labor&#13;
supply and to reduce the inefficiencies generated by market&#13;
failures in the labor market as well as in the goods and&#13;
other factor markets are made easier when the economy grows&#13;
rapidly, since the resistance by groups with entrenched interests&#13;
in the status quo (e.g., restricted entry, government regulations, etc.)&#13;
1/  See Squire (1979) on this point foL evidence.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -&#13;
is likely to be less difficult to overcome&#13;
when the total employment pie grows rapidly. Conversely,&#13;
when an economy stagnates, labor abserption is a much more&#13;
pressing problem, and structural adjustments become much&#13;
more difficult to implement. Korea and Brazil would be good&#13;
examples for the growth economies, where the labor absorption&#13;
problem, while not entirely absent, is&#13;
a relatively minor problem, and where structural&#13;
1/&#13;
adjustments are undertaken at least to some extent.-   At the&#13;
other end of the spectrum are, for instance, the countries of&#13;
the Sahelian region in Africa, where due to the dismal economic&#13;
growth prospects (which are mainly explained by the extreme&#13;
ecoilogical difficulties encountered in recent years in the&#13;
agriciiltural sector and by the absence of a strong and dynamic&#13;
industrial base) the labor absorption process in the rural and&#13;
2/&#13;
in the urban areas is likely to be very constrained-/ Policies&#13;
geared to improve the economic growth of a country are therefore&#13;
important elemerLs of an employment strategy, whether the&#13;
concern is with rural or urban employment.&#13;
However, macro-economic policies are clearly not enough&#13;
to solve the general employment problem of LDCs, nor specifically&#13;
the problems encountered in the absorption of urban labor supply.&#13;
1/ See Webb and Pfefferman (1978) for Brazil. Other countries, where&#13;
according to World Bank economists the employment issue is less&#13;
pressing mainly because of rapid aggregate economic growth, are&#13;
Iran, Algeria, Syria and Nigeria.&#13;
2/ See Cohen (1978),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -&#13;
Furthermore, while economic growth is to some extent a matter of&#13;
overall macro-economic policies, there can be no question that&#13;
the structure of the economy, especially as regards the elements&#13;
of labor demand and supply and the efficiency of the labor&#13;
markets, plays a significant role in determining the economic&#13;
growth performance of a country, particularly in the long term.&#13;
The compositionI of the labor supply and its determinants were&#13;
discussed above. The composition of labor demand and the&#13;
efficiency of the labor market will be discussed in the remainder&#13;
of this section.&#13;
b.  The Growth of Industrial, Service and Government Activities&#13;
The demand for urban labor is generated by those activities&#13;
which take place within urban areas, especially those of industry,&#13;
services, and the government sector. It is universally&#13;
observed that economic development (defined in terms of rising&#13;
per capita incomes), urbanization, and the growing importance&#13;
of industry, services, and government in total output, go hand&#13;
in hand.-/ Policies designed to generate a rapid and sustainable&#13;
growth in these activities will therefore also lead to a rapid&#13;
growth in the demand for urban labor. Trade protection, exchange-&#13;
rate and tax policies, public invrestment strategies, and credit&#13;
policies all have been used in various combinations in LDCs&#13;
to speed up the transformation from predominantly agricultural&#13;
to predominantly industrial. economies supported by large service&#13;
and government sectors. Whether import-substitution or export-&#13;
promotion oriented, the basic result has been an accelerated&#13;
1/ See Renaud (1979) for evidence.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -&#13;
growth of the industrial, service, and government activities&#13;
and with this an increased demand for urban labor.&#13;
Evidently, however, this set of policies has not "solved"&#13;
the urban employment problem, although it may have contributed&#13;
to an Improvement in the overall employment problem in some&#13;
countries. This is not the place to discuss the pros and cons&#13;
of rural versus urban development strategies in absorbing the&#13;
overall labor supply in the most efficient manner. Rather,&#13;
the three major reasons why rapid industrialization and urbani-&#13;
zation in most parts of the developing wvtld has not "solved"&#13;
the urban employment problem will briefly be reviewed.&#13;
First, there is the interaction of the labor demand side&#13;
with the labor supply side, particularly the rapid migration&#13;
flows from rural to urban areas in response to increased&#13;
demand for urban labor. Second, industrialization and the&#13;
related growth in the urban-based service and government sectors&#13;
does not equally affect all urban areas. The largest cities,&#13;
and especially the capital cities, tend to attract a larger&#13;
share of these activities than do the intermediate cities&#13;
and smaller towns, thus generating extensive increases in&#13;
labor demand in the former, but not to the same extent in the&#13;
latter. The differential, and, some would argue, unbalanced&#13;
pattern of industrialization has led to different sets of&#13;
employment problems in these two groups of urban areas, in&#13;
part because of the selectivity of the migration process which&#13;
was alluded to above in the discussion of the impact of migration&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -&#13;
on labor sup#ly. Third, and probably most importantly, in many&#13;
developing countries economic policies have fostered a pattern&#13;
of industrialization and urban development which appears to have&#13;
atunted the growth in demand for urban labor, especially the&#13;
demand for the unskilled types of labor, which are in relatively&#13;
abundant supply both in the urban and in the rural areas of LDCs.&#13;
These policies and their impacts are discussed next.&#13;
c. Choice of Technology, Scale of Enterprises, and Labor Intensity&#13;
Beier et al. (1975, p. 49) neatly summarize the problem&#13;
posed in urban labor absorption:&#13;
"The paradox of the import-substitution type of development&#13;
strategy is that while it discriminates severely against&#13;
the agricultural, sector and appears to be partly responsible&#13;
for the fast growth of large urban centers (together with&#13;
high population growth rates), it has led to excessive&#13;
patterns of dualism within the urban sector and has made&#13;
the absorption of the new urban dwellers more difficult,&#13;
not easier."&#13;
They go on to review the impacts on the urban labor market of&#13;
conventional policies regarding trade protection, exchange rate&#13;
over-valuation, and capital markets. A good case is made that&#13;
these policies have tended to&#13;
"result in capital-intensive projects with high capital&#13;
costs making heavy demands on foreign exchange and low&#13;
capacity to generate foreign exchange. They make heavy&#13;
demands on the real savings of the economy and do not&#13;
generate real savings." (Beier et al., p. 49/50).&#13;
By implication, the demand for labor, especially for lower-skill&#13;
1/&#13;
labor, languishes,-  thus preserving low wages and underemployment&#13;
1/ The demand for higher-skilled labor, to the extent that it is complementary&#13;
with capital, may, however, be fostered by these policies, and, given&#13;
the usual scarcety of the required skills in LDCs, this contributes&#13;
substantially to the high wages paid to high-grade labor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -&#13;
for the labor force in these low-skill grades.-/   Rather than&#13;
dwelling on these points which are discussed at length in Renaud&#13;
(1979) and Squire (1979), two additional considerations will be&#13;
given special attention here: first, the importance of the&#13;
small-scale enterprise sector, and the prevalence of government&#13;
policies hampering its development; and second, the degree of&#13;
technological choice in urban infrastructure investments and&#13;
its implications for the labor absorption capacity of urban&#13;
public works, given the overall amount of resources available&#13;
for such investments.&#13;
Small Scale Enterprise Development. The dust has not yet&#13;
settled as regards the debate on whether small-scale enterprises&#13;
(SSEs) in LDCs are on balance more labor intensive than larger-&#13;
scale firms. The recent World Bank Sector Policy Paper on&#13;
SSEs (World Bank, 1978a, p. 5) states unequivocally that SSEs&#13;
"are generally more labor-intensive than larger organizations."&#13;
However, another World Bank study dealing specifically with&#13;
urban development issues and policy in India states that:&#13;
"the assumption that on average small-scale industry uses&#13;
less capital than large-scale industry and promotes more&#13;
employment per unit of capital, is unproven. In a dynamic&#13;
sense, the record of small-scale firms in India also seems&#13;
to suggest that their potential for employment growth over&#13;
time is less good than large-scale firms, and their relative&#13;
important.e has declined despite. the protection and encourage-&#13;
ment given to them." (Waide, 1978, p. 7/8).&#13;
A further element of uncertainty is injected by the fact that,&#13;
as was argued earlier, the urban poor are not exclusively found&#13;
1/ Aside from the above-mentioned policies a number of other factors may&#13;
in part explain the capita&#143;. intensity of much of the industrial develop-&#13;
ment in LDCs: Maybe the mest important is the scarcity of management&#13;
skills, which tends to be highly compleTrentary with the development&#13;
of labor-intensive technologies. See also an exhaustive listing of&#13;
factors in World Bank (1978a), p. 16-17.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -&#13;
in SSE employment, and that a number of urban SSEs may pay&#13;
relatively high wages to their employees.-! Furthermore, as&#13;
Waide indicates (Waide, 1978, p. 8), especially in India there&#13;
are important linkages and complementarities between large-scale&#13;
',irms and SSEs, due to a prevailing practices of subcontracting.&#13;
Given this apparent lack of certainty regarding the impact&#13;
of an outright support of SSEs on urban employment and on urban&#13;
poverty, it would appear premature to advocate an across-the-board&#13;
policy favoring SSEs through government prpcurement policies,&#13;
industrial estates, subsidized capital allocations, and the like.&#13;
Two positive policy prescriptions relating to SSE developing&#13;
are, however, possible:  First, in the interest of increased&#13;
efficiency -- with possibly beneficial implications for urban&#13;
employment and poverty --, it is advisable to eliminate&#13;
the special burdens which are placed on SSEs in&#13;
comparison with larger scale operations. These include a whole&#13;
array of barriers, such as trade protection policies (especially&#13;
quantitative restrictions) favoring large-scale enterprises,-&#13;
credit rationing policies, public utility pricing,1 and local&#13;
l/ These are classified in World Bank (1978a, p. 18) as "small manufacturing&#13;
firms that are relatively modern," and "organized non-manufacturing firms,&#13;
such as those engaged in construction, repair transportation, and trading,"&#13;
in contrast to "enterprises not arganized or conducted in a. modernl manner,&#13;
e.g., traditional artisans, petty traders, and transporters in the&#13;
'informal' sector."&#13;
2/ See e.g., Keesing (1978).&#13;
3/ Especially the conventional, but usually inefficient declining block rates&#13;
for electricity are an area where improved public utility pricing would&#13;
eliminate an unnecessary burden on SSEs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 93 -&#13;
business and property tax policies./    The elimination of these&#13;
policies may provide as large an incentive to the efficient&#13;
development of SSEs in many lIveloping countries, as do the&#13;
explicit policies designed to foster SSEs.&#13;
The second positive policy prescriFtion relates to the&#13;
treatment of those SSEs which, following the description of the&#13;
World Bank SSE Sector Policy Paper (World Bank, 1978a, p. 18),&#13;
are "not organized or conducted in a 'modern' manner, e.g.&#13;
traditional artisans, petty traders, and transporters in the&#13;
'informal' sector." While not without exception, it is probably&#13;
true to say that these enterprises employ (or self-employ)&#13;
predominantly poor people and that they tend to be relatively&#13;
intensive in terms of low-skilled labor. Besides working&#13;
toward the elimination of frequently restrictive licensing&#13;
and taxing regulations (see the evidence cited above), direct&#13;
measures of support, such as providing access to capital,&#13;
at commercial interest rates, access to land and regularization of&#13;
land tenure,-/ provision of public utility services,3/ technical&#13;
assistance and informfal training, support of cooperatives for&#13;
obtaining cheaper access to higher quality inputs and for the&#13;
marketing of outputs.&#13;
1/ In Colombia the municipal industry and commerce tax frequently burdens&#13;
small enterprises much more heavily than larger ones (Linn, 1975).&#13;
Similar examples may be found elsewhere, for property and business&#13;
taxes alike (Bahl and Linn, forthcoming).&#13;
2/ This provides an incentive for developing smallest-scale enterprises&#13;
on residential premises; see for instance, Vernez (1973).&#13;
3/ Especially connection to the electricity network may stimulate&#13;
smallest-scale enterprise. Very often slum dwellers will risk&#13;
their lives to connect illegally (and highly unsafely) to power&#13;
lines, in order to be able to run small electric appliances,&#13;
such as sewing machines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 94 -&#13;
In tetms of the elimination of constraints, as well as&#13;
in the provision of outright support to these "informal"&#13;
SSE operations the local authorities in urban areas should be&#13;
encouraged to play a much more active role than they have&#13;
hitherto in most cities.- Local expertise and experience&#13;
is essential in determining the constraints on, as well as&#13;
the needs of, "informal" sector enterprises in LDC cities, and&#13;
often assistance to these enterprises can be provided in the&#13;
context of on-going local government programs (such as local&#13;
tax and administrative reform, public utility investment and&#13;
pricing, slum-improvement projects, and the like). This is&#13;
the kind of approach which appears to be evolving in the&#13;
World Bank's urban development projects,-/ and in other&#13;
3/&#13;
efforts at comprehensive urban poverty programs in various LDCs,-&#13;
although even these projects have at times bypassed the local&#13;
authorities and thus have missed important apportunities for&#13;
improvement.&#13;
As a caveat, however, it should be added that comprehensive&#13;
programs to assist the development of "informal" sector SSEs&#13;
require considerable investments in terms of project design&#13;
and management, as the experience of World Bank projects has&#13;
1/ This is in marked contrast to the cities of the People's Republic of&#13;
China, where the local authorities have played a major role in shaping&#13;
and assisting the development of all aspects of production,&#13;
(Andors, 1978).&#13;
2/ See for instance, World Bank (1978a), pp. 90-92.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 95 -&#13;
shown. Furthermore, while the cooperation of local authorities&#13;
may be essential in carrying out certain aspects of&#13;
these programs, local governments may not always be willing&#13;
or interested to do so, due to the political dominance and&#13;
opposition of entrenched interest groups. Finally, local&#13;
authorities are often viewed with distrust and suspicion by&#13;
slum dwellers and "informal" sector operators, because of&#13;
their history of obstructionist policies and practices, and&#13;
because of their functions as tax collectors. Nevertheless&#13;
it would be a mistake to neglect the many policies&#13;
of local governments which tend to affect the demand for the&#13;
labor services of the urban poor, although in some instances&#13;
it may be necessary to bypass these authorities in the actual&#13;
implementation of the programs.&#13;
Urban Public Infrastructure Investment. One of the most&#13;
salient features of urbanization is the large need for public&#13;
infrastructure investment, particularly for water supply,&#13;
waste disposal, road building, school construction and the&#13;
like. Moreover, all of the existing facilities need to be&#13;
operated and maintained, thus requiring considerable capital&#13;
and labor inputs. This naturally raises the question to what&#13;
extent the demand for unskilled urban labor could be boosted by&#13;
employing relatively labor intensive techniques for the construc-&#13;
tion, operation and maintenance of basic urban services. The&#13;
extent to which information on this question is available&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 96 -&#13;
appears to be quite limited, and what exists is not very clear&#13;
cut. A recent World Bank study of public works programs in LDCs&#13;
concluded that efforts to design and implement labor-intensive&#13;
public works projects in urban areas have not been successful&#13;
in the past, and are likely to be much more difficult to implement&#13;
in urban as compared with rural areas (Burki et al., 1976, pp. 17-19).&#13;
In a somewhat different vein, World Bank experience for the&#13;
developing countries of Europe, Middle East and North Africa&#13;
indicates that investment costs per job created are quite substan-&#13;
tial for water supply, sewerage, transport and non-residential&#13;
construction. For other LDCs, the evidence&#13;
on investment costs per job creation in these sectors seems&#13;
to be more favorable.&#13;
There can be little doubt that "make-work" urban public&#13;
works programs, such as "the Christmas Program"' in Kingston&#13;
(Jamaica) in some years past,-/ hold little prospect due to&#13;
low productivity and high budgetary cost. There are, however,&#13;
some areas of urban public service provision where labor&#13;
absorption can be significantly improved by a judicious choice&#13;
of labor-intensive technologies. Such a choice of technology&#13;
is often advisable also on other grounds, such as&#13;
reducing cost per service unit provided and thus increasing&#13;
the coverage of the urban population for given amounts of public&#13;
resources spent, or in the interest of conserving foreign exchange.&#13;
1/ This consisted mainly of street and sidewalk cleaning; see Burki&#13;
et al. (1976), p. 17.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 97 -&#13;
Nevertheless, the consideration of the employment impact of&#13;
alternative technologies in public service provision remains&#13;
useful.&#13;
Examples for extremely diverging technologies have been&#13;
documented for the collection and disposal of solid and sanitary&#13;
wastes. In the case of solid waste collection and disposal-=&#13;
local authorities are generally in charge, and particularly&#13;
in the larger cities they frequently are asked to replace&#13;
poorly managed conventional waste collection and disposal&#13;
techniques with modern techniques employed in the industrialized&#13;
countries-2/ The former relv heavily on labor-intensive methods&#13;
for picking and sorting in the recycling of usable solid wastes,&#13;
and for the collection of wastes from households by hand carts,&#13;
etc. The latter, in contrast, tend to rely on very capital-&#13;
and foreign-exchange intensive techniques for collection (compactor&#13;
trucks) and disposal (incinerators, composters,and the like),&#13;
and usually eliminate the possibility of recycling. In those&#13;
few countries and cities where a constructive approach to&#13;
improving and adapting conventional waste disposal techniques&#13;
3/&#13;
has been taken, both employment and labor earnings have increased.&#13;
1/ See Sfeir-Younis (1977) for a discussion of alternative technologies for this&#13;
service.&#13;
2/ More often than not the initiative rests with the manufacturers of the&#13;
modern equipment, who attempt to convince local officials of the desir-&#13;
ability of their techniques.&#13;
3/ In one city in Colombia a private development corporation organized trash&#13;
pickers into a self-managed profit-sharing enterprise for trash processing,&#13;
which quickly increased its employment from 15 to 60 men and raised daily&#13;
earnings from US$0.04 to $4.00 per day (U.S. Agency for International&#13;
Development, 1976, p. 64).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 98 --&#13;
In the case of sanitary waste disposal, a recent World Bank&#13;
study (Kalbermatten et al., 1978) has shown that there exist&#13;
various low cost alternatives to the very high-cost technology&#13;
of water-borne sanitary sewerage systems, which are commonly&#13;
found in industrialized countries and have been introduced in&#13;
many LDC cities, although usually on a very partial basis only,&#13;
due to budgetary constraints. While the labor intensity&#13;
of the alternative techniques was not explicitly investtgated&#13;
in this study there is little doubt, given the technological&#13;
difference in the nature of the investments required, that the&#13;
labor intensity of the low-cost alternatives of sewage disposal&#13;
is considerably above that of the water-borne sewerage system.&#13;
These are two extreme casts where the choice of technology&#13;
can have a considerable impact on the labor-intensity of urban&#13;
public service investments. In other areas, the scope for&#13;
increasing labor intensity through an appropriate choice&#13;
of technalogy may be less. However, it shou24 be made&#13;
explicitly a criterion in determining the design of urban&#13;
infrastructure projects. This may in some cases require research&#13;
into the alternatives available across countries -- as in the&#13;
case of the World Bank study on sanitary waste disposal&#13;
technology --? or it may merely mean a systematic evaluation&#13;
of alternatives available in a particular country and city,&#13;
using at the project level the well-known techniques of&#13;
economic analysis of projects (requiring especially shadow&#13;
pricing for unskilled-labor and of foreign exchange),- or,&#13;
1/ See for instance, Squire and van der Tak (1975),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 99&#13;
at the sectoral or inter-sectoral level, drawing on such&#13;
techniques as linear programming."&#13;
In summary, there may be considerable scope for increasing&#13;
the demand for low-skilled urban labor by policies which&#13;
encourage, rather than discourage, appropriate choice of&#13;
technology and scale of operations both in private and public&#13;
investment. As throughout this paper, emphasis was here put&#13;
on actions which may be taken at the sectoral, city or even&#13;
project level, since these are considerations which often&#13;
get only minimal attent'lon in the discussion of urban employment&#13;
and labor markets.&#13;
a. City Growth&#13;
Perhaps one of the most interesting questions which one&#13;
may raise as an observer of urban development in LDCs&#13;
is why some cities in a particular country appear to be growing&#13;
rapidly and doing relatively well in absorbing the growing&#13;
urban labor supply, while other cities within the same country&#13;
are doing very poorly, especially in terms of labor absorption.&#13;
As was indicated earlier, city size may be a relevant aspect&#13;
in explaining such differentials, but size is not the only&#13;
factor, since some of the strongest contrasts may be observed&#13;
between cit*es of comparable size. Calcutta and Bombay are&#13;
/ For an experimental application of linear programming in the design&#13;
of a public service investment strategy across cities and a number of&#13;
public service sectors, making allowance for alternative techno-&#13;
logies, see Thoss and Linn (1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 100 -&#13;
such a contrasting pair of cities in India; Barranquilla and&#13;
if&#13;
Medellin form another in Colombia.&#13;
The reasons for these div:rging growth and labor absorption&#13;
patterns between cities obviously differ from country to country&#13;
and from city to city. And for the most part they are likely&#13;
to be beyond the control of local authorities within a city.&#13;
For instance, Calcutta has been hurt by various exogenous&#13;
developments': It was cut off from large parts of its natural&#13;
hinterland by changes in national boundaries, it suffered&#13;
from national transportation price policies which undermined&#13;
the locational advantage which it could offer new investments&#13;
in the past, and it was bypassed to a certain extent in national&#13;
plan allocations of national public investments (Wallich, 1978).&#13;
These and other exogenous factors seriously impeded industrial&#13;
growth in the city during recent years, while migratory flows&#13;
2/&#13;
to the city continued-  because of push factors in the rural&#13;
hinterland and because of the political upheavals in neighboring&#13;
Bangladesh, formerly East Pakistan. Bombay in contrast did not&#13;

for intermediate-size cities, e.g., Buenaventura and Bucaramanga&#13;
(Linn, 1978a).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 101 -&#13;
have to contend with any of these exogenous depressing factors&#13;
and has acted as a pole of attraction for new investment and&#13;
job creation, which -- at least in relative terms -- made it&#13;
an example of successful urban labor absorption in India.&#13;
More generally, one may conclude that regional economic endow-&#13;
ments and growth, nationr!'. public investment patterns, and&#13;
changes in the transportation network are among the more&#13;
important exogenous factors explaining the differences in&#13;
economic growth and labor absorption of different cities of&#13;
similar size within the same country (Renaud, 1979).&#13;
Besides these exogenous factors there are, however, also&#13;
important determinants of urban growth and labor absorption&#13;
endogenous to a particular city. In particular the quality&#13;
of management by the urban authorities may have an important&#13;
impact on whether and how a city g-ows. Besides the fact that&#13;
urban government can influence the labor intensity of public&#13;
and private activities as was discussed in the preceding&#13;
section, it can help or hinder the growth prospects of a city&#13;
in the aggregate and thus boost or dampen the growth of labor&#13;
demand within the metropolitan area. Among the elements&#13;
entering here are the provision of adequate public utilities&#13;
for industry and commerce; the existence of a well-functioning&#13;
urban transport system which permits the speedy distribution&#13;
of goods and services, thus saving time and cost; availability&#13;
of developed land for new industrial developments; adequate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 102 -&#13;
public marketing facilities both for wholesale and retail&#13;
purposes; a good communications system through telephones and&#13;
postal services; a public administration which minimizes&#13;
efficiency losses and compliance costs for regulations and&#13;
taxes.l/ While the exact quantitative impact of any one of&#13;
these elements of urban management on urban growth and employment&#13;
absorbtion is very difficult to ascertain, there can be little&#13;
doubt that the failure of urban management in the past in such&#13;
cities as Calcutta or Barranquilla has contributed considerably&#13;
to the poor performance of these cities, when compared which&#13;
the much better performance of Bombay or Medellin, where urban&#13;
management has been of much higher quality. A comprehensive&#13;
approach to improving urban management across the board may&#13;
therefore be required in many LDC cities in order to increase&#13;
their absorptive capacity. Control of central city congestion&#13;
as in Singapore (Watson and Holland, 1978), improved public&#13;
utility services and road infrastructure at cosF-covering charges,-/&#13;
1/ A particularly drastic example for high efficiency costs of urban&#13;
taxation is the so-called "octroi" tax frequently found in the cities&#13;
of the Indian subcontinent. This tax is levied on all goods entering&#13;
a local jurisdiction just like an import tariff is levied at national&#13;
boundaries. In some cities, such as Karachi, where more than one local&#13;
government has jurisdiction over the metropolitan area, octroi taxes&#13;
are levied even on goods traffic within the metropolitan area&#13;
(Bahl and Linn, forthcoming).&#13;
2/ Note the important contribution which the urbarn transport improvements&#13;
under the so-called "valorization" schemes in Colombia have made to the&#13;
urban development of Bogota, Medellin, and Cali (Doebele, Grimes,&#13;
and Linn, 1979).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 103 -&#13;
a streamlined administration of local taxes and regulations,&#13;
and provision of a wide variety of marketing facilities are&#13;
all within the purview of urban management and do not in&#13;
general require higher-level government intervention, unless,&#13;
as is too often the case, constraints by higher level govern-&#13;
ments on local revenue and expenditure authority limit the&#13;
local freedom of action.&#13;
While the general area of urban administration,&#13;
management and finances is not addressed here,&#13;
three aspects need to be emphasized: First, the location of&#13;
public facilities, such as industrial parks, public markets,&#13;
transport terminals, and tV i like is of utmost importance in&#13;
urban areas since, as many examples have shown in the past,&#13;
poor location may well result in substantial under-ttilization&#13;
of these facilities while bottlenecks are generated elsewhere.-/&#13;
Second, in attempting to improve urban management and adminis-&#13;
tration it is important to bear in mind not only the economic&#13;
interests and needs of the modern sector activities. If one&#13;
of the prime objectives of urban employment policy is to improve&#13;
the absorption of low-skilled labor, then urban management must&#13;
be geared also to pruvide the complementary public services&#13;
required by activities using such labor, and to adjust. its&#13;
regulatory and taxing practices so as to minimize the compliance&#13;
cost for the "informal" sector. Earlier sections have indicated&#13;
many areas where improvements are feasible. Third, attempts&#13;
1/ See for instance the impact of poor location of new public markets in&#13;
Cartagena (Linn, 1975).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 104 -&#13;
to attract new investment to a particular city by offering&#13;
local tax holidays is not a good way of increasing employment&#13;
in the city for a number of reasons: The impact of such action&#13;
on private investment decisions is not likely to be significant,&#13;
especially where off-setting actions are taken by other cities,&#13;
as for instance in Colombia (Bahl and Linn, forthcoming); indeed&#13;
by making capital cheap it may increase capital intensity thus&#13;
reducing labor absorption; finally, there is the obvious burden&#13;
on local finances, which are usually in poor shape anyway.&#13;
However, one should be under no illusion:    Improvements&#13;
in urban management, administration, and finance are not easy,&#13;
particularly in an environment where due to exogenous factors&#13;
and past mismanagement the urban absorptive capacity is low,&#13;
as e.g., in Calcutta and Barranquilla. Nevertheless, improved&#13;
urban management must be one of the ingredients of a program&#13;
aimed at increasing the ability of cities to absorb their&#13;
abundant labor supply.&#13;
3. The Functioning of the Urban Labor Market: Market Imperfections and&#13;
Transactions Costs&#13;
So far it was implicitly assumed that the labor market&#13;
works well in matching demands and supplies at market clearing prices&#13;
for all skill categories and for all types of activities. Market imperfec-&#13;
tions were discussed only in markets other than the labor market.&#13;
For instance, governmental controls on street hawker activities in central&#13;
cities represent a limitation on the location decisions regarding street&#13;
hawking activities and thus are an imperfection in the land market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
105 -&#13;
Failure to price urban transportation correctly leads to congestion and&#13;
(among other things) to increased transactions costs for the commodity&#13;
markets due to the inefficiency in the transportation system. Other&#13;
examples could be cited. In each case removal of imperfections in markets&#13;
other than the labor markets was analyzed as a&amp;possible means to increase&#13;
the demand for labor, particularly among the lower skill categories.&#13;
This section briefly discusses market imperfections operating specifically&#13;
in the urban labor market and what policy steps may be taken to reduce&#13;
these.&#13;
As a first step it is necessary to ask what evidence there is&#13;
regarding the existence of labor market imperfections. Some recent&#13;
studies of urban labor earnings in LDCs have found that the standard&#13;
human capital variables, such as ag'a, education, experience, sex, etc.&#13;
fail to account fully for earnings differentials between different labor&#13;
market segments.-   Labor market imperfections may account for some of the&#13;
unexplained variance in earnings. Institutional practices such as minimum&#13;
wage legislation, public employment restrictions, educational require-&#13;
ments unrelated to productivity criteria., ethnic and caste barriers to&#13;
job access,and labor registration requirements have frequently been&#13;
documented.2/ Other elements of labor market imperfection which have,&#13;
perhaps, not received as much attention relate to the lack of adequate&#13;
information transmission 3/ and, more importantly, to commuting costs&#13;
1/ Mazumdar (1978), Mazumdar and Ahmed (1978), Snyderman (1978), and&#13;
Sant' Anna (1976).&#13;
2/ See for instance, Cohen (1978), Peattie (1974), Waide (1978), Webb&#13;
and Pfeffermann (1978) to cite but a few.&#13;
3/ Although one must add that the information system is probably better&#13;
among the low-skill and low-income strata than one might suspect.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 106 -&#13;
(both in terms of time and money costs) which essentially act as a form of&#13;
transactions costs in the labor market.A/&#13;
The importance of these transactions costs in terms of&#13;
employment and earnings reduction, while difficult to assess on a global&#13;
basis, is vividly demonstrated by the extreme political sensitivity of&#13;
increases in urban public transit fares,-/ and by the&#13;
impact on the employment patterns of low income households who are&#13;
relocated from relatively convenient central locations to peripheral&#13;
locations requiring time consuming and costly commuting trips to the&#13;
piace of work.-2/ The management of urban land use and of the urban&#13;
transportation system should therefore be geared to reduce these&#13;
transactions costs to the extent feasible. One way is to permit or&#13;
even encourage industrial and residential land use patterns which&#13;
minimize the length of work trips,-/ rather than separating industrial&#13;
1/ Another example of unneesssartly elevated transactions costs, which limit&#13;
labor mobility within a city, occurs where rent control is prevalent.&#13;
Because of resulting housing shortages and the widespread requirement of&#13;
cash payments ("key money") at the beginning of a lease, many renters may be&#13;
locked into existing rental arrangements. See e.g., Waide (1978), p. 5.&#13;
2/ General strikes, street riots, and the like are not a rarity in response&#13;
to transit fare increases in many LDC cities, while the increases in the&#13;
charges for other urban services are generally received with less hostility.&#13;
3/ See e.g., ?erlman (1976) for Rio de Janeiro.&#13;
4/ The Colombian efforts at developing multi-nodal city design through&#13;
a multi-functional "ecities-within-the-city" program is an&#13;
interesting effo;rt in,this direction.. The reduced importa.nce of the&#13;
railroad and the increased use of trucks in inter-city goods trans-&#13;
portation may well encourage a spontaneous decentralization of&#13;
intra-urban industrial location, away from the conventional location&#13;
bunched along railway terminals to areas where land is cheaper and labor&#13;
more readily available. There is some evidence that this is already&#13;
happening in Bogota (Lee, 1978). Rigid enforcement of out-dated&#13;
zoning regulations might well impede this development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
107 -&#13;
ad residential areas by rigid zoning regulations or poorly located&#13;
investments in infrastructure or industrial parks. Especially for those&#13;
cities which are still relatively small but are growing rapidly -- as&#13;
is the case for many cities in Africa, and for some of the intermediate-&#13;
size cities in other L)DCs-- there may be considerable gains reaped&#13;
from land use planning, since the physical structure of these&#13;
cities still permits a considerable degree of flexibility, whtch is&#13;
largely absent in the big metropoles. Other elements of a policy&#13;
reducing the transactions costs are the control of central city&#13;
costtion through appropriate charges geared especially to limit&#13;
the use of private automobiles 'as in Singapore (Watson and Holland, 1978),&#13;
and the provision of a good system of arterial and neighborhood access&#13;
roads, supplemented by an effective public transit system.&#13;
Again, in designing these measures it is crucial to bear in&#13;
mind that it is the low-skill and low-income categories which are&#13;
hardest hit by the transactions costs resulting from poor land use and&#13;
transportation policies. A common bias, for example, is to improve city roads&#13;
to keep up with rapidly increasing private automobile traffic, while not&#13;
providing pedestrian or bicycle paths or crossings, nor making city&#13;
roads more passable for busses, nor providing for adequate neighborhood&#13;
access roads in poor areas, More will be said&#13;
about these and related policies in later chapters; the main point&#13;
to be made here is that urban miancgement and planning are crucial to&#13;
the working of the urban labor market.&#13;

D. Summary of Policy Implications&#13;
At this point it is convenient to pull together the major&#13;
policy implications of this chapter's discussion of urban employment&#13;
and labor markets. The fact that this paper has focused on policy&#13;
actions at the city of project level should not lead one to overlook&#13;
that some of the most important policy instruments for employment&#13;
creation and improved productivity in the urban sector are held&#13;
by the natinnal government (trade protection, capital market policies,&#13;
national public investment and taxation, education and health&#13;
policies, etc.). Nevertheless city and project specific instruments&#13;
are of relevence for the three following reasons.&#13;
First, local urban authorities and specific projects very&#13;
often play an important role in the implementation of national-level&#13;
policies.&#13;
Second, since there are a number of actions taken at the city&#13;
level which interfere with employment generation and productivity increases,&#13;
and others could be taken to foster employment and productivity, there is&#13;
good reason to deal with these actions. If progress is to be made in solving&#13;
the urban poverty problem in general, and the employment problem in&#13;
particular, action must be taken on all possible fronts to the greatest&#13;
extent. This implies that concerted action is necessary at the national&#13;
and city level, regarding labor demand, labor supply and labor market&#13;
imperfections, in terms of general, and in terms of urban-poverty oriented&#13;
employment policies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 109 -&#13;
Third, it is just as important to be aware of what city- and&#13;
project-specific policies cannot do, as it is to consider what they can do.&#13;
Misp2laced priorities on employment or productivity generation at the&#13;
city-level, in a context where the general environment is not favorable,&#13;
is just as wasteful of resources as it is to neglect opportunities for&#13;
improving employment and productivity where this is feasible, particularly&#13;
in the context of programs that are already ongoing, e.g. reform of urban&#13;
management, taxation and administration, public service investment programs, etc.&#13;
In conclusion, a list of "do's" and "don'ts" for decisions&#13;
commonly taken at the city or project level may be a useful way of demon-&#13;
strating the last point, while at the same time summarizing the major&#13;
policy implications of this chapter. For the sake of clarity these points&#13;
are organized around a few major headings, but inevitably there is some&#13;
overlap between headings, with the result that some prescriptions appear&#13;
under more than one heading and some might be placed also under additional&#13;
headings. Furthermore, no claim is made here that the listing is all&#13;
inclusive, although probably the major aspects of city or project level policy&#13;
are captured. In any case, many of the prescriptions will need to be&#13;
refined in the context of the more detailed analysis of urban service&#13;
provision and urban management in the following chapters.&#13;
1. Administration, Regulation, and Taxation&#13;
Do - minimize unfavorable and discriminating constraints in public&#13;
administration, regulation, and taxation, which inhibit the&#13;
operations of SSEs, in patticular those in the "informal" sector;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 110 -&#13;
- minimize private compliance costs of public administration,&#13;
regulation and taxation by reducing red tape and waiting&#13;
time for public permits and tax payment procedures;&#13;
- eliminate unnecessary restrictions in local public hiring&#13;
practices which are unrelated to productivity considerations,&#13;
but at the same time adopt wage policies for local authorities&#13;
which will attract adequately skilled personnel.-&#13;
Do not  - define "informal" sector activities as negative, unproductive,&#13;
or undesirable, and on this basis attempt to control them by&#13;
such policies as slum eradication, restrictions on "informal"&#13;
sector activities, etc.&#13;
-  employ "beggar-thy-neighbor" policies to attract private&#13;
investors (especially from the "modern" sector) by improving&#13;
the aesthetics of city through "informal" sector elimination,&#13;
or by offering local tax holidays to investors; in order to&#13;
ensure general application of this principle national legis-&#13;
lation may be required to eliminate jurisdictional competition.&#13;
2. Public Service Investment&#13;
Do - search for labor intensive techniques in providing urban&#13;
public services; this may require research and evaluation of&#13;
alternative technologies at the sectoral, national, or even&#13;
international level;&#13;
1/ This last point applies especially in the smaller and non-capital cities&#13;
which have difficulty attracting well-trained local government personnel.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- carefully consider the location of urban infrastructure&#13;
investments in terms of&#13;
a) minimizing the length and costs of commuting trips;&#13;
b) facilitating goods transportation, marketing, etc.;&#13;
c) providing the poor with access to service facilities,&#13;
including schools, hospitals, health and family planning&#13;
centers, etc.;&#13;
- emphasize investments in distribution networks of public&#13;
utilities, especially electricity, as a way to encourage SSE&#13;
development.&#13;
Do not - attempt to minimize rural-urban migration by withholding&#13;
public services from urban slums;&#13;
- expect that "make-work" urban public works programs will&#13;
provide a solution to the urban employment and poverty&#13;
problem;&#13;
- replace conventional labor intensive public service technologies&#13;
by modern capital and foreign exchange intensive techniques&#13;
without careful sectoral and project-level analysis,&#13;
including the shadow-pricing of labor and of foreign&#13;
exchange.&#13;
3. Public Service Pricing&#13;
Do - set urban service prices equal to the incremental cost of&#13;
providing the services, except where external benefits from&#13;
service provision are clearly substantial or where u'life-line'"i/&#13;
tariffs to poor consumers can be applied;&#13;
1/ These are tariffs which are very low for small initial blocks of service&#13;
consumption, but are set equal to cost of service provision for consump-&#13;
tion levels beyond essential, life-supporting levels (see Chapter VI below).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 112 -&#13;
- introduce congestion charges for central city road use by&#13;
private automobiles;&#13;
- structure service prices for the poor so as to maximize&#13;
their ability to connect to the services; in particular,&#13;
consider the introduction of "life-line" services and the&#13;
replacement of lumpsum connection fees by recurrent charges.&#13;
Do not - discriminate against small public utility users, unless&#13;
the incremental cost of supplying them are clearly higher&#13;
than for large users; in particular this applies to the usually&#13;
inefficient practice of dharging declining block rates for&#13;
electricity;&#13;
- fail to introduce "life-line" service rates for poor urban&#13;
residents on the grounds that this would induce rural-urban&#13;
migration.&#13;
4. Education, Health, Nutrition, and Population Planning&#13;
Do  -  consider the potential contribution of urban local authorities&#13;
to education, health, nugrition and population planning&#13;
programs;&#13;
- emphasize informal education, training and technical&#13;
assistance for "informal" sector SSEs;&#13;
- locate the physical facilities for these services so as to&#13;
maximize access by the poor.&#13;
Do not  -  over-invest in education where the productivtty&#13;
of such investment is low, as indicated for instance by&#13;
low social rates of return to education;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
113 -&#13;
this applies especially to formal primary school education&#13;
in Latin America, and to liberal-arts-type secondary&#13;
education in many other countries.&#13;
5. Small Scale Enterprises&#13;
Do - focus on "informal" sector activities in any attempts to&#13;
stimulate SSE activities, since they are most likely to be&#13;
harmed by discriminatory public action, lack of access to&#13;
capital, inputs, and markets;&#13;
-  consider the potential of local authorities in assisting&#13;
the provision of training9 extension services, cooperative&#13;
development, etc. for SSEs;&#13;
-  induce local authorities to consider the needs of SSEs in&#13;
urban service provision, particularly as regards extension of&#13;
electricity services, location of public markets, and&#13;
improvements in land tenure security in slum areas.&#13;
Do not -  discriminate against SSEs, especially those in the "informal"&#13;
sector, through regulation, taxation, and administrative&#13;
practices, in particular by local authorities;&#13;
- expect to solve the urban employment problem by SSE&#13;
programs alone.&#13;
6. Land Market&#13;
Do - inmprove land tenure security in slum and squatter areas,&#13;
since this will stimulate investment in "informal" sector&#13;
SSE activities direactly, as well as indirectly by improving&#13;
access to capital through enabling property owners to offer&#13;
collateral to lenders;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 114 -&#13;
- act to supply adequate urban space for urban poor at&#13;
reasonable locations so that they can carry out SSE&#13;
activities in their homes.&#13;
Do not - prevent efficient residential and/or industrial location&#13;
decisions by inappropriate zoning regulations;&#13;
- prevent access of "informal" SSE operators to favorable&#13;
locations;&#13;
- introduce rent control, since this will impede labor&#13;
mobility within the city, in addition to reducing investment&#13;
in housing.&#13;
7. Migration&#13;
Do - price urban services at incremental social cost, including the use&#13;
of central city road space, since this means that private&#13;
investors in particular will be forced to consider the full&#13;
social cost of their location decisions as between different&#13;
cities, and as between different locations within a city;&#13;
Do not - attempt to control migration by withholding urban services&#13;
from slums and squatter areas, by not applying "life-line"&#13;
service rates, or by restrictions on "informal" sector&#13;
activities.&#13;

IV. REDISTRIBUTION OF URBAN INCOMES THROUGH FISCAL POLICY&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
The preceding chapter discussed possible policy actions to deal&#13;
with the problem of urban poverty through increases in labor income in response&#13;
to increased employment and productivity. While various of the proposed&#13;
policy actions hold prospects of raising the incomes of the poor,&#13;
these gains are likely to be slow, thus leading to substantial improvements&#13;
only over longer periods of time, possibly only over generations. The&#13;
question must therefore be asked whether there exist any shortcuts&#13;
which might produce quicker results in eliminating at least the worst mani-&#13;
festations of urban poverty, and in partl- : lar raise a large number, if not&#13;
all of the absolute poor in urban areas Across the threshold of absolute&#13;
poverty.&#13;
The most obvious alternative to a slaw process of raising the labor&#13;
incomes of the urban poor is to redistribute to them through public action&#13;
incomes earned by high-paid labor or by other assets, such as capital and&#13;
land. The purpose of the present chapter is to evalutate the potential of&#13;
public action in achieving income redistribution in urban areas. In doing so,&#13;
the assumption will be made that urban poverty eradication cannot expect to&#13;
draw on net resource transfers from rural to urban alreas. Almost without&#13;
exception, average urban incomes are higher than ruraLl incomes, the number&#13;
and proportion of absolute poor tends to be smaller in urban than in rural&#13;
areas, and public policy, if anything, has tended to draw resources away&#13;
from rural and into urban areas in many LDCs. These conditions set up a prima&#13;
llacie case for redistribution in favor of rural, ratlher than urban&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 116-&#13;
11&#13;
areas.   Redistribution for urban poverty alleviation will thus have to&#13;
2i&#13;
draw essentially on the incomes generated in urban areas themselves.&#13;
The remainder of this chapter is organized in three sections: The&#13;
first briefly discusses the scope for general income redistributiort, while&#13;
the second centers more extensively on the issue which is the main focus&#13;
of this paper, namely how urban p%sverty, and in particular absolute urban&#13;
poverty, may be reduced by public policy. The last section summarizes&#13;
the chapter's major policy implications.&#13;
B. The Scope for General Income Redistribution&#13;
The objective which is frequently, if only implicitly, set for&#13;
redistributive policy in popular as well as academic discussions of income&#13;
inequality in LDCs, is that the distribution of income be shifted on the whole&#13;
towards greater equality. For instance, changes in the Gini coefficient or&#13;
shifts in the Lorenz curve are common measures of the effectiveness of public&#13;
tax and expenditure policies in terms of increasing equity. Measured in these&#13;
1/ For a recent general study supporting this view, see Lipton (1977); see also&#13;
Cohen (1978), who states (p.2): "In the Sahel, this turbaAx7 bias is found&#13;
in the subsidized prices of food, agricultural pricing policies, the alloca-&#13;
tion of public infrastructure and social services, and individual investment&#13;
decisions in almost every sector." It needs, however, to be emphasized that;&#13;
while these and other studies present extensive evidence supporting the&#13;
claim of an urban policy bias in many LDCs, an unequivocal&#13;
proof of this proposition is out of the question. The analytical and&#13;
empirical difficulties encountered in budget incidence studies (for an&#13;
excellent review of such studies and their pitfalls, see de Wulf, 1975),&#13;
apply with equal fcrce to studies purporting to prove urban policy biases.&#13;
2/  This does not imply, however, that there should be no financial transfprr&#13;
from national (or state) governments to local governments in urban areas.&#13;
A good portion of national government tax revenues are generated in&#13;
urban areas, and some of this may have to be transferred back to urban&#13;
governments, if these do not have sufficient authority to raise revenues&#13;
locally rommensurate with their expenditure responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 117 -&#13;
terms, redistribution through public policies has not, on the available&#13;
evidence, been carried very far in most LDCs.&#13;
A recent survey of studies of tax incidence, i.e. of the distribu-&#13;
tion of the tax burden across income classes, found that out of 32 studies&#13;
22 show some progressivity in taxation, eight show approximately proportional,&#13;
or neutral, tax rates--these are mainly Latin American countries-while feor&#13;
two countries (Greece and the Philippines) the incidence of taxes was estimated&#13;
to be regressive (de Wulf, 1975). As the author of this survey points out&#13;
(p. 71), this result is perhaps somewhat more positive than might have been&#13;
expected, given the generally gloomy evaluation by critics of tax systems in&#13;
LDGs.  Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that in most countries the tax&#13;
1/&#13;
system does little to alter seriously the distribution of income.&#13;
Serious estimation problems are encountered in the analysis of tax&#13;
incidence, mainly because it is difficult to know who bears the final burden&#13;
of a tax, once it is recognized that the shifting of tax burdens through factor&#13;
and commodity price adjustments from the initial tax payer to others is not&#13;
only possible, but in fact quite likely for many taxes (Bird and de Wulf, 1973;&#13;
deWulf , 1975; McLure, 1975). Nevertheless, these problems appear minor when&#13;
compared to the difficulties of establishing the incidence of government&#13;
expenditures.  The measurement of the benefits of government spending, as well&#13;
as the distribution of these benefits as they are shifted from initial recipient&#13;
to final beneficiary is a very difficult area of economic analysis espiecially&#13;
1/   McLure (1975), for instance, finds for a subsample of tax incidence&#13;
studies that much of the progressivity is explained by two factors:&#13;
higher effective rates in urban, as compared with rural areas, and rela-&#13;
tively very heavy effective tax rates on the richest 2 to 5 percent of&#13;
urban housheholds. For the rest, taxes are more or less proportional even&#13;
in countries where the overall incidence is quite progressive.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 118 -&#13;
when a wide range of government expenditures is subjected to analysis (de Wulf,&#13;
1975). One therefore has to proceed with extreme caution in interpreting the&#13;
results of goverment expenditure incidence studies, which on balance appear&#13;
to indicate that the distribution of income is improved by government expen-&#13;
ditures.&#13;
Combining tax and expenditure incidence studies, one is led to&#13;
conclude that govermnent budgets in LDCs, have on balance tended to&#13;
improve the distribution of incomes in LDCs in general, and in the urban areas&#13;
of LDCs in particular, but that their impact has remained slight as measured&#13;
against the existing inequalities in incomes.l/&#13;
It is not difficult to determine the reasons for the limited impact&#13;
which government budgets have had on the distribution of incomes in LDCs.&#13;
First and forumost, there is the political obstacle: The wealthy tend to&#13;
dominate the political arena, and obviously they have no interest in a&#13;
large-scale redistribution through the public sector.&#13;
A second, and related point ia -one of perception of inequality, which is&#13;
2/&#13;
very well stated by Bird and de Wulf (1973, pp. 676-677):&#13;
"A serious problem-with the more intensive use of the tax&#13;
system for redistributive purposes is that, while income in&#13;
Latin America is so unequally distributed that there are,&#13;
by anyone's standards, a great many poor people, there are&#13;
1/ A very thorough study of budget incidence for Malaysia, a country which&#13;
has probably made greater efforts at redistribution through the government&#13;
budget than many other LDCs, shows that while the incomes of the poorest&#13;
income decile are raised by about 50 percent and those of the richest&#13;
five percent drop by hine percent as a result of government taxation and&#13;
expenditure, the incomes of the latter group remain some eighteen times as&#13;
large as those of the former group (Meerman, 1977, p. 46).&#13;
2/  The same point is made by Harberger (1977), p.263.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
119 -&#13;
only a small number of rich people by relative national&#13;
standards. This is not a mere play on words. The point&#13;
is that the average incomes and consumption standards of&#13;
those at the top of the Latin American pyramid, while much&#13;
higher than tDose at the bottom, are in general only roughly&#13;
equivalent to the average levels prevailing in the developed&#13;
couintries. There are, of couirse, some wealthy people in&#13;
most countries, but it seems nevertheless true that most of&#13;
the relatively rich in Latin America appear to consider&#13;
themselves to be middle class, the middle class to be poor,&#13;
and the poor to be virtually non-existent. The cosmopolitan&#13;
perspective from which professionals and other members of&#13;
this upper-income group tend to view their relative position&#13;
in the world is at least a partial explanation for the&#13;
apparently widespread existence of this truncated perception&#13;
of the national distribution of the good things of life.&#13;
Combined with the political dominance of the (relatively)&#13;
well-to-do in Latin America, this fact is perhaps more than&#13;
sufficient to explain why few efforts, and even less success,&#13;
to redistribute income and wealth through the fiscal system&#13;
may be noted in most countries."&#13;
Third, any serious effort to tax incomes very progressively faces&#13;
three major ways of attempted escape from the progressive tax bite: Flight of&#13;
capital and highly-skilled labor from the country; evasion of taxes by&#13;
subterfuge; and reduction in work r1fort. The importance of these avenues of&#13;
escape, and the degree to which they can be closed will vary from country to&#13;
1/&#13;
country, but they certainly limit the progressivity of the tax system.&#13;
Finally, to demonstrate the difficulties of achieving the goals of&#13;
significantly increased equality in LDC through government taxes and expendi-&#13;
tures, when these are superimposed on a highly skewed distribution of income,&#13;
Table IV-1 reports on a hypothetical exercise carried out by Harberger (1977)&#13;
to demonstrate the limited redistributive potential of government budget.&#13;
Starting with a "typical" distributfon of income found in LDCs (Gini coefficient:&#13;
0.498), he superimposes combinations of alternative hypothetical tax and&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 120 -&#13;
and expenditure policies to determine   their distributional impact. The .t- -&#13;
is that even under the most extreme hypotheses, i.e. a highly progressive&#13;
1/&#13;
tax and an egalitarian expenditure policy,    the Gini coefficient is only&#13;
improved to 0.419, i.e. still higher (i.e., indicating more inequality) than&#13;
the without-government Gini coefficient for the U.S. (0.402).&#13;

Other, more drastic measures at redistribution, in particular the&#13;
redistribution of asset ownership, tend to hold greater prospects in store&#13;
for redistribution of incomes, as the experience in socialist countries has&#13;
1/ I.e., taxes increase more than in proportion to income, but expenditures&#13;
are distributed equally across all households.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 121&#13;
shown. In rural areas land reform is frequently suggested as a way to share&#13;
the rent of land more equally, and to increase the employment&#13;
and productivity of rural labor. For urban areas, no ready equivalent&#13;
measure of asset redistribution appears to exist. The closest to it is probably&#13;
the de facto change in urban land ownership through land invasion, which has&#13;
taken place particularly in Latin American cities. However, it can hardly&#13;
be said that these ownership transfers represented instruments of government&#13;
policy in most cities, and in any case there are no estimates available regard-&#13;
ing the impact of urban land invasions on the distribution of urban incomes,&#13;
1/&#13;
although the direction of the change is quite unequivocal.     Othei examples&#13;
of asset ownership transfers may be found in the case of nationalization of&#13;
industries, transfer of enterprise ownership to worker management (Chile,&#13;
Yugoslavia), and total socialization of all productive assets, commonly&#13;
found in Centrally Planned Economies. The last two of these three approaches&#13;
appear to have reduced income inequality significantly, but the first has not&#13;
been as successful in achieving this goal. But what is even more important,&#13;
in and of themselves, none of these approaches deal with the problem of urban&#13;
poverty for two reasons:   Socialization of productive assets may   decrease&#13;
inequality by transferring the returns to these assets from the previous asset&#13;
owners (the very rich) to the public sector, which then may allocate these&#13;
funds in a number of ways, only one of which is to redress the problem of poverty.&#13;
And even if this focus is chosen, at least as one among others, there is no&#13;
guarantee that such a program actually affects the urban (rural) poor on a&#13;

chapter.&#13;

broad basis.  For instance, if urban service standards are set very high,&#13;
even a program explicitly geared to provide these services to the poor, will&#13;
1/&#13;
not result in a broad coverage, due to resource limitations.&#13;
The upshot of this discussion of income redistribution,&#13;
is that one needs to take the poverty focus quite explicitly as&#13;
the objective of analysis and policy, in order to ensure that studies&#13;
of government tax and expenditure incidence and related policies&#13;
address the question of how and to what extent urban poverty may be&#13;
eliminated by public policy. The fact that tax policies have not&#13;
significantly reduced, let along eliminated inequality, does not mean&#13;
that appropriately designed tax and expenditure policies cannot significantly&#13;
reduce poverty. And the fact that other policies (e.g., nationalization)&#13;
have reduced inequality does not necessarily imply that they have also&#13;
extensively reduced poverty. The next section will attempt to analyze&#13;
the potential of government taxation and expenditure in terms of the&#13;
policy goal of urban poverty alleviation.&#13;
1/ The importance of service standards will be taken up again in&#13;
greater detail in later chapters.&#13;

C.  The Scope f6t Urban-Povetty Alleviation&#13;
Through Fiscal Policy&#13;
By shifting the focus of redistribution policies away from the&#13;
objective of leveling the skewness in the income distribution to the&#13;
goal of poverty alleviation, the study of fiscal instruments, especially&#13;
taxation and public expenditure, is simplified and the constraints to&#13;
implementation are reduced. In essence, the argumenLt :s that it is&#13;
easier analytically and practically, to evaluate how changes in selected&#13;
taxes and public expenditures affect the welfare of a particular group,&#13;
namely those subsisting in absolute poverty, than it is to study the impact&#13;
1/&#13;
of all taxes and all public expenditures in all income groups; that it is&#13;
easier to get general political agreement on programs designed to eliminate&#13;
absolute poverty, than on a program of general redistribution, and that,&#13;
if the elimination of poverty is in fact accepted as an objective having&#13;
strong "ethical justification, an explicit focus on poverty elimination is&#13;
more likely to lead to policy prescriptions actually serving this goal,&#13;
than if one approaches the redistribution issue from the point of eliminating&#13;
inequality. Not surprisingly, therefore, the position taken in this section,&#13;
and indeed throughout the remainder of this paper, is closely related to,&#13;
and indeed draws on the arguments supporting the "basic needs"'approach to&#13;
development policy.&#13;
1/   This is not to say that difficulties of analysis do not remain.&#13;
2/   See for instance Streeten and Burki (1978) for a summary statement&#13;
regarding the "basic needs" approach. The present approach, however,&#13;
does not exclude the possibility that decision makers may want to pursue&#13;
a general goal of improving incomes for the poor, rather than merely&#13;
meeting selected needs defined as "basic".&#13;

The purpose in this section is not to develop global measures&#13;
of basic needs or of resources required to satisfy these needs or eliminate&#13;
absolute poverty, rather, the attempt is made, first to evaluate how&#13;
tax policy can be adapted to reduce the tax burden placed on the urban poor;&#13;
and, second, how, in general terms, government expenditure may be expected&#13;
to contribute to the alleviation of poverty and the meeting of basic needs.&#13;
Measures relating to specific functional areas of government spending will&#13;
be taken up in subsequent chapters.&#13;
1.        Contribution of the Tax System to Poverty Alleviation&#13;
The following quote from Bird and De Wulf (1973, p.672/3) provides&#13;
a good starting point for a discussion of the role of tax policy in poverty&#13;
alleviation:&#13;
"Taxes cannot, of course, make poor people rich. If our&#13;
main concern is with poverty as such, with the waste and&#13;
misuse of human resources and the stunted opportunities&#13;
of those whose incomes fall below some minimum decent&#13;
standard, remedies must come primarily through the&#13;
expenditure side of the budget, either by direct public&#13;
provision of such services as housing, medical care, and&#13;
education, or by simple transfers of income, or through&#13;
employment-creating policies. If the principal aim of&#13;
redistributive policy is to level up--to make the poor&#13;
better off--the main role that the tax system has to&#13;
play is thus the limited and essentially negative one&#13;
of not making them poorer."&#13;
Basically, then, the questions relating to the role of taxation&#13;
are, first, how can regressive taxes be amended, reduced, or eliminated&#13;
to lower the tax burden on the poor; and, second, to the extent that new&#13;
public revenues must be generated by increased taxation, what progressive&#13;
taxes can be relied on more heavily so as to ensure that the burden does&#13;

nint fall on the poor to a significant extent? In keeping with the focus in&#13;
the remainder of this paper, particular attention will be paid to those&#13;
revenue instruments which are commonly within the authority of urban govern-&#13;
ments. Also, as throughout the paper, measures suggested here are not meant&#13;
to provide panacea for the solution of the urban poverty problem; they are&#13;
to be understood merely as ingredients of a comprehensive strategy to deal&#13;
with an extremely complex problem, which cannot be solved by using only one,&#13;
or a small number of policy instruments.&#13;
a.cReducing Regressive Taxes&#13;
At the outset it may be necessary to emphasize that the urban&#13;
poor do pay taxes, and in particular taxes levied by local authorities.   The&#13;
first part of this proposition is demonstrated in the first column of Table&#13;
IV-2. The urban poor are estimated to pay somewhere between 8 and 12 percent&#13;
of their income. in the form of taxes, which is greater than the proportion&#13;
paid by the rural poor, and less than the proportion paid by the urban rich,&#13;
but not generally much less than what is paid by middle-income groups in&#13;
urban areas. While the urban poor tend not to be reached by direct taxation&#13;
such as income and wealth taxes, they contribute considerably through&#13;
indirect taxes, i.e. import duties, sales taxes, sumptuary and other excise&#13;
taxes. It is precisely this phenomenon, coupled with the fact that local&#13;
governments in urban areas often are forced to rely on indirect taxes--the&#13;
only major exception is the real property tax---/ which explains why local&#13;
government taxes often contribute quite heavily to the tax burden on the&#13;

urban poor. Many incidence studies neglect to consider local governments&#13;
due to lack of data, or they do not show separate tax burdens for different&#13;
levels of government,but figures computed for Bogota confirm this conclusion.&#13;
For the lowest two income groups local taxes in 1970 accounted for about a third&#13;
of total taxes paid; for the highest income group the share of local taxes was&#13;
less than 10 percent (Table IV-3). Tax relief for the urban poor should thus&#13;
focus especially on the composition and structure of indirect taxation at the&#13;
national level and on the tax practices of local governments in urban areas.l/&#13;
The main avenues for reductions in the tax burdens on the&#13;
urban poor lie in increasing the scope of exemptions of basic necessities&#13;
from indirect taxes, such as general sales t&amp;xes and import duties; in&#13;
reducing the reliance on sumptuary taxes; and in a reduction or elimination&#13;
of local excise and nuisance taxes, which frequently have regressive tax&#13;
burdens. Exemptions from sales and import taxes should focus particularly&#13;
on such items as unprocessed food stuffs, which weigh heavily in the con-&#13;
sumption baskets of the urban poor. Going much beyond that will increase&#13;
administrative and efficiency costs of exemptions, and may well increase&#13;
the "leakage" of the exemptions in terms of benefiting also higher income&#13;
groups (McLure, 1975, p.19).&#13;
Sumptuary taxes, i.e. taxes levied on alcoholic beverages, tobacco&#13;
products, and gambling     in theory can be structured to fall mainly on&#13;
items of luxury consumption, but in many countries they actually contribute&#13;
importantly to the tax burden on the urban poor. Taxes on beer, on cheap&#13;
1/ One may add that this focus is much less relevant in discussions of&#13;
rural poverty, since the rural poor tend to pay lower taxes in general,&#13;
and fewer local government taxes in particular.&#13;

brands of spirits and on tobacco products, on popular betting games and on&#13;
lotteries are found in many cities of the developing world. While these&#13;
taxes have the advantage of being easy to collect and have a certain ethical&#13;
appeal, especially to the urban elites (since they are seen as taxing&#13;
and limiting vice), they are in fact very regressive. The reason&#13;
for this is that the income and price elasticities for&#13;
consumption of these items are extremely low, and thus their burden falls&#13;
mainly on the poor, without, however, reducing significantly the consumption&#13;
of the items concerned.-' It is of interest to note, for example, that in&#13;
Bogota the local taxes on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products have&#13;
accounted exclusively for the regressivity of local taxation. In recent&#13;
years the local beer tax in Bogota was the one local tax whose revenues&#13;
grew in real per capita terms, so that its contribution to total local tax&#13;
revenues reached 50 percent, while the contribution of other local taxes,&#13;
especially the property tax, dropped in relative and absolute terms (Linn,&#13;
1976).&#13;
Local excise taxes, such as selective taxes on local business&#13;
and commerce, and on local trade^--particularly noteworthy here is the&#13;
2/&#13;
"octroi" tax found in many cities of the Indian subcontinent --are frequently&#13;
1/   See McLure and Thirsk (1973) for an eloquent indictment of sumptuary&#13;
taxes in LDCs. McLure (1975) also points out that governmental concern&#13;
for the negative externalities generated by gambling, alcohol and tobacco&#13;
consumption is contradicted by the frequent support of lotteries and&#13;
of state liquor monopolies,and by the failure to ban advertising for&#13;
alcohol or tobacco products or to advertise against them.&#13;
2/   As mentioned before, this tax is levied on all commodities entering a&#13;
local jurisdiction. In Karachi and three Indian cities surveyed in a&#13;
recent study (Bahl and Linn,.forthcoming) octroi revenues were found to&#13;
contribute some 40 percent of locally raised taxes.&#13;

regressive in their impact. Often, however, an improved rate structure and&#13;
exemption policy could go far in reducing a co.nsiderable part of the burden&#13;
which these taxes place on the urban poor, while retaining the revenue&#13;
generating capacity of these taxes.&#13;
b. Increasing Progressive Taxes&#13;
Elimination or reduction of taxes on the poor, while it is&#13;
2/&#13;
not likely to substantially reduce public revenues-, needs to be balanced by&#13;
increased taxes which presumably would have to fall heavily on the higher&#13;
income groups. Other policies, such as reduced trade protection designed to&#13;
increase labor absorption (see Keesing, 1978) would be another&#13;
reason for the need to increase tax revenues, quite apart from the additional&#13;
3/&#13;
public resource needs generated by an emphasis on basic needs policies.-&#13;
This is not the place for a comprehensive discussion of tax&#13;
policy. For a brief overview of potential changes designed to increase the&#13;
progressivity of typical national-level taxes, such as personal and corporation&#13;
1/   For an example involving the restructuring of the local induutry and&#13;
commerce tax in Cartagena, Colombia, see Linn (1975).&#13;
2/   To postulate an extreme case, assume that all taxes on the poor (i.e., the&#13;
lowest 40 percent of the population in the income distribution) are&#13;
eliminated from a tax structure which initially had a proportional incidence.&#13;
In that case, tax revenues will drop by less than 12 percent in countries&#13;
with high income inequality (i.e. in almost half the LDCs surveyed by&#13;
Ahluwalia, 1974);;by 12 to 17 percent in countries with moderate inequality,&#13;
and by 17 to 20 percent in countries with low inequality (distribution&#13;
figures are based on Ahluwalia, 1974, p.8). Note that the elimination of&#13;
all import taxes in LDCs would reduce their tax revenues by an average of&#13;
about 25 percent (Chelliah, et al., 1975, p.1).&#13;
3/   Obviously, mineral exporting countries need to worry less about their&#13;
ability to raise tax revenues in a non-regressive way, since they can tap&#13;
the fiscal linkages of their mineral resources and shift the tax burden&#13;
abroad.&#13;

- 131 -&#13;
income taxes, wealth and capital gains taxes, and death and gift taxes, the&#13;
reader may want to consult McLure (1975). Substantial increases&#13;
in tax burdens on the rich and middle income groups are limited by the&#13;
general constraints on tax policy mentioned earlier, and the approach will&#13;
have to be designed to fit the special conditions of each particular country&#13;
concerned. Here only a few comments will be made regarding some financing&#13;
instruments which are of special relevance to urban areas and urban govern-&#13;
ments.   The common theme running through these comments is that efforts at&#13;
increasing public revenues in a progressive way must focus on those taxes&#13;
and charges for which escape by the wealthy taxpayers through evasion, brain&#13;
or capital drain, or through reduction in savings or work effort are minimized.&#13;
The instruments discussed are the taxation of urban real estate and of the use&#13;
and ownership of automotive vehicles and various forms of benefit-related&#13;
charges for publicly provided urban services.&#13;
Beginning with the property tax, which is found to play a&#13;
role in financing urban development in most LDCs (Bahl, 1977; Smith, 1974),&#13;
it is necessary to dispel the common misconception that this tax in its basic&#13;
form, i.e. if levied at rates proportional to the value of real estate, is&#13;
regressive in incidence.-!  Recent economic analyses of the incidence of&#13;
urban property taxation in LDCs have established beyond reasonable doubt that,&#13;
in fact, this tax is likely to be quite progressive, unless statutory pro-&#13;
visions and administrative practices are such as to counteract and possibly&#13;
eliminate its inherent progressivity (Bahl and Linn, forthcoming; Linn, 1977),&#13;
1/   For expressions of such a view see e.g. U.S. Department of Housing and&#13;
Urban Development (1973); Robson and Reagan (1972); Hauck Walsh (1969);&#13;
United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (1970).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-132-&#13;
An extensive review of statutory and administrative practices&#13;
in urban property taxation in LDC cities has also ghown that deviations&#13;
from the basic proportional property tax are quite frequent and, depending&#13;
on the country and city concerned, on balance increase or reduce the progres-&#13;
sivity of this tax (Bahl and Linn, forthcoming). Of particular importance&#13;
are the following features designed to increase progressivity: progressively&#13;
graduated tax rates or assessment ratios; exemptions or low assessment ratios&#13;
for low-value properties; higher than average tax rates on vacant lots and/or&#13;
commercial properties; lower tax rates on improvement than on site (land)&#13;
value; better than average collection effort for high-value properties. As&#13;
it happens, the converse of these features, especially regressively graduated&#13;
tax rates, low assessment ratios for high-value properties, higher rates on&#13;
improvements than on site value, lower taxes on vacant lots, and lower&#13;
average collection effort on high-value properties are also quite common,&#13;
and tend to make the urban property tax less.progressive than could be the&#13;
case in the absence of such provisions. Quite frequently, also, owner-&#13;
occupied properties are given favorable treatment as compared with rental&#13;
properties, which would also tend to reduce progressivity.&#13;
Taking a broad overview of urban property tax administration&#13;
in all of the cities and countries surveyed by Bahl and Linn (forthcoming)&#13;
and asses;sing the distributive impact of these practices one finds that&#13;
in 17 out of 32 cases the overall impact of these institutional aspects is&#13;
progressive, when compared with a proportional property tax; in six cases it&#13;
appears to be regressive. In the remainder of the cases it is either&#13;
impossible to assign a clear direction to the impact of the administrative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 133 -&#13;
practices, or procedures with mutually off-setting distributive effects&#13;
are being applied. The last set of cases clearly reflects the ad hoc&#13;
nature in which distributive objectives are pursued in property taxation;&#13;
in these cities progressively structured tax rates and exemptions of&#13;
owmer-occupied properties may typically be found side by side.&#13;
This brief review of property tax incidence in LDC cities can&#13;
close with two policy recommendations: First, in-those cities where regres-&#13;
sive property tax practices are prevalent an effort should be made to&#13;
eliminate these practices since their removal would improve&#13;
revenues, efficiency, equity, and administrative ease. Furthermore,&#13;
at least some of the measures which increase the progressivity of property&#13;
taxes, such as higher rates of taxes on site value as compared with improve-&#13;
ment value, higher than average rates of taxes on vacant lots,and exemption&#13;
of low-value or slum properties would very likely increase progressivity&#13;
and efficiency.-/ Second, overall reliance on property taxes could probably&#13;
be increased in many cities in LDCs. Average effective tax rates tend to&#13;
be extremely low compared with those found in the industrialized countries&#13;
(Bahl, 1977); real estate taxation, and especially urban land taxation, is&#13;
hard to escape if properly administered efficiency losses are likely to be&#13;
1/   Higher than average taxation of luxury housing is advocated by McLure&#13;
(1975), but is not found in any of the cities surveyed above.   To the&#13;
extent that luxury housing represents an identifiable category of real&#13;
estate--this depends an assessment practices, but would clearly bg possible&#13;
in a number of countries, such as Colombia (Linn, 1975)--such a measure&#13;
wo,uld indeed be a further way to increase the progressivity of property&#13;
taxation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 134&#13;
limited; ad popular support could be rallied around the likely impact which&#13;
higher land taxation has in terms of lowering the rate of growth of urban&#13;
land prices.&#13;
One of the particularly attractive aspects of effective urban&#13;
land taxation is that it can act as an instrument to appropriate for public&#13;
use sern of the windfall gains which urban land owners reap especially in&#13;
the rapidly growing cities of developing countries. These windfall gains&#13;
are one of the major ways by which the benefits of public infrastructure&#13;
provision and of the agglomeration economies of urban growth are translated&#13;
into increased wealth. Particularly in cities where the ownership of land&#13;
is highly concentrated, a substantial share of the benefits from urbanization&#13;
accrue to a few rich people. An effective system of benefit charges for&#13;
urban services, which recovers at least the cost of service provision, will&#13;
in part reduce the need for general land taxation, but usually there is&#13;
plenty of scope for improvements in. both areas, i.e. property taxation and&#13;
benefit charges. Some countries have experimented with property taxes designed&#13;
specifically to capture the land value increments, but with the exception of&#13;
the experience in Taiwan,. a general tax on land value increases has not&#13;
appeared to work successfully in LDCs and industrialized countries alike.-&#13;
Lest it be thought that these two suggested improveements in&#13;
property taxation in LDCs are of the pie-in-the-sky variety, especially&#13;
1/ See for instance Grimes (1974) and Shoup (1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 135 -&#13;
in terms of administrative and political feasibility., one may add that recent&#13;
experiences with property tax reform in such diverging environments as Jamaica&#13;
and Jalkarta (Indonesia) show that progressive change is possible.i' Of&#13;
course, such changes take considerable time and effort, but they should be&#13;
seen as falling within the realm of the possible, and concerted efforts can&#13;
be made in many LDC cities to improve property taxation. The revenue impact&#13;
could be quite substantial:  *ile for a sample of 47 LDCs the average con-&#13;
tribution of property taxes to total tax sevenue was only 5 percent between&#13;
1969 and 1971, it is 10 percent in Turkey, 12.5 percent in Lebanon, 14.5&#13;
percent in the Republic of China, 23.8 percent in Nepal, and 27.1 percent&#13;
in Singapore (Chelliah VL_.A3, 1975). In the case of Jamaica property tax&#13;
revenues increased fivefold in the period 1972-1976, and the contribution of&#13;
property taxes to total national government tax revenues increased from 2.6&#13;
percent in 1971/2 to 5.4 percent in 1975/6 as a result of the property tax&#13;
reform (Risden, 1976).&#13;
Another are' where potential improvements in taxation and urban&#13;
2/&#13;
development closely overlap is the area of automotive taxation.- Automobile&#13;
ownership and use provide an excellent but much neglected tax base for urban&#13;
governments in the cities of developing countries (LDCs). The number of&#13;
automobiles registered in those cities in recent years has grown much faster.&#13;
than city populations, and in all LDCs car ownership is heavily concentrated&#13;
1/ For the Jamaican case see Risden (1976), and Bougeon-Maassen and Linn&#13;
(1975). For the case of Jakarta, see Linn et al. (1976); recent&#13;
developments in that city indicate even more far-reaching changes than&#13;
described in this report.&#13;

Walters (1969).&#13;

-136-&#13;
in the largest cities. Furthermore, the overwhelming proportion of the&#13;
urban motor vehicle fleet in LDCs consists of automobiles, and these in&#13;
turn are owned and operated mainly by the upper income classes. Traffic&#13;
congestion and air pollution are as bad in many of the cities of developing&#13;
countries as in those of the industrialized nations, and are largely due to&#13;
automobile traffic and emissions.   These trends, patterns, and problems are&#13;
likely to become even more pronounded with the rapid expansion in urban&#13;
areas and with continued increases in incomes in LDCs. / In any case, owner-&#13;
ship and use of motorvehicles are a uniiquely urban phenomenon in LDCs, even&#13;
more so than in industrialized countries. Therefore, special attention&#13;
should be paid to questions of automotive taxation in the cities of LDCs.&#13;
Since the present section is less concerned with increasing&#13;
efficiency, but mainly with the issue of how to raise additional public&#13;
revenues in a way that puts relatively little burden on the urban poor while&#13;
not having overly deleterious efficiency implications, the main tax instru-&#13;
ments discussed here are fuel taxes, taxes on the import and sale .of motor&#13;
vehi&amp;les, and taxes on licensing and ownership transfer of automobiles, rather&#13;
than on charges designed to reduce central city congestion.- National govern-&#13;
ments tend to rely more heavily on taxes on automobile imports and on fuel&#13;
use, while urban local governments, to the extent that they apply automotive&#13;

Chapter V below.&#13;
2/ These charges, in particular parking fees and area license fees, are&#13;
discussed in the next chapter. Their incidence is certainly progressive,&#13;
at least in the sense that they are not likely to burden the urban poor;&#13;
however, they generally yield only limited increases in public revenues&#13;
net of administration costs (Linn, 1979).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 137 -&#13;
taxes at all, rely more heavily on annual license taxes. The use of all&#13;
these taxes varies widely between countries.-L/ In most of them, increased&#13;
utilization of some of these taxes is a distinct possibility, judging by&#13;
the experience of selected high tax countries (e.g.,Colombia, Pakistan,&#13;
Mexico, Egypt and Indonesia have very high import duties, with rates of&#13;
200 percent or over). Each of these taxes has some advantages and disad-&#13;
vantages in terms of ease of collection, efficiency impacts, and revenue&#13;
capacity. All of them, however, are likely to put only very little burdens&#13;
on the urban poor, and even less on the rural poor. Which of these taxes&#13;
ought to be relied on more heavily in specific LDCs depends very much on&#13;
the extent to which they are currently utilized, and no general prescription&#13;
(beyond the one that increased reliance on automotive taxes appears possible&#13;
in most LDCs) can be derived.2/&#13;
Two additional points can be raised here as being of particular&#13;
relevance to the focus of this paper. First, the bulk of automotive tax&#13;
revenuesi is raised in most countries at the national level, while local urban&#13;
governments make only very limited tax efforts in this area. There is,&#13;
1/ See for instance, World Bank (1975b) , Annex 2, for comparative information&#13;
on import taxes on cars; Smith (1975) for across-country information&#13;
regarding national taxes on fuel and automobile ownership; and Linn (1979)&#13;
ior comparative information regarding the automotive taxes levied by local&#13;
governments in selected LDC cities.&#13;
2/ Walters (1969) argues that in general fuel taxes are too high in LDCs in&#13;
that they are likely to engender efficiency losses except in congested&#13;
urban traffic. He therefore appears to favor annual license taxes related&#13;
to vehicle value as a means of raising fiscal resources. Smith (1975) views&#13;
the efficiency losses of high fuel taxes as less serious although he, too,&#13;
supports annual license fees for revenue purposes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 138 -&#13;
however, scope for increased local action on this front in many cities, by&#13;
levying differentially higher fuel and vehicle license taxes in urban areas&#13;
(Linn, 1979).i/ Second, in tax design, care must be taken to exempt, where-&#13;
ever possible, tax bases which are primarily used by low income groups, in&#13;
particular fuels destined for home-use and buses.-   Also, differentially&#13;
higher rates applying to luxury cars, as found in some countries for import&#13;
tariffs (World Bank, 1975b, Appendix),   will increase the progressivity of&#13;
automotive taxes of the upper end of the income scale, without however doing&#13;
much to increase revenues or to lower tax burdens on the poor.&#13;
One may then turn to the possibility of increasing public&#13;
revenues through a more progressive use of benefit charges in the provision&#13;
of urban public services. Much will be said throughout the remainder of&#13;
this paper regarding the importance of financing policies in the design and&#13;
provision of tirban public services. Here the point is merely made that the&#13;
failure to recoup urban service costs from beneficiaries in the past has&#13;
led frequently to extensive subsidies particularly to higher income groups.&#13;
The types of services for which subsidies are provided include&#13;
public housing, public utilities, urban road space, secondary and tertiary&#13;
education, and modern hospital care. Examples for subsidies in the provision&#13;
of these services will be cited in chapters below dealing separately with each&#13;
of these functional areas. Two general points are to be made here: First,&#13;
subsidies in urban public service provision more often than not benefit the&#13;
1/ This is particularly the case, if general trade liberalization measures&#13;
were to lead to substantial reductions in tariffs on automobiles.&#13;
2/ The local taxes on buses in Indian, Korean, and Colombian municipalities&#13;
arenot defensible on grounds of equity, efficiency, or revenue generation&#13;
(Linn, 1979).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 139 -&#13;
wealthier income groups because of (a) the.superior political influence of&#13;
these groups in drawing service provision into their neighborhoods or iL. preempting&#13;
the available services such as public housing, (b) the concentration of urban&#13;
property ownership in the hands of high income groups, and the fact that the&#13;
benefits from urban public services are at least partially capitalized into&#13;
land value; and (c) the fact that by virtue of complementary private costs&#13;
(e.g. out-of-pocket expenses and loss of income when attending school or&#13;
visiting modern hospitals, or the expense of purchasing a private automobile)&#13;
the poor are not able to benefit from some public services. As a result, the&#13;
elimination of subsidies for urban public services would in many cases provide&#13;
additional public revenues mainly by drawing on the resources of the wealthier&#13;
groups, while at the same time increasing the efficiency of resource alloca-&#13;
tion, since cost-related prices will make the service user aware of the&#13;
resource cost of public service provision, and will thus curtail demand for&#13;
these services to efficient levels.&#13;
The areas where improved service pricing and benefit taxation&#13;
could significantly contribute to equity, efficiency, and public revenue&#13;
availability are the following: public housing should be priced at full&#13;
costs;- the average incremental capital and recurrent cost of public utility&#13;
services should be charged to the user, subject to possible provisions of&#13;
1/   Public housing for civil servants provides an added element of complica-&#13;
tion, however: to the extent that the elimination of subsidized housing&#13;
for civil servants reduces their real wages below the level at which&#13;
adequately skilled professionals can be attracted to government civil&#13;
service, wages may have to be increased. However, this would appear to be&#13;
a preferable approach, since it provides a clearer and more flexible form&#13;
of public sector salary structure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- .140 -&#13;
"life-line" rates or similar measures to permit access even for the very poor;&#13;
central city road use by private automobiles hhould be priced at social costs&#13;
through area licensing fees and/or parking fees; the improvement of neighbor-&#13;
hood streets and even major arterial roads should be financed from betterment&#13;
levies, as practiced widely for instance in the cities of Colombia;&#13;
the provision of public higher .educatioon could be financed&#13;
from student loans or parent contributions, graduated by income&#13;
levels; the provision of modern health services for the wealthy ought to be&#13;
financed fully through actuarially sound insurance schemes. These are very&#13;
broad prescriptions for the elimination of service subsidies benefiting&#13;
mainly the rich; obviously, a more differentiated look must be taken at many&#13;
of these financing mechanisms. This will be done in later chapters.&#13;
The second point to be made is that it may be easier adminis-&#13;
tratively and politically to raise public revenues where the relationship&#13;
of the charge to the benefits from the provision of particular services is&#13;
clearly established in the mind of the taxpayer than where this relationship&#13;
its quite remdte as in the case of income or wealth taxes.-/ One should also point&#13;
out, however, that there are a few common obstacles to increased reliance on&#13;
benefit taxation; besides political clout by traditional beneficiaries of&#13;
subsidized services, there is the problem that the expectation of free or&#13;
subsidized provision of certain services such as water supply, central city&#13;
road use and neighborhood streets, public bus services, and education may&#13;
have become so ingrained in the popular mind that any efforts to start&#13;
1/ It is of some interest to note that in many industrialized countries efforts&#13;
are made to increase the reliance on benefit taxes and user charges reversing&#13;
a long trend to general tax financing; see Bird (1976).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 141 -&#13;
charging unsubsidized rates will result in considerable negative public&#13;
reaction. In part, this may be explained by the fact that the introduction&#13;
of even relatively small recurrent fees may lead to considerable windfall&#13;
loses, because of the capitalization of the entire stream of expected future&#13;
charges into lower asset values, particularly lower land values. Another&#13;
explanation is that people will feel unfairly treated by the introduction&#13;
of measures designed to recover service costs from them, if their&#13;
neighbors have received the same service free of charge in the&#13;
recent past. This does not mean that efforts at increased reliance on&#13;
benefit charges need to be entirely abandoned. What it does mean is that&#13;
these charges have to be carefully planned and implemented and may need to&#13;
be introduced on a gradual basis. The experience of the World Bank in this&#13;
area, especially as regards public utility charges, is that increased reliance&#13;
on benefit charges is indeed a possibility in many urban areas, for rich and&#13;
poor beneficiaries alike.l/&#13;
2.   Poverty Alleviation through Public Expenditure&#13;
The extensive discussion of alternative public revenue sources in the&#13;
preceding section notwithstanding, it is on the expenditure side of the public&#13;
budget where the real potential for poverty alleviation and most of the problems&#13;
in achieving it are encountered. -/ It is through the provision of public&#13;
services such as transportation, shelter and urban infrastructure, education&#13;
and health, that LDC governments can attempt to eliminate, or at least reduce&#13;
the incidence of urban poverty. Obviously, the scope for urban poverty&#13;
1/ See for instance Shipman (1967) for a discussion of changes that have&#13;
taken place during the 1960s in Latin American attitudes towards user&#13;
charge financing of water supply services.&#13;
2/ See Bird and De Wulf (1973) and McLure (1975).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 142&#13;
alleviation will vary between countries, depending among other things on the&#13;
share of public expenditure in GNP relative to the share of the income of the&#13;
poor in GNP, and depending on the extent to which the poor are falling short&#13;
of the absolute poverty threshold,  To quote from Selowsky (forthcoming, p, 1);&#13;
"Where public expenditures are initially liarge relative&#13;
to the income shares of the poorest segments of the population,&#13;
this policy (a change in the composition of public expenditures)&#13;
has a special appeal. If these expenditures and the income of the&#13;
poorest 20 percent of the population account for 25 and 5 percent&#13;
of the GNP, respectively, a reallocation of 10 percent of the&#13;
budget in favor of this group will raise its income by 50&#13;
percent."&#13;
One may add, that if an increase in income of 100 percent is needed to lift the&#13;
poor over the poverty threshold, then of course the reallocation of the budget&#13;
must be in the order of 20 percent. Similarly, if the poorest 40 percent of&#13;
the population fall below the poverty threshhold, and, say, receive 10 percent&#13;
of GNP, then again a reallocation of 20 percent of the budget is required to&#13;
lift thair incomes by 50 percent. One might further add that since the&#13;
government sector tends to be relatively more important in urban than in rural areas&#13;
and since the proportion of the absolute poor in urban areas is generally less&#13;
than in the rural areas,l/ a relatively much smaller shift in urban-oriented&#13;
public expenditures is required in principle to eliminate absolute urban&#13;
poverty, than is the case in rural areas.- On the other hand, in the low-income&#13;
countries, where a larger proportion of the population tends to live below&#13;
1/ See Chapter II above.&#13;
2/ This statement only refers to the relative scope for urban versus rural&#13;
poverty alleviation, not to their relative importance,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the absolute poverty threshold, a larger effort in budget shifting may&#13;
be required in both urban and rural areas, especially if the share of&#13;
public spending in total GNP also tends to be smaller than in the middle&#13;
income countries.&#13;
However, shifting expenditures in favor of the poor is easier&#13;
said than done for a number of reasons. First, there are the&#13;
political obstacles which may preclude such a reorientation of public&#13;
budgets, even where efficiency and equity goals are served at the same&#13;
time.-/ Second, direct transfers of current incomes from higher to&#13;
lower income groups through the budget are not costless and in fact do&#13;
not appear to exist on a large scale anywhere in LDCs. Even in the&#13;
industrialized countries a debate has been carried on for many years&#13;
whether and how such transfers should be carried out.&#13;
Third, with direct income transfers out of the running one is&#13;
left with the possibility of public intervention in goods and service&#13;
provision and thus lowering service cost to the poor, by producing a "fiscal&#13;
dividend," by providing subsidies, or providing both of these jointly.&#13;
Reaping the benefits of fiscal dividends for the poor is, of course, the&#13;
most attractive route since this does not involve a conflict between&#13;
the efficiency and the equity geals.'/ Subsidies (unless based on&#13;
1/ This point was raised in Chapter II above.&#13;
2/ Yet, a conflict remains between high and low income groups; see&#13;
Chapter II above.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 144&#13;
externality arguments) are in general less attractive, since they involve&#13;
efficiency and public revenue losses. But for both types of policies&#13;
the same question remains: How can one design a public expenditure&#13;
policy which will ensure that the benefits from public expenditures&#13;
actually accrue to the poor, rather than the better-off. Capitalization&#13;
of fiscal dividends and subsidies into land values, preemption of&#13;
public housing by the rich although ostensibly constructed for the poor,&#13;
high drop-out rates of poor children from the conventional school system&#13;
-- these are just three of many examples of how public expenditure policy&#13;
may not reach the poor even where it intends to do so. Careful design of&#13;
public expenditure programs is therefore the prerequisite for any policy&#13;
which proposes to alleviate urban poverty. The remaining chapters of&#13;
this paper will address this issue for specific areas of urban policy.&#13;
&#13;

D. SUMMARY OF POLICY IMPLICATIONS&#13;
The scope for general redistribution of income is limited in&#13;
most countries, and in any case a reduction in the skewness of the income&#13;
distribution by itself does not necessarily provide a solution to the&#13;
poverty problem. In order to work toward such a solution, fiscal policies&#13;
should be focussed explicitly on the poverty problem, both as regards the&#13;
generation of public revenues as well as regarding the allocation of public&#13;
expenditures. In any case, the urban poverty problem will need to be solved&#13;
by drawing on resources generated in urban, rather than in rural areas. An&#13;
urban poverty-oriented fiscal strategy will have to involve the following&#13;
major elements of tax and expenditure policies.&#13;
1.        Tax Policy&#13;
The urban poor pay taxes, especially indirect taxes and taxes&#13;
levied by local governments. Tax policy should therefore be designed to&#13;
reduce this burden, e.g. by exemptions of basic food stuffs from indirect&#13;
taxation, and by a reduction in sumptuary taxes. The revenue loss resulting&#13;
from these measures will generally be minor.&#13;
In raising additional public revenues emphasis should be put on&#13;
these revenue services which fall relatively lightly on the poor. Of parti-&#13;
cular interest in urban areas are:&#13;
a. property taxation, which has generally a progressive incidence&#13;
in LDC cities, and which can be explicitly structured to&#13;
increase progressivity, without significant losses in terms of&#13;
efficiency, revenue potential, or administrative simplicity;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-146-&#13;
b. motor vehicle taxation (especially taxes on private automobiles),&#13;
which provides an excellent base in urban areas for progressive&#13;
taxation by national and local authorities;&#13;
c. elimination of subsidies in public service provision, where&#13;
these tend to benefit mainly the middle and upper income classes,&#13;
especially in subsidized public housing, public utilities, urban&#13;
Enad space, advanced formal education and modern health faci-&#13;
lities.&#13;
2.        Expenditure Policy&#13;
Public expenditure, and in particular provision of public services,&#13;
is the most important means by which the alleviation of urban poverty must be&#13;
sought in the short and medium term, since productivity and employment&#13;
opportunities for the poor can be increased only slowly. In theory,&#13;
relatively small shifts in public expenditure would suffice in some countries&#13;
to raise the absolute poor above the poverty threshold. In practice, it is&#13;
more difficult to design expenditure programs which ensure that the poor&#13;
derive most of the benefits, whether these are derived from "fiscal dividends"&#13;
or subsidies.&#13;
&#13;

V.  URBAN TRANSPORTATION&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
"Urban tranaport is in many respects a leading influence&#13;
in determining urban patterns both physical and social.&#13;
As such, projects and policies in this field lead&#13;
directly into general policies and plans for improving&#13;
urban structure and productivity, and reducing urban&#13;
poverty." (World Bank, 1975b, p.58)&#13;
The importance of the transportation sector in urban development&#13;
has many dimensions. Its basic functions are to provide essential linkages&#13;
between residence and employment, and between producers and users of goods&#13;
and services, both intermediate and final. Urban transport is complementary&#13;
with a large number of other urban public services because the accessibility&#13;
of an urban neighborhood determines to a considerable extent whether, or at&#13;
least how easily, solid waste is collected, water, sewerage, drainage, and&#13;
electricity networks are provided and maintained, police and fire protection&#13;
is made available, and schools and health care are within reach of the&#13;
inhabitants. Furthermore, since the transport system has an important impact&#13;
on a city's physical extension, in particular the population density, and&#13;
population density in turn directly affects the cost of infrastructure pro-&#13;
vision, urban transport policy may have a considerable impact on the cost&#13;
of other urban services.&#13;
The urban transportation sector is important in other respects.&#13;
It provides employment to a significant although varying proportion of the&#13;
urban population.-/ It also places a considerable financial burden on the&#13;
1/   An extreme, and probably somewhat biased estimate of the employment impact&#13;
of a particular form of urban transport was recorded in Manila, where&#13;
about 10% of the labor force is supposedly directly or indirectly involved&#13;
in the provision of "jeepney" (communal taxi) services (World Bank, 1975c).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 148 -&#13;
public authorities in urban areas: Although the proportions vary, it is not&#13;
unusual for urban governments to spend between 15 and 25 percent of their&#13;
annual budgets on transport related investment and operating activities&#13;
(Bahl and Linn, forthcoming). Total public investments programmed&#13;
for the transportation sectors in Bombay and Calcutta for the period 1972-78&#13;
accounted respectively for 26 and 48 percent of total planned investment&#13;
(World Bank, 1973a).&#13;
For the urban poor, transport facilities are particularly important&#13;
because the poor, by definition, are at the margin of subsistence and are espe-&#13;
cially sensitive to disruptions in their earnings brought about by poor transport&#13;
policies, be it with respect to their employment or service access, or in carry-&#13;
ing out small-scale commercial and trading activities. Improved transport&#13;
access to poor neighborhoods can improve their employment prospects, reduce&#13;
money and time spent on getting to jobs, reduce the costs of inputs for their&#13;
small-scale enterprise activities, and improve the access to markets for their&#13;
products. It also facilitates the provision of and access to all the other&#13;
public services in poor areas. Finally, the transport sector itself provides&#13;
employment opportunities to the poor which are not negligible (Table III-2&#13;
above), and which can be increased or reduced by urban transport policies.l/&#13;
Given the important role which the transport system has to play in&#13;
urban development in general, and in the improvement of living conditions of&#13;
the poor in particular, the fact that the system fails to play this role&#13;
1/   Most notable are the banning of "bekjas", a cycle-powered taxi, in&#13;
Jakarta (World Bank, 1975b, p.40) on the negative end of the spectrum,&#13;
and on the positive side the encouragement of similar vehicles in&#13;
Hyderabad throughl appropriate credit policies (Cousins, 1977).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 149 -&#13;
efficiently and equitably in most large cities in the LDCs, acquires a&#13;
special urgency. The following brief summary of the transportation problem&#13;
in Manila is representative for many, if not all of the large LDC cities.&#13;
"Metropolitan Manila's growth has far outstripped the&#13;
capacity of its transportation infrastructure, both the&#13;
road network and mass transportation facilities. Rapidly&#13;
increasing travel demands have been accommodated by a&#13;
transport system whose nature has changed little since&#13;
the turn of the century. As a result, Manila is almost&#13;
entirely dependent on road-based transport, road space is&#13;
inadequate, and severe traffic congestion has become the&#13;
normal condition. Perhaps an even more important problem&#13;
is the absence of any plan to help the transport system&#13;
conform to the demands generated by the emerging distribu-&#13;
tion of metropolitan employment and residence locations.&#13;
Proposed solutions to Manila's transport problems range&#13;
from networks of high standard roads, to subways and&#13;
elevated magnetic levitation systems for public transport&#13;
to improved traffic control. Some of these options have&#13;
been studied extensively and others are simply ideas, but&#13;
in any case little has been accomplish- d in the way of&#13;
investment or management improvement to either expand the&#13;
system or improve its operation." (World Bank, 1975c)&#13;
The various ingredients which make urban transport a mess in most&#13;
LDC cities have been documented in World Bank (1975b), and will be extensively&#13;
reviewed below. They include a 'high degree of congestion and pollution in&#13;
central cities despite the generally low levels of motorization; inadequacy&#13;
of public transport and of paved urban road space; limited public resources;&#13;
and poor transport sector management. These urban transport problems&#13;
and misguided policies are, of course, not unique to LDC cities, but&#13;
are also prevalent in the cities of the indust-7alized countries.&#13;
There are, however, two differences worth noting: Fir,,t, at the low levels&#13;
of incomes and extreme resource limitations under which LDCs have to operate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 150&#13;
any major mistake, or any forgone opportunity to improve significantly the&#13;
efficiency and equity of resource allocation, must weigh much more heavily&#13;
than in the advanced countries, where such an event is troublesome, but can&#13;
be absorbed relatively easily at high levels of income. Second, the degree&#13;
of motirization, and in particular the extent of private car ownership and&#13;
use, is still relatively low in most LDCs, although it is increasing at a&#13;
rapid rate.  Since many, if not most urban transport problems are related&#13;
directly to the use of the private automobile, as will be argued below, LDC&#13;
cities still have a chance to avoid the mistakes made in many of the indus-&#13;
trialized countries in developiig inefficient urban forms. Policy action,&#13;
hovver, must be swift, if this chance is not to be lost.    It is encouraging&#13;
that in some LDC cities conventional transport policies are being replaced&#13;
by more efficient and equitable approaches.&#13;
One of the prerequisites for appropriate policy in dealing with&#13;
the urban transport problem in LDC cities is the realization that transport-&#13;
ation is only a means to an end, namely access and communication. These can&#13;
be fostered not only by direct action in the transport sector but can also&#13;
be affected by appropriate land use policy.     Of particular importance are&#13;
the decentralization of employment opportunities away from established&#13;
centers or "corridors" within metropolitan areas, and the location of public&#13;
service facilities that are close to the intended consumer of these services,&#13;
especially in the case of public administration, health and education faci-&#13;
lities. The relationships between urban land use and the transportation&#13;
system are extremely complex, however, as is reflected in this introductory&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 151 -&#13;
statement of the World Bank's Urban Transport Sector Policy Paper:&#13;
"The Sector Policy paper is purposely tentative in regard&#13;
to both its conclusions and the scale of the programs&#13;
recommended. Surprisingly little is known about&#13;
analyzing the long-term implications of alternative&#13;
urban transport strategies and investments... But these&#13;
limitations should not mean that action is inhibited."&#13;
(World Bank, 1975b, p.4/5)&#13;
This chapter proceeds very much in the spirit of the statement&#13;
just cited: While many aspects of urban transport sector policy are subject&#13;
to considerable uncertainty, there exist a number of areas where the evidence&#13;
points clearly in the direction of certain preferred policy actions that&#13;
can be strongly supported and should be vigorously pursued.&#13;
.The remainder of this chapter falls into three sections. Section&#13;
II documents some of the major trends and determinants of urban transport-&#13;
ation in LDCs. Section III reviews the transport problems faced by the&#13;
urban poor in LDC cities, and disc-usses the various policies which need to&#13;
be pursued in order to reduce these problems,&#13;
B. Urban Transport in LDCs: Trends,&#13;
Determinants and Policies&#13;
The rapid growth of cities in developing countries has brought&#13;
with it an increased need for urban transportation. Where for a small city&#13;
or town it is possible to reach virtually every point on foot or by bicycle&#13;
within reasonable time, large cities require extensive motorized transport-&#13;
ation systems to permit the movement of people and goods between various&#13;
locations. Indeed, the rapid rate of motorization which accompanies rapid&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 152 -&#13;
urbanization and income growth, has led to a situation where "two kinds of&#13;
population explosions have been worrying the authorities in many parts of&#13;
the world during recent times--of people and of cars." (Zahavi, 1976, p.1)&#13;
As a comparison of population growth rates with the rates of growth of&#13;
1/&#13;
automobile ownership for selected LDC cities show in Table V-lf, the growth&#13;
in the number of automobiles has universally been much more rapid than the&#13;
growth in population, and thus, on all accounts, authorities should have&#13;
worried more about the former than about the latter, especially since the&#13;
ownership and use of motorvehicles, particularly of the private auto-&#13;
mobile, is very costly in terms of public and private resource commitments,&#13;
and is likely to be more easily controlled by appropriate policy actions&#13;
than is the rate of growth' of the urban population.&#13;
This section will provide a summary overview of the most important&#13;
trends in urban transport patterns in LDC cities, and of the available&#13;
evidence regarding the variables affecting the demand for, and the cost of&#13;
urban transport, such as city size, population density, modal split, urban&#13;
form and land use patterns, as well as pricing, regulation, and other&#13;
institutional determinants. This information provides an important backdrop&#13;
for the policy analysis of the subsequent section.&#13;
1.        Transport Demand&#13;
Research on travel demand characteristics in cities of- developing&#13;
and developed countries has investigated the relationship between transport&#13;
demand and city size, density, and motorization. The following statement&#13;
provides a succinct summary of the results:&#13;

Because of the variety of sources, differences of definition and general weaknesses of collection, the data, though Indicating orders of magnitude, have only lImited comparability.&#13;
Caution is accordingly required In their use. See following page for general notes and sources.&#13;
The data in the table were obtained from several publications Indicated below, supplemented by information in various urban and transport studies available in the Bank. Information was also&#13;
coliected by World Bank missions and from government authorities. Since the sources and methods of data collection are extremely diverse, the table indicates only In rough measure conditions&#13;
of urbanization and motorization.&#13;
Data for columns 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7 are for 1970, except In the case of a few cities for which data for 1969 or 1971 had to be used.&#13;
Rates of growth in columns 2 and 5 are for 1960-70, except for a few cities where growth rates were available for a shorter period only. Growth rates In parentheses are for the country and not&#13;
the city.&#13;
For columns 8 and 9, a Toyota Corona was used to represent an economy car and a Mercedes-Benz 280 a luxury car.&#13;
In column 11, the data are for different years, depending on the most recent traffic survey available to the Bank. The different years are shown in the footnotes.&#13;

"When a city grows in population and size, average trip&#13;
distances lengthen. The analysis indicates that for a&#13;
given population density trip distances increase roughly&#13;
in proportion to the square root of the radius of the&#13;
city. For instance, growth in city population, say&#13;
from 1 to 2, 4 and 8 million, with population density&#13;
remaining constant, may be expected to increase average&#13;
trip distance by roughly 20%, 40% and 65%, respectively,&#13;
from the initial level.&#13;
"Decreasing population density tends to increase the trip&#13;
distance, since a lower density implies a larger area&#13;
for the same population. Thus, if two cities have the&#13;
same population, say 2 million, but one has a population&#13;
density of 12,000 people per square mile, while the other&#13;
has a density of 6,000, the average trip distance in the&#13;
latter case will be found to be longer by about 20% than&#13;
in the first case.&#13;
"When cities grow in population, population densities tend&#13;
after a time to decrease.l/ Thus, the adverse effects of&#13;
increase in population and decrease in density tend to&#13;
cumulate. For instance, if a city grows from 2 to 4&#13;
million while its population density decreases from 10,000&#13;
to 8,000, the average trip distance may be expected to&#13;
increase by about 25%. If an average vehicle in the first&#13;
case makes five trips during its daily travel time of 1.2&#13;
hours at a speed of 12.5 miles per hour, the same vehicle&#13;
will probably have to travel at a speed of 16.5 miles per&#13;
hour to make the same number of trips in the second case.&#13;
Furthermore, the same vehicle in a city of 8 million with&#13;
a population density of 6,000 will need a speed of about&#13;
20 miles per hour to achieve the same trip rate. This&#13;
explains why travel speeds have to increase in expanding&#13;
cities if vehicle trip rates are to be maintained within&#13;
the same travel time per vehicle per day.&#13;
"For a given flow of vehicles, higher zpeeds require more&#13;
(and/or better) roads. By considering the relationship&#13;
between flow, speed and arterial roads for the previous&#13;
example, it can be shown that while the ratio of road&#13;
length to population in a city of 1 million is likely to&#13;
be about 0.42 miles per 10,000 people for a population&#13;
density of 10,000 and a motorization level of 5 cars per&#13;
100 people, the ratio of road length per 10,000 people&#13;
is likely to increase to about 1.48 in a city with 8&#13;
million and population density of 6,000 per square mile,&#13;
/   For a recent confirmation of this observation for a number of large&#13;
Latin American cities, see Ingram and Carroll (1978).&#13;

even if the level of motQrization remains the same.&#13;
Some 3.5 times more roads per inhabitant will be&#13;
required to keep the same level of mobility at the&#13;
same level of motorization.  This appears to be one&#13;
explanation of the increasing difficulties in provid-&#13;
ing adequate mobility in larger cities, particularly&#13;
those that expand rapidly.&#13;
"When the factor of motorization is added, travel con-&#13;
ditions are aggravated even further since more cars&#13;
per hundred population will requiire more roads if&#13;
speeds are to be maintained withirn the same travel&#13;
period.&#13;
"Thus, under the conditions of this example, if motor-&#13;
ization levels were to increase from 5 to 10 cars per&#13;
100 inhabitants, the road density would have to be&#13;
increased from 0.42 to 2.49, namely a sixfold increase."&#13;
(Zahavi, 1976, p.76/78).&#13;
City size thus is a crucial variaDle in determining travel length,&#13;
speed, and the need for transport infrastructure investment. However, since&#13;
1/&#13;
city size is to a large degree beyond the influence of policy, and almost&#13;
certainly beyond the policy domain of urban government in a particular city,&#13;
the question is what determines the other major variables, density and&#13;
motorization.&#13;
Beginning with population density, this is unfortunately a very&#13;
complex and little investigated area of urban research. Many factors determine&#13;
the average density of cities and its changes over time, among others the&#13;
provision and pricing of urban services (including that of urban transport),&#13;
the extent of motorization, land use policies such as zoning, differential&#13;
land taxation, employment location decisions by private and public enterprises.&#13;
Also, income is an important and pervasive variable since higher&#13;
incomes tend to be associated with greater demand for residential&#13;

land and permit more costly urban service networks due to a lower resource&#13;
constraint on public and private decision makers. In any case, density&#13;
changes are likely to be slow and intricately involved with the type of&#13;
urban transport network which is developed over time, and in particular&#13;
the extent of motorization.&#13;
The degree of motorization is clearly associated with the level&#13;
1/&#13;
of income of a country and a city.    Table VI-1 above lists a set of pertinent&#13;
data for a large number of cities in developing countries--and for a small&#13;
number of cities of industrialized countries--, from which it is found that&#13;
the correlation coefficient between average per capita income in LDC cities&#13;

and the number of automobiles per 1,000 population is 0.61.    What is,&#13;
however, of greater importance for an understanding of transport demand&#13;
is information on the modes of urban trip taking, rather than on the owner-&#13;
ship of particular types of vehicles, although there is, of course, likely&#13;
to be a close relationship between vehicle ownership and use.&#13;
Unfortunately, data on the modal split of urban trips covering the&#13;
entire range of modes, including walking and cycling, are very scarce&#13;
(Zahavi, 1976, p.ix). However, there is little doubt that as incomes increase&#13;
the proportion of non-motorized trips in total trip making tends to decline.&#13;
According to recent estimates, walking trips have accounted for two-thirds&#13;
1/   Zahavi (1976) has shown that this holds for countries and cities, whether&#13;
or not one considers only LDCs, or LDCs and developed countries jointly.&#13;
2/   For the cities of the middle income countries the mean rate of automobile&#13;
ownership is 54.4 per thousand (standard deviation: 35.2), for the cities&#13;
of the low income countries it is 23.0 (standard deviation: 18.3).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 157 -&#13;
of total trips in large African cities such as Kinshasa and Dar es Salaam&#13;
(World Bank, 1975b, p.19), walking and cycling trips accounted for 60 per-&#13;
cent of total trips (40 percent of work related trips) in Karachi, (U.S.&#13;
Agency for International Development, 1976, p.159), and in Madras "a third&#13;
of vehicles entering the central business district each day are cycles as&#13;
are more than 25% of vehicles passing a cordon some 10 miles out" (World&#13;
Bank, 1975b, p.19). In contrast, in Kingston only 16 percent of all work&#13;
trips (25 percent of school trips) are made on foot, and less than 1 percent&#13;
1/&#13;
on bicycle (Jamaica Ministry of Finance and Planning, 1978, p.2.12).&#13;
However, despite the fact that on balance non-motorized trips tend to decline&#13;
in importance with rising income and motorization (and, very probably, with&#13;
city size, although the evidence in Kingston shows that this is not necess-&#13;
arily so), the considerable variations between cities of roughly comparable&#13;
conditions are quite surprising (World Bank, 1975b, p. 20), and indicate&#13;
that neither income nor motorization levels provide a sufficient explana-&#13;
tion for differences in the share of non-motorized trips in total trip&#13;
taking in LDCs.&#13;
Turning then to an analysis of the data on the modal split of&#13;
motorized trips in LDC cities (Table V-1), one finds that the picture is&#13;
similarly complex. Looking, first, at the relationship between car owner-&#13;
ship and the share of automobile trips in total motorized trips, one finds&#13;
a relativrely low correlation coefficient (0.45)- /Furthermore, there is&#13;
1/   The same study for Kingston also showed, however, that a slight increase&#13;
has taken place in recent years in the share of walking trips, which is&#13;
attributed to the increased spreading of employment opportunities espe-&#13;
cially in the low income areas of the city.&#13;
2/   The correlation coefficients reported in this paragraph are based on&#13;
the data shown in Table V-1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 158 -&#13;
virtually no correlation between income and automobile trip share (corre-&#13;
lation coefficient: 0.13). Thus, the relationship between automobile use&#13;
and income--at least for average income levels across cities--appears a&#13;
lot less clcse than might have been expected. The correlation between&#13;
motorization (defined as the number of automobiles per thousand population)&#13;
and income levels on the one hand, and the share of bus trips in total&#13;
motorized on the other, is found to be negative, as might have been expected,&#13;
but again it is quite low (correlation coefficients: -0.34 and -0.12&#13;
respectively for motorization and income8.&#13;
These empirical findings indi.cate that motorization is positively&#13;
related to income, automobile use is positively related to motorization, and&#13;
bus use is negatively related to motorization, but that these relationships&#13;
are weakar than one might ha-re assumed.  There are clearly a number of other&#13;
intervening variables which determine automobile ownership and use, and which&#13;
may exert as strong an influence as do income and motorization. These variables&#13;
include the distribution of income, the availability, quality, and cost of&#13;
alternative modes of transport to the user, and the pattern of urban land use.&#13;
Unfortunacely, no studies appear to be available which would determine the&#13;
quantitative contribution of these variables to the urban transport patterns&#13;
found in LDC cities, although the direction of impact is clear in most cases.&#13;
However, what is important for the present analysis, is the fact that most&#13;
of the intervening variables cited above can be influenced by policy action,&#13;
particularly the availability, quality, and cost of alternative modes of&#13;
transport.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 159 -&#13;
For instance, there is little doubt that the high taxes on auto-&#13;
mobiles and gasoline in Korea have kept automobile ownership and use at a&#13;
low level relative to the average per capita income in that city&#13;
(Table V-l; see also Beesley et al., 1978). Similarly, the extremely high&#13;
import taxes on automobiles in Bogota have kept motorization and&#13;
automobile use relatively low (Table V-1). Furthermore,&#13;
Singapore's scheme to limit car use in the central business district has&#13;
led to a drastic reduction in automobile traffic in the central city and&#13;
a switch to public transport modes and to car pooling (Watson and Holland,&#13;
1978).&#13;
Case studies of urban transport in LDC cities have similarly&#13;
indieated that other factors, such as the availability--or non-availability,&#13;
as the case may be--of an efficient bus service or of alternative motorized&#13;
modes of transport, including trains, subways, mini-buses, taxis, and an&#13;
assorted set of non-conventional modes (including "jeepneys"   in Manila, and&#13;
"dolmeses" in Turkey) have had a considerable impact in shaping the&#13;
demand for urban transport.   Also, policies to reduce employment concen-&#13;
tration in central city locations have been tried although with varying&#13;
degrees of success. The Bombay "Twin-City" project has been slow to decen-&#13;
tralize employment from central Bombay (World Bank, 1976a); some efforts to&#13;
move wholesale markets, public administration facilities, and industrial&#13;
parks out of the congested city centers to locations closer to residential&#13;
1/   The degree of employment concentration   tends to be high in LDC cities.&#13;
For instance, in large Brazilian cities up to 60% of daily trip desti-&#13;
nations are in the city center (World Bank,.1978b); in Tunis, 70% of&#13;
metropolitan area jobs are located in the congested central business&#13;
district (World Bank, 1973b).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 160 -&#13;
areas have been made in Bombay, Singapore, Hong Kong, Bogota, and Salvador&#13;
l/&#13;
(Brazil), to name only a few examples. There is little evidence on the&#13;
quantitative impacts which these land use policies have had on transport&#13;
patterns, but in some cases significant shifts in transport patterns have&#13;
evidentl.y occurred (e.g., the relocation of the national and local govern-&#13;
ment administration out of the congested central business district in&#13;
2/&#13;
Bogota).&#13;
Thus the scope for urban transport policy is significant, and its&#13;
importance is overriding. This will become more evident when considering&#13;
the characteristics of transport supply, and in particular the costs&#13;
of alternative modes of urban transport.&#13;
2.        Transport Cost&#13;
The unit cost of urban transport varies primarily with the type&#13;
of transport mode which is selected, since each mode has different capital,&#13;
operating, and maintenance costs associated with it. Table V-2 summarizes&#13;
a recent effort at estimating differential transport costs according to&#13;
the mode selected, including walking, cycling, private automobil, taxi,&#13;
minibus, bus, subway, and urban commuter railway.- Of particular interest&#13;
is the last column indicating the total cost per person per mile for each mode.&#13;
1/   For Bombay, see World Bank (1976a), for Singapore and Hong Kong see Grimes&#13;
(1976), for Salvador see World Bank (1978b); the evidence for Bogota is&#13;
based on the author's observation.&#13;
2/   Ward (1976) cites evidence for London and Paris, where satellite towns&#13;
have led to considerable local employment generation, with the result&#13;
that the number of center-periphery work trips is relatively low.&#13;
3/   In this section no attempt has been made to update existing estimates&#13;
of transportation cost surveys. In most cases, therefore, cost figures&#13;
reflect price levels of the early 1970s.&#13;
4/   The report from which this table is taken emphasizes that these cost&#13;
figures are merely illustrative and will vary from city to city, and&#13;
even according to location within a city (World Bank, 1975b, p. 72).&#13;

(2) Track costs per hour, which are subject to wide variation, have been calculated on the basis of a 2,000-hour per year track utilization, infinite track life, and a 12% per year interest charge.&#13;
Figures given are for a strip one mile long and one foot wide. Urban street is assumed to cost US$240,000 and urban expressway US$1,800,000 per 12-foot lane-mile, inclusive of land and ali&#13;
services. Capacity of expressway is assumed to be 2,200 PCU per lane per hour.&#13;
(3) Maintenance costs are assumed sufficient to keep track in good condition indefinitely, and also include the costs of lighting, cleaning and traffic control. Figures are based on data collected by&#13;
Alan M. Voorhees and Associates in the Bank-financed Caracas Road User Charges Study.&#13;
(4) Vehicle operating costs, which include depreciation and interest charges, are also subject to wide variation. The 13 cents a mile for a car represents a U.S. "compact" car under relatively&#13;
favorable road conditions. Taxis are assumed to have the same costs as cars, plus drivers' wages of 70 cents an hour. Minibuses are represented by the 14-seat Hong Kong "Public Light Bus"&#13;
and costs are adapted from Richard Butler's Bus O,peration in the Colony of Hong Kong. Bus costs are assumed as in Kuala Lumpur's 40-seat buses, as calculated by Wilbur Smith and Associ-&#13;
ates. Railway operating costs, which relate to London, are supplied by London Transport. Speed reductions from 15 to 10 miles per hour are assumed to raise operating costs by 12% in the&#13;
case of cars and taxis, 15% in the case of minibuses, and 20% in the case of buses. Speed rises from 15 to 40 miles per hour are assumed to result in vehicle operating cost savings of 15%&#13;
(5) Data on footways are obtained from "Movement of Pedestrians on Footways in Shopping Streets" by S. J. Older, Traffic Engineering end Control, August 1968.&#13;
(6) Mixed traffic on urban streets are assumed to move at 15 or 10 miles per hour. Taxis are assumed to stop 1 minute, minibuses 2 minutes, and buses 3 minutes per mile traveled.&#13;
(7) Bus-on-expressway figures are based on observations on the 1-495 bus-lane leading to the New York Port Authority bus terminal, recording 597 buses in one hour. Higher rates of flow were&#13;
observed over five-minute periods. Railway passenger flows are based on conditions on Mexico City's Metro, overall average loadings are assumed to be 62 people per car compared with 16 in&#13;
London. These volumes should not be taken as maximum capacities of mass transport: passenger flows in excess of 60,000 per hour have been observed in New York and Tokyo subways,&#13;
under conditions of crush loading. Similar volumes of passengers, even all seated, could be moved by high capacity buses on exclusive lanes. Few traffic corridors generate such volumes.&#13;
(C) Metro track is assumed to cost US$8,000,000 per lane-mile, as in Mexico City. Urban railway line is assumed to be at ground level and to cost US$3,000,000 per lane-mile.&#13;

Walking is clearly the cheapest travel mode,-/ comparable only to&#13;
bicycling whose cost is 0.3 U.s. cents per person per mile. Next in line&#13;
according to unit costs are buses and urban railways, each of which have a&#13;
cost per person mile of approximately 2 U.S. cents, except on urban express-&#13;
ways where this cost drops to 1.5 U.S. cents. Minibuses are somewhat more&#13;
costly than buses according to Table V-2, but the reverse cost pattern&#13;
frequently prevails, particularly where efficiently run private mini-bus&#13;
operations run side by side with inefficiently operated public bus companies,&#13;
as far instance in Istanbul, Kuala Lumpur and Manalia.-2/ Subways and&#13;
taxis are more costly yet, ranging from 2.5 to 4.5 U.S. cents per person per&#13;
3/&#13;
mile. Finally, for cars there is a quantum leap in costs: Their cost&#13;
falls between 16.4 and 17.5 U.S. cents per person per mile, almost four&#13;
times the cost of a taxi, and some eight times the cost of a bus, and 5'&#13;
times the cost of a bicycle trip&#13;
While these figures are only illustrative, they are confirmed by&#13;
common observations of the relative cost effectiveness of alternative modes&#13;
of transport. In Bombay, for uxample, it has been observed that buses account&#13;
for two thirds of all daily passenger trips, but only for 10 percent of daily&#13;
vehicle trips, while cars account for only 18 percent of passenger trips, but&#13;
40 percent of vehicle trips (World Bank, 1976a). In Karachi, buses contribute&#13;

3/ These figures, however, do not adequately reflect one of the major problems&#13;
associated writh construction of rapid.mass transit facilities.  To quote&#13;
from World Bank (1975b, p.29), "the minimum capacity of any separate&#13;
right-of-way established for public transport is very large while costs of&#13;
construction are inevitably high. Construction costs of metros, for&#13;
instance, typically average in excess of $10 million a lane-mile and are&#13;
much higher than this where tunneling conditions are difficult." Given&#13;
thLt capital scarcity in many of the LDCs, a subway in particular is&#13;
likely to be very costly in terms of alternative investment opportunities&#13;
foregone. One may also note that the load factor assumed in Table V-2&#13;
is very high for metros and urban railways and may not be realized in&#13;
actual fact.&#13;
&#13;

55 percent of road passenger miles, but use only 17 percent of road passenger&#13;
space; for cars, the respective figures are 44 percent and 83 percent,&#13;
respectively (U.S. Agency for International Development, 1976). For&#13;
Manila, Table V-3 reflects essentially the same lopsided picture.&#13;
The fundamental factor at work is, of course, that the private&#13;
automobile, especially when carrying only one person, takes roughly nine&#13;
times more road space per passenger than do buses (World Bank, 1975b, p.26),&#13;
and cars thus require much heavier investments and maintenance in terms of&#13;
road tradk than do buses.&#13;
This aspect takes on added importance when turning one's attention&#13;
to the central problem of urban transport: congestion. Traffic congestion, as&#13;
well as air and noise pollution, are as bad, or worse, in many of the cities&#13;
1/&#13;
of developing countries as in the cities of the industrialized nations.&#13;
And while it may be argued that higher congestion and pollution levels are&#13;
acceptable in LDC cities as compared with the cities of the developed&#13;
2/&#13;
countries, there can be little doubt that the actual levels of congestion&#13;
and pollution observed in most of the large LDC cities are far beyond the&#13;
optimal levels, and, what is perhaps more important, are likely to get&#13;
worse in the years ahead.&#13;
While there are a number of reasons for the severe central city&#13;
congestion observed in many LDC cities--including the low proportion of&#13;
urban space devoted to roads, the mixture of traffic, poor traffic management,&#13;
1/ See for instance Churchill, 1972, p. 116. Garza and Schteingart (1978, p. 75)&#13;
describe the impact of pollution in Mexico City as follows: "Mexico City&#13;
is one of the most polluted cities in the world.... Approximately 60 per-&#13;
cent of the air pollution is due to the use of motor vehicles, which&#13;
annually consume 3 million cubic meters of gasoline and 400,000 cubic&#13;
meters of diesel fuel. This has produced a notable increase in chronic&#13;
respiratory and cardiovascular disease among the city's inhabitants."&#13;
2/ The reasons for this presumption are that at lower income levels, time&#13;
and environmental quality are likely to be valued less than at high&#13;
income levels (World Bank, 1975b, p.27).&#13;

urban land use patterns, topographical constraints, and the prevalence of&#13;
1/&#13;
through traffic that is channeled througli the city center--, there can be&#13;
little doubt that the use of the private automobile is a major culprit in&#13;
generating this congestion, even where the extent of motorization is still&#13;
quite low, as for instance in Karachi, Bombay, and Manila.&#13;
The effects of congestion on vehicle operating costs and in terms&#13;
of reduced travel speeds, and thus loss of time, have2been well documented.&#13;
For Central American cities in early 1970, Churchill has estimated that for&#13;
reasonable assumptions regarding the money value of time and of travel&#13;
demand elasticities, the congestion cost falls in the range of 8 to 11 U.S.&#13;
cents per person mile for an automobile whose speed is reduced to 9.3&#13;
miles per hour (m.p.h.) due to congestion. Where speed is only 7.5 m.p.h.,&#13;
the money equivalent of the loss in time is approximately 14 to 19 U.S.&#13;
2/&#13;
cents per person per per mile (Churchill, 1972, p.131).&#13;
Two further points should be made here: First, most of the costs&#13;
which are impos'.d by the additional vehicle using an urban roadway are&#13;
external to the operator, in the sense that the other road users bear most&#13;
of the additional operating costs and loss in time. The private cost of&#13;
l/   See for instance World Bank (1975b, p.21), for a discussion of these&#13;
aspects. Topographical constraints are particularly frequent in the&#13;
large cities of LDCs, as witnessed by the examples of Abidjan, Bombay,&#13;
Manila, La Paz, and Salvador and Recife (both in Brazil). The importance&#13;
of through-traffic in adding to central city congestion has been identified&#13;
in World Bank reports for Abidjan, Tunis, Manila, and a number of Brazilian&#13;
cities.&#13;
2/ The measure of congestion cost used here is one whi.,h actually reflects&#13;
the toll required to produce optimal travel speeds. See also Walters&#13;
(1968) for estimates of congestion costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 166 -&#13;
operating a vehicle d&gt;n congested urban streets therefore diverges from the&#13;
social cost, and thus inefficient use of urban streets is the rule. One of&#13;
the aims of urban transport policy should be to reduce this discrepancy&#13;
between private and social cost, for instance by charging road users the&#13;
marginal social cost of operating their vehicles. The second point to be&#13;
emphasized is that bus and commercial vehicles are more seriously affected&#13;
by congestion than are automobiles, due to the importance of labor costs in&#13;
total operating costs of buses and commercial vehicles, their lesser degree&#13;
of flexibility in terms of timing and road choice, and the importance of&#13;
losses through uncertainty in bus schedules and delivery times (World Bank,&#13;
1975b, p.27-29).&#13;
Besides choice of transport mode and level of congestion, a nunber&#13;
of other factors influence the unit cost of urban transport. Among these&#13;
are topography, city size and density, track and vehicle design, regulations&#13;
governing entry and operations of transport agents, and the quality of manage-&#13;
ment, particularly when urban transport is the responsibility of the public&#13;
sector.   The topographical constraints are usually immutable and affect&#13;
transport costs in roughly predictable fashion. The cost of urban road&#13;
provision tend, to increase with city size due to higher unit land&#13;
(and possibly labor) costs in the larger, as compared with the smaller&#13;
cities. Low density development requires a more extensive road net per&#13;
residence than does high density development. For example, a recent modeling&#13;
. exercise for a stylized, but representative intermediate-size city in Korea&#13;
indicated that for the period 1975-85 the incremental capital cost of urban&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 167 -&#13;
transport for a dispersed land use development pattern exceed the capi::al costs&#13;
for concentrated (i.e., high density) pattern by some 50 percent; the differ-&#13;
ence in recurrent (daily) cost was only 2 percent (Beesley et al9 p. 72)o&#13;
Changes in track and vehicle design can also contribute to cost&#13;
savings, although the scope is probably limited, as long as these c:-hs7-es&#13;
do not change the relative operating characteristics of different     ssort&#13;
modes, or as long as the scale of a project is not affected.  An interesting&#13;
example for the possibilities of cost saving devices is reflected in the&#13;
following statement drawn from the appraisal report for a World Bank urb.an&#13;
transport project in Brazil:&#13;
"Attempts were made to reduce the scale of any project elnlent-&#13;
whose design was based on unjustified expectations regarding&#13;
future growth, either of the urban area or of traffic. This&#13;
approach resulted in important project modifications and cost&#13;
savings.  In Curitiba, the selection of a very low-cost paving&#13;
technique cut costs by 80% on half of the feeder road program.&#13;
in Salvador, a poor area bus penetration road was cut from&#13;
the proposed four lanes to two. Overall, cost savings resulting&#13;
from reducing the standards of proposed project elements were&#13;
of the order of US$6.3 million in Salvador, US$32.0 million in&#13;
Curitiba, and US$5.8 million in Recife--a total saving of&#13;
US$45.1 million (about 15% of total project cost)."  (World&#13;
Bank, 1978b, p.17).&#13;
The cost impact of institutional and management constraints in the&#13;
transport sector are much more difficult, if not impossible, to quantify than&#13;
is the case for the factors so far described. However, this does not mean&#13;
that these elements are of lesser importance. For instance, when 40 pearcent&#13;
of the buses run by the national bus company in Tunis during 1972 experienced&#13;
daily breakdowns, the costs to the bus enterprise as well as to the riding public&#13;
were certainly considerable(World Bank, 1973b). Or, as has recently been the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 168 -&#13;
case in Recife (Brazil), when the public bus company can restrict entry by&#13;
private competitors thus limiting the availability of bus service throughout&#13;
the city, because the company itself is financially unable to extend services&#13;
beyond the present scope, considerable costs are incurred by those&#13;
individuals who either have to walk, take a taxi, or even buy a car in order&#13;
1/&#13;
to get to their place of employment (World Bank, 1978b). Restrictions on entry&#13;
by operators of private buses or other means of transportation, are quite frequent&#13;
in LDC cities, particularly where publicly run bus companies exist. And what is&#13;
2/&#13;
more, these public enterprises are frequently managed rather poorly, and may&#13;
encourage wage and benefit scales for their employees which are for above&#13;
those of private sector competitors.&#13;
3.        The Urban Transport System&#13;
Costs alone do not determine the optimal choice of travel mode or&#13;
of urban transport policy. Benefits have to be considered also, and it is&#13;
patently obvious that the use of an automobile conveys much higher benefits&#13;
under many circumstances than does the use of a bus, bicycling, or walking&#13;
on foot. Circumstances do vary, however, and they vary in particular with transport&#13;
conditions and transport policy. For instance, in a highly congested central&#13;
city a bicycle, or even walking, may provide more mobility than an automobile&#13;
stuck in a traffic jam and requiring a place to park. Also, a bus on an&#13;
exclusive bus lane may provide for faster access to employment than does an&#13;
automobile on a congested limited access expressway. The efficiency of an&#13;
urban transport system thus depends very much on the conditions under which&#13;
1/ Loss of employment or the need to pay higher rents at locations closer&#13;
to employment are other possible costs.&#13;
2/ See Roth (1973) for some examples. Of course, there are exceptions.&#13;
For instance, the public transport facilities in Bombay and the city&#13;
bus compan:' in Jakarta appear to be well run (World Bank, 1976a;&#13;
and Linn et al., 1976).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 169 -&#13;
the system operates. Since these conditions appear to vary quite systematic-&#13;
ally with city size, the following paragraphs will briefly outline a few&#13;
thoughts on the changing circumstances under which the transport system operates&#13;
as city size increases, and in particular it will focus on the changing&#13;
relative costs and benefits of alternative travel modes and related policies.&#13;
Of course, the analysis has to content itself with rather broad characteri-&#13;
zations given the large number of factors influencing demand and supply&#13;
conditions of urban transport. Also, policy prescriptions are sketched only&#13;
in very general terms. They will be treated in greater detail in the follow-&#13;
ing section.&#13;
For small cities and towns in LDCs (with less than, say, 100,000&#13;
1/&#13;
inhabitants), trip length tends to be quite short, with relatively close&#13;
proximity of employment and residential locations. Non-motorized transport&#13;
can provide sufficient mobility for most people; motorized transport is&#13;
chosen mainly for its convenience by the higher income groups or for commercial&#13;
transport although minibuses may provide a useful mode of transport to all&#13;
but the poorest in the smaller towns of middle-income countries. These&#13;
private choices of travel modes generally do not lead to&#13;
major conflicts in the use of available road space, and public investments&#13;
in urban transport facilities remain quite low. Some minor efforts of traffic&#13;
management may be required, for instance traffic lights at the few busy inter-&#13;
sections and limits on parking in the central square or on main streets to&#13;
avoid unnecessary tie-ups. In many cases, poorly managed through-traffic may&#13;
pose the major problem to urban transport in these towns, and it therefore may&#13;
deserve special attention and remedies. In any case, it is probably correct&#13;
1/   The ranges of city size given in this and the following paragraphs are&#13;
mere orders of magnitude; obviously no hard and fast line can be drawn.&#13;
See also Grimes (1976, p.47) for a similar size grouping.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 170 -&#13;
to say that urban transport does not in general require extensive policy&#13;
intervention in small cities or towns.&#13;
For intermediate-size cities (100,000 to 500,000 inhabitants) average&#13;
trip length begins to reach the level where motorized transport takes on&#13;
increased importance, especially where economic activity is highly con-&#13;
centrated, or where incomes are relatively high permitting a high degree&#13;
of car ownership and the provision of motorized public transport for the&#13;
major transport corridors. For example, San Jose (Costa Rica), Cartagena&#13;
(Colombia), Dar es Salaam (Tanzania), and Lusaka (Zambia) fall into this&#13;
general size category (see Table V-1). In those cities, traffic management&#13;
becomes a problem, particularly in the congested icty centers and&#13;
around markets and intercity transport terminals. Much of the problem is&#13;
caused by the fact that the street network of the old city centers is not&#13;
adapted to high-density motorized traffic, and by the generalLy unconstrained&#13;
driving and parking of private motor vehicles on these streets. Nevertheless,&#13;
work trips are still not significantly affected by these problems, since all&#13;
employment opportunities remain accessible within reasonable time periods&#13;
from virtually all locations in the city. This, however, does not mean that&#13;
there is no scope for a conscious urban transport policy. Greater transport&#13;
infrastructure needs arise in these cities as compared with the small towns,&#13;
1/&#13;
traffic management can be improved particularly in the central areas,    and&#13;
public transport, particularly buses, becomes an area of official intervention.&#13;
1/   E.g., by restraints on parking, by reserving certain streets for exclusive&#13;
use of public transport or of pedestrians, etc. Many European towns&#13;
falling into this size category (e.g. Munster, Germany, 350,000 inhabitants)&#13;
have in recent years taken these steps with considerable success.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 171 -&#13;
More important, however, is the fact that many of the cities falling into&#13;
this size class, particularly in Latin America, Africa, and East Asia, are&#13;
growing rapidly and will in a decade or less fall into the next larger size&#13;
grouping, where urban transport becomes a major problem for city management&#13;
unless steps have been taken early on ensuring an appropriate urban transport&#13;
1/&#13;
pattern.   The most important aspect here is the encouragement of a land use&#13;
pattern which reduces the need for lengthy commuting trips by ensuring a&#13;
balanced spread of employment opportunities as the city grows. This is, of&#13;
course, easier said than done; however, what can certainly be avoided are&#13;
the types of policies which actively encourage the spatial segregation of&#13;
2/&#13;
economic activities and residential location.&#13;
For large cities (half a million to two million inhabitants) the&#13;
average length of trips increases to the point where walking is no longer&#13;
an option for many commuters, especially when employment opportunities are&#13;
highly concentrated; congestion (and pollution) takes on more serious and&#13;
wide-spread proportions, particularly since car ownership and use is likely&#13;
to be higher in larger than in smaller cities, at least within the same&#13;
country. While cities of this size tend to be mononuclear, in the sense&#13;
that most employment opportunities are concentrated in one major cluster or&#13;
along an axis (often extending from the city center along the railway terminal),&#13;
the even larger cities (i.e., those beyond 2 million inhabitants)&#13;
are often characterized by the emergence of multi-nuclear employment&#13;
concentrations, because of spontaneous decentralization of economic&#13;
activities, such as has been observed for Bogota and Manila (World Bank,&#13;
1/ Abidjan (Ivory Coast), for instance, grew from a population of 340,000&#13;
in 1965 to 1,000,000 in 1975 (these are approximate figures due to the&#13;
absence of reliable population data for this city; see World Bank, 1976b).&#13;
2/ This appears to have been the case, for instance, in Abidjan (Ivory Coast)&#13;
(World Bank, 1976b), during much of its recent growth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 172 -&#13;
1975c) and (Lee, 1978); because of the incorporation of previously&#13;
independent urban settlements into the metropolitan area of a large and&#13;
growing city, as for instance in the case of Cali (Colombia) and, at a&#13;
1/&#13;
somewhat lesser scale still, in the case of Kingston (Jamaica); or because&#13;
of conscious government policies, such as the "cities-with-the-city" program&#13;
in Colombia, or the "Twin City" development in Bombay.&#13;
In any case, the transportation problems of large cities have&#13;
generally reached the scale where only fairly drastic policy action is likely&#13;
to cut what appears to be a Gordian Knot. In virtually all these cities,&#13;
significant limitations on the use of automobiles in congested central areas&#13;
is required.  This is particularly important in high income countries and&#13;
cities with high and rapidly increasing levels of motor vehicle ownership.&#13;
The means to achieve this goal are varied and need to be combined for&#13;
greatest impact. They include taxation of automobile ownership, area&#13;
license schemes and parking fees in the most congested locations, and&#13;
improvements in mass transit facilities, including intermediate motorized&#13;
transit modes, such as mini-buses, jitneys, and the like. In most large&#13;
cities the improvements in mass transit facilities will probably have to&#13;

into the metropolitan area; for Kingston, the previously separate urban&#13;
area of Spanish Town has now become officially part of the Kingston&#13;
Metropolitan Region.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 173 -&#13;
rely on buses (or, when already in existence, on improved surface rail&#13;
1/&#13;
transport, as e.g. in Tunis, or Bombay).    Buses have a high degree&#13;
of operational flexibility, do not require separate rights of way (or where&#13;
they do, this can relatively easily be provided on the basis of existing&#13;
streets), and may need only a minimal involvement of scarce governmental&#13;
administration and financial resources, since bus systems have shown to&#13;
be successfully operated by the private sector in a number of LDC cities&#13;
(Roth, 1973). The speed, effectiveness, and convenience of bus systems can&#13;
be significantly improved by providing reserved bus lanes, preferred treat-&#13;
ment at intersections, as well as improved terminal and loading area con-&#13;
ditions, not to mention improvements in the vehicle stock and its maintenance.&#13;
The scope for rapid transit facilities, and especially of subways,&#13;
is likely to be limited, since&#13;
''the cost of subway construction is very high; only in large&#13;
cities exceeding two million population with very high&#13;
densities providing large traffic volumes over many hours&#13;
a day and favorable tunneling conditions do subways appear&#13;
a feasible solution. Even then, the costs may only be&#13;
affordable in the richer developing countries and fares&#13;
are likely to be too high for the poorer strata of society.&#13;
Where a subway is feasible, account must be taken of the&#13;
need to reorient the whole public transport system so that&#13;
bus routes and subways complement each other." (World Bank,&#13;
1975b, p.86).&#13;
It is of particular interest, in this context, that one developing country&#13;
with a significant experience in subway construction and operation, Brazil,&#13;
appears to be emphasizing now the development of urban bus transit, rather&#13;
2/&#13;
than continuing its past focus on subways.&#13;
1/ There may also be some scope for light surface rail transport, especially&#13;
tramways; see e.g. U.S. Agency for International Development (1976), for&#13;
a discussion of this option.&#13;
2/ -See Annex A; also World Bank (1976b).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 174 -&#13;
Finally, even in large cities, increased attention should be paid&#13;
to non-motorized traffic, such as walking, bicycling, and other forms of&#13;
traditional transport. This is true especially for the cities of the low-&#13;
income countries, where these travel modes still account for sizable shares&#13;
of urban transport.   Pedestrian malls, widened sidewalks and pedestrian&#13;
overpasses, low-income neighborhood walkways and bicycle paths are among&#13;
the possible policy instruments to achieve a more effective system of non-&#13;
motorized transport.&#13;
Lest this discussion appears too removed from reality to provide practical&#13;
solutions, a brief account of the experience in Singapore may be useful.&#13;
Singapore is a city reaching 2.5 million inhabitants and a relatively high&#13;
income and motorization level (Table V-1). The government of Singapore has&#13;
pursued what is a unique example of a comprehensive, and by all standards,&#13;
efficient and effective urban transport policy (Watson and Holland, 1978).&#13;
The prime ingredients of this policy are (a) a recently introduced scheme&#13;
to relieve central city congestion by the combination of an area licensing&#13;
scheme for private automobiles and of graduated parking fees; (b) control&#13;
of motor vehicle ownership and use by various tax measures; (c) an improved&#13;
mass transit system largely based on buses; (d) various improvements in&#13;
traffic management, and (d) a long-term policy of locating employment&#13;
1/&#13;
opportunities close to new housing developments, and vice versa.    The impacts&#13;
of the congestion-relief program have been well documented and include in-&#13;
creased travel speeds for passenger and goods traffic in the center of the&#13;

city, a significant shift from the use of single-occupant cars to the use&#13;
of buses and of carpools, and reduced pollution i.evels (Watson and Holland,&#13;
1978). Singapore is, of course, exeptional in a number of respects: it is&#13;
a city state with a strong and dynamic metropolitan-wide government, with&#13;
a highly qualified staff, and a strong political commitment and popular&#13;
support for dealing with the rising congestion and environmental deterio-&#13;
ration in the city. Nevertheless, the example is worth careful study, and&#13;
replication to the extent feasible. Particular note should be taken of&#13;
various practical aspects which helped to make the policy work (Watson and&#13;
Holland, 1978; Linn, 1979):   Adequate study and preparation, including an&#13;
extensive publicity campaign; simplicity of regulation and flexibility in&#13;

implementation; pre-existence of an effective vehicle registration system;&#13;
a clear commitment to the enforcement of the scheme; and un-fettered authority&#13;
by the metropolitan government to plan and implement a comprehensive strategy&#13;
for urban transport policy.&#13;
In concluding this section attention should be drawn to the fact&#13;
that so far consideration has been given only to the efficiency of the&#13;
urban transport system. There are, however, a number of other common govern-&#13;
ment objectives which can be served by the rationalization of urban transport&#13;
in developing countries. Most of these go beyond the scope of the present&#13;
paper and will therefore only be listed very 'briefly:&#13;
1/ A good motor vehicle registration and licensiag system is crucial to&#13;
the success of a scheme designed to tax motor vehicle cQ.niership or use,&#13;
but it is also essential for the purpose of identifying and prosecuting&#13;
traffic offenders, and for curbing motor vehicle theft, which in some&#13;
LDC cities (e.g., Bogota) has reached epidemi; proportirns.   In this&#13;
respect motor vehicle taxtation is quite similar to real estate taxation,&#13;
for wdhich the existence of a good physical cadastre is essential. Tne&#13;
-adastrr. in turn serves other important purposes besides property taxation.&#13;
&#13;

(a) energy conservation: private automobiles are relatively&#13;
energy intensive and probably account for a significant&#13;
share of the increase in gasoline consumption in many LDCs;&#13;
lack of adequate data prevents a careful analysis of this&#13;
aspect, but it is worth noting that the recent policy switch&#13;
to an emphasis of bus mass transit as the answer to the&#13;
urban transportation problem in Brazil has been motivated&#13;
substantially by the objective of energy conservation&#13;
(World Bank, 1978b);&#13;
(b)  foreign exchange saving:  except for the fewv countries with&#13;
a substantial local capacity to produce cars, an unchecked&#13;
process of motorization is very costly in terms of foreign&#13;
exchange; the same holds for high-technology mass-transit&#13;
1/&#13;
systems;&#13;
(c) public resource saving: the potential for savings in public&#13;
resources by shifts in modal patterns of urban transport and&#13;
by judicious project design was extensively discussed in&#13;
this section;&#13;
(d)  employment generation:  little is known on the employment&#13;
impact of alterniative urban transport strategies, but on&#13;
balance it would appear that deemphasizing automobile owner-&#13;
ship and use in favor of public transport, especially if not&#13;

urban transport modes, see U.S. Agency for International Development&#13;

involving high-technology rapid transit facilities, will&#13;
increase employment;&#13;
(e)  regional balance:  one of the major reasons for pursuing&#13;
regional decentralization policies is the concern with&#13;
inefficiency of the largest cities; to the extent that&#13;
urban transport policy can reduce this inefficiency, this&#13;
argument for regional decentralization is weakened, while&#13;
at the same time, the elimination of effective subsidies&#13;
to som, of the urban transport users--by pricing urban&#13;
transport services at full social costs--, will make the&#13;
large city less attractive to them;&#13;
(f) equity: current urban transport policy in many LDCs&#13;
benefits the wealthy groups, particularly those owning&#13;
automobiles, while it fails to respond to the needs of the&#13;
urban poor; most of the transport policies suggested in&#13;
this section on the basis of efficiency grounds would also&#13;
improve the welfare of the urban poor; this topic is the&#13;
subject of the next section.&#13;
/   This conclusion is subject to qualifications in countries which have&#13;
already developed a substantial domestic automobile industry. Ihese&#13;
are mainly among the most advanced of the LDCs.&#13;

C. Transportation 'or the Urban Poor&#13;
The preceding section has outlined an urban transport strategy&#13;
designed to  he:rease the efficiency of urban development.  Scant attention&#13;
hias so far been paid to how these policies will affect the urban poor, or&#13;
how they can be designed to maximize the benefits which the poor can derive&#13;
from an efficient urban transport system.  Before discussing various areas&#13;
of policy action, a brief review of the role which transportation plays for&#13;
the urban poor will help in the subsequent policy analysis.&#13;
1.        The Role of Transportation fo-r the Urban Poor&#13;
Household expenditure surteys indicate that the urban poor tend to&#13;
devote on average somewhere between one and ten percent of their incomes on&#13;
1/&#13;
transportation.   These expenditure data further suggest that in cities of&#13;
low-income countries a significantly smaller percentage of incomes are spent&#13;
on transportation by urban dwellers, including the poor; for selected Indian&#13;
cities, for example, the transport share in total household spending does&#13;
not exceed 2 percent until fairly high up in the income scale. In contrast,&#13;
in Korean cities, low-income households spend up to five percent on transpotta-&#13;
tion,   Finally, the data for Peru (Thomas, 1978) indicate that the transport&#13;
expenditure share is highest in the metropolitan area of Lima (between 6 and&#13;
7 percent for the lowest 50 percent of the population), lower in the urban&#13;
areas along the Pacific Coast (between 4 and 5 percent for the lowest 50&#13;
percent of the population), and virtually insignificant in the rural regions&#13;
1/ See Grimes (1975), p.68, for data on Bogota, Hong Kong, and selected&#13;
Indian and Korean cities. See,also Thomas (1978), p.26, for data on&#13;
Peruvian cities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 179 -&#13;
of the Peruvian Sierra. These data reflect the impacts of city size on&#13;
transportation needs and of rising incomes on the willingness and ability&#13;
to pay for more transportation.&#13;
It is important, however, not to view expenditure on transporta-&#13;
tion in isolation. What is actually demanded (or needed) by the poor is&#13;
1/&#13;
access  to employment opportunities and services.    Access can be obtained&#13;
either by residing on land close to employment or services, thus requiring&#13;
little travel, or by residing f .r'her away and requiring more travel.&#13;
In the former case, what is saved in terms of transportation costs&#13;
is usually lost in terms of higher rents, and vice versa for the latter case.&#13;
Indeed, higher central-city land and rental values are in large part a&#13;
reflection of the superior access of these locations at lower transport&#13;
costs, as compared with peripheral locations. This is where city size plays&#13;
a major role, since the larger is the city, the greater tends to be the&#13;
scaroity value of central urban land, the more difficult and costly is the&#13;
provision of transport to central locations, and thus the higher are land&#13;
costs (rents). The poor have essentially three options to adjust to this&#13;
impact of city growth. First, they can settle at the periphery where land&#13;
costs remain low, but then they lose either in terms of higher transportation&#13;
costs or in terms of rekduced labor earnings due to the loss of jobs, particu-&#13;
larly for secondary income earners. Second, they can remain (or settle) at&#13;
relatively central locations and pay higher rents per household at unchanged&#13;
densities. Or third, they can accept higher densities, lower quality of&#13;

in the context of discussion of urban poverty.&#13;

- 180 -&#13;
shelter or public utilities, or greater insecurity of tenure, or all of&#13;
these combined, so as to reduce transportation costs and rental payments&#13;
combined to a level which will leave enough for the other necessities of&#13;
1/&#13;
life.&#13;
An improved urban transportation system is therefore not the only&#13;
means to improve access to employment and services for the poor; providing&#13;
cheap land close to employment opportunities (or vice versa) may be just as&#13;
important. In fact, for the poorest groups, who usually can only afford&#13;
2/&#13;
to walk, improvements in tmst forms of urban transport will not be of much&#13;
help, except to the extent that a generally improved transportation system&#13;
may reduce the scarcity value of centrally located land relative to more&#13;
peripheral locations, and may thus reduce a major item of expenditure (i.e.,&#13;
rents) for them. The importance of this "trickle-down" effect depends on&#13;
3/&#13;
the extent to which the transportation system is improved.   Minor improve-&#13;
ments obviously will not significantly affect land costs or rents throughiout&#13;
1/ The extreme case is found in the large cities of the low-income countries:&#13;
"People who sleep in the downtown streets of Karachi, Calcutta, and other&#13;
cities of South Asia often do so not because they cannot find shacks on&#13;
the Ciriphery, but because they cannot afford the cost in money or time&#13;
for daily travel to their homes. Many have dwellings on the city outskirts&#13;
and visit their fami.lies once a week." (Grimes, 1976, p.27).&#13;
2/ "The cheapest form of mass transit is the urban bus--approximately 2 US cents&#13;
per passenger per mile under conditions found in many developing countries.&#13;
A ten-mile, round-trip commute to work would cost 20 US cents per day, 5 per-&#13;
cent of income where the daily wage is US$4.00 and 20 percent where the daily&#13;
wage is US$1.00."' (Beier et al., 1975, p. 63). Clearly, few low income earners&#13;
c a n  afford to spend 20 percent of their incomes on turansport, unless they&#13;
pay no rent (e.g., because they are squatting on rent-free land).&#13;
3/ There is some, albeit highly conjectural evidence that the extensive road&#13;
construction program in Bogota (which was financed mainly by betterment&#13;
levies) combined with a well-functioning bus system and a relatively low&#13;
density of private automobile traffic has kept down the rate of growth of&#13;
land values in that city as compared with other cities in LDCs. (Doebele&#13;
et al., 1979).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 181 -&#13;
the urban area, although they may have significant impacts on land values&#13;
in the vicinity of the project which is executed.&#13;
For those low-income households which can afford to pay for bus&#13;
transportation--these may include households among the lowest 20 percent&#13;
in the cities of the middle-income countries, but will include only few&#13;
even among the lowest 40 percent in the cities of low-income countries--,&#13;
an improvement in the bus system will lead to some improvements in their&#13;
living condition, although the extent to which this is the case will vary&#13;
depending on a number of circumstances. The improvements may involve a&#13;
reduction in travel times or costs, the opening up of new employment oppor-&#13;
tunities, or the opportunity to locate on cheaper land, which was previously&#13;
not accessible due to lack of transportation. In addition, nowever, some&#13;
of the benefits may be shared by others, among them the land owners whose&#13;
land is increased in value due to improved accessibility; transport service&#13;
operators; employers; renters elsewhere in the city; and consumers of the&#13;
products which are produced by the activities, whose accessibility is&#13;
1/&#13;
increased.   Under most circumstances it is very difficult, if not impossible&#13;
to determine precisely the incidence of urban transport service&#13;
provision, but as long as product markets are reasonably competitive&#13;
on a national scale, and urban transport service operators are competitively&#13;
organized, much of the benefit of improved transportation is likely&#13;
to go to land owners and transport users. In order to ensure the beneficial&#13;

in a discussion of the benefit incidence of urban transport services.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 182 -&#13;
poverty impact of urban bus transport improvements, it is therefore not&#13;
sufficient to attempt to channel the resources in such a way that relatively&#13;
poor users are affected by the provision of transport; consideration must&#13;
also be given to the extent to which land ownership is distributed in the&#13;
neighborhoods most directly benefitting from the improvements. Improved&#13;
transport access to poor neighborhoods where the poor rent predominantly&#13;
and land is largely owned by rich individuals will involve some "leakages"&#13;
of benefits to the rich; in contrast, transport improvements to areas where&#13;
the poor are effectively in possession of the land--even if they do not legally&#13;
own it--will channel many of the benefits to the poor. The distribution of land&#13;
ownership is thus an important aspect in determining the incidence of benefits&#13;
from transport projects, particularly where these affect relatively well&#13;
1/&#13;
defined areas.&#13;
More expensive modes of urban transportation, especially subways&#13;
and automobiles are likely to be beyond the reach of the poor in most of the&#13;
2/&#13;
developing countries, but especially in low-income Asia and Africa. What is&#13;
1/ Quantitative estimates of the distribution of urban transport investments&#13;
between transport users and land owners do not appear to exist. However,&#13;
it is relevant to note that the "valorization" scheme in Colombian cities,&#13;
which successfully recovers much of the costs of urban road construction&#13;
in these cities by charges on land owners in areas adjacent to road improve-&#13;
ment projects, would indicate that a substantial portion of the benefit&#13;
from such investments is in fact reaped by the land owners. If this were&#13;
not the case, it would obviously be much more difficult to make this&#13;
financing schenme work.&#13;
2/  "To judge by the recent experience in Mexico City and preliminary estimates&#13;
elsewhere, fares will need substantially to exceed 10 cents for an average&#13;
trip of two or three miles if full costs are to be covered--even where very&#13;
high density traffic is encountered." (World Bank, 1975b, p. 84).&#13;
Thus, unless high subsidies are offered to subway users, the low income groups&#13;
cannot be expected to pay for the fares; and if subsidies are given, then these&#13;
will be spread very widely, since subway users tend to come from virtually all&#13;
income groups (Zahavi, 1976, p.69).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 183 -&#13;
more, the heavy investments required in providing transport facilities for&#13;
these modes reduce the availability of funds to improve the transportation&#13;
system in ways which reach the poor directly. The World Bank's Urban&#13;
Transport Sector Policy Paper phrased this point succinctly for the case&#13;
of automobiles:&#13;
"Comfort, convenience and speed of total (automobile) trips&#13;
are so much greater than for other modes as to represent a&#13;
quantum difference. The independence and liberty of movement&#13;
they provide represent an emancipation for many owners; hence,&#13;
the great appeal and tenacity with which their use is defended.&#13;
However, in terms of road space and total costs to the commu-&#13;
nity their benefits are provided at very high cost. In&#13;
developing countries, so long as resources available for infra-&#13;
structure are so limited, the benefits of the few in automobiles&#13;
using roads at peak hours are inevitably accompanied by inten-&#13;
sified difficulties for many traveling by public transport,&#13;
walking or cycling." (World Bank, 1975b, p.87)&#13;
Putting the same matter in somewhat different terms, one may conclude that&#13;
the common response to increased congestion caused by the growing numbers&#13;
of automobiles--i.e., investment in more and costlier roads to serve these&#13;
cars and the failure to price automobile use at social costs--, has meant&#13;
that high-income automobile owners have derived the benefits not only of the&#13;
fiscal dividend provided to them by these investments, but also the benefits&#13;
of implicit subsidies,since they do not bear the full marginal social cost&#13;
of automobile operation. At the same time, this urban transport policy has&#13;
withheld from the remainder of the urbar1 population the benefits of the&#13;
fiscal dividend derived from public investment in urban transportation.&#13;
Moreover, non-automobile users have suffered welfare losses from the external&#13;
costs (congestion and pollution) generated by the automobile users. Indeed,&#13;
it is not uncommon that those modes which are relatively efficient and benefit&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 184 -&#13;
the poor urban groups are labeled a nuisance, and are blamed for the ills of&#13;
1/&#13;
the urban transportation systems in LDC cities.    Given this definition of&#13;
the problem, it should come as no surprise that urban transport policies are&#13;
frequently quite misguided.&#13;
An urban transport policy which is concerned with efficiency and&#13;
poverty alleviation should therefore aim to eliminate the subsidies for auto-&#13;
mobile users and shift the benefits of the fiscal dividend to other urban&#13;
transport users by a combination of investment, pricing and regulatory policies&#13;
which will briefly be summarized in the remainder of this section. Since all&#13;
major aspects of urban transport policy will be covered as succinctly as&#13;
possible, a separate summary of policy implications is not required for this&#13;
chapter.&#13;
2.        Transportation Policy for the Urban Poor&#13;
For each of the major areas of policy action--investment, pricing,&#13;
regulation--the proposed policies will be contrasted with those commonly found&#13;
in the cities of developing countries. The differences are significant and&#13;
2/&#13;
the changes in policy perceptions required are extensive.    Such changes&#13;
obviously cannot be expected to come overnight, but have to be carefully argued&#13;
and motivated on the grounds that they convey a wide range of benefits in terms&#13;
1/ The elimination of bekjas from central Jakarta is an example of the&#13;
resulting policy (World Bank, 1975b). Another example is the concern&#13;
in Manila with the impact of "jeepneys", low-cost passenger transport&#13;
vehicles and repeated consideration to curb their operations (World&#13;
Bank, 1975c; Roth, 1973).&#13;
2/  As pointed out previously, cities in the industrialized countries share&#13;
many of the same problems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
185 -&#13;
1/&#13;
of many of the common goals of government policy.    Some of the changes are&#13;
2/&#13;
already occurring in some countries and cities, but much remains to be done&#13;
in the majority of LDC cities to come to grips with the deterioration of&#13;
their urban transport system. In particular, since the urban transport sector&#13;
represents a highly interconnected system of competing and complementary&#13;
activities, it is particularly important to design a comprehensive strategy&#13;
covering as many as possible of the policy actions listed below.&#13;
a. Investment Policies&#13;
Common investment policies have involved:&#13;
- highway construction to meet the needs of the private auto-&#13;
mobile explosion;&#13;
- high-technology rapid transit in a few cities (Mexico City,&#13;
Buenos Aires, Sao Paulo);&#13;
- neglect of bus, commuter train, bicycling and walking faci-&#13;
lities;&#13;
- neglect of access roads for low-income neighborhoods, shutting&#13;
them off from access to many complementary services;&#13;
- encouragement of segregated land use, including the relocation&#13;
of slum dwellers to peripheral locations (Abidjan, Manila,&#13;
Rio de Janeiro);&#13;
1/ For a listing of these goals see the end of the preceding section.&#13;
2/ The recent switch in urban transport policy in Brazil has been mentioned,&#13;
as has been the show-case example of Singapore. Transport policy in&#13;
Bogota has also had its progressive aspects (the extensive use of betterment&#13;
levies, high taxes on automobiles, elimination of A planned limited-access&#13;
highway, gradual elimination of subsidies on gasoline, employment decentral-&#13;
ization, introduction of reserved bus lanes, etc.). Other examples could&#13;
be cited for instance for the. cities where the World Bank has financed urban&#13;
transport projects (Tunis, Kuala Lumpur, Bombay, Abidjan).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 186 -&#13;
1/&#13;
Proposed investment policies include:&#13;
- reduced emphasis on general-purpose arterial road&#13;
construction benefiting mainly automobiles;&#13;
-  extremely cautious evaluation of any plans for modern-&#13;
technology, rapid-transit investment, especially for&#13;
subways; only for the largest cities in the most advanced&#13;
countries might these options be desirable in terms of&#13;
the efficiency of the urban transport system or in terms&#13;
2/&#13;
of benefitting the urban poor;&#13;
-  emphasis on improved existing mass-transport facilities,&#13;
especially buses; this would involve the provision of an&#13;
improved stock of vehicles and good repair facilities; of&#13;
reserved bus lanes and preferential treatment of public&#13;
transport at intersections; of bus loading bays, shelters&#13;
and terminals;&#13;
-  neighborhood streets paving ?rograms, especially in the&#13;
poorer neighborhoods; this should involve especially bus&#13;
penetration routes which can provide access also to other&#13;
service vehicles (fire engines, public utility maintenance&#13;
3/&#13;
crews, garbage collection, etc.,);&#13;
1/ Most of these policies are currently pursued in the World Bank's Urban&#13;
Transport Projects.&#13;
2/  In Bogota, a lively political debate is in progress regarding the possibla&#13;
construction of a subway. Some five years ago a careful transport study&#13;
carried out in that city concluded that a subway would not be the most&#13;
appropriate way to solve Bogota's transport problems (Republic of Colombia-&#13;
IBRD-UNDP, 1973).&#13;
3/ For a project emphasizing this component in Brazil, see World Bank (1978b).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 187 -&#13;
- support for bicycle and pedestrian traffic, including&#13;
bicycle path, sidewalk and foot path construction,&#13;
pedestrian pass-overs for busy arterial roads, and&#13;
pedestrian malls in central city areas;&#13;
- reduction of standards in road construction and other&#13;
publicly provided transport facilities, wherever it does&#13;
not significantly reduce the benefits derived especially&#13;
-/&#13;
by the poor users;&#13;
-  efforts to decentralize employment location close to low-&#13;
income residential neighborhoods, such as "flatted factories"&#13;
in Singapore and Hong Kong (Grimes, 1976, p.106), public&#13;
administration facilities in Bombay? and Bogota, and other&#13;
examples previously cited.&#13;
Investment policies such as these can provide considerable benefits&#13;
to the poor. For a recent World Bank transportation project in three Brazilian&#13;
cities it has been estimated that the percentage of the investment which is&#13;
expected to generate benefits for the poor is 87 percent for Salvador, 69 percent&#13;
for Curitiba, 64 percent for Recife (World Bank, 1978b, p.43). Obviously, these&#13;
measures are very rough and do not necessarily reflect the final incidence of&#13;
benefits, but they provide a rough order of magnitude of what is achievable&#13;
with careful urban project design.&#13;
1/ The cost savings in selected Brazilian cities were cited above; Grimes&#13;
(1976, p.17) also cites examples of low-standard streets and paths&#13;
constructed and maintained without public assistance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 188 -&#13;
The relative emphasis on the different components of the proposed&#13;
investment strategy will vary between countries and cities, depending mainly&#13;
on income levels.  In the wealthier cities, particularly among the middle-&#13;
income countries, an emphasis on urban bus (and rail, where existing already)&#13;
services is quite appropriate, while in the cities of the low-income countries,&#13;
and especially the poorer cities among them, an emphasis on improved bicycle&#13;
and pedestrian traffic, coupled with a well-focused decentralization of employ-&#13;
1/&#13;
ment opportunities, would be most appropriate.&#13;
b. Pricing Policies&#13;
Common pricing policies include:&#13;
- underpricing of private automobile use in congested and&#13;
polluted central city areas; indeed, in some cities (e.g.,&#13;
in Cali, Colombia) central city parking facilities are&#13;
expressly subsidized by local tax exemptions (Linn, 1979),&#13;
Bombay (World Bank, 1976a), Istanbul (World Bank, 1972a),&#13;
Tunis (World Bank, 1973b), Beunos Aires, Calcutta, Caracas&#13;
(Roth, 1973); a particular problem is the failure to change&#13;
2/&#13;
fares regularly in line with inflating costs; also, in some&#13;
cities, fares do not vary with distance traveled, e.g., in&#13;
Bogota (Linn, 1976b), and in Korean cities (Beesley et al.,&#13;
1978).&#13;
l/  For example, for Salvador (Brazil) it has been estimated that "the urban&#13;
poor constitute 82% of bus riders but, because they tend to make longer&#13;
trips, receive 92% of all time savings." (World Bank, 1978b, p.42). For&#13;
Calcutta, or Jakarta--although no hard figures are available--the percentages&#13;
are lilkely to be a lot lower.&#13;
2/  In Manila, between 1960 and 1975 bus fares were changed only in 1960 and 1969&#13;
(World Bank, 1975a); in Kuala Lumpur fares were not changed between 1953 and&#13;
1975 (World Bank, 1976c); in Tunis, no change occurred between 1967 and 1975&#13;
(World Bank, 1973b); in Cairo, no change had been made between 1952 and 1978&#13;
(World Bank, 1978c).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 189 -&#13;
- taxation of public transport vehicles by national and&#13;
local governments, in particular buses; an extreme example&#13;
for this practice until recently existed in Kuala Lumpur,&#13;
where a bus seat tax accounted for more than 10 percent of&#13;
annual expenditures of the city's bus companies (World Bank,&#13;
1/&#13;
1976c);&#13;
Proposed pricing policies include:&#13;
- congestion pricing for private automobiles, following in&#13;
essence the example of Singapore by applying a combination&#13;
of time-and area-specific license charges, and of central&#13;
city parking fees, including not only on-street and public&#13;
off-street parking, but also private off-street parking&#13;
facilities; any tax advantages given to private parking&#13;
facilities should be eliminated;&#13;
-  taxation of automobile use and ownership which is not area-&#13;
or time-specific (fuel taxes, import taxes, genieral license&#13;
fees, etc.,) is a second best answer to the urban&#13;
congestion problem; it does, however, serve other&#13;
policy objectives, in particular since it raises public&#13;
revenues in a progressive fashion; also, there exists some&#13;
leeway to apply higher general taxes on automobile use and&#13;
ownership in large cities, as compared with smaller towns&#13;
,/ rexamples are found in Korean, Indian, and Colombian cities (Linn,&#13;
L~~.. ..&#13;

- cost recovery of public road investments through betterment&#13;

demonstrated at.least for the case of Colombia, where the&#13;
so-called "valorization" charges have financed substantial&#13;
portions of the urban infrastructure investment, and&#13;
3/&#13;
especially road construction in the large cities; this tax&#13;
scheme was particularly successful in providing improved&#13;
streets in poorer neighborhoods, while recovering at least&#13;
part of the costs and thus facilitating replicability of&#13;
4/&#13;
the program;&#13;
1/ See Linn (1979) for a discussion of the issues and experiences relating&#13;
to automotive taxation in LDC cities.&#13;
2/  For Karachi an effort was made to estimate the tax component of capital&#13;
and operating costs for various types of transport modes (U.S. Agency for&#13;
International Development, 1976, p. 184/5). The wide range in tax rates does&#13;
not appear to permit any obvious rational explanation.&#13;
3/ For a recent evaluation of this tax scheme in Bogota see Doebele et al. (1979);&#13;
similar schemes were in operation in various Latin American countries,&#13;
albeit with less success (Macon and Mafion, 1977).&#13;
4/ Another system of financing urban infrastructure investments, including&#13;
road construction, is the "land readjustment" scheme in Korea. For a&#13;
recent description and evaluation see Doebele and Hwang (1978); see also&#13;
Chapter VI below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 191 -&#13;
- careful evaluation of bus fares with a view to eliminate&#13;
wide-spread subsidization, introducing distance-graduated&#13;
1/&#13;
tariffs, and allowing flexibility over time, in making&#13;
more frequent, but less drastic adjustments to keep fares&#13;
in line with costs during inflationary periods.&#13;
The difficulty of implementing the recommended changes in pricing&#13;
po._icies must, however, be explicitly recognized. Urban transport pricing&#13;
policies, in particular the imposition of congestion charges and elimination&#13;
of public transport subsidies, are highly visible policy measures, which have&#13;
a wide range of impacts, both positive and negative, on many urban dwellers.&#13;
The impacts are reinforced by the fact that substantial losses (as well as&#13;
gains) may be sustained in the short term as a result of capitalization of&#13;
higher charges into the value of fixed assets (especially land). Optimal&#13;
employment and residential patterns may change rather swiftly as a result&#13;
of significant changes in transport prices, while firms, as well as individuals,&#13;
tend to be locked into their existing locations at least over the short term&#13;
and may face considerable transactions costs in relocation. As a result of&#13;
all these factors, transport pricing policy is very much in the political arena&#13;
and drastic changes may fail to be implemented because of well orchestrated&#13;
lobbying efforts--this is the case for congestion charges--, or they may lead&#13;
to highly disruptive popular reactions, such as strikes, street violence,&#13;
and the like. The only way to deal with these problems is by&#13;
combining changes in pricing policies with other urban transport policies;&#13;
1/ In a number of LDC cities (e.g., Bombay, Tunis, and Manila) graduated bus&#13;
fares are actually in use, showing that this practice poses no undue&#13;
administrative difficulties.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 192 -&#13;
especially by improving significantly the scope and quality of mass-transit&#13;
services, by a well-focused publicity campaign linking the costs of a new&#13;
transport pricing scheme very directly to the benefits derived from improved&#13;
services, and, if necessary, by gradually phasing in the pricing changes,&#13;
thus permitting individuals to minimize the transition costs that inevitably&#13;
arise.&#13;
A particularly troublesome and recurring problem in transport pricing&#13;
I/&#13;
is the question of subsidies for mass transit. The efficiency case for&#13;
subsidies of mass transit is based on the view that the absence of congestion&#13;
charges heavily favors the use of the private automobile. However, it is&#13;
well known that mass-transit subsidies are distinctly a second-best alter-&#13;
2/&#13;
native to congestion pricing.    What is more important, particularly in&#13;
developing countries, the public resource shortage generally does not permit&#13;
large-scale subsidization, with the result that subsidized transport systems&#13;
are underfinanced and tend to become decapitalized, thus resulting in a lower&#13;
3/&#13;
scope and quality of service.    Once this happens, it becomes very difficult&#13;
to raise fares, not only because those benefiting from the subsidies will&#13;
object to the loss of a "free ride", but also because in the eyes of the user&#13;
1/ The case of mass transit subsidies is dealt with at some length here also&#13;
because it involves a set of arguments typically arising in the context&#13;
of subsidies for all public services. This discussion therefore sets the&#13;
stage for an evaluation of subsidies for other services further below.&#13;
2/ See for instance Churchill(1972), Gomez-Ibafiez (1975), Roth (1973),&#13;
Walters (1969), World Bank (1975b).&#13;
31 Another implication of mass transit subsidies is that they encourage low&#13;
density development and urban sprawl, which in turn tends to increase&#13;
the cost of providing many urban services, including transport (see the&#13;
preceding section).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 193 -&#13;
the service quality is so low as not to deserve higher payments.&#13;
The equity argument for subsidized bus rides, which would hold that&#13;
low-income groups ought to receive income supplements through subsidized&#13;
transport, also has important limitations. First, there is the question of&#13;
static incidence: a substantial portion of subsidies may "leak" to wealthy&#13;
land owners, transport operators, employers, or to the general consumer, as&#13;
was discussed earlier. Second, the poor, especially in low Income countries,&#13;
frequently cannot afford to pay even for subsidized mase transit and thus do not&#13;
benefit from the subsidy. Furthermore, especially in the case of subways, many&#13;
middle- and higher income groups also use mass-transit facilities (Zahavi, 1976),&#13;
thus further reducing the poverty impact of mass-transit subsidies. Last, and not&#13;
least, the impact of subsidies on the scope and quality of service tends to cut the&#13;
benefits which a subsidized mass-transit system can convey to the urban poor.&#13;
Those excluded from the service because of decapitalization lose not only the&#13;
subsidy, but also the fiscal dividend of mass-transit, thus suffering doubly.&#13;
The strength of these equity-related arguments against subsidies depends,&#13;
however, on a number of factors, most importantly the level of income in the&#13;
country or city. In middle-income countries all except the very poorest groups&#13;
can afford some form of mass-transit at reasonably small subsidies, and&#13;
general tax resources may be more readily available to maintain a widely&#13;
1/&#13;
spread service network   especially for bus service.    Subsidies thus may well&#13;
reach down quite far in the income distribution without overly deleterious&#13;
effects on the efficiency of the transport system. In the low-income countries,&#13;
1/ See for instance the Brazilian examples previously cited.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 194 -&#13;
and cities, on the other hand, a large proportion of the poor cannot afford&#13;
even subsidized transport; furthermore, financial resources tend to be very&#13;
scarce, and thus the mass transit system is bound to suffer. The net impact&#13;
tends to be that subsidies do not reach the poor and that the mass-transit&#13;
system loses passengers at both ends of the income scale because of declinz.ng&#13;
services: At the high end in the income scale people switch to automobiles&#13;
or intermediate forms of motorized traffic (jeepneys, minibuses, etc.),&#13;
thus increasing congestion and lowering the efficiency of the transport system;&#13;
at the lower end of the income scale people drop out (or are never served in&#13;
the first -lace) because services in old-established city neighborhoods have&#13;
to be cut (or because they are not provided in newly established areas).&#13;
c.  tegulation&#13;
Commonly found regulatory practices include:&#13;
- restriction on entry for privately operated transit modes,&#13;
1/&#13;
such as buses, mini-buses, jitneys, rikshaws or "bekjas";&#13;
- regulation of routes, timetables, and safety of mass-transit&#13;
vehicles, but these are usually poorly enforced;&#13;
- control of fares on privately operated trr.nsit modes at&#13;
levels which do not permit maintenance of vehicles, bus&#13;
routes and service quality;&#13;
1/ This is done frequently in order to protect public mass-transit companies&#13;
from unwanted competition by private operators, as for instance in&#13;
Calcutta (Roth, 1975), or Recife (World Bank, 1978b); or in order to&#13;
protect motorized traffic from being interfered with by non-motorized&#13;
vehicles, as was the case in Jakarta where man-powered cycle-taxis&#13;
("bekjas") were banned from central city streets (World Bank, 1975b).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 195 -&#13;
no significant controls on the operation of the private&#13;
automobile in congested city areas, and no significant&#13;
controls that would favor the operation of mass-transit&#13;
modes or non-motorized transport&#13;
Recommended policies include:&#13;
- limiting the operation and parking of private automobiles&#13;
1/&#13;
in congested areas and giving other traffic modes preferred&#13;
2/&#13;
treatment by providing reserved lanes for buses and jitneys,&#13;
and by restricting certain streets or areas for exclusive&#13;
use of non-motorized traffic, as has been done for instance,&#13;
in some Brazilian cities (World Bank, 1978b), and, of course,&#13;
in a number of Western-European cities and towns;&#13;
- a review of all regulatory practices affecting the entry and&#13;
operation of buses, jitneys, etc., withi the goal of easing&#13;
3/&#13;
constraints on entry, and a stricter enforcement of safety&#13;
4/&#13;
and operating regulations;&#13;
- a review of fare regulations commonly found where mass-transit&#13;
services are provided by private operators with the objective&#13;
1/ On very busy through-streets a total ban on day-time parking is likely to be&#13;
preferable to parking charges (Churchill, 1972).&#13;
2/ This practice is beginning to gain a substantial amount of acceptance, as&#13;
the experience with urban transport projects in the World Bank has shown.&#13;
3/ A recent decision to permit the operation of mini-buses in Kuala Lumpur led&#13;
to the operation of some 100 such vehicles within 9 months (World Bank, 1976c).&#13;
4/ See Roth (1973) for arguments in favor of this recommendation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-196 - .&#13;
to provide these operators with incenitives to expand&#13;
1/&#13;
their services in line with the growth of a city; the&#13;
arguments here are parallel to those put forwTard abU%f in&#13;
the context of discussing mass-transit subsidies.&#13;
d. Complementary Policies&#13;
There are a number of additional policy measures which do not&#13;
fall squarely under the three headings of investment, pricing and regulatior,&#13;
but which must be considered in pursuing an urban transport strategy&#13;
designed to increase the efficiency of the transport system as a whole, as&#13;
well as for the poor. They are briefly listed in concluding this section:&#13;
- Staggered working hours may help relieve high peaks of&#13;
congestion and public transport utilization and thus reduce&#13;
the need for costly investment in peak-related capacity;&#13;
higher peak fares for mass-transit can work in the same&#13;
direction. However, the impact of these measures is not&#13;
likely to be very large, especially where the urban transport&#13;
system operates under conditions of excess demand for much&#13;
of the day anyhow, as is often the case in LDC cities (World&#13;
Bank, 1975b).&#13;
1/ The contrast between national government controls on bus fares in Korea and&#13;
Brazil, to cite two examples, are striking. In Korea, equal fares were until&#13;
recently imposed throughout all cities irrespective of cost differentials, which&#13;
have been estimated to be quite substantial (Beesley et al., 1978). In Brazil,&#13;
regulated bus fares are computed on the basis of "formulae (with different&#13;
coefficients for each metropolitan area and vehicle category), which take&#13;
into account operating and administrative costs, depreciation, load factor&#13;
and allows for a reasonable rate of return (12%) on companies' investment.&#13;
Fares are recomputed twice a year." (World Bank, 1978b, p.10).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 197 -&#13;
- Mini-buses and fringe parking may be useful complements to a&#13;
a policy of control on automobile use in central cities;&#13;
in Salvador (Brazil) such a scheme was very successful&#13;
(World Bank, 1975b), but it did not get much usage in&#13;
Singapore (Watson and Holland, 1978).&#13;
- Nationalization of mass-transit facilities, especially of&#13;
urban bus services is not likely to lead to improved service&#13;
provision in most circumstances (Roth, 1973, World Bank,&#13;
1975b); while there exist a few examples of successful&#13;
public urban bus companies (Bombay, Jakarta), the over-&#13;
whelming experience appears to be that private operators&#13;
can provide bus services cheaply and efficiently, even under&#13;
the most adverse of circumstances, which are frequently&#13;
generated by public action (e.g., taxation and fare regula-&#13;
tion); Kuala Lumpur is a good example in point (World Bank,&#13;
1976c);&#13;
- Improved credit facilities for the purchase of public transport&#13;
vehicles, including non-motorized vehicles, such as rikshaws&#13;
-/&#13;
and bekjas;&#13;
/  A successful experiment was conducted in Hyderabad, where commercial&#13;
banks were encouraged to lend to rikshawq operators for the purchase of&#13;
vehicles (Cousins, 1977).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 198 -&#13;
11&#13;
- Improved management, accounting, automobile registration&#13;
-:.id enforcement of regulations are essential elements in&#13;
an effort to rationalize urban transport and ensure that&#13;
improved services are provided to the poor. This will&#13;
often require increased staff training for the public&#13;
authorities in charge of managing urban transport, some&#13;
investment in complementary capital items (such as tow-&#13;
trucks, communications equipment, etc.,.), and some increases&#13;
in staffing. The apparent success of a city such as Jakarta&#13;
in many of terese areas (especially vehicle registration,&#13;
vehicle tax collection, and management of a public bus&#13;
company; see Linn, 1979) would tend to indicate that&#13;
improvements should be feasible in many other cities, too.&#13;
- Comprehensive urban transport sector planning and adminis-&#13;
tration and its integration into overall urban land-use&#13;
planning and implementation are essential. The systems-&#13;
nature of urban transportation requires a comprehensive&#13;
approach relating to all major modes and policy instruments.&#13;
The fragmentation of responsibility of the transport sector&#13;
among many public institutions, which prevails in most LDC&#13;
cities often prevents comprehensive action. The successful&#13;
1/ The national company providing bus services in Tunis for some time&#13;
extended substantial subsidies to users without realizing this, because&#13;
it had failed to allow for depreciation and other non-operating expen-&#13;
ditures in its accounting practice (World Bank, 1973b).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 199 -&#13;
design and implementation of a comprehensive urban&#13;
transport policy in Sinigapore must in no small measure&#13;
be attributed to the relatively clear assignment of&#13;
public responsibility for urban transport in that city.&#13;
Finally, the need to put transport planning and policy&#13;
in the context of wider land-use planning considerations&#13;
derives, of course, from the close complementary rela-&#13;
tionship which urban transport has with residential,&#13;
employment, and public service location decisions.&#13;
Public policy planning in these areas should always&#13;
consider the implications for the transportation system;&#13;
vice versa, urban transport strategy must explicitly&#13;
deal with its relationship to, and impacts on public&#13;
and private decisions regarding residential, employment,&#13;
and service location.&#13;

VI. URBAN HOUSING: LAND, SERVICES, AND SHELTER&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
Housing is here defined to include not only the shelter structure,&#13;
but also the lot on which the shelter stands, and the services which are&#13;
provided to the lot, such as water and energy supply, waste disposal,&#13;
drainage, ard fire and police protection. Substantial portions of household&#13;
budgets are spent on housing and related services, not only among&#13;
wealthy, but also among poor households (Tables VI-1 and VI-2). The&#13;
average propensity to spend on hous-ing generally falls somewhere between&#13;
15 and 25 percent (Churchill and Lycette, 1978), although this may be&#13;
lower in some countries (especially India), and may vary considerably&#13;
between and within income groups.-/ The importance of housing in LDCs&#13;
is further demonstrated by the fact that on average about 4 percent of&#13;
GDP is devoted to new residential construction in selected LDCs, or&#13;
21 percent of fixed capital formation and 37 percent of total construction&#13;
(Table VI-3). As with household expenditures, the importance of housing&#13;
in national income and investment figures varies widely between countries&#13;
and there are serious data problems, especially because housing investments&#13;
in slums and squatters areas are not likely to be adequately represented&#13;
1/ Estimating household expenditures on housing is inherently difficult for&#13;
a number of reasons, including the difficulty of separating investment&#13;
from recurrent expenditures, and the difficulty of estimating imputed&#13;
rents for owner-occupants and squatters. Therefore, the figures shown&#13;
in Tables VI-1 and VI-2 should merely be taken as indicative of the&#13;
general order of magnitude.&#13;

in Table VI-3. Unfortunately, the data base is too small to permit any&#13;
conclusions regarding differences in housing expenditures and investments&#13;
across country groupings.l/&#13;
Clearer cut is the distinction which may be drawn between rural&#13;
and urban areas in terms of the importance of housing. The average&#13;
propensity to spend on housing tends to be significantly higher in&#13;
urban as compared with rural areas, as is shown in Table VI-4 by way&#13;
of example for the case of Peru. In Peru, and ver- likely elsewhere,&#13;
this difference applies for all households, as well as for the households&#13;
among the lowest 40 percent. But there are other reasons why housing is&#13;
of particular concern in urban as compared with rural areas (Churchill&#13;
and Lycette, 1978): Higher urban than rural population growth rates,&#13;
worsening health and environmental conditions in urban areas, the greater&#13;
need for public involvement in supporting urban as compared with rural&#13;
housing development, and the great concentration, visibility and political&#13;
urgency of inadequate urban housing, as compared with the scattered&#13;
and less apparent problems of rural housing.&#13;
Indeed, the urban housing problem is probably the most visible&#13;
aspect of the difficulties which LDCs face in their process of transition&#13;
from rural to urbanized economies, and from traditional to modern societies.&#13;
Sprawling shanty towns, slums, or squatter areas, dilapidated shelter&#13;
structures patched together from scraps of card board, corrugated iron,&#13;
1/ For instance, the higher average proportion of residential construction&#13;
in GDP found for Europe, the Middle East and North Africa is explained&#13;
by the fact that three countries (Greece, Israel, and Cyprus) have&#13;
shares much higher than the remaining countries.&#13;

wood and sometimes bricks, an appalling lack of basic services such&#13;
as safe water supply, sanitation, and drainage -- all these prob&amp;ems&#13;
are patently obvious for anybody living in, or visiting the cities in&#13;
LDCs. tQuite clearly, a drastic need for improvement exists, but what&#13;
is an appropriate way to deal with the urban housing problem in LDCs?&#13;
In fact, a prior question to be answered is how this problem is to be&#13;
defined.&#13;
Accordingly, this chapter first presents an overview of the&#13;
urban housing sector in LDCs (Section B) by discussing the major aspects&#13;
of housing demand and supply, and their interactions which produce the&#13;
symptoms of the urban housing problem typically observed in LDCs. On the&#13;
basis of this analysis, it is possible to define the housing problem in&#13;
LDC cities and suggest a strategy which can assist in reducing the problem&#13;
(Section C). To summarize the essence of the argument, it is concluded&#13;
that the constraint on urban housing lies not in the limits on the demand&#13;
side, but rather in the inadequate response on the supply side, an inadequacy&#13;
which is largely induced by mistaken policies and is therefore subject&#13;
to remedies through correct policy actions. Section D then presents a&#13;
review of some of the experiences gathered in the preparation and&#13;
implementation of urban development projects finL'.nced by the World Bank&#13;
as a test for the feasibility fo the proposed strategy.&#13;
B. The Urban Housing Sector&#13;

is best carried out by fir3t investigating the nature and determinants of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

demand for, and supply of housing respectively, and by then considering&#13;
the interactions of demand and supply and the resulting symptoms of the&#13;
urban housing problem.&#13;
1. The Demand for Urban Housing&#13;
a. Housing Attributes and Preference Patterns&#13;
The demand for housing reflects the willingness to pay for a&#13;
set of attributes or services which are provided by the physical&#13;
components of lot and housing structure. The most important of these&#13;
attributes are access, space, tenure, on-site services, and shelter.&#13;
Access defines the accessibility of employment opportunities, of&#13;
off-site services such as health and education facilities, atd of&#13;
community contacts. Access is important because it permits a household&#13;
the opportunity of earning an income, of benefiting from social services,&#13;
and of enjoying community relationships with culturally and socially&#13;
compatible neighbors. These locational advantages and thus the value&#13;
of a particular lot may be affected by changes in the transportation&#13;
system, by the (re-)location of employment opportunities and social&#13;
service facilities, and by changes in the cultural and social balance&#13;
of the community.&#13;
Space, as reflected by the size of the lot is important since&#13;
it represents a constraint on the size of the shelter structure that&#13;
can be built on it; limits the extent to which agricultural, commercial&#13;
or recreational activities can be carried out on the lot; and determines&#13;
the extent of privacy enjoyed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 209 -&#13;
Tenure has two dimensions: First, there is the security of&#13;
tenure, i.e., the protection from being forced to move involuntarily and&#13;
having to incur the transactions costs associated with such a move&#13;
(moving costs, loss of employment, etc.). The security of tenure apparently&#13;
has a considerable influence on the willingness of low-income&#13;
households to maintain and improve their dwellings.    The second&#13;
aspect of tenure relates to the ownership rights of the asset, which&#13;
convey a number of benefits in addition to security, such as the ability&#13;
to let all or part of a lot (or house), which is particularly important&#13;
for many low income property owners; the right to carry out commercial&#13;
activities on the lot; the ability to reap the capital gains of increases&#13;
in the property value; the possibility of using the property as collateral&#13;
when borrowing; and the prestige of being a property owner. Tenure&#13;
security and ownership rights -- and thus the value of property -- can&#13;
be altered extensively by public action, such as expropriation or conferral&#13;
of title, expulsion from squatter land, zoning restrictions on rental&#13;
or commercial activities, and taxation of rents or capital gains.&#13;
The availability of on-site services, such as water and energy&#13;
supply, waste disposal, drainage and security from crime and fires conveys&#13;
direct benefits associated with the consumption of these services over&#13;
and above the costs borne by the user. The benefits derived and costs&#13;
incurred on account of these services vary with the type of service&#13;
supplied (e.g., in-house water and electricity as compared with hand-carried&#13;
water or firewood), with the scale at which the services are provided,&#13;
and with the pricing policies of the (public or private) supplier.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 210 -&#13;
The availability of on-site services, especially piped water and electricity,&#13;
also makes it possible to carry out productive activities using these&#13;
services as inputs.&#13;
Finally, the shelter structure provides protection from the&#13;
elements, privacy, convenience, domestic living space and aesthetic&#13;
pleasure. It provides an opportunity for earning an income by rental&#13;
or by commercial and productive activities carried out on the premises.&#13;
Beyond the private benefits deriving from these five primary&#13;
attributes of housing there are a number of social benefits: Public&#13;
health is improved and fire hazards are reduced by more spacious, better&#13;
constructed and well-serviced housing. Housing provides an incentive&#13;
for saving and investment, as well as employment opportunities (during&#13;
construction, and by virtue of the commercial and productive activities&#13;
carried out in the house and on the lot). Finally, dilapidated housing&#13;
is an affront to the sense of aesthetics of some, and to the moral&#13;
sensitivity of others. Following aesthetic considerations, one would&#13;
be concerned primarily with the looks of things, and be mainly interested&#13;
in suppressing the symptoms of the housing problem (slum eradication,&#13;
"beautification" of cities, etc.), while following ethical precepts&#13;
one would be concerned with the consequences of poor housing for the&#13;
health, productivity and comfort of the inhabitants and search out the&#13;
most effective combination of housing attributes that is compatible&#13;
with the preferences of the dwellers and with the availability of public&#13;
and private resources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 211&#13;
Housing preferences vary, however, to considerable extent&#13;
with a number of factors, such as climate, income, household size and&#13;
composition, as well as price. A solid and well-insulated shelter structure&#13;
is obviously more important where the weather is frequently inclement,&#13;
but less important in tropical areas; and where torrential rains are&#13;
frequent, drainage is more important than in drier climates.   Somewhat&#13;
less obviously, but no less important, preferences tend to differ at&#13;
different income levels. A common pattern, which was originally&#13;
postulated by John Turner for selected Latin American cities is summarized&#13;
by Mohan (1977, p. 446):&#13;
"The poorest (e.g., fresh migrants) are mainly interested in&#13;
location. Being near job markets saves on transport costs.&#13;
In their highly uncertain situation the only security they&#13;
are interested in is job security. Their meager income only&#13;
allows for food consumption and other bare essentials in a&#13;
kind of lexicographic ordering. The only amenity they need&#13;
is space for sleeping. The next group, with a reasonably&#13;
stable income but still not well-off, is interested in&#13;
security of tenure. This group is willing to trade location&#13;
for security of tenure. A temporary job loss or other economic&#13;
misfortune does not then mean displacement of residence as well.&#13;
They are also more interested in space than amenity and are&#13;
willing to pay for it. Finally the richest income group is&#13;
more interested in amenity, having a stable income and subsis-&#13;
tence essentials. Electricity, plumbing, well-designed houses,&#13;
and recreation then become important and will be demanded&#13;
by this group."&#13;
Of course, the precise priority ranking of the attributes may&#13;
vary, since it depends also on household size and composition, and on&#13;
prices. Thus, the greater is a household the more value will it place&#13;
a space relative to other attributes. Households headed by women in&#13;
El Salvador have been found to place a greater value on shelter at the&#13;
time of moving to a new property, because they are less able to upgrade&#13;
their shelter over time (World Bank, 1977a). Furthermore, the value of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-212-&#13;
a central location depends on the labor force characteristics and econQu.iL4&#13;
activities of the adult household members.-/ Finally, rising land prices&#13;
are likely to result in a reduced demand for space and in increased&#13;
investment in structures to accommodate greater density in living, and&#13;
tend to induce location at less accessible areas of the city, as well as&#13;
the acceptance of lesser security of tenure.&#13;
Two major lessons are to be drawn from this discussion of&#13;
housing preference patterns: First, within the constraints on household&#13;
budgets, low income urban dwellers on balance will give high priority to&#13;
access, space, and some tenure security and service amenities, but will&#13;
place relatively less priority on high quality shelter and services.&#13;
This latter set of attributes, however, has tended to be emphasized in&#13;
the traditional public housing policies pursued by governments in&#13;
developing countries. Second, apart from the broad general preference&#13;
pattern just outlined, the housing preferences of the urban poor will&#13;
vary across countries,- /cities, and households. A housing policy, which&#13;
attempts to achieve greatest efficiency in the utilization of economic&#13;
resources would attempt to respect the preferences of the poor, by providing&#13;
1/ Sudra and Turner (1976) report on a number of household case studies&#13;
in Mexico City which reflect the impact of the importance of household&#13;
characteristics other than income level in determining housing preferences.&#13;
2/ For example, in the Philippines and in Zambia low income households&#13;
that have had an option to trade off lot size against level of servicing,&#13;
have opted for smaller lots with higher service levels, while the&#13;
reverse was the case in El Salvador (World Bank, 1978d).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 213 -&#13;
maximum flexibility and beneficiary participation in project and program&#13;
design to allow the beneficiaries as much choice as possible between&#13;
alternative options regarding access, lot size, tenure, servicing, and&#13;
shelter structure.&#13;
b. Housing Demand and City Growth&#13;
The demand for housing is intricately related to the growth&#13;
of cities. Most directly, the growth in population induces an increased&#13;
demand for all attributes or services which housing can offer, i.e.,&#13;
access, space, tenure, services, and shelter. Moreover, the growth&#13;
in incomes also increases people's willingness to pay for housing, further&#13;
increasing the demand for housing services. Assuming unitary population&#13;
and income elasticities of demand for housing at given prices,-/ and&#13;
taking typical population and per capita income growth rates observed&#13;
in the cities of developing countries as fluctuating around 5 percent&#13;
2/&#13;
and 3-5 percent per year respectively,    oiNe would conclude that in the&#13;
absence of price changes or supply constraints the demand for housing&#13;
services would increase at a rate of 8 to 10 percent per year.&#13;
The pressures on the stock of housing is further aggravated&#13;
by the fact that there are competing demands for the major inputs into&#13;
1/ The former assumption presupposes that there are no economies to&#13;
scale in the consumption of housing, which is reasonable; the latter&#13;
probably represents an upper limit, but is not likely to be much&#13;
mistaken (Grimes, 1976).&#13;
2/ City population growth rates are well known (see, e.g. Renaud, 1979).&#13;
Much less is known about the growth of incomes generated in cities,&#13;
but it is probably safe to say that they grow at least as rapidly as&#13;
national per capita incomes in most countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 214 -&#13;
housing, in particular for urban land. City growth is not only associated&#13;
with the growth in demand for residential land, services, and structures,&#13;
but is also accompanied by a rapid expansion of demand for land, services,&#13;
and structures for commercial and industrial purposes.-    What is more,&#13;
land may be demanded not only for its services which it provides in&#13;
residential, commercial and industrial uses, but it also is demanded as&#13;
an asset by individuals and corporations (Mohan, 1977).-1&#13;
The demand for urban land, services, and structures is thus&#13;
likely to increase even more r pidly than would be suggested by residential&#13;
demand alone, and the resulting pressures on the supply of land, services,&#13;
and construction are considerable in a context of rapid urban growth.&#13;
The ability of supply to adjust is therefore a crucial question and will&#13;
be dealt with next.&#13;
2. The Supply of Urban Housing&#13;
Increases in the supply of housing services depend largely on&#13;
increases in the stock of housing available, and thus on the investments&#13;
taking place in the housing sector. As with all stock adjustments, the&#13;
adjustments in the housing stock take time, and the more rapid is the&#13;
1/ For 21 selected LDCs, for which data are available (see Table VI-3)&#13;
residential construction on average (unweighted) accounts for&#13;
37 percent of total construction, indicating the importance of&#13;
competing demands for construction inputs from non-residential sources.&#13;
2/ The large land holdings in Bogota of the "beneficiencias," a group&#13;
of semi-official entities providing health services, are a good&#13;
example for a case where portfolio preferences have dominated land&#13;
demand decisions in an urban area, resulting in large vacant land&#13;
tracts in quite central locations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 215 -&#13;
increase in the demand for more housing stock, the more likely is it&#13;
that the supply will not keep up for all of the attributes which housing&#13;
represents. Indeed, the complexities of the demand for housing are&#13;
matched, if not surpassed by the intricacy of multiple interactions on&#13;
the supply side. The following paragraphs first show how numerous&#13;
agents interact in providing the housing supply, and then review how&#13;
various constraints impede supply adjustments in response to the rapid&#13;
increases in housing demand, or permit such adjustments only at rising&#13;
costs.&#13;
a. The Housing Supply Agents&#13;
Figure VI-1 provides a stylized picture of the urban housing&#13;
sector in LDCs, showing the common contributors to urban housing supply,&#13;
and distinguishing not only between the major activities required to&#13;
supply urban housing, but also between high, middle income, and low&#13;
income housing. To take first the case of low income housing, the&#13;
subdivision of raw land is typically performed by developers, squatters,&#13;
or absentee land owners; occasionally, it is also done by local govern-&#13;
ments or public housing agencies. The provision of on-site services&#13;
to low income housing is frequently left to owner occupants, squatters,&#13;
absentee owners, or renters, especially where water and firewood have to be&#13;
hand-carried to the house due to the absence of public services. Off-site&#13;
services may be provided by private agencies in the case of transport, health&#13;
and education, but they are mainly the domain on loca.l authorities, particularly&#13;
as regards the provision of roads and social services. Low income shelter&#13;
construction (and improvement) is generally carried out by absentee landlords&#13;

where tenements are concerned and by owner occupants or squatters, who&#13;
usually improve their housing by staged construction. Renters rarely&#13;
make significant improvements, and public authorities have only in a few&#13;
instp:ices (e.g., in Singapore and Hong Kong) contributed extensively to&#13;
the construction of low-income shelter. The responsibility for provision&#13;
of security of tenure for low-income housing rests generally with the&#13;
government, which determines the extent to which the insecure tenure&#13;
of illegal subdivisions, or of squatters on public and private land&#13;
is translated into secure free-hold tenure. Absentee owners, of course,&#13;
determine the extent to which renters can enjoy a relatively undisturbed&#13;
and secure tenancy.&#13;
The picture could be complemented by describing the major&#13;
suppliers and supply activities for middle- and high-income housing.&#13;
However, this is not central to the purpose of the present paper and&#13;
so it suffices to say that high income housing is usually provided by&#13;
developers or owner occupants in terms of subdivision, shelter construction,&#13;
and provision of tenure; on-site services are provided by the government&#13;
or the developer, off-site services mainly by the government and by&#13;
private service agencies (schools, hospitals,etc.). Middle-income&#13;
housing supply shares aspects of high- arLd low-income housing, and is&#13;
probably the most varied in terms of involvement of different supply&#13;
agents. The most important aspects are that middle-income households&#13;
are frequently to be found on illegal subdivisions, and among squatters&#13;
as well as renters,-/ and that public housing programs in the past&#13;
have tended to benefit mainly middle-income groups.&#13;
1/ See for instance Vernez (1973) for the case of Bogota.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 218 -&#13;
Overall, there are two conclusions which are important for&#13;
the remainder of this chapter: First, squatters and occupants of&#13;
illegal subdivisions make important contributions to the supply of&#13;
housing, in particular as regards the provision of on-site services&#13;
and of shelter construction. In fact, shelter construction and improve-&#13;
ment generally represents the major form of saving and investment&#13;
for the groups involved. In contrast, renters rarely contribute to&#13;
the housing supply and have much less of an option to save or invest in&#13;
the absence of suitable saving instruments or incentives. Second, urban&#13;
governments and public utility enterprises are especially heavily&#13;
involved in the provision of on- and off-site services, and the former&#13;
can play a major role in providing secure tenure of low- and middle-&#13;
income housing. Public agencies are to a much lesser extent involved in&#13;
subdivision or shelter construction, and in any case they tend to serve&#13;
mainly the middle income group.-!/ Hard figures on the breakdown between&#13;
public and private sector construction activities are very scant and&#13;
quite unreliable, and thus these conclusions are mainly based on non-&#13;
quantitative observation. Table VI-5, for instance, shows that the public&#13;
sector's share in the construction of conventional dwellings is very&#13;
high in Singapore, and quite substantial in Jamaica, Israel, Romania,&#13;
Yugoslavia and Tunisia. However, since these figures exclude non-conventional&#13;
housing, and thus understate the contribution of the private sector which&#13;
obviously prevails in the construction non-conventional housing, i.e. slums,&#13;

b. Factors Limiting Increases in the Supply of Urban Housing&#13;
The supply of new housing stock is limited by three types of&#13;
constraints: For some attributes of housing the supply is fixed or&#13;
highly inelastic in the short run, but can be expanded at approximately&#13;
constant costs in the long term; for others, the cost of supply is&#13;
rising even in the long term; and for others yet, there are transactions&#13;
costs which may impede the provision of necessary inputs. The first type&#13;
of constraint operates mainly when cities expand rapidly and when&#13;
quick adjustments can therefore be made only with rising costs. The&#13;
second type of constraint is associated mainly with the absolute size of&#13;
cities rather than their rate of growth; the last type of constraint&#13;
applies irrespective of city size or speed of growth. This distinction&#13;
is worth bearing in mind as one discuisses various specific impediments on&#13;
the adjustments in the supply of raw land, services and housing structures.&#13;
The cost of raw land may rise because the opportunity cost of&#13;
rural land may increase as the city expands;-/ in other cities, such as&#13;
Singapore, land reclamation is the only major way of adding to the urban&#13;
land area. Subdivision at the urban fringe is frequently impeded by&#13;
municipal ordinances which do not respond to increases in the demand&#13;
for urban land, or respond only with substantial lags and in the form&#13;
of discrete adjustments whose timing cannot be easily predicted&#13;
by private supply agents. Land conversion, and especially land assembly&#13;
1/ Some LDC cities, such as Bogota, are located in the midst of very&#13;
fertile agricultural land.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
221 -&#13;
may be impeded, because of lengthy expropriation procedings in the case&#13;
of public demand for land,l/ or because of zoning regulations, land&#13;
transfer taxes, or land registration requirements.2'&#13;
The cOst Of public services may increase with city size&#13;
because of natural resource constraints, particularly in the case of water&#13;
supply and waste disposal,-/ or because the city is expanding into areas&#13;
that are more and more difficult to service, on account of mountaitious&#13;
or swampy terrain.A/The cost of transport also will tend to increase&#13;
with city size, as was argued in the preceding chapter, and rising land&#13;
and labor costs will contribute to increased service costs for all urban&#13;
services.  There are furthermure considerable constraints placed on the&#13;
rate of expansion of public services because of the lumpiness of many&#13;
of the services and the lack of capital with which to finance such&#13;
lumpy system expansions. The problem is frequently compounded by high&#13;
service standards and subsidies, which undermine the financial viability&#13;
of the public service enterprise and thus limit the expansion of services,&#13;
1/ In the case of San Salvador, for example, it was found to be extremely&#13;
difficult to assemble large enough tracts of land within the urban&#13;
area for the purposes of an urban development project (World Bank, 1977a).&#13;
2/ See Dunkerley et al. (1978) for documentation; also Smith (1977).&#13;
3/ Linn and Valverde (1976) find that water and sewerage service costs in-&#13;
crease with city size across middle and large-size cities in Colombia.&#13;
Sfeir-Younis (1977) observed that most Colombian cities find it&#13;
increasingly difficult to find sites for solid waste disposal with&#13;
the urban area or in close proximity.&#13;
4/ For Cali, for instance, it was found that the average incremental&#13;
cost (AIC) of supplying water to high-lying areas is approximately&#13;
30 percent above that for the rest of the city (Linn, 1976d). For&#13;
Nairobi, the AIC for water and sewerage services in high-lying areas&#13;
was approximately 20 percent above those in low-lying areas (McLure, 1977).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 222 -&#13;
Institutional problems relating to management and planning,&#13;
imbalanced expansion of production relative to&#13;
1/&#13;
distribution facilities,- and political biases in service provision&#13;
may limit supply response. Some of these adjustment problems in the&#13;
provision of public services are less serious in the large metropolitan&#13;
areas because the local governments and public utility enterprises in&#13;
some instances have better management, planning, and pricing practices,&#13;
and generally have more ready access to capital.-/&#13;
The construction, improvement and maintenance of shelter is&#13;
often constrained in a number of respects. The supply of material inputs&#13;
into the construction sector is usually quite inelastic in the short&#13;
term, although in the longer run supplies tend to adjust to demand at&#13;
roughly constant real costs (Grimes, 1976). The short-term inelasticity&#13;
of materials supply may mean, however, that during construction booms,&#13;
such as occurred in Colombia during the early 1970s, material prices&#13;
increase rapidly, limiting especially the expansion of low-income&#13;
1/ A recent study on the urban sector in Indonesia found that underdeveloped&#13;
water distribution systems led to losses of water in some cities, while&#13;
in others water production shortages impeded the quantity and quality&#13;
of water distributed (World Bank, 1978e). In San Salvador, the imple-&#13;
mentation of the first sites and service project financed by the World&#13;
Bank was hampered by the delayed expansion in water production for&#13;
the city :,nd by the resulting difficulties in connecting the project&#13;
site to the city's water system (World Bank, 1977a).&#13;
2/ This accounts to some extent for the fact that large cities are&#13;
usually better served by public utilities than smaller cities and&#13;
towns. Demand factors have also been found to contribute, however,&#13;
in the case of Colombia (Selowsky, forthcoming) and Malaysia&#13;
(Meerman, forthcoming).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 223 -&#13;
self-constructed houslng.-/ Labor costs, particularly for skilled labor,&#13;
may also be inelastic in the short and medium term (Grimes, 1976), but&#13;
more important, especially for low income housing, tend to be the&#13;
constraints on the availability of capital to finance lumpy costs of&#13;
land and structure purchase. Mortgage markets are generally very thin,&#13;
and require high down payments and quick repayment . Clouded land titles&#13;
prevent the use of land as collateral, and artificially low interest&#13;
rates on formal capital limit the flow of funds to the hLousing market.&#13;
Those funds that are made available usually are rationed to the higher&#13;
income groups (Grimes, 1976). High standards and subsidies limit the&#13;
expansion of public housing because of budgetary constraints as has been&#13;
observed whereever such programs have been pursued.2/ Rent control&#13;
has been found to impede the supply of housing in Egypt (Wheaton, 1978;&#13;
World Bank, 1978c) and India (Waide, 1978). Taxes on housing improvements&#13;
in principle have similar effects, but the low level of property taxation&#13;
found in most LDCs makes this a relatively minor problem (Bahl and Linn,&#13;
forthcomirg).!/  Finally, one should note that whole-sale destruction&#13;
of slum or squatter areas obviously does not contribute to an increase in&#13;
the housing stock, but rather destroys considerable investments in&#13;
housing structures.&#13;
1/ In Colombia, this was observed by Peattie (1974), and Bender (1975).&#13;
2/ E.g.,in Zambia (World Bank, 1974b), Colombia (Linn, 1976b), Mexico&#13;
(Sudra and Turner, 1976), and Egypt (Wheaton, 1978), to name just&#13;
a few countries.&#13;
3/ It could, however, become a problem with heavily increased reliance&#13;
on urban property taxes, which is frequently suggested for LDC cities.&#13;
A site value tax, such as was recently introduced in Jamaica, would&#13;
avoid this problem. These questions are further discussed in the&#13;
next section.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3. The Urban Housing Problem in LDCs as the Result of Supply and&#13;
Demand Interactions&#13;
For all the reasons-cited in the preceding paragraphs the&#13;
supply of urban housing in LDCs is severely constrained. Supplies expand&#13;
over time, but unevenly for the various components or attributes&#13;
of supply and for different consumer groups, and generally only at&#13;
rising costs. One may further hazard the guess that supply adjustments&#13;
tend to be more costly the greater the city size, and the greater the&#13;
rate of urban growth. Considering that in the aggregate the supply of&#13;
housing, as reflected by the rate of increase in dwelling units due to new&#13;
construction and renovation, has generally not expanded by more than&#13;
1 to 3 percent per annum (Grimes, 1976), but that at unchanged prices demand&#13;
for housing would be expected to increase by 8 to 10 percent a year,&#13;
as was indicated above, real housing prices will tend to rise in the&#13;
rapidly growing cities of the developing countries. This leads in turn&#13;
to over-crowding, lower   quality shelter, poorer services, and worse&#13;
access than would have been the case had housing supply adjusted more&#13;
rapidly. It is for this reason that the large and rapidly growing cities&#13;
tend to experience the greatest slum and squatter problems, the poorest&#13;
quality of housing and the worst problems of over-crowding. Of course, to&#13;
the extent that supply constraints--especially those due to public action&#13;
or in-action--are less prevalent in some cities than in others, these&#13;
problems will differ between cities of similar size and similar growth rates.&#13;
To the extent that increased housing costs, over-crowding, poor&#13;
housing quality, etc. reflect the rising resource costs of providing&#13;
housing in large and rapidly growing urban areas, as well as the preference&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 225 -&#13;
patterns of urban dwellers at their prevailing incomes, these symtoms of the&#13;
urban housing problem reflect an efficient adjustment process. However,&#13;
it is apparent from the discussion of the supply constraints in the&#13;
preceding pages that housing supply adjustments are to a significant&#13;
extent influenced by public actions, and that there is reason to believe&#13;
that these actions do not necessarily result in&#13;
efficient resource allocation. Investment, pricing, and regulatory&#13;
policies in most cities have not been such as to minimize the resource&#13;
cost of urban development, by incurring higher costs than necessary in&#13;
infrastructure investments and bv rationing high cost supplies to a&#13;
few beneficiaries, where lower cost supplies could have been made more&#13;
widely available, including to the urban poor; by constraining&#13;
public service investments through inappropriate pricing policies an.&#13;
encouraging over-consumption of services through subsidized prices for&#13;
those households with access to the services; and finally, by impeding private&#13;
supply adjustments through regulations and taxes. It would therefore&#13;
be in the interest of a more efficient pattern of urban growth to pursue&#13;
policies which would remove, rather than impose constraints on the&#13;
adjustment in urban housing supply.&#13;
Distributional considerations support the conclusion of the&#13;
preceding paragraph. The increases in the costs and prices of housing&#13;
services associated with a slow supply reaction in the face of rapid demand&#13;
increases, tend to be capitalized into land and structure prices.&#13;
These capital gains are reaped by property owners. The ownership of&#13;
urban real estate is likely to be highly concentrated in many LDCs,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 226 -&#13;
although there are variations across countries and cities. One&#13;
important piece of information reflecting on the distribution of urban&#13;
real estate is the extent to wqhich urban properties are rented or&#13;
occupied by the owner. When the proportion of rental properties is&#13;
very high (as for instance in Abidjan, where 80 percent of urban&#13;
properties are estimated to be rented; World Bank, 1976b) the rapid&#13;
increases in urban property values clearly benefit the upper income&#13;
groups./ In contrast, where urban land ownership is widely distributed,&#13;
as reflected by a low proportion of rental tenure, (e.g., in Nepal,&#13;
Philippines, and Cyprus; Table VI-6), one would probably be correct&#13;
in concluding that the benefits from rising property values are more&#13;
widely distributed. Table VI-6 shows the distribution of tenure arrangements&#13;
in urban areas between owner-occupancy,rental and other forms of tenure&#13;
for 46 LDCs. The variability between countries, even within country&#13;
groupings is considerable. As Table VI-7 shows, however, there is a&#13;
concentration of countries for which owner-occupancy accounts for&#13;
40 to 50 percent of household, while there are relatively few countries&#13;
where this percentage falls short of 20 percent or exceeds 70 percent.&#13;
If non-conventional housing were added, the proportion of owner-occupancy&#13;
might be increased in some countries, if one were to count de facto&#13;

urban growth in LDCs is garnered by the high income groups, especially&#13;
since property taxation and related tax and pricing measures which would&#13;
extract some of these capital gains for the general public, are notoriously&#13;
weak and ineffective with a few exceptions, such as Colombia, Korea and&#13;
Taiwan (Bahl and Linn, forthcoming).&#13;
Another distributive impact of the slow increase in housing&#13;
supply in the face of rapid demand increases is that low income groups&#13;
suffer especially from the effects of crowding, lack of services, and&#13;
displacement fr'm favored locations close to employment opportunities&#13;
and social services. While upper and middle income groups also have to&#13;
double up, and may have to accept lesser quality services than they might&#13;
like to,l/ they are generally in a position to preempt the best housing&#13;
available, even tmder the worst of circumstances, by virtue of their&#13;
superior ability to pay. The poor are therefore bearing most directly&#13;
the costs of maladjustments in the housing supply in terms of loss of&#13;
access to employment opportunities, poor health and nutrition, as well&#13;
as inconvenience.&#13;
Equity and efficiency arguments therefore come together in&#13;
supporting policies designed to increase the supply of urban housing,&#13;
especially of housing for the poor. These policies may involve both&#13;
1/ This has important implications for the "trickle-down" hypothesis in&#13;
urban housing. Increasing the housing supply for middle and upper&#13;
income groups may not lead to increases in housing supply at the lower&#13;
end of the income scale, since the higher income groups may merely&#13;
reduce their crowding, without releasing shelter units for the poorer&#13;
income groups. Indeed, to the extent that higher and middle income&#13;
groups compete for the same inputs into their housing, increased&#13;
emphasis on higher income housing may drive costs and prices up&#13;
for low-income houses.&#13;

a removal of constraints oni housing supply, as well as public incentives&#13;
for, or direct provision of increased lhousing.  The main questions that&#13;
remain to be answered are which components of housing are appropriately&#13;
provided by the public sector, what incentives should be introduced.,&#13;
and what disincentives or constraints should be removed. The next&#13;
section turns to deal with these questions.&#13;
C. Housing for the Urban Poor: Toward a Strategy for Public Policy&#13;
The usual starting point for developing an urban housing policy&#13;
is to estimate the housing needs for a particular country or city in&#13;
terms of physical units somehow defined, to estimate the costs of meeting&#13;
these needs, and then to consider whether and how the required financial&#13;
resources can be raised, both at the household and at the government level.L/&#13;
This section accordingly begins by reviewing alternative approaches to&#13;
housing needs estimates. For these estimates to be useful, allowance&#13;
must be made for the ability and willingness of the poor to pay for housing.&#13;
Furthermore, the estimation of housing needs must be complemented&#13;
by an analysis of how housing supply is actually to be brought up to meet&#13;
the postulated needs. This, in fact, is the crucial area of housing&#13;
policy, and is dealt with in some detail in the remainder of this chapter.&#13;
1. Estimating Housing Needs&#13;
The conventional analysis of housing needs starts with a definition&#13;
of housing attributes focusing mainly on space, services, and structural&#13;
qualities of the housing unit which are regarded as adequate. Usually&#13;
these involve standards comparable to those commonly found in middle,&#13;
1/ For recent examples see Jamaica Ministry of Finance and Planning (1977)&#13;
for Jamaica; and World Bank (1978e) for Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

or even upper income housing, and thus reflect implicitly not only the&#13;
income levels of middle-income households, but also their preferences&#13;
as regards the priority ranking of the various attributes of&#13;
housing. What is more, important attributes such as location or access,&#13;
and tenure are generally not considered at all in the estimates of&#13;
housing needs, although these may be among the most important housing&#13;
attributes for the low income groups. The conventional procedure for&#13;
estimating housing needs therefore starts with a set of parameters&#13;
which reflect neither the ability, nor the willingness to pay of significant&#13;
portions of the urban population. l/&#13;
Given this starting point it is not surprising to find that&#13;
conventional housing policies have involved the construction of houses&#13;
which are not affordable by the poor. For instance, in Manila in 1975&#13;
even with a subsidy ranging from 16 to 44 percent, the cheapest official&#13;
housing units were not affordable by households in the lower half of&#13;
the income distribution (World Bank, 1975c). In Cairo, official housing&#13;
is affordable only to the highest 10 percent (World Bank, 1978c).&#13;
50 percent of the population in Rabat (Morocco), and 80 percent of the&#13;
squatters in that city cannot afford conventional public housing&#13;
(World Bank, 1978f). In Indonesia conventional sites and service programs&#13;
1/ Tne following statement reflects well the common practice: "In Jamaica&#13;
it is felt that 30 square meters (323 sq. ft.) is inadequate for a&#13;
household and that 420 sq. ft. should be the minimum floor area bearing&#13;
in mind the average family size. The standard of 420 sq. ft. is that&#13;
used by the Ministry of Housing." (Jamaica Ministry of Finance and&#13;
Planning, 1977, p. 3.23). The report goes on to show that at this&#13;
standard 61 percent of households cannot afford public housing in&#13;
Jamaica (ibid., p. 3.27).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 233&#13;
and "low income housing" are beyond the ability-to-pay of the lower 30&#13;
to 40 percent of the urban population to be served, despite a subsidy&#13;
estimated to amount to 65 percent of total cost (World Bank, 1978e).1/&#13;
Since the poor cannot afford publicly constructed housing of this type,&#13;
the housing units almost invariably have been purchased or leased by&#13;
high-income groups.&#13;
Nor is it surprising to find that public housing programs in&#13;
the past often have not respected the preferences of the poor beneficiaries,&#13;
especially as regards location and tenure security. The problems&#13;
encountered in Rio de Janeiro with public housing programs have been&#13;
well documented by Perlman (1976b) and Rush (1974), in particular the&#13;
fact that the public housing developments were located far from employ-&#13;
ment apportunities and gave the tenants little security of tenure.&#13;
Similar difficulties were encountered in Manila (World Bank, 1975c)&#13;
and elsewhere (Grimes, 1976).&#13;
Finally, it comes as no surprise that the number of housing units&#13;
actually built iii these types of public programs always fall short of the&#13;
postulated housing needs and that studies of the total budgetary resources&#13;
required to meet the housing needs have to conclude that urban&#13;
housing in LDCs represents a "bottomless pit."&#13;
This type of housing needs analysis is certainly not very useful&#13;
and the conclusion of despair and hopelessness can in fact undermine any&#13;
1/ Similar examples could be cited for other countries and cities, e.g.&#13;
for Mexico (World Bank, 1978g), El Salvador (Fernandez-Palacios, 1978),&#13;
Ivory Coast (World Bank, 1976b), and for the cities serveyed by&#13;
Grimes (1976), especially Nairobi, Bogota, Ahmedabad and Madras.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

reasonable effort of dealing with the housing problem in developing countries.&#13;
This does not mean, however, that all housing needs analyses are necessarily&#13;
useless, as is demonstrated by a recent exercise carried out by Churchill&#13;
and Lycette (1978). Instead of starting off with some physical standard&#13;
of adequate housing, they take it as a "basic need" that all households&#13;
currently below the poverty line should be brought up at least to the&#13;
poverty line in terms of their aggregate consumption, including the&#13;
consumption of housing. Churchill and Lycette then estimate the invest-&#13;
ment required to provide housing to all the poor at the standard which&#13;
those currently at the poverty threshold can afford.-   Since poverty&#13;
thresholds vary from country to country in terms of the income level&#13;
at which they are set, the postulated household expenditure on housing&#13;
also varies, as does the physical standard of housing implied by the&#13;
expenditure figures. These standards are still arbitrary in the sense&#13;
that they reflect value judgements inherent in the definition of poverty&#13;
thresholds, which are of course a crucial input to this exercise.&#13;
However, the standards are derived so as to ensure that they do not&#13;
reflect implicitly the income levels of middle- or high-income groups,&#13;
but so that they define a minimum housing expenditure compatible&#13;
with incomes at the poverty threshold, up to which one presumably wants&#13;
to bring all households over a reasonable time period.-1 Furthermore,&#13;
1/ An affordable housing expenditure was defined to represent 20 percent&#13;
of household income, on the basis of empirical observations&#13;
indicating this to be the typical propensity to spend on housing&#13;
by the poor in LDCs.&#13;
2/ Churchill and Lycette (1978) take the year 2000 as their target date.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 235 -&#13;
typical preference patterns at the poverty level are respected in this&#13;
estimate of housing needs, by using the average propensity to spend on&#13;
housing by the poor as an estimation criterion. As a result, housing&#13;
programs that are compatible with these estimates wol1d not require&#13;
undue distortions in the expenditure baskets of the poor, providing that&#13;
complementary policies (e.g., in the area of nutrition, health, education,&#13;
etc.) ensure that those below the poverty threshold are brought up to&#13;
the threshold not only in terms of their consumption of housing, but&#13;
also of food, clothing, etc.&#13;
The budgetary implications of such a "basic needs" housing&#13;
strategy can then be estimated, and they are shown in Table VI-7.1/&#13;
In terms of absolute investment needs, India, Indonesia, Brazil and&#13;
Mexico loom very large, and jointly account for 71 percent of the&#13;
investment requirements. The six countries of low-income Asia together&#13;
account for 47 percent of investment needs. Required annual investment&#13;
needs expressed as a fraction of government revenue and of GNP are also&#13;
the highest in this country group. These investments are probably not&#13;
within the range of fiscal feasibility, and may in part reflect the&#13;
fact that the propensity to spend on housing is in general substantially&#13;
below the 20 percent rate assumed by Churchill and Lycette (1978) as&#13;
shown in Table VI-1 and VI-2 above. It does, however, also reflect&#13;
the very large number of households living in poverty in these countries&#13;
and the low level of GNP and fiscal resources available to provide even&#13;
a minimum degree of poverty alleviation. A feasible housing strategy&#13;
1/ Churchill and Lycette (1978) emphasize that their estimates are merely&#13;
indicative of the general order of magnitude of required investments,&#13;
since they are based on a number of broad assumptions.&#13;

for these countries would therefore have to employ standards even lower&#13;
than those implied by poverty threshold housing expenditure.&#13;
With some notable exceptions (especially, Tanzania and Mexico)&#13;
the picture looks considerably brighter for most other countries, in&#13;
the sense that relatively much smaller shares of government revenue&#13;
"basc neds"sheter1/&#13;
and GNP would have to be devoted to a "basic needs" shelter strategy.-&#13;
However, even for the middle-income countries one should not&#13;
indulge in overly optimistic reactions. Considering the troubles which&#13;
most industrialized countries are having in raising the share of official&#13;
development assistance from typically 0.3 percent of GNP to the target level&#13;
of 0.7 percent, one should not necessarily expect the LDCs to have a much&#13;
easier time in shifting the budgets so as to devote an additional 0.5 or 1.0&#13;
percent of GNP to housing for the poor. The exercise is nevertheless useful&#13;
in indicating which countries have to be particularly concerned about their&#13;
housing policies in terms of bringing supply costs down so as to provide&#13;
housing solutions which are within reach of everyone, including those&#13;
below the poverty threshold, and for which the fiscal implications of&#13;
providing the basic shelter needs to those below the poverty threshold&#13;
are within the range of feasibility.&#13;
In any case, estimates of housing needs have to be translated not&#13;
only into global, national, or city-specific investment figures, but must&#13;
also be linked with a detailed housing supply strategy that makes allowance&#13;
not only for the ability to pay of low-income households, but also gives&#13;

housing policy in the middle-income countries (Selowsky, 1979).&#13;

explicit consideration to their preferences as regards the various&#13;
attributes of housing, such as location, space, tenure, services, and&#13;
structure. The remainder of this section discusses a number of policy&#13;
options which can be pursued in an attempt to meet the housing needs&#13;
of the poor in line with their preferences.&#13;
2. Policies Designed to Increase the Supply of Housing for the Poor&#13;
and Lower its Costs&#13;
Since public resources available for low-income housing are&#13;
severely limited, the major question to be asked by the policy maker&#13;
is how the public sector can best increase supplies&#13;
or lower costs of housing to the poor through direct&#13;
intervention. Public sector involvement prima facie deserves consideration&#13;
where there exist substantial economies to scale, externalities, or&#13;
market imperfections, such as monopoly or monopsony, lack of information,&#13;
and the like. Without any doubt, the public sector is best equipped&#13;
to counteract inefficiencies in the housing market which&#13;
are generated by its own policies!   In the absence of significant&#13;
economies to scale, externalities, or market imperfections public inter-&#13;
vention is not likely to be appropriate, unless it can be shown to have&#13;
a direct impact in improving the welfare of those below the poverty&#13;
threshold. And even then there is good reason to emphasize those areas&#13;
of public housing intervention, where individual households are least&#13;
able to find solutions for themselves.&#13;
On the basis of this general principle three broad types of&#13;
policy instruments will now be discussed: direct supply of housing&#13;
services by the government, tax and pricing policies, and regulations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 240 -&#13;
a. Direct Supply of Housing Services&#13;
Public supply of housing services may involve all five major&#13;
attributes of housing which were discussed earlier: location (or access),&#13;
space, tenure, on-site services, and the shelter structure. The provisior&#13;
or location, space and tenure rights is best treated jointly, since it&#13;
involves the three major attributes of raw land, and most public actions&#13;
in this area must somehow deal with the prevailing conditions in the&#13;
urban land market.&#13;
(i) Public Intervention in the Urban Land Market:l/&#13;
A very important determinant of the public sector's ability&#13;
to intervene directly in the urban land market is the extent to which&#13;
land is publicly or privately owned. Where there exist large tracts of public&#13;
land within the urban area or at its fringe, the government may directly&#13;
intervene. Vacant land can be subdivided and made available for housing&#13;
programs. Where public land is occupied by squatters, the government can&#13;
combine slum upgrading programs with efforts to regularize tenure. The&#13;
former approach, which in many respects is by far the easiest -- it does&#13;
not involve fiscal resources or complicated acquisition procedures --&#13;
is not of broad relevance for most cities in developing countries, since,&#13;
although government ownership of urban land is not uncommon, its avail-&#13;
ability in the form of vacant land is generally quite limited, and is&#13;
even more limited as regards vacant land in locations close to employment&#13;
apportunities. There exist, of course, special circumstances which&#13;
permit the use of vacant public land with good accessibility, as for&#13;
1/ Many of the issues raised here are treated at much greater length&#13;
in Dunkerley et al. (1978)..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 241 -&#13;
example a centrally located military airfield in Cali (Colombia),&#13;
whose conversion to residential use has been discussed as an option&#13;
to provide improved housing in that city. However, while the search&#13;
for such un- or under-utilized public urban land is worthwhile, it is&#13;
not likely to provide an answer to the long term housing problem in&#13;
most cities, including Cali.l/&#13;
The regularization of tenure rights on land owned by the public&#13;
sector, but occupied by squatters is a more common possibility of&#13;
improving the housing conditions of the squatters, directly by increasing&#13;
tenure security and providing ownership rights; and indirectly, by&#13;
assisting private efforts of shelter upgrading, since tenure security and&#13;
ownership rights are known to act as incentives for shelter improvement&#13;
and permit better access to capital markets, as the new owner-occupants&#13;
are able to offer their land as collateral. World Bank urban development&#13;
projects involve numerous examples of this type of approach, for instance&#13;
in Cairo (World Bank, 1978c), Manila (World Bank, 1976e), Rabat (World Bank,&#13;
1978f), and Lazaro Cardenas in Mexico (World Bank, 1978g), to mention&#13;
just a few. A problem with this approach is that it may be seen as&#13;
encouraging more squatting on public land, since it would appear to&#13;
involve ex post sanctioning of land invasions. One way to reduce the&#13;
political objections to this procedure and to provide at least some&#13;
disincentives to squatters, is to require some payment in exchange for&#13;
the conferral of title. This in turn is likely to be easier to extract,&#13;
if the regularization of land titles is combined with other elements of&#13;
I/  Fven where public land in good locations appears to be available for conversion&#13;
in principle, problems are us'xally encountered in practice, because of the need&#13;
to negotiate land transfers between different public agencies, who may have&#13;
different perceptions of the relative priorities of urban land use. This is&#13;
a case where serious delays may be caused by fragmented public authority.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 242 -&#13;
an upgrading policy, especially the provision of public services, siicZe&#13;
the beneficiaries in this case obtain an immediate improvement in their&#13;
overall living standard, and their willingness to pay is likely to be&#13;
considerably increased. The case of the World Bank's urban development&#13;
project in Cairo is particularly interesting in this respect. The&#13;
payments for land title regularization in squatter areas involving public&#13;
lands is expected to bring a sizeable surplus to the executing agency&#13;
within a relatively short period, that in turn may be used to finance&#13;
squatter upgrading programs elsewhere (World Bank, 1978c).&#13;
More serious difficulties of public land provision occur where&#13;
land is privately owned, and the government has to acquire land, whether&#13;
vacant, illegally subdivided, or occupied by squatters. In the case of&#13;
privately owned vacant land, its acquisition and assembly in close&#13;
proximity to employment opportunities is complicated by the difficulty&#13;
of finding such land available, in overcoming the private owners'&#13;
objections to public acquisition or expropriation, and in meeting the&#13;
financial costs which the acquisition of such land frequently implies, unless&#13;
compensation to land owners is significantly below market prices, which&#13;
in turn will increase the owners' opposition and tend to delay, if not&#13;
abort, public action.'1&#13;
Public land assembly and subdivision tends to be easier at the&#13;
urban periphery, mainly because larger tracts of vacant land are usually&#13;
available, involving fewer private owners and thus a reduced need for&#13;
negotiation. Two problems, however, arise. First, peripheral land may&#13;
not provide accessibility to employment opportunities, unless transport&#13;
1/ The difficulties encountered in San Salvador in attempting to assemble&#13;
sufficient land for the sites and service projects financed by the&#13;
World Bank are an example of the problems incurred in land&#13;
assembly in large urban areas (World Bank, 1977a).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 243 -&#13;
system improvements are also made, or unless concomitant decisions&#13;
regarding employment and off-site service location complement the public&#13;
land acquisition. Second, there is the question of when to acquire&#13;
peripheral land. Early acquisition has the benefit of resulting in&#13;
lower land costs, but requires careful planning and the management of&#13;
public land before it is actually developed. It also ties up public budgetary&#13;
resources. On the other hand, acquisition at the time of subdivision&#13;
and development results in higher land costs, unless the public sector&#13;
is willing and able to expropriate the land below market prices. While&#13;
there is no simple solution to this dilemma, it is clear that public&#13;
"land banking," as it has sometimes been called, must be evaluated&#13;
very carefully and is no easy remedy to the housing problem in LDC&#13;
cities (Dunkerley et al, 1978).&#13;
In the case where private land is occupied by squatters the&#13;
problems incurred are akin to those of squatter areas involving public&#13;
land, except that in this case the regularization of land tenure would&#13;
have to involve also negotiations with and compensation payments to the&#13;
private owners, unless the land is expropriated without compensation.&#13;
The Rabat Urban Development Project financed by the World Bank is a case&#13;
which involves land tenure regularization for squatters on private land.&#13;
As was pointed out in the appraisal report, public land acquisition can&#13;
take a long time, but in Morocco legal instruments exist which permit&#13;
"provisional public acquisition," a procedure akin to expropriation&#13;
which gives the government considerable strength in bargaining over&#13;
acquisition prices and timing (World Bank, 1978f). The existence of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
244 -&#13;
a legal framework permitting such public action is evidently important,&#13;
but is frcq-&gt;ntly absent.&#13;
The case of illegal subdivision of privately ow-ned land&#13;
occurs quite frequently in the cities of developing countries (e.g., in&#13;
Bogota and San Salvador), and consists in the subdivision and sale of&#13;
privately owned land where this is not permitted by the zoning ordinances&#13;
of a city. The implication for the de facto owners is that they do not&#13;
have secure tenure of legal ownership of the land and suffer the resulting&#13;
complications discussed earlier. The problem for local authorities is&#13;
that frequently they cannot collect property taxes in these areas, since&#13;
the de jure owners have no incentive to pay, and the de facto owners&#13;
are not even registered in the city's cadastre. Public intervention is&#13;
in principle relat -ely easy and involves transferring to the de facto&#13;
land owners the full tenure rights. In practice, the matter is again&#13;
not quite so straight forward, since there is again the common fear that&#13;
the ex post sanctioning of illegal subdivisions will encourage more of&#13;
the same kind in the future. Again, by extracting a payment for tenure&#13;
regularization this problem may at least in part be circumvented. Another&#13;
measure would be to abandon restrictive zoning regulations on the grounds&#13;
that these are not effective anyway, and only hinder the efficient operations&#13;
of the urban land market. This issue is discussed below.&#13;
Three further considerations must be added to this discussion:&#13;
First, throughout this paper the importance of location and access for&#13;
the low-income groups has been discussed. Public land acquisition and&#13;
subdivision is obviously not the only way in which land tracts with&#13;
desirable locational characteristics can be made available to poor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 245 -&#13;
households. Complementary actions in the areas of transport improvements,&#13;
and of decerSralization of employment and off-site service location is&#13;
probably as Lmportant a set of policies in the long term as is direct&#13;
government intervention in the land market. To provide a maximum of&#13;
benefits from all these instruments their deployment should be planned&#13;
jointly, which is, however easier said than done, given the commonly&#13;
found fragnpentation of planning and implementation authority in these areas.&#13;
Second, in actually carrying out public subdivisions, considerable&#13;
cost savings per plot may be incurred by reducing the average plot size,&#13;
particularly in locations where land costs are high. World Bank projects&#13;
in Mexico, Botswana and Upper Volta-/ have shown that reduced lot size&#13;
below that found in conventional public housing programs can reduce&#13;
project costs considerably and thus permit a program that reaches further&#13;
down in the income distribution scale, while still meeting the preferences&#13;
of the poor beneficiaries. The previously cited examples of Zambia and&#13;
the Philippines,where beneficiaries were willing to trade smaller lot&#13;
size for better service levels, and the contrasting experience in&#13;
El Salvador, where the reverse pattern was observed, indicate also that&#13;
preferences of project beneficiaries are important in this context and their&#13;
consideration can contribute significantly to the success (or failure) of a project.&#13;
Finally, complementary action to strengthen the cadastral&#13;
services in urban areas is often a crucial component of public land&#13;
policy, since the absence of valid land registration, property surveys&#13;
and land valuation records impedes the functioning of the land market&#13;
1/ World Bank (1978c, 1978h, 1978i).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 246 -&#13;
(i.e., interferes with real estate transactions), reduces the usefulness&#13;
of land as collateral in borrowing, creates uncertainty of tenure rights&#13;
and impedes property taxation (Dunkerley et al. 1978). Improvements in&#13;
the urbani real estate registers, however, are often useful only when&#13;
combined with efforts to regularize tenure rights. Concerted action&#13;
is therefore crucial.    Again, fragmentation of responsibility&#13;
between various public agencies may hamper a coordinated approach in&#13;
this as in other areas of urban policy action.&#13;
This discussion of direct public intervention in the urban land&#13;
markcet can be concluded by a brief evaluation of the various possible&#13;
avenues of action in terms of the criteria set forth&#13;
earlier. Public, rather than private initiative&#13;
is clearly required in the following areas: subdivision of publicly&#13;
owned land and regularization of land titles of illegal and squatter&#13;
subdivisions on private and public land; improved cadastral services;&#13;
and decentralized location of public off-site services and employment&#13;
opportunities. In contrast, the public sector has much less of a clear&#13;
advantage in the acquisition and subdivision of privately held land or&#13;
in land banking. The first set of public actions can considerably lower&#13;
the cost of urban land supply and increase the efficiency of the urban&#13;
housing market, and can serve as a vehicle for asset transfers from&#13;
high to low income groups and from the public sector to poor households&#13;
in a way that will meet with relatively little political opposition. /&#13;
As regards the second set of policy actions, it is not clear that this&#13;
1/ These actions involve not only benefits, but also costs; a cost-&#13;
benefit evaluation, even if only quite rough, should therefore&#13;
precede the implementation of these actions. In any case, only&#13;
public action is feasible in these areas, since private substitutes&#13;
are not available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 247 -&#13;
type of public intervention in the land market is more efficient than&#13;
private intervention. In terms of the goal of redistribution of urban&#13;
land ownership and rental incomes, public land acquisition and development&#13;
may be an effective tool, if the political will and the legal machinery&#13;
exists to impose a far-reaching expropriation of urban real estate at&#13;
levels of compensation substantially below market prices. This is not&#13;
likely to be politically feasible in many countries and instead various&#13;
tax and pricing measures must be relied upon to achieve a more even&#13;
distribution of the gains associated with urban land ow/ership.-/&#13;
(ii) Provision of Public Services:&#13;
Without any doubt the provision of public services such as&#13;
water supply, energy, waste disposal, drainage and circulation are areas&#13;
in which the public sector has a major role to play A/ Economies of scale,&#13;
externalities, and the possibility of monopoly conditions under private&#13;
sector provision are well-known arguments for the public provision of urban&#13;
utility services. Economies of scale and avoidance of monopoly rents&#13;
are most easily demonstrated for the case of water supply and energy,&#13;
where comparative information on the cost savings derived from public&#13;
1/ 'Jrban land was nationalized a few years ago in Tanzania. The&#13;
experience to date appears to indicate that the efficiency of urban&#13;
land market operations has been reduced, while the distribution of&#13;
benefits from urbanization has probably improved as a result, without,&#13;
however, necessarily benefiting the poorest urban households. Unfor-&#13;
tunately, no systematic evaluation of the Tazanian case appears to&#13;
be available.&#13;
2/ Other services such as telephone services, police and fire protection,&#13;
and recreation are also areas where public intervention is warranted.&#13;
These will not be discussed in detail, because telephone services&#13;
are not of primary importance in the context of provision of housing&#13;
for the poor, and little is known on the supply conditions of the&#13;
other services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 248 -&#13;
provision of these services are available. The concern here is not with&#13;
the question of economies of scale associated with larger as against&#13;
smaller size of water supply systems./ Rather, the emphasis is on a&#13;
cost comparison between water supplies available directly from public&#13;
supplies (either piped in-house, or from an easily accessible water tap),&#13;
and water supplied by carriers or other vendors, Table VI-8 shows that&#13;
the cost differences are tremendous in most countries or cities for&#13;
which information is available. While the base price charged by the&#13;
utilities in many cases includes considerable subsidies, the&#13;
difference between the utility's tariff and the vendor's price reflects&#13;
a combination of increased resource cost and monopoly rent.-/ The&#13;
impact on poor households without direct access to public water supply&#13;
is obvious: They pay a very much higher price for a commodity which is&#13;
of lesser quality 3/than do consumers who are connected to the service.&#13;
The impact can be dramatic in terms of household expanditures: In Lima,&#13;
households purchasing water from vendors spend typically between 2.6&#13;
and 2.7 percent of their incomes on water, while those with direct access&#13;
to piped water spend only between 0.4 and 0.7 percent of their incomes&#13;
(Thomas, 1978). In Indonesia, the poorest households have been observed&#13;
to spend as much as 7 percent of their income on water (World Bank, 1978c).&#13;
1/ See Saunders and Warford (1976) for information relating to this&#13;
question.&#13;
2/ The latter can be substantial as a recent study for Indonesia has&#13;
shown (World Bank, 1978e).&#13;
3/ The Indonesia report also indicates that consumers often are sold&#13;
well water (of presumably lower quality than piped water) when they&#13;
believe to be receiving water from the municipal pipes (World Bank,&#13;
1978e).&#13;

For energy, the situation is not much different: Thomas (1978) estimates&#13;
that alternative sources of light are over twice as expensive as&#13;
electricity, and Findley (1977, p. 45) reports on a study showing that&#13;
in Manila "squatters pay more for light using Kerosene lamps than&#13;
these who have electricity." Although quantitative evidence is not&#13;
readily available, there can be little doubt that economies of scale&#13;
are also important in the case of the remaining services discussed here.&#13;
They are probably least important in the case of waste disposal where&#13;
it has been shown that small-scale conventional technologies, such as&#13;
pit latrines or septic tanks in the case of sewage, and house-to-house&#13;
collection of recyclable solid waste are frequently cost-effective private&#13;
alternatives to publicly provided sewerage systems and garbage collection&#13;
and disposal (Kalbermatten et al., 1978; Sfeir-Younis, 1977).&#13;
Externalities can also be an important argument for the public&#13;
provision of on-site services. Most notable are the health impacts&#13;
of sanitation, 1 and while public supply of water and sewerage services&#13;
is not necessarily the only way to allow for these externalities&#13;
(appropriate pricing or regulation might be an alternative), it&#13;
is one way to bring about a wide acceptance of systems&#13;
connections and service levels which provide the social benefits derived&#13;
from these services. Services such as circulation and drainage can be&#13;
1/ See Saunders and Warford (1976) for a survey of the evidence of the&#13;
health impacts of water supply and sewerage disposal facilities.&#13;
Available studies appear to indicate that there are indeed substantial&#13;
health benefits that can be reaped from water and sewerage services,&#13;
but that the relationship is complicated by a number of other factors&#13;
affecting public health in LDCs, in particular the prevailing hygienic&#13;
practices (see also World. Bank, 1975a; and Kalbermatten et al., 1978).&#13;

and are frequently installed by developers of higher income urban housing&#13;
units even in LDC cities,- but their maintenance -- and in low-income&#13;
neighborhoods even their initial provision --, must obviously rest with&#13;
public agencies, due to the public goods nature of these services. To&#13;
the extent that the externalities derived from on-site and related&#13;
services are internal to a particular neighborhood -- this is certainly&#13;
the case for circulation facilities, and to a considerable extent for&#13;
the external benefits derived from the remaining services --, one can&#13;
conceive of the public provision of these services again as implying&#13;
cost reductions to the community, and in this way inc-,eaaing the&#13;
efficiency of resource allocation for the community as a whole and&#13;
yielding a fiscal dividend.&#13;
There is thus little doubt that the public provision of site-related&#13;
public services can provide important cost reductions to the household&#13;
as well as increased benefits. Another question is what should be the&#13;
standards at which the public services are provided. A survey of&#13;
World Bank sites and services projects carried out in 1974 showed that,&#13;
on average and per plot,reductions in the capital costs of service&#13;
facilities could be achieved by adoptitng lower standards: For water&#13;
supply, the average cost of communal stand pipes fell in the range of&#13;
$30-50 as compared with $80 for individual plot connections; -/ for&#13;

by law to install water supply and sewerage reticulation systems as well&#13;
as dratnage and circulation facilities. In practice, these regulations&#13;
can be enforced only in high income developments, however.&#13;
2/ Warford and Julius.(1977, p.338) also report on a recent World Bank&#13;
study for a densely populated city in the Yemen Arab Republic where&#13;
it was found that "moving from a 100-meter to a 50-meter standpipe&#13;
spacing more than doubled per capita distribution costs, while&#13;
moving from 50-meter radii standpipes to patio-connections more&#13;
than quadrupled per capita costs."&#13;

sewerage, the average per plot cost of a pit latrine was US$20 while&#13;
it amounte&amp;7 to US$180 for a connection to a 'To-.-rborne sewerage system.&#13;
For neighborhood roads and drainage, three alternative quality standards&#13;
were compared, yielding average costs of US$150, 100, and 25 respectively&#13;
for high, medium and low standards (World Bank, 1974c). These estimates&#13;
can only give a general impression of possible cost savings, since&#13;
subsequent studies of the costs of alternative service standards have&#13;
shown that a rigorous comparison of &amp;osts is not always easily carried&#13;
out. Furthermore, one must of course be concerned with any differences&#13;
in benefits, in order to arrive at an overall evaluation of net benefits&#13;
accruing from alternative standards.&#13;
For the case of water supply, Saunders and Warford (1976, p. 125)&#13;
conclude that "in view of the many possible systems configurations and&#13;
variations in popivlation density and service sosts, it is almost impossible&#13;
to generalize about the relative cost of household versus standpost&#13;
supplies."l/ While this is probably true as a genc:JI statement, one&#13;
1/ Warford and Saunders also emphasize some of the practical difficulties&#13;
encountered in p.reventing misuse -and waste-ii-t-he-ease-o-f---txard-post.*&#13;
The following example presents a colorful demonstration of their point:&#13;
"Another wastage-limiting device for public standposts that makes"&#13;
use of a reservoir and float mechanism operates essentially as a&#13;
siphoning tank fbr water (used in iabon and Cam'eroon).  In this case,&#13;
on the outside of a tank there is a nipple connected to a fixed tube   -&#13;
extending inside the tank down into the water. Each water consumer&#13;
brings his own plastic tube which is inserted over the outside nipple.&#13;
'-The cioinsumer then suks" on the tube until water begins to flow.  The&#13;
disadvantage with this means of dispensing water is that little&#13;
children, who enjoy making gurgling noises, have a considerable&#13;
propensity to blow into the nipples, thus contaminating the water.&#13;
Also, the tubes used by inidvidual consumers tend to become contaminated&#13;
rapidly."  (Saunders and Warford, 1976, p. 183).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 253 -&#13;
may nevertheless conclude from the cost data cited previously that in&#13;
cities where average incomes are extremely low, such as in most countries&#13;
of Sub-Saharan Africa and in Low Income Asia, community water supplies&#13;
must almost inevitably be chosen if the costs are to be affordable to&#13;
the households involved, and if public service is to be provided to a&#13;
substantial portion of low-income households, given the government's&#13;
budgetary constraints. In the middle-income countries individual&#13;
house connections are generally affordable by low-income households and&#13;
to the extent that subsidization is necessary this poses no undue&#13;
financial burden on the utility companies since cross-subsidization is&#13;
feasible between users. This conclusion is confirmed by the selection&#13;
of water service standards for a large number of urban development projects&#13;
that have recently been financed by the World Bank.-/&#13;
For the disposal of sanitary wastes, a study of&#13;
alternative technologies carried out in the World Bank permits the&#13;
conclusion that&#13;
"there are many proven technologies available which provide&#13;
satisfactory service levels and the potential for full health&#13;
benefits. Waterborne sewerage is not likely to be the most&#13;
cost effective solution to human waste disposal for most&#13;
situations in developing countries. Given the present stage&#13;
of the art, it is the only feasible solution in the high&#13;
density, westernized areas of cities. But less expensive,&#13;
equally effective technologies exist for application in other&#13;
urban and the rural areas." (Kalbermatten et al., p. XV;&#13;
italics added.)&#13;
1/ It is also confirmed by the recent statements of regional economists&#13;
in the World Bank, regarding urban poverty policies in the six&#13;
regional country groups (for a summary, see Appendix A).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Table VI-9 provides a summary overview of the cost savings feasible by&#13;
using low as against high cost technologies. The ratio of the cost of&#13;
conventional septic tanks and waterborne sewerage systems compared&#13;
to low cost alternatives, in particular vacuum truck cartage and low&#13;
cost septic tanks,is of the order of 10 to 1. The affordability to&#13;
low income households varies accordingly: For the low cost alternatives&#13;
about 5 percent of a typical poor household's income would be required&#13;
to finance the system at 8 percent interest over five years, while for&#13;
high cost systems the proportion is about 50 percent at a rate of interest&#13;
of 8 percent and financing over 20 years.l/&#13;
In evaluating the desirability of alternative sanitation systems&#13;
three further points should be borne in mind: First, high cost systems&#13;
require that large amounts of water be used with human waste disposal.&#13;
Water production itself involves considerable costs, and much of these&#13;
can be saved with the application of low cost systems. Second, at low&#13;
suburban densities, the health benefits of alternative systems suitable&#13;
for urban use are virtually identical. At higher densities the sewered&#13;
1/ A very rough calculation of global cost savings resulting from the&#13;
adoption of low-cost sanitation technology may be made: WHO has&#13;
estimated that it would cost US$14.4 billion to raise the proportion&#13;
of urban households that have some form of sanitary excreta disposal&#13;
from 72% to 94% betweevy 1975 and 1980, assuming that approximately&#13;
half of the new serv.,. !,ould be provided by conventional public&#13;
sewers and the remainuer by household systems (WHO, 1976). If in&#13;
fact only      low-cost household systems were provided, and if one&#13;
assumes that the cost ratio of public sewer versus household systems&#13;
is 10 -t 1, then only US$2.6 billion would need to be invested,&#13;
representing a cost saving of US$11.8 billion. Obviously this is&#13;
an extreme scenario, but provides some idea of the potential impact&#13;
of low-cost technology for sanitation.&#13;

aqua privy allows maintenance of health benefits under almost all&#13;
circumstances, except the high-density, central-city areas. Third,&#13;
all of these alternatives have been used and shown to be functional,&#13;
although different low-cost systems may have to be used in different&#13;
countries to allow for differences in climatic and soil conditions or in&#13;
cultural preferences.l/&#13;
For other services much less information on possible cost&#13;
savings is available, although again there is evidence that low cost&#13;
alternatives are available, but are frequently not used in LDC cities.&#13;
For neighborhood roads and drainage the figures cited above from early&#13;
World Bank projects are indicative of possible cost savings and have&#13;
been supported recently in an urban transport project in Brazil&#13;
(World Bank, 1978b). In the case of solid waste collection and disposal&#13;
the main technological choices relate to the extent of motorization&#13;
in collection, and the technique of disposal.-/ As regards collection,&#13;
the use of high cost options such as compactor trucks should probably&#13;
be minimized in favor of flat-bed trucks and hand carts. As regards&#13;
disposal, sanitary land fills are virtually always preferable to expensive&#13;
and capital intensive composting facilities or incinerators. This is&#13;
1/ In Botswana, for example, aqua privies were found not to be socially&#13;
acceptable, pit latrines could not be used because of poor soakage,&#13;
and waterborne sewerage systems were too expensive. An alternative&#13;
low-cost, dry-sanitation system therefore had to be installed&#13;
(World Bank, 1978h).&#13;

technologies for solid waste disposal in Colombia.&#13;

particularly the case where a signigicant ntmber of low income people&#13;
are involved in solid waste collection and disposal activities, as is&#13;
the case with the "picadores" (pickers) in Medellin (Colombia) and&#13;
the "Zabbaleen" (waste collectors) in Cairo (Sfeir-Younis, 1977; and&#13;
World Bank, 1978c).&#13;
In summary, one can conclude that public provision of urban&#13;
services can provide extensive cost reductions as compared with private&#13;
substitutes commonly used by poor private households, and that an&#13;
appropriate selection of public service technologies can further reduce&#13;
costs to the consumer and the public agency to the point where public&#13;
services are affordable even by poor households, and where universal&#13;
service provision becomes financially feasible in most cities in LDCs.&#13;
At the same time, no or only relatively minor losses in benefits are&#13;
associated with a switch from high to low cost technologies in this&#13;
area. The case of solid waste collection and disposal is somewhat&#13;
different from the other services here discussed, because public&#13;
provision of this service may not always result in the least-cost solution&#13;
Indeed, well-functioning systems of private collection, recycling and&#13;
disposal exists in some LDC cities, and their replacement by public&#13;
systems very likely would result in increased costs. The preferable&#13;
approach would be to support and strengthen the operations of the private&#13;
systems.&#13;
(iii) Public Provision of Shelter:l/&#13;
The public provision of shelter structures does not under most&#13;
circumstances, provide opportunities for cost saving as compared with&#13;
1/ This section draws especially on Grimes (1976), Payne (1977), and Vernez (1973).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 258 -&#13;
private provision. For low-cost shelter, the experience throughout&#13;
the cities of developing countries -- with the possible exception of&#13;
Hong Kong and Singapore, which will be discussed separately -- has&#13;
shown that private initiative in shelter construction tends to be preferable&#13;
to public shelter construction, since it provides an extremely efficient way&#13;
of using scarce resources in terms of adoption of appropriate standards and&#13;
technologies, mobilization of low i'ncome savings and investment, and utilization&#13;
of relatively abundant unskilled labor resources, while conserving scarce&#13;
1/&#13;
management, skilled labor, and capital resources.&#13;
With minor exceptions there exist relatively few externalities&#13;
or market imperfections in the urban low-cost construction sector, and&#13;
economies of scale in general do not prevail. In fact, it can be argued&#13;
that those market imperfections that do exist are imposed mainly by&#13;
public action, particularly legal housing standards, zoning requirements,&#13;
rent control and the like. Another important constraint on low-income&#13;
shelter construction is the lack of access to capital by low income&#13;
groups, because of lack of collateral, capital rationing as a result&#13;
of legal constraints on interest rates, lack of martgage instruments,&#13;
etc. Finally, the lack of accessible serviced land is yet another&#13;
factor in limiting low income housing construction. The appropriate&#13;
solution to these problems is not, however, to involve the public&#13;
1/ For example, in the case of the first urban development project&#13;
financed by World Bank in Manila, it was found according to preliminary&#13;
estimates that "private investment in substantial house construction&#13;
is being done by hired artisans and family labor at a cost per unit&#13;
of 20-50% below the cost of similar work when constructed using normal&#13;
contracting methods by the Government." (World Bank, 1978j, p. 7).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 259 -&#13;
sector in shelter construction. Rather, the distortions, constraints,&#13;
and bottlenecks can and should be directly addressed through elimination&#13;
or adaptation of regulations, through appropriate policies to assist&#13;
the development of a housing capital market which is accessible to the&#13;
poor, and the provision of land and services in accessible location.&#13;
Appropriate policies in the regulatory field will be discussed&#13;
below, the issues relating to land and services have already been treated,&#13;
and only a few words need to be said here about capital markets. One way&#13;
of providing capital for shelter construction is through housing construc-&#13;
tion loans in the context of urban development projects such as slum&#13;
upgrading and site and services projects, as is frequently the case in&#13;
the projects financed by the World Bank. In the case of the first urban&#13;
development project in Manila financed by the World Bank, it was found&#13;
that building materials loans contributed significantly to the stimulation&#13;
of private housing investment (World Bank, 1978j). In the same project,&#13;
it was furthermore found that with regularization of land titles and basic&#13;
service provision considerable amounts of informal capital (from relatives,&#13;
friends, etc.) became available to finance land acquisition charges and&#13;
shelter construction costs (World Bank, 1978d). This experience exemplifies&#13;
the importance of land title and service provision in stimulating capital&#13;
inflows to the low-cost, low-income construction sector. Finally, direct&#13;
public actions aiming at improved formal capital market operations may&#13;
also help, including the elimination of restrictive regulations on&#13;
commercial banks, and on savings and loans aaencies which prevent them from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 260 -&#13;
operating in the mortgage market.     These and other actions to promote&#13;
financial intermediartes for the housing capital market are useful,-&#13;
but low income households in most cases continue to have to rely on&#13;
informal capital markets and their own savings in financing shelter&#13;
construction. Experience with staged construction of poor income&#13;
housing and reliance on self-help and community help would tend to&#13;
indicate that this does not necessarily impose very serious constraints&#13;
on private shelter construction for low-income households.-/&#13;
There are thus no apparent reasons which would strongly&#13;
suggest that the public sector should be directly involved in the&#13;
construction of shelter for the urban poor. In fact, there are&#13;
numerous reasons and a broad range of experience to suggest that&#13;
public shelter construction does more harm than good. First, given&#13;
the heterogeneity of people's preferences as regards the kind of&#13;
shelter structure and the speed at which they can or want to improve&#13;
the quality of shelter, it is not surprising that public housing&#13;
projects often do not accord with the housing preferences of the poor&#13;
(high-rise apartment buildings constructed for the poor in Rio de Janeiro&#13;
are a good example; Perlman, 1976) and tend to distort their household&#13;
expenditures in favor of housing to an extent that other household&#13;
needs, especially food consumption, have to be seriously neglected&#13;
(Sudra and Thomas, 1976, cite case studies for Mexico City). Second,&#13;
1/ Grimes (1976) cites Turkish regulations preventing commercial banks&#13;
from making mortgage loans, and other examples of the more typical&#13;
practice of pegging interest rates artificially less.&#13;
2/ Excepting the provision of funds at subsidized rates (Grimes, 1976).&#13;
3/ See for instance Vernez (1973) for an evaluation of the experience&#13;
in Bogota.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 261 -&#13;
public investment in shelter substitutes for, and tends to impair private&#13;
savings and investment activities, since low, middle and high income&#13;
groups alike appear to be quite willing and able to finance privJate&#13;
housing construction commensurate with their ability to pay, provided&#13;
that complementary inputs into housing (especially tenure, space, and&#13;
services, and, to some extent, capital) are readily available. The public&#13;
resources spent on housing construction would be better used for providing&#13;
more of these complementary inputs. Third, high-cost public housing&#13;
units are usually preempted by high- and middle-income households, who&#13;
then also benefit from the subsidies generally provided with public&#13;
housing. These subsidies further tie up scarce public funds that could&#13;
otherwise have been used for the provision of serviced land. And to tne&#13;
extent that public housing construction programs bid up materials prices,&#13;
they tend to harm the self-help, low-cost, low-income construction sector.&#13;
Finally, public housing projects in the past were often ar.companied by&#13;
the razing or "eradication" of slums, which actually reduced the housing&#13;
stock and thus the supply of housing, and demolished the investments&#13;
of poor households, frequently without substituting feasible housing&#13;
alternatives.L/&#13;
The major exceptions to this generally negative experience&#13;
with public shelter construction are the low-income housing programs&#13;
of Hong Kong and Singapore. A number of factors contributed to their&#13;
success in providing a significant improvement in the housing for the&#13;

1975c) have been cited.&#13;

poor in those cities -/ (a) standards were chosen at levels that permitted&#13;
high-rise construction at costs affordable by the poor without substantial&#13;
subsidies; (b) the public housing units were culturally and socially&#13;
acceptable to the households in these two cities; (c) the programs&#13;
were operatted at such a large scale that they induced general rent&#13;
reductions throughout these two cities, and thus resulted in an important&#13;
"trickle-down" effect; (d) relatively high per capita incomes in these&#13;
two cities provided the fiscal basis for such a large scale program&#13;
and made standards affordable; (e) the lack oL readily urbanizable&#13;
land in these two cities had led to high densities and high land prices,&#13;
and made high-rise construction a necessary element of any large-scale&#13;
housing program; (f) both cities possessed the necessary management and&#13;
technical resources as well as strong metropolitan-wide governments&#13;
which permitted the implementation of such housing programs.&#13;
A similar combination of circumstances does not generally&#13;
exist in other cities in LDCs, possibly with the exception of Korea&#13;
and Taiwan. In fact, incomes are often at such low levels as to exclude&#13;
the possibility of large high-rise public housing programs for the&#13;
poor; they generally do not meet with the acceptance of the poor;&#13;
and finally, public management is a very scarce factor in most LDCs,&#13;
while urbanizable land at the metropolitan fringes tends to be more&#13;
readily available. Thus, the experience of Hong Kong and Singapore,&#13;
while reflecting tremendous achievements, does not provide a blue print&#13;
for public involvement in shelter construction in other cities of&#13;
developing countries.&#13;

b. Taxation and Service Pricing for Urban Housing&#13;
Taxation and public service pricing are important instruments&#13;
of urban housing policy for two reasons: Firstly, they directly affect&#13;
private decisions regarding the supply of and demand for housing attributes;&#13;
and secondly, they provide fiscal resources whose availability&#13;
at least in part determines the rate of expaTnsion in the stock of housing&#13;
attributes provided by the public sector. The subsequent paragraphs deal&#13;
only with those tax and pricing instruments which are related immediately&#13;
to the urban housing market in LDCs, i.e., porperty taxation and public&#13;
service charges.&#13;
(i) Property Taxation:-/&#13;
The incidence and revenue potential of property taxation were&#13;
treated in Chapter IV of this paper and need not be considered again.&#13;
Let it suffice to repeat that urban property taxation can, and in a&#13;
few LDC cities actually does play a major role in raising revenues for&#13;
urban governments without putting a major burden on the poor. Of interest&#13;
for the present discussion is the effect which property taxation is likely&#13;
to have on the supply of urban housing by affecting private decisions.&#13;
It is useful to start by discussing taxation of urban&#13;
land, i.e., a site value tax as it is found in some countries, such as&#13;
Jamaica, Kenya, and Taiwan. The imposition of a general land tax in&#13;
principle lowers the expected future yield stream on land and would&#13;
therefore reduce its present value. This lower land price may be&#13;
important for low income households who do not have access to a perfect&#13;
1/ For a more extensive treatment of the issues see Bahl and Linn&#13;
(forthcoming) and Shoup's paper in Dunkerley et al., (1978).&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 264 -&#13;
capital market, because it reduces the initial outlay required to&#13;
purchase land, and thus facilitates the acquisition of land for housing&#13;
To what extent in practice higher land taxes are capitalized into lower&#13;
land value has, however, not been empirically verified for LDC cities.&#13;
Evidence from industrialized countries is mixed, but on balance supports&#13;
the hypothesis that land tax capitalization occurs. While this may not&#13;
be the most important of arguments for urban land taxation, at least&#13;
it provides further support for this tax, since the likely impact of a&#13;
land tax on land prices would be favorable.&#13;
A somewhat different objective is usually pursued in the case&#13;
of differentially higher taxation of vacant urban land as compared&#13;
with built-up land. This type of tax is found in many LDC cities,-/&#13;
and is levied in order to encourage earlier release of vacant land&#13;
for subdivision and development.2/ Evidence for Taiwan suggests that&#13;
a tax on vacant land can indeed act as an inducement to land development&#13;
(Lent, 1976). Of course, the use of a vacant land tax presupposes&#13;
that vacant land is not developed at an optimal rate by the private&#13;
sector.  There is no universal agreement on whether or not private&#13;
land owners tend to withold land from the market beyond the time when&#13;
it should optimally be developed. In practice, however, one may be&#13;
able to identify certain zones within the urban periphery, where vacant&#13;
land would, prima facie, appear to involve a loss of economic opportunities.&#13;
1/ E.g., Taiwan, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Bolivia,&#13;
Botswana, Ivory Coast, Tunisia, Peru, Ecuador, Chile, Syria, Turkey,&#13;
and Senegal (Bahl and Linn, forthcoming).&#13;
2/ The tax would also tend to lower the price of vacant land before&#13;
development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 265 -&#13;
Vacant land taxes could therefore be deployed selectively to apply&#13;
to these zones.-/ Vacant land taxes can therefore serve as a tool to&#13;
support land use planning in urban areas. This however,&#13;
presupposes that a fairly sophisticated governmental planning apparatus&#13;
exists, which is obviously not the case everywhere. Therefore, vacant&#13;
land taxes should probably be used quite sparingly.&#13;
Besides taxation of land, property taxation generally also&#13;
involves the taxation of improvements (i.e., buildings).2/ Since the&#13;
tax on improvements reduces the rate of return which can be earned&#13;
from the capital invested in the buildings, this tax will provide a&#13;
disincentive to new cornstruction, as well as to maintenance of the&#13;
structure. It will also tend to reduce the capital value of the&#13;
improvement at the time of the imposition of the tax. The former&#13;
effect would reduce the supply of housing in the longer term; the latter&#13;
would permit easier access to homeownership for those who cannot easily&#13;
raise funds for home purchase in the capital market. As in the case&#13;
of land tax, no empirical verifications of these hypotheses are avail-&#13;
able for LDC cities, although they tend to be supported in general for&#13;
studies in the industrialized countries. In any case, as long as&#13;
property taxes are levied at rates as low as commonly found in LDCs,&#13;
there is little reason to suspect that elimination of the tax on&#13;
1/ The vacant land tax has been used in this way in Taiwan (Lent, 1976),&#13;
and also, until recently, in Bogota.&#13;
2/ Indeed, in some countries, or cities, heavier taxes are levied on&#13;
improvements than on land, e.g., in Rio de Janeiro, Seoul, and&#13;
a number of Zambian cities (Bahl and Linn, forthcoming).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 266&#13;
improvements would affect the supply of housing in any significant way&#13;
(Bahl and Linn, forthcoming). If, however, property taxation were to&#13;
become a more important revenue instrument for urban governments, as&#13;
is usually proposed, serious consideration should be given to increasing&#13;
only the tax on land, in order to avoid any disincentives on housing&#13;
supply.ll&#13;
T%o other forms of property taxation are generally discussed&#13;
in the literature: Taxes on land transfers are found in many countries&#13;
(Smith, 1977), but only in few cases contribute significantly to fiscal&#13;
resources.-/ Nevertheless, these taxes may significantly interfere&#13;
with the operation of the urban land market by raising the transactions costs.&#13;
This in turn tends to raise the cost of urban land for housing. These taxes&#13;
may also encourage evasion of official registration requirements, lead&#13;
to the under-reporting of sales prices, and thus throw a wrench into cadastral&#13;
and general property tax administration. Property transfer taxes are clear&#13;
candidates for abolition, especially where the revenue losses are of&#13;
only minor importance.&#13;
The other tax, which is at times advocated on efficiency and&#13;
equity grounds as a major alternative to the conventional tax on property,&#13;
is a tax on the increment in land value. Such a tax may be found in&#13;
Taiwan, in Korea, and in some industrialized countries, but its effects on&#13;
land prices and timing of land development, which are of major concern&#13;
here, do not appear to be unequivocally in the desired direction, either&#13;
1/ Short of a total revision of property taxation, this cannot be easily&#13;
implemented in countries where the property tax is levied on rental&#13;
value, rather than on capital value.&#13;
2/ In Korea, for example, these taxes have been important sources of&#13;
revenues for urban governments (Bahl and Linn, forthcoming).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 267 -&#13;
in theory or practice (Grimes, 1974). In any case, their administration&#13;
presents considerable practical difficulties, virtually ruling out this&#13;
tax in most LDCs (Bahl and Linn, forthcoming).&#13;
In summary, property taxes in general are not likely to have&#13;
a significant direct impact on urban housing.   Nevertheless, as a rule, one&#13;
should avoid high taxes on improvements, eliminate taxes on property&#13;
transfers, use special taxes on vacant land with caution, and view&#13;
proposals for land value increment taxation with suspicion.&#13;
(ii) User Charges&#13;
For the purposes of this paper user charges are broadly defined&#13;
to include all charges and levies imposed on the user or beneficiary&#13;
of a public service, if they bear some direct relationship to the&#13;
provision of this service, User charges therefore&#13;
include public utility tariffs; betterment levies and other plot charges&#13;
which are paid because of some public investment that conveys benefits&#13;
to a property; and land transfers from the private to the public sector&#13;
in exchange for public service provision.&#13;
User charges so defined are important instruments financing&#13;
publicly provided components of the urban housing supply. While all-&#13;
encompassing figures are not available, it is possible to glean the&#13;
extent (and variation) of the importance of user charges from different&#13;
data sources. Table VI-1 above, for instance, shows that utility&#13;
charges weigh heavily in the budgets of low income groups, but can&#13;
account for sizeable proportions (approximately 3 percent in Bogota,&#13;
and 5 percent in Korean cities) even for the middle income households.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 268 -&#13;
The same pattern of expenditure shares across income groups appears&#13;
in Table VI-10, which shows estimated expenditure shares for water&#13;
supply in a number of cities.-/ However, for some cities spending&#13;
on water increases as a proportion of income as one moves up in the&#13;
income distribution. This is explained in some of these cities, notably&#13;
Cartagena. and Bogota, by the fact that cross-subsidies from high- to&#13;
low-income consumers are part of the tariff schedules; for other cities,&#13;
especially Ahmedabad it results from the fact the figures shown&#13;
reflect property taxes, rather than user charges./    Notable is also&#13;
the large extent of variation in water charges across cities, with&#13;
Mexico City showing in general by far the lowest level.&#13;
Yet another indication of the potential -- and of the varying&#13;
extent of utilization -- of user charges is shown in Table VI-ll, which&#13;
reports the proportion of local government expenditures which is financed&#13;
by user charges in selected cities. / The importance of user charges&#13;
varies tremendously between cities: In some cities, more than half of&#13;
all expenditures are financed from user charges; yet in others, user&#13;
1/ The data in Table VI-10 are generated on the basis of rather sweeping&#13;
assumptions regarding household consumption patterns and income&#13;
distribution, and are therefore merely indicative of the general&#13;
range of budget shares.&#13;
2/ In India and Pakistan, but also in a number of other Asian countries,&#13;
water supply is predominantly financed from property taxes.&#13;
3/ In contrast to the previous two tables, user charges here reflect&#13;
the broad definition used in general in this paper. However, since&#13;
only local agency budgets are reflected in Table VI-ll, the full&#13;
extent of the contribution of user charges to public revenue cannot&#13;
be deduced even from this table.&#13;

charges make no contribution at all to local budgets. The reasons for&#13;
these variations are two-fold: Local governments have differing&#13;
expenditure responsibilities -- for example, local authorities in&#13;
Tunis and Kingston provide virtually no services for which user charges&#13;
can be levied, while in the Colombian cities local authorities are&#13;
responsible for a wide range of chargeable services. Another reason is&#13;
the differential extent of utilization of user charges -- for example,&#13;
the Colombian cities levy user charges for water supply, the Indian&#13;
cities finance water supply from property taxation.&#13;
The main point to be made on the basis of this rather motley&#13;
data base, and on the basis of general impressions and observations,&#13;
is that the potential of user charges fbr financing urban services in&#13;
general, and housing-related public investments in particular, is&#13;
considerable not only in theory, but also in practice. The question&#13;
then becomes how this potential is best realized in the interest of&#13;
providing services efficiently to the poor.&#13;
Beginning with the efficiency argument for users charges,&#13;
a strong prima facie case can be made for charging to the user or&#13;
beneficiary of public services the marginal cost which service provision&#13;
and use impose on the economy.l/ Subsidization, i.e., pricing services&#13;

tricity pricing; Sfeir-Younis (1977) for solid waste collection and&#13;
disposal pricing; and Walters (1969) for road user charges. These&#13;
sources deal extensively with the practical question of marginal&#13;
cost definition and measurement, wnich must vary from service to&#13;

below marginal cost, in general will result in consumption up to a&#13;
point where the private benefit derived from an additional unit of&#13;
consumption falls short of the cost which the provision of this&#13;
additional unit imposes on society.   It encourages location&#13;
at sites where the benefits derived from such location are below the&#13;
cost of providing the service there. By making the service user aware&#13;
of the opportunity cost of the service, marginal cost pricing encourages&#13;
him to avoid excessive use, and to consider the economic costs involved&#13;
in chosing his location of residence (or business). In principle,&#13;
therefore, differential service prices should be charged to consumers&#13;
and service beneficiaries if service provision to them is associated&#13;
with differential costs. On the other hand, where equal costs prevail,&#13;
individual service recipients should be charged equally. For example,&#13;
uniform utility tariffs which are frequently found across different&#13;
regions and cities are not likely to result in efficient provision and&#13;
use of services, since costs almost certainly vary across regions and&#13;
cities.-/ Under-pricing of public services in the large cities ma.i&#13;
in fact be one of the reasons for inefficiently rapid urban growth.2'&#13;
Similarly, within cities cost differentials can occur both across space,&#13;
and across time. Intra-city spatial cost differences result from&#13;
1/ For example, for water supply and sewerage services in nine cities&#13;
in Colombia a cost differential of 200 percent was observed between&#13;
the lowest cost city and the highest cost city (Linn, 1976a); see&#13;
also Saunders and Warford, 1976.&#13;
2/ The extent of the response of migrants and investors to public service&#13;
subsidies is not   empirically verified for LDCs (see Renaud, 1979).&#13;
However, there can be little doubt that in a case&#13;
like Mexico City, where water in particular is heavily subsidized&#13;
(one indication for this is given in Table VI-10 above for water supply),&#13;
the elimination of these subsidies would encourage a more efficient&#13;
growth pattern for the city and support official efforts to obtain&#13;
regional decentralization.&#13;

different densities and topological characteristics.-/ Seasonal demand&#13;
and cost variations occur especially for water and power services, and&#13;
daily peaks are very common for electricity.&#13;
Of course, there are practical limits to an attempt to reflect&#13;
cost differences in the pricing structure, since the determination of&#13;
cost differences and the application of differential cha_es involve&#13;
themselves resource costs as compared with the application of flat fees,&#13;
and these costs have to be balanced against the benefits derived&#13;
from a complex pricing structure. In broad terms one may conclude from&#13;
the experience in the water and power sectors (Saunders and Warford, 1976;&#13;
Turvey and Anderson, 1977) that regionally differentiated prices are&#13;
virtually always desirable; seasonal pricing for water may sometimes&#13;
be appropriate; daily peak-load pricing for electricity is generally&#13;
desirable only for large consumers, i.e. for industrial and commercial&#13;
consumers, but not for the typical residential connection, and especially&#13;
not for poor households; intra-city spatial differentiation of prices&#13;
may be desirable in those cases where cost differences are substantial,&#13;
and where equity arguments, which are further discussed below, do not&#13;
indicate otherwise.-/&#13;
A further, and related question is whether service use ought to&#13;
be metered at all, or whether instead flat charges or taxes should&#13;
be levied on all connections. Meters are costly in installation,&#13;
1/ Examples for water supply in Nairobi and Cali were cited above; there the&#13;
cost differentials result from the need for supplementary pumping&#13;
to higher lying areas.&#13;
2/ In Nairobi, where high-income households tend to live in high-cost&#13;
areas it may be desirable to charge them a higher price than in&#13;
the rest of the city (McLure, 1971); in Cali, where low-income&#13;
households are concentrated in the high-cost areas this may not be&#13;
desirable (Linn, 1976d).&#13;

maintenance and reading and their introduction is warranted only where&#13;
these costs are outweighed by the benefits associated with the reduction&#13;
in consumption. In Lahore, for instance, a thorough analysis of the&#13;
metering decision revealed that because of the low costs of water supply in that&#13;
city, installation of water meters was not warranted for residential connections&#13;
(Warford and Turvey, 1974). In other LDC cities, where water costs typically&#13;
are significantly higher, metering has generally been found appropriate,&#13;
although careful cost-benefit analyses were not frequently carried out.&#13;
The metering question is particularly complicated in the case of stand&#13;
posts. Unless the water is sold by attendants (which may well give rise&#13;
to monopoly rents as observed, for example, in Indonesia; World Bank, 1978e),&#13;
individual water charges cannot be used to encourage water conservation.&#13;
Intstead, alternative measures, such as flow-limiting devices must be&#13;
resorted to, although these have not been found universally successful.i'&#13;
While the charging for water and the reduction of water waste is an&#13;
import.ant practical problem to be addressed where stand posts are&#13;
tTh2c on a significant scale, it is generally not a problem that would&#13;
prewient altogether the introduction of standposts.&#13;
Returniing to the mainstream of the argument, the efficiency&#13;
imt.ar.t of user charges has so far only been discussed in terms of their&#13;
effctc von sc2rvice consumption and on location decisions. Marginal cost&#13;
pricing has, howevet, the further important benefit of providing a&#13;
guid for efficAent investment decisions by the public authorities.&#13;
1/ Saviidcrs and Warford (1976) discuss the spotty experience with&#13;
altern.ative devices . In some cases it has been&#13;
possible to make the community responsible for the payment of&#13;
use-r-elated standpost charges.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 275 -&#13;
As long as consumers are willing to pay for the incremental cost of&#13;
adding to service capacity, the benefits from increasing capacity are&#13;
at least as large as the costs incurred, and investment is therefore&#13;
warranted (Saunders et al., 1977).   On t' other hand, if no such&#13;
measuring rod is available, because services are subsidized, authorities&#13;
tend to have a hard time in determining whether the benefits outweigh costs,&#13;
since benefits are often difficult, if not impossible to estimate.&#13;
Moreover, since at subsidized prices excess demand is likely to be&#13;
generated for the service, the users whose demands are unsatisfied at&#13;
the prevailing low prices will strenuously argue for increased supplies,&#13;
although this may not be warranted on efficiency grounds. The same point&#13;
can be made with respect to the impact of user charges on service&#13;
standards. If users have to pay for the cost of the service according&#13;
to quality, they will chose that level of quality which is commensurate&#13;
with their abiliy and willingness to pay, and, what is more, public&#13;
agencies will have an incentive to provide services at standards reflecting&#13;
people's willingness to pay. Where subsidies are widely applied, this&#13;
incentive will generally be absent at the level of the household and&#13;
of the public agency. This, indeed, is probably one of the major reasons&#13;
why the World Bank has stressed the elimination of general subsidies&#13;
as a guiding principle in the design and implementation of its urban&#13;
development projects.&#13;
Another reason for eliminating subsidies relate to the fiscal&#13;
implications of user charges. Subsidies directly reduce the financial&#13;
resources available for service extension. They raise the cost&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 276 -&#13;
of service provision per household indirectly by encouraging service&#13;
standards in excess of willingness nd ability to pay of the beneficiaries,&#13;
and thus again reduce the possible service coverage, given the public&#13;
budget constraint. World Bank experience, especially irL the field&#13;
of public utility pricing, but also elsewhere in the housing field,&#13;
very strongly suggests that general subsidization of major housing&#13;
attributes not only leads to inefficiency in resource allocation, but&#13;
also to serious fiscal constraints on the public agencies, and thus&#13;
limits the extent to which public services can contribute to increases&#13;
in housing supply, especially for the poor.l/&#13;
Th.. case of water supply in Jakarta in the recent past has&#13;
provided a particularly drastic example (Linn, et al., 1976). The&#13;
failure to levy and enforce cost-covering charges has resulted in a dire&#13;
financial situation for the municipal water company, which therefore&#13;
was prevented from providing adequate service to its cu-stomers, and&#13;
from expanding service to new customers. Since customers' willingness&#13;
to pay was further eroded by poor service, a vicious circle was&#13;
set up, similar to the one discussed earlier in the case of bus fares.&#13;
As a contrasting example for effective user charges, one can&#13;
cite the experience with "valorization" charges in Bogota, Medellin,&#13;
and Cali (Colombia), and with the "land readjustment" schemes in Korean&#13;
cities. As mentioned previously, valorization charges are betterment&#13;
levies designed to recoup the cost of municipal infrastructure invest-&#13;
ments from the owners of properties whose values are enhanced by the&#13;

and Anderson (1977), World Bank (1973c).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
277 -&#13;
investment programs. In Bogota, for instance, valorization programs&#13;
have financed the construction of major arterial highways, of neighborhood&#13;
road improvements, and of major sewerage programs. The revenues raised&#13;
have been substantial and in some recent years have rivaled the local&#13;
property tax in importance (Doebele et al., 1979). Particularly&#13;
interesting is that component of the valorization program which is&#13;
designed specifically for the upgrading of streets in low-income neighbor-&#13;
hoods. This program relies on extensive community inputs, in terms of&#13;
initiation, planning, implementation, c2nd financing. It has made major&#13;
contributions to improving the accessibility of low income neighborhoods&#13;
in Bogota and has been the most consistent component of the valorization&#13;
program in terms of steady, self-financing growth (ibid.).&#13;
Land readjustment schemes in Korea involve the public arsembly of&#13;
numerous small parcels of raw land without paying monetary compensation to&#13;
the owners. This land is serviced and subdivided for urban use, and then&#13;
returned to the original owners in proportion to the value of their land&#13;
contribution. Some of the land is retained by the public authority and&#13;
sold at market prices to permit the recovery of the development cost. l/&#13;
The scale at which these schemes are carried out are impressive: As of&#13;
1976, some 45 percent of all urban land in Korea classified for "dwellin"&#13;
purposes was  covered by completed or ongoing land readjustment schemes.&#13;
While the system has evidently been successful in opening up new land&#13;
for urban uses, and thus has assisted significantly in increasing the&#13;

supply of housing and in raising public funds, it appears to have conveyed&#13;
its direct benefits mainly to middle- and high-income land owners. Only&#13;
to the extent that it reduced general urban land prices and rents below&#13;
the levels that would have prevailed in the absence of the scheme, may&#13;
some "trickle-down" effect have occurred, given the large scale of the&#13;
exercise. -/&#13;
So far the advantages of charging for services so as to cover&#13;
their incremental costs has been discussed without any direct reference&#13;
to externalities or equity, except to the extent that it was argued&#13;
that general subsidies in service pricing will tend to reduce service&#13;
access for the poor. However, a case can be made for selective subsidiz-&#13;
ation either on grounds of externalities, or on grounds of poverty&#13;
alleviation. Since the arguments for subsidies on grounds of externalities&#13;
overlap considerably with those for subsidies on grounds of poverty&#13;
alleviation, it is best to treat them jointly. The discussion will&#13;
focus on the issue of water supply pricing, but similar arguments could&#13;
be made for other services.&#13;
The main externality derived from improved housing supply is&#13;
the improvement in health which is associated with better services and&#13;
more space per household. Since one person's bad health may affect&#13;
other people's health, and may require public sector intervention in&#13;
providing curative health services, the social value of investments in,&#13;
and consumption of housing services is not adequately reflected by the&#13;

household's willingness to pay at low income levels. For water&#13;
supply, it has been fairly well established that a daily consumption&#13;
of 20 to 40 liters per capita per day (lcd) provides virtually all&#13;
possible health benefits that can be derived from safe water&#13;
(Kalbermatten et al.', 1978). An incentive should therefore be given to&#13;
consumers to encourage them to consume at least t:his amount of safe&#13;
water, in case they will not or cannot do so at their prevailing incomes.&#13;
This has been one of the major reasons for the introduction of the&#13;
so-called "life-line" tariffs in many developing countries.-/ Life-line&#13;
tariffs consist of a very low tariff for an initial consumption block&#13;
equivalent to, say, 20-40 lcd, while consumption lbeyond this amount is&#13;
charged at full marginal cost. Since water&#13;
consumers with house connections typically consume&#13;
more than 40 lcd even at low incomes (Table VI-12), the subsidy provided&#13;
by ;½ life-line tariff in practice is inframarginal to consumption,&#13;
but acts as an incentive for connection to the system. This is indeed&#13;
desirable, since consumption from standposts ofteni is at the lower limit&#13;
of the amoant required for health purposes (Table VI-12).2/&#13;
In fact, it may be argued that considera'bly more attention&#13;
should be focused on connection fees than has customarily been the case.&#13;
1/ According to Warford and Julius (1977) this Lype of tariff has been&#13;
adopted in 21 of the 36 developing countries that have borrowed from&#13;
the World Bank in the water supply sector anLd have metered connections.&#13;
2/ See also Warford and Julius (1977) who report that in one East African&#13;
city average consumption at standposts is only 14 lcd, while even for&#13;
the lowest income groups consumers use an average 100 lcd when they&#13;
have a house connecLion.&#13;

For a number of countries- / it has been shown that connection fees&#13;
are very high, and in some cases substantially exceed direct&#13;
connection costs, and that as a result connections especially by&#13;
low-income groups are discouraged. In Surabaya (Jakarta) the&#13;
minimum connection fee is twice the average connection cost (World&#13;
Bank, 1978e). In some Colombian cities it was found that new&#13;
consumers effectively subsidize existing consumers because of the&#13;
high connection fees charged (Linn, 1976a). This taxation of connection&#13;
fees counteracts any subsidies provided through life-line tariffs&#13;
and is particularly pernicious when these charges are lumpsum&#13;
charges that require immediate payment in full. Given the typical&#13;
lack of accumulated savings and the extremely limited access to&#13;
capital markets, poor households, which typically are not serviced&#13;
by in-house connections, are being effectively excluded from&#13;
connecting to the system, even where the layout of the system&#13;
permits them to do so. It is thus not surprising that Selowsky&#13;
(forthcoming)and Meerman (forthcoming) found for Colombia and&#13;
Malaysia that a significant nuiber of households without water&#13;
connections lacked access because of insufficient demand, rather&#13;
than because of insufficient supply.&#13;
The case of public service pricing in four Colombian cities&#13;
can serve as an example for the implications of utility tariffs which&#13;
involve extensive subsidies between consumers, but tend to exclude&#13;
new, usually low-income consumers by high connection fees. Table VI-13&#13;
1/ E.g., in Colombia (Linn, 1976a), Cameroon (World Bank, 1975d), and&#13;
Indonesia (World Bank, 1978e).&#13;

demonstrates that cross-subsidization between users permits redistribution&#13;
of income from the highest to middle-income groups, but the lowest two&#13;
population deciles benefit very little from this subsidy scheme, since&#13;
they are mostly not connected to the utilities.-/ Cali represents an&#13;
exception, since there the local utility enterprise has long engaged&#13;
in an aggressive program of system expansion, with subsidized connections&#13;
in low-income neighborhoods ensuring a near-universal effective demand&#13;
for connections. As a result, utility service coverage is high in Cali&#13;
and the cross-subsidies on service use reach down very low in the income&#13;
distribution scale.&#13;
The upshot of the preceding arguments is that one should be&#13;
careful not to counteract the effects of "life-line" rates -- which tend&#13;
to encourage connection --, by imposing high connection fees -- which&#13;
tend to discourage connection. There is, however, the different question&#13;
whether subsidization of connection will, for given fiscal resources, always&#13;
result in the largest possible in terms of improved public health or poverty&#13;
alleviation benefits. In cities of low income countries where large propor-&#13;
tions of the population are often not even served by standposts within reason-&#13;
able proximity to their houses, and where only middle and upper income groups&#13;
can afford to pay even for subsidized house connections, subsidized connections&#13;
benefit relatively high income groups and reduce the resources available to&#13;
provide standposts. In this setting, in-house connections should not be&#13;

subsidized (or at least not heavily), but instead standpost provision could&#13;
be subsidized in the interest of improved health and poverty alleviation.-/&#13;
Beyond the case of water supply, there are other examples&#13;
where selective subsidies can serve in the interest of efficiency and&#13;
poverty alleviation. World Bank projects have shown, for instance,&#13;
that in the context of sites and services and slum upgrading projects,&#13;
it is possible to levy differentially higher plot charges above cost&#13;
on particularly desirable losts, e.g., corner lots, easily accessible&#13;
lots, or lots designed for commercial and industrial use. The resulting&#13;
surplus can then be applied to lower charges on other plots, thus&#13;
permitting poorer income groups to bid for them than would otherwise&#13;
have been the case. For example, this type of cross-subsidization&#13;
made it possible that in one project component of the World Bank's&#13;
recent Morocco project 90 percent of all households in the project area&#13;
were expected to be able to afford to participate in upgrading; without&#13;
the cross-subsidization, only 70 percent could have afforded participation&#13;
(World Bank, 1978f).V&#13;
1/ While no hard evidence is available, it is reasonable to suspect that&#13;
the health improvement resulting from the provision of one standpipe&#13;
to, say, 100 households exceeds the health improvement that can be&#13;
obtained by upgrading service for one household from easy access to&#13;
a standpost to an in-house connection.&#13;
2/ Other examples include projects in Ivory Coast (World Bank, 1976b)&#13;
and the Philippines (World Bank, 1976e). A similar principle is also&#13;
adopted in the Colombian valorization scheme which was discussed&#13;
earlier. Cross-subsidization has made it possible to carry out major&#13;
valorization projects imvolving, among othe7 areas, also low-income&#13;
neighborhoods (Doebele   et al., 1979).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 285 -&#13;
Selective subsidization can thus improve projects designed to&#13;
provide better housing for the poor, but such subsidies must be carefully&#13;
designed and monitored to ensure that they do not accrtue to households&#13;
where no externality arguments apply, or who do not fall into the poverty&#13;
group, and to prevent such subsidies from undermining the financial&#13;
viability of the public agency providing the subsidized service. It is&#13;
furthermore important to bear in mind that major departures from conventional&#13;
practices in public service pricing generally have to be introduced&#13;
gradually. The arguments raised previously in the context of the insti-&#13;
tutional and political constraints on bus fare reform apply here with&#13;
equal force. Efficient, equitable, and fiscally sound user charges are&#13;
a goal that should be! worked towards, but there are practical limits&#13;
to the speed with which this goal can be reached.l/&#13;
c.  Regulations and Controls2/&#13;
Governments can, and often do attempt to guide urban development&#13;
in general, and the development of housing in particular, through the use&#13;
1/ The comparison of World Bank experience in two Indonesian cities is&#13;
instructive: In Jakarta, plot charges in slum upgrading did not&#13;
exist at the time that the first two projects were financed by the&#13;
World Bank. It was therefore decided to finance the projects by&#13;
improving the city's property tax system, which indeed happened. In&#13;
Surabaya, in contrast, where beneficiary contributions to defray the&#13;
cost of similar upgrading had an established history and acceptance,&#13;
such charges could in part be relied upon to finance the World Bank's&#13;
urban development project in that city. (World Bank, 1976d)&#13;
2/ This discussion of controls and regulations draws on Dunkerley&#13;
et al. (1978), where a more extensive treatment of the issues may&#13;
be found.&#13;

of various regulation and control instruments.   The experience in LDCs&#13;
in this area has not, in general, been very encouraging, however, because&#13;
of a lack of clear definition of goals for these instruments, a lack of&#13;
realism in their design and application, a lack of information which&#13;
would guide their use, a lack of manpower and skills for design and&#13;
implementation, and lack of political will or of control over corruption&#13;
to ensure implementation. This harsh indictment does not in most cases&#13;
reflect a lack of effort among LDC governments; instead, it reflects&#13;
the inherent weaknesses of these tools in an environment where these&#13;
tools are either inappropriate (e.g., rent control), or where the&#13;
resources for their design and implementation are extremely limited,&#13;
e.g., zoning, subdivision control, and building codes. There is some&#13;
evidence, however that regulation, control and planning are beginning&#13;
to be viewed in a more effective manner, in terms of a clearer goal&#13;
articulation, more realistic targets, and a greater readiness to limit&#13;
private property rights in the public interest (Dunkerley et al., 1978).&#13;
The following paragraphs will only very briefly review how some of the&#13;
instruments of regulation, control, and planning have contributed in the&#13;
past to aggravate the urban housing problems in LDCs by placing limits&#13;
on the speed with which housing supply could expand.&#13;
With the high density of urban development private decisions&#13;
regarding land use and building activity have important impacts not only&#13;
for the decision maker himself, but also for many others, households,&#13;
firms and government alike. In principle, the main goal of regulation&#13;

and control measures to is ensure that private decision makers behave in&#13;
a way which maximizes the social or external benefits and minimizes&#13;
the social or external costs associated with their actions.&#13;
Land use zoning, for examiple, traditionally has tried to&#13;
separate industrial from residential land uses in order to avoid&#13;
that residential areas suffer from noise, pollution, heavy traffic,&#13;
and the like. On the other hand, in LDC cities, in particular, zoning&#13;
regulations should be designed to encourage an adequate mix of residential,&#13;
commercial, and industrial uses, in order to increase access to employ-&#13;
ment opportunities for the poor and to reduce the need for public and&#13;
private outlays on transportation. The uncritical application of zoning&#13;
ordinances borrowed from advanced countries is likely to lead to an&#13;
overly segregated land use especially for low--income areas in the LDCs,&#13;
since at lower incomes lesser emphasis tends to be placed on environmental&#13;
and aesthetic qualities, and greater importance is given to ease of&#13;
access to employment.l/&#13;
Regulations and controls on subdivisions have the purpose of&#13;
ensuring that the layout of a neighborhood conforms with commonly&#13;
postulated standards regarding road space and design, lot size, and&#13;
public areas (parks, schools, playgrounds, etc.). They also have the&#13;
objective of guiding the timing and lcr.ation of urban development in&#13;
1/ Dunkerley et al. (1978) cite the case of Bangkok, where the recently&#13;
adopted new larid control law emphasizes conventional style zoning on&#13;
the basis of studies by local city planners of the practices in&#13;
Washington, D.C. and Paris.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 288&#13;
ways which are compatible with timely public infrastructure provision&#13;
at minimal costs. In principle, these regulations and controls are&#13;
again desirable, since neighborhood layouts are difficult and costly&#13;
to change after initial subdivision, and the cost of public infra-&#13;
structure provision can be greatly increased by inappropriate timing&#13;
and location or urban subdivisions. In practice, however, subdivision&#13;
regulations have generally been applied too inflexibly, requiring high&#13;
standards for space and services, and thus could not possibly be complied&#13;
with by the poor, who either had the option to engage in illegal&#13;
subdivisions and land invasions, or, where subdivision laws and owner-&#13;
ship rights were relatively strictly enforced (e.g., in Nairobi), to&#13;
crowd into the limited urban space, resulting in high rents and serious&#13;
over-crowding. In the end, none of the purposes of subdivision control&#13;
and regulation are served by this approach. Instead, a much more&#13;
flexible solution is required, where the government guides subdivisions&#13;
in terms of location and timing only to the extent that private households&#13;
have the resources to comply with the rules, and public agencies&#13;
have the resources to enforce them. Public regulatory action in this&#13;
area is closely linked with public land use development and service&#13;
provision polices and should therefore be explicitly coordinated with them.&#13;
Building codes are yet another prevalent form of regulation and&#13;
control of housing development. They are typically designed to reduce&#13;
fire and health lhazards, and to provide for privacy and open space. It&#13;
is obvious from housing conditions observable in slum areas of LDC cities&#13;
that the high standards which are frequently required in housing designi/&#13;
1/ In Turkey, for instance, German building codes were originally adopted&#13;
(Dunkerley et al., 1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 289 -&#13;
cannot and are not respected; and where they are, over-crowding of the&#13;
existing housing stock negates the benefits that might have been reaped&#13;
from the codes in the absence of over-crowding.&#13;
Since building codes, like most of the regulations regarding&#13;
land use and subdivision, are observed mainly in the breach, one may&#13;
feel inclined to regard them as largely innocuous and irrelevant.&#13;
However, they can have extremely undesirable impacts on the housing&#13;
conditions for the poor. Apart from resulting in over-crowding and&#13;
elevated rents that benefit a few property owners where the rules are&#13;
enforced, these regulations tend to lead to clouded land titles and&#13;
lack of secure tenure, they are used as legal instruments permitting&#13;
the bulldozing of low-income neighborhoods,-/ and they play a role in&#13;
determining the standards employed in public housing programs. A revision&#13;
of zoning and subdivision regulations and of building codes therefore&#13;
can be of primary importance in many cities of LDCs.&#13;
Another type of control frequently found are controls on rents.&#13;
Such controls exist for instance in India (Bahl, 1975; Mohan, 1974),&#13;
Egypt (Wheaton, 1978), and El Salvador (Fernandez-Palacios, 1978).&#13;
These controls are imposed ostensibly in order to restrain rents where&#13;
these hawe risen rapidly as a result of turban growth and of the failure&#13;
of housing supply to keep up with housing demand. This is one particularly&#13;
1/ A somewhat different phenomenon has occurred in San Salvador: low-income&#13;
rental units called "mesones" cannot legally be reconstructed or repaired,&#13;
resulting in a decline of their quality (Fernandez-Palacios, 1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 290 -&#13;
unfortunate attempt to solve a problem by limiting its symptoms and&#13;
thereby to make matters worse. Despite the fact that rent controls are&#13;
frequently circumvented by illegal payments between owner and renter&#13;
(Mohan, 1974; Wheaton, 1978), the return to housing investment and&#13;
maintenance becomes more uncertain, and where owners do adhere to the&#13;
law, the return is lowered in absolute terms. Therefore, the&#13;
willingness of owners to invTest in new buildings or maintain old&#13;
structures tends to be reduced.- Furthermore, since illegal rent payments&#13;
frequently take the form of lumpsum payments at the beginning of the&#13;
tenancy, low-income households which do not have access to capital, are&#13;
disadvantaged.-!/ Another problem has arisen in El Salvador, where low-&#13;
income households are frequently evicted because prevailing rent control&#13;
laws permit higher rentals only at a time when tenants change (Fernandez-&#13;
Palacios, 1978).  Finally, in countries where property taxes are levied&#13;
on rental values, the controlled rents generally must be used as a basis&#13;
of tax assessment. This reduces significantly the level and buoyancy of&#13;
property tax revenues (Bahl, 1975), and thus limits the ability of local&#13;
authorities to expand public services. The housing shortage, which&#13;
initially was the reason for the introduction of rent control, is therefore&#13;
only made worse.&#13;
1/ For Egypt, for example, qualitative evidence indicates that the&#13;
housing stock has suffered from the existence of rent controls&#13;
(Wheaton, 1978; World Bank, 1978c).&#13;
.2/ The reduction in mobility as a result of lumpsum   rent payments has&#13;
already been mentioned.&#13;

D. Urban Development Projects: A Tentative Review of Recent&#13;
World Bank Experience&#13;
At the time of the preparation of the World Bank's Housing&#13;
Seccor Policy Paper (World Bank, 1975e) only ten projects in the area&#13;
of urban housing and development had,been appraised and approved for&#13;
financing by the World Bank. As of June 1978, twenty-nine urbanization&#13;
projects had been processed, among them six projects which constituted&#13;
follow-ups on earlier projects and thus built on the experience gathered&#13;
during the implementation of these earlier efforts. Moreover, a major&#13;
in-depth monitoring and evaluation program of selected urban projects&#13;
has been underway for three years and routine monitoring and evaluation&#13;
components have been included for virtually all urban projects. As a&#13;
result a considerable body of evidence has been compiled regarding the&#13;
feasibility of the basic elements of the strategy which was outlined&#13;
originally in the World Bank's Urbanization Sector Working Paper&#13;
(World Bank, 1972b) and further developed in the Housing Sector Policy&#13;
Paper (World Bank, 1975e). Much of this evidence needs yet to be sifted&#13;
through carefully and a full-fledged evaluation is clearly beyond the&#13;
scope of this paper, but a few tentative ideas can be presented here&#13;
regarding the World Bank experience in designing low-income housing&#13;
programs.&#13;
Between mid-1972 and mid-1978 the World Bank assisted 23&#13;
developing countries to provide approximately 190,000 sites and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 292 -&#13;
service lots, and to improve some 1.5 million lots through urban&#13;
upgrading efforts. Assuming six persons per lot, which is likely too err&#13;
on the conservative side, over 10 million people were expected to&#13;
benefit from these projects at a total project cost of about US$1.3 billion.l/&#13;
Shelter components (sites and services, upgrading and off-site infras-&#13;
structure for shelter sit:es) accounted for 52 percent of total costs,&#13;
special transport and other infrastructure investments for 22 percent,&#13;
community facilities (including schools, health facilities, and related&#13;
programs) for 8 percent, and employment support programs for 7 percent.&#13;
Technical assistance outlays added another 10 percent to make up total&#13;
cost (Table VI-14).-   These projects will be reviewed briefly in terms&#13;
of their ability to reachL the poor, their affordability and their replicability.&#13;
The projects' ability to reach the poor is defined quite narrowly&#13;
for the purposes of this preliminary evaluation. It is merely concerned&#13;
with how far down in the income distribution the projects were expected&#13;
to reach, and thus to provide improved housing for the urban poor. The&#13;
first three columns of Table VI-16 show this information and provide&#13;
a comparison with conventional public housing programs in the countries&#13;
where the projects were carried Qut.-    The data show that the World Bank&#13;

drawn from a preliminary survey of appraisal reports by C. Clifford.&#13;
2/ Table VI-15 shows total project costs as at appraisal by project&#13;
and the percentage breakdown of costs by major components.&#13;
3/ The percentile figures are approximate and show only minimum&#13;
values. They do not imply that all benefits of the projects and&#13;
programs were actually concentrated at these percentiles in the&#13;
income distribution.&#13;

financed projects were designed to reach considerably lower income groups&#13;
than did the conventional housing programs in all countries.-/ They&#13;
also show that upgrading programs tend to have a better record than sites&#13;
and service projects in terms of their poverty impact, although the&#13;
difference is not always significant,&#13;
The interesting questions are, of course, how this goal was&#13;
achieved and to what extent the projects are replicable. The&#13;
poverty ±mpact was not, irn general, achieved by extensive subsidization&#13;
of beneficiaries. In fact9 as columns (4) and (5) of Table VI-16 indicate,&#13;
with the exception of the Indonesian case, which will be discussed separately,&#13;
all of the projects l.Lsted have aimed at substantial, if not full recovery&#13;
of shelter costs from plot holders.-/ In contrast, conventional public&#13;
housing programs have been supported by significant subsidies, as shown&#13;
in column (6) of Table VI-16. This conclusion is confirmed by columns&#13;
(7) and (8) of the same table, which indicate that nominal interest&#13;
rates charged in World Bank projects were frequently above those charged&#13;
in conventional housing programs. About half of the&#13;
projects shown in Table VI-16 relied on subsidies internal&#13;
to the project (column 10).        With only few exceptions&#13;
1/ For the case of Indonesia, one needs to add, however, that the projects&#13;
financed by the World Bank were a continuation of the Kampong Improvement&#13;
Program in Jakarta, which had been initiated by Indonesian authorities&#13;
in 1969 and served as a model for the efforts which were supported by&#13;
the World Bank starting in 1974.&#13;
2/ Community facilities, special project components not related to shelter&#13;
provision, and technical assistance overheads were generally not&#13;
recovered by plot charges, although in some projects some of these&#13;
cost items were charged to plot holders.&#13;

plot charges were not expected to exceed 25 percent of household income&#13;
among the intended beneficiary groups.providing an indication of the&#13;
affordability of the projects to the target groups.&#13;
The key to this achievement lay in the drastic reduction&#13;
of costs per plot as compared with those of conventional public housing&#13;
programs, as can be -;en from the last four columns of Table VI-17.&#13;
This cost reduction in turn was feasible because of red.iced standards.&#13;
World Bank projects generally do not involve the construction of complete&#13;
house, although some of the sites and service projects pronwide so-called&#13;
core structures, i.e., minimum structures for sanitary facilitics on&#13;
the lot ("wetcores"), or, for higher cost lots, minimal one-room structures&#13;
("core units"). Upgrading project components have not in general provided&#13;
any structures (the first Calcutta project in 1973 is the only exception),&#13;
although material loans were made available in approximately half of&#13;
them. This difference betweeni sites and services components and upgrading&#13;
components explains to a large extent the fact that the former are&#13;
usually more expensive than the latter, and that therefore without subsidies&#13;
the former are not affordable to households at incomes as low as is the&#13;
case with upgrading projects. The tendency of World Bank financed&#13;
urbanization projects to place increasing emphasis on upgrading components,&#13;
rather than sites and service components, as indicated by the changing&#13;
cost shares of these two types of approaches (Table VI-14), reflects&#13;
the growing awareness that in many cities upgrading projects provide a&#13;
feasible way of assisting a substantially greater number of households.&#13;

Other sources of cost savings in urbanization projects financed&#13;
by the World Bank have been the frequent adoption of communal water supply&#13;
facilities, i.e., standposts, and of non-waterborne sewerage disposal&#13;
systems; reduced lot size as compared with conven.ional public housing&#13;
programs; and lower-cost circulation standards (i.e., heavier reliance&#13;
on footpaths, rather thani streets). Standards and costs generally were&#13;
lower in projects carried out in the Low Income countries (i.e., in most&#13;
of Sub-Saharan Africa and of Low Income Asia). This difference is dictated&#13;
by the extremely low levels of per capita incomes among the urban poor in&#13;
these country groupings and reflects the sensitivity of project design&#13;
to the different levels of ability and willingness to pay.&#13;
The replicability of urbanization projects, and thus their&#13;
ability to reach all or most of the urban poor over time, depends to&#13;
a large extent on how low standards and therefore costs are set, and&#13;
on the extent to which costs are recovered from project beneficiaries.&#13;
However, these are not the only constraints on replicability, as some&#13;
of the World Bank projects have shown. One problem relates to the&#13;
availability of raw land for sites and service projects in reasonable&#13;
proximity to employment opportunities. Project replication may involve&#13;
higher land costs which in turn adversely affect the affordability&#13;
of the project by the poor income groups, or it may require a more&#13;
distant location fromt employment opportunities, In this case the attractive-&#13;
ness of the project to low-income groups is reduced, unless transport&#13;
improvements accompany the project, or new employment opportunities&#13;
&#13;

are generated close to the project site.-/ A somewhat different problem,&#13;
also involving the issue of land, affects the replicability of upgrading&#13;
projects. As was discussed earlier, tenure regularization tends to be&#13;
easiest where slums are located on public lands. Usually, these areas&#13;
are therefore tackled first in upgrading programs. When follow-up&#13;
projects then have to turn to squatters on private land, the whole&#13;
question of tenure regularization becomes more difficult to deal with,&#13;
and will generally involve greater political obstacles, danger of delays,&#13;
and budgetary costs, than was the case initially.&#13;
Another limitation on the replicability of low-cost housing&#13;
programs, even where costs are fully recovered in the long term, is&#13;
the problem of limited availability of -apital for such programs in&#13;
the short run. The government's overall housing strategy is important&#13;
in this context: As long as scarce capital is devoted to major high-cost&#13;
housing programs, the availability of funds for low-cost housing projects&#13;
is obviously limited and the pace and scale of replication of such&#13;
programs is considerably impaired.2'&#13;
Finally, the ability of housing agencies and of other related&#13;
governmental units to raise revenues from other sources is a crucial&#13;
determinant for the replicability of low-cost housing programs, not only&#13;
because it governs the availability of funds of the provision of shelter&#13;
and related services, but also since it determines the extent to which&#13;
1/ The example of San Salvador has already been cited.&#13;
2/ Other, more indirect effects, such as higher materials prices, ma-;7&#13;
add to the problem.&#13;

complementary components can be implemented, such as community facilities,&#13;
employment support components, and techniical assistance, the costs of&#13;
which are not usually recouped directly from the beneficiaries. A&#13;
strengthening of the fiscal base of local governments in particular is&#13;
of central importance and has been of concern in various of the World&#13;
projects (e.g., in Kenya, India, the Philippines, and Indonesia).&#13;
The Indonesian experience with low-income housing programs&#13;
is a particularly interesting example for a number of reasons. The&#13;
so-called "Kampong Improvement Program" began in 1969 in Jakarta as&#13;
an attempt by Indonesian authorities to deal on a large scale with&#13;
the overwhelming slum problems in that city. The scale of the program&#13;
was indeed impressive. During its first phase (1969-74) approximately&#13;
20 percent of the slum areas (Kampongs),/ were upgraded, 16.5 percent&#13;
during the second phase (1974-76), and a further 25 percent are expected&#13;
to be upgraded during the third phase (1976-79), providing improved&#13;
infrastructure and communication of some 61.5 percent of all s.lum areas&#13;
in Jakarta over a ten year period (World Bank, 1978e). The number of&#13;
plots and households involved in this program is very large (see Table VI-17),&#13;
and there apparently has been a notable improvement in the overall&#13;
housing conditions in that city, not only in terms of improved service&#13;
availability, but also in terms of reduced overcrowding (World Bank, 1978e).&#13;
The standards and costs of services provided were very low (as indicated&#13;
in Table VI-16), but nevertheless included the provision of paved&#13;

footpaths, roads, drainage, water supply, sanitation, primary schools&#13;
and health clinics. In a departure from usual World Bank practice,&#13;
project costs were not directly recovered from project beneficiaries,&#13;
but were borne by the local government in Jakarta,-/ which initiated&#13;
a major effort to increase its fiscal resources, especially through&#13;
significant improvements in property taxation. As a result, property&#13;
tax resources ilicreased more than 14 fold between 1971 and 1975 --&#13;
admittedly from a very low base -- and all locally raised revenues&#13;
(i.e., excluding transfers from the national government) increased&#13;
more than fourfold during the same period (World Bank, 1976d). In summary,&#13;
the Kampong Improvement Program in Indonesia provides a unique example&#13;
of the potential for improvement in low-income housing conditions even&#13;
where average incomes are quite low, as is the case in Indonesia.&#13;
World Bank experience can also throw light on the question&#13;
to what extent the efficiency and equity (poverty alleviation)&#13;
objectives can jointly be furthered through low-cost urbanization&#13;
projects. Table VI-18 records the estimated rates of return on the&#13;
sites and services, upgrading and industrial/commercial development&#13;
components of the urbanization projects financed by the World Bank.&#13;
1/ In this case, this can be justified by the low unit costs of the&#13;
project, compared to the costs of collection of charges; and by&#13;
the fact that the improved property tax system actually led to an&#13;
indirect cost recovery from beneficiaries, since the property&#13;
value base was promptly reassessed especially in the upgraded&#13;
areas (Linn et al., 1976).&#13;

In most cases it is found that the project rates of return are above&#13;
reasonable estimates of the opportunity cost of capital in these countries,&#13;
which is likely to fall somewhere in the range of 10-15 percent. The&#13;
estimation procedures for these rates of return are necessarily rough,l/&#13;
but if anything they tend to underestimate the benefits derived from&#13;
these projects, since they cannot measure the external benefits that&#13;
are generated, in particular the improvements in public health, which&#13;
are one of the primary goals of these projects, One may therefore conclude&#13;
that programs to improve the housing conditions of the urban poor through&#13;
the provision of low-cost services in general do not appear to involve a&#13;
trade-off between efficiency and equity, since both objectives are served by&#13;
these projects.2/&#13;
The experience with urbanization projects financed by the World&#13;
Bank also extends to other areas, such as the recognition that it is&#13;
important to address the urban poverty problem not only by focusing&#13;
on improvementsin the physical infrastructure, but that complementary&#13;
components, in particular transport improvements, better&#13;
public utility system, and provision of basic social services, i.e.,&#13;
education, health, nutrition and family planning, must be part of an&#13;
overall strategy of improving the welfare of the urban poor. Integrated&#13;
1/ They rely on estimated increases in rental or capital values of the&#13;
improved lots.&#13;
2/ A recent ex post analysis of the economic rates of return in a sites&#13;
and services project financed by the World Bank in El Salvador&#13;
confirmed the results of the ex ante estimates shown in Table VI-18&#13;
above. The ex post rates of return fell between 28 and 33 percent&#13;
(Fernandez-Palacios, 1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

urban development projects, which encompass many of these components&#13;
therefore are now the rule, rather the exception, and what preliminary&#13;
experience is available, particularly from repeater projects as in&#13;
Indonesia and the Philippines, indicates the general validity of this&#13;
approach. Other lessons from experience have included the realization&#13;
of the importance of community participation in project design and&#13;
implementation, and of a focus on the important role which womer play&#13;
in any attempt to improve the lot of the urban poor in LDCs. However,&#13;
beyond these general comments, and some specific points concerning&#13;
community participation and the role of women which are raised at&#13;
various places in this paper, it is too early to attempt a comprehensive&#13;
evaluation of World Bank experience in these areas.-/&#13;

VII. SOCIAL SERVICES: EDUCATION, HEALTH&#13;
NUTRITION, AND FAMILY PLANNING&#13;
A. The Social Service Systetn: Components and interactions&#13;
Public involvement in the provision of social services,&#13;
especially those relating to education, health, nutrition and family&#13;
planning, is a well-establiahed practice in all LDCs. The importance&#13;
of these services in terms of their effects on labor productivity ars. on&#13;
the human welfare of the urban poor, the differential social service needs&#13;
of urban, as compared with rural dwellers, and the traditionally heavy&#13;
emphasis on social service provision in urban, as against rural areas,&#13;
make it important to review the major policy issues in this area.&#13;
The starting point of any discussion of urban social services&#13;
must be to emphasize the close interrelationships among all the services&#13;
considered here, as well as their links with other aspects of the urban&#13;
economy, cnd especially with other urban services. Figure VIt-1&#13;
shows a schematic representation of these linkages, which will briefly&#13;
be discussed as a basis for the ensuing analysis of policy issues&#13;
relating to each of the major social services.&#13;
Beginning with education and its relationship to other social&#13;
services, it is well established that.higher general levels of education&#13;
tend to be associated with lower fertility levels (Boulier, 1977;&#13;
Visaria and Newlon, 1974; Anker, 1978);&#13;
moreover, family planning programs need to be complemented by specific&#13;
education and training efforts £or the family planning clients and&#13;
.for the staff in charge of the services. At the same time, reduced&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 308 -&#13;
fertility lowers the demands on the educational system of a country&#13;
due to the resulting decline in the school-age population; at the&#13;
household level, it has been found that there is a negative correlation&#13;
between family size and the IQ of each additional child (Boulier, 1977).&#13;
Education and training programs are essential in improving nutritiorial&#13;
practices especially among low income women, particularly as regards&#13;
instruction on the value of breast feeding and on the preparation of&#13;
balaniced and uncontaminated food for infants and children. Schools&#13;
have also customarily been used as a conduit to improve the nutrition&#13;
of children, e.g. through school feeding programs, milk distribution,&#13;
etc. At the same time, it is well known that poor nutrition affects the&#13;
ability of children to benefit from educational programs; furthermore,&#13;
child feeding programs can be used as an incentive for poor families to&#13;
send their children to school. Similarly, an important dimension of&#13;
any health program must be educational efforts to improve personal hygiene&#13;
and health-related family practices; in turn, improved health will&#13;
increase school attendance and the ability and motivation of children&#13;
to learn (World Bank, 1975a).&#13;
The links between health, nutrition and family planning are&#13;
particularly close, making it a cluster of urban service provision which&#13;
is best treated as one single sector. Improved health as measured by&#13;
reduction in miorbidity or increase in life-expectancy is known to lead&#13;
to a rec1.uction in fertility, albeit with a variable time-lag (Visaria and&#13;
Newlon, 1974; World Bank, 1975a). On the other hand, a reduction in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 309 -&#13;
household size tends to increase overall family health (Boulier, 1977),&#13;
and more specifically, the reduction in the number of births and an increased&#13;
spacing of children contribute to improved maternal and infant health&#13;
and nutrition (Boulier, 1977; World Bank, 1975a). Poor nutrition is a&#13;
major cause in increasing susceptibility to illnesses, and malnutrition&#13;
is itself a major cause of morbidity and death. At the same time, certain&#13;
illneoses, especially those affecting the gastro-intestinal tract reduce&#13;
the ability of the human body to absorb a given nutritional intake and&#13;
others (especially fevers) are associated with excessive calory losses.&#13;
The role of women, infants, and children is central in this&#13;
education-health-nutrition-family planning complex: Maternal pre- and&#13;
post-natal health and nutrition, as well as maternal health and nutrition&#13;
practices directly affect the health and nutrition level of the infant&#13;
and thus its chance for survival during the critical first year, and&#13;
determine indirectly the infant's future health and intellectual capacity&#13;
(Selowsky, 1976). Social service programs should therefore be designed&#13;
to reach especially this crucial target group (Reutlinger and Selowsky,&#13;
1976; Selowsky, 1978).&#13;
Besides the linkages internal to the system of education,&#13;
health, nutrition, and family planning, there are important linkages&#13;
between individual social services and other factors. For instance,&#13;
improved sanitation (water supply, sewerage, and solid waste disposal)&#13;
has important impacts on the health of the urban population, but these&#13;
health benefits can only be reaped in full, if improved sanitation is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 310 -&#13;
combined with educational measures aimed at improving the personal hygiene&#13;
of urban dwellers (World Bank, 1975). The quality of housing and in&#13;
partictular the extent of crowding, is closely related to health, since&#13;
at high levels of crowding the likelihood of contamination and disease&#13;
communication is consideredly increased (Golladay and Koch-Weser, 1974).&#13;
The physical accessibility of education, health and family planning&#13;
facilities is especially important for the urban poor (Basta, 1977), calling&#13;
either for a community-level provision of these services or improvements&#13;
in the urban transportation system.&#13;
Finally, probably the most important external linkage of the education-&#13;
health-nutrition-family planning complex is its relationship to the level&#13;
of income. Higher incomes, at the household, city, and national level,&#13;
are associated with significantly improved levels of education, health,&#13;
nutrition and family planning in a pattern of two-way causation; better&#13;
education, health, nutrition and family planning increase productivity&#13;
and reduce the drain on 1hcusehold resources associated with poor health&#13;
and large household size; in contrast, higher incomes permit greater&#13;
household, city and national expenditures to achieve and maintain good&#13;
education, health and nutrition levels and may directly affect&#13;
the parental decisions regarding reproduction. Indeed, what for a poor&#13;
family is a vicious circle  of low incomes inducing poor education, health,&#13;
nutrition and family planning, leading in turn to low incomes, is for&#13;
a high-income family a self-reinforcing circle of high income breeding&#13;
good education, health, nutrition and family planning, and vice versa.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 311 -&#13;
The main policy question is therefore how to help the&#13;
poor to break out of the vicious cycle in which they find&#13;
themselves. The rationale behind such a policy is not only an ethical&#13;
one, i.e., the alleviation of poverty, but also one of efficiency. The&#13;
synergistic interactions of education, health, nutrition, and family&#13;
planning imp21y  that private and public resources -- food, educational,&#13;
health, and sanitation services as well as family planning efforts --&#13;
are largely wasted unless a comprehensive effort is made to assist the poor to&#13;
break out of the vicious circle in which they find themselves. In fact,&#13;
public intervention in the field of social services is most appropriate&#13;
in the case of the urban poor, but much less necessary among the better&#13;
off. The poor are particularly affected by lack of information -- as&#13;
regards health, nutrition and family planning --, and are especially&#13;
unable to utilize cost reductions associated with economies to scale.&#13;
Furthermore, given the importance of negative externalities in the&#13;
vicious cycle of low income, education, health, nutrition, and fertility&#13;
which were identified above, public intervention is crucial. Related&#13;
to this point is another: subsidies in the provision of social services&#13;
for the poor carn be justified on the basis of economic externalities&#13;
of the social service system, in addition to the justification derived&#13;
from the normative concept of basic needs. Efficiency and equity concerns&#13;
therefore overlap very closely in this field.&#13;
Before turning to a detailed evaluation of social service policies,&#13;
three further general comments should be made: First, as with all urban&#13;
public services, particular attention must focus on ways and means to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 312 -&#13;
reduce the cost of service provision by looking for efficient, low cost&#13;
service standards and by an improvement in organization and management.&#13;
Second, many of the policy recommendations for social services cut across&#13;
the urban-rural classification, and in this respect are not special to&#13;
the urban environment. Nevertheless, there are a number of significant&#13;
differences between the rural and urban social service system&#13;
to warrant a separate discussion in the urban context. Finally, many&#13;
of the policy decisions effecting social service provision are taken&#13;
at the level of the national, or at Least provincial government, rather&#13;
than at the city level. However, as will be argued below, local authorities&#13;
and communities should be encouraged to participate in the planning and&#13;
delivery of these services for poor communities, and in many countries&#13;
and cities they already do so, thus creating room for city-level initiative&#13;
and action.&#13;
B. Education&#13;
1. The Policy Setting and Issues&#13;
The post World War II period has seen a rapid expansion of&#13;
education services throughout the World, including the LDCs, where education&#13;
has long been thought of as providing a way out of collective, as well as&#13;
individual poverty (World Bank, 1974a). Public education expenditures have&#13;
become important in many countries when measured in relation to GNP (among&#13;
LDCs, Algeria reached the highest proportion of 7 percent of GNP; World&#13;
Bank, 1974a, Table 3). For a number of LDCs, education absorbed more than&#13;
a quarter of all public expenditures (World Bank, 1974a), and in various&#13;
LDC cites urban governmento spent over a quarter of their budgets on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 313 -&#13;
education-related services (Bahl and Linn, forthcoming). As a result&#13;
student enrollments rose rapidly in most LDCs and considerable advances&#13;
were made in terms of improving student enrollment ratios at all levels&#13;
of education, reducing illiteracy, and creating, in some countries at&#13;
least, considerable domestic science elites which compete very vigorously&#13;
with the scientific establishments in the industrialized countries.-/&#13;
However, it appears that the enthusiasm with which the heavy&#13;
emphasis on education was embraced in the LDCs during the 1950s and 1960s&#13;
has waned during the 1970s as it became apparent that education is,&#13;
after all, not a panacea for the probelms of the LDC, at least not as&#13;
it was designed during the first 25 years after World War II. One of&#13;
the problems incurred in some countries was the rising unemployment rate&#13;
among the better educated portion of the LDC population (Phillips, 1978)&#13;
coupled with the brain-drain experienced in many LDCs.&#13;
Another problem which began to become apparent during the early&#13;
1970s was that, despite the great advances which were made in most LDCs,&#13;
many of them, and especiall, the low-income countries, were "approaching&#13;
the limits of their financial c,apability without having achieved even a&#13;
minimum education for the majority of their populations"' (World Bank, 1974a,&#13;
p. 28).&gt;&#13;
Finally, it also became clear that while some sections of the&#13;
population in LDCs made considerable progress in terms of educational&#13;
1/ India's achievements in the nuclear and medical science fields are&#13;
two of the most notable examples.&#13;
2/ The importance of the overall resource constraint in limiting the&#13;
potential of reaching conventional edtucation goals in a representative&#13;
LDC was also demonstrated by Hultin and Jallade (1975).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 314 -&#13;
achievements, large segments were affected very little by the education&#13;
efforts. Not surprisingly, these were mainly the rural poor, but also&#13;
to a considerable extent the urban poor.   All forms of higher&#13;
education were found to benefit mainly the higher income categories,&#13;
in terms of the benefit of access -- i.e., mainly the children of high-&#13;
income parents manage to enter higher education and thus derive the fiscal&#13;
dividend in terms of increased future earnings above cost incurred --&#13;
and in terms of benefitting from the substantial subsidies generally&#13;
accorded to higher education.-/ Primary education expenditure was found&#13;
to be generally distributed in favor of lower income groups (at least&#13;
relative to the existing income distribution), and in fact sufficiently&#13;
so to make the overall incidence of education spending and financing&#13;
progressive in the sense of providing low income households with greater&#13;
net subsidies relative to their incomes than those accorded to the rich.2/&#13;
In absolute terms, however, the high income groups received an equal or&#13;
even larger net subsidy than the poor.    If returns to education are&#13;
a function of absolute spending per child, then there can be little doubt&#13;
that conventional education in the LDCs has mainly helped to strengthen&#13;
the position of those groups that are already well-educated.3/ Since&#13;
early drop-outs are particularly prevalent among low income groups, and&#13;
a certain number of years are required to convey a minimum amount of&#13;

conventional education, the benefits derived by the (poor) drop-out are&#13;
even lower than the already low expenditvures made on,his behalf.&#13;
In sum, a number of observers recently began to question the&#13;
efficacy of conventional education in reaehing broad development goals,&#13;
a view which is reflected in the following statement by Harbison (1977,&#13;
p. 149):&#13;
"Clearly, the overall design of the strategy for development&#13;
will be the major force determining labor force mobility,&#13;
alleviation of low-end poverty and narrowing of income variances.&#13;
Education and learning programs have only minor impacts. A&#13;
country's learning system is logically derived from an overall&#13;
development strategy based upon explicit or implied goals; it&#13;
is seldom the initiating force in the building of such a&#13;
strategy."&#13;
Beside suggesting that education be placed in the overall&#13;
context of development objectives and strategies as one of many policy&#13;
instruments, it was also increasingly realized that the education system&#13;
itself needed to be restructured in order to attain the goals of improved&#13;
efficiency and equity in development (World Bank, 1974a).&#13;
2. Increasing the Efficiency of the Education System&#13;
Research on the social rates of return to different levels of&#13;
education in LDCs has demonstrated (a) that primary education has a social&#13;
rate of return usually substantially in excess of any reasonable rate of&#13;
return to capital, and (b) that the social rate of return to primary&#13;
education exceeds generally the social rate of return to higher levels of&#13;
education (Selowsky, 1979).  This permits two conclusions:&#13;
First, efficiency would be increased by spending more resources on primary&#13;
education, and second, higher education is over-extended relative to&#13;
primary education.  These conclusions are suggested by the unemployment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 316 -&#13;
found in many LDCs among graduates from higher education, the fact that&#13;
the share of education is considerably higher in LDCs than in industrialized&#13;
countries (Harbison, 1977), and by the high cost of higher education&#13;
relative to that of primary education.-   There is, thus, a convincing&#13;
case for reconsidering the balance between higher and basic education in&#13;
the interest of increased efficiency.&#13;
A related issue is the question of education finance, and in&#13;
particular  the financing of higher education. Apart from equity considerations,&#13;
it is believed that the subsidization of higher education exceeds those levels&#13;
justified by marginal externalities of higher education especially for the&#13;
wealthy and thus leads to inefficient allocation of resources, as private&#13;
education costs are set below social costs (Harbison, 1977). Demand for&#13;
higher education therefore exceeds the optimal level, and -- given the&#13;
common phenomenon of excess demand leading to excessive (i.e., inefficient)&#13;
investment patterns -- supply also tends to be over extended. The proposed&#13;
remedy is to price higher education at social cost (Harbidon, 1977).&#13;
Indeed, public secondary education is not always free in LDCs. For&#13;
instance, in Colombia, Indonesiai, and Korea, parents of secondary school&#13;
students pay school fees, graduated with income in the former two cases.-&#13;
On the other hand, there is some fear tbat charging for higher education&#13;
1/ In Bogota, for instance, secondary school costs per student exceeded&#13;
those of primary schools by 150 percent in recent years and the former&#13;
have been rising consistently more rapidly than the latter; Linn (1976c).&#13;
2/ See Linn (1976c) for Colombia; Linn et al. (1976) for Indonesia; and&#13;
Bahl and Wasylenko (1976)for Korea. In Indonesia, primary school fees&#13;
are also levied. -Since 1972 these fees are no longer paid directly&#13;
by parents to the schools attended by their children, but are paid&#13;
to the local government which distributes the funds between schools&#13;
more according to school needs than according to the neighborhoods&#13;
ability to pay.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 317&#13;
will increase the degree of its privatization, lower the quality of&#13;
public relative to private education, and thus lead to increased&#13;
inequality.-/ This issue is quite complex and far from resolved, but if&#13;
it is possible to maintain public higher education at a quality level&#13;
close to its private competitors, and if means can be found to aid low-&#13;
income individuals to attend high-schools (private or public), for&#13;
instance through student loans, scholarships, and the like, the dangers&#13;
of a regressive long term incidence of fees for higher education are&#13;
likely to be considerably reduced.&#13;
Besides attempts at restructuring the overall balance between&#13;
primary and higher education, the 1970s have seen calls for improvements&#13;
within each level of education (Harbison, 1977; World Bank, 1974a). Of&#13;
particular concern has been the fact that existing curricula and teaching&#13;
practices predominantly focus on giving the student the wherewithall&#13;
to progress from one level to the next higher level, rather than to tailor&#13;
the education programs to the needs of the majority of the students who&#13;
will leave the school system upon graduation from a particular level.&#13;
As a result, it has been suggested that skill-training be emphasized at all&#13;
levels of education, as well as functional literacy and numeracy training,&#13;
rather than general education, and a reduced reliance on external curri-&#13;
culum and examination standards imparted from excolorlial countries, such&#13;
as Britain and France.2/  The upshot has been the development of the concept&#13;
of "basic education," the essence of which is summarized in the World Bank's&#13;
1/ "A policy of direct, progressive pricing according to which the level&#13;
of subsidization decreases as income rises may be more equitable in&#13;
the short term but is likely to foster life-long income inequalities&#13;
in the future." (Hultin and Jallade, 1975, p. 25).&#13;

Education Section Working Paper:&#13;
"Basic education is an attempt, despite severe resource constraints,&#13;
to meet the needs of substantial portions of the population who&#13;
do not have access to even minimum educational opportunities.&#13;
It is a supplement, not a rival, to the formal education system,&#13;
and is intended to provide a functional, flexible and low-cost&#13;
education for those whom the formal system cannot yet reach or&#13;
ha. already passed by. Although the primary cycle may be its&#13;
principal vehicle in many countries, it differs from the conven-&#13;
tional concept of universal primary education in the three&#13;
major respects:&#13;
(i)  The objectives and content of basic education are functionally&#13;
defined in terms of "minimum learning needs" of especially&#13;
identified groups, and not as steps in the educational hierarchy&#13;
(i.e. , primary level).&#13;
(ii) The "target groups" of basic education are not necessarily&#13;
school-age children. They may vary according to age (children,&#13;
youths, adults) and socioeconomic characteristics (rural-urban&#13;
groups, women, participants in particular development programs).&#13;
(iii) The "delivery systems" of basic education will take different&#13;
forms in different countries (restructured primary schools, non-&#13;
formal programs or various combinations of the two) adapted to&#13;
the needs of different clienteles and to constraints upon resources.&#13;
The costs will play a predominant role in the choice of educational&#13;
technologies of basic education programs." (World Bank, 1974a,&#13;
p. 29/30).&#13;
One of the difficulties with the concept of "basic education"&#13;
is that in urban areas the spectrum of basic skills required by the population&#13;
is much greater than is the case in rural areas where functional education&#13;
and training can largely be tailored to help the farmer improve his&#13;
planting or livestock raising techniques, including his use of fertilizers,&#13;
of tools and machinery, and of  irrigation water.   The scope for translating&#13;
a relatively clearly defined set of skills immediately into productivity&#13;
Improvements is therefore greater in rural than in urban areas, where&#13;
complementary factors of production are not as readily available or are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 319 -&#13;
linked with a much wider range of activities (Phillips, 1978). Given&#13;
the more varied skill needs in urban areas, a greater variety is required&#13;
in education and an even greater concern with analyzing the labor demand&#13;
conditions appears to be warranted in urban areas than in rural areas,&#13;
if the urban education system is to produce the right type of skills.l/&#13;
It is therefore important to link basic education programs as far as&#13;
possible with other urban development programs, such as projects providing&#13;
shelter and urban infrastructure, small-scale enterprise and handicraft&#13;
development programs, and nutrition and health programs, which have&#13;
important training and education needs and which provide a ready context&#13;
for functionally-oriented education and training efforts.    This also&#13;
applies to more advanced training programs which are geared to provide&#13;
particular skills required for the implementation of various urban programs,&#13;
e.g., medical auxiliaries for community health posts, basic education&#13;
teachers, local government administrators, accountants, real estate&#13;
appraisers, and the like. Obviously, such an education system is&#13;
considerably more difficult to design and to implement than a system&#13;
of conventional education that has been borrowed, including textbooks,&#13;
teachers, and all, from the developed countries. And one does well&#13;
to remember  the  caveat expressed by Morawetz (1977, p. 53): "Yet&#13;
although governments have been proposing for up to 100 years that&#13;
1/ A recent World Bank project for urban development in Egypt for instance&#13;
set up training centers to"'offer courses in (i) furniture and woodwork,&#13;
(ii) leather-work, (iii) welding and metal work, and (iv) production&#13;
of handicrafts" (World Bank, 1978c, p. 21).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 320&#13;
education ought to be tailored to local needs, it seems to be difficult&#13;
in practice to implement these suggestions satisfactorily." 1/&#13;
There are further steps that can and should be taken to increase&#13;
the efficiency of the education system, including higher student-teacher&#13;
ratios where these are low and a scaling-down of training requirements&#13;
for school teachers, as it has been found that, within fairly wide&#13;
boundaries, student achievement does not appear to vary significantly&#13;
with class size and teacher training (World Bank, 1974a). Another very&#13;
important area where efficiency could be improved is a reduction of the&#13;
drop-out rate, since, as has been mentioned above, drop-outs (especially&#13;
at the primary school level) do not reach the minimum threshold of learning&#13;
required to absorb and retain the basis of literacy, numeracy and other&#13;
basic skills. Measures to reduce drop-out are best analyzed in the context&#13;
of a discussion of how the education system can be geared to meet the&#13;
needs of the urban poor, since the propensity for dropping out of school&#13;
is much higher for children from low-income groups than for those from&#13;
middle- or high-income families (World Bank, 1974a). This is therefore&#13;
a convenient point at which to turn to the design of education programs&#13;
for the urban poor.&#13;
3. Education for the Urban Poor&#13;
The improvements in urban education systems in LDCs which were&#13;
suggested above in the name of economic efficiency also can provide improved&#13;
educational opportunities for the urban poor. Changing the balance between&#13;

stressed in every major education report from 1842 until independence&#13;
in 1957" (ibid.).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 321 -&#13;
primary and higher education, reforming school financing practices, adapting&#13;
education design to emphasize functionally-oriented basic education, and&#13;
efforts to reduce drop-out and increase access to edtication would all&#13;
directly or indirectly produce benefits for the poor, as long as care&#13;
is taken in educational program and project design that the poor are&#13;
actually reached. Indeed, it is probably correct to claim that the more&#13;
effectively the public education system caters to the needs of the poor;,&#13;
the more efficient is the use of public resources devoted to education.&#13;
The following paragraphs therefore discuss the steps that may be taken&#13;
to improve the access of the urban poor to educational facilities and&#13;
the return which they can obtain from education.&#13;
The question of access to education and the net benefits which&#13;
are expected from education are very closely related, since unless there&#13;
are physical constraints on mobility or discriminatory school entrance&#13;
requirements (based, for instance, on location, race, nationality or&#13;
social status), the decision to seek or not to seek education basically&#13;
involves the comparison of costs incurred with benefits derived, subject&#13;
the family's budget constraint. The budget constraint is particularly&#13;
binding for the lowest income groups and thus an important question is&#13;
how to lower the costs of education to them.l   One important way to do this&#13;
is to locate schools in poor urban neighborhoods and thus to reduce&#13;
transportation costs from prohibitively high levels. In many LDC cities&#13;
1/ The emphasis on costs and benefits in this discussion is not to be&#13;
interpreted as limiting it to financial costs and benefits. For&#13;
instance, one important cost may be the loss of cultural identity&#13;
where education is carried out in a language other than the native&#13;
language of the student. Similarly, the possible psychic benefits&#13;
and prestige of possessing an education may be just as important as&#13;
the increased earnings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 322 -&#13;
schools are very scarce in the squatter or slum areas. In Greater Cairo,&#13;
for instance, primary school spaces are available to only 20 percent&#13;
of the school-age population in the low-income fringe areas, while&#13;
the city.wide average is 75 percent (World Bank, 1978c). In seventeen&#13;
low-income neighborhoods in Cartagena (Colombia) the number of schools&#13;
per one thousand inhabitants in 1972 was 0.33, while it was 0.44 for the&#13;
city as a whole (Linn, 1975).&#13;
However, lack of physical accessibility is not the only source&#13;
of potentially prohibitive costs for poor students and their families.&#13;
Out-of-pocket expenditures for required school uniforms, school lunches,&#13;
textbooks and materials may be considerable, not to mention the opportunity&#13;
cost of lost time which children (or adult students) could use for domestic&#13;
chores (such as infant supervision, water carrying, etc.) or jobs.&#13;
Meerman (forthcoming) has estimated that in Malaysia for one student&#13;
the out-of-pocket expenditures alone, i.e., not counting the opportunity&#13;
cost of time, amount to 13 percent of household income in the lowest&#13;
population quintile in the income distribution and 11 percent in the&#13;
next higher quintile. Thus, even where education is free as in Malaysia,&#13;
the privately incurred costs may well prevent low-income parents from&#13;
sending their children to school or may induce them to take their&#13;
children out of school before graduation. School enrollment could&#13;
therefore be increased, and the drop-out rate be reduced in many cases&#13;
by reducing out-of-pocket expenses, for instance by providing free school&#13;
lunches, books, and materials. It is important, however, to weight the&#13;
gains in increased low-income student enrollments derived from these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 323 -&#13;
policies against the gains which could have been achieved by investing&#13;
an equivalent amount of resources in building and staffing schools in&#13;
low income areas. In countries and cities where physical access to&#13;
schools and the number of available school places is already quite high&#13;
in low income areas, incentives such as those mentioned above to induce&#13;
greater enrollment and lower drop-out rates are likely to be the preferable&#13;
approach; in contrast, in countries and cities where schools are largely&#13;
absent in lo'v income neighborhoods these incentives would not significantly&#13;
help the poor, but would predominantly subsidize the better-off students,&#13;
and would inhibit the construction and staffing of schools in low-income&#13;
areas because of the overall budget constraint.&#13;
In addition to lowering private education costs to low-income&#13;
groups, the benefits which the poor derive from education can be increased&#13;
in various ways. Improved school facilities, especially reduced crowding&#13;
1/&#13;
and fewer shifts increase the quality of education.,-   Improved curri-&#13;
culum design to provide relevant skills will also raise the returns&#13;
from all types of education made available to the urban poor. However,&#13;
it is also important to note that complementary policy actions outside&#13;
the education field have important implications for the returns to&#13;
education to the poor: Improvements in the health and nutrition status&#13;
of the children have been shown to reduce absenteeism and drop-out rates and&#13;
increase the learning capacity of students while in school (World Bank, 1974a).&#13;
1/  In Jakarta, schools in low-income a.reas operated on the basis of four&#13;
two-hour shifts daily in 1976, which was seen as a major reason for&#13;
declining enrollment rates (World Bank, 1976d).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 324 -&#13;
At an even more general level, the returns to schooling for the low-income student&#13;
(and for society) depend very significantly on the overall demand for unskilled&#13;
and semi-skilled labor. Unless this demand is expanding, increased schooling&#13;
may do no more than drive down the private and social returns of education. L/&#13;
The institutional framework within which education   services&#13;
are provided for the urban poor deserves some final consideration. First,&#13;
community participation in some from -- e.g., in course selection and&#13;
curriculum design, choice of language, recruitment of teachers&#13;
is likely to be an important ingredient in ensuring that the education&#13;
provided meets the needs of the community and is regarded as a community&#13;
asset, rather than as on intrusion from outside. Second, local governments&#13;
in LDC cities frequently have extensive involvement in the provision,&#13;
operation and financing of school facilities and of complementary&#13;
services (e.g., transport) (Bahl and Linn, forthcoming). Their role&#13;
needs to be carefully studied and their capacity strengthened to provide&#13;
the type of education and complementary services outlined above. However,&#13;
the major responsibility for the education sector in most LDCs rests with&#13;
national or provincial authorities. It is at this level that issues&#13;
of basic policy such as the balance between primary and higher education,&#13;
curriculum design, education finance, teacher training, etc. must be dealt&#13;
with for urban and rural education alike. While community participation,&#13;
local government involvement, and integrated urban development projects&#13;
are virtually always essential instruments in the implementation of&#13;
education policies, particularly if they are to reach the&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 325 -&#13;
urban poor, the national (provincial) government needs to set the overa]l&#13;
priorities and provide the appropriate sector planning and resource support&#13;
to permit local urban action to work effectively.&#13;
C.  Health, Nutrition, and Family Planning /&#13;
1. Policy Issues and Approaches&#13;
Health problems in LDCs vary considerably as between continents.&#13;
countries, regions within countries, and even within cities. However,&#13;
certain fundamental similarities among all LDCs regarding health conditions&#13;
exist. These were succinctly recapitulated in the World Bank Sector Policy&#13;
Paper on Health:&#13;
"The core health problems throughout the developing world,&#13;
except among middle- and upper-income urban groups, are&#13;
fecally-transmitted diseases, air borne diseases and malnutrition.&#13;
These three elements interact cumulatively and synergistically.&#13;
This is particularly true of those below the age of five, but also&#13;
applies to the older age groups. Improved water supply and&#13;
sanitation check the fecally-related disease cycles. More&#13;
spacious, well-ventilated living conditions cut down the&#13;
transmission of air-borne and fecally-transmitted diseases.&#13;
Better nutrition reduces susceptibility to infection, and&#13;
greatly diminishes the severity as well as the duration of&#13;
illness; it is of special importance for infants and young&#13;
children." (World Bank, 1975a, p. 22).&#13;
One may compare this diagnosis of the major health problem in the typical&#13;
develo-ping country with that for the typical developed country. As shown&#13;
in Table VII-1, the predominant causes of death in the latter are the&#13;
degenerative diseases (cancer, circulatory system diseases, etc.) and&#13;
traumatic injuries, while in the former one finds infectious, parasitic and&#13;
respiratory diseases as the most important causes of death.&#13;
1/ Papers by Selowsky (1979) and Cuca (1979) deal (among other&#13;
items) with the questions of nutrition policy and family planning.&#13;
These are therefore treated only in passing in this section.&#13;

- 327 -&#13;
Since infectious diseases are far more effectively&#13;
controlled by preventing their incidence, than by treating their&#13;
symptoms (World Bank, 1975a) one would expect that LDCs are&#13;
emphasizing preventive, rather than curative measures in health care.&#13;
However, public health expenditures in LDCs are biased very heavily in&#13;
favor of curative, rather than preventive care (Table VII-2),- and&#13;
within the former category the emphasis is on in-hospital, rather than&#13;
out-patient treatment (Rao, 1974; World Bank, 1975a),&#13;
Besides this bias towards curative care, analyses of LDC&#13;
health conditions and policies usually also detect a bias in&#13;
favor of urban, as against rural areas, in the sense that&#13;
health services (as measured by the availability of hospital beds or&#13;
doctors per population) are relatively abundant in urban, as compared&#13;
with rural areas (World Bank, 1975a; Oftedal and Levinson, 1977), while&#13;
common indicators of morbidity, life-expectancy,,and nutrition show&#13;
that urban areas, on the average, are better off than rural areas&#13;
(World Bank, 1975a; Basta, 1977). However, before jumping to any conclusion&#13;
one has to bear in mind two important factors complicating the picture.&#13;
First, Basta (1977) has demonstrated very convincingly that&#13;
average indices of health and nutrition conditions in urban areas can&#13;
be extremely misleading. Indeed, the available evidence indicates that&#13;
the inhabitants of slum and squatter areas fare significantly worse in terms&#13;
of health and nutrition than is shown by city averages (see Table II-12 above)&#13;
1/ These figures do not, apparently, include outlays for sanitation&#13;
(water supply, sewerage, and solid waste disposal),which could&#13;
be counted among preventive health measures.&#13;

nutrition, there is convincing evidence that the urban poor are frequently&#13;
worse off than the rural population (Table II-il above) .- As long as&#13;
the urban poor live in over-crowded housing with no access to safe&#13;
water and disposal of human and solid waste, and only limited availability&#13;
of preventive health care they are likely to be seriously&#13;
affected by ill-health (Golladay and Koch-Weser, 1974). This problem is&#13;
compounded by the fact that the nutritional intake of the urban poor in&#13;
general tends to be lower, and less well balanced, than for the rural poor&#13;
due to the greater availability of poor nutritional substitutes (Basta, 1977).&#13;
The fact that relatively few mothers breast-feed their infants during the&#13;
crucial first year of life, and frequently dilute commercial baby formulas&#13;
with unsafe water, creates particularly serious health and nutrition&#13;
problems among urban poor (Jaycox, 1976; Reutlinger and Selowsky, 1976).&#13;
1/ The urban health problem in some LDC cities appears in fact to be&#13;
growing, as indicated by the fact that in Kingston increases in the&#13;
incidence of tuberculosis have been registered in recent years&#13;
(Jamaica Ministry of Finance and Planning, 1978); in Sao Paulo,&#13;
the infant morbidity is rising, there is a resurgence of malaria&#13;
and the bubonic plague, and menengitis in 1974 took on epidemic&#13;
proportions (Webb and Pfefferman, 1978); in Manila, the incidence&#13;
of cholera and tuberculosis appears to be on the rise (World Bank,&#13;
1976e).&#13;
2/ The relative nutrition deprivation of the urban as compared with&#13;
the rural poor has been confirmed in recent studies for India&#13;
(Katona-Apte, 1977), Peru (Thomas, 1978), and Jamaica (Jamaica&#13;
Ministry of Finance and Planning, 1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 330 -&#13;
The second factor to consider is that while curative hea.lth services&#13;
(as reflected by conventionally trained doctors, and nurses as well as hospital&#13;
beds) are indeed highly concentrated in urban areas, the access to these&#13;
facilities is frequently quite limited for the urban poor due to high&#13;
costs of medical attention and medication, lack of information, and physical&#13;
as well as cultural inaccessibility of modern curative medical care.&#13;
Moreover, the distribution of prevetitive and basic curative care of the&#13;
kind provided by community public health posts and similar neighborhood-&#13;
based institutions is, at least in some LDC9, biased in favor of rural,&#13;
rather than urban areas. In Jamaica, for example, the ratio of basic&#13;
health staff per population served is lower in the Kingston Metropolitan&#13;
Region than in the country as a whole (Jamaica Ministry of Finance and&#13;
Planning, 1978). For Malaysia, Meerman (forthcoming) concludes that&#13;
public expenditures for health favor rural areas and small towns relative&#13;
to the large cities. While a pro-rural and small-town bias in not&#13;
likely to be the rule in all LDCs -- Selowsky (forthcoming) demonstrates,&#13;
for example, that the reverse is true in Colombia -- one nevertheless&#13;
needs to be cautious in presuming that the healt:h and nutrition needs&#13;
of the urban poor are necessarily better (let alone adequately) served,&#13;
by prevailing policies, when compared with the poor in rural areas.&#13;
Whatever the precise balance between urban and rural poor in&#13;
their relative benefits received from public health policies in LDCs,&#13;
there can be little doubt that neither of these two groups have been&#13;
served well by the prevailing emphasis on urban-based modern curative&#13;
medicine. Matters are made worse by the fact that the costs of modern&#13;
medical technology are very high, both in terms of the outlays for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 331 -&#13;
medical facilities and in terms of medical training (World Bank, 1975a).l/&#13;
Also, in terms of cost-effectiveness, conventional curati.-S medical care&#13;
has been shown to be inferior to preventive methods for the health&#13;
problems that are prevalent in LDCs. For example, Rao (1974, p. 150)&#13;
cites a study for Morocco, demonstrating "that the costs of saving a life&#13;
average $2,500 in general hospitals but only $40 with mass vaccination&#13;
programs." One may therefore conclude that public health care provision&#13;
in LDCs has generally been inequitable and inefficient and that significant&#13;
changes are required to wake public health services more efficient and&#13;
equitable, not only in rural, but also in urban areas.&#13;
2. Towards a Basic Health Strategy for Urban Areas in LDCs&#13;
A comprehensive strategy for basic health for the cities of&#13;
developing countries should involve the following five components:&#13;
First, the conventional focus on high-technology curative medical&#13;
care *ith the associated emphasis on degenerative diseases should be&#13;
replaced by preventive efforts to reduce the incidence of those diseases&#13;
most prevalent in LDCs, i.e., infectious, parasitic and respiratory&#13;
diseases. This would not imply a loss of all modern curative services,&#13;
but would mean that these services would have to be provided without&#13;
subsidy and without heavy commitment of public capital. Health&#13;
1/ The cost of educating a physician in LDCs frequently ranges between&#13;
$25,000 and $80,000, and a sizeable portion of the locally trained&#13;
doctors tend to emigrate to the industrialized countries. It is&#13;
not untypical to find that medical doctors emigrating per year account&#13;
for more than 20 percent of total annual medical graduates&#13;
(World Bank, 1975a).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 332 -&#13;
insurance systems, privatization of medical education, and the like could&#13;
provide a framework for continued curative health provision. -&#13;
Second, associated with the switch from curative to preventive&#13;
health care should be a switch from in-patient treatment in large hospitals&#13;
to community-based, out-patient treatment in smaller health centers,&#13;
which also are charged with the preventive and promotional functions of&#13;
a basic health care system, including maternal and child health care,&#13;
immunization, family planning, nutrition programs, and health education.&#13;
Indeed the comprehensive approach of the health-nutrition-family planning&#13;
interactions is an essential component of a basic health system.&#13;
Third, the development of such a basic health care system would&#13;
also require changes in medical training: The conventional emphasis on&#13;
highly trained, specialized and costly medical staff should give way to&#13;
the development of a staff of community health workers, who receive a&#13;
broadly based, but quite rudimentary training in the area of health,&#13;
nutrition and family planning services.il&#13;
Fourth, a basic health care system should pay particular attention&#13;
to those population groups most directly affected by the prevalent diseases&#13;
and malnutrition, i.e., the poor in general, and among them especially&#13;
infants,and pregnant and lactating women. The basic health needs of these&#13;
groups are most severe, their ability to seek prevention and treatment from&#13;
private sources is most limited, and the external benefits from public&#13;
intervention are most significant.&#13;
-1J Oftedal and Levinson (1977) report that "in Malaysia auxiliaries&#13;
cost 75% to 85% less than a doctor per working day."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 333 -&#13;
Fifth, a basic health program should also give explicit&#13;
consideration to the sanitary needs of the urban population. It is well&#13;
established that improved water supply anu waste disposal systems are&#13;
essential ingredients to a Drogram of improving public health, particular.hb&#13;
in urban areas. At the same time, general public health programs are&#13;
required to provide the maximum benefits from investments in sanitary&#13;
infrastructure (World Bank, 1975a).&#13;
There is evidence that various LDCs have begun to shift from&#13;
the traditional focus on conventional curative health care towards&#13;
the kind of basic health system outlined in the preceding paragraphs.&#13;
For example, in 1972 Jamaica initiated a system of "primary health care"&#13;
which included all the major components of basic health care suggested&#13;
here (Jamaica Ministry of Finance and Planning, 1978). In the wake of&#13;
the observation that the health conditions in its major cities are&#13;
worsening, Brazil has begun a reevaluation of its health strategy&#13;
and initiated an increased effort of providing some elements of basic&#13;
health care to the lower income groups (Webb and Pfefferman, 1978).&#13;
Also, a number of recent urban development projects financed by the&#13;
World Bank have given a prominent role to basic health care components,&#13;
e.g. in Indonesia, the Philippines, Botswana, and Colombia.&#13;
The example of the Jamaican primary health care system is&#13;
particularly interesting, because of its comprehensive&#13;
design, and since it has been in operation for a number of years.-&#13;
The structure of this system is summarized in Figure VII-2. The&#13;

system operates out of community-based health centers in locations&#13;
easily accessible to the poor, and relies heavily on the services of&#13;
community health aids and nurse practitioners. The former, of whom&#13;
1,169 had been trained between 1972 and 1978, "are members of the&#13;
community who are trained, for 6-8 weeks to do field work (have visiting)&#13;
at primary care level, providing maternal and child care, family planning&#13;
and nutritional services."  (3amaica Ministry of Finance and Planning,&#13;
1978, p. 5.8). Nurse practitioners were recently introduced to take over&#13;
some para-medical functions traditionally executed by physicians. The&#13;
focus of the preventive and promotional programs are heavily slanted&#13;
to deal with the needs of the most vulnerable groups, i.e., pregnant and&#13;
lactating mothers, infants, and children. The results of the program were&#13;
judged to be encouraging, but still fall far short of meeting the basic health&#13;
needs of Jamaica in full, mainly because of the insufficient availability&#13;
of resources, especially in the Kingston Metropolitan Area. Also, some&#13;
difficulties were encountered in the selection of health aids from the&#13;
communities, resulting in uneven assignments across the city and a&#13;
slowdown in the training program. The work of these aides also appears&#13;
to be complicated by a continuing uncertainty regarding their role and&#13;
regarding their relationship to the conventional health staff. Jamaica,&#13;
like most of the LDCs, still has a long way to go in implementing an&#13;
effective basic health care system, but at least the direction of&#13;
change appears correct.&#13;

VIII. CONCLUSION&#13;
The urban populations of developing countries are growing at very&#13;
rapid rates. Between 1975 and the year 2000 urban communities in developing&#13;
countries will have to absorb close to one billion people. The number of&#13;
very large cities is also increasing rapidly. In 1950 only one city in&#13;
the developing countries had more than 5 million inhabitants." By the end&#13;
of this century some 40 cities are expected to be at or above this size.&#13;
Such a pace of urban growth is posing unprecedented challenges for national&#13;
and municipal policy makers.&#13;
This paper has reviewed in some detail a number of important areas&#13;
of urban policy, with a particular focus on how policy can be designed to&#13;
improve the efficiency and equity of urban growth, in particular as regards&#13;
urban employment, fiscal measures, transportation, housing, and social&#13;
services. Throughout, it has been emphasized that many turban policies can&#13;
be designed to improve both the efficiency and the equity of the development&#13;
of cities, without a conflict between these goals.&#13;
In the area of employment and labor-market policies, the paper&#13;
stressed the importance of national action for improving the balance between&#13;
the growth of labor supply and the growth of labor demand, but it also focussed&#13;
on various city-level policies which can increase employment and earnings,&#13;
esp6cially for the poorer segments of the urban population. The policies&#13;
included improvements in local administration, regulation and taxation so&#13;
as to eliminate biases against low-income employment; public service investment&#13;
and pricing measures designed to foster a greater labor intensity of service&#13;
provision and improved operations especially for small scale enterprises;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 337 -&#13;
urban land use policies to permit increased participation of&#13;
poor households in the labor market; and improved education and health&#13;
services for low-income neighborhoods.&#13;
More and better employment opportunities can raise the incomes&#13;
of the urban population, and particularly of the urban poor, only in the&#13;
long term. More immediate alleviation of urban poverty must come through&#13;
other public actions. While the fiscal system in most countries has not&#13;
been notably effective in reducing overall inequality, tax measures can bs&#142;&#13;
designed so as to reduce the burden of existing taxes on the lower-iwricorE.&#13;
groups and to shift a greater share of the burden of newly raised tax&#13;
revenues to the better off. This paper considered the potential for such&#13;
action at the urban level and found that many indirect taxes, but also&#13;
property taxes, automotive taxes and various benefit taxes commonly fouild&#13;
in LDCs can be redesigned to meet these goals. Nevertheless, the main&#13;
potential of the public sector in improving the equity and efficiency of&#13;
urban growth lies on the expenditure side of the public budget and in rn-I of&#13;
regulatory and pricing policies for urban services, particularly in cthe&#13;
areas of urban transportation, housing, and social services.&#13;
In discussing public actions for the provision, financing and&#13;
regulation of these services this paper has focussed on the need to reassess&#13;
past urban policies. These have frequently involved the bulldozing of slums,&#13;
the banning of street vendors and traditional modes of transport, and the&#13;
building of high-cost public housing, subways and limited access highways,&#13;
all of which primarily serve the interest of the wealthier residents. In&#13;
place of these approaches, the paper has argued that urban investment,&#13;
pricing and regulation policies should be designed to,assist those forms of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
338 -&#13;
transportation, housing, sanitation and other services which meet the needs&#13;
of the majority of the urban population, including the poor, at low cost.&#13;
For example, while urban transport policies have in the past served mainly&#13;
to increase the road capacity for the growing avalanche of private automobiles,&#13;
attention needs to be given instead to an expansion of bus fleets and routes,&#13;
to a more favorable environment for traditional, non-motorized modes of&#13;
transport, and to the construction of low-cost access routes for buses and&#13;
service vehicles in poor neighborhoods. In the area of housing, past policies&#13;
have too often been limited to the construction of too few and too costly&#13;
public housing schemes relative to the needs or means of the most urban&#13;
dwellers. A more appropriate housing policy would focus on eliminating&#13;
impediments to private initiative in house construction and on providinf&#13;
these elements of housing supply -- especially sites, low-cost water,&#13;
sanitation, and other services, security of tenure and construction loans --&#13;
which private initiative is least able to supply. Similar shifts in favor&#13;
of low-cost replicable delivery systems are necessary if education and health&#13;
services are to reach the majority of urban dwellers.&#13;
This paper has not attempted to place city-level policy for&#13;
more efficient and equitable urban growth into the overall context of national&#13;
spatial policy, except where this was necessary to clarify the options and&#13;
limitations for city-level policy. However, it is important to bear in mind&#13;
that national spatial development and the growth of any particular urban&#13;
area are highly interrelated aspects of one and the same transformation&#13;
process. The main implications of this interrelationship are discussed&#13;
by Renaud (1979).&#13;
Yet another aspect of urban policy was purposefully set aside as&#13;
lying largely beyond the scope of this paper, namely a discussion of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 339 -&#13;
institutional framework of urban government, administration and finances.&#13;
Urban government presents very difficult tasks under the best of circum-&#13;
stances; in the cities of developing countries the problems faced by urban&#13;
authorities are monumental, while the resources to deal with them are&#13;
exceedingly scarce. But since the public sector Y.as a pervasive role in&#13;
managing urban growth, the benefits from making urban governments more&#13;
effective are substantial. Even the best urban development strategy comes&#13;
to naught unless there are institutions to implement it. Improvements in&#13;
the institutional framework are therefore a prerequisite for more efficient&#13;
and equitable growth. This paper has addressed some institutional questions&#13;
in the context of the specific areas of urban policy that were dealt with&#13;
above; however, the range and importance of issues regarding urban&#13;
administration and finances are so significant as to warrant a separate,&#13;
comprehensive and detailed assessment of urban government.l/&#13;
1/  Such an assessment is currently under preparation (Bahl and Linn,&#13;
forthcoming).&#13;

            Policies for efficient and equitable growth
            of cities in developing countries
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The unprecedented rate of urban growth
            in developing nations has created massive new tasks for
            national and local policy makers. This paper, which was
            prepared as a background paper for World Development Report,
            1979, attempts to delineate the major policy issues which
            arise in the efforts to adapt to the growth of cities in
            developing countries, and it discusses policies designed to
            increase the efficiency and equity of urban development.
            Particular areas covered by this paper include urban
            employment, income redistribution through the fiscal system,
            transportation, housing, and social services (i.e.,
            education, health, and related services). The policy
            instruments which are considered include public investment,
            pricing, taxation, and regulation. Throughout, it is
            emphasized that many of these policy instruments can be used
            in ways that improve both the efficiency and the equity of
            the development of cities, without a conflict between these
            goals. The paper does not attempt to address in a
            comprehensive manner the issues of overall national spatial
            policy, nor those relating to the administration and
            finances of urban government, since these are extensively
            treated in other forthcoming World Bank publications.
