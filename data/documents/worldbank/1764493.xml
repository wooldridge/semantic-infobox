        <abstracts>
            In 1999 the U.S. Agency for
            International Development introduced performance-based
            contracting in an effort to improve the effectiveness of
            some of Haiti's nongovernmental organizations in
            providing basic health services, such as immunization and
            prenatal and maternal care. These providers has been
            operating under a payment system that reimbursed their
            expenses up to a ceiling. The new systems set performance
            targets and withheld a portion of their historical budget,
            allowing them to earn back the withheld payment plus a bonus
            if they met the targets. A one-year pilot involving three
            providers showed some marked improvements in performance.
