The Economic Development Institute (EDI) was established by the World Bank in 1955 to&#13;
train officials concerned with development planning, policymaking, investment analysis, and&#13;
project implementation in member developing countries. At present the substance of EDI's&#13;
work emphasizes macroeconomic and sectoral economic policy analysis. Through a variety&#13;
of courses, seminars, and workshops, most of which are given overseas in cooperation with&#13;
local institutions, EDI seeks to sharpen analytical skills used in policy analysis and to&#13;
broaden understanding of the experience of individual countries with economic development.&#13;
Although EDI's publications are designed to support its training activities, many are of&#13;
interest to a much broader audience.&#13;

The Economic Development Institute's program in banking and finance focuses on training in&#13;
prudent methods of bank management, controlling risk, ensuring banks' financial viability and&#13;
performance, and bank regulation and supervision. The main objective of this program is to&#13;
support the reform and development of banking and financial systems and the training of middle-&#13;
and higher-level banking executives and other members of the financial community in the general&#13;
principles of bank management, using our trainers' network. The approach for meeting these&#13;
objectives consists of training local groups of trainers in banking system issues and the financial&#13;
management of banks; mobilizing graduates of the trainers' program in teams that deliver short-&#13;
term programs for bankers and other financial practitioners; creating a set of materials in print and&#13;
video form, relying heavily on local partner institutions for production and translation assistance;&#13;
and building sustainable capacity in our partner institutions.&#13;
Significant results have been achieved in these areas, since program commencement in 1992 for&#13;
the republics of the former Soviet Union. Graduates of the EDI training programs have developed&#13;
and delivered courses for bankers, practitioners, and undergraduate students in various educational&#13;
institutions, both as trainers and EDI-sponsored programs, as well as separately. Training teams&#13;
are operating under EDI sponsorship in Russia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine. In addition,&#13;
many of the trainers have gone on to hold key positions in central banks, ministries of finance, and&#13;
major financial institutions in various republics, and to serve as consultants to the government on&#13;
banking reform as well as to banks on structural, credit, and training issues. They have also been&#13;
among the first in various republics to publish new texts in banking and finance.&#13;
This handbook on Basic Topics in Sound Bank Management is one of a series of training materials&#13;
in banking and finance developed for the training of trainers and bankers in the former Soviet&#13;
Union. This manual explores major aspects of managing a banking institution. The focus is on&#13;
U.S. banks, with attention paid to international banks as well. This handbook was prepared by&#13;
Edward A. McNally of Grammer and Co., while on assignment with the Economic Development&#13;
Institute (EDI) of The World Bank and was prepared for publication by Johanna Frontczak. The&#13;
views expressed herein are entirely those of the author and to not necessarily reflect the views of&#13;

Market-based Banking: An Overview&#13;
I. Introduction&#13;
Sound bank management involves all aspects of managing a banking institution. This&#13;
manual will discuss these aspects in detail. The focus will be on US. banks. Issues which&#13;
involve international banks will be noted as appropriate. The introduction will describe&#13;
fundamental aspects of managing a bank. Key influences such as government regulation&#13;
will be introduced&#13;
Organization Structure&#13;
Well managed banks have a well-defined organization structure. The accompanying chart&#13;
shows the organization chart for a typical bank.&#13;
The board of directors consists primarily of individuals who are not employees of the bank.&#13;
The board is structured this way in order to emphasize the views of a diverse group of non-&#13;
employees. Usually there are one or two bank employees on the board. The chief executive&#13;
officer generally is the key bank employee board member.&#13;
Decision-making authority resides with individuals and committees. Authorities and&#13;
responsibilities for individual executive managers are generally approved and delegated by&#13;
the board of directors. Committees include an executive committee, loan approval&#13;
committees, asset and liability management committees, credit policy committees, audit&#13;
committees, and compensation committees. In some cases outside directors sit on these&#13;
committees.&#13;
Control Mechanisms&#13;
Control mechanisms that are effective start with written policies and procedures which are&#13;
available to and understood by all staff members. Financial control and accounting systems&#13;
along with management information systems provide excellent controls. Both intemal&#13;
auditors and external auditing firms are an essential part of the control process.&#13;
Government regulators and their examinations are part of all banks' controls but&#13;
necessarily follow banks' internal controls.&#13;

Reporting Procedures and Requirements&#13;
Reports are required for many external sources including government regulators,&#13;
shareholders, and boards of directors. Reports on bank activities are provided to rating&#13;
agencies, firms which analyze banks, and the media. Internally generated reports include&#13;
position statements, balance sheets and profit and loss statements for individual bank units,&#13;
summaries of trading activities, risk positions, and securities portfolios.&#13;
Bank Regulators&#13;
There is a major trade-off between regulation and providing a safety net for banks. Where&#13;
deposit insurance exists, banking regulators provide through their policies and&#13;
examinations, a level of safety for depositors and shareholders. Central banks often provide&#13;
loans to banks for many purposes.&#13;
Central Banks&#13;
In addition to their functions of issuing currency and influencing interest rates to balance&#13;
inflation and economic growth, Central banks provide short-term loans to banks for&#13;
temporary liquidity purposes, raise or lower bank reserve requirements for money supply&#13;
regulation, and--in cases of serious problems--arrange mergers with other banks or longer-&#13;
term, preferred-rate loans.&#13;
Risk Management&#13;
There is no single more important part of sound bank management than the methods which&#13;
a bank uses to manage risk. Banking is a risk business. Risk comes in many forms. This&#13;
manual will discuss three major risks of banking in detail:&#13;
1. Credit Risk: the danger that borrowers will not be able to repay their loans as&#13;
promised. Risks in the loan portfolio include industry risk, country risk, foreign-&#13;
exchange risk, economic risk, and environmental risk.&#13;
2. Interest Rate Risk: striking a balance between the cost of funds and the yields on&#13;
earning assets. Banks continue to use hedging techniques to mitigate this risk.&#13;
3. Liquidity Risk: the inability to meet obligations to depositors. This risk results&#13;
from one or both of the first two (a run on the bank).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                                                  Aarket Based Banking: Anh Overvic&#13;
Other risks which banks face are:&#13;
* Operations: risks in the processing side of the business such as daylight overdrafts&#13;
(payments made before funds received) can occur quickly and for large sums.&#13;
*  Technology: an inadequate selection in computer systems can lead to mistakes in&#13;
accounting and inability to adapt quickly to changing market conditions.&#13;
*  Leverage: (capital structure) too little capital or the inability to raise capital can&#13;
prevent banks from carrying out strategic initiatives.&#13;
*  Derivatives: the recent developments at Bankers Trust and at Barings are excellent&#13;
examples of the risks involved in the increasingly complex and sophisticated&#13;
derivatives markets of the 1 990s.&#13;
* Fraud and Defalcation: easy to understand but sometimes hard to control.&#13;
II. Market Based Banking: An Overview&#13;
1. Profound Changes are Occurring in Market-Based Banking.&#13;
A. There is Increased Emphasis on Interest-Sensitive Money for Funding Banks.&#13;
As evidence:&#13;
*  Historically banks relied on demand deposits (checking accounts), stable&#13;
savings deposits (interest rates were restricted by law), and equity capital. These&#13;
are called Core Deposits. In these times, banks were under-leveraged and over-&#13;
capitalized.&#13;
*  In 1961 CITIBANK introduced the negotiable certificate of deposit (CD) as a&#13;
fund-raising instrument.&#13;
*  Since then, the proportion of interest-sensitive funds has risen, interest rates&#13;
have become volatile, and interest expense has become the largest cost of&#13;
banks' profit and loss statements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Basic Topics in Sound BankkAlanagemeni                                          -&#13;
Causes include:&#13;
*  The growth of core deposits, which was not adequate to fund growth of assets.&#13;
*  The high level and volatility of interest rates in the 1970s and 1980s, which&#13;
caused depositors to avoid rate-regulated financial instruments.&#13;
*  High rates of inflation, which moved savers to look for higher interest rates than&#13;
regulated banks could offer.&#13;
Results:&#13;
*  Banks' assets increasingly financed by short-term, interest-sensitive market-rate&#13;
funds. Money was quick to move to the highest rates and safety of principal.&#13;
The market became more impersonal. "Hot" money is the term for this rapidly&#13;
moving source of funds. Approved lists of banks based on ratings developed by&#13;
rating agencies came into being and money often moved out of institutions&#13;
whose ratings were removed from the approved list. Examples of institutions&#13;
which were affected negatively include: Continental Illinois of Chicago, First&#13;
Pennsylvania, and Bank of New England.&#13;
*  Interest rate risk. As deposits become increasingly tied to the money market,&#13;
the cost and volatility of a bank's funding tends to increase relative to available&#13;
asset yields, and the margin of error shrinks. Off-balance sheet activities such as&#13;
futures, options, derivatives, and foreign exchange activities represent potential&#13;
exposure to, and protection from, interest rate risk.&#13;
B. Rapidly Escalating Loan Losses Affected Nearly All Banks.&#13;
As evidence:&#13;
* Loans to borrowers in industries such as agriculture, energy, and real estate&#13;
were the most notable write-offs.&#13;
*  Credits to lesser developed countries (called LDC loans) resulted in huge write&#13;
downs and restructuring of the loans.&#13;
*  Loan loss reserves were totally inadequate to cover the losses occurring at the&#13;
banks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6                                                 Afarker Based Banking: An Overview&#13;
Causes include:&#13;
* Severe commodity price deflation occurred in oil and in real estate.&#13;
* Widespread competition among bankers for business as termns (such as length of&#13;
loan and adequacy of collateral) for borrowers were too good.&#13;
* The development of portfolio concentrations, especially in real estate and&#13;
LDCs.&#13;
* Banks' enhanced ability to attract lendable funds (albeit highly volatile funds).&#13;
C. Erosion of Capital Strength was a Continuing Factor&#13;
As evidence:&#13;
- The growth of assets greatly exceeded the growth of capital. Before 1960, bank&#13;
capital (meaning common stock) generally was greater than 10 percent of total&#13;
assets. By the late 1980s, this key number (ratio) ranged between 5 and 8&#13;
percent. One of the causes, of course, was inflation.&#13;
* The Federal Reserve Bank has accepted the Basel accords which require higher&#13;
levels of capital (or capital adequacy) for banks worldwide. This will be&#13;
covered in greater depth later in the manual.&#13;
3 Conflict arose between regulatory and business concerns If banks were&#13;
managed to suit the risk preferences of regulators, they would be adequately&#13;
capitalized BUT probably could not attract investor capital. Conversely, if the&#13;
regulators relaxed capital standards, some bank managers could not handle the&#13;
opportunity to be entrepreneurs.&#13;
D. The Growth Of Overhead Expenses.&#13;
As evidence:&#13;
* New headquarter buildings, extensive branch networks, new products, computer&#13;
systems, and staff compensation and benefits.&#13;
* The costs of complying with regulators' demands and increases in FDIC&#13;
insurance to rebuild the fund which covers loan losses.&#13;
* Inflation and its attendant effect on all costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Basic Topics in Sousnd Bank lanagemew&#13;
There was a three-sided impact on the income stream:&#13;
1. Capital adequacy costs prevented adding income through asset growth.&#13;
2. Deregulation of deposit interest rates.&#13;
3. Competition for assets, including deposits.&#13;
Results of this growth in expenses caused the industry to focus heavily on management&#13;
of efficiency ratios (discussed in detail later in the manual). A dramatic campaign&#13;
began to reduce costs and improve efficiency ratios.&#13;
E. Intensifying Competition: Competition For Banks Increased Dramatically In The&#13;
1980s And 1990s.&#13;
As evidence:&#13;
* There are many more competitors in the marketplace, most notably such non-&#13;
banking companies as Merrill Lynch, Fidelity Investments, Household Finance,&#13;
and the General Electric Capital Corporation.&#13;
* Foreign banks, including major European institutions and the Japanese banks&#13;
entered the U.S. market aggressively.&#13;
a More choices exist for consumers with ease of access to credit cards, automatic&#13;
teller machines, banking by phone, and banking by personal computer.&#13;
* Large companies and institutions have options other than deposits and loans&#13;
such as: commercial paper, Eurobonds, interest rate and currency swaps,&#13;
futures, and derivatives.&#13;
F. Expansion Of Bank Holding Companies.&#13;
Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 permitted many new activities.&#13;
As evidence:&#13;
Under this act, banks are allowed to own businesses distinct from traditional&#13;
banking such as mortgage companies, leasing companies, investment advisory&#13;
companies, and finance companies. These new businesses operate across state&#13;
lines and are exempt from regulatory examination. The operations of these&#13;
subsidiaries can be financed with commercial paper and long-term debt. Other&#13;
banks wvere purchased by holding companies, particularly after some states&#13;
passed legislation allowing out-of-state holding companies to purchase banks in&#13;
their states.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Problem of Bank Holding Companies:&#13;
*  Often the largest assets of the holding company are the banks it owns. However,&#13;
the banks are so tightly regulated that the holding company has no access to&#13;
these assets and must, therefore, depend on dividends only as a source of cash&#13;
flow. Consequently, cash flow problems can develop for the holding company&#13;
and special attention should be paid to analyzing them.&#13;
2. Regulation (Both Government and Private) has had a Profound Effect on the&#13;
Operations and Profitability of American Banks in the Following Ways:&#13;
A. The Private Marketplace has Taken on a Much Stronger Role as Co-Regulator or&#13;
Additional Regulator, Along with Traditional Government Regulation.&#13;
*  Investment bankers persuaded the banks that ratings from independent private&#13;
agencies were necessary for banks and bank holding companies to sell&#13;
commercial paper and long-term debt (often in the form of securities).&#13;
*  Moody's, Standard and Poor's, Duff &amp; Phelps, and Fitch Investors Services&#13;
developed analytic tools for evaluating the credit of bank holding companies.&#13;
*  The agencies analyze the holding company itself and the key operating&#13;
subsidiaries.&#13;
*  Many other organizations such as banks, corporations, and non-U.S.&#13;
governmental units do their own assessments of banks and bank-holding&#13;
companies adding a further example of co-regulation.&#13;
*  Insurance in the form of protection for directors and officers or protection&#13;
against fraud is an additional level of co-regulation. Insurance costs have sky-&#13;
rocketed in recent years.&#13;
Result: All of the above processes added positive levels of market discipline to the&#13;
banks.&#13;
B. There Was a Series of Changes in U.S. Government Regulatory Emphasis&#13;
Including:&#13;
* De-regulation. Two examples are elimination of interest rate ceilings on&#13;
deposits and elimination of state prohibitions on acquisitions by out-of-state&#13;
banks.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Basic Topics in Sound Bank Alfanagement                                    9&#13;
*  Non-regulation. Regulators allowed the creation by banks of new unregulated&#13;
products, especially in capital markets (such as derivative instruments). These&#13;
products let banks compete with securities firms.&#13;
*  Re-regulation. Regulators seek to respond to banks which exhibit problems by&#13;
issuing enforcement orders, which require bank directors to correct deficiencies&#13;
in capital, liquidity, reserves, and management. One example of an Enforcement&#13;
Order is a memo of understanding (MoU), where a bank agrees to correct&#13;
certain problems after negotiation with regulators. Another example is a cease&#13;
and desist order, in which regulators require changes by institutions which have&#13;
severe problems.&#13;
C. Computer Surveillance&#13;
*  Executed by regulators, especially the Controller of the Currency and the&#13;
Federal Reserve Bank. Computer-based models substitute for regulators' ability&#13;
to directly examine all banks.&#13;
*  Performed effectively by private companies, such as the rating agencies and&#13;
consulting firms, such as Sheshinoff.&#13;
D. Standardization of Examinations&#13;
* A uniform rating system agreed to by all regulatory agencies was put into place&#13;
in 1977. It is called the CAMEL Rating system for banks and the BOPEC&#13;
Rating system for bank holding companies.&#13;
* The CAMEL Rating system will be discussed in depth in Chapter 10.&#13;

FUNDING ACTIVITIES&#13;
The funding activities of banks are defined as raising money as part of day-to-day&#13;
operations. The funds raised are the inventory which a bank purchases. This inventory is&#13;
then turned into loans, investments, trading activities, and the earning assets of the&#13;
organization.&#13;
Sound bank management is involved with funding activities such as structuring products&#13;
which are salable in the market place, determining interest rates and maturities to offer,&#13;
managing a portfolio of funds purchased (often called liability management), and&#13;
managing the bank's liquidity position. In discussing funding activities, the manual will&#13;
break down funding into deposit collection and borrowings in the financial markets. Bank&#13;
and client relationships will be discussed to emphasize the differences between corporate&#13;
and consumer customers.&#13;
I. DEPOSIT COLLECTION&#13;
Most of these instruments are insured up to $100,000 by the Federal Deposit Insurance&#13;
Corporation (FDIC). In return for providing this insurance, U.S. government regulators&#13;
such as the FDIC exercise many levels of control over the banking system. Examples are:&#13;
formal examinations of banks, issuance of charters, and development of regulations&#13;
governing the banking system. Of equal importance is that banks must maintain reserves&#13;
(in the form of accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank against many of these types of&#13;
deposits).&#13;
Types of deposits and deposit instruments include:&#13;
*  Checking Accounts: (demand deposits - payable to a depositor on demand by&#13;
writing a check) and savings accounts (time deposits - interest is paid to a depositor&#13;
if money is left in the bank for a period of time).&#13;
*  Money Market Accounts: (interest paid to depositors based on rates in the&#13;
financial or money markets; originally created to compete with mutual fund&#13;
accounts of this kind) and NOW accounts (a type of interest bearing checking&#13;
account).&#13;
11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12                                                               FundAin A cuvities&#13;
*  Certificates of Deposit and Time Deposits: funds deposited for specific periods&#13;
of time (e.g. 90 days, one year, two years) in return for which the bank agrees to&#13;
pay interest, usually at a specific rate.&#13;
*  Overseas Deposits:  from  a variety of foreign sources such as individuals,&#13;
corporations, governments, and financial institutions.&#13;
Interest Rate Structure:&#13;
Depending on the type of account, interest payments are made in a variety of ways&#13;
including:  monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually, or at the maturity of the&#13;
instrument.&#13;
Interest is calculated in many ways, including compounded. In assessing a bank's deposit&#13;
mix, it is important to know the methods of interest calculations for the various types of&#13;
accounts.&#13;
Maturity Structure:&#13;
The management of maturities in terms of amounts and timing is discussed in detail in the&#13;
asset and liability sections of this manual.&#13;
Maturities are related directly to the liquidity of the bank, an important factor in good&#13;
management.&#13;
Household and Individual Accounts&#13;
Historically, bank branch offices have been large generators of consumer and small- and&#13;
medium-size business and other types of organizations' deposits. Telephone banking,&#13;
automated teller machines, bank by mail, and direct payroll and social security deposits are&#13;
additional ways to accumulate household funds.&#13;
Corporate Accounts&#13;
While branch offices often play a role here, both account officers and product specialists,&#13;
who solicit this business from corporations, are deeply involved in this type of deposit&#13;
raising.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Basic Topics in7 Sound Ban7k Alanagenment                                 13&#13;
Government Accounts and Non Profit Institutions&#13;
As with corporate accounts, branch offices play a role, and account officers and product&#13;
specialists are involved.&#13;
Correspondent Banks&#13;
Deposits can be raised from other banks (often called correspondents). The bank that holds&#13;
the funds for the depositing bank often provides services such as check clearing, letters of&#13;
credit, and many other activities.&#13;
II. BORROWING IN FINANCIAL MARKETS&#13;
Types of borrowings:&#13;
- Federal funds: overnight borrowings from other banks in order to meet liquidity&#13;
or Federal Reserve Requirements.&#13;
-  Commercial paper: short term (30, 60, 90 days) notes at fixed rates of interest to&#13;
corporations and other organizations.&#13;
*  Repurchase Agreements: securities (usually U.S. government instruments) sold&#13;
by the bank to investors under agreements to repurchase. They are short-term,&#13;
generally overnight or over the weekend.&#13;
*  Borrowing from the Federal Reserve Bank: generally done only when severe&#13;
liquidity problems develop. The Federal Reserve is known as the "lender of last&#13;
resort." Its terms and conditions for making loans to members most often are aimed&#13;
at encouraging or requiring significant changes in the bank.&#13;
*  Other types of longer term securities (often five years or more): these are issued&#13;
by banks, including subordinated notes (priority for repayment is junior to virtually&#13;
all other forms of debt), capital notes, and unsecured debentures. The interest rates&#13;
paid on these types of securities are much higher than shorter term instruments, due&#13;
to the risks associated with their longer maturity.&#13;
Borrowing strategies and market considerations:&#13;
* Banking is a confidence game: Those who fund the banks (whether consumers or&#13;
sophisticated investors) must have confidence in the institution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14                                                             Funding .4cz c'iiics&#13;
*  In the domestic market, confidence can be in the form of knowledge and familiarity&#13;
of the bank, research from rating agencies, and evaluations from other firms which&#13;
assess banks. For example, many corporations and investors have restrictions on&#13;
purchasing funds from banks which are below investment grade.&#13;
*  In the overseas market, the ratings and reputations of the banks take on even greater&#13;
significance due to lack of familiarity with the large number of U.S. banks.&#13;
*  A key strategy in funding activities is to diversify sources and maturities of funding&#13;
instruments. The manual will examine this in greater depth in the asset liability&#13;
management section. In this sense, banking can be regarded as a cashflow business&#13;
in that the management of its own cash flow is a critical aspect of sound banking&#13;
practices.&#13;
III. BANK AND CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS&#13;
The differences in ways that banks raise funds from its clients demonstrate the truly&#13;
different constituencies banks serve. Soundly managed institutions develop business plans&#13;
which recognize the differences.&#13;
*  Marketing Consumers. Advertising, promotions, community service, and tactics&#13;
such as asking prominent community members to join boards of directors are some&#13;
of the ways that banks raise their level of recognition in communities. These&#13;
activities are aimed at developing the confidence level consumers want in order to&#13;
deposit funds in the bank and to use other bank services.&#13;
* Marketing Corporations. The techniques used to raise funds from businesses are&#13;
centered around the use of specialists to call on businesses for the purpose of&#13;
selling bank services. Providing various forms of credit is an important tactic in&#13;
raising corporate deposits, especially from mid-size and small companies. A trade-&#13;
off develops in which a bank makes a loan in order to obtain a company's deposits.&#13;
For large corporations, banks provide an array of cash management products in&#13;
order to obtain deposits.&#13;
&#13;

LENDING ACTIVITIES: AN OVERVIEW&#13;
In viewing the soundness of a bank, the commercial loan portfolio should be examinedfirst&#13;
because it is often the area of greatest risk for most banks. The bank's loan policies and&#13;
procedures as well as its adherence to them, are a key to the institution's soundness.&#13;
Following the Introduction is a credit arocess chart which describes the steps of the entire&#13;
credit planning, marketing, approval, monitoring, and collecting cycle. Each of the steps of&#13;
the cycle will be briefly described in the narrative. Consumer loans will be discussed&#13;
beginning in part VIII of this section of the manuaL&#13;
i. INTRODUCTION&#13;
Managing a sound commercial loan policy begins with a good business plan. The&#13;
marketing and credit functions should work together to develop a basic business approach.&#13;
For example, the strategy could be to focus on small and medium-sized businesses, as well&#13;
as consumer loans in the bank's market. Target market segments are developed and basic&#13;
underwriting standards of acceptable credits established. This approach is written down&#13;
and communicated to all sectors of the bank. An advertising and promotion program can be&#13;
created and specific plans aimed at markets and potential customers. The ability to resolve&#13;
the dilemma between making quality loans in order to meet budget targets, and avoiding&#13;
credit losses, starts with the creation of a business plan by the marketing and credit areas.&#13;
Loan Portfolio Management&#13;
Sound banking practices involve prudent management of the loan portfolio. Banks are&#13;
increasingly using technology to assist is this process. In many ways, portfolio&#13;
management of loans can be compared to managing an investment portfolio.&#13;
Some portfolio management methods include:&#13;
* Using a legal lending limit (10 percent of capital and surplus in the U.S.) to any&#13;
single borrower or closely-related names to limit risk concentration.&#13;
* Using a house limit (often half the legal limit or less) to control more tightly&#13;
lending to a single borrower.&#13;

Segmenting general banking business into lines of business by industry (such as&#13;
real estate or agriculture) to focus expertise against risk AND against marketing&#13;
opportunities.&#13;
*  Appointing (within industry lines) a world-wide parent account officer to control&#13;
exposure AND manage marketing to multinational and large customers.&#13;
*  Creating a central register to monitor outstandings under approved lines of credit&#13;
AND credit commitments.&#13;
*  Sub-categorizing risks by geography (countries and regions), collateral, type of loan&#13;
such as tern loans, letters of credit, indirect obligations, guarantors, and affiliates.&#13;
*  Monitoring loan and risk MATURITIES, especially in relation to the bank's&#13;
liquidity and deposit mix.&#13;
D Extending the central register to include treasury products, overnight and daylight&#13;
limits (usually to banks and brokers), derivative products, and investment banking&#13;
situations. These are tougher than loans to monitor on a timely basis.&#13;
-  Tracking obligations by fixed rate of interest or floating rate interest to aid&#13;
allocation of scarce resources to fixed rate.&#13;
*  Using detailed analytical methods to evaluate and forecast loss probabilities by&#13;
economic trends, industry, and other criteria.&#13;
II. CREDIT ANALYSIS&#13;
*  Transaction Summary (credit application). Describes the purpose of the loan, the&#13;
type of business being financed, the history of the business, the management's&#13;
background, and includes checking with other sources of credit such as suppliers.&#13;
*  Analysis of Financial Statements. Calculation and analysis of ratios, cash flow,&#13;
balance sheets, profit and loss statements, notes to financial statements, financial&#13;
projections, and other appropriate items are done in this phase. Spread sheets are&#13;
created with as much uniformity as possible throughout the bank. Much of these&#13;
calculations can be automated using software programs such as "Turbo Fast." The&#13;
comparison of results from period-to-period are included here with detailed&#13;
explanations of significant changes and emphasis on trends.&#13;

* Loan Structure. The term and maturity of the facility, the repayment terns, the&#13;
type of loan (line of credit, revolving credit, demand loan, letter of credit, term&#13;
loan) are covered in depth.&#13;
* Risk Analysis. All risks in the transaction and the mitigants to them should be&#13;
analyzed. Risks include:&#13;
1. Economic factors such as the effect of inflation;&#13;
2. Factors peculiar to specific industries, such as fashion in the clothing&#13;
business;&#13;
3. Potential hazards with the structure of the loan such as a loan to a holding&#13;
company;&#13;
4. Country risk in the case of credits to sovereign governments and&#13;
organizations located in those countries;&#13;
5. Payment risk, such as too much debt in the borrower's business or inability&#13;
to meet sales forecast;&#13;
6. Collateral risk, meaning that collateral might be insufficient to pay the loan;&#13;
7. Foreign exchange risk if there is exposure to foreign currencies involved;&#13;
8. Interest rate risk in the sense that if there are major shifts in rates, how will&#13;
the borrower be affected?&#13;
9. Product risk, for example where in the life cycle is the product being&#13;
financed?&#13;
10. Management risk, e.g. experience, depth, and integrity.&#13;
The types of risks are unlimited. The critical factor is to describe and understand them.&#13;
Most important is to detail the mitigants to the risks.&#13;
* Collateral. Collateral such as property or accounts receivable should be analyzed&#13;
and inspected. Independent views of the value of the collateral are essential. For&#13;
example, third party appraisals of equipment or real estate are essential.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
201                                                    Lending Activities: A-n Overvicew&#13;
Collateral should have three characteristics:&#13;
1) It should be worth as much or more as the loan advanced;&#13;
2) It should be easy to take possession and then to sell;&#13;
3) It must be clearly identifiable as the lender's asset.&#13;
*  Guarantees. Detailed assessments of guarantors' capacity to repay the loan are&#13;
essential. Analysis of guarantors' financial statements, capacity to repay, character,&#13;
management, and the like are best accomplished before the loan is made.&#13;
*  Loan Agreements and Covenants. Many loans require the preparation of loan&#13;
agreements, which are legal documents describing the specific obligations of the&#13;
borrower and the lender. The documents are prepared by bank counsel on a custom&#13;
basis for a specific transaction. In addition, the bank can have standard counsel&#13;
prepare documents for less complicated loans. If covenants are part of the&#13;
agreement, they should be realistic. For example, financial tests such as ratios&#13;
should be linked to the borrower's historic results and projections.&#13;
III. APPROVALS&#13;
Banks use three types of approval methods:&#13;
1. Loan Committees&#13;
Usually consist of both credit approval and line staff. Dollar levels of authority are&#13;
pegged to the size of the loans which the bank is allowed to make and the experience&#13;
level of the committee members. Senior executives, including the Chief Executive&#13;
Officer, should be on the committee that looks at the largest loans made by the bank.&#13;
Chief Financial Officers may be -included to take into account funding requirements&#13;
and pricing.&#13;
2. Signature Approvals&#13;
A chain of approval levels is established. Bank officers will have approval authorities&#13;
based on their credit skills (such as real estate). The authorities are usually designated&#13;
by the Board of Directors.&#13;
3. Credit Scoring&#13;
An experience-based numerical method evaluating key risks of credit cards, consumer&#13;
loans, and home mortgage loans. Criteria such as years with the same employer,&#13;
telephone, zip code address are important.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Basic Topics in Sound Bank Mlanagement                                     21&#13;
IV. POLICY&#13;
Bank loan policies such as advance rates against various types of collateral should be&#13;
written in a manual and should be updated regularly. A credit policy officer often&#13;
supported by a staff of credit specialists should handle this function with input from&#13;
executive management and from line management. The manual should have a section&#13;
covering loan documentation and procedures for dealing with problem credits.&#13;
Disbursement procedures, authorities, and requirements can be included in the policy&#13;
manual.&#13;
Exceptions to policy should be written and clearly explained (bad loans frequently arise&#13;
from exceptions to loan policy.)&#13;
* Loan rating system. A numerical rating system (for example, one for the best&#13;
credits through five for the worst) is a requirement for American banks. The rating&#13;
system can be helpful in assessing trends, developing strategy, and working with&#13;
regulators.&#13;
- Pricing. Policies must be written and understood by all staff involved. Matrixes&#13;
can be created which relate pricing to risk, credit rating, collateral, and other&#13;
factors. Exceptions should be noted in writing. A balance of credit, line, and&#13;
financial management, and strategic objectives is an appropriate goal for pricing.&#13;
3 Credit file. The bank's credit policy will require that a file be maintained for each&#13;
borrower. The file is standardized throughout the bank with specific definitions of&#13;
what it must contain. For example, credit applications and analyses, spread sheets,&#13;
memos describing customer contact, and correspondence, are maintained in the file.&#13;
V. OTHER CREDIT FUNCTIONS&#13;
*  Loan Review Department (also known as credit audit). The function of this group&#13;
is to examine loans after they are made and provide an independent assessment.&#13;
This may be done on an on-going basis to follow the progress of a credit. An&#13;
important role of this department is to assess portfolios and departments. It can&#13;
provide management with important information about trends and weaknesses in&#13;
the portfolio. It is another important part of sound bank management. Regulators&#13;
have required the strengthening of this area in response to the surge of loan defaults&#13;
in the late 1980s and 1990s. In smaller banks, auditors or outside consultants may&#13;
perform this function.&#13;
.  Credit Department.  This department maintains credit files, performs credit&#13;
analysis, writes up loan proposals, and often serves as a training ground for future&#13;
loan officers. Another of its functions is to monitor loans and loan portfolios to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

alert officers to potential problems by analyzing periodic reports provided by&#13;
borrowers. Alerting loan officers to missing or expired documents, expiring loans,&#13;
or issues involving collateral, is a function that often is undertaken by this&#13;
department. Its members generally are graduates of, or participants in, the bank's&#13;
training program for loan officers.&#13;
VI. PROBLEM LOANS (workouts)&#13;
In determining a bank's soundness, a review of its approach to managing problem loans is&#13;
essential. Bank policy in this area generally is written. Committees to manage the problem&#13;
loan portfolio are created. The committees consist of problem loan specialists, credit policy&#13;
staff, members of the bank's accounting staff, and loan review staff. Regularly scheduled&#13;
meetings (including meetings with executive management and the Board of directors) are&#13;
held to review problem credits and portfolios. In these meetings credit ratings are changed,&#13;
classifications assigned, and recommendations are made for actions relating to the&#13;
establishment of reserves or losses. The creation of trend reports and action plans are&#13;
critical for sound bank management.&#13;
Separate Problem Loans Departments&#13;
These departments are staffed by loan work out specialists and are found in many banks.&#13;
Classifications&#13;
The banking regulators define problem loans in four categories:  (Most banks have&#13;
adopted this system.)&#13;
1. Especially Mentioned. Loans which have demonstrated weaknesses or potential&#13;
for problems, such as collateral which has decreased in value, or operating losses.&#13;
2. Substandard.  The possibility of a loss to the bank exists and substantial&#13;
deterioration of the borrower's ability to repay has taken place.&#13;
3. Doubtful. The likelihood of a loss is great. Liquidation of collateral will not repay&#13;
the loan.&#13;
4. Loss - No likelihood of recovery.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Basic Topics in Sonid Bank Alanagement                                         '3&#13;
Problem Loan Management&#13;
A good rule of thumb is that any loan with payments more than 90 days past due should be&#13;
classified, interest accrual discontinued, and prior accrued interest reversed from earnings.&#13;
There are many ways to work with borrowers who are experiencing difficulty meeting loan&#13;
terms:&#13;
*  The bank should require a formal written business plan with assumptions and&#13;
containing revised financial projections and budgets.&#13;
*  Often the lender will ask for additional collateral, guaranties, or injection of capital.&#13;
These actions may help the bank to improve its position with a borrower whose&#13;
condition has deteriorated.&#13;
*  An option exists to re-structure the loan, including maturity, size of payments,&#13;
terms and conditions, advance rates, and the like.&#13;
*  In most cases the bank will negotiate for a higher interest rate to reflect the&#13;
increased risk in a deteriorated credit.&#13;
*  Legal issues are extremely relevant in problem loan management. Even the most&#13;
experienced bank work-out staff consult frequently with counsel to review bank&#13;
positions and actions.&#13;
In both a bank's own analysis of problem loans and the regulatory authorities' formal&#13;
examinations, there is much latitude in assigning classifications. Financial information&#13;
must be analyzed, business plans studied, and other factors such as additional collateral&#13;
assessed. Most delinquent loans are assigned a classification and loans which are current&#13;
can receive a classification.&#13;
OREO - This category of assets which consists of "other real estate owned" frequently&#13;
appears on bank balance sheets. This was a major issue for banks after the large number of&#13;
real estate related loan defaults in the late 1980s and early 1 990s. It consists of real estate&#13;
repossessed (and actually owned by the bank) after a loan defaults. The management of&#13;
this portfolio requires specialists in real estate.&#13;

VII. THOUGHTS ON LENDING&#13;
* Good process equals good portfolio.&#13;
*  Make sure today's seemingly good risks are not written off tomorrow.&#13;
*  Bank lending horizons are long term (even though the borrower's horizons may be&#13;
short term) because the bank must be repaid.&#13;
*  A bank cannot charge an interest rate high enough to compensate for a loan which&#13;
cannot be collected.&#13;
*  Create a "watch list" of loans (to check more frequently than other loans) which&#13;
have not deteriorated but which may have signs of problems. An example might&#13;
be loans in an industry which is undergoing some stress.&#13;
*  Early recognition of problem loans should be rewarded and encouraged in a well&#13;
managed banking organization. Unfortunately, in some aggressive banks, "the&#13;
messenger is often shot"--that is the bearer of bad news is punished rather than&#13;
rewarded for surfacing and reporting an incipient bad loan before it becomes a&#13;
write-up. This is a key feature in evaluating the quality of bank management.&#13;
VIII. CONSUMER LOANS&#13;
Another significant area for banks is consumer loans. The management of this portfolio,&#13;
including establishment of a business plan, loan policies, credit approvals, and problem&#13;
loan management, has many similarities to the commercial side.&#13;
However, since consumer loan portfolios are aimed at consumers, a vast array of consumer&#13;
marketing and management techniques are utilized by banks. In a soundly managed bank&#13;
the consumer portfolio should be diversified in terms of product, geography, maturity,&#13;
collateral, and type of borrower. Examination of delinquencies, problem credits, and&#13;
chargeoffs are critical sound banking practices. An advantage of the consumer loan&#13;
business is that it can be highly automated.&#13;
*  Types of Consumer Loans: Credit cards, revolving credits, overdraft lines of credit,&#13;
car and truck loans, home improvement loans, college loans, boat loans, residential&#13;
mortgages, and home equity loans.&#13;
*  Credit Approval. Increasingly, scoring systems (sometimes automated) are being&#13;
developed which assign points for various items in consumer credit applications. For&#13;
example points may be assigned for home ownership, length of time in a job, income&#13;
level, and the like. If the total points exceeds a level established for approvals, the loan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Basic Topics in Sound Bank Mlanagement                                    25&#13;
may qualify for an automatic approval. An advantage of scoring systems is that the&#13;
points required for approvals can be raised or lowered depending on the lender's&#13;
appetite for this kind of credit.&#13;
* Sources: Branch offices, media advertising, direct mail, on-line connections with bank&#13;
customers such as car dealers, "loan by phone," promotions of specific products, and&#13;
acquisitions of companies, or portfolios.&#13;
Trends in the consumer loan business:&#13;
*  Increasing Numbers of Participants. Many non-banking companies have entered&#13;
the business in all areas, i.e., home mortgage lending and credit cards.&#13;
*  Quick Approvals.  Technology and process efficiencies allow  lenders to&#13;
substantially reduce the amount of time to indicate approvals to borrowers. One-&#13;
hour tumarounds for auto loans is not unusual. Even the home mortgage business is&#13;
moving in the direction of faster approvals. (See Credit Scoring on Page 3 of&#13;
Chapter 11, APPROVALS.)&#13;
-  Teaser Interest Rates. Lower rates are offered to attract business; after a specified&#13;
number of months, the rates are automatically increased.&#13;
-  Grace Periods. No payments are required for some number of months after a loan&#13;
is made (although interest is accumulated).&#13;
-  Debt Consolidation. Many loans or credit cards are consolidated into one loan.&#13;
The new loan generally will have a longer maturity and lower payments than the&#13;
original borrowings.&#13;
*  Collections. Automation of the collection process for easier tracking of results is&#13;
common. Automatic dialing of phone numbers is another example.&#13;
Advantages of the Consumer Loan Business:&#13;
*  Cash flows and delinquency rates are predictable based on analysis of historic&#13;
results and experience of lenders with similar portfolios.&#13;
.  Diversification of risk in terms of types of product, customers, collateral,&#13;
geography, and maturity.&#13;
*  Structuring of maturities can be accomplished for asset liability management&#13;
purposes.&#13;
*  Relationship to consumer spending - allows banks to participate in the vast&#13;
consumer spending economy, both in the U.S., and overseas.&#13;

ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS&#13;
Accounting systems are one of the key control mechanisms in the sound management of&#13;
banks. No organization can be managed effectively without an effective accounting system.&#13;
[Differentfromfinancial control--management information, business units, budgets,&#13;
periodic (usually monthly) management reviews.]&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
* An accounting system must record, assemble, and produce accurate financial&#13;
information.&#13;
*  This information translates into the data needed by management to make sound&#13;
business decisions at any time.&#13;
* All accounting systems depend on internal controls, which are simply the policies,&#13;
procedures, and subsystems with which management safeguards assets and&#13;
develops financial information for decision making.&#13;
.  The bank's accounting system provides information to regulators, investors,&#13;
depositors, borrowers, and the public.&#13;
*  The bank's accounting system and its supporting subsystems are unique in that they&#13;
are balanced daily with one another. The bank prepares a daily balance sheet to&#13;
verify that its books are in balance each day. The statement is prepared from the&#13;
general ledger control accounts after all debit and credit activities for the day have&#13;
been posted and proved.&#13;
There are three major components of a bank's accounting system. A brief description of&#13;
each is provided, followed by a more in depth examination of each system.&#13;

Proof and Transit System&#13;
Balances all the bank's financial transactions daily. It captures critical processing data for&#13;
both the general ledger and the subsidiary systems.&#13;
General ledger system&#13;
Summarizes the bank's subsidiary systems into a format that can be used by management&#13;
for planning, control, and review.&#13;
Subsidiary systems&#13;
Designed to account for the bank's assets and liabilities and to generate data for related&#13;
income and expenses.&#13;
1I. PROOF AND TRANSIT SYSTEM&#13;
* The focal point of the bank accounting system. It proves the work and sends cash&#13;
items for collection.&#13;
D The objectives of the Proof and Transit System are:&#13;
1. To segregate all incoming checks for proper distribution.&#13;
2. To forward items (checks) for collection so that funds are available as soon&#13;
as possible.&#13;
3. To determine that deposit and loan payments totals balance with the total&#13;
shown on deposit tickets and loan payment coupons.&#13;
4. To collect data for general ledger and subsystem posting.&#13;
*  The Proof Department receives batches of checks, deposit tickets, and loan&#13;
payments from inside the bank. In addition, it receives checks written by customers&#13;
and outside sources, such as clearing houses and correspondent banks. It proves the&#13;
accuracy of batch totals, re-sorts the items for delivery to other departments for&#13;
further processing, posting to subsidiary records, and reconciliation of totals to the&#13;
general ledger.&#13;

III. GENERAL LEDGER SYSTEM&#13;
*  Generates information and reports for decision making by management.&#13;
*  Daily review of the General Ledger will spot any unusual or significant transactions&#13;
or fluctuations in account balances.&#13;
*  Specifically, General Ledger Systems report income in a two-part format: interest&#13;
income against interest expense, and other income against operational expense.&#13;
*  It accumulates detailed data for numerous account types.&#13;
*  Most banks use the cost center and/or profitability center features available in most&#13;
general ledger packages. Thus management can review each area of a bank&#13;
separately--an example would be a particular product or service which would be&#13;
assigned a separate account number.&#13;
IV. SUBSIDIARY SYSTEMS&#13;
*  Investment Securities and Trading. Bank systems specifically account for each&#13;
security owned and provide for entry of purchases, sales, related revenue&#13;
(dividends, interest, etc.), amortization, and accretion accounts.&#13;
a  Loans. Usually divided into three categories:  Commercial, Real Estate, and&#13;
Consumer. Each is set up on a separate subsidiary system. The systems are&#13;
designed to monitor and process critical information on each loan such as account&#13;
number, original amount, current balance, payment due date, interest rate, accrued&#13;
interest receivable, and collateral and loan documentation.&#13;
*  Fixed Assets. Land, buildings, and equipment compose this category. The system&#13;
records depreciation expense, purchases, and sales of assets.&#13;
*  Demand, Savings, and Certificates of Deposit Accounts.  The systems are&#13;
designed to accrue interest expense daily for interest-bearing accounts,&#13;
automatically calculate service charges, produce customer statements, and account&#13;
for accrued interest and maturities of CDs.&#13;
&#13;

V. INTERNAL ACCOUNTING CONTROLS&#13;
In each bank accounting system and its subsystems, nunerous policies and procedures&#13;
ensure that daily transactions are processed accurately. These policies and procedures are&#13;
known as Internal Controls. Banks' reputations are based on public trust, and a series of&#13;
internal errors or fraud would seriously damage that trust.&#13;
Examples of Internal Controls include segregation of duties, timely approval and review&#13;
procedures, and establishment of monetary limits on transactions by employees.&#13;
Periodic tests of computer systems are necessary to guard against business interruptions,&#13;
fraud, and unacceptable or inaccurate accounting.&#13;
CONCLUSION&#13;
Increasingly, bank accounting systems are being tailored to provide key information to&#13;
management as well as the critical function of keeping the books of the bank. An&#13;
understanding of accounting policies is vital to determining the soundness of a banking&#13;
institution.&#13;

BANK FINANCIAL STATEMENTS&#13;
I. BALANCE SHEET&#13;
In the discussion of sound bank management it is essential to define the categories of&#13;
assets and liabilities which appear on balance sheets.&#13;
Please review the balance sheets of J.P. Morgan and Summit Bancorporation included at&#13;
the end of this chapter. These balance sheets will be referred to again in the case work in&#13;
Chapter 8.&#13;
1. Assets&#13;
*  Cash and Due from Banks. Cash and currency held in the bank vaults, deposits&#13;
with other commercial banks, checks in process of collection, and required reserves&#13;
on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank.&#13;
*  Interest Earning Deposits with Banks. Deposit accounts with other banks which&#13;
earn interest.&#13;
*  Investment Securities. The bank's investment portfolio. Usually broken out to&#13;
show U.S. Government Securities, State and Local govermment Securities, and&#13;
Other Securities (such as corporate bonds or collateralized mortgage obligations).&#13;
This category is broken down further to show:&#13;
A. Securities held to maturity (at market value;)&#13;
B. Securities available for sale (at market value).&#13;
*  Trading Accounts. The assets available for trading activities, including derivative&#13;
instruments, foreign exchange, and other securities. These accounts will be stated&#13;
at market value.&#13;
*  Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell. Repurchase agreements&#13;
acquired by the bank. An arrangement by which a bank provides funds to another&#13;
bank or investor by buying a financial instrument (usually U.S. Treasury&#13;
obligations) while, at the same time, agreeing to sell the instrument back at a&#13;
31&#13;

* specific price and specific time. These arrangements are generally short term, often&#13;
overnight transactions.&#13;
* Federal Funds Sold. Short term (usually overnight) loans to other banks which&#13;
require funds to maintain required reserves with the Federal Reserve Bank.&#13;
* Loans. Credits extended to all borrowers. Includes overdrafts on demand deposit&#13;
accounts.&#13;
* Reserve (Allowance) for Loan Losses. An account which includes the money set&#13;
aside from earnings to cover potential loan losses. Losses are subtracted from this&#13;
account. This allowance is deducted from total loans to show a net loan amount.&#13;
* Accrued Interest Receivable. Interest on loans and securities which has been&#13;
earned but not collected.&#13;
* Premises and Equipment. The value, after subtraction of depreciation, of&#13;
headquarter buildings, branch offices owned, operations centers owned, leasehold&#13;
improvements, and equipment owned.&#13;
* Customers' Acceptance Liability. Bankers acceptances (time drafts) which have&#13;
been executed by a bank customer in favor of the bank. It is the obligation of the&#13;

3. Statement Of Cash Flows&#13;
It is necessary to examine this data in order to understand better the bank's cash flow&#13;
activities from year to year.&#13;
Included are changes in cash provided by, or used in, bank operating activities such as&#13;
profits and depreciation. Changes in cash from investing activities like sales and&#13;
maturities of investment securities are shown in the cash flows. Cash provided or used&#13;
from financing (funding) activities such as federal funds or commercial paper are&#13;
included in this category. Effects of changes in exchange rates are listed in the cash&#13;
flow statement.&#13;
Notes to Financial Statements&#13;
The notes will nearly always provide much more depth of information about the various&#13;
categories on the balance sheet and income and expenditure statement. For example, there&#13;
will be breakdowns of securities, loan portfolios, debt instruments, and trading accounts.&#13;
Accounting methods will be defined and off balance sheet items described.&#13;
Examining the notes is a key analytical step in determining the soundness of a bank.&#13;

RATIO ANALYSIS&#13;
The manual will cover a series of ratios which provide a foundation for analyzing the&#13;
soundness of banks. This section shows how to calculate the ratios, describes their&#13;
purpose, and provide some goals for banks to achieve. These ratios are basic analytical&#13;
tools and are relatively easily calculated In addition, they are generally available to&#13;
analysts in documents published by banks, such as annual reports. While the calculation&#13;
for a given period (such as year end) is important, it is the trend over a series of&#13;
comparable periods which provides a view of the direction of the bank being analyzed The&#13;
section following will cover analytical techniques, which include many of the ratios&#13;
described in this section.&#13;

ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
Asset/Liability Management involves the structuring of the bank's balance sheet to, protect&#13;
depositors and shareholders, and to earn an optimum profit. Soundness of the organization&#13;
is related to the success of this process in that mistakes in structuring assets and liabilities&#13;
can lead directly to funding problems.&#13;
* The Asset/Liability Management process involves taking interest rate exposure,&#13;
which results from the natural dynamics of the marketplace. In addition, because&#13;
banks operate in a highly competitive environment, they are forced to assume&#13;
additional interest rate exposure to maintain adequate earnings.&#13;
* The interest rate exposure must be managed and the only way to do so is for the&#13;
bank to have a definite view on interest rates.&#13;
* It might seem that a safe way to manage assets and liabilities is to have a perfectly&#13;
matched book (the maturities of the assets and liabilities are precisely matched).&#13;
However, to do so would give up earnings opportunities. Of equal importance is&#13;
that it may not be possible in the money markets to fund each loan perfectly.&#13;
II. FORECASTING INTEREST RATES&#13;
Reading and interpreting the yield curve is a widely used part of the process of&#13;
understanding and predicting interest rates. It is published daily in the Wall Street Journal.&#13;
It is a simpler tool to use than a "back box" or computer model, and it is especially&#13;
accurate in predicting long term rates. Most asset and liability managers pay attention to&#13;
the yield curve in their interest rate forecasts. The yield curve is useful in showing&#13;
expectations of the future direction of interest rates. For example, an upward sloping curve&#13;
implies higher rates in the future.&#13;
However, because it is notoriously inaccurate in forecasting short-term rates, other tools&#13;
are used as well.&#13;
47&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48                                                Basic Topics in Sound Bank Afanagernent&#13;
The need to accurately forecast short-term interest rates is critical. For bankers, six months&#13;
is the long run, due to the need to raise funds quickly and the short-tern nature of many&#13;
assets and liabilities. Therefore, there is a vital requirement to forecast correctly the short-&#13;
run shifts in the direction of interest rates. We need look no further than 1994's run up in&#13;
short-term rates to see how important this is.&#13;
. To forecast short-term rates bankers must take into account much subjective&#13;
information and then make some careful judgments. Required factors are to develop&#13;
a view on the actions the Federal Reserve Bank will take to control interest rates, to&#13;
have a view on economic factors such as growth and inflation, to factor in political&#13;
issues, and to consider international markets. Another critical factor is the internal&#13;
cost of funds.&#13;
How to build a view on interest rates:&#13;
* Most banks have an Asset/Liability (ALCO) Committee which is responsible for&#13;
asset/liability management. It consists of the highest managers of the bank and&#13;
receives input from the treasurer and the chief financial officer who are responsible&#13;
for day-to-day management of the portfolio. Input may also be obtained from&#13;
economists and consultants utilized by the bank. The goal of the ALCO Committee&#13;
is to develop a management point of view on rates and to structure the bank's&#13;
balance sheet accordingly.&#13;
* The Histogram. One method used to do this is to create a histogram chart (see&#13;
accompanying chart on the next page) which assigns probabilities to various&#13;
scenarios for changes in rates, then asks ALCO members to make a "best guess" as&#13;
to theprobabilities. Utilizing the histogram, the committee can set policy for short-&#13;
term and long-tern strategic decisions on how the bank will structure its balance&#13;
sheet over time, what assets it should acquire, what funding strategies it should&#13;
pursue, and what liquidity position and interest rate exposure it can take. The&#13;
histogram assists the development of a consensus among the ALCO Committee&#13;
members.&#13;
* When all bank assets and liabilities are listed, there is a maturity structure which&#13;
can be easily determined. It will show if there are gaps in the structure. It is critical&#13;
to recognize the gaps and to take actions which will mitigate the bank's exposure to&#13;
them. These gaps are better described as mismatches of assets and liabilities. An&#13;
example is to fund long-term fixed rate loans with short-term demand deposits&#13;
and/or funds purchased in the short-term money market. This is a common mistake&#13;
in banking in recent years.&#13;
* Marginal cost of funds: It is important to understand this concept. Bankers should&#13;
not confuse the cost of funds which it has booked with the marginal cost of funds.&#13;
If the bank is thinking of acquiring a new asset, the worst mistake it can make is to&#13;
&#13;

measure its potential profit on the new asset by subtracting from its yield the cost of&#13;
funds on its book. Instead, to fund the new asset the bank must acquire funds at the&#13;
margin (the cost offunds at the date of purchase) because the difference between&#13;
the two can be substantial.&#13;
The Short-Run/Long-Run Trade-Off: Trading risk for return. A total dedication to&#13;
near term earnings will almost always work to the bank's disadvantage in the long&#13;
term. A risk-averse management faced with poor quarterly earnings may choose to&#13;
prop up short-term earnings at the expense of accepting.a possible drag on long&#13;
term earnings. This decision should be made consciously, and may not be a bad&#13;
one. A management that wants consistency of earnings should always focus on the&#13;
long-run, that is, year-by-year profits, rather than on the short-run quarter by&#13;
quarter results.&#13;
MII. ADDITIONAL TECHNIQUES FOR RESTRUCTURING ASSET/LIABILITY&#13;
POSITION.&#13;
-  Increasing flexibility and speeding response time to take advantage of rate changes&#13;
a split second before the rest of the market does. This results from access to money&#13;
market information through on-line computers and technology. It is critical to&#13;
managing a portfolio today.&#13;
*  Escaping the balance sheet restraint of capital ratios in the short-run. Banks can&#13;
utilize fitures which are off-balance sheet items to accomplish this (without&#13;
ballooning assets or liabilities on the balance sheet). Two uses of futures are:&#13;
1. Anticipate rate trends by utilizing futures to lock in attractive borrowing rates&#13;
(an example is selling futures in anticipation of a rise in short-termn rates)&#13;
2. Reversing a previously assumed position when the interest rate outlook changes&#13;
(an example is using off balance sheet hedging in the Eurodollar book to deal&#13;
with the fixed maturity aspect of Euro assets and liabilities).&#13;
*  Banks which carefully track their interest rate exposure, formulate their view of the&#13;
direction of interest rates, evaluate their confidence in that view, and then make&#13;
reasoned bets on their view of rates, have mitigated their risks in an appropriate&#13;
way.&#13;
*  Protecting Portfolio Positions. Positions are often hedged against rate changes.&#13;
Astute banks which use hedging will put on and take off hedges in response to&#13;
changes in the level and tone of the market.&#13;

IV. ASSET LIABILITY MANAGEMENT IN HIGH INFLATION ENVIRONMENTS.&#13;
This section includes suggestions on managing assets and liabilities in a high inflation&#13;
period.&#13;
1. Assets&#13;
*  Shorten maturities of loan and investment portfolios.&#13;
*  Mark up interest rates of loans to positive real rates.&#13;
*  Usefloating interest rates increasingly,fixed rates very little.&#13;
*  Lend, as a matter of priority, to borrowers with export production.&#13;
* Lend, as a matter of priority, to borrowers which earn hard currency.&#13;
*  Lend to domestic borrowers and projects which have:&#13;
- Strong demand in real, inflation-adjusted terms.&#13;
- Proven productivity advantages over other industries and competitors.&#13;
- Ability to adjust prices upward to meet strong demand.&#13;
- Few, structured supply bottlenecks.&#13;
*  Develop indexed interest rates to compensate, at least in part, for the erosion by&#13;
inflation of buying and investing power.&#13;
-  Increase frequency of reviews of loan and investment portfolios to detect early&#13;
the increased number of bankruptcies, as borrowers are unable to adjust to&#13;
inflation quickly enough.&#13;
*  Intensify analysis of new, proposed borrowers (and requests for increased loans&#13;
to current borrowers) to ensure that the bank does not get trapped into making&#13;
speculative loans to companies with high leverage.&#13;
2. Liabilities&#13;
*  Fund (take deposits), when possible, in fixed rate obligations.&#13;
*  Pay interest on deposits in relation to the same index used to set borrowing rates&#13;
with a spread (the difference between the rate paid and the rate received) fixed&#13;
in favor of the bank.&#13;
*  Structure the spread in relation to the risk rating and the maturity (term) of the&#13;
loan. The higher the risk rating and the longer the maturity, the wider the&#13;
spread.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
52                                             Basic Topics in Sound Bank A lanagement&#13;
*  Maintain easily saleable securities for purposes of liquidity of the bank (to pay&#13;
depositors), but not for purposes of investment unless indexed or otherwise rate&#13;
protected.&#13;
* Create and use actively an overnight and a daylight interbank (interbranch)&#13;
market to place excess funds and to borrow for temporary liquidity.&#13;
*  An inter-association short-term market among affiliated banks will provide&#13;
greater backup liquidity at lesser risk than interbank operations.&#13;
*  Each should be set up by the bank(s) to provide the protection of several&#13;
different layers of liquidity.&#13;
*  Ensure that additional lines of credit are available from other banks as well as&#13;
from the central bank.&#13;
3. Indexing in High Inflation Conditions&#13;
* To borrow 24,000,000 units and repay 1,000,00 units of principal monthly over&#13;
24 months plus interest at 10% in real terms.&#13;
*  Adjust interest (and principal to, if possible) at least monthly to bring it into&#13;
line with an agreed inflation index.&#13;
*  In the USA, the index would probably be the Consumer Price Index which is a&#13;
weighted number of prices of various commodities and is published monthly.&#13;

CASE STUDY&#13;
I. FRANKLIN NATIONAL BANK&#13;
Franklin National was incorporated in 1926 and through 1966 operated successfully in the&#13;
New York City suburbs of Long Island. In order to take advantage of liberalized branching&#13;
laws, in 1964 it opened a branch in New York City. In 1967 it purchased a bank in New&#13;
York City which had 13 branches.&#13;
Immediately the bank began to make commercial loans to companies in New York City&#13;
and elsewhere. From 1964 to 1969 it expanded its loans from $1.5 billion to $3 billion.&#13;
To take advantage of overseas opportunities, in 1969 Franklin opened a branch in Nassau&#13;
in the Bahamas and a representative office in London. By 1972 the London office was&#13;
upgraded to a full branch. Between 1969 and 1973 its foreign deposits as a percentage of&#13;
total deposits grew from 7.7 to 30.5 percent, and its foreign loans as a percentage of total&#13;
loans grew from 2 to 19.8 per cent.&#13;
In 1972, an Italian financier named Michele Sindona purchased 21.6% of the stock of the&#13;
holding company which owned the bank. Mr. Sindona and one of his associates joined the&#13;
board of directors. Under Mr. Sindona's influence, the bank became a foreign exchange&#13;
dealer so as to benefit from the new era of floating exchange rates. In 1971, the bank was&#13;
trading $19 million of foreign exchange in a given day and three years later that number&#13;
increased to $3.3 billion.&#13;
In 1974, the bank had projected that interest rates would fall and structured its balance&#13;
sheet accordingly. The bank shortened its domestic deposit maturities through large&#13;
purchases of federal funds (the portfolio already had a significant amount of short-term&#13;
borrowings). Also, the bank greatly increased the bond holdings in its trading account.&#13;
Because Mr. Sindona owned several banks in Italy, Franklin was able to enter into foreign&#13;
exchange transactions with these banks. It did so by buying or selling currencies at rates&#13;
that enabled Franklin's foreign exchange activities to show a profit.&#13;
On May 1, 1974 the Federal Reserve Board denied Franklin's applications to purchase a&#13;
finance company called Talcott National Corp.&#13;

II. FIRST PENNSYLVANIA BANK&#13;
In the late 1960s and during the 1970s, First Pennsylvania Bank operated extremely&#13;
successfully and became the largest bank in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was lead by an&#13;
aggressive chief executive officer named John Bunting. His goal was to expand the bank&#13;
into a regional financial conglomerate. Among his strategies were:&#13;
* Heavy emphasis on innovation.&#13;
* Expansion into bond trading.&#13;
* Development of the consumer finance business.&#13;
* Increased mortgage lending.&#13;
In 1971, a bond trading subsidiary was formed which was highly profitable and successful.&#13;
Its traders were regarded as smart and highly knowledgeable professionals. In the late&#13;
1 970s, this subsidiary was buying long bonds and funding them with short-term deposits.&#13;
Likewise, in 1979, the bank purchased a $1.2 billion bond portfolio funded by short-term&#13;
liabilities and it earned substantial initial profits.&#13;
The mortgage lending and consumer lending operations were performing well in the late&#13;
1970s with their portfolios of longer maturities. In order to earn higher interest rates they&#13;
increased their home mortgage and consumer lending to so-called grade B (weaker)&#13;
borrowers.&#13;
A dramatic increase in interest rates occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  In&#13;
October 1979, the Federal Reserve took the following actions in order to better control&#13;
interest rates:&#13;
* Loosened its control over the Federal Funds Rate and let Fed funds trade freely;&#13;
* Increased the reserve requirements on deposits of large banks.&#13;
&#13;

CASE STUDY&#13;
III. FIRST CHICAGO BANK&#13;
The First Chicago Bank was founded in 1863, and was known as a large, conservative&#13;
Midwestern regional bank. Gaylord Freeman was made chairman in 1969. Because the&#13;
bank was prohibited from opening branches in the Chicago area, Mr. Freeman's strategies&#13;
included establishing a holding company with offices around the U.S., and branches and&#13;
affiliates in Europe, and around the world. Growth became the hallmark of the company.&#13;
As a result of the expansion strategies and the emphasis on growth, the bank's loans&#13;
increased three fold between 1969 and 1974. Many different loans were made by the&#13;
bank's rapidly increasing staff of lending officers throughout the world. A specialty was&#13;
established in loans to real estate investment trusts, and $850 million of loans were made.&#13;
By 1975, First Chicago had become the ninth-largest bank in the U.S.&#13;
In order to select his successor, Mr. Freeman announced in 1972 that four top officers were&#13;
in competition for the job. His theory was to let the best man win. In 1979, Robert Abboud&#13;
won the position.&#13;
As interest rates rose in the late 1970s, the bank began to lose many low-cost consumer&#13;
deposits to money-market funds and other higher yielding investments. It also began a&#13;
large program of fixed-rate commercial lending. As a result, First Chicago turned to&#13;
purchasing increasing amounts of short-term money in the money markets.&#13;

THE CASE OF "IF IT COULD GO WRONG, IT" ILL"&#13;
Recently the Auditor of TERM CREDIT BANK (TCB) sent the following&#13;
memorandum to the Chairman and the Board of Directors:&#13;
At your request I personally investigated the WAZY= Branch bad loan and possible&#13;
fraud involving the STRATA Vegetable Cooking Oil Company.&#13;
STRATA was a client in good standing of WYAZYE Branch for several years when&#13;
the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer visited you 18 months ago for a loan of&#13;
Rubles 25,000,000 at the then prevailing value of the Ruble to&#13;
Expand the capacity of the STRATA vegetable cooking oil refining plant in&#13;
WA.ZYE from 1000 to 4000 metric tons per annum - through the purchase and&#13;
installation of a turn k-ey (ready-to-operate) West German machine.&#13;
* Manufacture locally and install related bulk; storage tanks and piping in which&#13;
to store the new production.&#13;
Based on&#13;
- WAZYE Branch good experience with STRATA for several years.&#13;
* Our favorable impression of its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer as a&#13;
vigorous and intelligent person.&#13;
a The apparent, substantial demand for the product.&#13;
* The international reputation of the German manufacturer and machinery.&#13;
* The strong relationships we understood STRATA had with its suppliers of raw&#13;
materials including cotton seed, rape seed, corn, and Yarious other legumes&#13;
commonly converted into cooking oil.&#13;
TCB approved the granting of the loan by WYAYZE Branch to STRATA.&#13;

Almost immediately, problems began:&#13;
STRATAKhad little experience in international transactions. STRATA did not&#13;
anticipate the sudden exchange volatility between the Ruble and the Deutsche&#13;
Mark with the changing to a market economy and free exchange rate. The&#13;
immnediate consequence was that their costs in Ruble terms more than tripled&#13;
before the equipment was shipped 10 months ago.&#13;
* The West German exporter apparently got expropriation, nationalization, and&#13;
payment insurance in Deutsche Mark terms through the German Government&#13;
Insurance Agency Hermes. This does not appear to benefit STRATA.&#13;
* TCB did not provide foreign exchange advice to STRATA. The WAYZE Branch&#13;
Manager who had some international experience was transferred the next&#13;
month to manage a group of branches in another region. His successor as&#13;
Branch Manag,er has no international experience and only two years domestic&#13;
banking experience.&#13;
*  Te new WAYZE Branch Manager says he had every intention of following the&#13;
STRATA loan but he was very busy indoctrinating new staff and learning his&#13;
own new responsibilities. He also did not really know STRATA manaoement.&#13;
*  STRATA management was NOT able to plan for and executesimultaneously&#13;
- building the specially reinforced floor for the new machine&#13;
- overseeing the construction of the new tanks and pipelines&#13;
- neg,otiating with suppliers for the increased flow of raw materials, especially as&#13;
suppliers wanted higher prices than anticipated (to make up for their increased&#13;
costs to raise and harvest) and were taking from 10 to 12 days longer to ship&#13;
raw materials because of highway repair problems and diesel fuel shortages&#13;

- getting plant workers to work harder and more effectively on these projects&#13;
- negotiating with the same workers for additional salary and benefit payments&#13;
almost evQery two weeks, as ihe buying power of the ruble declined&#13;
- ensuring that the supply of electricity would be increased (and special wirina&#13;
in place) in time for the new plant opening&#13;
- improving the output of the old machinery and tying it to the output of the new&#13;
machinery to achieve increased production beyond the rated capacity of both&#13;
plants&#13;
- preparing the raw materials for feeding into the new machinery which requires&#13;
two unanticipated, additional washing and mashing steps not needed with the&#13;
old machinery&#13;
- and getting the new plant to function properly since training the work-ers to&#13;
run it and coaching them in daily preventative maintenance was much more&#13;
difficult and time-consuming than planned for.&#13;
e All these factors plus difricult cold weather delayed construction including&#13;
setting of concrete and installation of the new machinery and the new tanks for&#13;
more than 70 days.&#13;
* The financial impact of these problems has been enormous:&#13;
- During this period the Ruble devalued from 100 per US$1 to 375 per USS1&#13;
with a similar impact on the Ruble-Deutsche Mark with the result that the&#13;
company was required to pay additional Rubles 66,000,000 for the new plant.&#13;
- Additional costs for the other problems listed above is probably over Rubles&#13;
30,000,000, although the total cost is lost in a number of separate expense&#13;
vouchers that the STRATA accounting department (only two staff, one adding&#13;
machine, all hand-posted ledgers) is about 45 days behind time in posting.&#13;

- Fuel costs alone are probably about Rubles 11,000,000 so the Rubles&#13;
30,000,000 is surely a low figure.&#13;
- The Chairman of STRATA was hospitalized for ten days in the middle of this&#13;
with a bleeding ulcer, caused by extreme stress and by sleeping and eating at the&#13;
plant and working 18 hour days for over five months. His spouse is alleged to&#13;
be threatening to divorce him because he has not even eaten at their apartment&#13;
for the last month and one half.&#13;
- The President of STRATA who negotiated many of the external contractor and&#13;
supply agreements, particularly with raw materials suppliers and construction&#13;
companies, has been accused of asking for a percentage of each contract.&#13;
- Suppliers reported him because he was asking for over 20%7a whereas he had&#13;
previously requested 10 to 12 %. He has been suspended from his job pending&#13;
the outcome of investigations, although the police backlog of work is so large&#13;
that they weill not be able to start a proper investigation until early next year.&#13;
- A preliminary estimate of the extent of losses involving overbilling to&#13;
compensate suppliers for these payments may be as high as Rubles 9,000,000.&#13;
- Production of vegetable cooldng oil during this period has been declining due&#13;
to poor work habits among laborers and to breakdowns in the old machinery as&#13;
well as the transfer of several of the best maintenance workers from the old&#13;
plant to help set up the new.&#13;
- For this reason, sales not made over the last 10 months could exceed Rubles&#13;
26,000,00 on which the usual profit margin would have been 14%.&#13;
- Old and new machinery are now both working, but not near capacity. No loan&#13;
payments of principal or interest have been made in 6 months. Cash flow is&#13;
barely enough to pay essential expenses. Cooling oil demand appears good.&#13;
- A recent test of the vegetable cookling oil being produced showed that it was&#13;
somewhat higher in impurities, contamination, and radiation than previously&#13;
recorded, although apparently still within ranges or norms set some years ago&#13;
by the Agricultural Department. The question is whether these norms are still&#13;
valid, given some of the pollutants now carried by air and water.&#13;

- The Chairman reports that the storage tanks are almost full, although an on-&#13;
site inspection last Friday at which I was present indicates that the water&#13;
content (moisture percentage) is about 17%. This shows that some oil has been&#13;
siphoned off and replaced by water. The usual water percentage is between 1%&#13;
and 2%.&#13;
- This situation would indicate some theft which must be investigated, and that&#13;
the inventory is worth about 15% less than it would appear, and that the oil in&#13;
storage must be re filtered or further refined to get the water content down to an&#13;
acceptable level.&#13;

BANK ANALYSIS: CAMEL RATING SYSTEM&#13;
A common method for evaluating the soundness of U.S. Banks is to understand the&#13;
CAMEL Rating System. This system was designed by regulatory authorities to quantify&#13;
the performance and the financial condition of the banks which it regulates. This chapter is&#13;
intended as an introduction to the rating system and does not attempt to provide all of the&#13;
information required to calculate the ratio. The important issue is to understand the concept&#13;
of this kind of system.&#13;
The system serves as a report card to bank management and directors. Regulators utilize it&#13;
to compare and contrast the banks which they cover. The Federal Reserve Bank, the&#13;
Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation all use the&#13;
CAMEL System.&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
Each letter of the word CAMEL covers a separate part of the rating:&#13;
C = CAPITAL ADEQUACY. The amount of capital which the bank has to protect its&#13;
depositors. Ratios are used for this part of the evaluation. The core includes common&#13;
and preferred stock, retained profits, and general or legal reserves. Supplementary&#13;
capital includes revaluation reserves on fixed assets, unencumbered provisions for&#13;
future loan losses, and various types of debt instruments which can be subordinated&#13;
to depositors.&#13;
A = ASSET QUALITY. An assessment of the collectability of the bank's assets and off&#13;
balance sheet items. This is determined at an on-site examination of the bank.&#13;
Problem loans are classified based on a detailed analysis of collectability. The&#13;
classifications are substandard, doubtful, and loss--they are used to judge the&#13;
adequacy of the provision for loan losses.&#13;
M = MANAGEMENT. An evaluation of management based on performance, policies&#13;
established, controls, depth, and adherence to law and regulation. Policies examined&#13;
include critical banking areas such as lending, foreign exchange, and liquidity.&#13;
Systems and controls are evaluated to ensure policies are carried out and adhered to.&#13;
Adherence to laws and regulations includes timely and accurate submission of reports&#13;
73&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

to the regulators. Management depth means the development of executives. It is the&#13;
last element analyzed because it includes the others, and it certainly is subjective.&#13;
E = EARNINGS/PROFITABILITY. A measurement of profitability to see if it is&#13;
sufficient to fund future growth. Return on Average Assets (ROA) is the ratio used&#13;
for this part of the evaluation. ROA is calculated:&#13;
Net Profit After Tax (Before payment of dividends)&#13;
Average Assets in the which the Profit was earned&#13;
Non-recurring items and adherence to proper accounting standards are also&#13;
considered in evaluating earnings.&#13;
L = LIQUIDITY. A determination of whether the bank is liquid enough to meet regular&#13;
and most unplanned obligations. This means the bank must be able to quickly convert&#13;
assets to cash, or raise funds quickly to meet obligations. The latter can be&#13;
accomplished by having available back-up sources. Several ratios are utilized here.&#13;
The review consists of checking to see that policies are in place to set liquidity targets&#13;
and limits to meet statutory requirements, determining if reporting systems and data&#13;
bases are sufficient to provide quick and accurate information on a bank's position,&#13;
and seeing the amount of reliance placed on deposits or other funding which can be&#13;
withdrawn on short notice. The review is conducted with a combination of on-site&#13;
examination and calculation of ratios.&#13;
II. COMPOSITE RATING&#13;
Once the five factors have been completed, a Composite Overall Rating is given to the&#13;
bank. The Composite Rating is determined as follows:&#13;
*  Each of the five components is rated from one (strongest) to five (unsatisfactory).&#13;
*  The five ratings are added together and divided by five to deternine the composite&#13;
rating.&#13;
*  The regulators then have a number which indicates whether the bank is sound&#13;
(strong,) satisfactory, fair, marginal, or unsatisfactory.&#13;
*  Most importantly, the composite rating is an important indicator of the extent and&#13;
degree of follow up or supervisory action that may need to be taken with the bank.&#13;
*  Of course, the CAMEL Rating system is only as effective as the skills and&#13;
judgment of the regulators who are doing the examinations.&#13;

CONCLUSION&#13;
An understanding of the CAMEL rating system greatly assists the process of evaluating&#13;
sound banking practices. Most of the critical issues in sound management of banks are&#13;
covered at least in a general way in the CAMEL system. However, because the details of&#13;
CAMEL ratings are not available to the public (and often the ratings themselves are not&#13;
available,) other techniques for analyzing the soundness of banks are necessary. These&#13;
techniques can often be used by evaluating information that is available to the public in the&#13;
form of annual reports to shareholders, reports submitted to securities regulators, and&#13;
articles in the press. The manual provides several analytical techniques and discussions of&#13;
issues such as accounting practices which can affect bank soundness.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

BANK CAPITAL ADEQUACY&#13;
Another of the key indicators of the condition of banks is the adequacy of their capital.&#13;
This manual has made several references to adequacy of capital, and provided some ratios&#13;
to examine. This issue took on great importance in worldwide banking in the late 1980s&#13;
and early 1 990s, with the creation of Risk Based capital guidelines.&#13;
In the late 1980s, international banking regulators developed a system which defined&#13;
capital ratios for banks. The Bank for International Settlements actually provided the forum&#13;
for negotiating the agreement. Twelve countries initially joined the negotiations and&#13;
adopted the system. The U.S. Federal Reserve Board required its member banks to adhere&#13;
to the capital adequacy ratios in 1991-92. The purpose of the ratios is to require banks to&#13;
increase their capital to the levels of the ratios in the wake of loan losses of the 1980s.&#13;
Most important, these guidelines are now part of the CAMEL Rating system. The upshot&#13;
of the adoption of this system is that most banks were required to raise capital. The&#13;
majority of banks chose to exceed the criteria for "well capitalized banks."&#13;
The guidelines are called Risk Based Capital and consist of three ratios:&#13;
I. Tier 1 Capital to Risk Based Assets Ratio:&#13;
Tier I Capital (Common stock, Preferred stock. Reserves, Retained Earnings)&#13;
Risk Based Assets (Loans, Trading Accounts, Investments)&#13;
The minimum requirements to meet this ratio are:&#13;
* Well Capitalized Banks - 6%.&#13;
* Adequately Capitalized Banks - 4%.&#13;
Undercapitalized Banks - Under 4%.&#13;
77&#13;
&#13;

II. Total Capital to Risk Based Assets Ratio&#13;
Tier 2 Capital consists of debentures, subordinated debt,&#13;
capital notes, and loan loss reserves.&#13;
Tier I plus Tier 2 Capital (Total capital)&#13;
Risk Based assets&#13;
The minimum requirements to meet this ratio are:&#13;
* 10% in Well Capitalized Banks.&#13;
* 6% in Adequately Capitalized Banks.&#13;
* Under 6% in Undercapitalized Banks.&#13;
III. Tier 1 Capital to Average Total Assets Ratio (also known as Leverage)&#13;
Tier I Capital&#13;
Average Total Assets&#13;
This ratio must exceed:&#13;
* 5% in Well Capitalized Banks.&#13;
* 4% in Adequately Capitalized Banks.&#13;
* Under 4% in Undercapitalized Banks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
BANK QUALITY ANALYSIS&#13;
Sound bank management involves a review of a number of quality issues:&#13;
*  Credit Quality. Much discussed in previous sections of the manual. It is generally&#13;
the first place to look in evaluating a lending institution.&#13;
*  Investment Quality. Another area of interest is the quality of the investment&#13;
portfolio in terms of the financial instruments (such as government bonds) in which a&#13;
bank invests. No matter how well an investment fits into the bank's asset and liability&#13;
plan or its liquidity plan, an investment in an instrument which deteriorates in quality&#13;
(and causes losses) is a red flag in sound management. Generally banks have written&#13;
policies for the investment portfolio including required ratings from rating agencies,&#13;
diversification, maturities, and the like.&#13;
*  Management Quality. Management quality is viewed in terms of its ability to work&#13;
with all of the institution's activities and produce desired results. Viewing&#13;
management in light of its experience in leading an organization in difficult economic&#13;
times is a good opportunity to assess its effectiveness. The issues on management&#13;
discussed in the CAMEL Ratings Section of the manual are useful in looking at&#13;
management.&#13;
* Earnings Quality. We have discussed earnings quality a number of times. However,&#13;
earnings quality is important enough to emphasize again.&#13;
The factors which influence earnings quality are most often directly under the control&#13;
of management of banks. Factors which influence earnings quality include:&#13;
1. Selection of accounting techniques: This is an important area for review in many&#13;
corporations and in banking. Often different accounting techniques can be used to&#13;
account for items on the balance sheet and income statement. For example, there&#13;
is much debate in the industry on whether loans should listed on bank balance&#13;
sheets at their market value rather than book value to properly reflect their current&#13;
worth.&#13;
2. More important, is the treatment of non-recurring or one time items such as sales&#13;
of fixed assets (buildings, etc.) or gains and losses on securities transactions.&#13;
The goal is to deternine what the bank is earning from its on-going operations and to&#13;
segregate non-recurring item. The latter then can be analyzed separately.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

BANK LIQUIDITY ANALYSIS&#13;
Sound bank management always involves prudent actions to assure liquidity. Adequate&#13;
liquidity to deal with commitments and unanticipated need for funds at a reasonable price&#13;
is a hallmark of a well-managed banking company. In previous sections, the manual&#13;
discussed ratios used in calculating liquidity and how liquidity is measured in CAMEL&#13;
ratings. In this section, liquidity will be examined in more detail.&#13;
1. BACKGROUND&#13;
In reality, liquidity and interest rate exposure are directly linked-changing one always&#13;
alters the other. For example, suppose a bank that is funding variable rate (floating rate)&#13;
loans decides that it needs more liquidity. In order to obtain it, the bank must buy a large&#13;
amount of six-month CD money. By doing so, the bank increases its liquidity, but at the&#13;
same time it increases its interest rate exposure. This is because if interest rates fall, the&#13;
bank may be funding with high cost long-term money, but loan yields are falling or even&#13;
tumbling down. The rates on the loans are falling because they are floating, but the CDs&#13;
funding them are paying a fixed rate of interest.&#13;
* As a first step in managing a balance sheet, the banker must separate liquidity and&#13;
interest rate exposure by determining the amounts of liquidity and rate exposure.&#13;
This accomplishes several things:&#13;
1. provides knowledge of exactly where the bank stands at the present time;&#13;
2. clarifies the implications of any moves that might be made;&#13;
3. prevents the bank from falling into the trap of making a liquidity decision&#13;
when it thinks it is making an interest rate exposure decision and vice versa.&#13;
Remember, the definition of liquidity: having money when the bank needs it. Specifically,&#13;
the ability to ensure the availability of funds to meet commitments at a reasonable price at&#13;
all times.&#13;

II. FUNCTIONS OF LIQUIDITY&#13;
Reassurance to creditors, especially retail depositors, holders of certificates of&#13;
deposit, time deposits, repurchase agreements, other financial institutions (such as&#13;
correspondent banks), and holders of debt securities. Lack of liquidity and public&#13;
knowledge of it can lead to a "run" on the bank.&#13;
* Ensures ability to meet prior commitments such as commitments to make loans.&#13;
These commitments can be legal and fornal, such as revolving credit loans or&#13;
informal, such as a typical seasonal line of credit.&#13;
* Avoids forced sales of assets. For example, if a bank becomes illiquid in a high&#13;
interest rate environment, it can be forced to sell securities at a likely substantial&#13;
discount. In addition, it can be forced to sell loans-also at a discount.&#13;
* Precludes having to "pay up" in the market. A bank with liquidity problems will&#13;
surely have to pay substantially higher rates for deposits, CDs, debt securities, and&#13;
the like. As an example, consider two banks operating in the following&#13;
environment: in 1980, interest rates were high and about to peak. One bank, having&#13;
correctly anticipated a possible peak in rates, protected itself by buying long-term&#13;
funds and thus could stay out of the market for a long time. The other bank,&#13;
counting on a downturn in rates which never materialized, relied too much on&#13;
purchases of overnight funds (short-term money) and was forced to add to its&#13;
liquidity by buying long term funds at the worst possible time-when rates were at&#13;
their peak.&#13;
* Avoids use of the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The Federal Reserve Bank&#13;
is the "lender of last resort" for banks, and any institutions utilizing it can be&#13;
assured of increased scrutiny or more likely punitive actions.&#13;
III. SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY&#13;
*  Assets maturing in the near term. These include securities and money market&#13;
instrunments, maturing loans which are not renewed, and loan payments. Another&#13;
technique is increasing the interest rates on loans (usually short-terrn loans) as they&#13;
mature. The interest rates on loans such as broker loans can be increased, and the&#13;
borrowers will repay them by using available credit at other banks.&#13;
* Readily salable short-term assets. This includes assets that are near maturity and&#13;
that can be counted on for a bid (includes long-terrn securities nearing maturity and&#13;
money market instruments). Usually the bank can rely on these securities being&#13;
sold at or near book value. Interestingly, most large banks cannot count on sales of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

government bonds for liquidity, because they have already sold them in repurchase&#13;
agreements and must repay the repurchase agreement when the bonds are sold.&#13;
*  Access to purchasable funds. The ability to sell CDs both domestic and Euro, to&#13;
buy Federal Funds, to buy Euro Time Deposits, to do more repurchase agreements.&#13;
Wide discrepancies exist among banks in their access to purchased money. The&#13;
discrepancies reflect the fact that an individual bank's access to purchased money is&#13;
directly and positively related to its size and with the market's perception of how&#13;
good a name it is, that is, its credit worthiness.&#13;
*  Loan participations.  By participating out pieces of loans, banks can raise&#13;
liquidity. It may do this in times of lack of liquidity.&#13;
*  Liquidity cushion. In purchasing funds, it is a good rule for a bank that cannot&#13;
always immediately buy whatever amount of new money it may need, to buy more&#13;
money than it needs to support its present asset structure. This is called a liquidity&#13;
cushion. There are two good reasons for such cushions:&#13;
1. A bank lacking a cushion could see a terrific opportunity but not be able to take&#13;
advantage of it because it has no money to do so, and cannot raise the money&#13;
rapidly enough or at all. Example: a bank may have an opportunity to purchase&#13;
a $5 million safe loan at the good rate of prime plus 1% but cannot do it due to&#13;
lack of liquidity.&#13;
2. The cushion ensures that forced liquidation of desirable assets will not take&#13;
place.&#13;
* Last resort borrowing. Many banks have available lines of credit with other&#13;
banks (often correspondent banks) so they can raise funds on a temporary basis.&#13;
IV. DETERMINING LIQUIDITY NEEDS&#13;
To determine liquidity, three types of information are required:&#13;
I. Projections of absolute liquidity requirements, which means forecasting loan&#13;
demand, deposit levels, and shifts in customer loan and deposit preferences.&#13;
2. Forecasts of interest rates.&#13;
3. Determinations of its confidence in its projections-if less confident, a larger&#13;
liquidity cushion should be established.&#13;
*  Forecasting loan demand.  Econometric models based on macroeconomic&#13;
forecasts can be used, although historically they have been unreliable. Another&#13;
method is called the building block approach. This involves checking what is in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
84                                               Basic Topics inl Sounld Bank Atanagenient&#13;
pipeline and making estimates based on this, and interest rate forecasts (if rates are&#13;
high, loan demand will be, as well).&#13;
. Forecasting deposits. Forecasting demand deposits can be done with some&#13;
accuracy as they often follow predictable and seasonal trends.&#13;
* Predicting shifts in customer preferences. Banks must try to perceive the trend&#13;
in interest rates before its customers do and predict how the customers will react to&#13;
the trend. For example, suppose a bank feels early on that rates. are going to rise.&#13;
Then it knows that sooner or later its borrowers will request longer maturities&#13;
because they want to lock in rates.&#13;
* Assessing the outlook for rates. Banks need to know is whether rates are going to&#13;
rise or fall. However getting the correct forecast down to the last ten basis points is&#13;
unnecessary. The shape of the yield curve is a useful tool in assessing general&#13;
expectations on rates. For example, if the bank anticipates a rise in rates and the&#13;
yield curve is steeply positive, the yield curve is saying that the bank's expectations&#13;
on rates coincide with general expectations. Thus. the bank should move quickly to&#13;
acquire additional liquidity. Conversely, a negatively sloped yield curve would&#13;
suggest that the world disagrees with the view of the bank.&#13;
* Degree of confidence. The bank's need for liquidity will always be inversely&#13;
correlated with the degree of certainty that it feels about the future-this is a good&#13;
rule to keep in mind in the sound management of a bank.&#13;
V. LIQUID: TO BE OR NOT TO BE&#13;
If the bank has a high degree of confidence in its rate predictions there are times to take&#13;
risks:&#13;
* If the bank is convinced that rates are going to tumble, it is an opportunity to be as&#13;
liquid as the bank dares. This is the moment to lend long-term at peak rates, let CDs&#13;
run off, and to borrow heavily in the overnight market.&#13;
* Conversely, the best time for a bank to be as liquid as possible, even to the point of&#13;
being overly liquid, is when interest rates have been low and are about to rise.&#13;
Implications of too much or too little liquidity: Too much or too little liquidity over a long&#13;
period of time will cost the bank money.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

BANK ANALYSIS&#13;
Before discussing the analytical techniques themselves, it is useful to look again at the key&#13;
risks in the banking business. Because sound bank management involves risk management,&#13;
this manual emphasizes risk control and assessment as critical issues.&#13;
I. THE SEVEN DEADLY RISKS OF BANKING&#13;
1. Asset quality risk. Asset quality risk is the inability to collect 100 cents on the&#13;
dollar. The margin of error is small-losses of 3% can cause a severe risk of&#13;
failure. Interestingly, charge offs are usually not a sign of pending failure because&#13;
they occur too late in the failure process. Levels of non-performing loans or non-&#13;
accruing loans are a sign of asset quality problems, however, like charge offs, they&#13;
are numbers which are calculated after problems occur. Better indicators are sudden&#13;
build-ups or large increases in loan categories.&#13;
2. Funding risk. This risk is the refusal of unsecured creditors such as holders of&#13;
CDs to renew. An example is Continental Illinois Bank which at the time was the&#13;
second largest bank in Chicago and one of the 25 largest banks in the IJ.S. When its&#13;
large holders of CDs refused to renew, a literal "run" on the bank resulted and the&#13;
U.S. government regulators were required to bail out the bank.&#13;
3. Interest rate risk. Essentially, funding fixed-rate assets with floating rate sources&#13;
or vice versa in periods of dramatic changes in interest rates. The best example in&#13;
the savings bank industry is the United States in the early 1980s. The savings bank&#13;
loan portfolios were primarily long-term fixed-rate home mortgages, funded by&#13;
short-term deposits. When the interest rates which they paid on deposits rose&#13;
rapidly, the thrifts had to "pay up" in order to roll over the deposits. The banks'&#13;
interest margins declined precipitously. Soon the interest paid on deposits exceeded&#13;
the fixed-rate mortgages and a classic mismatch or disintermediation occurred. In&#13;
large banks, losses can result due to interest rate mismatches, but it is usually not&#13;
fatal because of the banks' access to different sources of deposits and loans.&#13;
4. Control risk. Losses arising from other than lending money. Fraud is the best&#13;
example. Failure to follow procedures or limits established to define authorities are&#13;
other examples. Poor loan documentation is an area of high vulnerability. All banks&#13;

&#13;

5. can fall victim to control problems. Start up ventures should be watched carefully&#13;
for control problems.&#13;
5. Overhead risk. Operating expenses so high that speculative ventures are designed&#13;
to cover costs. An example is Franklin National Bank, which in the early 1970s&#13;
expanded into the high-cost New York City market to compete with the large and&#13;
well-established banks. It attracted only business with low margins and thus could&#13;
not cover costs.&#13;
6. Strategy risk. The selection of a dead-end corporate strategy. Continental Illinois&#13;
again provides a good example in its aim to become the largest corporate lender in&#13;
the U.S. and its resulting low-profit margins and loan losses.&#13;
7. Capital risk. A bank in the U.S. must meet the government requirements for&#13;
capital. More important, a bank must be able to attract new capital in the capital&#13;
markets--it must be regarded highly enough to attract the new capital.&#13;
II. BANK FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - THE BASIS OF ANALYSIS&#13;
In each factor in the analytical process, the manual shows an Analytical Model, which&#13;
provides an alternative to the presentations in bank-published financial material. The&#13;
financial statements of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., Incorporated and The Summit Bancorporation&#13;
will be used as cases for practicing analytical techniques.&#13;
1. Important Factors in the Analytical Process -&#13;
A. Bank balance sheets are not structured in order of maturity&#13;
and marketability.&#13;
In businesses other than banking, assets and liabilities are presented in financial&#13;
statements in order of their closeness to cash, which is in turn a function of&#13;
maturity and especially marketability.&#13;
Analytical Model. Temporary investments are the closest to cash of all categories.&#13;
They include Federal Funds sold, time deposits in other banks, and investment&#13;
securities due in one year or less. Separating bank assets into earning and non-&#13;
earning assets is critical in providing a more accurate analysis of the bank. Many&#13;
ratios and analytical techniques used in the manual will refer to earning and non-&#13;
earning assets.&#13;
&#13;

greater than $100 million.&#13;
=&gt; Other Liabilities-Long-term debt, debentures, subordinated debt&#13;
Capital-Comnon Stock, Preferred Stock&#13;
B. Bank balance sheets may not reflect the realities and practices&#13;
of banking today.&#13;
*  Balance sheets contain more detail on investments than on loans-there is often&#13;
not enough description of the maturity, industry concentration, rate-sensitivity,&#13;
or credit risk of the loan portfolio or the trends of performance.&#13;
*  They do not adequately distinguish between the various kinds of deposits-for&#13;
example, it implies that "Cash and Due from Banks" is spendable, which it&#13;
often is not.&#13;
*  Most important, there is often not enough description of the increasing amounts&#13;
of "off balance sheet" items such as loan commitments, standby letters of&#13;
credit, loan sales, and derivatives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Analytical Model. Increased detail is necessary to properly evaluate major balance&#13;
sheet categories. In summarizing investments, tax exempt and taxable securities should&#13;
be separated. Tax exempts should be detailed because:&#13;
=&gt; Banks have a limit on their ability to shelter tax-free income since tax-exempt&#13;
securities use up most of that capacity.&#13;
&gt; Many banks purchase local tax-exempt instruments which can be non-&#13;
marketable.&#13;
=&gt; The tax-equivalent yield on tax-exempt securities usually exceeds other&#13;
investment yields and can exceed loan yields.&#13;
Details on loans not usually described in bank financial statements includes in-depth&#13;
descriptions of foreign loans, maturities, interest rate sensitivity, industry, and&#13;
geographic concentrations, co-variance risk (does a problem with one area affect others&#13;
i.e., if oil prices in a region drop, what happens to real estate prices?) and intrinsic&#13;
credit risk. Also, detailed breakdowns of consumer loan portfolios including home&#13;
mortgages, credit cards, car loans, etc., is useful.&#13;
C. Bank Profit and Loss statements do not clearly organize the&#13;
various sources of profitability.&#13;
* Gross profit (after interest expense), which is the income available to pay operating&#13;
expenses, is not included.&#13;
*  The fully tax-equivalent income resulting from tax-sheltered assets (the only reason&#13;
these assets are acquired) is lacking.&#13;
* A simple summary of all the operating expenses is usually not shown.&#13;
Analytical Model. A Summary Income Statement as follows is recommended:&#13;
=&gt; Interest Income less Interest Expense=Net Interest Income.&#13;
= Add Non Interest Income (Fees) except Securities Gains/Losses=Adjusted&#13;
Operating Income. Inc.&#13;
=&gt; Less Loan Loss Provision}&#13;
Less Operating Expenses}=Pretax Net Operating Income.&#13;
=  Less Applicable Income Taxes.&#13;
=&gt; Plus or Minus Securities Gains/Losses=Net Income.&#13;

Bank Solvency and Safety Akechanisrns                                      89&#13;
This format was adopted by the regulatory agencies in 1983 but it is useful to examine&#13;
it as a reminder.&#13;
Note: Extraordinary Items (Non-Recurring Items) or one-time events should be&#13;
examined carefully and not included as part of ongoing operations. Also, expenses&#13;
related to OREO (other real estate owned-foreclosed properties) should be analyzed&#13;
separately from ongoing operations.&#13;
D. Bank assets and liabilities are not presented on an average basis.&#13;
*  End of period listings of assets and liabilities can be extremely misleading. Some&#13;
banks build up assets at period ends for various purposes in a process called&#13;
"window dressing."&#13;
*  Averaging best reflects the business of the institution for the period under review.&#13;
*  Ratios calculating yield and margins can be meaningfully computed only if&#13;
averages are used.  For example, interest income is accumulated every day and&#13;
thus average loans should be used in calculating the yield on loans.&#13;
Analytical Model. If the bank being analyzed uses period end numbers instead of&#13;
averages, the period end numbers for the previous periods can be used (for example,&#13;
four period end quarters).&#13;
E. There is insufficient recognition in bank balance sheets that assets&#13;
have realizable values, which can be different from their carrying&#13;
values.&#13;
Loans are the best example of this. Loans to Latin American countries made in the&#13;
early 1980s are particularly relevant. If loans of this type are "marked to market" it&#13;
has an effect both on net worth and the income statement.&#13;
Analytical Model. Look at asset yield rates to determine potentially under performing&#13;
assets. Assets with an extremely high yield can also be high risk. One bank's Project&#13;
Finance Loan Portfolio of $400 million is an example-it generated huge fees and high&#13;
interest rate yields but an almost 100% write-off.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

F. Bank financial statements may not be adjusted to reflect mergers&#13;
and acquisitions made during the period.&#13;
Merger adjusted history is preferable in order to make comparisons with past&#13;
history. For example, a bank which does not adjust its historic financial statements&#13;
to include a merger can grossly overstate its rate of growth in loans, etc.&#13;
Analytical Model. Statements should be adjusted to show how the bank would look if&#13;
the mergers had been completed in the past.&#13;
G. The Analysis of Trends is Critical to Understanding the Direction&#13;
of Any Bank.&#13;
* This is a simple statement, but the examination of trends over a four- or five-year&#13;
period is a vital part of analysis. It can detect potential problems, spot new and&#13;
potentially risky businesses, or show positive developments.&#13;
III. BANK ANALYSIS&#13;
The analysis of bank profits is a key to the overall analysis of any bank. An organization&#13;
which loses money year after year can sometimes attract more capital, but it must&#13;
eventually return to profitability if it is to be economically viable.&#13;
Profits are essential to:&#13;
* Absorb loan losses and to build adequate reserves.&#13;
* Finance the internal growth of capital so as to attract investors' capital.&#13;
* Attract (or be attracted by) merger partners.&#13;
* To help a bank holding company meet cash flow needs.&#13;
Four of the ratios already discussed can be used to analyze profitability:&#13;
* Return on Average Assets-ROA&#13;
* Return on Equity Capital-ROE&#13;
* Growth of Net Income (period to period) -The source of next year's ROA and&#13;
ROE.&#13;

Bank Solvency and Safely Afechlanisms                                     91&#13;
* Securities Gains and Losses-Securities gains may mask operating problems;&#13;
conversely, securities losses may cover-up efficient operations.&#13;
Two other considerations are important when looking at bank earnings:&#13;
* Non-recurring gains such as the sale of a piece of real estate can mask operating&#13;
problems in the same manner as securities gains. Also, the loan loss provision may&#13;
be overstated or understated at the discretion of bank management.&#13;
* If bank dividends are used to service holding company debt, the profitability of the&#13;
bank may be distorted because the payment of debt interest is not recognized as an&#13;
expense.&#13;
Analytical Point. It is critical to determine if profitability is being overstated or&#13;
distorted and the reasons for it.&#13;
The ratios, which are indicators of bank profitability, are now evaluated in more detail as a&#13;
follow up to our previous discussion of ratios. The ratios are now actually being used to&#13;
understand better what is going on with bank profitability.&#13;
* ROA Ratio. This ratio definitely varies according to the size of the bank. Thus the&#13;
analyst should only compare banks of similar size. Generally speaking, smaller&#13;
banks earn 1.5% or more on their assets, while larger banks earn less. This is&#13;
primarily because larger banks usually have more wholesale (corporate) business&#13;
and operate on lower profit margins. Also, the proportion of common equity (which&#13;
earns no interest) may be higher in the smaller banks (equity to average assets-also&#13;
called leverage-in smaller banks can often be twice as high as larger banks). This&#13;
has an obvious effect on ROA.&#13;
* ROE Ratio. This ratio is extremely dependent on the equity to average assets&#13;
(leverage) ratio. The ROE of a bank with a lower equity to average assets ratio will&#13;
be higher than that of a bank with a higher ratio. In other words, ROEs generally&#13;
will be higher in banks with lower amounts of equity than their peers, if earnings&#13;
are relatively the same.&#13;

an ROE of 15%? Answer: 5%.&#13;
2) Given an equity leverage of 6%, what ROA is required to produce an ROE of&#13;
20%? Answer: Almost 1.25%.&#13;
*  Net income % Change Ratio. Comparing period to period net income percent&#13;
changes is a key ratio, as it measures positive or negative performance in&#13;
profitability.&#13;
Earnings per share changes are important because again, earnings can be distorted if&#13;
more shares are issued and profitability does not increase proportionately. For&#13;
example, if net income grows 10% but there are 11% more shares outstanding,&#13;
earmings per share will decrease 1%.&#13;
Two cautions when analyzing net income growth:&#13;
1. Small distortions in either of the two periods being measured can have a&#13;
significant effect on the percentage change. Example: if a bank shifts from a&#13;
policy of building its loan loss reserve to one of depleting it (or vice-versa,) the&#13;
effect on earnings change will be significant.&#13;
2. Net income growth percentages are apt to be magnified when the ROA is&#13;
depressed (when earnings are low). This volatility can be misleading-a 50%&#13;
growth in earnings will have a smaller effect on ROA if the starting ROA is low&#13;
rather than high.&#13;
* Securities Gains/Losses (Net) to Net Income. The key here is that gains or losses&#13;
are often discretionary and postponable rather than the recurring product of an&#13;
actively managed portfolio. Clearly these transactions should be treated as separate&#13;
activities and analyzed separately as well.&#13;
SUMMARY: The above ratios are informative in increasing knowledge of the&#13;
soundness and profitability of the bank. The next section will cover six other factors&#13;
influencing bank earnings.&#13;

IV. SIX FACrORS WHCH IMFLUENCE SOURCES OF PROllABIJILlTY&#13;
1. EARNING ASSET GROWTH&#13;
The analysis of earning asset growth includes a look at the trends within the&#13;
structure of earning assets and supporting liabilities.&#13;
The ratio of earning assets to total assets highlights some of the differences between&#13;
banks:&#13;
*  It measures the percentage of total assets which directly contribute interest income.&#13;
A low ratio (or a falling trend) could indicate a high level of bad loans or some&#13;
other non-earning asset such as excess goodwill from acquisitions.&#13;
*  A bank with a low ratio clearly is at an ROA disadvantage compared to a bank with&#13;
a high ratio.&#13;
2. NET INTEREST INCOME&#13;
Net interest income results from interest income minus interest expense.&#13;
Management must attempt to maintain net interest income at an appropriately high&#13;
and steady level in relation to expenses and other income. It is a widely-accepted&#13;
indication of how effectively a bank is managing the relationship of its lending and&#13;
funding activities.&#13;
Net interest income is important because it makes up a substantial portion of Adjusted&#13;
Operating Income (as much as 75-90% at many banks). Net Interest Margin is the&#13;
further extension of net interest income. Slight changes in net interest margin can have&#13;
a substantial effect on ROA and net income growth. It can wipe out the positive effects&#13;
of small changes in earning assets, fee income, expense control, and loan loss&#13;
provision.&#13;
The chart below illustrates the changes in Net Interest Margins of four fictional banks&#13;
during 1981-85, a period of volatile interest rates. It is followed by a brief&#13;
interpretation of the action which the banks may have taken.&#13;

In 1981-83 interest rates fell. In 1984 rates rose. In 1985 rates fell again.&#13;
Bank A shows a steady improvement except for 1984. It reflects a good management&#13;
of Net Interest Margin and may indicate a bank which is operating its business to move&#13;
contrary to the rise and fall of interest rates-consequently its NIM fell in 1984 but rose&#13;
again in 1985. It may have rate sensitive liabilities which exceed rate sensitive assets-&#13;
a common explanation for this situation.&#13;
Bank B displays a decrease through 1984 and a rise in 1985.  Its portfolio was&#13;
managed to move NIM down as rates dropped but continued to decrease when rates&#13;
moved up. An adjustment was made and a slight improvement occurred in 1985 with&#13;
the rate increase.&#13;
Bank C shows a steady 4.0% NIM and most likely is managing itself to achieve a&#13;
balanced condition-this is the exception rather than the rule and is probably difficult to&#13;
achieve.&#13;
Bank D certainly looks like more of a risk taker with its NIM moving in a volatile way.&#13;
It should be carefully examined in that it may be taking above-average risks.&#13;
SUMMARY: A gradual decline in NIM is acceptable if it is accompanied either by an&#13;
offsetting decline in overhead, an offsetting increase in fees, or both. Clearly there are&#13;
tradeoffs in managing a bank.&#13;
3. NON-INTEREST INCOME TO ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME&#13;
Includes recurring income such as fees, trading profits from trading accounts, fees&#13;
and commissions from off balance sheet products such as standby letters of credit,&#13;
loan commitments, and loan sales, etc. It can also include non-recurring events&#13;
such as the sale of a building or taking profits on equity investments.&#13;
Several factors to keep in mind when looking at non-interest income:&#13;
*  The more normal and steady the ratio, the less analysis time is necessary. In&#13;
most banks this figure should be rising, reflecting an emphasis on fee-&#13;
generating products and less reliance on loans (due to more strict credit&#13;
standards or less demand). A very low or very high ratio deserves attention to&#13;
determine management's strategy.&#13;
*  Non-interest income often arises from sources other than bank assets and&#13;
liabilities (trust division fees or merchant banking fees). If it is a high number,&#13;
it can result in a higher ROA than in a bank with low net interest income and&#13;
heavy reliance on Net Interest Margin. Look carefully at trading income for&#13;
large swings.&#13;
* Non-recurring events can cause major swings in this ratio.&#13;

4. OVERHEAD&#13;
Typically the most influential factor on the level and trend of earnings next to NIM.&#13;
Often it can be 50-70% of NIM.&#13;
There are three important measures of overhead and incidentally they are measures of&#13;
productivity:&#13;
1. Overhead to Adjusted Operating Income (AOI). AOI is the income stream&#13;
available to cover expenses, taxes, and dividends, thus the higher the overhead,&#13;
the less available for profits, etc.&#13;
2. Personnel Expense to AOI. Measures the relationship of salaries and benefits&#13;
to Overhead. Normally, the ratio is half-and-half. Differences from this norm&#13;
raise questions regarding the mix of expenses and the relative importance of&#13;
people costs, premises, and systems.&#13;
3. Overhead % Change. Measures the ability to control year-to-year expenses.&#13;
This has received much attention in recent years.&#13;
Another interesting item to observe is amounts of costs and writedowns associated with&#13;
foreclosed real estate (OREO) costs. These expenses are not charged to the loan loss&#13;
reserve since the assets are no longer loans. Instead they are charged as miscellaneous&#13;
expenses and are part of general overhead. A large rise in these expenses can greatly&#13;
influence the overhead ratio.&#13;
5. LOAN LOSS PROVISION&#13;
The ratio utilized to measure this is Loan Loss Provision to AOI. Its normal range&#13;
is 6-8%, but it will increase in times of poor loan quality. It is a discretionary&#13;
number and rarely corresponds to actual loan loss experience. It is depleted by&#13;
gross chargeoffs and replenished by recoveries and input of cash when necessary.&#13;
Two other helpful ratios for measuring loan quality are:&#13;
1. Loan loss provision to net charge-offs.&#13;
2. Loan loss provision to loans.&#13;
6. INCOME TAX PROVISION&#13;
Income tax provision should be fairly standard for banks in most countries. The&#13;
analyst should calculate the marginal tax rate of the bank and check to see if the&#13;
actual rate exceeds it. The marginal rate for many U.S. banks is 46%, and higher if&#13;
there are state taxes as well.&#13;

BANK SOLVENCY AND&#13;
SAFETY-NET MECHANISMS&#13;
In banks which are managed soundly, efforts to operate with solvency and safety net&#13;
mechanisms revolve around a number of topics.&#13;
I. LOAN LOSSES&#13;
For most banks the most critical solvency issue is to protect against loan losses. A wide&#13;
variety of internal and external steps are available to provide this protection:&#13;
* Internal steps. Written credit policies, lending authorities, frequent loan portfolio&#13;
reviews, portfolio management to avoid concentrations, loan review departments,&#13;
auditors, early problem recognition, and credit training all need to be in place.&#13;
* External steps. Examinations from government regulators, outside auditing firms,&#13;
and even outside directors are essential to a soundly managed loan portfolio.&#13;
* Management prudence is vital to the process. "Risk prone managements" are gone&#13;
says Moody's, one of the private rating agencies.&#13;
* In a good performing and well structured loan portfolio, payments should generally&#13;
match deposit maturities.&#13;
* The purchase of credit insurance is being investigated by banks as a another tool for&#13;
reducing vulnerability to loan losses. While banks have not traditionally used credit&#13;
insurance, its availability could be a significant development.&#13;
In terms of loan portfolio management, the ability to sell-off portions of larger credits to&#13;
other banks and the development of the securitization business are two techniques which&#13;
banks are using more frequently. The ability to diversify loan portfolios and reduce&#13;
concentrations is receiving a long overdue emphasis.&#13;

II. FRAUD&#13;
Fraud in its many forms is another major threat to bank solvency. Protection against fraud&#13;
is accomplished in many ways:&#13;
. Policies and procedures which provide dual controls, dual signatures, and&#13;
separation of responsibilities, are vital to this process.&#13;
&#149; Audits by both internal and external auditors provide another element of protection.&#13;
The auditors are most effective when they coordinate with each other and share&#13;
information. The audits also provide a key piece of management information to&#13;
bank executives.&#13;
* The hiring process is an opportunity to spot employees who have the potential for&#13;
fraudulent activities. Background checks and vetting techniques are critical steps in&#13;
fraud avoidance.&#13;
* Personnel policies which require employees to take vacations so as to be away from&#13;
the bank for a period of time are another opportunity to prevent fraud.&#13;
M11. TRADING LOSSES AND LOSSES IN SECURITIES PORTFOLIOS&#13;
In light of recent experience with financial firms such as Barings, and Kidder Peabody,&#13;
much attention is being paid to methodologies which can control trading losses:&#13;
* Policies and procedures which restrict the size of positions which traders can take&#13;
are required.&#13;
* Management information systems, which can help managers oversee traders'&#13;
positions and exposures to various types of instruments, markets, and currencies are&#13;
receiving much more emphasis.&#13;
* In the same manner, the development of policies and procedures for the investment&#13;
side of the bank are essential to managing responsible portfolios. Frequent reviews&#13;
of investment strategies and positions are part of management and outside&#13;
directors' key responsibilities.&#13;

IV. DEPOSIT INSURANCE&#13;
The deposit insurance provided by institutions such as the Federal Deposit Insurance&#13;
Corporation is an important safety net mechanism.&#13;
.  It provides comfort to bank customers knowing that they are protected from&#13;
imprudent actions by bank managements.&#13;
* It serves as a reminder to bankers that they are fiduciaries. They must act prudently&#13;
on behalf of depositors and shareholders. Bankers must be self-regulated as well as&#13;
externally-regulated.&#13;
*  Directors liability and accountability is increasingly important among banks in&#13;
Europe, Japan, the U.S., and Canada. Outside directors in particular, must remain&#13;
independent of bank management in their oversight role. Government regulators&#13;
look to directors to have the interests of depositors as an vital part of their function.&#13;
V. OTHER SAFETY NET MECHANISMS&#13;
* When the need arises, there are a variety of options available to banks to provide raise&#13;
funds. These options are described in detail in the Liquidity and Asset and Liability&#13;
Management Sections of the manual.&#13;
VI. MANAGEMENT ISSUES&#13;
*  There is no substitute for frequent (monthly) reviews of business plans, budgets,&#13;
and policies and procedures. Bank managers and directors should have these&#13;
activities as among their highest fiduciary priorities.&#13;
*  Development of additional safety-net mechanisms such as capital markets efforts to&#13;
sell off loans, or portions of them, to provide liquidity, and back up credit lines&#13;
from other banks to be used only in emergency, is another critical function of bank&#13;
managers.&#13;

SUMMARY - PHILOSOPHY OF&#13;
MANAGING A BANK&#13;
Memorandum from Hugh McCulloch, United States Comptroller of the Currency&#13;
"Let no loans be made that are not secured beyond a reasonable contingency. Do nothing to&#13;
foster and encourage speculation. Give facilities only to legitimate and prudent&#13;
transactions. Make your discounts on as short a time as the business of your customers will&#13;
permit, and insist upon the payment of paper at maturity, no matter whether you need the&#13;
money or not.&#13;
Distribute your loans rather than concentrate them in a few hands. Large loans to a single&#13;
individual or firm, although sometimes proper or necessary, are generally injudicious and&#13;
frequently unsafe. Large borrowers are apt to control the bank, and when this is the relation&#13;
between a bank and its customers, it is not difficult to decide which in the end will suffer.&#13;
Every dollar that a bank loans above its capital and surplus it owes for, and its managers&#13;
are therefore under the strongest obligation to its depositors, as well as to its stockholders,&#13;
to keep its discounts constantly under its control. Treat your customers liberally, bearing in&#13;
mind the fact that the bank prospers as its customers prosper, but never permit them to&#13;
dictate your policy. If you doubt the propriety of an offering, give the bank the benefit of&#13;
doubt and decline it.&#13;
If you have reason to doubt the integrity of a customer, close his account. Never deal with&#13;
a rascal under the impression that you can prevent him from cheating you. The risk in such&#13;
cases is greater than the profit.&#13;
It should be a chief aim of the managers of the banks to make their respective institutions&#13;
strong, not only to keep their capital from being impaired but to gradually create a surplus&#13;
that will be a protection to their capital and to their depositors in the trying times that&#13;
sooner or later happen to all banking institutions. There are few items that have a better&#13;
look upon the balance sheet, and none that is better calculated to give aid and comfort to&#13;
the managers of a bank and to secure for it the confidence of the people, than a large&#13;
surplus                                                                fund.&#13;

Pursue a straight-forward, upright, legitimate banking business. Never be tempted by the&#13;
prospects of large returns to do anything but what may be properly done under the National&#13;
Banking Act.&#13;
'Splendid financiering' is not legitimate banking."&#13;
(This sounds like it could have been written in 1935 or 1995, but was written in 1863.)&#13;
