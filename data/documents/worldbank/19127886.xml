&amp;#12;The first round of Country Status Overviews (CSO1) published in 2006 benchmarked the preparedness of sectors of&#13;
16 countries in Africa to meet the WSS MDGs based on their medium-term spending plans and a set of â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
selected from regional experience. Combined with a process of national stakeholder consultation, this prompted countries&#13;
to ask whether they had those â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; in place and, if not, whether they should put them in place.&#13;
&#13;
The second round of Country Status Overviews (CSO2) has built on both the method and the process developed in&#13;
CSO1. The â&#128;&#152;success factorsâ&#128;&#153; have been supplemented with additional factors drawn from country and regional analysis&#13;
to develop the CSO2 scorecard. Together these reflect the essential steps, functions and results in translating finance&#13;
into services through government systems â&#128;&#147; in line with Paris Principles for aid effectiveness. The data and summary&#13;
assessments have been drawn from local data sources and compared with internationally reported data, and, wherever&#13;
possible, the assessments have been subject to broad-based consultations with lead government agencies and country&#13;
sector stakeholders, including donor institutions.&#13;
&#13;
This second set of 32 Country Status Overviews (CSO2) on water supply and sanitation was commissioned by the African&#13;
Ministersâ&#128;&#153; Council on Water (AMCOW). Development of the CSO2 was led by the World Bank administered Water and&#13;
Sanitation Program (WSP) in collaboration with the African Development Bank (AfDB), the United Nations Childrenâ&#128;&#153;s Fund&#13;
(UNICEF), the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO).&#13;

development, collapsing within a decade. This reflects          resources are restricted to humanitarian aid. Even the&#13;

that of implementer to facilitator; filling key policy gaps     extensive but dilapidated infrastructure. Sector financing&#13;
and amending policies to improve sustainability; assisting      is low in all subsectors. An overall financing strategy needs&#13;
service providers to become financially viable; improving       to be developed which takes into account Zimbabweâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;

There are different sets of sector targets in Zimbabwe.         existing infrastructure in rural and urban areas.&#13;
Estimates of coverage and investment requirements also&#13;
vary considerably. An optimistic scenario for future sector     The Ministry of Water Resources Development and&#13;
development is based on WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring             Management has now assumed leadership for the&#13;
Programme (JMP) figures. In 2008, the JMP suggests that         sector, rejuvenating and extending the mandate of the&#13;

the MDG targets (derived from JMP coverage estimates)           resources should be channeled. Zimbabweâ&#128;&#153;s results in the&#13;
are also lower than the national targets. As a result, the      CSO2 scorecard, which assesses the pathway by which&#13;
coverage increase, and investment, required under this          money is turned into water supply and sanitation services,&#13;

1.	 Introduction&#13;
&#13;
The African Ministers Council on Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round of Country Status&#13;
Overviews (CSOs) to better understand what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation and what they and their&#13;
governments can do to accelerate that progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).1 AMCOW delegated this&#13;
task to the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Water and Sanitation Program and the African Development Bank who are implementing it&#13;
in close partnership with UNICEF and WHO in over 30 countries across Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This CSO2 report has&#13;
been produced in collaboration with the Government of Zimbabwe and other stakeholders during 2009/10.&#13;
&#13;
The analysis aims to help countries assess their own service delivery pathways for turning finance into water supply and&#13;
sanitation services in each of four subsectors: rural and urban water supply, and rural and urban sanitation and hygiene.&#13;
The CSO2 analysis has three main components: a review of past coverage; a costing model to assess the adequacy of&#13;
future investments; and a scorecard which allows diagnosis of particular bottlenecks along the service delivery pathway.&#13;
The CSO2â&#128;&#153;s contribution is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance are sufficient to meet sector&#13;
targets, but what specific issues need to be addressed to ensure finance is effectively turned into accelerated coverage in&#13;
water supply and sanitation. In this spirit, specific priority actions have been identified through consultation. A synthesis&#13;
report, available separately, presents best practice and shared learning to help realize these priority actions.&#13;

In the 20 years from Zimbabweâ&#128;&#153;s Independence in 1980,                         	&#13;
overall water coverage increased from 32 percent to 56                       At Independence in 1980, Zimbabwe inherited a well-&#13;
percent and overall sanitation access from 28 percent to 55                  developed urban sector and a neglected rural sector. The&#13;
percent.2 Urban services had achieved well over 90 percent                   detailed JMP subsectoral figures show limited progress in&#13;
coverage by the late 1990s. Since then there has been a                      drinking water supply over the whole period and a decline in&#13;
decline, the exact extent of which is not known.                             piped supply access (see sections 6 and 9). Despite significant&#13;
                                                                             efforts to develop rural infrastructure, the imbalance between&#13;
The CSO2 compares countriesâ&#128;&#153; own estimates of coverage                       urban and rural services remains a distinctive feature of the&#13;
with data from the UNICEF/WHO Joint Monitoring                               sector in Zimbabwe today:6 98 percent of those without an&#13;

 JMP data shows a flat trajectory in rural sanitation coverage,        costs).19 The model assumes that households contributions&#13;
 despite a vigorous rural sanitation program in the 1980s              will match public finance, that is, the current projected&#13;
 and â&#128;&#153;90s using innovative technologies, a disciplined                 funding of US$14 million per year will leverage the same&#13;
 cadre of environmental health extension workers, and                  amount in household funds. This scenario leaves a CAPEX&#13;
 government subsidies to cover the cost of building materials          deficit of US$62 million per year. However, as discussed later,&#13;
 that could not be sourced on-site. Government estimates               policy on subsidies vs. promotion requires clarification.&#13;
 show a significant decline in rural sanitation coverage.&#13;
 With capital subsidies drying up, few new facilities have             The upstream building blocks of the rural sanitation&#13;
 been built. Meanwhile aging superstructures, full latrine             delivery pathway (policy, planning, and budget) score&#13;
 pits, unavailability (and unaffordability) of cement, have            poorly (Figure 19). The collapse of the earlier program&#13;
 led many rural families to revert to open defecation. The             has meant minimal expenditure, output, and no resources&#13;

 The urban sanitation subsector in Zimbabwe once had                    even assuming a 30 percent contribution by households.&#13;
 one of the highest coverage levels in Africa, including for            OPEX is also well below what is required, ultimately&#13;

 a severe decline in services, reflected in both data sets,             more significant rehabilitation work.&#13;
 though the government estimates of coverage present a&#13;
 far more rapid deterioration. Lack of water flow causes                The urban sanitation and hygiene (USH) scorecard&#13;

            Water supply and sanitation in Zimbabwe :
            turning finance into services for 2015 and beyond
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The African Ministers' Council on
            Water (AMCOW) commissioned the production of a second round
            of Country Status Overviews (CSOs) to better understands
            what underpins progress in water supply and sanitation (WSS)
            and what its member governments can do to accelerate that
            progress across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). AMCOW
            delegated this task to the World Bank's Water and
            Sanitation Program and the African Development Bank who are
            implementing it in close partnership with United Nations
            Children's Fund (UNICEF) and World Health Organization
            (WHO) in over 30 countries across SSA. This second CSO
            report has been produced in collaboration with the
            Government of Zimbabwe and other stakeholders during
            2009-10. The analysis aims to help countries assess their
            own service delivery pathways for turning finance into water
            supply and sanitation services in each of four subsectors:
            rural and urban water supply, and rural and urban sanitation
            and hygiene. The second CSO analysis has three main
            components: a review of past coverage; a costing model to
            assess the adequacy of future investments; and a scorecard
            which allows diagnosis of particular bottlenecks along the
            service delivery pathway. The second CSO's contribution
            is to answer not only whether past trends and future finance
            are sufficient to meet sector targets, but what specific
            issues need to be addressed to ensure finance is effectively
            turned into accelerated coverage in water supply and
            sanitation. In this spirit, specific priority actions have
            been identified through consultation. A synthesis report,
            available separately, presents best practice, and shared
            learning to help realize these priority actions.
