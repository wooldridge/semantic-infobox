role in the Indonesian economy, together accounting for over 85 percent of commercial net&#13;
energy consumption and about 30 percent of the country's export receipts.&#13;
1.2   The principal agency responsible for implementing Government policies in the energy&#13;
sector is the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME), an organizational chart for which is given&#13;
in Annex 1.1. MME coordinates all activities in the energy sector and supervises the state&#13;
enterprises in the sector including PERTAMINA (oil, gas and geothermal), Bukit Asam (coal),&#13;
PGN (gas transmission and distribution) and PLN (electricity). Other ministries and agencies are&#13;
also involved in the sector. The Ministry of Public Works is responsible for hydropower&#13;
resource surveys and the operation of multipurpose hydro plants; the National Atomic Energy&#13;
commission is responsible for nuclear development; and the Ministry of Cooperatives and Small&#13;
Enterprises Development (MOC) is responsible for enhancing the role of cooperatives in rural&#13;
electrification. An inter-ministerial National Energy Board (BAKOREN) coordinates energy&#13;
policies and development with those of other sectors. BAKOREN is supported by a Technical&#13;
Committee (PTE) consisting of senior officials in different departments, chaired by the Director&#13;
General of Electricity and Energy Development (DGEED).&#13;
1.3   Indonesia's basic goals and policies for the future development of the energy sector are&#13;
described in the Outlines of State Policy (Garis-Garis Besar Haulan Negara or GBHN),&#13;
promulgated by the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) in March 1993 to guide the&#13;
formulation of the Sixth Medium-Term (five-year 1994/95-1998/99) Development Plan (Repelita&#13;
VI) and the Second Stage Long-Term (twenty-five year) Development Strategy (PJPT-II). The&#13;
GBHN highlights the importance for Indonesia's sustained economic and social development of&#13;
meeting its rapidly growing energy needs efficiently -- including through conservation and&#13;
diversification of primary energy resources and their more efficient utilization -- and of&#13;
minimizing the adverse environmental and social impacts of energy use. Key government&#13;
policies are outlined briefly below.&#13;
Key Energy Issues&#13;
1.4    Diversification. A central and continuing thrust of the Government's energy strategy&#13;
is to slow the pace of Indonesia's transition to a net oil importer by diversifying domestic energy&#13;
consumption towards alternative and more economic and indigenous energy resources that either&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
have a non-exportable surplus, such as coal and natural gas, or are non-tradeable (hydro,&#13;
geothermal). In the power sector, which is a major user of petroleum fuels, plans call for a&#13;
further reduction of oil's share in power generation from about 50 percent in 1992/93 (about 34&#13;
million barrels of diesel and fuel oil) to about 7 percent by the end of this decade (14 million&#13;
barrels per year). Considerable potential exists for substituting conventional energy supplies and&#13;
especially for meeting the decentralized energy needs of the rural sector by use of economic non-&#13;
conventional and renewable energy supplies, particularly mini-hydro and mini-geothermal power&#13;
schemes, biomass-based power projects (including cogeneration), and solar photovoltaic energy&#13;
systems. The Government has been undertaking several solar pilot projects for demonstration&#13;
purposes.&#13;
1.5    Energy pricing. On the demand side, the Government's policy has been to maintain&#13;
average petroleum product prices at or above international parity (efficiency pricing), while&#13;
cross-subsidizing as necessary the price of kerosene in order to ensure its affordability, with an&#13;
implicit tax on gasoline. Likewise with electricity, while periodic adjustments have generally&#13;
maintained the average retail price close to the long-run marginal cost of supply in Java (para&#13;
2.43), electricity prices have been maintained below economic cost for small residential and&#13;
industrial users who account for about 40 percent of sales. The Government's pricing policy has&#13;
also maintained a uniform price structure for electricity and petroleum products in all parts of&#13;
the country, thereby providing a subsidy to outside Java-Bali and to the rural population.&#13;
1.6    Private sector participation. The private sector operates significant amounts of captive&#13;
power capacity, and is expected to play an increasingly important role in the supply of oil, gas&#13;
and electricity. In oil and gas, Pertamina forms joint ventures with private Production Sharing&#13;
Contractors (PSCs) for exploration and production. Private sector participation is also being&#13;
welcomed in the gas transmission grid Indonesia is developing. In power, 55% (11,600 MW)&#13;
of the additional capacity planned for Indonesia between 1994/95 and 2003/04 (excluding captive&#13;
power) is envisaged to come from independent power producers. Private participation in PLN&#13;
is also envisaged.&#13;
1.7    Envirommental protection.  The Government has established and utilizes uniform&#13;
procedures and guidelines for the preparation and approval of environmental impact analyses&#13;
(AMDAL), for the issuance of environmental clearances, as well as for periodic reporting&#13;
requirements on environmental management and monitoring during project implementation.&#13;
Power Sector Overview&#13;
1.8    At present the sector comprises: the national integrated utility, the State Electricity&#13;
Corporation (PT PLN Persero); captive plants installed by private parties for their own use;&#13;
three Government-sponsored rural electricity cooperatives; and a large number of informal&#13;
micro-enterprises providing electricity to clusters of customers in rural villages not served by&#13;
PLN.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3 -&#13;
1.9    The Electricity Act (Law No. 15 of 1985) defines the legal framework for the electricity&#13;
sector. Under this Act, PLN, established by Government Regulation No. 18/1972, has both the&#13;
right and obligation to supply power in Indonesia. Under Government Regulation No. 23/1994,&#13;
PLN was converted, effective August 1, 1994, from a Perum (a government company) to a&#13;
Persero (a limited liability corporation). The provisions of the Electricity Act are amplified in&#13;
Government Regulation No. 17/1990 for PLN and No. 10/1989 for others. The Electricity Act&#13;
permits establishment of private power producers, distributors and licensees. Presidential Decree&#13;
No. 37/1992 specifically authorizes private sector participation under BOO schemes, and permits&#13;
cooperatives and other legal entities to generate, transmit, and distribute power for public use.&#13;
The electricity subsector is regulated by MME through DGEED. The organization chart of&#13;
MME is shown in Annex 1.1.&#13;
1.10   The power sector has expanded rapidly during the 1980s and 1990s. Electricity sales of&#13;
PLN grew at an average annual rate of 14.3% between 1981/82 and 1993/94, from 7,845 GWh&#13;
to 38,962 GWh. During the same period, the number of customers grew nearly five-fold, from&#13;
3.2 million to about 15.2 million and the number of villages electrified increased eight-fold,&#13;
from 3,400 to over 29,000. In order to meet this growth, PLN's installed capacity increased&#13;
over four-fold from 3,032 MW in 1981/82 to 12,825 MW in 1993/1994. (See Annex 2.2.)&#13;
1.11   In spite of the rapid growth, there is considerable unmet demand at economic prices. In&#13;
1993/94, PLN was able to serve just over one-third of all households (44 percent in urban areas&#13;
and 29 percent in rural areas). By contrast, at least nine-tenths of urban households and two-&#13;
thirds of rural households are estimated to be able to purchase electricity at the economic cost&#13;
of supply. In the industrial sector, PLN accounts for about 87 percent of electricity used by&#13;
industries, with the remainder provided by captive generation plant.'&#13;
B. Key power sector issues&#13;
Sector Vision and Strategy&#13;
1.12   Based on the dialogue between the Bank and the Government of Indonesia (GOI), a&#13;
consensus has emerged regarding the main issues facing the sector and on the fundamental policy&#13;
changes needed for efficient long-run development of the power sector. The Government&#13;
formulated its strategy in a 1994 Policy Statement ("Goals and Policies for the Development of&#13;
the Electricity Power Sub-sector", attached as Annex 1.2), which it is now implementing.&#13;
1.13   Underlying this strategy is a vision of a world-class power sector, which is not only able&#13;
to meet the anticipated rapid growth in demand but which does so at world-class levels of&#13;
performance. The Java-Bali system in particular is well developed, and measures should be&#13;
taken now to approach best practices in the shortest time possible. Closing the "performance&#13;
'Indonesia: Economic Consequences of Power Sector Inadequacy in the Manufacturing Sector, mimeo, World&#13;
Bank, Feb. 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4 -&#13;
gap" between current standards and international best practice is one of the central challenges&#13;
which will face the power sector over the next five to ten years. To meet this challenge, the&#13;
sector is currently moving from monopoly and govermnent domination to a multi-operator,&#13;
mixed-ownership environment. In this period of transition, the power sector is facing four&#13;
critical issues: removing transmission and distribution bottlenecks; improving PLN efficiency&#13;
and power supply reliability and quality; private sector participation; and regulatory reform.&#13;
Transmission and Distribution Bottlenecks&#13;
1.14   As outlined in Chapter 2, Section B, the Java-Bali electricity sub-sector is currently&#13;
characterized by an imbalance between generating assets on the one hand and transmission and&#13;
distribution assets on the other. This has arisen as a result of over-optimistic load forecasts,&#13;
further aggravated by implementation delays in network investments. Correcting this imbalance&#13;
by reducing transmission and distribution bottlenecks so as to enable a rapid growth in sales is&#13;
a central objective of PLN. It has developed a well designed least cost investment program for&#13;
transmission and distribution to use the excess generating capacity.&#13;
PLN Efficiency, Reliability and Customer Service&#13;
1.15   The entry of the private sector notwithstanding, PLN remains by far the dominant player&#13;
in the power sector. While PLN has been steadily improving its operations, its overall&#13;
performance has not yet reached best utility practices; moreover, it lags behind some of its&#13;
regional counterparts in certain regards. Reliability continues to be poor, and PLN has not&#13;
achieved sales growth targets. The underlying causes are rooted in deficiencies in the&#13;
transmission and distribution network and in the consumer service functions. The Government&#13;
indicated in its 1993 policy statement that improving the performance of PLN through&#13;
decentralization, commercialization and corporatization is a priority aim for the sector, and this&#13;
strategy has since been pursued by both the Government and PLN. A key organizational issue&#13;
which is already being addressed is the importance of separating transmission and distribution&#13;
functions - management, operations and finances - from those relating to generation. The latter&#13;
has been separated out on Java-Bali by the creation of two generating subsidiaries (see Chapter&#13;
3). The former functions need to be upgraded in terms of autonomy and responsibility, and the&#13;
distribution management function reoriented to be customer driven. PLN performance is&#13;
analyzed in the next chapter, and PLN restructuring in Chapter 3.&#13;
Private Sector Participation&#13;
1.16   The Government has concluded that private sector participation is a prerequisite for&#13;
reducing its financial burden as well as for increasing the efficiency of electricity production.&#13;
As indicated in earlier paragraphs, the majority of new generating capacity planned is to come&#13;
from the private sector. Major policy, institutional and sector structure changes are needed to&#13;
ensure that this participation -- entry as well as operations -- is based on competition and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5 -&#13;
transparent rules, that the resulting power purchase prices are the lowest possible, and that&#13;
private sector entry into generation is market-driven.&#13;
1.17   Some progress has been made. The Government is taking steps to adopt a competitive&#13;
framework approach for private participation in the power sector. And power purchase prices&#13;
have fallen. The Government recently conducted a competitive bid for IPPs to build, own and&#13;
operate a coal-fired power plant in Cilegon, Java. The resulting agreed price per kWh of energy&#13;
has set a new benchmark which is competitive by international standards and represents a&#13;
substantial improvement over PPAs negotiated earlier.&#13;
1.18   The Government has recently established a Directorate of Private Power under DGEED.&#13;
Using Bank financing, the Directorate is currently undertaking a study into the regulation of&#13;
private power development. During negotiations, it was agreed with the Government that it&#13;
shall, on the basis of this study, prepare draft rules and procedures to govern private sector&#13;
participation in the power sector andfurnish these to the Bank for review and comments by June&#13;
30, 1996, and finalize and enforce such rules and procedures by September 30, 1996.&#13;
Reguhstwy Reform&#13;
1.19   With a significant role assigned to the private sector, and the unbundling of PLN (see&#13;
Chapter 3), the Govermnent has recognized that a new approach to regulation is required. In&#13;
order to identify and define further specific changes needed, the Ministry of Mines and Energy&#13;
is currently undertaking a major review -- with the assistance of consultants financed by the&#13;
Bank -- of the power sector's current regulatory framework, with the aim of formulating and&#13;
implementing a new regulatory regime. The regulatory reform study and the private power&#13;
development study (para. 1.18) are closely linked, and thus synchronizing the timing of their&#13;
implementation is crucial for the sector reform. Therefore, during negotiations it was agreed&#13;
with the Government that it shall, on the basis of this study, prepare draft regulations to govern&#13;
the power sector and furnish these to the Bank for review and comments by June 30, 1996, and&#13;
finalize and enforce such regulations by September 30, 1996.&#13;
1.20   While the introduction of a new regulatory regime would be an achievement in itself,&#13;
international experience indicates that effective implementation can be an even more difficult&#13;
task. The proposed project would provide training and expert support to DGEED for the&#13;
implementation of power sector regulation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2. STATE ELECTRICITY CORPORATION (P.T. PLN (PERSERO))&#13;
2.1   The State Electricity Corporation (P.T. PLN (PERSERO)) is managed by a Board of&#13;
Directors headed by a President Director appointed by the President of the Republic and&#13;
accountable through a Board of Commissioners to the Share-holder Designates, MME and MOF&#13;
(through the Director General for Supervision of State Enterprises). PLN's organizational chart&#13;
is given in Annex 2.1. The organizational structure of PLN, and its ongoing restructuring, are&#13;
the subject of Chapter 3. Briefly, for the Java-Bali system, operational responsibility rests with&#13;
the managers of two newly-created generation subsidiaries, the Java-Bali transmission unit and&#13;
load dispatch center, and four distribution units. PLN's operations outside of Java are divided&#13;
into eleven geographical regions (Wilayahs). PLN Headquarters houses the Directorates of&#13;
Planning, Construction, Operations, Administration and Finance. There are also special support&#13;
units for engineering design, testing and research, training, and management.&#13;
2.2   PLN's managing and operating capabilities have increased over the years along with its&#13;
energy sales. It now connects over one million new consumers annually, a pace un-matched by&#13;
most utilities, and manages a very large investment program (US$ 3 billion annually). Since the&#13;
late-eighties, it has turned around its financial position, moving from losses of Rp 133 billion&#13;
in 1988/89 to profits of Rp 378 billion in 1994, without increases in taniffs above the rate of&#13;
injlation. PLN's historical performance indicators in Annex 2.2 show significant achievements&#13;
in several areas. However, as Table 2.1, which compares PLN's performance with selected&#13;
utilities in the Asian region, suggests, there remains considerable scope for improvement in all&#13;
three areas of PLN's performance appraised below: operations, investment and finances.&#13;
A. Operational Performance&#13;
Transmission and Distribution Losses&#13;
2.3   PLN has brought down transmission and distribution losses from around 18-20% prior&#13;
to and including 1987/88 to 12.2% in 1994. This is a major achievement which has been&#13;
accomplished mainly through a reduction in distribution losses from 15.5 % in 1987/88 to 9.5%&#13;
in 1992/93. In regional terms, PLN's performance with regards to losses places it ahead of&#13;
India, Pakistan and Philippines, but still behind China, Malaysia, Thailand and Korea (5.6%).&#13;
Staff Development and Employee Productivity&#13;
2.4   As of December 31, 1994, PLN had 58,500 employees. PLN has no difficulty in&#13;
recruiting staff educated at levels up to technical high school; however, less than 5 % of the staff&#13;
have university degrees. PLN's Center for Education and Training (PUSDIKLAT) plays an&#13;
important role in upgrading the skills of its technical and administrative staff, and manages ten&#13;

2.5   Employee productivity, as measured by sales per employee and customers per employee,&#13;
has been increasing steadily over time, and in regional terms Indonesia ranks second in these&#13;
indicators behind Korea.&#13;
Bulk Power Operations&#13;
2.6   The operational performance of most of PLN's major plants are good. In terms of both&#13;
the operational availability factor and the forced outage rate, PLN's generating plants compare&#13;
well with similar plants in North America.&#13;
Customer Service and Power Supply Quality&#13;
2.7   A recent survey of Indonesia's industrial establishments on Java revealed that PLN's&#13;
reliability of power supply service leaves room for improvement.' The survey found that the&#13;
average PLN industrial consumer must endure frequent outages (about 15 to 50 outages per&#13;
customer per year, depending on location) resulting in cumulative outage durations from 40 to&#13;
90 hours per customer per year. By contrast, reliability levels in power systems where&#13;
consumers are generally satisfied with service reliability are typically characterized by an outage&#13;
frequency of under five interruptions per consumer per year and cumulative outage duration not&#13;
exceeding 30 minutes to 2 hours per consumer per year. Only 62% of survey respondents were&#13;
satisfied with the reliability of PLN supply.&#13;
2.8   Additional burdens are imposed by power quality problems - distortions in voltage,&#13;
frequency and wave form - as well as the long and uncertain waiting times for new consumer&#13;
connections. The above-mentioned study found that randomly selected data on connection&#13;
records for industrial establishments over the period 1990-93 revealed average connection times&#13;
ranging from 167 days to over three years.&#13;
2.9  Inadequacies in power supply -- shortages, problems with reliability and quality of supply&#13;
and long waiting times for connection -- are one of the driving forces behind the reliance on&#13;
captive power in Indonesia. Approximately 6000 MW of captive generation has been acquired&#13;
by Indonesian companies. On average a firm met 13% of its electricity requirements in 1992 by&#13;
self-generation, with an average capacity factor utilization of only 7 %. This indicates that captive&#13;
power is being used mainly as a backup to compensate for deficiencies in PLN supply reliability&#13;
and quality.&#13;
2.10 The above-mentioned survey conservatively estimated the total cost of low power supply&#13;
reliability and quality to be Rp 340 billion -- $170 million p.a. or 0.8% of manufacturing GDP.&#13;
2.11 PLN will need to focus more on the issues of customer service and power supply&#13;
reliability and quality if it is to improve its sales and level of customer satisfaction. One of the&#13;

key objectives of PLN's decentralization and corporatization is precisely to make it more&#13;
consumer-oriented. Indicators of the number and duration of outages will be monitored over time&#13;
(see para 2.56) and significant improvements expected over the coming years.&#13;
B. Assets and Investment&#13;
Generation&#13;
2.12 The generating plant capacity in Indonesia which is currently owned and operated by&#13;
PLN totaled 14,171 MW at the end of March 1994, of which 10,734 MW is installed in Java.&#13;
The generating capacity comprises a mix of unit types, sizes and fuels. The largest units&#13;
currently operating are the 400 MW generators at Suralaya power station in West Java and&#13;
Paiton in East Java.&#13;
2.13 PLN has traditionally been building very large reserve margins, compared to peak load,&#13;
into its generating capacity. Its 1994/95 Java-Bali reserve margin,2 at 51% is well above the&#13;
internationally accepted best-practice of 25% or less.&#13;
2.14 Annex 2.2 shows the evolution of the Java-Bali reserve margin from 1985/86 to 1994/95,&#13;
and Annex 2.3 shows the projection to 2003/04. The projection is based on the latest generation&#13;
expansion plan for the sector (PLN plus private producers selling to PLN), sales forecast (12.5%&#13;
annual average growth) and load factor forecast (constant at 70%). The time-series shows that&#13;
the reserve margin after falling in the late-eighties has been rising -- largely as a result of over-&#13;
optimistic load forecasts, aggravated by implementation delays in network investments -- in the&#13;
nineties to a high of 65% of 1993/94. However, it is now falling (51% realized for 1994/95,&#13;
40% likely for 1995/96), and is projected to continue to fall towards 25%.&#13;
2.15 There is considerable uncertainty over the projected reserve margin. PLN is adding very&#13;
little of its own capacity in Java-Bali, but instead is relying on the private sector to produce&#13;
additional capacity (see para 2.23). Delays in negotiating the IPP projects have already occurred,&#13;
and further delays would quickly eat into existing excess capacity. On the demand side, the sales&#13;
forecast of 12.5% average annual growth up to 2003 is reasonable, PLN assumes higher growth&#13;
in the earlier years (17% up to 1998/99). If this is not achieved, excess capacity will fall more&#13;
slowly.&#13;
2.16 Although the reserve margin is now falling, the over-expansion of the early nineties&#13;
remains an expensive burden for PLN. During negotiations an understanding was reached with&#13;
GOI and PLN that under the conditions currently facing the power sector in Java-Bali, 25%&#13;
would be the appropriate planning reserve margin for the power system. It was agreed that it&#13;
was a matter of high priority and urgency to bring down the realized reserve margin over time&#13;
2. This figure takes into account PLN capacity plus the capacity of any producers whose power is purchased by&#13;
PLN; it excludes the capacity of captive plants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
and aim to achieve a reserve margin of 30% by December 31, 1999. It was further understood&#13;
that the target of 30% was an intermediate one and that in the later years the reserve margin&#13;
would be further reduced (para. 2.56).&#13;
Transmission and Distribution&#13;
2.17  The islands of lava and Bali are served by an interconnected power system, while on the&#13;
outer islands isolated systems have developed around major load centers, and electricity is&#13;
delivered through minigrids. The backbone of the Java-Bali power system is the about 1,750 km&#13;
long 500 kV extra high voltage (EHV) transmission network, extending from Suralaya at the&#13;
western extremity of Java to Paiton in East Java. The installed generating capacity connected to&#13;
the 500 kV system is about 4650 MW, of which about 1850 MW is located in East Java and the&#13;
rest in West Java. The network in West Java is double circuit construction while the backbone&#13;
lines to Central Java and East Java are single circuits. The 500 kV system transfers power from&#13;
the major generating stations to the load centers. The 150 kV and 70 kV high voltage (HV)&#13;
systems transfer the bulk of the generated power from the 500 kV system, and from generators&#13;
connected at HV to the distribution systems. The 150 kV network comprises about 8,600 km&#13;
overhead line and underground cable throughout Java, Bali and Madura, including a submarine&#13;
cable link to Bali. The 70 kV network in Java, about 4,000 km in length, is systematically being&#13;
upgraded to 150 kV to increase its load carrying capacity. As of June 1994, the installed&#13;
transmission substation capacity in the Java-Bali system (500/150/70/20kV) totaled about 22,600&#13;
MVA. The intert:acing distribution network, operating at 20kV and below, comprises about&#13;
156,600 km medium voltage (MV) and low voltage (LV) circuits and serves about 10.2 million&#13;
consumers.&#13;
2.18  The power transfer capability of the present 500 kV system is constrained because of its&#13;
configuration and the composition, size and geographical location of the generating units&#13;
connected to it. Dynamic stability and security of the whole Java-Bali system depends on the&#13;
single circuit link between West and East Java. System studies indicate that disturbance either&#13;
on the Krian-Ungaran or Ungaran-Bandung Selatan lines will likely lead to system collapse.&#13;
Therefore, for stability reasons power transfer from East to West is restricted to 800 MW during&#13;
peak load conditions, jeopardizing the economic operation of the system. Within the next five&#13;
years about 6000 MW additional generating capacity will be connected to the system of which&#13;
about 3600 MW is in East and Central Java, including the extension of Paiton coal fired power&#13;
plant (2 x 400 MW) with 3x600 MW units. A flexible 500 kV network is planned to be in place&#13;
by year 2000 (Chapter 4). This will ensure economic operation of the whole system, optimum&#13;
use ol the installed generating capacity and system security. The Paiton-Klaten 500 kV line, to&#13;
he linanced under the proposed project, is part of this transmission development plan.&#13;
2.19  The IIV networks are overloaded and also need to be strengthened. There are a number&#13;
of HV transmission and distribution bottlenecks, especially in the supply of power to industrial&#13;
estates near the major cities of Jakarta, Bandung, and Surabaya, and to commercial areas in the&#13;
heart of cities like Jakarta. To relieve these bottlenecks, four actions are required, all of which&#13;
are in process, and all of which the proposed project would support. First, investment in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
transmission and distribution needs to be stepped up, which PLN is doing (see para 2.26).&#13;
Second, the management and planning capabilities and processes in transmission and distribution&#13;
need to be enhanced. This is being done by a process of functional unbundling, which again the&#13;
proposed project would support (as described in Chapters 3 and 4).&#13;
2.20 Third, PLN needs a better information base for its transmission planning to reduce&#13;
problems of geographical mismatch, which can be severe in a rapidly growing economy such&#13;
as Indonesia's, where demand growth is variable and difficult to predict. PLN's transmission&#13;
system planning facilities have already been upgraded under the ongoing Power Transmission&#13;
Project (Loan 3349-IND) with state of art analytical tools and optimization programs&#13;
(PSS/E/TPLAN). The proposed project would support use of a Geographical Information System&#13;
(GIS) as a transmission planning tool to optimize the location of additional transmission&#13;
facilities.&#13;
2.21  Lastly, transmission projects have been particularly susceptible to implementation delays&#13;
due largely to problems with land acquisition and right-of ways. These delays will become more&#13;
costly as PLN has entered into take-or-pay contracts which bind it to pay high capacity charges&#13;
even if it lacks the transmission facilities to evacuate it. PLN is currently reviewing its&#13;
implementation cycle for transmission project, and with the Bank's support has prepared a new&#13;
compensation and resettlement policy framework (para 4.41). Both of these actions should&#13;
mitigate the problem of delay.&#13;
Development Program&#13;
2.22 The potential for future growth in electricity consumption remains high in Indonesia.&#13;
Residential energy sales will increase as the household electrification ratio and incomes rise. The&#13;
growth in industrial consumption is underpinned by the industrial sector GDP growth rate&#13;
projected to be about 10 to 11 % per annum during this decade. PLN's current forecasts imply&#13;
average sales growth of 13.6% per year over 1994-2003.&#13;
2.23 The latest generation expansion program for the power sector -- given in Annex 2.3, and&#13;
including PLN and IPP capacity -- envisages adding to the 1994/95 base of 14,170 MW of&#13;
generating capacity another 8,810 MW over Repelita VI and 12,220 over Repelita VII. Capacity&#13;
in Java-Bali is envisaged to grow from 10,700 MW in 1994/95 by 7,210 MW in Repelita VI and&#13;
8,160 MW in Repelita VII. Capacity outside Java-Bali is envisaged to grow from 3,440 MW in&#13;
1994/95 by another 1,600 MW in Repelita VI and 4,060 MW over Repelita VII. Private power&#13;
is now expected to be dispatched from 1998/99 onwards. It is concentrated on Java-Bali, where&#13;
some 80% of capacity addition in Repelita VII is expected to come from the private sector.&#13;
2.24 As shown in Annex 2.4, PLN's investment program is costed (in 1994 prices) at US&#13;
$19.8 billion in Repelita VI and $18.1 billion in Repelita VII. 49% of this is for generation;&#13;
21 % for transmission; and 30% for distribution. 40% of investment expenditure is allocated for&#13;
outside Java-Bali.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
Balance Between Generation, Transmission and Distribution&#13;
2.25 The coexistence of power supply inadequacies and power shortages with excess&#13;
generating capacity implies an imbalance between generating assets on the one hand and&#13;
transmission and distribution assets on the other. Correcting this imbalance is a central objective&#13;
of PLN's current investment program, which is well-designed to maximize transmission and&#13;
distribution investment so as to fully utilize existing generating capacity.&#13;
2.26 This can be seen in monetary terms by comparing the historic to the projected trend in&#13;
net fixed asset additions. Under the investment period covered by the First Power Transmission&#13;
and Distribution Project (1986/87 to 1993/94), net generating asset additions were valued at&#13;
$716 million p.a. (in 1993/94 prices) and transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) at $390 million&#13;
p.a, giving a ratio of generation to T&amp;D new assets of 1.83. For the investment period covered&#13;
by the proposed project (1996/97 to 1999/00), net generating asset additions (PLN and IPPs) are&#13;
valued at $1,300 million p. a (in 1994 prices) and transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) at $1,400&#13;
million p.a. Thus, comparing the two time periods, T&amp;D asset additions increase by a factor of&#13;
three, and the ratio of generation to T&amp;D new asset additions falls from 1.83 to 1.08.&#13;
2.27 The increased investment focus on transmission is also evident from physical indicators.&#13;
For example, the length of transmission lines in Indonesia increased by 26% over Repelita V,&#13;
but is projected to increase by 80%  over Repelita VI and by 30%  over Repelita VII.&#13;
Transformer capacity is also being rapidly increased. Average peak loading of transformers in&#13;
1994 was 108%; in high load density areas transmission lines and transformers were loaded up&#13;
to 130% of their rated capacity during peak hours. PLN's investment plan will reduce average&#13;
peak loading of transformers to 96% by the end of Repelita VI and to 85% at the end of&#13;
Repelita VII, comparable with best practice.&#13;
C. Financial Performance&#13;
2.28 PLN's financial statements for 1985/86 to 1994 are shown in the financial statements in&#13;
Annex 2.5. (With the change to a Persero on August 1, 1994, PLN's fiscal year changed to&#13;
coincide with the calendar year.) Its financial performance is summarized by the financial&#13;
indicators shown in Table 2.2.&#13;
Profitability&#13;
2.29 During negotiations, it was agreed that PLN shall, and shall cause PLN's Subsidiaries&#13;
to take all measures as shall be required for them to realize an annual rate of return of not less&#13;
than eight percent of the average current value of PLN's and PLN's Subsidiaries' consolidated&#13;
net fixed assets in operation. This covenant is required, at least until a new regulatory regime&#13;
is in place, to safeguard PLN's profitability and ensure sufficient funds are generated by PLN&#13;
to meet its investment requirements. The supplementation of this agreement by covenanted&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
perfornance targets (para. 2.56) should prevent the former from leading to an abuse of the cost-&#13;
plus approach to tariff setting.&#13;
2.30  PLN's overall profitability as reflected in its rate of return on net revalued average&#13;
operating assets (ROR) was negative or only marginally positive until 1989/90 since when it has&#13;
averaged just above 5%. PLN's turn-around in financial performance since the late eighties has&#13;
been achieved while holding the price of electricity roughly constant in real terms. Adjusting for&#13;
inflation (and using the 1995 exchange rate), the average price of electricity fell from 7.6 USc&#13;
per kWh in 1987/88 to 7.3 USc in 1994. Major tariff increases since 1987 -- 25% in April 1989,&#13;
20% in August 1991, 13% in February 1993, 8% in November 1994 -- have more or less kept&#13;
pace with local inflation.&#13;
2.31 Key factors behind PLN's improved financial performance have been the improvements&#13;
in operational performance highlighted earlier, such as reduced losses and improved staff&#13;
productivity. An additional important factor has been the cost and mix of fuels. While the large&#13;
increases in the domestic cost of diesel oil (100% between 1989/90 and 1993/94) had a&#13;
significant negative impact on profits in the early nineties (especially outside Java), the&#13;
corporation's recent increased reliance on more economic gas plants has helped counter this and&#13;
contain the fuel bill.&#13;
Financial Forecasts&#13;
2.32  Part (b) of Table 2.2 gives forecast financial indicators for the period 1995-2003, based&#13;
on the forecast financial statements given in Annex 2.5. 1995 figures are based on the revised&#13;
budget for the current year. Projected figures are based on PLN's latest sales and investment&#13;
forecasts and assume that tariffs increase as required to maintain an 8.0% ROR from 1996&#13;
onwards. (A detailed listing of assumptions is given in Annex 2.6(b).) While the forecasts&#13;
provide an indication of likely trends, it should be noted that they are subject to a considerable&#13;
margin of error, and that this is increasing with time.&#13;
2.33  Most factors point to a favorable financial outlook for PLN: losses are contained and&#13;
slightly reduced; the reserve margin falls over the forecast period; and fuel costs per kWh of&#13;
electricity produced by PLN remain constant in nominal terms at around 50 Rp (due to a&#13;
continued move away from oil to gas and coal). However, the key new factor affecting PLN's&#13;
financial performance is the price and volume of power purchased from private generators.&#13;
Privately-produced power purchases rise from their current level of 0.5% of total power&#13;
produced for PLN sales to 12.4% in 1998 to 29.5% in 1999 to 43.9% in 2003. The expensive&#13;
nature of the initial contracts will put upward pressure on the price of electricity, which is&#13;
forecast to rise in real terms from 7.3 USc per kWh in 1994 to 8.8 USc in 2003. While the&#13;
current price is competitive by regional standards, the forecast price for 2003 would make&#13;
Indonesian power relatively expensive.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
2.34  PLN's fnancial performance has improved this year and, the latest estimate, based on&#13;
unaudited, first-half figures -- and therefore subject to a wide margin of error -- shows PLN is&#13;
forecast to achieve a ROR of 7.1 % for 1995, its highest to date for overall operations. Audited&#13;
figures will only become available in March 1996 at the earliest.&#13;
2.35 The forecast in Table 2.2 shows in most years tariff increases roughly in line with&#13;
inflation (assumed at 6%) are required to obtain the 8% ROR. The Government, consistent with&#13;
its record of maintaining the real value of the electricity tariff, has committed to increasing&#13;
tariffs as required to achieve a 8 % ROR. It is projected that for next year, the increase required&#13;
would be roughly equal to the rate of inflation. Large tariff increases -- 14% and 19%&#13;
respectively -- are, however, forecast to be required in 1998 and 1999, the two years in which&#13;
the first private power projects come on stream. The actual magnitude of these increases will&#13;
depend on the realized entry of private power (see para. 2.15) and sales volume. However,&#13;
serious attention does need to be given now as to how best to smooth the transition towards&#13;
higher average levels of retail tariffs by the entry of private power in 1998. This is already a&#13;
central topic of the Government-Bank dialogue.&#13;
Financing Plan and Capital Structure&#13;
2.36  As mentioned (para. 2.24), PLN is implementing a large investment program of US$38&#13;
billion over Repelita VI and VII. Table 2.3 (based on the financial statements in Annex 2.5)&#13;
forecasts how this program will be financed in Repelita VI, compared with the two earlier&#13;
Repelitas. There are four sources: government and private equity, PLN's internal funds, and&#13;
borrowings.&#13;
2.37 The Government's intention is to reserve its equity contribution to the extent required to&#13;
fmance rural electrification and other projects with social objectives. The precise mode and&#13;
extent of government financing is still to be determined, but it is clear that the proportion of&#13;
investment financed by govermnent contribution will fall dramatically: current forecasts indicate&#13;
a fall from 48% of investment in Repelita V to 19% in Repelita VI (approximately Rp 9.5&#13;
trillion in absolute terms). In addition, about three trillion Rp in private equity contributions is&#13;
projected for Repelita VI, primarily in generation with substantial further increases in private&#13;
equity projected during Repelita VII. Part of this is the capitalization of privatization proceeds,&#13;
part the injection of new equity from private sources in joint ventures envisaged with PLN. As&#13;
a consequence of these evolving and positive shifts in the financing structure, the fiscal impact&#13;
on the Government will be greatly reduced in real terms, notwithstanding the real increase in&#13;
overall sector investment requirements over Repelitas VI and VII.&#13;
2.38 PLN's forecast self-financing ratios average 25% for Repelita VI and are forecast to rise&#13;
further in Repelita VII, an improvement on the averages of 14% and 18% achieved during&#13;
Repelitas IV and V respectively. This increased self-fimancing does not, however, compensate&#13;
entirely for the reduced government funding, making it inevitable that PLN will have to take on&#13;
more debt. In turn this leads to the debt-equity ratio rising over the forecast period. Debt as a&#13;
percentage of debt plus equity (excluding revaluation surplus) is projected to increase over the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

next nine years from its current conservative level of 25-30%  to 50%. The debt-service coverage&#13;
remains satisfactory at 1.5 or above throughout the forecast period.&#13;
2.39 PLN has traditionally been reliant on foreign borrowing, and this is anticipated to&#13;
continue given the limitations of the domestic capital market. However, this leaves the&#13;
corporation exposed to foreign exchange risk, which will rise with the debt-equity ratio.&#13;
recognizing this, PLN has been increasing its local borrowing in recent years, and continues to&#13;
do so, despite the currently high domestic interest rates. PLN made its first domestic bond&#13;
offering in 1992. It made its third and fourth offerings this year and plans to offer Rp 1 billion&#13;
annually from 1996. Recognizing the small size of Indonesia's bond market, PLN is currently&#13;
(and successfully) working to attract interest from Asian investors in its domestic bonds. Any&#13;
increase in private equity will also help PLN reduce its debt dependence and the Govermnent&#13;
its equity contribution.&#13;
2.40 Three existing covenants under previous projects relating to PLN's fnancial forecasts and&#13;
financing plan were agreed to under this project:&#13;
(i)    PLN and PLN's Subsidiaries will not incur any additional debt unless a reasonable&#13;
forecast of their consolidated revenues after expenditures for each year during the term&#13;
of the debt to be incurred shall be at least 1.5 times their projected consolidated debt&#13;
service requirements.&#13;
(ii)    PLN will prepare and review with the Bank and the Borrower its investment plans and&#13;
associated multi-year financial forecasts and financing plans; and,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
(iii) the Government shall ensure that PLN and PLN's Subsidiaries have access to sufficient&#13;
funds to finance capital expenditures for their consolidated investment program pursuant&#13;
to the reviews of the program also agreed to (see para 2.58).&#13;
Liquidity&#13;
2.41  PLN was facing severe liquidity problems from late 1994 until recently. Its current ratio&#13;
fell from 1.3 on July 31, 1994 to 0.76 on December 31, 1994. The inmediate cause for this was&#13;
difficulties with PLNs third bond issue. First scheduled for end-1994, but delayed until early&#13;
1995, it raised only Rp 318 billion out of Rp 1 trillion offered, because the rate offered on the&#13;
bonds -- set by the Ministry of Finance -- was below market levels. In the face of a number of&#13;
large pending liabilities, PLN had to resort to short-term borrowing and defer some of its&#13;
liabilities to the Government. However, PLN's fourth bond issue of September 1995 was more&#13;
successful (oversubscribed by 40%), and the forecasts predict a current ratio of one or above&#13;
for the projection period. Assurances would be obtained to prevent that liquidity problems will&#13;
reappear.  Under the proposed project, it was agreed to include the current ratio as a&#13;
performance indicator, with a minimum target value of one (see para. 2.56).&#13;
Tariffs&#13;
2.42 PLN's most recent tariff schedules, which became effective November 1994, comprise&#13;
24 consumer categories. For medium and large industrial consumers, large commercial&#13;
consumers, large social institutions, and for large office buildings, time-of-day pricing is in&#13;
effect. The November 1994 and earlier tariff schedules are shown in Annex 2.7.&#13;
2.43 The Bank has reviewed PLN's estimates of long run marginal costs (LRMC) for Java-&#13;
Bali that accounts for about 80 percent of PLN sales and for several of the regional grids outside&#13;
Java. PLN's average revenue would be about Rp 190/kWh in Java, if the tariff to each&#13;
consumer category was set at the estimated LRMC of supply in Java. PLN's estimated overall&#13;
average revenue of Rp 162/kWh for Java-Bali (based on actual sales during the period January&#13;
through March 1995 and not including connection fees paid by consumers) is thus close to&#13;
average LRMC of supply in Java. However, cross-subsidies exist between different consumer&#13;
groups. To compensate for subsidies to small consumers, electricity prices to large consumers&#13;
in Java (residential, industrial, and especially commercial) are higher than the economic cost of&#13;
supply. These cross-subsidies are currently under consideration as part of the regulatory and&#13;
private power reviews the Government is engaged in (see paras. 1.18 and 1.19). A gradual&#13;
approach to changing the tariff structure is likely. However, implementation of key elements of&#13;
the sector reform agenda -- commercialization of PLN operations, published bulk power&#13;
purchase and supply tariffs, increased participation of the private sector in electricity supply and&#13;
distribution, and instituting a uniform regulatory framework for PLN and the private sector --&#13;
will ultimately bring about conditions under which the need for substantially reducing cross-&#13;
subsidies will become unavoidable; conditions under which the Government will also find it&#13;
politically easier to allow such changes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
2.44   The Government approved, together with the retail tariff increase in November 1994,&#13;
a Periodic Tariff Adjustment Mechanism. This formula-based mechanism adjusts the average&#13;
tariff every quarter for deviations in price changes (fuel price changes, power purchase price&#13;
changes, local inflation and depreciation against the US dollar) from those forecast by PLN in&#13;
its last annual budget following an increase in the basic tariff. An average of these price changes&#13;
is obtained using the ratio of the annual budgeted expenditure items (fuel, power purchases, local&#13;
and foreign operational costs) to annual budgeted revenues as weights. The mechanism operates&#13;
with a 3-month lag (beginning July 1, 1995 for changes in January-March 1995) and will help&#13;
protect PLN in case there are delays in implementing a basic tariff increase. However, the&#13;
protection is only partial (on account of a number of factors including the weighting system and&#13;
the lag). Simulations show that adjustment of the tariff via the mechanism alone would not allow&#13;
PLN to reach its target ROR over the forecast period, and moreover, would lead to unacceptably&#13;
low debt-service coverage ratios.&#13;
2.45 Under the Second Rural Electrification Project (Loan No. 3845-IND), it was agreed that&#13;
PLN shall: (a) by October 31 every year commencing in 1996 review its long run marginal costs&#13;
with a view to formulating its tariff structure; and (b) discuss the results of such review with the&#13;
Borrower and the Bank; and (c) thereafter, take appropriate steps to revise the tariff structure&#13;
taking into account the views, if any, thereon of the Borrower and the Bank. This covenant was&#13;
also agreed to under this project.&#13;
Taxation&#13;
2.46 With the change in PLN's corporate status from Perum to Persero (see para. 3.2), PLN&#13;
is now a corporation able to pay dividends, though none have been distributed to date, and is&#13;
subject to corporate tax, though payments here are not expected till 2001 due to the use of&#13;
double-declining depreciation for tax purposes. Under Perum status PLN was obliged to set-aside&#13;
55 percent of its annual net profit after corporate income tax for "Dana Pembangunan Semesta"&#13;
(DPS), or the Overall Development Fund, payable in five annual installments commencing two&#13;
years after the year in which the DPS obligation was incurred. PLN's conversion to a Persero&#13;
will not affect the remaining DPS installments due the State Treasury.&#13;
Billing and Collections&#13;
2.47 PLN's bills for the Java-Bali region are computerized and prepared monthly at its Jakarta&#13;
headquarters; for the Outer Islands, bills are prepared at the branch level and printed by the&#13;
regional Finance Divisions. Overall collection performance is generally satisfactory. The&#13;
receivables position of general consumer accounts has been improved from two months in the&#13;
mid-eighties to just over one month (36 days as of June 1995). Receivables from government&#13;
users (including the armed forces and local governments), which account for just over 10 percent&#13;
of PLN's total sales, have been reduced to 48 days (as of June 1995).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
Accounting, Budgeting and Audit&#13;
2.48 PLN's accounting system, recently upgraded through technical assistance provided under&#13;
the Power Sector Efficiency Project (Loan 3097-IND), follows generally accepted accounting&#13;
principles and a standardized set of accounting policies and system procedures. PLN is expected&#13;
to finalize computerization of financial reporting in all PLN regions by end-1996. PLN's internal&#13;
procedures for preparing budgets and monitoring actual expenditures still needs to be&#13;
strengthened through better coordination among and participation by the various functional&#13;
directorates and regional offices.&#13;
2.49 PLN has an effective internal audit group which, in addition to keeping general and&#13;
project accounting matters under review, reports to the President Director for various special&#13;
investigations. PLN's accounts are required by its charter to be audited by Government auditors.&#13;
The audits are carried out following generally accepted accounting practices and standards. In&#13;
the audit reports for 1989/90 through 1993/94 there were no qualifications. As a result of joint&#13;
efforts by PLN and its auditors, the time required for completing PLN's audits has been reduced&#13;
significantly. In recent years, the accounts have generally been finalized within three months&#13;
after the closing of the fiscal year and the audited accounts have been available within four&#13;
months of the close of the fiscal year. The existing audit covenant which requires PLN to submit&#13;
to the Bank its auditedfinancial statements and the report of such audits no later than six months&#13;
after the end of each fiscal year was also agreed to under the proposed project. PLN would also&#13;
continue to furnish to the Bank a copy of its unaudited annual accounts whenever they are sent&#13;
to the auditors.&#13;
Asset Revaluation&#13;
2.50  PLN's assets have been revalued periodically. The last detailed revaluation was done in&#13;
1979 as required of all public corporations under instructions of the Ministry of Finance. The&#13;
revaluation was recorded in the books and was accepted by the Bank. Fixed assets acquired&#13;
after March 31, 1979 are appraised at cost. Following the currency devaluation in September&#13;
1986, the Government issued Regulation No. 45/1986 dated October 2, 1986, providing for the&#13;
revaluation of assets of businesses and public corporations acquired through September 12, 1986.&#13;
The Regulation specifies the annual revaluation factors for the years 1970 to 1986 for adjusting&#13;
the asset values as of January 1, 1987. For purposes of monitoring the proposed revenue&#13;
covenant (para. 2.29) PLN has prepared a revaluation of its assets for 1979/80-1986/87 based&#13;
on the Regulation. A covenant, under the Sumatera and Kalimantan Project (Loan No. 3761-&#13;
IND) that requires PLN to revalue annually its fixed assets (including work in progress and&#13;
consumers' contributions) and accumulated depreciation for the purposes of the rate of return&#13;
calculations under the revenue covenant was also agreed to under the proposed project. The&#13;
method used for annual revaluation since 1986/87 has been reviewed, and an agreed method&#13;
for revaluation is set out in Annex 2.6(b).&#13;
&#13;

D. Performance Monitoring in PLN&#13;
2.51 While the preceding appraisal of PLN's performance shows that PLN has made&#13;
significant progress on a number of fronts, it also indicates there is still some way to go before&#13;
the company can compare itself in all respects with the best in the region, let alone world-wide.&#13;
The Java-Bali system is now well-developed, and there is no reason why its performance&#13;
standards should not now approach best practice, at least regionally. Closing this performance&#13;
gap is one of the central challenges facing PLN over the next five to ten years, and is a key&#13;
development objective of this project.&#13;
2.52 PLN and the Goverrnment have been paying greater attention to performance monitoring&#13;
in recent years. PLN's management now has a contract with the government to which its salaries&#13;
are tied. The contract is based on three sets of indicators: financial, operational and&#13;
administrative. Further, PLN now annually establishes a comprehensive set of operating targets,&#13;
including targets for power supply interruptions, connection time, customer service and&#13;
employee productivity.&#13;
2.53  Internally, PLN Headquarters is also introducing performance contracts for all the&#13;
company's units. These reflect the Government's contract with PLN. For example, the unit&#13;
responsible for distribution in Jakarta has a contract with PLN HQ based on three sets of&#13;
indicators relating to operational efficiency, quality of service and administration.&#13;
2.54 PLN's performance monitoring rests on MISIP (the Management Information System for&#13;
Immediate Improvement). While MISIP provides a fairly comprehensive data base, the accuracy&#13;
of some of its information has been questioned, particularly in relation to power supply&#13;
reliability and connection time. The Bank is currently financing technical assistance to PLN to&#13;
review and improve MISIP.&#13;
Performance Targets&#13;
2.55 Increased commercial pressures and accountability, which are being enhanced through&#13;
the on-going program of corporatization and decentralization, is expected to make the company&#13;
more consumer-oriented (leading to better service) and more cost-conscious (leading to a&#13;
reduction in excess capacity and losses). To monitor actual progress and provide benchmarks&#13;
for performance measurement, the set of indicators included in Table 2.4 will be closely tracked&#13;
over time (see Chapter 4).&#13;
2.56 Specifically, to ensure PLN management attention to improving perfornance, key&#13;
performance targets were agreed on during negotiations. These include the financial targets&#13;
given in the previous sub-section (rate of return, debt service ratio and current ratio), the&#13;
reserve margin indicator (para. 2.16), and operational indicators covering losses and power&#13;
supply reliability (see Table 2.4). During negotiations, performance targets were agreed with&#13;
PLNfor the first two years of the project, and these will be updated annually (always two years&#13;

ahead, starting no later than November 15, 1996). PLN will take all measures to meet the&#13;
agreed performance targets starting 1996, and will report to the Bank on its progress in this&#13;
regard no later than four months after the close of fiscal year. It was also agreed that in the&#13;
event of targets not being reached, remedial action plans subject to review with the Bank, will&#13;
be drawn up. While it was agreed not to include intermediate targets for the reserve mnargin&#13;
indicator, it was also understood that the Bank would review annually the appropriateness of the&#13;
planning reserve margin currently in use in reaching the agreed reserve margin target of 30%&#13;
by December 31, 1999, as well as the realized reserve margin.&#13;
Sectoral Review&#13;
2.57 As noted throughout the preceding analysis, PLN's performance cannot be viewed in&#13;
isolation from the rest of the sector. The entry of the private sector into PLN's grid could give&#13;
rise to a number of problems, including exacerbation of excess capacity, imbalance between&#13;
generation, transmission and distribution, and upward pressure on tariffs due to expensive PPAs.&#13;
2.58 Under the Sumatera and Kalimantan Power Project, agreement was reached with GOI that&#13;
it shall: by December 31 each year commencing in 1995, (i) review with the Bank its power&#13;
sector development program, the least-cost planning analysis used to formulate the said program,&#13;
the roles of PLN and the private sector in the said program, and the transparency and&#13;
appropriateness of the business environment for private sector participation; and (ii) review with&#13;
the Bank PLN's development and investment programs with respect to their consistency with the&#13;
power sector development program, the balance among generation, transmission and distribution&#13;
investments, and the balanced development of regions. During negotiations for the proposed&#13;
project, it was agreed to amend this covenant to emphasize the importance of the power&#13;
generating reserve margin (both planning and realized) in the least cost planning process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
3. PLN RESTRUCTURING&#13;
Restructuring Strategy&#13;
3.1    GOI's strategy for restructuring PLN has two inter-related aspects: decentralization and&#13;
unbundling; and corporatization and private participation. The strategy calls for unbundling of&#13;
PLN organization and management processes along functional lines in Java-Bali (generation,&#13;
transmission and distribution), and decentralization along geographical lines elsewhere. This&#13;
would entail creation of a mix (changing over time) of profit centers, investment units and&#13;
subsidiaries, possibly with private participation, either partially or fully. The various units would&#13;
be given increased autonomy over time in preparation for their creation as subsidiaries. Unit&#13;
managers would be held accountable through performance contracts.&#13;
3.2    As an initial step in the direction of corporatization, the Government converted PLN's&#13;
corporate status from a Perum (a state-owned agency with a social purpose) to a Persero, or&#13;
government corporation, effective August 1, 1994. The end-product of PLN restructuring would&#13;
be a group of limited liability companies, with private participation in their ownership. These&#13;
would compete in a market-oriented environment and be subject to oversight by the regulatory&#13;
regime that is currently under preparation (para. 1.19). The Government would only exercise&#13;
strategic control over PLN on an "arm's length" basis through performance contracts that specify&#13;
clear targets. Under such an arrangement, GOI's financial contributions to PLN would be&#13;
reduced over time to provide only cost recovery for (i) socially mandated activities (such as for&#13;
rural electrification) and (ii) operations for which Government-mandated transfer prices or retail&#13;
tariffs are set too low.&#13;
PLN's Restructuring Plan&#13;
3.3    PLN has prepared a first stage restructuring plan for the Java-Bali system endorsed in&#13;
principle by the Ministry of Finance. Key features of the plan include the creation of three&#13;
generation subsidiaries, as well as the conversion of support service units -- including the&#13;
training center (Pusdiklat/Udlikat), engineering services center (PPE), and management services&#13;
center (PMP) -- into subsidiaries. Other units -- the four Java distribution units, Java-Bali&#13;
transmission and dispatch, construction, and the Testing and Research Center (LMK) -- would&#13;
be retained within the PLN holding company, but would be given greater autonomy and be&#13;
governed by performance contracts.&#13;
3.4   In accordance with this action plan, two generation subsidiaries were legally established&#13;
in October 1995. Each subsidiary has similar capacity (about 4,800 MW) and a balanced mix&#13;
of units. Private participation in these subsidiaries -- through an Initial Public Offering and&#13;
through joint ventures -- is planned from 1997 onwards. The creation of the service center&#13;
subsidiaries is also scheduled for early 1996. A third generation subsidiary will be specialized&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
in geothermal and will be owned jointly by Pertamina and PLN. Further, under Bank financing,&#13;
a consultant is analyzing the most appropriate sequencing of divestiture.  Preliminary&#13;
recommendations of the consultant indicate that distribution should come first in terms of&#13;
divestiture.&#13;
Distribution Restructuring on Java-Bali&#13;
3.5    PLN recognizes the need to improve its customer services. This requires a clear&#13;
separation of distribution from generation and transmission. In contrast to the latter two,&#13;
distribution is fundamentally a customer-oriented business, the primary goals of which should&#13;
be to ensure timely and hassle-free connections for new customers, maintain high power&#13;
reliability and quality standards, and handle customer billing enquiries in an efficient and&#13;
responsive manner. Increased independence for PLN's four distribution units in Java-Bali (East,&#13;
West and Central Java and Jakarta) has been an aim of PLN since 1992 when it drew up a plan&#13;
to provide "semi-autonomous" status to these units by the end of 1994. The distribution units&#13;
now function as cost centers. They are allocated funds at the start of each year to cover their&#13;
operational expenses, and, subject to various centrally-imposed constraints, are expected in&#13;
return to meet a certain level of performance as set out in performance contracts with&#13;
Headquarters.&#13;
3.6    Of the four distribution units in Java, the Jakarta Electricity Distribution Unit (JEDU)&#13;
is the largest and best-run, with 12% of PLN's customers and 28% of sales. Japan-Grant-&#13;
financed consultants have appraised the operations of JEDU, and have prepared an action plan&#13;
by which JEDU would, via a staged process, be given increased responsibilities and authority&#13;
in areas of management, planning and implementation. There are two key milestones for this&#13;
process. The first would be the conversion of JEDU into a profit center, whereby it would have&#13;
responsibility for operating revenue as well as cost management under a performance contract&#13;
with the Holding Company, focusing on profit levels and the operating ratio. The second would&#13;
be a subsequent conversion into an investment center (or "business unit"), which would give&#13;
JEDU additional responsibilities for capital cost management under performance contract&#13;
focusing on the rate of return. After a track record has been established, JEDU would be ready&#13;
for corporatization and divestiture. During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the&#13;
conversion of JEDU into an investment center by December 31, 1997, in accordance with an&#13;
action plan agreed to with the Bank (a draft summary plan is attached as Annex 3.1).&#13;
3.7    The expectation is that the decentralization of management authority to JEDU would&#13;
fundamentally improve its performance; indeed, that it would develop into a world-class&#13;
distribution utility providing reliable power and responsive customer service. To monitor the&#13;
performance of JED U over time, a subset of the performance indicators and targets covenanted&#13;
as set out in para. 2.56 would relate specifically to distribution in Jakarta (such as power&#13;
reliability and quality, and connection waiting times). A draft table of indicators and targets is&#13;
included in Annex 3.2. The performance targets for JEDU and the action plan (para 3.8) will&#13;
be finalized once the relevant consultants' records have been reviewed by PLN, but not later&#13;
than April 1, 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
3.8    The proposed project would provide financing for specialist services identified through&#13;
the preparatory consultancy work as required for the staged development of JEDU.&#13;
3.9   It is envisaged that JEDU would be a pilot for the other three distribution units on Java,&#13;
which would follow a similar process of staged development. The proposed project would&#13;
finance the application of the JEDU pilot to West, Central and East Java Distribution Units.&#13;
Transniission Restructuring on Java-Bali&#13;
3.10   A separate transmission unit and load dispatch center (the Java-Bali Electricity&#13;
Transmission Unit (JABETU or P3B)) was created within PLN at the same time as the&#13;
generation subsidiaries. Unlike JEDU, JABETU is a fledgling organization. However, it will&#13;
soon take on a central role in the power sector, both as transmission investment is increased and&#13;
as multiple generators begin to operate. A staged plan for development has been prepared by&#13;
consultants (financed under the Suralaya Thermal Power Project Loan 3501-IND for JABETU),&#13;
with the same key milestones as for JEDU for transformation into a profit center and&#13;
subsequently to an investment center. Agreement was reached during negotiations on the&#13;
conversion of JABETU into an investment center by December 31, 1997, in accordance with the&#13;
action plan agreed to with the Bank (a draft summary plan is attached as Annex 3.3).&#13;
3.11   The expectation is that the decentralization of management authority to JABETU would&#13;
lead to improved performance in the areas of transmission construction, and operations. To&#13;
monitor the performance of JABETU over time, a subset of the performance indicators and&#13;
targets covenanted as set out in para. 2.56 would relate specifically to transmission on Java-Bali&#13;
(such as transmission losses andfaults, and construction targets). A draft table of indicators and&#13;
targets is included in Annex 3.4. The performance indicators for JABETU and the action plan&#13;
(para. 3.10) will be finalized once the relevant consultants' reports have been reviewed by PLN,&#13;
but not later than April 1, 1996.&#13;
3.12   The proposed project would provide financing for specialist services identified through&#13;
the preparatory consultancy work as required for the staged development of JABETU.&#13;
Restructuring Outside Java-Bali&#13;
3.13   The long-run development of the power sector outside Java-Bali requires the progressive&#13;
replacement of the large number of high cost isolated diesel generating units currently operating&#13;
by interconnected regional grids supplied by more efficient generating plants or where&#13;
appropriate by decentralized renewable energy sources that are cost effective. Even though the&#13;
private sector is expected to play an increasingly important role, and there is scope for&#13;
harnessing captive power capacity not currently connected to PLN's grids as well as renewable&#13;
energy generation by the private sector, PLN will continue to play a dominant role in the supply&#13;
of electricity outside Java.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
3.14   PLN is currently decentralizing outside as well as on Java. Given the less developed&#13;
nature of the systems outside Java, the decentralization is appropriately taking the form of&#13;
geographical (vertical) rather then funtional (horizontal) unbundling. The aim is to devolve&#13;
powers to the existing Wilayahs, and, in due course, corporatize them. Using Bank financing,&#13;
consultants are currently preparing action plans along these lines for two, relatively-advanced,&#13;
pilot Wilayahs (IV -- South Sumatera -- and VI -- South Kalimantan).&#13;
Financial Aspects of Restructuring&#13;
3.15   The recent creation of generation subsidiaries, and the planned unbundling of&#13;
transmission and distribution clearly have major financial implications for PLN. Over the last&#13;
few years, PLN has been developing financial statements for generation and transmission&#13;
(combined) and for distribution. These require further development; in particular, the separation&#13;
of transmission from generation needs to be accounted for. The accounts of the various&#13;
subsidiaries will be consolidated in the PLN holding for purposes of regulation (e.g., for the&#13;
automatic tariff adjustment mechanism) and for legal covenants (e.g., the rate of return and debt&#13;
service coverage covenants with the Bank). New arrangements will have to be made at the time&#13;
of divestiture. PLN has a number of major outstanding liabilities, which will need to be&#13;
allocated in the course of unbundling. Chief among these are its long-term debts, and the take-&#13;
or-pay power purchase agreements it has entered into. PLN Holding will of course continue to&#13;
be bound by its earlier contractual obligations, but will wish to pass on at least some of these&#13;
obligations to its subsidiaries. While these financial questions are currently under study, it is&#13;
likely that PLN Holding will continue in the role of a single power purchaser.&#13;

4. THE PROJECT&#13;
Objectives&#13;
4.1   The objective of the project is to improve customer service by: (a) increasing the physical&#13;
capacity, efficiency and reliability of the Java-Bali transmission system and distribution network; (b)&#13;
promoting sector efficiency, competition and private sector participation by implementing functional&#13;
decentralization (unbundling) of PLN operations in Java-Bali and developing effective regulatory&#13;
oversight and institutions.&#13;
4.2.   The effectiveness of the project will be measured by several important indicators that measure&#13;
improvements in customer service, including the frequency and duration of power supply outages. The&#13;
key customer service performance indicators and targets that will be used to monitor the progress in&#13;
achieving the project development objectives are shown in Table 2.4.&#13;

implementation of the new power sector regulatory regime.&#13;
Investment Components&#13;
4.4   Expansion of the EHV and HV netw ork by PLN is based on the recommendations of the&#13;
Java-Bali transmission system long term development study, completed in 1994 under the Bank&#13;
financed Power Transmission Project (Loan 3349-IND). This study provided a master plan for&#13;
establishing an efficient and least cost transmission system for supplying the demand up to&#13;
2003/2004. For defining the target network, the study evaluated several alternative network&#13;
configurations for meeting the requirements of load and generation in the horizon year and&#13;
selected the least cost option. The target network is implemented in year by year steps;&#13;
optimizing transmission expansion to match the commnitted and planned generation expansion and&#13;
the growth in consumption. The 500 kV and 150 kV transmission lines and substations financed&#13;
under the proposed project are part of PLN's least cost transmission development plan for 1998 and&#13;
1999.&#13;
4.5   500 kV transmission facilities. The main guidelines driving the EHV system development in&#13;
the next five years are the need to (i) accommodate the planned new generating capacity which will be&#13;
connected at 500 kV, (ii) reinforce all sections of single circuit 500 kV lines in order to increase&#13;
transfer capability and enhance security of the Java-Bali system; and (iii) provide a more flexible&#13;
configuration which can accommodate the diverse demand growth while allowing secure and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
economic operation of the system. Within the next five years about 6000 MW generating capacity&#13;
will be added to the 500 kV system and the peak power transfer is expected to increase to about&#13;
7600 MW by 1998 (58% of system peak) compared to 4300 MW in 1995. The 415 km long&#13;
double circuit transmission line from Paiton to Klaten is a strategic link in the 500 kV network&#13;
development. Construction of this line is the first step towards establishing a 500 kV loop which&#13;
will interconnect all regions in Java and facilitate economic operation of the whole system. In&#13;
addition to increasing the security and supply capability of the 500 kV system, the line will also&#13;
provide the transmission capacity required to evacuate the ultimate 4000 MW output of Paiton&#13;
power development. The commissioning of Paiton I Private Power Project, the first 2x600 MW&#13;
extension to the existing 800 MW plant, is scheduled for September 1998.&#13;
4.6   Map No. IBRD 27588 illustrates the development of the 500 kV transmission system up to&#13;
1999/2000. Reinforcement of the single circuit sections from Cibinong to Saguling, Bandung Selatan&#13;
to Ungaran, and Ungaran to Krian is currently being implemented under an ADB-financed transmission&#13;
project. Completion of the second circuit through the northem part of Java is expected by June 1996.&#13;
To supply the rapidly growing load in the southern region of Central Java, PLN has committed the&#13;
construction of a 500 kV substation at New Klaten and a 500 kV single circuit line from Ungaran to&#13;
Klaten. The project is financed by KfW and is expected to be commissioned in 1997. The double&#13;
circuit transmission line from Paiton to Klaten via Kediri substation, financed under the proposed Bank&#13;
loan, is scheduled to be in operation by the time of the commissioning of Paiton I Private Power&#13;
Project in September 1998. Extension of the EHV backbone from Klaten to Tasikmalaya in West Java&#13;
is proposed to be implemented by OECF. Detailed scope and cost estimates for the Paiton-Klaten&#13;
transmission project are given in Annex 4.1(a).&#13;
4.7   150 kV transmission facilities. PLN's 150 kV network in Jakarta and Central Java needs to&#13;
be strengthened in the face of bottlenecks and rapidly growing demand (para 2.19). The 150 kV&#13;
component would finance the construction of three new substations and of about 60 km of overhead&#13;
transmission lines in Jakarta and West Java and the extension of 4 existing 150 kV substations in&#13;
Central Java; required for commnissioning in 1999. A detailed project costing is given in Annex 4.1 (b).&#13;
4.8    Distribution facilities. During Repelita VI about 7.6 million new consumers will be served by&#13;
PLN. in Java and Bali. The distribution component of the proposed project will finance the&#13;
requirements for expanding the non-rural distribution in Java-Bali and connecting about 420,000&#13;
consumers in 1997. This is about one-sixth of the distribution investment program in Java-Bali for that&#13;
year. The corresponding targets of physical construction are (a) 2,181 kmc of MV lines; (b) 1645&#13;
kmc of LV lines; (c) 235 MVA distribution transformer capacity; and (d) 418,645 consumer&#13;
connections. Annex 4.1(c) gives details of the physical quantities subdivided into PLN's regions in&#13;
Java, and the cost estimates.&#13;
Technical Assistance&#13;
4.9   The emerging commercialized units of PLN in Java will have to meet the expectations of its&#13;
stakeholders including the Government, the holding company P.T. PLN, customers, employees,&#13;
lenders and private companies with whom these units will be engaged in transacting business, as well&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
as potential future investors. Mere year-to-year incremental improvements in efficiency, performance&#13;
and business practices from previous levels achieved will not suffice any longer. Rather, stakeholder&#13;
expectations in Java-Bali are increasingly based on PLN meeting efficiency and service delivery&#13;
standards that are in line with other efficient providers of such services - for example PLN's regional&#13;
peers - or in certain cases in line with standards defined by international best practice.&#13;
4.10   Meeting these expectations will require a fundamental turn around in the corporate culture and&#13;
management approach - a process that is underway - as well as quickly closing the performance gap in&#13;
Java-Bali, in terms of operating efficiency and service delivery. Such changes will need to be&#13;
underpinned by a mrjor effort to strengthen management, financial and operating systems and human&#13;
resources, and to put in place an information system to allow monitoring of critical performance&#13;
indicators. The technical assistance components under the proposed project, and described below,&#13;
have been designed to facilitate such changes in PLN's transmission, distribution and support service&#13;
units.&#13;
4.11  Draft Terms of Reference for all but one of the technical assistance components have been&#13;
prepared and are contained in the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) document (para 4.34). The&#13;
TOR for the initial implementation support for the Office of the Regulator are currently under&#13;
preparation by the consultants.&#13;
Project Engineering&#13;
4.12 Design, Engineering and Construction Supervision for Transmission Investments.&#13;
Engineering design and preparation of bidding documents for the 500 kV and 150 kV&#13;
transmission components financed under the proposed loan will be carried out by PPE, the&#13;
engineering services unit of PLN. For detailed design, project management and construction&#13;
supervision of the transmission projects however, PLN will require the services of engineering&#13;
consultants.  Since PPE is operating as a commercial unit, the cost estimates for project&#13;
engineering includes for their services, which would be self financed by PLN.&#13;
4.13 Design and Engineering for Distribution Investments. Engineering design and&#13;
preparation of bidding documents for distribution materials and equipment, financed under the&#13;
proposed loan, will be provided by PPE, and self financed by PLN.&#13;
Efficiency Improvement&#13;
4.14 Geographical Information System (GIS). PLN's operational GIS, implemented for rural&#13;
electrification planning under the Bank financed RE I project (Loan 31 80-IND), provides geographical&#13;
and statistical data for inter alia potential power generation sites, regional boundaries, natural obstacles,&#13;
infrastructure, general statistics on population, existing and planned EHV/HV and HV/MV substations,&#13;
location and characteristics ot about 2,700 PLN power plants, electrification status by desa, and&#13;
electricity consumption density. Under the proposed technical assistance the capability of the GIS&#13;
software and hardware would be expanded to enable to: (a) provide data on existing and planned EHV&#13;
and HV transmission facilities and distribution facilities (b) interface with existing PLN load forecast&#13;
models to create a macro planning tool for transrnission and distribution expansion, and (c) use load&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31 -&#13;
forecast models for and provide mapping of urban centers. The enhanced GIS will improve PLN's&#13;
transmission and distribution planning capability and management of these projects.&#13;
4.15   Suralaya Steam Power Plant Simulator. The plant simulator in PLN's training center is&#13;
based on the first 400 MW unit of Suralaya thermal power plant, commissioned in 1984. The&#13;
development in power plant control technology in the past ten years and the higher level training&#13;
requirements for modem steam power plants like Suralaya units 5, 6 and 7, and Paiton necessitate the&#13;
upgrading of training facilities for operators and supervisors. The consulting services proposed under&#13;
this project would assist PLN to: (a) design and implement a state-of-the-art steam power plant&#13;
simulator suitable for all existing and future generating units at Suralaya, and (b) develop and&#13;
implement an appropriate training program for PLN instructors and staff, taking into account current&#13;
and future operational needs. The new facilities will enhance the efficiency of PLN's education and&#13;
training unit (PusdiklatlUdiklat), and therefore the prospects for conversion into a subsidiary in the near&#13;
future (para 3.3).&#13;
PLN Restructuring&#13;
4.16   Java-Bali Electricity Transmission Unit (JABETU).  Creation of an independent&#13;
transmission company is a key element of the sector reform (see Chapter 3). Through the first phase of&#13;
restructuring, PLN Holding will most likely remain the central power purchaser and responsible for&#13;
despatch and generation planning. The role of the new transmission company would be the efficient&#13;
transportation of electricity in the Java-BaG system. JABETU would operate and maintain PLN's&#13;
existing transmission facilities and invest in new facilities to provide adequate transmission capacity to&#13;
the power purchaser and operate metering at the grid supply points and generation connection points.&#13;
Management consultants financed under the Suralaya Thermal Power Project (Loan 3501-IND)&#13;
identified the minimum organizational and functional structures and procedures required to establsh a&#13;
transmission unit within PLN and prepared an action plan for the staged development of JABETU to&#13;
an investment center (business unit ). For allowing JABETU to operate with increasing autonomy in a&#13;
decentralized fashion while accountable for its performance through key targets would require&#13;
technical assistance in the areas of management systems, operations, finance and budgeting, planning,&#13;
efficiency and productivity improvements, development of a Grid Code, etc. The technical assistance&#13;
under the proposed project would finance the minimum systems, structures and procedures required to&#13;
enable JABETU to operate as an autonomous unit.&#13;
4.17   Jakarta Electricity Distribution Unit (JEDU).  A major focus of this project is the&#13;
transformation of the present Jakarta Electricity Distribution System into an autonomous Jakarta&#13;
Electricity Distribution Unit (JEDU), which would be comparable with world class utilities in efficiency&#13;
and service quality (Chapter 3). Management consultants, financed under Japanese PHRD grant,&#13;
prepared an action plan for the phased development of JEDU from cost center to investment center&#13;
and identified specific technical assistance needs in the areas of management systems, operations,&#13;
finance and budgeting, planning, marketing and development of human resources. The operation and&#13;
efficiency improvement measures recommended for implementation by the consultants are based on&#13;
and incorporate earlier plans for a Distribution Management Program developed under the Power&#13;
Sector Efficiency Project (Loan 3097-IND).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
4.18  West Java, Central Java, and East Java Distribution Units. Mainstreaming and applying&#13;
the lessons learned from the JEDU pilot to create three additional independent distribution units in Java&#13;
is the focus of this TA As preparation for the establishment and implementation of autonomous units&#13;
in these regions, PLN will use technical assistance to evaluate each operation and adapt the JEDU&#13;
model to apply to each one. Development of action plans and the preparations for implenenting those&#13;
plans will be financed under this project.&#13;
MME Component&#13;
4.19 Regulatory Framework Implementation. The Government is committed to implemenfing&#13;
the regulation and oversight required in the emerging multi-operator and more competitive sector&#13;
environment with the objective of increasing sector efficiency and improving customer service. Two&#13;
consultancies - financed under Bank TA -- are underway in the Directorate General for Electricity and&#13;
Energy Development (DGEED) to design the requisite regulatory framework and draft the&#13;
corresponding regulations. The Office of the Regulator, which is located in DGEED, will require&#13;
support in implementing the said regulations and the related administrative processes as well as training&#13;
of its staff to perform the supporting tasks.&#13;
Project Cost&#13;
4.20  The estimated project cost, exclusive of duties and taxes but including physical and price&#13;
contingencies, is US$648.6 million equivalent. The total financing requirement, including taxes and&#13;
interest during construction (IDC), amounts to about US$826.5 million equivalent. This is made up of&#13;
US$610.2 million in foreign exchange and US$216.3 million in local finds and is calculated on the&#13;
assumption that PLN and GOI self-finance their contributions to the project. Cost estimnates by major&#13;
project components are sumnmzed in Table 4.1. Cost estimates are in June 1995 prices and use an&#13;
exchange rate of Rp2246 per US$. Price contingencies for foreign costs are assumed at 2.6 percent&#13;
per year during the project implementation period, and for local costs at 6.0 percent per year. Physical&#13;
contingencies are amounting to about 7 percent for transmission lines, 5 percent for substations, and 10&#13;
percent for land acquisition and compensation.&#13;

Financing Plan&#13;
4.21   A financing plan is presented in Table 4.2. A proposed Bank loan of US$373.0 million&#13;
equivalent to the Republic of Indonesia would finance 100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of&#13;
investment exclusive of interest during construction and taxes, and 100 percent of all contracted&#13;
technical assistance. US$2.0 million equivalent would be made available to MME and the balance of&#13;
US$371.0 million equivalent would be onlent to PLN. Agreement was reached with GOI during&#13;
negotiations for the proposed project that the GOI will onlend the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan,&#13;
except for the US$2.0 million eqivalent for technical assistance to the Ministry of Mines and Energy, to&#13;
PLN under a subsidiary loan agreement with a 20 year term including five years grace period. The&#13;
subsidiary loan will be denominated in the foreign currency withdrawn and the onlending interest rate&#13;
will be equal to the Bank's standard variable inteest rate plus 0.5 percent per annum. In addition, PLN&#13;
will pay to GOI a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum or at such other percentage rate as&#13;
the Government shall pay to the Bank on the undisbursed amnount of the Subsidiary Loan from time to&#13;
time. The foreign exchange risk wull be bome by PLN. Execution of a subsidiary loan agreement&#13;
between GOI and PLN, satisfactory to the Bank, will be a condition of effectiveness of the loan.&#13;
Agreernent was also reached that the Governnent would ensure PLN has access to the necessary local&#13;
finds to complete the project.&#13;

4.22 Several bilateral and international lending agencies are expected to be involved in&#13;
financing the transmission investments in Indonesia. GOI is arranging financing for PLN's&#13;
investment program for transmission and distribution facilities during 1997 to 1999.  The&#13;
proposed project is part of that program and accounts for about one-tenth of the related financing&#13;
requirements.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
4.23   Procurement arrangements for the proposed project are summarized in Table 4.3. The 500 kV&#13;
and 150 kV transmission lines and substations will be procured under supply and installation contracts,&#13;
which will be bid through international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank's&#13;
procurement guidelines and using the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents (SBD). The Bank will&#13;
finance the cost of all materials and equipment, including telecommunication equipment for the&#13;
transmission lines and substations under these contracts. Provision will be made for payment of a&#13;
bonus for the contracts which are on the critical path and are likely to secure benefits to PLN from&#13;
early completion.&#13;
4.24  For distribution, the Bank would finance procurement of equipment and materials for&#13;
customer connections, distribution transformers, and MV and LV distribution lines through ICB&#13;
procedures in accordance with Bank's procurement guidelines and using the Bank's Standard Bidding&#13;
Documents.&#13;
4.25   Equipment and material for the power plant simulator upgrade will be procured under ICB&#13;
procedures.&#13;
4.26   Consultants for all technical assistance financed under he proposed Bank loan will be selected&#13;
and engaged in accordance with the Bank's guidelines for the Use of Consultants, and using the Bank's&#13;
Standard Form of Contract for Consultant's Services. The summary description of expected TA&#13;
contracts, their estimated value and person month requirement is presented in Table 4.4.&#13;
4.27   Qualifying local manufacturers competing for the supply of goods under ICB procedures&#13;
would be eligible for a preference in bid evaluation of 15 percent or the import duty, whichever is&#13;
lower. In the case of the supply and installation contracts, the preference margin for local suppliers&#13;
shall not apply to the whole package, but only to the locally-manufactured equipment within the&#13;
package.&#13;
4.28 All supply and installation bid packages will be reviewed by the Bank. Bid packages for&#13;
material and equipment for the distribution component and for the plant simulator to be financed by the&#13;
Bank loan estimated to cost over US$ 200,000 equivalent (over 90% of the procurement volume)&#13;
would be subject to the Bank's prior review. Al consulting services provided by firms above $100,000&#13;
equivalent and above US$50,000 equivalent to be provided by individuals would also be subject to the&#13;
Bank's prior review (over 90%/o of the procurement volume). The contract packaging for the&#13;
transmission and distribution components is given in Annex 4.2.&#13;

Disbursement&#13;
4.29   The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed against approved contracts and is estimated to the&#13;
following amounts of each category: (a) 100 percent of C.I.F. for directly imported equipment and&#13;
materials; (b) 100 percent of ex-factory expenditures for locally assembled equipment and material; (c)&#13;
65 percent of local expenditures for other items procured locally; (d) 100 percent of all contracted&#13;
consulting services expenditures. Table 4.5 shows the agreed allocation of loan proceeds to finance&#13;
expenditures under each category. No disbursements will be made for expenditures prior to loan&#13;
signing. During negotiations it was agreed that the minimum withdrawal applications for this project&#13;
will be US$500,000. Withdrawal applications would be fully documented for all expenditures against&#13;
which loan disbursements would be made, except for materials and equipment valued at less than&#13;
US$200,000, and consulting firm contracts valued at less than US$ 100,000 for firms and US$ 50,000&#13;
for individuals and training that would be disbursed on the basis of statements of expenditures (SOE).&#13;
Documents supporting the SOEs would be retained by respective project implementing agencies and&#13;
would be made available for review as requested by Bank missions.&#13;

(SOE). Documents supporting the SOEs would be retained by respective project implementing&#13;
agencies and would be made available for review as requested by Bank rnissions.&#13;
4.30. Loan disbursement agains expenditures for the 500 kV and 150 kV transmission components&#13;
will be subject to PLN furnishing to the Bank a 500 kV RAP and 150 kV RAP, satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank, based on the agreed PLN's general policy for the establishment of overhead transmission lines&#13;
(paras 4.42 and 4.43).&#13;
4.31   The estimated disbursement schedule for the proposed Bank loan is shown in Annex 4.3.&#13;
Disbursements are expected to be faster than the Bank profile for power projects in Indonesia because&#13;
of the absence of a generation component, which would have a longer run-up time, and because nearly&#13;
all of the investment component is due for completion by end-1998, only three years after expected&#13;
Board approval.&#13;
lmplementation&#13;
4.32  PLN and MME would be responsible for implementation of their respective components. For&#13;
the transmission and distribution components, PLN's Engineering Services Center (PPE) will handle&#13;
the design and preparation of bidding documents; procurement will be handled by a central&#13;
procurement unit; and construction, including survey, land acquisition and compensation, will be&#13;
managed by the transmission project construction units in West, Central and East Java. The manager&#13;
of the central Transmission Construction Supervision Division will be responsible for coordinating and&#13;
monitoring the implementation of the subprojects and providing progress reports to the Bank.&#13;
Consultants will assist PLN in the detailed design and supervision of the transmission construction&#13;
(para 4.12).&#13;
4.33 The GIS project will be managed by the System Planning Division in PLN Headquarters, while&#13;
the upgrading of the plant simulator and training of instructors will be the responsibility of PLN's&#13;
Education and Training Center (PUSDIKLAT). Establishment of the distribution and transmission&#13;
units, and their development into profit and then investment centers (see Chapter 3) will be the joint&#13;
responsibility of a Steering Committee, comprising the PLN Board of Directors, and the manager of&#13;
the respective units. The technical assistance aimed at supporting the development of the units would&#13;
be be managed by the respective units and implemented by task teams. Within MIME, the Directorates&#13;
of Private Power and of Regulation (to be established within DGEED), would implernent the technical&#13;
assistance on regulatory framework.&#13;
4.34  PLN has prepared a Project Implementation Plan (PIP) which was appraised by the Bank and&#13;
found satisfactory. This document is part of the project file. The PIP contains the following principal&#13;
elements for each component of the project: scope and objectives, detailed project description,&#13;
organizational arrangements, project management structure, time bound implementation plan including&#13;
procurement schedule, milestones and performance indicators, and TORs for the technical assistance&#13;
components.&#13;
4.35   The project management and implementation schedule with allocated responsibilities is&#13;
presented in Annex 4.4. It shows key activities and timing by total project and subcomponent.&#13;

Monitoring and Supervision&#13;
4.35.  Procedurts foi iiioutorins th} physicil p ogre.;s of the p-o)ject and iinancial repotiing has been&#13;
discussed with PLN. Key monitorable indicators of project impiementatio l and iroject perforiance&#13;
are given by the schedules of project implementation (Annex 4.4), PLN would be required to submit to&#13;
the Bank monthly and quarterly progress reports which would form the basis of monitoring the&#13;
procurement and construction of the transmission and distribution components and execution of the&#13;
technical assistance components against the time bound implementation schedules. Such progress&#13;
reports would be sent to the Bank within ten days after conclusion of each calendar month. After&#13;
procurement activities completed, quarterly reports would be submitted.&#13;
4.37   The project supervision arrangements are described in Annex 4.5. During the first two years of&#13;
project operation, two supervision missions are scheduled each year; subsequently; one supervision&#13;
mission per year is allotted. Supervision will focus on (a) review of PLN's power development&#13;
program and investment plan, (b) financial covenants and financial indicators, (c) progress with PLN&#13;
restructuring, (d) progress with the implementation of the new regulatory regime, (e) implementation&#13;
issues including implementation of the RAPs, (f) technical supervision of implementation of project&#13;
components. Supervision will require expertise in power engineering, institutional development,&#13;
organizational and commercial issues, project management and econornic and financial analysis and&#13;
resettlement specialists. Staff input is budgeted for about 45 staff-weeks to the end of the project.&#13;
Project Performance Monitoring Indicators&#13;
4.38   A monitoring and evaluation scheme will be established for periodically assessing the progress&#13;
of implementation of the project in terrns of attainment of objectives. Key project performance&#13;
indicators that would be used for monitoring progress will include the following subsets:&#13;
(a) Impact Indicators: These key performance indicators will be directly linked to the project&#13;
development objective and will track whether or not these developmental objectives have been&#13;
met.&#13;
(b) nput and Process Indicators will track the planned investment and relate to specific&#13;
actions such as procurement, disbursement, contracted technical assistance, and management.&#13;
(c) Output and Outcome Indicators will track the results of physical investment and technical&#13;
assistance.&#13;
4.39   Key performance indicators for the project components will be finalized and agreed upon with&#13;
PLN once the relevant consultants' reports are completed and reviewed by PLN and the Bank, but not&#13;
later than April 1, 1996.&#13;
Environment and Resettlement&#13;
4.40 PLN's General Policy Concerning the Establishment of Overhead Transmission Lines.&#13;
By the end of the decade PLN will need to double the HV and EHV transmission network throughout&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
Indonesia and increase the length of MV distribution lines threefold to ensure efficient and reliable&#13;
power supply to its consumers. To meet this formidable challenge, PLN has been reviewing its&#13;
approach to acquisition of land, houses and other structures and compensation and rehabilitation of&#13;
project affected people (PAPs) due to power transmission and distribution projects. A major objective&#13;
of PLN's new policy is to minimize adverse effects to people and to ensure that PAPs are compensated&#13;
and rehabilitated so as to enhance, or at least restore their pre-project standard of living. The new&#13;
policy will also reduce implementation delays caused by protracted and often unsuccessful price&#13;
negotiations with land owners and affected people. The increasing public interest in the negative&#13;
environmental impacts of transmission lines has also signaled the need to PLN to focus on public&#13;
information and consultation.&#13;
4.41 With the Bank's support, PLN prepared a new policy framework for land acquisition,&#13;
compensation and resettlement for all its transmission projects. The new policy framework provides&#13;
eligibility criteria for determining compensation to be provided to PAPs to be affected, and&#13;
compensation, resettlement and rehabilitation measures to be provided to PAPs to be resettled. It also&#13;
includes provisions relating to: (a) valuation and compensation of assets at their replacement cost and&#13;
provisions relating to resettlement and rehabilitation; (b) participation, information dissemination;&#13;
consultation and grievance procedures; and (c) implementation schedules, budgets and monitoring.&#13;
PLN's general policy concerning the establishment of overhead transmission lines (attached as Annex&#13;
4.7) has been reviewed and found acceptable by the Bank; as it conforms to Bank's policy as set forth&#13;
in OD 4.30. Agreement was reached during negotiations that for purposes of carrying out the&#13;
resettlement and rehabilitation of the affected persons under the project, PLN shall, in a manner&#13;
satisfactory to the Bank, apply the PLW's general policy concerning the establishment of overhead&#13;
transmission lines.&#13;
4.42   500 kV Transmission Lines. Based on the Initial Environmental Examination (LEE) reports&#13;
prepared by PLN in May 1995, the Paiton-Kediri and Kediii-Klaten transmission lines have no major&#13;
adverse physical, socio-economic and cultural impacts. The 415 km lines, routed through the southem&#13;
part of East Java and Central Java, affect mainly dry agricultural land, rice fields and home gardens in&#13;
villages. They also pass through a state owned forest production (teak and mahogany) area in East&#13;
Java. Land acquisition for tower sites will involve about 900 families of which 86 require relocation.&#13;
The estimated cost for compensation and resettlement is about US$ 16.2 million. Agreement was&#13;
reached during negotiations that: (1) PLN shall (a) revise the 5OOkV-RAP in accordance with PLNV's&#13;
General Policy concerning the establishment of overhead transmission lines; (b) include in the RAP&#13;
the final base line survey of affected people; and (c) furnish a SOOkV-RAP, satisfactory to the Bank&#13;
as a condtion of disbursement for this component of the Project; and (2) PLN shall adopt and&#13;
implement the 500kV-RAP, satisfactory to the Bank; for purposes of carrying out the compensation,&#13;
resettlement and rehabilitation of the Affected Persons under the 500kV transmission component of&#13;
the project (para. 4.41).&#13;
4.43   150 kV Transmission Lines and Substations. The 150 kV transmission component of the&#13;
project includes the construction of three new substations in Jakarta-West Java and their transmission&#13;
interconnection, about 60 km overhead lines in total. Greater Jakarta is the most densely populated&#13;
area in Java, so special attention will need to be paid to minimize the environmental impact of the&#13;
project. Draft LEE reports have already been prepared and reviewed with the Bank; detailed design&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
and survey of transmission lines will, however be completed only by August 1996. Therfore during&#13;
negotiations, it was agreed that: (i) the environmental and resettlement impacts of the 150 kV&#13;
transmission component shall be established and documented in the Envronent chapter of the&#13;
design reports as per guidelines satisfactory to the Bank (Annex 4 6); (ii) Resettlement Action Plan&#13;
(RAP) shall be prepared andforwarded to the Bankfor approval as a condition of disbursementfor&#13;
this component; and (iii) PLN shall adopt and implement the 150 kV RAP, satisfactory to the Bank&#13;
for purposes of carrying out the compensation, resettlement and rehabilitation of the affected persons&#13;
under the 150 kV transmission components of the project.&#13;
4.44 Distribution Facilities. The proposed loan would finance a portion of PLN's non-rural&#13;
distribution expansion in 1997. This component will include several projects in Java and Bali for&#13;
which the location and detailed design would be developed subsequently and closer to the time of&#13;
implementation. Generally, construction of non-rural distribution facilities (short length of MV&#13;
and LV overhead lines and underground cables, distribution transformers and consumer&#13;
connections) is not expected to pose major environmental problems, and negative impact can be&#13;
mitigated by selecting alternative routes, design and method of construction. During negotiations&#13;
it was agreed that: (i) PLN shall design the construction and installation of the power distribution&#13;
facilities under the distribution component of the project, and thereafter carry out such construction&#13;
and installation in such a way as to avoid any acquisition of private property or establishment of&#13;
easements therein for installing power poles and transformers; provided, however, that if the&#13;
acquisition of private property or the establishment of easements therein can not be avoided, PLN&#13;
shall promptly inform the Borrower and the Bank and proceed to compensate, resettle and&#13;
rehabilitate the Affected Persons pursuant to provisions of the PLN's General Policy concerning the&#13;
establishment of overhead transmission lines, in a manner satisfactory to the Bank; providedfurther&#13;
that if the construction and installation of these facilities as designed would adversely affect more&#13;
than 100 persons, then PLN shall, prior to the start of such works, furnish to the Bankfor its approval&#13;
a resettlement action plan prepared in accordance with PLN's General Policy concerning the&#13;
establishment of overhead transmission lines, and thereafter implement such plan as so approved&#13;
(para 4.41).&#13;
4.45   Monitoring  PLN will maintain data and progress reports on implementation of land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement measures for all components of the project. During negotiations it was&#13;
agreed that PLN will (i) on April 1, July 1, October 1, and December I of each year, commencing on&#13;
July 1, 1996, prepare andfurnish to the Bank quarterly progress reports on the implementation of the&#13;
resettlement and rehabilitation of the Affected Persons under the Project during the preceding three&#13;
(3) months; and (ii) by July 1, 1996, under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank retain an&#13;
independent entity with qualified and experienced staff to. (a) undertake the external monitoring and&#13;
supervision of the implementation of the resettlement and rehabilitation of the Affected Persons under&#13;
the Project; (b) prepare andfurnish to the Bank and PLN semiannual monitoring reports thereof, the&#13;
first of such reports to be furnished by September 30, 1996; and (c) prepare and furnish to the Bank&#13;
and PLNa final evaluation report on completion of the resettlement and rehabilitation of the Affected&#13;
Persons under the Project.&#13;

5. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION&#13;
A. Past experience and lessons learnt&#13;
5.1        The Bank has been active in Indonesia's power sector for twenty-five years during&#13;
which time the Government has borrowed more than $US 4.7 billion in Bank loans and IDA&#13;
credits to undertake 24 power projects (listed in Annex 5.1). Despite some problems with&#13;
implementation, past Bank-financed PLN projects have in general been very successful and have&#13;
helped strengthen PLN's capabilities in almost every aspect of its operations. Over the last&#13;
twenty-five years, the Bank has also engaged the Government and PLN on a dialogue on sector&#13;
issues. In the seventies and eighties, this focussed mainly on sector planning, tariff and&#13;
organizational autonomy issues. In recent years, beginning with the Sumatera-Kalimantan Project&#13;
in 1994, the Bank and Government have shifted their emphasis towards issues of sector&#13;
structure, private sector participation and regulation.&#13;
5.2        The positive lessons from  the Bank's involvement have been brought out by&#13;
successive Project Performance Audit Reports (PPARs), Project Completion Reports (PCRs) and&#13;
Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs). These reports attribute the success of power&#13;
operations in Indonesia to the facts that: (i) there was a long-term vision for the development&#13;
of the sector and this vision was shared by the Bank, Government and PLN; (ii) the vision was&#13;
translated into a long-term strategy which was resolutely pursued; and (iii) a reasonable balance&#13;
was struck between the physical and institutional development components of the projects. The&#13;
negative lessons largely concern implementation. First, most projects have suffered delays due&#13;
to extended procurement cycles and, in the case of transmission projects, problems with land&#13;
acquisition. Second, the last transmission project has required loan cancellations due to the use&#13;
of outdated cost estimates by PLN. Third, technical assistance for institutional capacity building&#13;
has in some cases fallen short of expectations due to limited absorptive capacity and inadequate&#13;
supervision and ownership. The ways in which these lessons have been incorporated into the&#13;
proposed project are detailed in paragraphs 5.17 to 5.22.&#13;
5.3        Lessons learnt from previous projects suggest that narrowly focused T&amp;D projects&#13;
that emphasize incremental engineering solutions and investments in physical capacity alone will&#13;
not result in significant improvements in efficiency and reliability standards, that are urgently&#13;
needed to move the Indonesian power system closer to compare to best practices levels. Bank-&#13;
wide experience suggests that achieving quantum and sustainable improvements in efficiency and&#13;
customer service, while placing the sector on a sound financial footing depend upon the degree&#13;
of success achieved in steering the power sector from the monopoly of a single public utility to&#13;
a more competitive, decentralized, multi-operator environment with private sector participation,&#13;
corporatization of the national utility, and, where appropriate, unbundling of its generation,&#13;
transmission and distribution functions l. Further, Bank experience indicates that although the&#13;

A. J. Covarrubias and S. B. Maia, Reforms and Private Participation in the Power Sector of Selected Latin American and&#13;
Caribbean and Industrialized Countries, LAC Technical Department, Report No.33, March 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
reform options used to restructure the sector are varied across countries, a common denominator is&#13;
the provision of the appropriate regulatory framework and related oversight.&#13;
B. Rationale for Bank involvement&#13;
5.4       Bank involvement in electricity transmission and distribution and in the policy dialogue&#13;
is clearly indicated under IBRD's Indonesia Country Assistance Strategy (CAS, Report No. 13988-&#13;
IND, 1995). The CAS argues for Bank investment in power transmission and distribution rather than&#13;
generation as private sector finance is readily available for the latter - and for Bank assistance to&#13;
improve regulatory structures so as to increase private participation (CAS, para. 58). Further,&#13;
reduction of infrastructural bottlenecks is a key element in the strategy to promote Indonesia's&#13;
productivity (CAS, para. 24). It is appropriate therefore, that Bank financing help overcome the&#13;
transmission and distribution bottlenecks that have been identified in the power sector.&#13;
5.5        The CAS (para. 37), also supports the Government's decentralization thrust. The&#13;
proposed project would promote decentralization in a major sector of the Indonesian economy.&#13;
PLN's decentralization would occur first of all in Java, where increased autonomy would be given&#13;
to the four regional distribution units. Later projects are expected to support mainstreaming of the&#13;
Bank-financed decentralization pilot currently underway outside of Java-Bali (see para. 3.14).&#13;
5.6       The Bank has been playing a unique role in the development of power sector in&#13;
Indonesia. More than other lending agencies, the Bank's primary focus has been on sectoral and&#13;
institutional development, with a view to enhancing the performance to levels that are comparable&#13;
to those of Indonesia's main competitor countries. This is to be achieved by ste-7ing the power&#13;
sector from the monopoly 7 a single public utility to a competitive, decentralize(, aiulti-operator&#13;
environment. The overall strategy for this process was set out - as a result of Bank-Government&#13;
dialogue -- by the Government in its 1993 policy statement (attached as Annex 1.2), and sector&#13;
reform is now in the implementation phase. While sectoral and PLN restructuring might occur in the&#13;
absence of the proposed project, they would probably not occur as rapidly nor in as orderly a&#13;
manner. In particular, the proposed project would aid implementation of the results of major Bank-&#13;
supervised technical assistance efforts already underway -- including private power development,&#13;
power sector regulatory reform, and establishment of PLN distribution and transmission investment&#13;
centers in Java-Bali.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
C. Project Benefits&#13;
5.7        The main economic benefits of the proposed investment in the project are to: (i)&#13;
facilitate the economic operation of the Java-Bali bulk power system as well as improve its dynamic&#13;
stability and security, by increasing the physical transfer capacity of the EHV (500 kV) transmission&#13;
system; (ii) facilitate increased customer connections and electricity sales -- especially to industrial&#13;
estates and commercial areas in and near the major urban centers -- while simultaneously reducing&#13;
the current excess generating capacity, by removing major capacity bottlenecks in the transmission&#13;
and distribution network; (iii) evacuate power under a take-or-pay contract from the 1,200 MW&#13;
private sector coal fired plant ("Paiton I"), planned to come on-line in 1998; (iv) improve customer&#13;
service and supply reliability to consumers through improved management and operations of the&#13;
distribution and customer service functions; and (v) institutional building through technical assistance.&#13;
Sectoral benefits&#13;
5.8        The project would promote the implementation of sectoral reform in the areas of private&#13;
sector participation, regulation, and PLN restructuring. This is expected to lead to greater efficiency&#13;
and a more dynamic sector, to better customer service and less reliance on government funding.&#13;
5.9        The proposed PLN restructuring would lead to greater accountability and initiative within&#13;
the corporation, and would also pave the way for the introduction of competition and private sector&#13;
participation in the transmission and distribution sub-sectors, both of which should promote&#13;
efficiency. In particular, the creation of independent distribution business centers would result in&#13;
greater responsiveness to customer demands for timely connection and reliable high-quality supply&#13;
and service. The technical assistance component of the proposed project is essential to ensure that&#13;
the benefits of restructuring are realized.&#13;
5.10       The emphasis given by the project (para. 2.56) to performance measurement is an&#13;
iimportant new development. The proposed loan would for the first time covenant not only financial&#13;
indicators (rate of return, debt service, etc), but also technical indicators (reserve margin, losses,&#13;
etc). This two-track approach is expected to provide an appropriate balance between protecting&#13;
PLN's financial health on the one hand, and providing the company v.ith greater incentives to&#13;
improve performance, on the other.&#13;
Economic Rate of Return Analysis&#13;
5.11       The project's physical components are an integral part of PLN's master plan for&#13;
optimized expansion of the Java-Bali transmission network, in light of currently committed generation&#13;
expansion. The transmission master plan, completed in 1994 under the Power Transmission Project&#13;
(Loan 3349-IND), was developed using advanced computer simulation models that evaluated the&#13;
power flows, reliability, security and economics of several alternative network expansion and&#13;
strengthening configurations (see Chapter 2, Section B and paras 4.3 through 4.6), to identify the&#13;
least cost plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
5.12      Time-slice analysis An economic internal rate of return (EIRR) has been calculated for&#13;
PLN's Java-Bali 1995/96 to 1999/2000 investment program, which the proposed loan will partially&#13;
finance.The costs included in the economic analysis are: (i) those for all investments commissioned&#13;
during the period of analysis; (ii) those for the incremental fuel and O&amp;M associated after&#13;
commissioning with these investments; and (iii) power purchases during the period. All sales&#13;
increases during the period of analysis are attributed to the investments and to the availability of new&#13;
purchased power. Sales and investment forecasts are based on a conservatively estimated annual&#13;
compound medium-term growth rate of 13.5% over 1995/96-1999/2000, which is significantly below&#13;
PLN's most recent projection of 16 % for the same period (paras 5.16-5.18). For industrial&#13;
consumers, willingness-to-pay is estimated by the cost of self generation from a captive diesel plant.&#13;
For residential consumers, willingness-to-pay is estimated by aggregating two components: (a)&#13;
consumer surplus in the diverted market i.e, cost savings from the substitution of kerosene by&#13;
electricity for lighting, and (b) the incremental consumer surplus in the new market i.e., the benefit&#13;
of increased consumption because of the availability of lower cost electricity. Willingness to pay for&#13;
commercial and public and other users is assumed equal to tariff levels. Further details of the&#13;
assumptions and calculations involved are given in Annex 5.2.&#13;
5.13      On the basis of the incremental cost and benefit streams associated with PLN's least cost&#13;
expansion program for the period 1995/96 to 1999/2000, which the proposed loan will partially&#13;
finance, and under the above assumptions, the EIRR for the least cost sector investment plan is&#13;
estimated at 25%, which shows the high return currently obtainable by focusing investment on&#13;
transmission and distribution development that has lagged generation expansion.&#13;
5.14      500 kV transmission component In addition to the conventional time-slice analysis, a&#13;
separate economic analysis has been carried out for the 500 kV transmission component of the&#13;
proposed project, using the conservative assumption that the sole purpose of the Paiton-Klaten line&#13;
is to evacuate power from the 1,200 MW Paiton I coal plant, under the provisions of the take-or-pay&#13;
contract governing that power purchase. This assumption significantly biases downwards the EIRR&#13;
for the 500 kV transmission component, since it does not reflect the other substantial benefits&#13;
attributable to the line that derive from the fact that this line is an essential and integral part of the&#13;
optimized development of the EHV grid system in Java-Bali that would afford improved economic&#13;
operation of generation plant systemwide, and improved reliability of the transmission network. This&#13;
EIRR is based on an incremental cost stream that has the following components: (i) investment cost&#13;
for the line; (ii) power purchase cost from the Paiton I power plant; (iii) and the marginal costs&#13;
associated with the HV transmission network and the distribution network (3.0 c/kWh). The&#13;
incremental benefits stream is derived from the projected sales based on the Paiton I power plant,&#13;
valued at willingness-to-pay levels as discussed in Annex 5.2, The resultant EIRR for the 500 kV&#13;
transmission component is estimated, conservatively, at 15%.&#13;
D. Project Risks&#13;
5.15      In view of the Government's and PLN's generally excellent record with regards to Bank&#13;
projects, the risk of this project producing outcomes substantially below expectations is minimal. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
primary risk is that PLN's medium-term sales growth will be below expectations; this and other&#13;
sectoral and implementation risks faced by the project are detailed below.&#13;
Slow Sales Growth Risk&#13;
5.16      PLN's sales target for Java-Bali for the period 1995/96 to 1999/2000 is an average&#13;
annual medium-term growth rate of 16%. There are two principal reasons why PLN may be unable&#13;
to meet this target. First, the demand may not materialize at this high growth rate. PLN's recent&#13;
Java-Bali sales growth indicates that its load promotion activities have had a significant impact: based&#13;
on data up to July, 1995, the Java-Bali sales growth rate for 1995 will be about 16%. However, it&#13;
is by no means certain whether continued load promotion activities will sustain a 16% growth rate&#13;
over the next five years.&#13;
5.17      Second, there may be implementation delays. In the past, most transmission and/or&#13;
distribution projects have suffered from serious delays due to extended procurement cycles, for both&#13;
equipment and consultants. In addition, in the case of transmission, lengthy delays (upwards of a&#13;
year) have been caused by difficulties in land acquisition. Procurement delays are a generic problem&#13;
for Indonesia, and there are limits to what can be achieved to improve procurement processes within&#13;
any one sector. However, PLN has agreed to use standard Bank documents, to streamline the&#13;
procurement process and to shorten the period between issue of tender and awards. With regards to&#13;
land acquisition, PLNs new General Policy concerning the establishment of overhead transmission&#13;
lines (Annex 4.7) which was approved by PLNs Board for all its transmission projects (regardless&#13;
of the source of financing) would also help reduce delays by ensuring (i) use of replacement cost as&#13;
the basis for compensation and (ii) direct negotiations between PLN and asset owners. Finally,&#13;
PLN's commercialization should make it more sensitive to the cost of delays, whatever the cause.&#13;
5.18      A lower-than-expected sales growth rate would have an adverse effect on the economic&#13;
viability of the project. Therefore, the base case economic analysis has been conducted with a&#13;
projected sales growth rate of 13.5%, which is a conservative estimate based on an independent&#13;
analysis of medium-term sales trends, instead of the 16% growth rate projected by PLN (para 5.12).&#13;
The results of further sensitivity analysis on the sales growth rate are reported in paras 5.23-5.24.&#13;
Other risks&#13;
5.19      Delays in sectoral reform Although some delays have occurred in the past, in general&#13;
the Govermnent and PLN have good implementing records once agreement has been reached on key&#13;
issues. Clear delineation of and agreement on the timing of critical decision points will assist in&#13;
monitoring and limiting any lags and significant deviations.&#13;
5.20      Sub-optimal private sector participation Rushed divestiture of PLN assets to overcome&#13;
a financing gap could lock in a non-competitive, inefficient industry structure. Likewise, a&#13;
continuation of the Government's "deal-by-deal" approach to PPAs, rather than adoption of a&#13;
competitive framework approach, could keep the price of private power high. Recent indications,&#13;
however, are that the Government is moving towards adoption of a competitive framework approach&#13;
to private sector participation in the power sector and PPA prices have fallen substantially (see para&#13;
1.17) with the adoption of competitive bidding. The government also may run the danger of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

contracting too much private power, given the current ample reserve margin; however, the&#13;
Government is now committed to reaching the agreed reserve margin target of 25 percent.&#13;
5.21      Limited effect of institutional development technical assistance While technical&#13;
assistance for engineering, design and construction management generally have performed well,&#13;
technical assistance for institutional capacity building has in some cases fallen short of expectations&#13;
due to limited absorptive capacity and inadequate supervision and ownership. However, it should also&#13;
be noted that those institutional development TAs which are linked to and "owned by" specific&#13;
functional units have performed better than those under general headquarters control. The technical&#13;
assistance planned under the current project builds on this lesson by being directed largely at&#13;
individual PLN distribution and transmission units. In addition, the Bank has now moved to an&#13;
integrated portfolio approach to the monitoring of institutional technical assistance. This has made&#13;
for more effective supervision, and reduced the likelihood of delay in the inception of technical&#13;
assistance.&#13;
5.22      Partial loan cancellation The last transmission project involved a large cancellation of&#13;
unused funds due to overly conservative cost estimates. Cost estimates under this project have been&#13;
developed by PLN using up-to-date prices.&#13;
E. Sensitivity analysis&#13;
5.23      This section considers the sensitivity of the economic rate of return -- for the time-slice&#13;
as well as the transmission component alone -- to lower than expected sales growth, which is the&#13;
primary risk.&#13;
5.24      Time-slice analysis With respect to the overall investment program for the period&#13;
1995/96 to 1999/2000, the primary risk that potentially affects the EIRR relates to the uncertainty&#13;
about the sales growth realized over the period 1995/96-1999/2000 (para 5.16). This risk has already&#13;
been taken into account by calculating the EIRR with a conservative sales growth rate of 13.5%,&#13;
instead of the 16% growth rate incorporated in PLN's projections (paras 5.12, 5.18). The results of&#13;
sensitivity analysis show that:&#13;
(i)      With PLN's projected medium-term sales growth rate of 16%, the EIRR&#13;
would be 37%, instead of the base case of 25%;&#13;
(ii)     With a slow medium-term sales growth rate of 12.5% -- which is consistent&#13;
with PLN's long-term sales growth rates -- the EIRR would be 20%;&#13;
(iii)    To reduce the EIRR to the switching value of 12%, below which the project&#13;
would not be economically justifiable, the sales growth rate over 1995/96 to&#13;
1999/2000 would have to be a low value of 10.8%. The probability of this&#13;
happening is negligible, given that: (a) PLN has already achieved a sales&#13;
growth rate of about 16% for 1995, (b) PLN's load promotion activities are&#13;
likely to raise the sales growth rate above past trends, and (c) the medium-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
term growth rate of 10.8% is below PLN's most recent historical medium-&#13;
term as well as long-term sales growth rates.&#13;
5.25      500 kV transmission component Sensitivity analysis shows the importance of timely&#13;
completion of the Paiton-Klaten line. A significant delay in the implementation of the 500 kV Paiton-&#13;
Klaten line would result in an inability on the part of PLN to evacuate power from the private Paiton&#13;
power plant, which is due to come on-stream in September 1998. Under the scenario of a one year&#13;
delay, the EIRR for the Paiton-Klaten line reduces from 15% to 12%. This scenario, however,&#13;
would have a serious financial implication for PLN on account of the take-or-pay contract on Paiton.&#13;

Govermment of Indonesia&#13;
Ministry of Mines and Energy&#13;
GOALS AND POLICIES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF&#13;
THE ELECTRIC POWER SUB-SECTOR&#13;
Background&#13;
Indonesia's basic goals and policies for the future development of the energy sector are described in the&#13;
Outlines of State Policy (Garis-Garis Besar Haluan Negara or GBHN) promulgated by the Peoples' Consultative&#13;
Assembly (MPR) in March 1993 to guide the formulation of the Sixth Medium-Term (Five-Year) Year Development&#13;
Plan (REPELITA VI) and Second Stage Long-Term (Twenty-Five Year) Development Strategy (PJPT-II). The&#13;
GBHN highlights the importance for Indonesia's sustained economic and social development of meeting its rapidly&#13;
growing energy needs efficiently--including through conservation and diversification of primary energy sources and&#13;
their more efficient utilization--and of minimizing the adverse envirornmental and social impacts of energy use. In&#13;
the electric power sub-sector, the GBHN recognizes that an adequate, reliable and reasonably priced electricity&#13;
supply is essential for the country's continuing development, emphasizing its role in serving the needs of other&#13;
productive sectors and in contributing directly to improving the living standards of the people.&#13;
The recent development of Indonesia's power sub-sector is characterized by very rapid growth in the&#13;
demand for electricity and in the total capacity of the public power supply. Over the last 15 years, the generating&#13;
capacity owned and operated by the sole state-owned power utility, Perum Listrik Negara (PLN), has incresed from&#13;
about 900 MW in 1975176 to about 11,000 MW in 1992/93. Over this same period, the number of customers&#13;
served by PLN has grown by thirteen times. These impressive achievements have been made possible by the&#13;
continuing institutional development of PLN, and by a strong commitment on the part of Government to ensuring&#13;
that PLN obtained the necessary financial and other resources.&#13;
However, the very rapid pace of growth of power demand since the mid-1980s, attributable to the success&#13;
of the Government's economic policies, has--when coupled with the country's archipelagic geography--posed&#13;
challenges that have exceeded PLN's evolving capacities. Thus while extensive power grids serve most areas of&#13;
Java and Bali, the coverage and quality of electricity supply in the outer islands generally remains very low while&#13;
costs remain stubbornly high. Moreover, even in Java and Bali, the rapid growth in industrial demand for power&#13;
has outstripped PLN's ability to supply, with the result that the capacity of privately-owned autogeneration plant&#13;
is now equivalent to around 30% of PLN's installed capacity. The Governnent recognizes that the challenges&#13;
confronting the power sub-sector will necessarily intensify in the coming plan periods, and that this in turn will&#13;
necessitate changes to the policies that have guided its development in the past.&#13;
Policy Goals for REPELITA VI and PJPT-fl&#13;
During REPELITA VI and PJPT-11 the Government's policies for the electric power subsector will be&#13;
designed to:&#13;
(a)    improve the performance of PLN, notably through decentralization, commercialization and&#13;
corporatization;&#13;
(b)    structure electricity tariffs so as to reflect more closely the economic costs of supply;&#13;
M:PTD2\SAR\ANN\POL.ANN&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1.2&#13;
Page 2&#13;
(c)    reform and refine the regulatory and institutional framework so as to foster competition and&#13;
facilitate increased and more efficient private sector participation;&#13;
(d)    enable equal access to primary energy sources at market-determined prices for publicly and&#13;
privately owned power generators; and&#13;
(e)    develop and implement appropriate measures for inducing energy conservation and improving&#13;
environmental protection.&#13;
The broad policies for achieving these goals have been established as part of the process of formulating REPELITA&#13;
VI and are outlined below.&#13;
ImnDrovinp PLN's Performance&#13;
The Government recognizes that improving the efficiency and quality of PLN's services and equipping it&#13;
to respond effectively to continuing rapid growth in demand for power will necessitate significant changes to its&#13;
present organization structure and corporate strategy. These changes, which will be implemented in a number of&#13;
carefully planned stages, will entail:&#13;
Decentralization: PLN's organization and management processes will be structured and decentralized so as to&#13;
establish profit centers along functional (generation, transmission, distribution) and geographical lines. Managers&#13;
of profit centers will be given expanded and more clearly defined decision-making responsibilities, and will be made&#13;
accountable for their performance. A system of contract-based objectives and incentives will be established to&#13;
encourage improvements in the operational performance of profit centers.&#13;
Commercialization: PLN will be required to function as a commercially oriented enterprise, with individual profit&#13;
centers planning and managing their activities in accordance with sound commercial principles. Cross-subsidy&#13;
between commnercial and non-commercial businesses will be phased out, with Government providing explicit&#13;
subsidies on a transparent basis for rural electrification and other social programs that are carefully targeted to&#13;
benefit low income groups or regions. The sub-sector regulatory and institutional framework will be enhanced, inter&#13;
alia to prevent exploitation of monopoly powers (see below).&#13;
Corporatization: PLN's corporate status and structure will be amended to reflect and reinforce these initiatives&#13;
and to enable it to compete on an equal basis with private power enterprises. The present Perum entity will be&#13;
converted progressively into a group of profit-oriented limited liability companies (Perseros): these will be&#13;
empowered to raise funds on the capital markets, and private participation in their ownership will be sought as soon&#13;
as their financial performance permits. Such state-owned companies will be expected to compete in a market-&#13;
oriented environment, with Government exercising strategic control over them on an 'arm's length" basis through&#13;
performance contracts that specify clear objectives and efficiency indicators.&#13;
Restructurin2 Tariffs&#13;
The Government's policies on electricity tariffs are designed, inter alia, to ensure the sustainable sound&#13;
financial health of the power sub-sector and, in particular, its capacity to respond effectively to the rapid growth&#13;
in demand for electric power. As a first step towards enabling PLN to play an expanded role in financing the&#13;
needed massive investments in new and replacement capacity, the average sales tariff will be increased to enable&#13;
it to achieve at least an 8% overall rate of return on revalued assets; this is expected to result in a self-financing&#13;
ratio of 30-35% for the period 1994-1999. To avoid erosion over time of the real value of the power tariff, rates&#13;
M :UTDnSARAANNTPOL.ANN&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1.2&#13;
Page 3&#13;
will be adjusted periodically to reflect changes in the costs of supply, with the mechanism adopted being designed&#13;
to promote efficiency improvements and tight control of costs.&#13;
The present sales tariff structure will be simplified and the distortions inherent in it will be progressively&#13;
reduced so as to enable rates to reflect better the costs of supply. As part of this process, the uniform national tariff&#13;
policy will be reassessed during REPELITA VI with a view to its replacement by a system of two or more regional&#13;
tariffs. Cross-subsidies between businesses and between consumer categories will be progressively phased out and&#13;
replaced by a transparent system of explicit Government subsidies for social programs or services that benefit&#13;
carefully targeted low income groups.&#13;
To facilitate increased private participation in the power sub-sector, the Govermnent will require PLN&#13;
quickly to establish and publish rates for the purchase of power from small generators through standard forms of&#13;
contract, and to establish tariffs for the bulk supply of power to distribution enterprises. The Government is&#13;
currently examining mechanisms and conditions for enabling 'third party access' to PLN transmission grids, and&#13;
intends that PLN should introduce a tariff for "power wheeling."&#13;
Reforming the Regulatory Framework and Promotinn Private Participation&#13;
The Government is committed to expanding quickly private sector participation in the power sub-sector,&#13;
both to complement PLN's efforts to meet rapidly growing power demands and to promote healthy competition that&#13;
will produce improvements in efficiency and standards of service. It recognizes that this will require, on the one&#13;
hand, a transparent, comprehensive and consistent regulatory framework to define the rules under which state-owned&#13;
and private power enterprises will operate, and, on the other, an independent agency to oversee the operation of&#13;
these regulations and, in particular, to ensure that the natural monopoly elements of the system are managed in a&#13;
manner consistent with the public interest. The oversight agency will be responsible for ensuring that regulations&#13;
are administered and applied in a transparent, timely, and consistent manner, and will be required and empowered&#13;
to deal with appeals relating to their implementation.&#13;
During 1994, the Government will review the current legal and regulatory framework for the power sector&#13;
and plans to formulate the revisions and additions that are needed to secure the above goals. It will also initiate the&#13;
establishment of a regulatory oversight agency under the Ministry of Mining and Energy by separating those&#13;
functions that relate towpower sector policy and planning from those that relate to the power industry's regulation&#13;
and oversight. As a first step, a separate Directorate of Regulation will be created within the Directorate General&#13;
of Electric Power and Energy Development. This will subsequently be converted to a higher level agency with&#13;
greater powers and independence.&#13;
The Government is currently refining its strategy for securing private participation in the sub-sector, and&#13;
is strengthening its procedures and capacities for promoting, evaluating, and negotiating proposals from private&#13;
entities. While the initial efforts in this area have focused on the solicitation of proposals for large Build-Owen&#13;
Operate (BOO) power generation projects, the existing regulatory framework permits a much broader spectrum of&#13;
private participation and considerable attention is now being devoted to exploring other opportunities. Unsolicited&#13;
proposals for BOO generation projects are being encouraged, and several are now in preparation under Letters of&#13;
Preliminary Approval. Arrangements for permitting small independent power generators to sell electricity to PLN&#13;
at published tariffs through standard forms of contract are being developed and will be finalized shortly. These&#13;
arrangements are expected encourage more efficient use of existing autogeneration capacity and to promote&#13;
development of cogeneration capacity by industrial plants.&#13;
Active consideration is now also being given to expanding the role of private enterprises and cooperatives&#13;
in the distribution / supply function, and to permitting private participation in the short-to-be-corporatized elements&#13;

of PLN. In addition, the Government intends also to require PLN to provide "third party access" to its transmission&#13;
grids for independent power producers. The conditions and charges for such access will be clearly defined and their&#13;
implementation will be monitored by the regulators oversight agency.&#13;
Enabling Equal Access to Primary Energy Sources&#13;
The Government recognizes that success in securing efficient private participation in large scale power&#13;
generation will be contingent on intending private power enterprises being able to enjoy the same access to and&#13;
prices for primary energy as are enjoyed by PLN. Accordingly, it intends to review and, where necessary, to revise&#13;
its current policies in these areas, particularly with respect to natural gas and geothermal stream, so as to make the&#13;
markets for primary energy resources open and transparent.&#13;
Promotinp Enermv Conservation and Environmental Protection&#13;
Energy conservation is a central theme of the Government's energy policies, and it is recognized that the&#13;
appropriate pricing of primary energy and of electric power as outlined above will play a key role in promoting the&#13;
economically efficient use of scarce resources. The Government's commitment to such pricing policies is reflected&#13;
in the statement of the President, made in January 1993, concerning the principles that will in future govern the&#13;
pricing of refined oil fuels for supply to the domestic market. It recognizes, however, that the proper pricing of&#13;
energy products will need to be complemented by other initiatives and measures designed to encourage and induce&#13;
sound energy use decisions, particularly on t}c part of industrial, commercial, and transport enterprises. In the&#13;
power sub-sector, the Government is now developing a strategy for encouraging the more efficient utilization of&#13;
electricity and the implementation of this strategy will be accorded high priority during REPELITA VI.&#13;
Encouraging conservation and diversification in the use of energy resources is an important element in the&#13;
Government's strategy for reducing the adverse environmental and social impacts of energy consumption. More&#13;
generally, the Government recognizes that safeguarding the environment is a prerequisite for sustainable&#13;
development, and accordingly has put in place the regulatory framework and institutions needed to achieve this.&#13;
During REPELITA VI, considerable attention and resources will be directed to ensuring that these regulations are&#13;
implemented as intended. Within the electric power sub-sector, attention will be focused on the careful planning&#13;
and design of new generation, transmission and distribution facilities so as to minimize and mitigate their impacts&#13;
on the natural environment and adjacent communities, and on effective monitoring designed to ensure proper&#13;
compliance with applicable standards and practices.&#13;
Implementation&#13;
The Government will implement the above policies through a comprehensive and carefully phased medium-&#13;
term action plan whose preparation is being coordinated by the Ministry of Mines and Energy. Other concerned&#13;
institutions and agencies, most notably representatives of the People's Representative Assembly and the Ministry&#13;
of Finance, are being consulted on those aspects of the actin plan that extend beyond the jurisdiction of the Ministry&#13;
of Mines and Energy. The action plan is conceived as an integral component of Ministry's strategy for the&#13;
development of the energy sector during REPELITA VI, and it is therefore intended that its key elements will be&#13;
finalized by the end of 1993.&#13;

SECOND POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT&#13;
NOTES AND ASSUMPIONS FOR THE FINANCIAL INDICATORS AND STATEMENTS&#13;
(a) Notes and Assumptions for the Financial Indicators (Table 2.3)&#13;
1. The rate base is the average of the current and the past year's PLN net plant in service (ie., net plant in service&#13;
minus consumer contributiops, all revalued).&#13;
2. The rate of return on net revalued assets is operating income over the rate base; this is set to 8% from 1996-&#13;
2003.&#13;
3. The rate of return on equity is net profits after interest but before tax over equity (total equity niinus the&#13;
revaluation surplus).&#13;
4. Average revenue (USc/kWh, constant prices) is the average revenue expressed in current Rp/kWh deflated by&#13;
the local inflation index into 1995 prices and then converted into USc using the 1995 exchange rate.&#13;
5. The operating ratio is operating income over operating expenses.&#13;
6. The current ratio is current assets over current liabilities.&#13;
7. The quick ratio is cash and receivables over current liabilities.&#13;
8. The annual self-financing ratio is internal sources minus cash increase all over capital expenditure.&#13;
9. The three-year average self-financing ratio is net internal sources mninus cash increases for three years all over&#13;
capital expenditure for three years (last, current and next).&#13;
10. Debt-service coverage is net income before interest plus depreciation minus taxes and DPS payments all over&#13;
debt service.&#13;
11. Debt over debt plus equity: debt is net long tenn debt and bonds; equity is total equity minus the revaluation&#13;
surplus plus unrevalued consumer contributions.&#13;
12. Additional notes are given in subsection (b) below.&#13;

(b) Notes and Assumptions for the Financial Forecasts&#13;
1. Fiscal years PLN was converted from a a government corporation (Perum) to a limited liability company&#13;
(Persero) on August 1, 1994. As a Perum, PLN's fiscal year was from 1 April-31 March. As a Persero, PLN's&#13;
fiscal year now coincides with the calender year. The 1994 calender year was never an official fiscal year for PLN&#13;
and so uses estimated actuals. 1993-94 and earlier years use audited figures. 1995 is based on the revised budget&#13;
for that year, with estimates based on the first six months used whenever possible. Figures for 1996 onwards are&#13;
projections, though PLN's draft 1996 budget figures are used where possible.&#13;
2. Inflation For the period 1995-2003, 6% local annual inflation is assumed. 2.6% is assumed for foreign inflation&#13;
(MUV index). The exchange rate is assumed to depreciate from its 1995 value, (Rp 2246/$US) at a rate equal to&#13;
the difference between the local and foreign inflation rates, so as to keep the real exchange rate constant.&#13;
Income statements&#13;
3. Energy sales Energy sales are projected in line with PLN's latest investment and sales forecasts.&#13;
4. Fuel costs and power purchases are projected as shown in Tables 4A and 4B of this annex. Over the forecast&#13;
period, fuel oil, diesel and coal are assumed to increase at the rate of international inflation. Prices for natual gas&#13;
and geothermal are assumed to remain constant in dollar terms. The nominal price for power from gas-turbine&#13;
generators which is held constant at Rpl 10/kWh. Fuel quantity requirements are simulated by PLN (note the&#13;
increased reliance on coal and gas and the reduced reliance on oil). Purchased power forecast prices are held&#13;
constant in dollar terms (7.03c for coal-fired, 5.82c for combined-cycle, 7.32c for geo-thermal) and escalated by&#13;
the rate of currency depreciation.&#13;
5. Personnel expenses consist of salaries, fringe benefits and training. Salary spending increases at the sum of the&#13;
rate of economic growth (assumed 6.5%), the rate of increase of staff size (approximately 5%), the rate of increase&#13;
in experience (2.5 %), and the inflation rate. The value of fringe benefits increases at the rate of increase in staff&#13;
size (5%) and the local inflation rate. Training is set equal to 5% of the value of salaries and fringe benefits.&#13;
6. R&amp;M materials are set at 1.6% of gross fixed assets (not revalued).&#13;
7. R&amp;M services are set at .97% of gross fixed assets (not revalued).&#13;
8. Other operating expenses increase slightly faster than the sum of local inflation and the staff growth rate.&#13;
9. Depreciation is based on category-specific depreciation rates and so vary from year to year (betwen 4.6 and&#13;
4.9%). The depreciation rate is defined as the ratio of current depreciation to the average of the current and last&#13;
year's non-revalued plant in service. Depreciation of revalued assets is the deprecation rate times the average of the&#13;
current and last year's revalued plant in service.&#13;
10. Non-operating income increases at approximately 10% p.a.&#13;
11. Non-operating expenditure increases at approximately 10% p.a.&#13;
12. Interest expenses For foreign loans, a repayment period of 20 years with a 5 year grace period is assumed and&#13;
an interest rate of 13% (with allowance for the foreign exchange risk). For local loans, an interest rate of 22% is&#13;
assumed and a repayment period of 12 years with a 2-year grace period. For bonds taken out prior to 1993-94,&#13;
actual interest rates and repayment periods are used; for bonds issued subsequently, a repayment period of 7 years&#13;
and an interest rate of 13% are assumed.&#13;
13. Corporate tax is 35% of net income after interest. However, since the tax law allows for accelerated&#13;
depreciation, PLN is not forecast to pay corporate tax.&#13;

14. Revaluation The value of PLN assets on 31 March 1979 is taken as the revalued value of PLN assets as of this&#13;
date. For revaluation for every year subsequent to that, annual escalation factors are utilized (using compounding).&#13;
For 1979/80-1986/87, the escalation factors used are those set out in Govermment Regulation No. 45 of 1986. For&#13;
revaluation subsequent to that date, PLN uses escalation rates which are the weighted average of foreign and local&#13;
inflation rates. The foreign inflation rate is given a weight of 70%, the local rate one of 30%. The foreign inflation&#13;
rate used is calculated from the MUV index multiplied by the $/Rp exchange rate, forecast or actual. The local&#13;
inflation rate used is the CPI. These are given in the table below. These escalation factors are used to revalue the&#13;
pervious year's gross fixed.assets including consumer contributions and work in progress.&#13;
15. Gross fixed assets equals revalued fixed assets at the beginning of the year (see below) plus fixed asset addition,&#13;
which is determined based on forecasts of project completion.&#13;
16. Accumulated depreciation equals revalued accumulated depreciation at the beginning of the year (see below)&#13;
plus depreciation for the year.&#13;
17. Work in progress equals revalued work in progress at the beginning of the year (see below) plus capital&#13;
expenditure minus the value of completed projects.&#13;
18. Cash balances are set equal to 12% of fuel expenses plus 8% of operating expenses plus 8% of local investment&#13;
materials.&#13;
19. Accounts receivable are set at the equivalent of 36 days.&#13;
20. Inventories are 12% of fuel expenses plus 25% of operating materials plus 25% of constructing materials.&#13;
21. Other "other assets" increase at the rate of 10% per annum.&#13;
22. Paid-in capital is the previous year's paid-in capital plus the government's equity contribution.&#13;
23. Revaluation reserve is the previous year's revaluation reserve plus this year's revalued fixed assets net of&#13;
revalued consumer contributions multiplied by the annual revaluation or escalation factor. Put differently, it is the&#13;
remainder after the current year's addition to PLN's fixed assets is subtracted from the current year's growth in&#13;
PLN 's revalued fixed assets.&#13;
24. Retained earnings is equal to the previous year's retained earnings plus net income after tax minus the&#13;
distribution of after-tax income (DPS etc) and minus the change in DPS payable.&#13;
25. Net long-term debt is equal to the previous year's gross long term debt plus new debt minus debt repaid minus&#13;
the current portion of this year's long-term debt.&#13;
26. Bonds are the previous year's plus new bonds minus retired bonds.&#13;
27. Current portion LTD over the forecast period is the amount of debt repayment in the next year.&#13;
28. Accounts payable increase at 5 % per year.&#13;
29. Other current liabilities increase at 5% per year.&#13;
30. Consumer contributions are the stock of revalued investments made by consumers.&#13;
31. Consumer deposits is the stock of deposits which will be returned upon disconnection.&#13;

33. Consumer contributions are the annual increment in accumulated consumer contributions (end of year's&#13;
consumer contribution minus last year's revalued by current year's escalation factor)&#13;
34. Consumer deposits is the annual increment in the stock of consumer deposits.&#13;
35. Contribution to DPS As a Perum, PLN was exempt from corporate tax but was obliged to contribute 55 % of&#13;
its annual net income (calculated using straight-line depreciation on unrevalued assets) to the Overall Development&#13;
Fund (DPS). Such payments were due (depending on the year) in five or ten equal installments commencing one,&#13;
two or three years after the year in which they were incurred.&#13;
36. Contribution to DCWEB, social and education funds, and bonuses PLN has contributed in the past to&#13;
DCWEB (Development of Cooperatives and Weak Economic Businesses), and to social and economic funds. Under&#13;
the forecasts, 25% of net income (using straight-line depreciation of unrevalued assets) after corporate tax is set&#13;
aside for these purposes.&#13;
37. Dividends PLN has never paid out dividends. For the forecast period, it is assumed that PLN pays our 5% of&#13;
its net income (using straight-line depreciation of unrevalued assets) after corporate tax is distributed as dividends.&#13;
38. Changes in net other assets is the change in other assets minus the change in other 'other liabilities'&#13;
39. External financing The projected financing of investment is based on the following assumptions:&#13;
(a) local financing&#13;
(i) annual issuance of Rp 1 trillion in local bonds;&#13;
(ii) Rp 600 billion from the Govemment in DIP allocation;&#13;
(iii) maximum local borrowing subject to assumed lending limits on the part of local banks due to exposure&#13;
guidelines;&#13;
(b) foreign financing&#13;
(i) average annual issuance of Rp 1 trillion in commnon stock from 1997 onwards;&#13;
(ii) new project funds-(aid/concessional loans to the Govemment passed on to PLN as equity), assumed equal to&#13;
30% of the foreign cost of outside-Java investments);&#13;
(iii) new foreign borrowing to make up the financing gap.&#13;
40. Capital expenditure is based on PLN's generation expansion plan with associated transmission and distribution&#13;
investment requirements. This plan is costed in constant prices and escalated using the foreign inflation rate (for&#13;
the foreign component) and a weighted (60-40) average of the local and foreign inflation rates for the local&#13;
component. VAT of 10% is assumed. This is applied to the pre-tax foreign component in its entirety and to 95%&#13;
of the value of the local component. An import tax of 15% is applied to the pre-tax foreign component.&#13;

Annex 4.7&#13;
Page 1&#13;
PLN's GENERAL POLICY CONCERNING&#13;
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF OVERHEAD TRANSMISSION LINES&#13;
1. General Overview  -- PLN's compensation and rehabilitation policy follows from&#13;
the national regulations on land acquisition (Kepress 55/93), whose purpose is to ensure&#13;
that people whose land is acquired for national development needs experience no decline&#13;
in their incomes or living standards. Wherever possible, PLN will explore all&#13;
opportunities to avoid land acquisition and displacement through engineering alternatives.&#13;
Where impacts are unavoidable, PLN will ensure that all affected people, as participants&#13;
in national development, are better off or at least no worse off than they were prior to&#13;
the project. Compensation for all assets acquired by PLN will be provided at their&#13;
replacement costs. PLN will also promote public understanding of the land acquisition&#13;
process through community information campaigns, public awareness programs,&#13;
community-level assistance, and the establishment of grievance procedures and local field&#13;
monitoring to help address any problems experienced by communities affected by PLN&#13;
projects. This policy will be followed by all PLN offices and should be supported by all&#13;
related Government Bodies concerned with transmission line.&#13;
2. Relevant Laws. Policies, and Regulations -- (see appendix 9) All land acquisition&#13;
in Indonesia is regulated by Presidential Decree (Kepress) 55/93 concerning Land&#13;
Acquisition for the Development of Public Interest. Additional relevant regulations&#13;
include:&#13;
a.    State Act No. 5 - 1960 concerning Basic Principles on Agrarian&#13;
b.    State Act No. 5 - 1974 concerning Basic Principles on Administration in The&#13;
Region and Elucidation&#13;
c.    State Minister/Chief of The National Land Use Agency No. I - 1994&#13;
d.    Government Regulation No. 51 - 1993 concerning Environmental Impact&#13;
Assessment.&#13;
e.    Ministry of Mines and Energy Regulation 01.P/47/M.PE/1992 concerning&#13;
"Clearance Space of High Voltage Overhead Transmission Lines and Extra High&#13;
Voltage Overhead Transmission Lines for the Supply of Electric Power"&#13;
f.    WHO Recommendation IRPS 1990/INIRC Guidelines of Limits of Exposure to&#13;
50/60 Hz Electric and Magnetic Fields (EMF)&#13;
3.       ons -- (see appendix 8 ) This policy covers all people affected by PLN&#13;
transmission line projects, irrespective of their land tenure status. "Projects" include all&#13;
impacts associated with PLN activities, such as land acquisition associated with the need&#13;
for access roads. Families losing all of their productive assets (farmland, house or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.7&#13;
Page 2&#13;
business) or in cases when the remaining assets are not economically viable, will be&#13;
entitled for full compensation for the remainder of their land or property at replacement&#13;
cost and to rehabilitation assistance that allows them to enhance or at least maintain their&#13;
standard of living. All families affected by the PLN project who are present at the time&#13;
of the baseline survey are eligible for compensation.&#13;
Clearance Space means the space around the conductors formed by the Minimum&#13;
Clearance to the objects as defined by PLN technical guidelines where no residence or&#13;
physical intrusions are permitted. Areas where PLN requires temporary passage but no&#13;
permanent acquisition are called easement areas. Land and other assets acquired for&#13;
clearance spaces or easements will be compensated at their replacement costs.&#13;
4. Avoiding or MinimtizinLg Impacts -- Projects will seek to minimize all physical&#13;
impacts by exploring alternative route alignments. Special attention will be given to&#13;
avoiding as much as possible areas with dense populations, schools and other public&#13;
facilities, shopping areas, and housing developments. Where there are no options,&#13;
projects should use lattice extended towers to raise the clearance space so that it is&#13;
situated above the building of at least the Minimum Clearance Space allowed (see Table -&#13;
MM&amp;E Regulation No. 01.P).&#13;
5. Public Information and Participation -- PLN survey teams will provide site-specific&#13;
maps describing physical impacts and project needs. Prior to any land acquisition, PLN&#13;
will conduct a public consultation and information campaign to inform the people of the&#13;
project and to absorb their views on impacts, concerns, compensation procedures,&#13;
resettlement options, and project activities. If necessary consultation programs can be&#13;
assisted by qualified independent bodies (i.e. university), who can provide informal door-&#13;
to-door interviews to get reliable information and to establish close communication&#13;
between the project and affected people. Consultation should begin at the same time as&#13;
initial project surveys.&#13;
6. Compensation and Rehabilitation (see Appendix 8 &amp; Apprndix 10) -- Land&#13;
acquisition policy refers to Keppress 55/1993 and its implementing regulations. Land&#13;
acquisition and compensation should be done directly between PLN and affected people.&#13;
Compensation will be provided for all land and houses purchased by PLN (i.e. for&#13;
towers, substations, access roads, etc.) and for all objects acquired within the clearance&#13;
space. Compensation rates for all land and fixed assets will be at their replacement costs;&#13;
i.e. sufficient so that the owner can find a better or equivalent replacement. This activity&#13;
will involve the Camat, the Kepala Desa, and the affected family. Land acquisition&#13;
mapping will be done by BPN (Badan Pertanahan Nasional). Project maps and&#13;
compensation lists will be posted locally, in the office of the Lurah and project office,&#13;
where they will be visible to the affected people. Where resettlement is necessary, PLN&#13;
will develop resettlement options that can include cash payments or equivalent,&#13;
replacement land as described by Government Regulation, or other forms of assistance&#13;
based on discussions with the resettler families. All families affected by the project&#13;
activities should have the opportunity to improve or at least recover their living&#13;
standards.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.7&#13;
Page 3&#13;
7. Procedure&#13;
a.    PLN purchases land, plant, houses that exist in foundation locations for towers,&#13;
and all fixed assets i.e. trees &amp; buildings within Clearance Space (see M M &amp; E&#13;
Regulation no. 01.P Part Three - Article 5 items (2),(3), &amp; (4)) at replacement&#13;
rates as defined in Para. 6, above. Easements will also be paid at replacement&#13;
cost (see M M &amp; E Regulation No.Ol.P Part three -Article 5 items (6) &amp; (7);&#13;
Part one - Article 3 items (2) &amp; (3); Part two - Article 4 items (2) &amp; (3)).&#13;
b.    The procedure for land compensation is as follows:&#13;
Guidance &amp; Counseling-- The PLN Project Team, in cooporation with the head&#13;
of Subdistrict &amp; head of Village, provides a special meeting with the project&#13;
affected people (PAPs) regarding the project and to elicit their views and&#13;
concerns. PLN's public information brochure should be distributed at this time.&#13;
Public Consultation with the project affected people will be conducted by the PLN&#13;
and involve related Government agencies. Agencies will provide all necessary&#13;
information about the project and related matters, including the timing and&#13;
procedures for compensation.&#13;
The next step is to stake out the boundaries of the needed land.&#13;
Then follows the detailed mapping of the land holdings.&#13;
After the maps are completed, the inventory of crops, vegetation, buildings and&#13;
other assets will be conducted.&#13;
The next step is to prepare the list of the acreage of the land holdings, structures,&#13;
and the volume of the affected crops.&#13;
PLN prepares a list of compensation  for land and assets based on the&#13;
replacement cost. The guiding principles to determine replacement costs are&#13;
described in Appendix 10. Any transaction costs, as defined in this policy (para.&#13;
6), will be provided by PLN. Records will be kept and reported, and made&#13;
available to the affected people.&#13;
The final price of the properties should be negotiated between both parties (PLN&#13;
&amp; PAP) to reach full agreement that compensation reflects replacement costs.&#13;
The final list should be approved and signed by both parties. Grievances that&#13;
cannot be resolved locally should be resolved through the procedures defined by&#13;
Kepress 55/93.&#13;
The final step will be payment of the compensation directly to the landowners and&#13;
other affected people as agreed between PLN and the project affected people.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.7&#13;
Page 4&#13;
8. Responsibilities and Grievance Procedures -- (see appendix 1). PLN will remain&#13;
ultimately responsible for ensuring that people affected by project activities receive the&#13;
compensation defined by this policy. To ensure that this policy is carried out effectively,&#13;
each project will appoint a "resettlement officer" reporting to the project Pimpro.&#13;
Resettlement officers will ensure that all required activities are carried out promptly.&#13;
Resettlement officers will receive all necessary logistical and staff support. Pimpros&#13;
should make special efforts to ensure good community relationships and to promptly&#13;
resolve compensation problems and complaints. Problems that cannot be resolved&#13;
satisfactorily should be resolved through discussions with assistance from the responsible&#13;
local government authorities. Monitoring by PLN pusat, with assistance from a qualified&#13;
independent body if needed, will ensure that all people affected by PLN projects receive&#13;
compensation and any agreed rehabilitation assistance as defined by this policy.&#13;
9. Planning Policies -- Resettlement plans will be prepared for all transmission projects.&#13;
Plans will include an identification of all anticipated impacts, compensation guidelines,&#13;
implementation policies for land acquisition and resettlement, field assignments for PLN&#13;
agents responsible for resolving problems, agreements with civil agencies, an&#13;
implementation schedule linked to the anticipated civil works, and a detailed budget for&#13;
compensation and any other necessary resettlement activities. Where more than five&#13;
families are affected in any one site, more detailed information should be provided to&#13;
indicate how production will be restored, such as through PLN's assistance to identify&#13;
and transfer equivalent productive land. These items should be summarized in the PLN&#13;
overview sheet attached to transmission lines project proposals for review. Compensation&#13;
payments to affected families will be completed for eqach subproject before the start-up&#13;

Replacement Cost&#13;
PLN will determine the replacement cost of (a) agricultural land, by applying the market&#13;
prices of land of productive potential in the vicinity at the time of acquisition; (b) houses and&#13;
other structures and homestead land, by assessing in the local market current construction costs&#13;
of houses and other structures and current market prices of land at the time of acquisition; (c)&#13;
trees, by applying the market value; and (d) crops, by applying the market value of one year&#13;
standing crops. Compensation for trees and crops should be in an amount sufficient to cover&#13;
the costs associated with their replanting. PLN may also consider market prices without&#13;
depreciation and NJOP values for purposes of valuation and compensation provided that the&#13;
valuation results in a compensation payment equal to, or higher than, the replacement cost&#13;
determined above. PLN may also retain the services of other qualified persons such as valuers,&#13;
engineers and consultants or organizations to recommend rates of compensation based on the&#13;
above mentioned principles of replacement cost.&#13;

SECOND POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT&#13;
INVESTMENT ECONOMIC APPRAISAL NOTES AND TABLES&#13;
Investment Economic Appraisal Notes&#13;
1.     In projects involving transmission and distribution where the benefits attributable to specific components&#13;
are difficult to assess, it is appropriate to evaluate the economic rate of return of the entire investment program.&#13;
An economic analysis of PLN's least cost investment program in Java-Bali for the period 1996-1997 to 1999-2000&#13;
(the "investment period") -- which the proposed project partially supports -- is the most appropriate way to judge&#13;
the economic rate of return for the project.&#13;
2.     The GOI fiscal year (April 1-March 31) is used for appraisal purposes. Even though PLN has switched&#13;
to a calender-based fiscal year, investment planning uses the old fiscal year for GOI budgetary purposes.&#13;
3.     There are four cost categories: investment, fuel, power purchase and operating and maintenance (O&amp;M).&#13;
The investment costs are for generation, transmission and distribution to be commissioned during the period&#13;
(whether or not the expenditures are incurred during the period).&#13;
4.     Investment costs are based on the disbursement profiles given in Annex 2.4 for Java-Bali, with additional&#13;
disbursements allowed prior to 1996 for generating plant to be commissioned during the period. The unit of&#13;
valuation is 1995 $US, so the 1994 figures in Annex 2.4 are updated using the 1994 MUV rate of foreign inflation&#13;
in $US (3.1 %). All transmission and distribution investment disbursed during the period is assumed to be made&#13;
operational during the investment period, except for the second last and last years. All generating investment&#13;
disbursed up to 1997 is made operational during the investment period, but then the ratio declines over time.&#13;
5.     Fuel costs are estimated by incremental fuel quantities (over the base year, 1995) multiplied by estimated&#13;
fuel prices. Economic prices are given in Table 5.1 following. For years after 2003, it is assumed that prices are&#13;
constant in dollar terms.&#13;
6.     Power purchase quantities are taken from PLN's forecasts, and prices from PLN's financial forecasts for&#13;
Java-Bali (see Annex 2.6). For the economic analysis, the tax element implicit in the power purchases (due to value&#13;
added tax and corporate tax) is estimated on the basis of GOI information to be approximately 15 % of the price paid&#13;
by PLN and is subtracted.&#13;
7.     Operating and maintenance costs are set at 2.5% of accumulated investment costs.&#13;
8.     It is assumed that all increments in sales during the analysis period are due to the commissioned&#13;
investments, associated fuel and O&amp;M costs, and power purchases of that period. (The operating costs and sales&#13;
generated by capital commissioned in earlier years are assumed unchanged.) The sales increments are taken from&#13;
the RUKN 1995 load forecasts for the four groups of residential, industrial, commercial and public and other.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 5.2&#13;
Page 2&#13;
9.      Benefits of the investment program have been estimated by the revenue from electricity sales on the basis&#13;
of the average electricity tariff, for the four consumer groups -- residential, industrial, conumercial, and others --and&#13;
supplemented in the case of residential and industrial consumers by the consumer surplus.&#13;
10.    For industrial consumers, their willingness-to-pay is estimated by the cost of self-generation, which is&#13;
estimated at 10.00 clkWh, giving an additional economic benefit (consumer surplus) of 3.57 c/kWh over the average&#13;
1995 tariff. This is assumed to remain constant in real terms over time. For residential consumers, it is assumed&#13;
that the additional supply of electricity leads to households switching from kerosene to electricity. Consumer surplus&#13;
is estimated by two components: (a) consumer surplus in the diverted market i.e, cost savings from the substitution&#13;
of kerosene by electricity for lighting, and (b) the incremental consumer surplus in the new market i.e., the benefit&#13;
of increased consumption because of the availability of lower cost electricity. The method of calculation is explained&#13;
in the text to Figure 5.1. The average residential benefit is estimated at 18.78 c/kWh, giving an additional economic&#13;
benefit (consumer surplus) of 11.65 kWh over the average 1995 tariff. This is assumed to remain constant over&#13;
time.&#13;
11.    A discount rate of 12% is used.&#13;

Benefits for Residential Consumers&#13;
1.             The methodology used to estimate economic benefits for residential consumers can be expaisned&#13;
with the help of Figure I above, which shows a demand function for a household defined by two points. One end of&#13;
the function is anchored by the price-quantity pair (Q1,P1), where Q1 denotes household consumption of electricity at&#13;
PLN's average price, P1, to this consumer class. To anchor the "upper end" of the demand function, which represents&#13;
consumer willingness to pay for higher valued uses of electricity, the price-quantity pair (Q00pk) is estimated assuming&#13;
that kerosene would be used for lighting absent availability of electricity. Household survey data on kerosene&#13;
consumption and expenditure for lighting and other data were utilized to establish the monthly kWh consumption (Q0)&#13;
that would yield an equivalent amount of lighting intensity (lumens) prior to the availability of electricity; as well as to&#13;
convert the unit financial price of kerosene to an equivalent financial cost per kWh of lighting (Pk). Thus, prior to&#13;
electrification, Q0 units of kerosene (in kWh equivalence) are consumed at a financial price of Pk. Following&#13;
electrification, Q1 units of electricity are consumed at a price of Pi.&#13;
2.             The net economic benefit associated with released resources is estimated as (Pke- PI.) Q0, where Pk.&#13;
represents the economic price of kerosene per kWh of equivalent lighting, Pie is the economic cost of electricity&#13;
supply, and Q0 is defined above.&#13;
3.             The incremental consumer surplus on the diverted market is represented by the shaded area in Figure&#13;
1. A linear demand function is postulated between the points (Ql, PI) and (Qo, Pk) for the purpose of estimating the&#13;
consumer surplus. This specification tends to underestimate the willingness to pay since it does not account for the&#13;
additional value of the higher quality of light obtained from electricity.&#13;
4.             Using the method outlined in the preceding paragraphs, the average willingness to pay for residential&#13;
consumers is estimated to be 18.78 US cents/kWh in Java-Bali, of which consumer surplus is estimated to be 11.65&#13;
c/kWh. This estimate assumes average monthly consumption of 86 kWh per residential consumer in Java-Bali (1032&#13;
kWh per year).&#13;

1995 US$ prices up the year 2005. After 2005, the price of petroleum is assumed unchanged. The HSD and&#13;
fuel oil prices are then calculated by using refinery ratios of 1.35 and 0.85 respectively (average differentials&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Second Power
            Transmission and Distribution Project is to improve customer
            service by: (1) increasing the physical capacity,
            efficiency, and reliability of the Java-Bali transmission
            system and distribution network; and (2) promoting sector
            efficiency, competition, and private sector participation by
            implementing functional decentralization of State
            Electricity Corporation (PLN) operations in Java-Bali and
            developing effective regulatory oversight and institutions.
            The project has two principal components: (1) the
            restructuring of and investment in PLN's operations;
            and (2) the development of regulatory oversight.
