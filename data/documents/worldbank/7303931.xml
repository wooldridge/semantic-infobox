Does the project depart from the CAS in content or other significant respects?&#13;
Avian influenza was not a threat during CASpreparation and is not specijkally&#13;
mentioned therein. However, theproposed assistance is aligned with a CASpillar i.e.,        []Yes [XIN o&#13;
Social Sector Development, as the risk of eroding human capital due to this disease is&#13;
serious, ifthe epidemic does strike.&#13;

  Projectdevelopmentobjective:&#13;
  The overall objectives o fthe Project are to minimize the threat inNepal posed to humans by Highly&#13;
  Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) infection by controlling such infections amongbirds, especially&#13;
  domestic poultry, and to prepare for, control, andrespond to possible human infections, especially an&#13;
  influenza epidemic and related emergencies. Though the objectives are specific to HPAI,the&#13;
  interventions are expected to contribute to the control o f other zoonotic diseases and other types o f&#13;
  infectiousdiseases, interms o f buildingoverall response capacity. These objectives will be achieved&#13;
  through three types o f interventions: (i)&#13;
                                           prevention; (ii)preparedness and planning; and (iii)  response and&#13;
  containment. Ifthese types o f interventions achieve their goals, the proposed Project will reduce the&#13;
  burdeno f disease, the consequent economic losses, the risk o f human infechon and the loss o f&#13;
  Droductivitv attributable to human infections inNeDal and limit the nsk o f HPAIto other countnes.&#13;

A. STRATEGIC CONTEXTAND RATIONALE&#13;
1. Country andsector issues&#13;
&#13;
Avian influenza: Outbreaks o fHighlyPathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) caused by the H5N1 subtype&#13;
o f influenzaA were first recognized inHongKong in 1997. Since late 2003, this subtype has been&#13;
spreading at an alarmingrate, from East Asia to Central Asia, and now to the Middle East, Europe,&#13;
Africa, and South Asia. Inaddition to its impact on animal health, with millions of domestic poultry&#13;
having died or been destroyed worldwide, H5N1 has been causing severe human disease. Of the known&#13;
258 humans with confirmedHPAIas o fNovember 2006, most (154) have died. The rapidly expanding&#13;
area inwhich HPAIhas been discovered and the escalating number o f human infections have raised&#13;
concerns worldwide over the possible evolution o f the next influenza pandemic and its disastrous&#13;
consequences.'&#13;
&#13;
Nepal's risk status: Nepal i s a landlocked Himalayan country o f 24 million people. The country has so far&#13;
not had any cases o f HPAIineither avians or humans. However, the country i s at highrisk, with the&#13;
disease recorded inChina to the north and inIndia to the south. The limitedborder controls with China&#13;
andIndia on animal andhumanpopulation flow increases the potential for spread o f infectionto Nepal. In&#13;
addition, Nepal i s on two routes for migratory birds, which are h o w n carriers o f the disease. The ability&#13;
to detect avian influenza inthe country is severely handicapped due to access problems related to Nepal's&#13;
ruggedterrain and widespread security problems.&#13;
&#13;
Poultry sector and veterinary services: There are an estimated 22 million chickens and 408 thousand&#13;
ducks inNepal. The poultry industry employs roughly 400,000 people, and provides livelihood to&#13;
millions o frural households. Poultry farming takes place within two systems: 45 percent o f (hybnd) birds&#13;
are found ina few large commercial farms located inperi-urban areas. The remainder consists o f&#13;
backyardunitso f indigenous fowl and ducks inroughly half o f the rural households across Nepal. While&#13;
most o f the commercial farms have good bio-secunty arrangements inplace, poultry meat marketing i s&#13;
traditional and unorganized, i.e. sold, transported, and butchered inthe open air, with no disposal&#13;
mechanism for waste material. There i s a well-knit vetennary infrastructure with one central vetennary&#13;
hospital, 75 distnct livestock service offices, 999 livestock service centres, 132 livestock officers, 178&#13;
veterinary officers, 1,000 para-vetennary staff and 6,000 village animal health workers.. There i s&#13;
considerable experience inthe control o f many livestock diseases. However, there i s no experience with&#13;
culling and disposal o f chicken and related compensation to farmers. Bio-secunty protocols, ring-fencing&#13;
and foreign border quarantine are under implementation, and there was for a time a ban on imports o f&#13;
poultry from India as a result o f the recent outbreaks o f avian influenza inthat country. The Ministryo f&#13;
Agriculture and Cooperatives (MoAC) i s already suffering from capacity constraints for the testing o f&#13;
suspicious birds (1,800 have been tested thus far). Checking o f trans-border movements o f animals i s a&#13;
daunting task because o fremoteness o f the borders from the capital, insufficient check-posts, and&#13;
traditional free movement o f animals and people between India and Nepal.&#13;
&#13;
Human health: A public health service delivery system i s reasonably well established inNepal with the&#13;
MinistryofHealthandPopulation(MoHP) at the center, five regionalhealthdirectorates, regional and&#13;
&#13;
 Avian influenza (also called avian flu or bird flu) refers to a group of different influenza viruses that primarily&#13;
affect birds.An influenza pandemic happens when a new subtype emerges that has not previously circulated in&#13;
humans. IfH5N1adapts into a strain that is contagious among humans, it will no longer be a birdvirus but a human&#13;
influenza virus.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                            1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
zonal hospitals and district level hospitals. All 75 distncts have health offices and district hospitals with&#13;
an outreach network o f 188 primary health care centers, 698 village healthposts and 3,2 19 sub-health&#13;
posts. However, the health system i s constrained by quality o f care and access, issues that are being&#13;
addressed within the IDNDFID-financedNepal Health Sector Program. With respect to a possible&#13;
pandemic, this system will be requiredto: (i)   detect and characterize human influenza outbreaks promptly&#13;
through surveillance mechanisms within the existing system for disease control and epidemic&#13;
management; (ii)   be prepared to diagnose and treat large numbers o f people with influenza and its&#13;
complications; (iii) implement a communication strategy to inform the public on the progress o f avian&#13;
influenza, its risks and threats, methods o f self-protection against infection, sources o ftreatment, and; (d)&#13;
ensure inter-sectoral and inter-governmental coordination inprepanng for, and responding to, the threat&#13;
o f awan influenza and its possible spill-over to the human population.&#13;
&#13;
National PreparednessPlan: MoAC and MoHP are well aware o fthe potential risko f awan influenza.&#13;
The Government o fNepal (GoN) set up an inter-sectoral Task Force under the chairmanship o fthe&#13;
Director-General o fHealth Services (DGHS) to coordinate Nepal's response to avian influenza andits&#13;
potential for human infections. In early 2006, the M o A C and MoHPjointly prepared a National Avian&#13;
Influenza and Influenza Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan (NAIIPPRP) with assistance from the&#13;
World Health Organization(WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization(FAO).This Planwas&#13;
formally endorsedby the GoN. After prepanng the plan, the Task Force was dismantled and the&#13;
coordination function now resides under a technical sub-committee o fthe CentralNatural Disaster Relief&#13;
Committee (CNDRC). The NAIIPPRPprovldes a strong basis on which to detect and combat possible&#13;
outbreaks, and outlines the institutional mechanisms for doing so. The plan i s also candid about what&#13;
capacity and resource constraints exist. This NAIIPPRPwas later supplemented with an Operational Plan,&#13;
which formed the basis for the World Bank appraisal and this Technical Annex.&#13;
&#13;
2. Rationalefor World Bank involvement&#13;
&#13;
First,the growing pandemic risk, andthe needfor a coordinated internationalresponse provides a global&#13;
public goods argument for Bank involvement. Second, with its experience elsewhere, the Bank i s well&#13;
placed to field multi-sectoralteams to tackle the technical, social, economic, and regulatory dimensions o f&#13;
the problem on a country-by-country basis. Third, while agencies such as W H O and FA0have the&#13;
technical expertise to assist the respective line departments, the Bank has a comparative advantage in&#13;
workmg with the Ministryo f Finance (MoF) and the National Planning Commission (NPC)             -- critical in&#13;
any inter-sectoral activity such as preparedness for andresponse to avian influenza. Fourth, despite donor&#13;
interest from many sides, a considerable financing gap i s likely to remain without World Bank&#13;
participation. Finally, the Bank has now inplace an Adaptable Program Loan (APL)to finance the Global&#13;
Programfor Awan Influenza and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response (GPAI), which can&#13;
rapidly support country-specific preparedness using guidelines for accelerated project processing. The&#13;
current Technical Annex i s consistent with the GPAI guidelines for project processing.&#13;
&#13;
Notwithstanding the comparative advantages o f the Bank, the avian influenza program will require the&#13;
financial and technical inputso f all development partners. Thus, the proposed project i s being tightly&#13;
coordinated with programs supported by agencies such as the EU, FAO, WHO, UNICEF,UNDP,&#13;
AusAid, and USAID. For example, USAID is provlding fundingthroughFA0to build surveillance&#13;
capacity. UNDP i s workmg with the Ministries o f Local Development (MOLD)and Home Affairs&#13;
(MoHA) to builddisaster preparedness andresponse capacity. WHO has been instrumental inpreparing&#13;
the NAIIPPRPand Operational Planwhich providedthe basis for the proposed Project. UNICEFhas&#13;

list o fparticipants).&#13;
&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
1. Projectdevelopment objectiveand key indicators&#13;
&#13;
The overall objectives o f the Project are to minimize the threatposed by HPAI to humans in Nepal by&#13;
controlling such infections among birds, especially domesticpoultly, andpreparingfor, controlling, and&#13;
responding topossible human infections, especially an influenza epidemic and related emergencies.&#13;
Though the objectives are specific to HPAI, the interventions are expected to contribute to the control o f&#13;
other zoonotic diseases and other types o finfectious diseases, interms o f buildingoverall response&#13;
capacity. These objectives will be achieved through three types o f interventions: (i) prevention; (ii)&#13;
preparedness and planning; and (iii)  response and containment. Ifthese types o f interventions achieve&#13;
their goals, the proposed project will reduce the burdeno f disease inanimal and the consequent economic&#13;
losses. Itwill also lower the risk o fhuman infection and the loss o fproductivity attributable to human&#13;
infectionsinNepal. Finally, it would limit the nsk o f HPAIinother countnes.&#13;
&#13;
Key outcome indicators for the development objective will be: (i)    Positivebehawour change among&#13;
poultry farmers, health workers, and general population interms o fkey aspects o f howledge, attitudes&#13;
and practices (assessed through sample surveys); (ii)  continued absence o f HPAIinpoultry and effective&#13;
containment o fHPAIinfection inpoultry incase o f outbreaks. A key output indicator is a national&#13;
integratedpreparedness, control and response plan prepared and operationalized inaccordance with the&#13;
Global Framework for Avian Influenza, which i s developed by WHO, OIE, and FAO.Key output&#13;
indicators for the animal health component will include: (i)  percent coverage o fbackyard and commercial&#13;
poultry farms under surveillance; (ii) number o f functional check-posts and active border patrol teams;&#13;
(iii)percentage o fNepal laboratoryresults consistent with internationalreference laboratoryresults; (iv)&#13;
percent o f avian influenza outbreaks (ifany) which are controlled, contained, and stamped out; and (v)&#13;
percentage o f farmers receiving the promised compensation fund on a timely basis. For the human health&#13;
component, key indicators are: (i)  percentage increase insurveillance sites submittingperiodic reports;&#13;
(ii)percentage coverage inquality control tests to diagnose and investigate possible avian influenza&#13;
outbreaks; (iii) improvement incapacity o fhealth system to prevent occurrence o fHPAIamong human&#13;
population; and (iv) health care system strengthened and readiedto cope with increased demand for&#13;
critical services and contingency plans for an epidemic. For the communications program, the key&#13;
indicators are: (i)comprehensive communicationprogram launched; and (ii)       evidence o fhighlevel&#13;
awareness o fprogram messages among target groups. Performance o f the project coordination component&#13;
will be measuredby: (i) percentage o fplanned activities which take place on schedule; and (ii)&#13;
                         the                                                                         the&#13;
timely submission o f accurate reporting. (See Annex 2 for details).&#13;
&#13;
2. Financinginstrument&#13;
&#13;
The Project i s proposed to be financed under the GPAI's Adaptable ProgramLoan, which i s available to&#13;
countries demonstrating that they have: (i)  a national strategic plan; (ii)&#13;
                                                                          national commitment; (iii) an&#13;
implementation strategy through concerted action among ministries, donor community, and civil society;&#13;
and (iv) a clearly definedmonitonng and evaluation system. The preparation team considers that these&#13;
critena have been satisfied (see Annex 1).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The proposed project will be financed with $18.2 million o f IDA grant. The project implementation&#13;
period is four and a halfyears. The grant i s beingprocessedas an emergency investment operation using&#13;
procedures under OP 8.50 -Emergency Recovery Loan procedures. Incontrast to several avian influenza&#13;
projects elsewhere, this Project i s not proposed to be financed from existing IDA credits, such as the&#13;
ongoing Health Sector Program, but will involve new IDA financing. The grant meets all applicable Bank&#13;
policies, practices, and standards as discussed below.&#13;
&#13;
3. Project components&#13;
&#13;
(a)     Animal Health: This component will support nationalprevention and control strategies and will&#13;
finance activities for: (i)&#13;
                          enhancing avian influenza prevention and preparedness; (ii)     strengthening&#13;
veterinary services, disease surveillance, and diagnostic capacity; and (iii)  strengthening vetennary&#13;
services and avian influenzacontrol programs and outbreak containment plans, including improving bio-&#13;
secunty inpoultry production and trade. This component will also provide resources for a Compensation&#13;
Fundto cover poultry owners for loss o fassetscausedbymandatory culling o ftheir birds.The&#13;
component would be implemented by the Departmento f Livestock (DoLS) inM o A C and, where&#13;
appropriate, through implementingpartners such as FAO.&#13;
&#13;
(b)      Human Health: This component aims to prevent a human influenza epidemic caused by HPAI,&#13;
and incase this cannot be prevented, reduce its impact, through: (i)  year-round, multifaceted surveillance&#13;
linked to prompt investigation; (ii) buildinglaboratory capacity to enable effective and accurate diagnosis&#13;
/case-detection as part o fthe overall public health system response; (iii) prevention and containment&#13;
activities including social distancing measures, the use o f vaccines and antivlrals where appropriate, and&#13;
an effective quarantine system; and (iv) health care systempreparedness should human disease occur,&#13;
including patient triage, adequate facilities, and standardized case management. It will support activities&#13;
for training health workers inthe public and private sector on diagnosing and treating potential cases o f&#13;
HPAI.Itwouldhelp improve public healthprogramplanning and coordinating, strengthenthe national&#13;
public health surveillance system, and enhance the health system capacity to deal with the threat o f H P A I&#13;
and related emergencies ina prompt and effective manner. This component will be implementedinclose&#13;
coordination with the Nepal Health Sector Program, which includes strong donor harmonization, specific&#13;
sector reforms and results-based programming. The component would primarily be implementedby the&#13;
Departmento f Health Services (DoHS) inMoHP (withinwhich different units are responsible for&#13;
different sub-components) and, where appropriate, through implementingpartners such as WHO.&#13;
&#13;
(c)      Communication: This programme i s cross-cutting and underpins both the Animal Health and&#13;
HumanHealth components o f the Project. Within the communication activities, a clear identification o f&#13;
responsibilities was agreed upon dmng the mission as follows: (i)     activities related to animal health, to be&#13;
implementedby the DoLS; (ii)     activities related to human health, to be implementedby DoHS; and (iii)&#13;
cross-cutting activities such as macro-level inter-sectoral advocacy and coordination, and the&#13;
conceptualization and development o f communication campaigns and the development o f communication&#13;
training package, to be implementedthrough UNICEF.The technical and implementation support o f UN&#13;
Agencies would be sought by GoN as a last resort, incase GoN capacity i s constrained and the&#13;
emergency nature o f the program does not permitthe approach o f buildingcapacity first. There i s also a&#13;
National Avian Influenza/Human Influenza CommunicationsWorking Group to ensure coordination&#13;
among the three parts o fthis component. This component i s designed to safeguardhuman health, in&#13;
particular for extension staff, animal health workers, poultry producers and their families, by improving&#13;
public awareness and information on avian influenza issues. Information and communication activities&#13;
are aimed at increasing the attention and commitment o f Government, the private sector and civil society&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
organizations and to raise awareness, and understanding among the general population about the nsk and&#13;
potential impact o f a pandemic, methods o f self-protection against infection, and sources o f treatment.&#13;
Communication efforts would also be targeted to poultry farmers on ways o frecognizing the signs and&#13;
symptoms o f avian influenza, safe methods o f disposing o f infectedbirds, and steps to protect themselves&#13;
and their families. This component will bejointly implementedby DoLS and DoHS, and in some cases&#13;
byUNICEF, butwill adhere to a single communicationstrategy and will be coordinated bythe Project's&#13;
steenng committee (see next paragraph).&#13;
&#13;
(d)      Project Management: This component will support the strengthening o fpublic agencies for the&#13;
coordinationand management o fthe Project. There will be no formal Project Implementation Unit,but&#13;
staff within DoLS and DoHS would be assigned (and trained) to a Core Coordination Team (CCT) to&#13;
handle key functions including financial management, procurement, and monitoring and evaluation o f&#13;
Project activities, as well as compliance with agreed environmental management frameworks. The overall&#13;
coordinationwill be carned out by the Technical Sub-committee on Avian Influenza (TSCAI), o f the&#13;
Central Natural Disaster ReliefCommittee, constituted by the Council o f Ministers. This Technical Sub-&#13;
committee will serve as the steering committee for the Project.&#13;
&#13;
C. IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
1. Partnershiparrangements&#13;
&#13;
The NAIIPPRPand this Project have been preparedby GoN with the support o f several development&#13;
partners, i.e., the EuropeanUnion, UNDP, UNICEF, WHO, FAO,USAID, and the World Bank (see&#13;
Annex 9). There i s an External Development Partners (EDP) group, focusing solely on avian influenza&#13;
issues, which meetsregularly and shares information with a view to coordinatingthe various donor-&#13;
supported actiwties. While a similar group meets to discuss sector-wide health matters, a separate group&#13;
with a focus on avian influenzawas considerednecessary inview o fthe inter-sectoral natureo fthis&#13;
problem. This group intends to continue to meet throughout the period o f Project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
2. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements&#13;
&#13;
Coordination: The Project would fall under the umbrella o fthe CentralNatural Disaster Relief&#13;
Committee (CNDRC) which i s chaired by the Secretary o f the Ministry o f Home Affairs (MoHA). The&#13;
CNDRC activates only inthe case o f outbreak o f disaster. Duringnon-outbreak periods, an TSCAI,&#13;
chairedjointly by the Secretaries for MoHP and MoAC, has been created. The Project mustensure inter-&#13;
component and inter-sectoral coordination. The TSCAI would play an integral role to ensure coordination&#13;
between two components, and amongst various development partners that would avail their assistance to&#13;
implement the National Plan. The TSCAI, through special workmg teams, shall ensure regular monitoring&#13;
o f the program actiwties, effective coordinationbetween the sectors involved, among the EDPs, and with&#13;
civil society partners. GoN proposed that the Secretariat for the TSCAI would be locatedinthe Animal&#13;
Health Directorate under M o A C and relatedcosts for managingthe TSCAI coordination will be budgeted&#13;
under the Animal Health component; incase o f a pandemic, when the focus might shift more towards&#13;
human health, GoN would revisit this arrangement inclose consultation with the development partners.&#13;
Dunngimplementation, coordinationefforts and operational modalitiesdescribedbelow willbereviewed&#13;
and where necessary, appropriate adjustments would be made, to ensure that implementation i s effective&#13;
even ifan epidemic occurs. See Annex 5 for further details.&#13;
&#13;
Implementation: There will be two main implementing agencies -the Department o f Livestock Services&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(DoLS) and the Department o f Health Services (DoHS). Operational modalities for project&#13;
implementationare as follows:&#13;
&#13;
0   The Animal Health component (implemented by DoLS) and Human Health component (implemented&#13;
    byDoHS) would be treated as two separate sub-projects for the purpose o fadministrative and&#13;
    financial management requirements. Eachwill implement the components on communication and&#13;
    implementation/M&amp;E. Two designated accounts would be created, two project progress reports&#13;
    would berequired, and two separate audit reports would be required. However, they are part o f one&#13;
    integratedplan and the activities and work plans o f the two components will be closely coordinated&#13;
    bythe TSCAI.&#13;
&#13;
0   Any resources for activities to be implementedthrough another ministry,i.e. MoHA which is&#13;
    responsible for disaster management or the Ministryof Local Development (MOLD)which i s&#13;
    responsible for disaster preparedness at the district levels, would be included within the DoLS-&#13;
    implemented component. DoLS would be accountable to coordinate with other line ministnes for&#13;
    implementationo f activities through such rninistnes. For program implementationby other ministnes&#13;
    incaseofdisaster or outbreaks, DoLSwould channelrequiredresourcesto those ministnes. DoLS&#13;
    would ensure that programs to be implementedby those ministries are integrated inits work program&#13;
    and budget. DoLS would also ensure that they submit their progresses and statement o f accounts to&#13;
    DoLS so that overall progress managed by DoLS would be appropriately reportedand accounted.&#13;

FundFlow andDisbursementArrangements: DoLS and DoHS will prepare their Annual Work Program&#13;
and Budgets(AWPBs) for the respective Project components. Followingthe approval of the AWPBs by&#13;
the NationalPlanning Commission (NPC), the Ministryo f Finance (MoF) will release the budget.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Approved Project budgets for the animal health component and the human health components have&#13;
already been indicatedinthe public sector Estimates o f Expenditures (Red Book) under separate budget&#13;
headings. The IDA Grant will flow through two separate Designated Accounts, one for the animal health&#13;
component and the other for the humanhealth component. An effective monitonng and oversight system&#13;
including ex-ante and ex-post revlew will be put inplace to monitor the use of the compensahon fund to&#13;
ensure use o f funds for intended purpose. Disbursements will be made for: (i)  civil works, (ii) various&#13;
goods, including laboratory equipment, computers and vehicles; (iii)    consulting services; (iv) various&#13;
training, workshops, and study tours; and (v) incremental operating costs for project coordination.&#13;
&#13;
Financial Management: A Financial Management (FM) capacity assessment o fthe implementing&#13;
agencies (the DoLS and the DoHS) was carried out. The overall FMrisk is "substantial" as there are a&#13;
few cntical actions such as, staffing, preparation o f Operational Guidelines for use o f Compensation&#13;
Fund, computerization o fproject andfinancial information, andtraining of staff, that needs to be&#13;
implemented. Subject to satisfactory implementation o f these actions and review thereafter, the fiduciary&#13;
nskwillbereassessed. Ofthe two implementingagencies, DoHSisbetterpositionedwith slulledstaff&#13;
and experience inimplementing donor-financed programs. DoLS, on the other hand, would require&#13;
substantial efforts informing a strong team for project management which should include trained&#13;
financial management and procurement staff. Overall, there will be strong efforts incapacity building&#13;
both intechnical areas as well as overall project management which includes procurement and financial&#13;
management. Since the Project heavily depends on procurement tasks, it is important to ensure that both&#13;
Departments have sufficient capacity to carry out envisaged procurement o f works, goods and services.&#13;
T o address certain gaps that have been identified during the assessment, riskmitigation action plans have&#13;
been agreed. The existence o f the government's NAIIPPRPwhich was preparedjointly by M o A C and&#13;
MoHP, with strong support from development partners such as WHO and FAO, the formation o f an&#13;
Avian Influenza Technical Sub-Committee jointly chaired by two Secretaries o f M o A C and MoHP, and&#13;
the highprionty o f the government to implement this program are some factors that will also mitigate the&#13;
risks. The Project will fully align to the government's financial management system which includes&#13;
planning, budgeting, fund flow, accounting, reportingand auditing. Two sets o f annual project accounts&#13;
for DoLS and DoHS (including Statement o f Expenditures and the Designated Accounts) will be required&#13;
to be submitted, with audit reports due within six months ofthe end o f each fiscal year. DoHS will ensure&#13;
that project accounts o f the Component as per budget assigned to the specified project code. Project&#13;
progress reports will also be submitted separately for the two components on a tnmester basis.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement Arrangements: The summary o f the procurement capacity assessment o f the implementing&#13;
agencies i s presented inAnnex 7.Overall, the procurement risk i s rated as "medium"     -- the riskwillbe&#13;
reassessedas the implementing agencies implement agreed action plan for improvements on procurement&#13;
management. DoLS has very little capacity to undertake procurement as per Bankprocedures due to lack&#13;
o f trained and expenenced manpower. Even though DoHS i s currently involved inassisting in&#13;
implementation o fthe Nepal Health Sector Program, its performance has not been satisfactory due to a&#13;
similar paucity o f trained and experienced personnel. This, combined with the inherent overall weak&#13;
implementation capacity at boththe departments would require extensive capacity enhancement&#13;
measures. These include designating departmental staff as procurement officers who have been&#13;
specifically selected on the basis o fprevlous exposure to procurement; and ensuring that these officials&#13;
are trained inthe applicable procurement procedures. Inaddition to the procurement officer, each CCT&#13;
would hire a procurement consultant for the first year o f the project to prepare a procurement manual and&#13;
model documents and assist inconductingbiddingand bids evaluation and prepanngthe evaluation&#13;
reports, administenng contracts, monitoring procurement activities, maintaining a database o f ongoing&#13;
procurement actions and preparingup-to-date procurement status reports. Ifabsolutely necessary, the&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                                                       7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
services o f a procurement agent (e.g. specialized UNAgency or pnvate firm) may also be utilized to&#13;
assist both CCTs intheir procurement.&#13;
&#13;
Though a draft o f the country's own Procurement Law and relatedRegulations have been prepared, these&#13;
are yet to be enacted. Therefore, all ICB procurement shall be conducted as per the Bank's procedures&#13;
and usingthe Bank's applicable StandardBidDocuments. Procurement under NCB shall be undertaken&#13;
inaccordance withthe proceduresas described inthe Government's FinancialAdministration&#13;
Regulations with caveats on certain clauses to make these procedures acceptable to the Association, using&#13;
the model biddocuments developed by the Government for use inBank-fundedprojects.&#13;
&#13;
3. Monitoringand evaluation of outcomes/results&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring will take place on several levels o fmonitoring, i.e., overall program level (inter-sectoral) to&#13;
be done by the TSCAI, at the operational central level -by DoLS/DoHS, and at regional, district and&#13;
local levels -by the respective implementing arms o f the respective departments. The Project will use&#13;
information already produced by these levels and not create additionalreporting systems. The monitonng&#13;
system would measure the project progress based on the indicators includedinAnnex 2. The TSCAI will&#13;
review and monitor the overall program at least twice a year. Each line ministrywill monitor its&#13;
respective activities, and feed reports to the TSCAI. Similarly, regional, distnct and local-level&#13;
committees will monitor progress at their respective levels and feed the information upwards to the&#13;
TSCAI inaggregated formats to be designed and agreed upon. Findingsdenved fi-om overall program&#13;
monitoringby the TSCAI will be fed back to the other levels, thus ensuring a two-way flow o f&#13;
information and accountability. Monitoringreports will be shared with the external development partners&#13;
including the Bank, and biannualjoint review missions will be carried out to review these reports, and&#13;
agree on actions to be taken, including mid-course corrections, ifnecessary.&#13;
&#13;
Evaluationwould be done after two years (Mid-Term) and at the end o fthe project (after four and a half&#13;
years) usingngorous methods and independent evaluators. Sufficient resources for this are provlded for&#13;
inthe Project. Forthe evaluation to be meaningful, baselinedata onkeyindicators willneedto be&#13;
collectedbefore project activlties commence. However, certain emergency actions may become necessary&#13;
ifanoutbreak occurs andhence not allprojectactivities canwait for baseline data collection. The&#13;
evaluation o f emergency actions will essentially be interms o fpreventing or containing outbreaks - for&#13;
which the baseline would be zero (e.g. number o f cases, number o f outbreaks).&#13;

D. APPRAISAL SUMMARY&#13;
1. Economic andfinancial analyses&#13;
&#13;
Economic losses have already been significant inearly 2006, due to a precipitous fall inpoultry and egg&#13;
prices associated with reportedoutbreaks o f avian influenza inneighbouring India and concerns over&#13;
consumingpoultry meat and products inNepal. Prices for broilers decreased inMay 2006 by&#13;
approximately 50 percent from N R s . 120 to 60 per lulogram. Inthe case o f commercial broiler&#13;
production, the national stock o f commercial broilers i s estimated to be 32 million. Assuming an 8 week&#13;
productioncycle there would be 5.3 million broilers beingproduced at any one time. Assuming each&#13;
broiler weighs 1.5 lulograms, an outbreak o f avian influenza that caused a 50 percent reductioninprice&#13;
per kilogram, would result inas much as a N R s . o f477 million or US$6.8 million production cycle loss.&#13;
Inaddition, thelosstothebackyardpoultryproductionsystemownedbythemarginalfarmersand&#13;
landless who markets some 30 million indigenous table birds (valued higher inthe markets than broilers)&#13;
would threaten their livelihoods immensely. Inthe event o f an avian influenza outbreak within Nepal's&#13;
borders, the economic losses can be expected to be even more significant. Similarly, inthe event o f&#13;
human infection turninginto an epidemic, there would be significant loss o fhuman lives, including&#13;
productive labour, and economic impact o f human illness due to health care costs, lost days at work, and&#13;
indirect costs to the households concerned. Longterm benefits o f the Project, interms avoiding economic&#13;
losses, are expected to far outweigh the short term costs o f implementingthe Project.&#13;
&#13;
2. Technical&#13;
&#13;
The proposed Project involves a large set of technical issues involvingcapacity o fveterinary semces,&#13;
laboratory facilities, bio-security measures, epidemiological expertise, and emergency response to avian&#13;
influenza outbreaks and a possible pandemic. These technical issues are elaborated inAnnex 1(sector&#13;
issues) and Annex 3 (detailed project description).&#13;
&#13;
3. Fiduciary&#13;
&#13;
The decision to align with the government's systems and procedures for implementing both components&#13;
will contribute to enhancing institutional capacity. While the overall fiduciary nsk associated with the&#13;
Project i s rated as "substantial" for financial management and procurement, the proposed risk mitigation&#13;
action plans are deemed to be adequate (see Annex 6 and 7 for details). Efforts will be made for capacity&#13;
buildinginproject coordinationthat includes procurement and financial management.&#13;
&#13;
4. Social&#13;
&#13;
N o specific social safeguard i s triggered by the Project. However, incase o f outbreaks, the impact o f the&#13;
mandatory culling o f poultry and the consequent threat to livelihoods must be mitigated. InNepal, non-&#13;
commercial or backyardpoultry accounts for more than half o f the total poultry stock and it i s women and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
often children who are primarily involved inhusbandry related tasks such as collecting eggs and raising&#13;
and selling chicks. Inthe event o f an avian influenza outbreak inbackyardpoultry it i s women who will&#13;
be most likely affected by a loss o f income fkom the sale o f eggs and chicks inthe case o f culling, or more&#13;
senously, by contracting influenza inthe event o f transmission from poultry to humans. Women inrural&#13;
savings and credit groups, and such other income generating activities are involved inpoultry farming and&#13;
therefore special consideration for these women needs to be given for protection from the impact o f avian&#13;
influenza outbreaks. These social and gender issues will be dealt with inthe Project intwo specific ways:&#13;
byinvolving women invenfication o fculled poultry and compensation paymentmeetings; and through&#13;
ensuring careful targeting o f women and school children inthe communicationprogramme.&#13;
&#13;
5. Environmental&#13;
&#13;
The Avian Influenza Control Project i s assessedas a B-category project. Boththe Animal Health and&#13;
Human Health components have implications that trigger environmental safeguardpolicies. The disposal&#13;
o f culledpoultry, the clean up o f infected areas and control o f surrounding areas inthe case o f Animal&#13;
Health, and disposal o f laboratory and health care wastes inthe case o f HumanHealth, tngger the World&#13;
Bank SafeguardPolicy on Environmental Assessment. Measures will be taken to mitigate these&#13;
environmental impacts by requiring an EnwronmentalManagement Plan (EMP) be prepared for boththe&#13;
Animal Health and Human Health components. Inthe case o f the Human Health a Health Care Waste&#13;
Management Plan already exists under the Health Sector Program(June 2006) and this will form the basis&#13;
o f environment management for avian influenza activities as well (no separate EMPwill therefore be&#13;
prepared for the human health side). The Animal Heath EMP was finalized prior to appraisal and&#13;
submitted to the World Bank on June 26,2006. This EMPwas disclosed inNepal on August 1,2006 and&#13;
sent to the Infoshop on August 23,2006. Other than Environmental Assessment there are no safeguard&#13;
policies triggered.&#13;

(i) Production systems: Poultry farming inNepal takes place intwo distinct systems: (i) organized&#13;
                                                                                               an&#13;
commercialpoultry industrywith highyielding hybridlayers and broilers confinedmostly to large peri-&#13;
urban areas (45 percent o f all poultry), and (ii) backyardunits o f indigenous fowl and ducks inmillions o f&#13;
rural households across the country (55 per cent o f all poultry). Commercial poultry farming has been&#13;
developing fast over the last decade. These farms are concentrated around urban areas: most o f them (40&#13;
percent) inChitwan, Kathmandu, Pokhara and Biratnagar. The improved commercial birds (10.4 million)&#13;
are found exclusively inthe organized farms. Nepal imports parental stock o fpoultry primarily fi-om India&#13;
(447,000 broilers and 30,000 layers per year). Layers are o f Lehman and Hyline breeds and broilers,&#13;
Vencob, CoblOO, Cob500 and Marshall Breeds. Over 75 registered hatcheries operate inthe country. The&#13;
Department o f Livestock Services (DoLS) operates three farms inNepalgunj, Pokhara and Birgunj.&#13;
Astrolop and New Hampshirebreeds o fpoultry reared inGovernment farms are mostly for distribution&#13;
among farmers inthe hilly areas. Incontrast, backyardunits comprise fi-ee-ranging, foraging indigenous&#13;
birds (Sahni breed) which contribute to the livelihoods o fmillions o fpoor farmers. The holding size on&#13;
average i s five birds,but varies from two to twenty birds. Roughly half o frural households inNepal keep&#13;
indigenous fowl intheir backyards (12.65 million birds insome 3 millionhouseholds) spread over the 75&#13;
districts. Localbirdsare sturdy, resistant to most diseases, and survive mostly on foraging inback yards.&#13;
&#13;
(ii) Marketing system: Meat markets ingeneral and poultry markets inparticular are traditional and&#13;
unorganized inNepal. Traders visit organized farms and purchase birds at negotiated prices. Birdsare&#13;
thentransportedbyvans, motorbikes, andbicyclesto urbanareasand soldto consumers as dressed&#13;
chicken. InKathmandu, three pnvate agencies deal infrozen chicken but demand i s limited. Traders also&#13;
buy indigenous chicken from backyardpoultry unitsand sell them intowns andcities live or dressed.&#13;
Prices o f chickenvary from NR 80kg for live weight and NR 120kg for dressed chicken. Local breeds&#13;
fetch higher prices: up to NR 200kg live weight. Farmers also sell local chicken in some 1,450 village&#13;
haats (bazaars) and a small number in65 niche markets inurban areas, often inthe open air. There are no&#13;
organized markets for meat or live birds.There i s great demand for local chicken inurban areas where it&#13;
i s transported live and sold live or dressed. The practice o f transportation and sale o f live chickens i s one&#13;
o f the factors responsible for spread o f infectious diseases.&#13;
&#13;
(iii) Value chain in poultry sector: The poultry industryinNepal comprises organized poultry farms (256&#13;
o f varying flock size), hatcheries, and feed mills.Organised poultry farmers buy day-old chicks from&#13;
local hatcheries (35 million broilers and 2.5 million layers) as well as hatcheries inIndia for flock&#13;
replacement. Indigenous fowl inback yard unitsare self-generating and enable flock replacement through&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
home hatches. Feedmanufacturers supply feed, chicks, veterinary medicines and vaccines to farmers,&#13;
mostly on credit. Farmersreturn the loan out o f sale proceeds. 85 feed mills (small, all private) are located&#13;
in 16distncts andmanufacture about 600,000 MT ofpoultry feed annually. While maize, ncepolish, and&#13;
mustard cake are available locally, soybean extract and sunflower cake worth about NR 450 million are&#13;
imported from India. Poultry feed ispriced at about NR 18,000 per MT.There i s no organized pricing&#13;
mechanism for fixing prices o fbirds and eggs; pnces are determined between seller and buyer through&#13;
mutual negotiation. Nepal imports veterinary drugs and vaccines for poultry worth NR 725 million&#13;
annually.&#13;
&#13;
(iv) Slaughter houses; There are three slaughter houses inNepal locatedat Kathmanduand Hetauda.&#13;
None o fthese are functional for various reasons and thus slaughter o f chickens and other animals&#13;
continues to be carried out inthe traditional way: inthe open or inmake-shift shelters by over 600&#13;
butchers across Kathmandu. There i s no disposal mechanism for waste material inany o f the locations,&#13;
thus causing senous healthhazards. Inthe villages the slaughter o fbirdstakes place inhouseholds or in&#13;
village haats, invariably inthe open air.&#13;
&#13;
Capacity Assessment of LivestockInstitutions and Veterinary Services&#13;
&#13;
(i) Veterinarians: The Departmento f Livestock Services has inits Directorate o fAnimal Health a well-&#13;
knit veterinary infrastructure geared to undertake all activities contemplated inthe National Avian&#13;
Influenza and Influenza Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan (NAIIPPRP), bothinterms o fhuman&#13;
resources and equipment. The Directorate has a country-wide network o f vetennary institutions; one&#13;
central vetennary hospital, 75 district livestock service centres and 999 Livestock Service Centres and&#13;
Sub-centres provide animal health care, both curative and prophylactic. Inaddition, there are three other&#13;
Directorates handlingAnimal Production, Livestock Market Promotion, and Training &amp; Extension. All&#13;
four Directorates are grouped under the Director General inDoLS. There i s a CentralTraining Centre in&#13;
Kathmandu and five Regional Training Centres. Training programmes are regularly conducted for&#13;
officers, technicians and farmers. Five Regional Directors function under the Director General, DoLS:&#13;
one each inEastern, Central, Western, Mid-Western and Far-West Regions. Ineach district, there i s a&#13;
District Livestock Office supported by veterinary and livestock staff, livestock semce centres / sub-&#13;
centres, village animal health workers and farmers' groups. There are 178 veterinary officers, 1,000 para-&#13;
vetennary staff and 6,000 village animal health workers. Farmer groups are voluntary bodies, each having&#13;
about 20 farmers. Inaddition to the public sector's veterinary institutions, there are 160 pnvate&#13;
vetennarians and some 50 new veterinary graduates. There are also 46 retired veterinarians who canjoin&#13;
indungemergencies. Together, these groups shouldbe able to adequately contain outbreaks ofdisease.&#13;
&#13;
(ii) Professional associations and NGOs: Approximately 14associations o fpoultry farmers, hatcheries,&#13;
manufacturers o f feed, vetennary medicine and vaccines exist and are operating primarily to safeguard&#13;
their interests, but do provide semces to farmers to some extent. There are many NGOso fwhich fifteen&#13;
are active.&#13;
&#13;
(iii) Accreditation; Rinderpest and Owne Foot Rot have been eradicated and the programmes undertaken&#13;
inthis regardhave beenaccredited bythe WorldOrganisation for Animal Health(OIE). Expenence&#13;
gained inthose eradication programmes will be o f immense use inthe prevention and control o f avian&#13;
influenza. Compliance with fundamental principles o f quality o f the national vetennary service, as&#13;
defined by OIE, has yet to be carriedout.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     14&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(iv) Research infrastructure: All researchprogrammes relatedto agriculture and livestock fall under the&#13;
mandate o fthe Nepal Agncultural ResearchCouncil (NARC) which has research laboratories dealing&#13;
with vanous subjects under it.Departments under the MoAC identify projects for researchandrefer them&#13;
to NARC. Epidemiological investigationo f avian influenza i s being carried out by the Vetennary&#13;
Epidemiology Centre under the Animal Health Directorate. Samples from poultry from free-range&#13;
backyard farms around large water bodies and periphenes o f forests are tested periodically. Whenever&#13;
there i s death o f a bird, a thorough investigationi s carried out. Samples from commercial poultry farms&#13;
are routinely screened. So far, 1,800 samples from farms and field have been tested and all the samples&#13;
have been declared negative for avian influenza.&#13;
&#13;
Policy and Regulatory Framework in the Livestock Sector&#13;
&#13;
There are three Acts relevant to aman influenza: the Animal Health and Livestock Services Act 1998, the&#13;
Slaughter House and Meat InspectionAct 1998, and the Nepal Veterinary Council Act 1999. The&#13;
Vetennary Council Act deals mainly with registrationo f veterinarians and ethical conduct o f vetennary&#13;
practice. The Slaughter House and Meat InspectionAct regulate the slaughter o f animals and sale of meat&#13;
as well as inspection o f animals before and after slaughter. Provisions inthis act are seldom enforced. The&#13;
Animal Health and Livestock Act deals mainly with quarantine o f imported animals and animal products.&#13;
The Act lacks adequate provisions for empoweringvetennarians with suitable powers for control o f&#13;
contagious and infectious diseases. Inview o f the threat o f avian influenza, urgent action i s to be initiated&#13;
to amend the Act, and to establish effective enforcement mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
M o A C has been implementingthe National Contingency Plan for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza&#13;
since 20043,which details coordinationmechanisms and responsibilities. The contingency plan objectives&#13;
are: (i) to preventthe entrance o f HPAIinto the country; (ii) control avian influenza at the point o f&#13;
                                                                   to&#13;
entry inany possible case o f entry; and (iii)  to free the country from avian influenza.&#13;
&#13;
Most o f the commercial poultry farms have good bio-security arrangements. Some o f the steps adopted&#13;
are: isolation, traffic control, sanitation / hygiene, treatment / disposal, bio-containment and bio-&#13;
exclusion. Bio-security measures are moderate inlarge production units (&gt;I         ,000 birds),but seldom&#13;
practiced in smaller units and market places. National standards for breeding farmshatchenes have been&#13;
introducedby the Department o f Livestock Services. However, because o f the highinvestment cost in&#13;
establishingpoultry breeding farmshatcheries and highcost o f landrequired for appropriate bio-security,&#13;
these standards are not being followed stnctly.&#13;
&#13;
For non-commercial farms (free-range back yard units),these measures are difficult to enforce because o f&#13;
the widely scattered holdings across the country. A model for compartmentalization and zoning, incase&#13;
o f an outbreak, has been developed. Chechng o f trans-boundary movements o f animals i s a challenging&#13;
task because o f geographical location, free movement o f animals and people and lack o f adequate check&#13;
posts. This i s an area o f concern requinngurgent attention and will be addressed inthe proposed Project.&#13;
&#13;
Systems for reporting o f disease, communication andpublic information are inposition and worlung well.&#13;
A website on epidemiologicalreports (www.epivet.aov.np andwww.ahd.gov.np) has been opened.&#13;
Radio/TV programmes on livestock activities (two days a week), distribution o f brochures, posters and&#13;
calendars have started. Seminars and workshops are being held for departmental staff. Government has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 The contingency plani s the forerunner o f the National Avian Influenza and Influenza Pandemc Preparedness and&#13;
Response Plan (NAIIPPRP).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
issued directives that all livestock training programmes conducted inthe country shouldhave at least one&#13;
class on avian influenza. These have all resulted ina highdegree o f awareness among the professionals&#13;
and the general public. Long- term plans for restructuringo f the poultry industryhave not been attempted.&#13;
&#13;
B.HumanHealthSector&#13;
&#13;
Publichealthservice system&#13;
&#13;
The public health service delivery system o f MoHP is integrated and well established. It consists o f the&#13;
central ministry(DoHS) and five regional health directorates with a total o f 11regional and zonal&#13;
hospitals. There are also 75 distnct health offices and 68 district hospitals with an outreach network o f&#13;
188 primary health centers at the level o f the ilaka constituency, 698 healthposts at the village level, and&#13;
3,219 sub-health posts. Supporting this network are five central hospitals and a number o f private health&#13;
facilities including 10 private medical colleges. The total number o f inpatient beds inthe public health&#13;
care system i s 16,000. The humanresources o fthe medical colleges could be harnessed inthe event o f an&#13;
influenza pandemic.&#13;
&#13;
The laboratory infrastructure for diagnosis o f diseases o fpublic health significance i s limited. Peripheral&#13;
facilities can do basic microbiologic diagnostics (smears, grams stains, rapid kits for hepatitis and HIV).&#13;
The central laboratory National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL) does routine clinical tests&#13;
(haematology and chemistry), serologies for a variety o f diseases, and conventional Polymerase Chain&#13;
Reaction(PCR) as a researchtool. It cannot perform virologic tissue cultures. The Walter Reed Research&#13;
UnitNepal(WARUN), anaffiliate ofthe US.Armed ForcesResearchInstituteofMedicalSciences&#13;
(AFRMIS) inBangkok, has done specimen collection and testingfor influenza viruses, and does offer&#13;
referral support for Nepal. WARUN intends to expand its current capacity for influenza diagnostics by&#13;
developingrealtime PCR (RT PCR) testing. Inearly 2006, NPHLand WARUN developed a pilot project&#13;
for use o f rapid diagnostic h t s for influenza diagnosis inhospitals inKathmanduand Bharatpur, with&#13;
samples forwardedto AFRMIS for comparative testing with RT-PCR. This pilot system will serve as a&#13;
model for future project activities.&#13;
&#13;
For disease surveillance, several systems are currently operating inNepal. A basic data collection system&#13;
known as the Health Management Information System (HMIS) collects information on health care&#13;
utilization and diagnosis. It operates throughout the country, but HMIS data are o f limitedutilityfor&#13;
influenza surveillance due to a number o f factors. First, most diagnoses are clinical and are not supported&#13;
by standardized case definitions or laboratorydiagnostics. Second, information flow is sluggish, and data&#13;
are not analyzed or disseminated intimely fashion. Due to these limitations inspecificity and timeliness,&#13;
while HMIS data may be useful for monitoring long term trends, they are not for rapid detection o f cases&#13;
o f possible human illness due to avian influenza or outbreaks o f influenza-like illness.&#13;
&#13;
Several surveillance systems are inplace for diseases with specific control programs. These disease-&#13;
specific surveillance efforts are usually referredto as vertical programs. Examples include surveillance&#13;
programs for tuberculosis, leprosy, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and kala-azar. Inaddition to these vertical&#13;
surveillance systems, two integrated surveillance systems are inoperation. One i s the World Health&#13;
Organization (WHO) Programfor Immunization Preventable Diseases (IPD), which conducts&#13;
surveillance of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP)/poliomyelitis, measles, neonatal tetanus, and Japanese&#13;
Encephalitis (E).Surveillance o fHaemophilus influenzae type B (HiB) was recently added to the IPD&#13;
system. IPDhas 10 field offices throughout the country funded by donor resources. It has several&#13;
attributes that make it particularly attractive for awan influenza. For one, IPDruns an active weekly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       16&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
reporting system that covers 115 hospitals includingbothpnvate and public sector facilities. It also&#13;
receives passive reports from 465 public health system facilities. Overall, the IPD system covers 72% o f&#13;
primary health centers andjust under 5% o f healthposts and sub-health posts. Secondly, there i s an active&#13;
diagnostic specimen collection and transport system for any suspected case o f the diseases under&#13;
surveillance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The technical and implementation support o fUNAgencies would be sought as a last resort, incase GoN&#13;
capacity is constrained and the emergency nature o f the program does not permitthe approach ofbuilding&#13;
capacity first. Apart from the suggested role for UNICEF in the Communications component, WHO and&#13;
FA0are potentialpossibilitiesfor such support. Specifically, the surveillance activities to be supported&#13;
bythe IPDunit wouldbe a naturalcandidate for WHO assistance, as it is already being implementedwith&#13;
WHO support.&#13;
&#13;
The other national integrated surveillance system i s the Early Warning and Reporting System (EWARS).&#13;
Thishas beeninoperation since 1996and is runbythe Epidemiology and Disease Control Divisiono f&#13;
the Department o f Health Services (DoHS). It receives reports o f disease outbreaks or other unusual&#13;
health events from the 75 district public health offices, and receives weekly passive reports on AFP,&#13;
measles, Japanese encephalitis, malaria, and kala azar. EWARS operates in28 public hospitals. In2004,&#13;
the EWARS system reportednine outbreaks o f influenza-like illness comprising 5,065 cases and 57&#13;
deaths.&#13;

Actions against avian influenzataken to date by Ministry of Health and Population&#13;
&#13;
In2004, MoHPestablishedajoint agriculturalandhealthNationalInfluenzaTaskForceunderthe&#13;
chairmanship o f the Director General o fDoHS; this task force includes participation by private&#13;
organizations such as the Hatchery Association and the Consumer Forum. Under this task force the line&#13;
sectors o f MoHP and M o A Cjoined forces with FA0to develop the NAIIPPRP for strengthening&#13;
surveillance and control o f influenza. The NAIIPPRP aims at buildingpreparedness to contain AIrapidly&#13;
and mitigate its health and socioeconomic impacts inthe event o fhuman-to-human transmission o f H5N1&#13;
or other influenza sub-types which may cause a pandemic affectingNepal. To accomplish this goal, the&#13;
Plan calls for : (a) detecting and characterizing human influenza virus outbreaks promptly through the&#13;
MoHP outbreak surveillance system; (b) implementing an effective public healthresponse when an&#13;
influenzapandemic affects Nepal; (c) preparingthe health care delivery system to diagnose and treat&#13;
large numbers o fpeople with influenza and its complications; (d) implementing a timely communication&#13;
strategy that will inform the public on the status o f the pandemic inNepal and how to mitigate its impact,&#13;
and; (e) ensuring inter-sectoral and inter-governmental coordinationinpreparing and respondingto the&#13;
threat o f avian influenza and human infections.&#13;
&#13;
Health systemresponse&#13;
&#13;
The NAIIPPRPand Operational Plan describe key strategic activities required to ensure that the public&#13;
health and medical care network are well prepared to respond to the challenges o f avian and pandemic&#13;
influenza. They use WHO'Ssix global influenza pandemic phases along with the three broader WHO&#13;
pandemic penods (inter-pandemic, pandemic alert and pandemic). Five areas are defined for preparation&#13;
and response. Detailed strategic actions with time frames, responsible agencies, cost estimates and&#13;
indicators to measure the performance by these agencies are presented for each o f the three pandemic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        17&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
periods. The Plan indicates that as the pandemic progresses it i s essential to review the scope and role of&#13;
vanous sectors, including health and those involved innational disaster response.&#13;
&#13;
A timely and sensitive surveillance systemi s crucial to meetingthe public health challenges posedby&#13;
avian influenza. Recognizingthis, the GoNproposes covering two essential aspects: laboratory capacity&#13;
and epidemiologic monitonng. This i s underscored by the needto buildon the existing surveillance&#13;
infrastructure and adapting it to achieve systematic identification and reporting o f suspected avian&#13;
influenza and Influenza-like Illness (ILI)outbreaks, quality data analysis, interpretation, and&#13;
dissemination, and quality laboratory diagnostic support. The Operational Plan outlines key activities&#13;
required for strengtheningepidemiological and laboratory surveillance, including training needs at all&#13;
levels o f the health care system.&#13;
&#13;
(i) Laboratory strengthening: The Plancalls for strengthening the NPHLcentrallaboratory inthree&#13;
stages. Inthe first, short-term stage, laboratories will performrapid screening tests for influenza and any&#13;
positive samples will be collected, stored and transported to a pre-determined laboratory outside Nepal for&#13;
confirmatory testing. Inthe second, intermediate stage the focus will be on developing advanced testing&#13;
capacity especially Real Time   - Polymerase  Chain Reaction(RT-PCR) at NPHL.Inthe long-term third&#13;
stage, NPHLwill achieve Biosafety level 3 standards so that it will have the capacity for influenza virus&#13;
isolation. This three-staged laboratoryupgrading approach will not only enhance preparedness for awan&#13;
and pandemic influenza, but will buildoverall laboratory capacity for other priority emerging infectious&#13;
diseases inNepal.&#13;
&#13;
(ii) Casediagnosis and reporting: A fully integrated surveillance system i s the ultimate goal o fthe&#13;
MoHP, including influenza monitoring. The national plan calls for accomplishingthis by buildingon the&#13;
existing EWARS system for national influenza surveillance, training surveillance personnel indisease&#13;
surveillance for avian influenza, improving information technology, and enhancing the capacity o f district&#13;
and nationalrapidresponse teams to conduct investigations related to influenza.&#13;
&#13;
(iii) Information, education and communication: The option exists to tap into the existing national&#13;
communication strategy, which has been uses successfully for other emergent public health&#13;
circumstances, such as polio vaccination campaigns. This strategy i s designed to buildpartnerships with&#13;
the media, involve communities inpreparedness planning and response, and improve capacity and&#13;
procedures for risk communication. InNepal, there are four TV stations, two public and several pnvate&#13;
radio stations, six daily newspapers, and thirty-six weeklies with estimated 70% combined geographic&#13;
coverage. Strengthening partnerships with the media can further enhance communication for nsk&#13;
mitigation.&#13;
&#13;
C. The NationalStrategic and OperationalPlansfor AddressingAvianInfluenzainNepal&#13;
&#13;
Strategic Plan: The National Avian Influenza and Influenza Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan&#13;
(NAIIPPRP) was preparedjointly by MoHP and MoAC, with support from WHO and FAO, and was&#13;
cleared by GONinDecember 2005.&#13;
&#13;
Ittakes account o fthe six phases o fthe awan influenzapandemic related periods, and outlines five&#13;
strategic areas for preparation and response to pandemic influenza, within which specific activities will be&#13;
undertaken. These are: planning and coordination, surveillance, prevention and control, health system&#13;
response and communication. The NAIIPPRParticulates common short-term and long-term objectives&#13;
across both the animal and human health sectors for responding to the threat o f avian influenza.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      18&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Communication strategies have been developed for providing essential messages to key actors involved&#13;
as well as the general population on the nature o fthe threat and how the country plans to respond. A bnef&#13;
work plan and budget estimate (of approximately US$ 15 million) was also presented.&#13;
&#13;
Followingrelease o fthe NAIIPPRP, several activities took place inearly 2006. As a result, a great deal o f&#13;
awareness has been created at all levels, among policy-makers, professionals and general public.&#13;
Protective materials (PPE) for professionals were purchased out o f government and USAID funds. All&#13;
legislation systems relatedto the livestock sector have been reviewed and areas requinng immediate&#13;
acbon have been listed. Donor agencies expressed interest in supportingNepal inthe avlan influenza&#13;
programs. FAO/OIE sponsoredM o A C staff to attend internationalworkshops on AI inVietnam and&#13;
Bangkok. The M o A C has intensified the veterinary inspection system and seized illegally imported ducks&#13;
and destroyed them. The quarantine system was restructured.&#13;
&#13;
Operationalplan: Becausethe NAIIPPRPi s strategic innature, an Operational Planhas been developed&#13;
bythe GoNto translate the strategic concepts into measurable activities. This Operational Planforms the&#13;
basis for activlties to be conducted under the World Bank funded project, althoughthe Bank will not&#13;
necessarily finance 100percent o fthe Operational Plan's activities. Furthermore, the Operational Plan i s&#13;
considered to be a "living document" which will be reviewed and revised periodically by the TSCAIas&#13;
required.&#13;
&#13;
For the animal health section, the Operational Plan is divided into seven components. These include: (i)&#13;
strengthening the disease surveillance systemfor influenza; (ii)  strengthening quarantine services; (iii)&#13;
upgradinglaboratory capacity; (iv) field veterinary services; (v) a compensation fund; (vi)&#13;
communications; and (vii) management. Each o f the components is described inmore detail inAnnex 3.&#13;
For the human health section, the Operational Plan i s divided into five components. These include: (i)&#13;
strengthening the disease surveillance system and laboratory capacity for influenza; (ii)prevention and&#13;
containment measures (iii)   health care delivery systempreparedness and response; (d) communications;&#13;
and (e) management. Eacho f the components i s described inmore detail inAnnex 3.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
COMPONENT 1:Animal Health&#13;
&#13;
Sub-component 1.1:Surveillance&#13;
&#13;
(a) Surveillanceand epidemiologicalinvestigationof domestic poultry: This is the mechanism for&#13;
early warning and diagnosis o f HPAIincidence inNepal. Caged birds inorganised poultry farms are not&#13;
inany direct threat ofinfectionfrom the migratorybirds,unless contaminatedpeople, material or infected&#13;
birdscome into contact with the farm flocks inadvertently. Onthe other hand, fowl and ducks inback&#13;
yards are free-ranging birdsunrestrained duringthe day and are constantly exposed to possible fecal&#13;
infection from migratory birds contaminating the land corridors under their fly ways, particularly during&#13;
migration seasons (end September-December and April-May).&#13;
&#13;
The project proposes surveillance o f backyardpoultry with the Regions as the basic unit and sampling&#13;
frames randomly drawn from within each Region. The sample frame and size will be determined by the&#13;
Epidemiological Centre and the sample frame changed each month. The total number o f samples&#13;
proposed for national random sero-sampling programme o f backyardpoultry for a year is 4,000 dunngall&#13;
four years o f Project implementation. There are about 250 organisedpoultry farms inNepal with widely&#13;
diffenng flock size, but mostly concentrated ina few selected distncts. The Epidemiological Centre will&#13;
randomly choose the farms and the sampling frame within farms and also determine the number o f&#13;
samples or specimens to be collected. The total number o f samples for farm flocks will be 6,000 per year.&#13;
&#13;
Surveillance o f migratory birds intheir natural habitats is impractical: dead wildbirds are ideal for H5N1&#13;
virus confirmationbut inrealtime situations, it is rare to find dead birds,even intheir habitats or&#13;
sanctuaries. Collection o f samples from live migratory birds i s technically difficult and undesirable as it&#13;
would disturbthe entire migratory birdpopulation.&#13;
The frequency o f samplinginall cases will be once every two months dmng the months o f June to&#13;
September and January to March; and once a month during September - January and April - M a y (the&#13;
migration seasons). The actual sample collection will be carned out in all casesby the technicianin&#13;
charge o f the Livestock Services Development Centres (LSDCs) under the direction and technical&#13;
guidance o f the DLSO chief or the wild life technicians (incase o f sentinels) personally once ina month&#13;
or once every two months, as the case may be, from the sampling frame falling within hisjurisdiction and&#13;
on the same day for all samples allotted to him.The samples or specimen collected would include blood&#13;
(serum) samples as well as tracheal and cloacal swabs. The samplingtechnician will pack the samples and&#13;
specimens inbio-safety packages with gel packs for cold chain and the Surveillance SupervisionTeam o f&#13;
the regional directorate, for the area, will despatch the packages to the designatedRegional Veterinary&#13;
Laboratory through special messengers.&#13;
&#13;
Timeframefor surveillance &amp; epidemiological investigations: February 2007 - July 2011&#13;
&#13;
@) Participatory diseaseintelligence:Many Nepalese villages are difficult to reach except from the sky:&#13;
H5N1 infectivematerial may reachthemthrough the migratory birds flying overhead. These villages are&#13;
used to regular birdmortality, sometimes invery large numbersbecause o fthe recumngravages o f&#13;
Newcastle Disease. IfH5N1 infection erupts and ifbirds start dying inthese villages they may be&#13;
construed as deaths due to NewcastleDisease. Cases o f human H5N1 influenza in such villages may&#13;
therefore never be recognised as such or attributed to diseases o fpoultry. With a captive constituency o f&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       24&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
village Animal Health Workers and farmer members o f the farmer groups DoLS can effectively use them&#13;
as the communication channel both ways, establishing "Disease Intelligence".&#13;
&#13;
Nepal has some 6,000 village animal health workers attached to the LSDCs and also several commodity&#13;
(affinity) farmer groups attachedto these institutions. The village Animal Health Workers and Farmer&#13;
Affinity Groups constitute the participatorydisease intelligencegroups and wouldbe vigorously&#13;
encouraged to report on birdmortality, sickness amongbackyard fowl and ducks to LSDCs and districts.&#13;
Some 6,000 Animal Healthworkers and 10,000 farmer members o f the commodity (affinity) groups&#13;
attached to the LSDCs will be exposed to one-day Village Based Training (VBT) carried out inthe&#13;
villages (inone village for a cluster o f five nearby villages) by trained technicians inthe LSDCs intheir&#13;
respective areas: the VBTs will for 4,000 participants annually (one per village development committee)&#13;
and repeated every year duringthe four year project period.&#13;
&#13;
Timeframefor completing VBTs: February 2007 June 2007 for batch 1and every year thereafter.&#13;
                                                     -&#13;
&#13;
(c) Capacity-buildingof veterinary professionals, poultry entrepreneursandwildlife professionals&#13;
for surveillanceand bio-safety: To monitor and manage the massive national random sero-surveillance&#13;
o f domestic poultry and migratory birds; and to enforce the bio-safety regulations (to be set up) by the&#13;
GoN, the Project proposes to train, in2-day district level workshops, all veterinary professionals and&#13;
para-professionals inthe country along with wild life technicians involved with migratory birdhabitats.&#13;
These training workshops will cover 500 veterinary professionals, 2500 para-vets, 500 poultry&#13;
entrepreneurs and some 100 wildlife technicians (4,100 inall). Course contents will include: general&#13;
awareness about HPAI, need for personal bio-secunty safeguards for professionals dealing with the&#13;
disease, random sero-surveillance, samples and specimens to be collected, hand-onpractice in&#13;
samplehpecimen collection, bio-secunty and safety regulations for poultry farms and certification o f&#13;
poultry farms annually on bio-security levels pracbsed, prevention, control, and containment of HPAI,&#13;
equipment required for surveillance and containment including Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).&#13;
&#13;
Timeframe for workshops: One 2-day workshop will be organised ineach o f the 75 districts by&#13;
December 2007.&#13;
&#13;
(d) Developmentof GIs-based animal disease surveillanceand information system: DoLS currently&#13;
has a disease information system electronically enabled, but it i s confined to the Epidemiological Centre&#13;
o fthe Animal Health Directorate. Inorder for the massive random sero-surveillance programme under the&#13;
Project to work effectively it is essential to establish a nation- wide, dynamic information system and&#13;
network electronically enabled, GIs-based and GPS-centnc. The DoLS therefore must structure a disease&#13;
surveillance and containment programme usingsatellite imagery and GIS Data Systems. The network&#13;
should link the Nodal Animal Health Group responsible for HPAIControl and Containment inthe&#13;
DoLS's Directorate o f Animal Health, the laboratory system, the animal quarantine system; the&#13;
Departmento fNational Parks and Wildlife Conservation, and inparticular the newly proposedB S L 3&#13;
Laboratory. The hub o f the network would be inthe Epidemiological Centre. The proposal for a system&#13;
involvingsatellite imagery o f water bodies and wet lands, mapping o fthe land corridors beneath the&#13;
major fly ways, a GIs-based, GPS-enabled, animal disease intelligence/ information system including&#13;
equipping the system and training and runninginthe system over a three-year period will be designed by&#13;
a competent consultant.&#13;
&#13;
The Regional Directors will be fully responsible for the implementation, supermion and control o f the&#13;
national random sero-surveillance o f domestic poultry and migratory birds; the Regional Directorates will&#13;
set up Mobile Surveillance Supervision Teams: one ineach Region. The Project for this purpose provides&#13;
for strengthening o f the Regional Directorates. The LSDCs, quarantine check-posts, and wildlife&#13;
technicians will continue sero-surveillance without interruption, under the supervision o f the Surveillance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       25&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Supervision Teams. The laboratory system, suitably upgraded under the Project, will receive the serum&#13;
samples from the sero-surveillance programme and analyse them usingagreed protocols. Suspected&#13;
samples and specimens will immediately be sent to the dedicated HPAILaboratory (BSL 3) for diagnosis&#13;
and possible confirmation o f H5N1 or other HPAIvirus strains. The Epidemiology Centre will design the&#13;
sample frame and sample size for the sero-surveillance and will be intouch with the Regional and Central&#13;
Veterinary Laboratories for monitonng the sero-surveillance programme. The Epidemiology Centre with&#13;
suitable consultancy assistance will structure a GIS / GPS based Animal Disease Information System with&#13;
nodes inall eight laboratories, the Animal Health Directorate and with the Epicentre inthe&#13;
Epidemiological Centre.&#13;
&#13;
Timeframefor establishing and making the system operational: February 2007 February 2008&#13;
                                                                                    -&#13;

Sub-component 1.2: Preventionand Containment&#13;
&#13;
The quarantine border check-posts and the quarantine patrol teams will seal the borders incase outbreaks&#13;
o f HPAIoccur inthe neighbouring districts inIndia and China. These posts will seize all intruding&#13;
materials like feed, food grains, live birds, poultry or other animal products. They will draw samples and&#13;
specimens from the seized flocks or carcases as the case may be and send them inbio-safety packs with&#13;
cold chain to the laboratories. They will also disinfect or fumigate the infected premises and materials.&#13;
&#13;
The Project therefore includes strengthening o f the animal quarantine infrastructure inNepal: including&#13;
expanding physical facilities inthe four existing check-posts: cold roodfumigationroom, incinerators;&#13;
spraying and fogging equipment and communication equipment for all 24 check posts, four wheel drive&#13;
pick-up vans for the eight Quarantine Patrol Teams, and 75 motor-cycles for the.24 check-posts. Finally,&#13;
the project will finance four years o f operational costs (quarantine consumable, maintenance and&#13;
propulsion costs o f vehicles, and travel allowances o f the teams) for the eight teams.&#13;
&#13;
Timeframe for strengthening checkposts and QuarantinePatrol Teams: July 2006 - July 2007&#13;
&#13;
Sub-component 1.3: LaboratoryCapacity&#13;
&#13;
Nepal has eight animal disease diagnostic laboratories inthe country: the Central Veterinary Laboratory&#13;
(CVL) ,five RegionalVeterinary Laboratories (RVLs), NationalAvian Disease InvestigationLaboratory&#13;
(NADL)1,andtheFMD/TADsLaboratory. The scientific manpoweravailable inthe laboratorysystem&#13;
i s meagre, except inthe CVL. Regional laboratones do not have the needed equipment. Procedures&#13;
followed are satisfactory but financial constraints do not allow staff to implement all bio-safety&#13;
procedures. The laboratory buildingsneed some repairs or additions to suit the changingneeds. There i s&#13;
no HPAIdedicated laboratory inNepal. The Veterinary Epidemiology Centre under the Animal Health&#13;
Directorate i s carrying out epidemiological investigationo f avian influenza. G o N has proposed&#13;
strengthening disease intelligence and surveillance by enhancement and upgrading o f one existing animal&#13;
diagnostic investigation laboratory to B S L 3 and the seven laboratories (CVL, five RVLs,and NADIL)to&#13;
BSL 2 for facilitating surveillance under the NAIIPPRF'. The BSL 3 laboratory will be established as an&#13;
adjunct to the FMD/ TAD laboratory as the objectives of the BSL 3 lab overlap with those o f TAD lab&#13;
with a stand alone services block. The CVL, NADLand the five RVLswill be suitably strengthenedfor&#13;
shanng the work load o fthe B S L 3 Lab. Several basic concepts inbiological safety and security; and&#13;
guidelines to develop codes o fpractice are described inthe WHO Laboratory Safety Manual 2004 and&#13;
similar manual(s) by OIE, for the safe handling o fhighlypathogenic micro-organisms inlaboratones.&#13;
Strict adherence to these guidelines will be followed to establish a safer work environment for laboratory&#13;
staff and the surrounding community.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      26&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
A well-organized network o fdiagnostic laboratories forms the basis for the successful surveillance o f&#13;
avian influenza virus and other infectious diseases. To overcome the shortcomings and to improve the&#13;
laboratory testing system, it i s necessary to utilize all the above laboratories by networking them and&#13;
decentralizing the activities related to diagnosis o fHPAI.This national laboratory network will follow&#13;
guidelines andrecommendations o fthe OIE/FAOnetwork (OFFLU). While networkmg the laboratories&#13;
the responsibilities o fthe national laboratory network for diagnosis and active surveillance will be revised&#13;
to share the work load and to reduce turn-around time. The eight district labs locatedinthe areas o fthe&#13;
eight refurbished quarantine check posts would also be modestly updated to share the network tasks. For&#13;
the setting up o fthe B S L 3 Laboratory and to streamline the networkmg o f the other labs, technical&#13;
assistance and consultancy services will be necessary. The costs for the laboratory capacity-building&#13;
include such costs as well (see below).&#13;
&#13;
The Project Coordinator DoLS will be responsible for initiating and coordinating the strengthening and&#13;
capacity buildingo f the veterinary laboratories, including the establishment of the B S L 3 Laboratory. H e&#13;
or she will structure the networking o f the eight laboratones that are upgraded (discussed above) and re-&#13;
equipped under the Project.&#13;
&#13;

Sub-component 1.4: FieldVeterinary Services&#13;
&#13;
Nepal's containment and control strategies for HPAIoutbreaks indomestic poultry follow OIE/ FA0&#13;
Guidelines and were formulated with the active participation o fthe WHO and FA0FieldOffices in&#13;
Kathmandu. DoLS has issued guidelines to the Regional Directorates and Distnct Livestock Offices for&#13;
micro-planning and getting ready their own control and containment set up. DOLS currently oversees the&#13;
operations and coordinates the containment activities, while the DistnctNatural Disaster Relief&#13;
Committees working with the District Administration and the Distnct Livestock Officer executes the&#13;
containment programme. All through the containment operations district Public Health Teams are to be&#13;
present inthe infected zones and take care o f house-to-house surveillance for identifying human&#13;
infections/ suspected infections ifany.&#13;
&#13;
The Planprovides for Rapid Response Teams (RRT) o f veterinary professionals supported by para-vets in&#13;
the DoLS, shlled workers for culling o fbirds, workers for disinfection, sanitation, buryingkilledbirds/&#13;
burningin-contact birdfeed, stock pileso feggs andother materials, disposal o faccumulatedbirdlitter&#13;
&#13;
cases o f outbreaks some 10 -15 days untilthe all clear i s sounded. The Operational Planproposes training&#13;
and scores o f other tasks that accompany a control and containment operation which lasts inordinary&#13;
&#13;
and equipping one RRT for each distnct inthe country: there are 75 districts together inall the districts&#13;
and so 75 RRTs. The RRTs will undergo a one day full dress rehearsal simulation exercise at their&#13;
respective district head quarters and all training will be completedby end 2007. The training o f RRTs will&#13;
involve some 1,200 persons together for all the 75 distncts. The Projectwill also support strategic&#13;
reserves o f essential equipment for stock piling: PPE, fogging machines and vaccination equipment&#13;
constitute the list o f equipment: and quantities are based on the assumption o f 30 outbreaks ina year. In&#13;
the second and thirdyear the requirement will only be PPEs, as they plan repeat use o f fogging machines&#13;
and vaccination equipment.&#13;
&#13;
Project implementationenvisages the Regional Director o f Livestock Semces to be fully responsible for&#13;
the implementation, supervision and control o f the National Random Sero-surveillance o f domestic&#13;
poultry, the free rangingbackyard birds as well as organised farm flocks and the migratory birds intheir&#13;
wet land/ water body habitats. The Project for this purpose provides for strengthening the Regional&#13;
Directorates and enabling the Directorateto set up Mobile Surveillance SupervisionTeams: one in each&#13;
Region.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        27&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The Distnct Livestock Offices, suitably strengthened under the Project, will arrange for the distnct level&#13;
training workshops (one ineach district) for orienting all professional staff o f the DoLS / Wild Life&#13;
Technicians on HPAI/ Random Sero-surveillance and complete their training duringthe current year:&#13;
2006. The DLSO will also proceed on war footing to train and equip the Rapid Response Teams (RRT)&#13;
for disease control and containment, one each for all distncts, with teams kept incombat readiness before&#13;
the end o f 2006 inall districts.&#13;
&#13;
The DLSO will be the prime mover for launching the control and containment campaign, once an&#13;
outbreak o f HPAIH5N1 i s announced by the Central Vetennary Laboratory and/ GoN. The DLSO will&#13;
mobilise the RRTs, alert local authorities, the district administrationand the national HPAIcoordination&#13;
set up.H e will coordinate with the help o fthe district administrationthe inspection, culling and&#13;
destruction o f infected or possible infected flocks, feed, and eggs stock pile. H e will enforce all zoo-&#13;
sanitary measures (restriction inmovement o f humans, material, live poultry, birdlitter, manure, feed and&#13;
poultry products) and fumigate infectedpremises. H e will cordon o f fthe areas inthe infectedzone 0-3&#13;
kmradius andthe surveillance zone (bufferzone) o f3-10kmradius untilthe outbreak hasbeen stamped&#13;
out. The DLSO will also arrange for compensation for birds, feed stocks and eggs stocks actually&#13;
destroyed.&#13;
&#13;
Timeframe for completepreparedness: February 2007 -July 2007&#13;
&#13;
Sub-component1.5: CompensationFund&#13;
&#13;
DoLS had two rounds o f discussions with a cross section o f backyardpoultry farmers and representatives&#13;
o f the poultry industryon issues related to compensation and rehabilitation incase culling and destruction&#13;
o fpoultry becomes necessary inthe face o f an HPAIoutbreak. The consensus arrived at deals with the&#13;
scope and quantum o f compensation for birds, egg stocks, and feed stocks destroyed dunng containment&#13;
and control campaigns, as well as possible support for rehabilitation.&#13;
&#13;
While compensation would be essential to encourage farmers to report suspicious birdsand ensure that&#13;
they can recover their flock, there may not be a case for rehabilitation.Backyard poultry farmers incur no&#13;
investments on their flock except for the value o f the birds (often home bred), nor do they have any&#13;
recurring expenses on their flocks as they are free-ranging birds foraging and fending for themselves.&#13;
Backyardbirds seldomreceive hand feeding, except for a fistful o f lutchen waste. Farmers invariably&#13;
shelter them inlarge bamboo baskets or make-shift coops duringthe night. Ifthe backyardpoultry&#13;
farmers are paid a fair compensation to cover the value o f the birds destroyed, that would be more than&#13;
adequate to make up for their losses, actual as well as potential. They seldom stock eggs or feed. Inthe&#13;
case o f organised poultry farms, the farmer loses only the current flocks incase o f a mandatory culling&#13;
programme. The current flock value ina poultry farm, layer or broiler, seldom exceeds 20 per cent o f the&#13;
total investments for the farm. Therefore there i s little need for rehabilitation inthe case o f organised&#13;
poultry farmers. Compensating for loss o f flocks, egg stocks, and feed stocks at prevailing market prices&#13;
should be adequate to cover their losses.&#13;
&#13;
It is importantto determine a fair and effective value for culledbird.The marketprice o f an indigenous&#13;
(backyard) birdi s higher than the market price o fbroilers and currently the price for an indigenous bird&#13;
for meat i s NRs.150 200. Farmers, however, would probably accept a compensation rate at a flat rate&#13;
                      -&#13;
equal to halfthe marketprice of an adult indigenous bird, say NRs.100 per bird, as they would invariably&#13;
bringina mixed flock o fbirdsmade upo f all age groups for culling (adults amongthembeing about a&#13;
third). So the birds destroyed valued at Rs.100per birdand for all birds culled from his flock, is&#13;
considered a fair rate o f compensation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       28&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
DoLS has not yet amved at a sound basis for calculating the compensation fund for budgetingpurposes.&#13;
A practical and sound basis would be the poultry population density inthe infecteddistnct (calculated on&#13;
the basis o fthe district poultry census and its area). Usingthe density inthe district, the DoLS can&#13;
calculate the birdpopulation within the 10 kmradius o f infected and surveillance zones. As there is&#13;
considerable vanation between districts inthe density o fpoultry population, the population density o f the&#13;
infected district i s the most appropriate basis for calculation.&#13;
&#13;
Inthe case ofthe organisedpoultry farms compensation isbasedonactual numbers culled. The market&#13;
price for broilers inNepal i s N R s . 80 per kg live weight or N R s . 120 per bird.It i s therefore appropriate to&#13;
assume average compensation for farm flocks at NRs.100 per bird, regardless o f weight, age, or breed.&#13;
The only exception to this rule would be culled parental stock which wouldbe compensated at NRs. 500&#13;
per birdas they are expensive and cost over N R s . 1,200 per headto procure.&#13;
&#13;
For purposes o fbudget estimates the assumptions used are: 30 possible outbreaks per year, each outbreak&#13;
needingculling o f some 50,000 adult equivalents o fbirds and valued at N R s . 100per bird, works out to&#13;
NRs.0.62 millionover 3 years. The cost o f egg stocks and feed stocks may be another NRs.0.42 million.&#13;
Together, the total estimated budget for compensation i s estimated at U S $ 1.04 million. This figure,&#13;
however, is a very rough estimate that cannot possibly accurately predict the likely number o f birds to be&#13;
culled. It will therefore have to be adjusted duringProject implementation.&#13;
&#13;
On the basis o fthe regulatorymeasures proposed inthis Project it seems appropriate to bnnginan&#13;
element of moralhazard incompensation payments to organisedpoultry farms. Farms have to comply&#13;
withthe GoN's mandatory bio-securitynorms andbe certified for the bio-security level maintained&#13;
annually, by industryinspectors, and based on the government prescribed norms. Ifthe farms being culled&#13;
do not have a certificate o f the standard of bio-security it follows at prescribed levels, it would not be&#13;
eligible for any compensation.&#13;
&#13;
Another aspect to be examined i s the registrationo f all larger farms as mandated by the governments. It&#13;
should be possible to include inthe registrationfee a small contribution to an industry-driven (permanent)&#13;
Compensation Fund.This will make the industrymore open to disease reporting and will enable them to&#13;
cooperate with the authorities inmatters pertaining to the public good.&#13;
&#13;
COMPONENT2: HumanHealth&#13;
&#13;
Sub-component 2.1: Surveillance and Laboratory Strengthening&#13;
&#13;
The main goal o f this component i s to develop the surveillance capacity withinNepal to detect: (i)       the&#13;
presence o f human avian influenza cases as they occur; (ii)    and to monitor and investigate the&#13;
epidemiology o f influenza and influenza-like illnesses to identify changes intransmission patterns o f&#13;
avian or other novel influenzaviruses; (iii)   and be able to track the impact o f an influenza pandemic&#13;
should it occur. The ultimate goal s to inform decision-making by Nepali and internationalhealth&#13;
authorities duringthe different pandemic phases and to guide the prompt and long-term interventions&#13;
needed to contain or delay the spread o fthe disease.&#13;
&#13;
The actions inthis sub-component will strengthen the existing disease surveillance capacity o f the public&#13;
health system o fNepal at the district, regional, and national level so that i s able to runa functional&#13;
influenza surveillance system, set up such surveillance buildingon existing mechanisms, and design and&#13;
prepare the surveillance tools and methods required to monitor the occurrence o f this disease over the&#13;
different phases o f the pandemic. This requires strengthening and expanding current capacities indata&#13;
collection, case investigation, and laboratory diagnostics. Successful implementation of activities to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       29&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
strengthen influenza surveillance will benefit the overall surveillance and control infrastructure inthe&#13;
country for priority diseases and for known and emerging health threats.&#13;
&#13;
Enhance capacity of district and regional rapid response teams&#13;
&#13;
InNepal, epidemiologc investigationsareconductedthroughanetworkofrapidresponseteams (RRTs)&#13;
based at the district level. Each o f the 75 distncts has the ability to field one or more (RRTs), whose&#13;
number varies based on the circumstances and needs o f eachparticular investigation. RRT members at the&#13;
district level are healthproviders (e.g. physicians, nurses) or allied healthprofessionals (e.g. sanitanans)&#13;
usually engaged inroutine clinical or public health activities. Their skills and training to conduct&#13;
epidemiologic investigations and analyze and report their findings are variable. When necessary, the&#13;
distnct level RRTs are backed up by teams from the regional or national level. These teams generally&#13;
have better capacity and training, and when not involved ininvestigations they engage incollecting,&#13;
analyzing, and reporting routine surveillance data. The regional teams also include personnel who can&#13;
assist wth collection o f clinical specimens for laboratory analysis. At present there are five regional&#13;
RRTs.The Project will support strengthening o fthe existing RRTnetwork through training andbetter&#13;
equippingthese teams. It will also expand the regional RRT network by adding three additional teams for&#13;
backup support. To do this, teams and surveillance cells will be established at BPK Institute o f Health&#13;
Science inthe eastern region; Nepalgunj Medical College inthe western region, and at the national&#13;
surveillance node (Epidemiology and Communicable Disease Control (EDCD)unidNationa1Public&#13;
Health Laboratory (NPHL) for the central region. Any time a human case o f avian influenza i s suspected&#13;
or confirmed one or more o f the regional response teams will take over the investigation. The regional&#13;
RRTswill also conduct field investigations any time avian influenzai s detectedinpoultry. The purpose&#13;
o f these investigations will be to survey humanpopulations inthe area o f the poultry outbreak and to&#13;
assess the potential for disease among those engaged inculling and other outbreak control measures.&#13;
&#13;
Guidelines for the conduct o f case and outbreak investigations related to avian influenza and influenza-&#13;
like illness will be developed. Once the guidelines are available, the district and regional RRTs will be&#13;
trained on how to utilize these guidelines. Periodic refresher training will also be conducted as&#13;
membership on the teams i s likely to change over time and new information concerning avian influenza&#13;
becomes available. As the surveillance system matures and more possible cases and outbreaks are&#13;
identified, it i s expectedthat eachteam will have to conduct more investigations. The project will support&#13;
these investigations, including expenses to travel to the field and specimen collection and transport, and&#13;
proper protective measures (personal protective equipment, vaccination, and antivirals) for the regional&#13;
teams. RRTswill have rapid diagnostic kits available to establish a preliminary diagnosis inthe field. The&#13;
costs for the luts are included inthe laboratory component. For costing purposes, it i s expectedthat each&#13;
district team will conduct three investigations inthe first 12-month period o f the project, four inthe&#13;
second, and five inthe next two 12-month periods. They will require back-up support from regional teams&#13;
on average 40 times per year (when all five teams are fully functional, eight investigations per year per&#13;
team).&#13;
&#13;
Influenza-like illness reporting with an embedded laboratory algorithm through the Early WarningAlert&#13;
and ResponseSurveillance (E WARS) network&#13;
&#13;
The current EWARS network consists o f 28 sentinel sites, mostly located inthe Tarai region o f southern&#13;
Nepal. This network can be harnessed to conduct surveillance o f influenza-like illness (LLI), allowing the&#13;
country to establish systematic baseline rates o f the occurrence o f LIand the seasonal and epidemiologic&#13;
patterns. This would allow rapid recognition o f aberrations inthe normal occurrence o f disease which&#13;
would thenbe investigatedby the rapid response teams. T o be most beneficial, this ILIsurveillance will&#13;
be coupledto an embedded algorithm for collection of specimens for laboratory testing, providing data on&#13;
the types o f influenza strains circulating inthe country and the seasonal patterns. It will also allow the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       30&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
laboratory network to remain proficient ininfluenza identification and strain sub-typing.To be maximally&#13;
useful, the EWARS sentinel sites must be nationally representative. Because at present the mountain&#13;
regions are under-represented, the Project will support expansion o f the network to include eight&#13;
additional sites inthis area, for a total o f 36 sites. EachEWARS site should collect a minimumo f five&#13;
samples per month from patients meeting the case definition for ILI.This would generate a minimumo f&#13;
180 specimens per month, or 2,160 specimens annually. As the laboratory capacity at NPHLmatures, the&#13;
numbero fmonthly specimens maybe increased. The project will support technical assistance to develop&#13;
ILIsurveillance guidelines, includingcase definitions, for the EWARSnetwork, training ofEWARS&#13;
personnel on these guidelines and penodic re-training, provision o frapid diagnostic kits (costed&#13;
separately inthe lab component) to the sites, shipment o f specimens, and data collection and transfer.&#13;
&#13;
Human avian influenza and viralpneumonia surveillance through the WEO/ImmunizationPreventable&#13;
Diseases (IPD) system&#13;
&#13;
The WHO/IPD system has built an extensive network o f sites that conduct active and passive surveillance&#13;
for a number o f vaccine-preventable conditions, reporting this information on a weekly basis&#13;
(immediately when a case of AFP i s identified). This network also has an infrastructure for specimen&#13;
collection and shipment. As such, it i s probably the system which produces the highest quality data inthe&#13;
country. Within six months o f project initiation, this system will incorporate surveillance for cases o f&#13;
severe Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI)and likely viral pneumonia as a means to identify possible&#13;
human cases o f avian influenza. Information will be collected from all identified cases to determine if&#13;
they have risk factors for avian influenza disease (contact with someone with the disease, travel to an area&#13;
withknown avianinfluenza, or contact with sick and dyingpoultry).For any person meeting the&#13;
establishedcase definition, specimens will be immediately collected, tested using rapid diagnostic hts,&#13;
and shipped to NPHL.The appropriate rapid response team will also be alerted. The project will support&#13;
costs associated with surveillance guideline development, training o f IPDpersonnel with periodic&#13;
refresher training, specimen collection and shipment, and data collection and management. It i s difficult&#13;
to know how many potential cases may be identifiedby this system, but as the system matures and if&#13;
avian influenza occurs inpoultry inNepal, this number would be expected to go up over the course o fthe&#13;
project. For the purposes o f costing, the project estimates that as many as 2,000 cases will be investigated&#13;
and that 50 o fthese will meet the case definition for suspected avian influenza inthe first 12months o f&#13;
the surveillance. These numbers could increase by 25 percent per year. Inadditional to its value for avian&#13;
influenza, this system will also provide information on the baseline occurrence o f severe ARI and&#13;
pneumonia inthe country, identify clusters o f such cases for investigation, and should enhance studies o f&#13;
the etiology o f these cases.&#13;
&#13;
Improving surveillance system data collection, transfer, analysis, and dissemination&#13;
&#13;
Itis importantthat information collected throughthe vanous systems beingdeveloped for avian and&#13;
pandemic influenzabe integrated, analyzed, disseminated, and reportedin systematic fashion. It i s also&#13;
important that mechanisms be developed to collect data on the progress o f the epidemic should an&#13;
influenza pandemic develop. Such data will allow the health care system to gauge the extent and seventy&#13;
o f the epidemic inNepal and its temporal course. Such information will allow policy-makers to make&#13;
informed decisions about allocation o fpreventive and health care resourcesto those areas in greatest&#13;
need. The project will support development o f surveillance mechanisms for the pandemic phase and&#13;
distribution and training usingthese guidelines throughout the surveillance system. The project will also&#13;
support enhancement o fthe current surveillance unitsat the regional and national level for data collection&#13;
and transfer to the Surveillance Unito f EDCD, and the development o f a web site and bulletins for&#13;
dissemination o f information regarding avian influenza and other surveillance data.&#13;
&#13;
Influenza rapid diagnostic kitsfor surveillancesites and rapid responseteams&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         31&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Although they do not provide a definitive diagnosis o fthe presence o f human avian influenza, rapid&#13;
diagnostic kitshave an important role to play inthe surveillance and investigationof this disease. These&#13;
luts can provide an important early clue to the presence o f avian influenza in someone with a compatible&#13;
illness, thereby allowing early interventions to be initiated. They also encourage health care providers to&#13;
participate insurveillance efforts and allow them to better care for persons with regular seasonal&#13;
influenza. However, studies have shown that these I t s lack sensitivity, particularly for avian influenza&#13;
sub-types, and are also associated with false positive findings. Therefore specimens must still be tested&#13;
usingmore reliablemethods such as PCR and virus isolation.These kits are also costly. Giventhese&#13;
factors, the project will support distribution o fthese luts to the EWARS sites conductinginfluenza&#13;
surveillance and to the eight regional RRTs.For most RRT investigations, it would be usual to conduct&#13;
more than ten rapid tests per investigation. The project will also support training inthe proper use o frapid&#13;
diagnostic kits and the interpretation o f the results. The project will also support replenishment o f these&#13;
luts over the duration o f the project.&#13;
&#13;
Development of conventional and real timepolymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and ELISA-based&#13;
serologic diagnosis at the National Public Health Laboratory&#13;
&#13;
PCR has been shown to be a reliable method to diagnose avian influenza. Studies have shown that real&#13;
time PCR i s more sensitive and rapid than conventional PCR testing. However, even this assay has&#13;
problems for the diagnosis o f avian influenza inhumans, because at present persons with this disease do&#13;
not have large quantities o fvirus inthe upper respiratory tract. Serology i s an alternative method to&#13;
diagnose influenza, including that caused by avian sub-types. But serology i s o f limited utility in&#13;
diagnosing this disease, as acute and convalescent specimens must be obtained. As a result, it i s useful for&#13;
epidemiologic purposes but i s not timely enough to guide patient care. It is also useful for special&#13;
epidemiologic investigations, such as serosurveys o f culling workers, health care workers, or in&#13;
communities with outbreaks. Given the limited laboratory infrastructure inNepal, the project does not&#13;
support developing PCR and serology capacity throughout the country. Instead, development o f such&#13;
capacities inthe NPHL is supported. NPHL already has the ability to perform conventional PCR. The&#13;
project will support the acquisition o fprimer, reagents and supplies for conventional PCR untilRT-PCR&#13;
can be put inplace. For RT-PCR,the project will support acquisition o f equipment, reagents, and supplies&#13;
for this test at NPHL.The project will also support acquisition o f ELISA luts for influenza serologic&#13;
testing. For the purposes o f costing, the project anticipates that 5,000 PCR assays would be conducted&#13;
annually, and that not more than 500 serologic assays would be performed annually. The project will&#13;
support laboratory infrastructure to support PCR and serology, including training, staffing, equipment,&#13;
and renovation for the laboratory. This capacity will not only be utilized for influenza, but for other&#13;
diseases o fpublic health significance inNepal that can be diagnosed by RT-PCR.&#13;
&#13;
Virus isolation/BSL3 capacity at NPHL&#13;
&#13;
Several viral diseases present inNepal require biosafety level 3 capacity. At present, there i s no&#13;
laboratory inNepal that has the capacity to conduct virus isolation or handling o f specimens at the BSL3&#13;
level, and all samples must be shipped outside o fthe country for diagnosis. This i s costly, involves proper&#13;
shipment o f specimens usinginternational specifications, and most importantly, impedes definitive&#13;
diagnosis. Taking advantage o f this Project, the laboratory capacity inNepal would be upgraded to&#13;
provide BSL3 capacity. This feature i s common to animal health and human health components, and&#13;
therefore close collaborationbetween the two CCTs would be essential. BSL3 work i s costly and requires&#13;
a level o f capacity far above that which currently exists inNepal. The project will support efforts to&#13;
develop virus isolation and BSL3 capacity at NPHL, recognizing that this will take considerable time to&#13;
develop and will require a commitment on the part o f the Ministryo f Health and Populationto sustain&#13;
after the project ends. Inaddition, there i s no expertise inNepal to design or construct a BSL3 facility.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        32&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Therefore, the project will also support an international technical consultant or firm to support NPHLin&#13;
assessing the ability o f current facilities to support a BSL3 lab, help design the facility, and support&#13;
construction efforts. The project will also support reagents and supplies for virus isolation, training o f&#13;
personnel inthe operation o f the facility and invirus isolation, development o fbiosafety protocols,&#13;
supplies for biosafety and waste disposal (including an incinerator), equipment, and maintenance. Any&#13;
renovation efforts should include those necessary for the PCR space, even though it i s recognizedthat&#13;
PCR does not requireBSL3 and should notbe conducted inthe same physical area as virus isolation.It is&#13;
unlikely that virus isolation capacity will exist at NPHLuntilat least the secondyear o fthe project.&#13;
Duringthe interimperiod, the project will support costs for shipment o fspecimens to an international&#13;
partner for the purposes o fvirus isolation and definitive diagnosis. The project will also support NPHL&#13;
participation ina quality assurance program for both PCR and virus isolation.&#13;
&#13;
GONhas agreedto; (i) sufficientbudgetary allocations fkom its ownresources for the adequate&#13;
                          provide&#13;
maintenance, supplies, and other recurrent costs for the satisfactory operation o f the BSL-3 laboratories&#13;
beyond the life o f the project as long as necessary; (ii) ensure the recruitment, appointment, or assignment&#13;
o f adequate number o ftrained personnel to operate the two laboratories at BSL-3 level as long as&#13;
necessary; and (iii) take all necessary actions to obtain and maintain the necessary BSL-3 certification&#13;
from appropriate organizations.&#13;
&#13;
Laboratory Information Management System at NPHL&#13;
&#13;
The laboratory improvements listed above, and the volume o f samples expected to be processedbyNPHL&#13;
require that the laboratory has an information system to manage the data generated as a result. At present&#13;
NPHLhas minimalcomputerization and electronic data management. The projectwill support the&#13;
development and implementationo f such a system, including the necessary hardware, software, and&#13;
networkmg. For the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) to be most useful, it must have&#13;
seamless linkage to the epidemiologic systems developed inEDCD, so that laboratory information can be&#13;
integrated into the databaseson cases. Therefore NPHLmust work closely with EDCD inthe design and&#13;
development o f the system. Since both are located on the same campus, NPHLshould share the data&#13;
managerhnformationspecialist that will be hired to work on avian andpandemic influenza-related issues.&#13;
The LIMS should benefit not only work relatedto avian influenza, but should also benefit information&#13;
management inthe laboratory ingeneral.&#13;
&#13;
Sub-component2.2: Preventionand Containment&#13;
&#13;
Prevention of avian and seasonal influenza in high risk occupationalsettings&#13;
&#13;
There are certain occupational settings where the risko f exposure to avian influenza i s higher than inthe&#13;
general population. These settings include persons engaged inculling actiwties ifavian influenza is&#13;
discovered inpoultry inNepal, persons engaged inpoultry reanng activities, health care workers canng&#13;
for persons with avian influenza, laboratory workers who will be handling specimens containing this virus&#13;
or working with live virus, and those who will be conducting field investigations as part o f the RRTs.&#13;
Measures should be taken to reduce riskamong such persons. These measures include education and&#13;
training, barrier precautions to reduce exposure to the virus, disinfection and hygienic measures to reduce&#13;
surface contamination, and inspecific circumstances, antiwral prophylaxis. At present there i s no human&#13;
vaccine for avian influenza strains that have producedhuman disease, and such vaccines may not be&#13;
available untilwell into an influenza pandemic. With the exception o f antiviral prophylaxis, measures to&#13;
protect workers engaged inculling activities and those working inthe commercial poultry sector are part&#13;
o f the animal health component o f this Project. The project will support measures to protect health care&#13;
workers likely to care for patients with avian influenza (e.g. those workers at referral facilities established&#13;
as part o fthis project), including personal protective equipment, hygienic supplies, and antiviral&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        33&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
prophylaxis. The same applies to workers at NPHLand members o f the eight RRTs that will conduct&#13;
investigations o f suspected or confirmed avian influenza, including specimen collection. For the purposes&#13;
o f costing and estimating needs, this would include 200 persons engaged inhealth care activities at&#13;
referral centers, 1,500 persons engaged inculling activities (district-level animal health core teams), 80&#13;
members o f the regional rapid response teams (two teams of five per site), and 20 persons working in&#13;
NPHL.Becausepatients with avianinfluenzamaybe seenor hospitalizedat facilities at levelsofthe&#13;
health care system below the referral center, it i s also appropriate for these facilities to have access to&#13;
personal protective equipment and antiviral prophylaxis. Therefore the project will support a small cache&#13;
o f PPE and antivirals ineach o f the five regions that can be distributed on an as-needed basis, along with&#13;
a reserve maintained at the central level inKathmandu. The project will support training o f persons in&#13;
highnskoccupational groups onmeasures to reduce exposure nsk,including use o f supplies and&#13;
equipment.&#13;
&#13;
Seasonal influenza vaccine i s not protective against avian influenza. However, it i s important to reduce&#13;
the potential for co-infection with avian and seasonal influenza viruses. Co-infection could result invirus&#13;
reassortment and acquisition by avian subtypes o f genetic segments from human subtypes. Ifthis&#13;
occurred, the virus could more readily be passed from person-to-person, resulting ina pandemic sub-type.&#13;
To mitigate this possibility, it is recommended that highrisk groups be vaccinated against seasonal&#13;
influenza with trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV). Therefore, the Project will support use o f TIV inhigh&#13;
riskoccupational groups, includinghealthcare workers inreferral facilities, laboratoryworkers, andRRT&#13;
members. Ifa group o f individuals who will definitely be engaged inculling activities can be identified,&#13;
the Project will also support vaccinatingthis group.&#13;
&#13;
Prevention of transmission in high risk contacts ofpersons diagnosed with avian influenza&#13;
&#13;
Duringthe pre-pandemic phase, ringantiviralprophylaxis (also knownas contactprophylaxis) o fclose&#13;
contacts (usually household members) o fpersons diagnosed with avian influenza i s considered an&#13;
important measure to limit disease spread. Community prophylaxis is also considered important in&#13;
circumstances where chains o f person-to-person transmission are evident (when WHO pandemic phase 4&#13;
i s recognized) to reduce the risk o f spread beyond the affected community. However, inthis situation,&#13;
WHO has indicatedthat its stockpile o f antiviral drugswill be deployed to cover such use. Therefore, the&#13;
Project will support acquisition o f a limited stockpile o f antivlral drugs to cover contact prophylaxis&#13;
duringpandemic stage 3 (the current phase). This stockpile canbe maintainedinthe five regional centers&#13;
and at the central level, since they will most likely be distributed by the rapid response teams as part o f&#13;
the case or outbreak investigation. Replenishment o f this stockpile will also be supported. For the&#13;
purposes o f cosbng, a 25 percent annual replacement will be supported. Ifthe drugs are not used, the&#13;
additional matenal can be used to build the stockpile for use dunngthe pandemic phase. The antiviral&#13;
medication stockpile will also be used for treatment o fpersons with suspected or confirmed disease due to&#13;
avian influenza.&#13;
&#13;
Planningfor acquisition and use ofpandemic influenza vaccine&#13;
&#13;
At present, there are no human vaccines for avian influenza sub-types that are knownto haveproduced&#13;
human disease. Efforts are underway in several countries to develop and produce such vaccines.&#13;
However, untila pandemic strain actually develops, it i s unknown how effective any o f these vaccines&#13;
will be against the specific pandemic strain. However, if apandemic vaccine was available, its likely&#13;
protective efficacy would be high.Most current planning efforts assume a pandemic vaccine will not be&#13;
available duringthe early phases o f a pandemic. However, these planningefforts also assume that not all&#13;
areas will be immediately impacted by a pandemic, and that there are likely to be multiple waves to a&#13;
pandemic as there have been inprevious pandemics. Therefore, there a pandemic vaccine that i s not&#13;
available dunngthe initial wave may still be beneficial. Because o f these many unknowns, including&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       34&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
when a pandemic may occur, the Project cannot support large scale acquisibon o fvaccines against avian&#13;
influenza duringthe pre-pandemic phase. However, the Project does support efforts to develop plans for&#13;
vaccine acquisition and distribution, including defining pnority groups for use o f vaccine (groups&#13;
supporting critical infrastructure, persons at risk o f severe disease, etc.).&#13;
&#13;
Development of a quarantine networkfor Nepal&#13;
&#13;
At present, Nepal does not have an organized quarantine systemto prevent importation o fhumandisease&#13;
from outside the country, either by air or land ports o fentry. For many emerging infectious diseases,&#13;
including avian influenza, this i s an important gap. Inaddition, the revised International Health&#13;
Regulations (IHRs), passedby the World Health Assembly in2005, mandate that quarantine facilities&#13;
exist at major ports o f entry by 2007, including the ability to identify and care for persons who may be&#13;
carrying communicable diseases covered under the regulations. Inthe event o f avian influenza exhibiting&#13;
limited person-to-person transmissibility, whether within or external to Nepal, authorities may be called&#13;
upon to screen exiting or entenngtravelers, or at the very least to distribute information to travelers.&#13;
Therefore the project will support activities to develop a modem quarantine system for the country.&#13;
&#13;
The Ministryo f Health has identified eight locations that represent major air and land ports o f entry. One&#13;
is at Tribhuvan International Airport. The others are at seven major internationalland crossings inNepal,&#13;
one with China and six with India. The Project will support incrementaldevelopment o f quarantine&#13;
facilities at each o f these locations, so that all are complete by the thirdyear. At each o f these locations,&#13;
the Project will support identification o f a facility that can serve as a quarantine office and can be used to&#13;
examine travelers, equipment for these facilities, and staffing and other operational costs. The Project wil&#13;
also support development o f guidelines andprocedures for the quarantine system, along with training o f&#13;
personnel. Technical assistance will be supported to develop guidelines and procedures. As per the IHRs:&#13;
each facility must identify a mechanismfor care o fpersons with suspected disease requiring quarantine,&#13;
but suchhealthcare facilities maybe off-site. Many locations contract for such servicesrather than&#13;
provlde them directly.&#13;
&#13;
Legal and regulatory review&#13;
&#13;
Successful containment andprevention o f avian and pandemic influenza may require the use o ftools not&#13;
often employedby public health authonties, such as quarantine measures, other social distancing&#13;
measures, use o f expenmental vaccines and therapeutics, and use o f unlicensed health care practitioners.&#13;
There needs to be a sound legal basis for such measures. The foundation o f such measures for Nepal i s the&#13;
Communicable Disease Control Act o f 1964. While this law exists, the regulatory framework for its&#13;
implementationwas never written. Inaddition, it i s now more than 40 years old and likely needs to be&#13;
updated to reflect the current public health situation. The Project will support a review o f current laws and&#13;
regulations that mightbe applicable to avian and pandemic influenza surveillance, prevention, and control&#13;
measures. The purpose o f the review i s to identify problems and gaps, and propose measures to address&#13;
them. At a minimum,the review should include the basis for current surveillance activities, quarantine&#13;
and isolation, use o f unlicensed products, conduct o f other types o f research, use o f a volunteer&#13;
workforce, and liability issues. The Project will support a technical consultant to conduct this review and&#13;
propose remedies.&#13;
&#13;
Planningfor non-pharmacologic interventions (including social distancing) to contain human avian and&#13;
pandemic influenza&#13;
&#13;
A variety o fnon-pharmacological interventions are available for the preventionand containment o favian&#13;
and pandemic influenza. Limited studies and some modeling studies suggest that some o f these&#13;
interventions may substantially impact the occurrence o f disease. These measures include social&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         35&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
distancing (community quarantine, school closures, suspension o f activities such as social and sporting&#13;
events, business closures, etc.), use o f masks and other bamer precautions outside o f health care facilities,&#13;
and community hygienic and disinfectionmeasures. An assessment o f these measures i s required for their&#13;
appropriateness inNepal and their relative pnority based on scientific information. After this i s done,&#13;
plans should then be developed for their application and use during the various pandemic phases. The&#13;
project will support such an assessment, including technical consultation, and will support development&#13;
o fplans for their implementation inNepal. Since these measures require considerable cooperation from&#13;
other parts o f the government, from NGOs, from the private sector and from the business and religious&#13;
community, the assessment and planningprocess should include participation o f these groups.&#13;
&#13;
Sub-component 2.3: Health care delivery systempreparednessand response&#13;
&#13;
The health care system mustbe prepared to care for persons with suspected or confirmed avian influenza&#13;
duringany o fthe three major WHO phases (the pre-pandemic phase, the pandemic alert phase, and the&#13;
pandemic phase). The needs, requirements, and constraints o f the health care system inNepal differ&#13;
within these phases. Duringthe pre-pandemic and pandemic alertphase, few cases o f disease will be&#13;
identified. These can be handledat designated health care facilities that have trainedpersonnel and are&#13;
outfitted for patient isolation. Ifthe pandemic phase i s reached, the health care system will be stretched&#13;
and the priority i s to care for large numbers o f illindividuals efficiently and ina manor appropnate for the&#13;
health care context o fNepal. Itwill be especially important to support the lowest levels o f the health care&#13;
system, since there are insufficient medical facilities, especially inpatient facilities (the country has only&#13;
16,000 hospital beds) to meet all o fthe potentialneeds. Inmany instances, the diagnosis o f avian&#13;
influenzamay not be made immediately, even with anticipated enhancements to the surveillance and&#13;
laboratory infrastructure. Some o fthese cases may not be able to be confirmed. Therefore any efforts to&#13;
support and upgrade the health care delivery system shouldbenefit more general public healthneeds. In&#13;
the case o f the health care system, this includes acute respiratory illness and other diseases that might&#13;
benefit from patient isolation. The Project will support efforts to develop an acute respiratorydisease&#13;
tnage andreferral system, and to provide planning tools and resourcesto the pnmary health care system&#13;
for the pandemic phase.&#13;
&#13;
Development of an acute respiratory disease ( A D ) triage and referral system&#13;
&#13;
To develop and implement ARD triage and referral, a number o f activities must be undertaken. These&#13;
include development o f standardized guidelines for evaluation, diagnosis, care, and referral o fpatients&#13;
withrespiratory disease that mightbe due to avlan influenza; training o fhealth care personnel at all levels&#13;
o f the health care system; designation o f referral facilities at the regional and national level and upgrading&#13;
of these facilities to care for persons with avian influenza within the context o f the Nepalihealth care&#13;
system; development o fplans for acquisition o f supplies and medications neededto care for large&#13;
numbers o f patients duringthe pandemic phase; and limited acquisition o f these supplies and medications.&#13;
These activities will also improve care o fpatients with non-influenza respiratory disease, a major cause o f&#13;
morbidity and mortality inNepal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
0    Guidelines: For guideline development and dissemination, the Project will support technical&#13;
     assistance. Such guidelines exist elsewhere, but their relevance to the Nepali health care system must&#13;
     be assessedand they mustbe adapted appropnately. It i s important that these guidelines be developed&#13;
     inthe early phases o fthe Project, since training efforts for healthcare providerswill be extensive, and&#13;
     cannot commence without the guidelines that form the basis o fthe training. Guidelinesmust also be&#13;
     developed for each level o fthe health care system, since the level o f care, including diagnostic&#13;
     capacity and slulls, increases from the local to district to regional to national level. Once developed,&#13;
     these guidelines must be periodically re-examined and updated as the scientific knowledge regarding&#13;
     the clinical aspects o f avian influenza increases.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        36&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      Training:When the guidelines are available, training should commence usinga tiered `train the&#13;
     trainer' approach. Standardized training materials will be developed, approved by the Ministryo f&#13;
     Health; and then disseminated throughout the system. Training at all levels should be accomplished&#13;
     duringthe first year, and then repeatedannually inabbreviated fashion. The project will support&#13;
     outside assistance to accomplish training goals. Bothguideline development and training materials&#13;
     may benefit from a collaborative relationshipwith a Nepali academic partner.&#13;
&#13;
     Facilities upgrades: To support acute respiratory disease triage activities, referral facilities mustbe&#13;
     designated and upgraded. The Project will support designation o f one facility ineachregion to serve&#13;
     as a referral center with an isolation ward o f at least ten beds. The isolation ward i s most useful&#13;
     duringthe pre-pandemic andpandemic alert phase, when there are small numbers o fpatients with&#13;
      avian influenza, but can also help support severely illpatients dmng the pandemic phase. When there&#13;
     are no patients with avian influenza hospitalizedinthese isolationwards, they should be usedfor&#13;
     other patients with severe acute respiratory disease or for patients with non-respiratory diseases where&#13;
      isolation i s indicated. The project will support facility renovations, staffing support with infection&#13;
     control measures (as outlined inthe prevention and containment section), basic equipment (e.g.&#13;
     oxygen generators, suction devices, pulse oximeters), and appropnate waste disposal. The Project will&#13;
      also support designation o f one facility as a national reference hospital (NRH) inKathmandu. The&#13;
     designated facility should have appropriate staffing and infrastructure (laboratory, radiology,&#13;
     pharmacy, waste disposal) to care for severely illpatients. This facility must also designate a location&#13;
     which can support a ten-bed isolation ward. As with the regional facilities, the Project will support&#13;
     renovations, staff support, infection control, basic equipment, and waste disposal. Technical support&#13;
     can be requested for facilities renovations. The facility chosen by the GoN for this purpose i s&#13;
      Shukraraj Tropical InfectiousDiseases Hospital (STIDH); however this hospital does not yet have the&#13;
     minimumrequiredinfrastructure to be aNRH,andthe GoNhas agreed to upgrade it to provide such&#13;
     infrastructure, withinthe next two years usingits own resources. It has been decided that the&#13;
     Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH)will serve as an interim NRHuntil STIDH is ready&#13;
     to take this function on.&#13;
&#13;
     Planning and limited acquisition of medications and supplies: Dunngthe pandemic stage, there will&#13;
     be a need for additional supplies and medications to treat large numbers o f illpersons, including the&#13;
     secondary complications o f influenza. Among the additional medications are antimicrobial agents to&#13;
     cover the organisms which produce secondary pneumonias, antipyretic drugs, and cough&#13;
     suppressants. However, because the timingo f an influenza pandemic i s unpredictable, it i sunwise to&#13;
     procure large quantities o fthese medications which may then notbe used. The project will support&#13;
     limited acquisition o f these medications to support the isolationwards o f the referral centers listed&#13;
     above, and will support a planningprocess to assure access to these medications when needed during&#13;
     a pandemic phase (such as assmng a stockpile bubble among the suppliers and distributors which can&#13;
     be accessed by the government as needed).&#13;
&#13;
Plans and capacitiesfor theprimary care system (ilaka and below) to meet health care needs during an&#13;
influenza pandemic&#13;
&#13;
Duringan influenzapandemic, healthcare services will be severely stretchedto meet the needs o flarge&#13;
numbers o f illindividuals. Given the limited capacity o f in-patient health care facilities, the burden o f this&#13;
care will fall disproportionately to the primary health care system at the ilaka level and below. Therefore&#13;
it is important to develop contingency plans for how care will be deliveredbythis level o fthe healthcare&#13;
system. The project will support a planningprocess for each ilaka headedby the primary health care&#13;
center that will address what will be done and how it will be done. These plans should address surge&#13;
capacity, including use o f volunteers, and home health care provision. The plans should also consider that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         37&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
a proportion o fthe illindividuals will be the health care workers themselves. Therefore it i s especially&#13;
important for the plans to focus on a back-up work force. It i s possible that inNepal not all regions will be&#13;
affected by the pandemic at the same time. It may therefore be possible to shift health workers and other&#13;
resources to and from areas o f greater and lesser needs. Each PHCwill be expected to plan the response&#13;
applying national assumptions o f impact o f an influenza pandemic to the local level. Since the issues and&#13;
needs are likely to be the same among most o f the ilakas, consideration should be given to developing&#13;
model guidelines and having each ilaka adapt these to local circumstances and capacities. This planning&#13;
activity should not only be relevant to an influenza pandemic, but should strengthen overall preparedness&#13;
for any public health emergency.&#13;
&#13;
Sub-component 3: Communications&#13;
&#13;
The communications subcomponent aims to reduce the negative social impact and threat to human health&#13;
posed by the occurrence o fpoultry outbreaks o f avian influenza, and in doing so minimize the social&#13;
disruption and impact o f an influenza epidemic. This will be done through advocacy, behavioural change&#13;
communication, and social mobilization. A Communications Plan, drafted by UNICEFand WHO, and&#13;
forms the basis for this component, which will be implementedjointly through DoLS and DoHS.&#13;
&#13;
OverallGoal&#13;
&#13;
The overall goal o f the Communication Plan is to prevent and reduce the negative social impact and threat&#13;
to human health from the occurrence o f poultry outbreaks o f avian influenza (AI)and minimize the social&#13;
disruption and impact o f an influenza epidemic through advocacy, behaviour change communication, and&#13;
social mobilization. The specific purpose o fthe plan is to provide a framework and the roadmap to the&#13;
implementation o f the communications component o fthe NAIIPPRP.&#13;
&#13;
Specific Objectives&#13;
&#13;
To achieve the goal o fthe Communication Plan, three main objectives have been identified. Objective&#13;
number 1corresponds to the WHO pandemic phases 1to 3, which i s applicable to Nepal at present. The&#13;
specific activities to meet this objective are already known and will require immediate implementation.&#13;
However, the dissemination o fthe behavioural change communication messages related to this objective&#13;
will not happenautomatically butrather accompany the information requirements set by the epidemic&#13;
developments. Objective number two corresponds to the WHO pandemic phases 4 to 6, which may be&#13;
less likely to affect Nepal inthe very near future. Nonetheless, the current proposal outlines a series o f&#13;
capacity buildingand preparedness activities to ensure government officials, health workers and other key&#13;
stakeholders are fully prepared for an effective communication response should a human outbreak strike&#13;
Nepal or neighbounng countnes. Objective number three i s applicable and relevant to all the WHO&#13;
pandemic phases. Activities to meet this objective will be implementedthroughout the life o f the project&#13;
inNepal though special attention will be givento it immediately inorder to set the foundations for a&#13;
suitable avian influenza communication environment.&#13;
&#13;
Objectivenumber 1will influencebehaviours and attitudes oftargeted and general audiences that lead&#13;
to action to reduce the risk o f avian influenza outbreaks inpoultry and human avian influenza infections.&#13;
The sub-objectives are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
    Gain commitment from key political, social and industnal players to improve quality control o f&#13;
    poultry farming and market chains and reduce the risk o f importation o fthe virus.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
0   Buildthe avian influenzacommunication capacity o fkey groups at the community level including,&#13;
    inter alia, teachers, female community health volunteers, village agriculture extension workers,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       38&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    NGO/CBOsandUNsocial mobilizers that will support the mass media communication component&#13;
    with strategic and targeted interpersonal communicationactivities.&#13;
&#13;

shall be done. DDAwill also develop guidelines for quality control o f the different pharmaceuticals and&#13;
others, including storage and distribution requirements.&#13;
&#13;
Regional Directorates: Regional, Sub-regional and Zonal Hospitals&#13;
&#13;
Public HealthResponse: Support the surveillance network at the district level; strengthen the capacity o f&#13;
the regional and zonal hospitals according to the standards andguidelines set for eachhospitalbythe&#13;
management divlsion. At the pandemic phase, regional stockpiling o f cntical supplies will be ensured.&#13;
The regional Directorates will be responsible for appropriate storage and distribution incollaboration with&#13;
regional medical stores.&#13;
&#13;
Hospital Preparedness: Oversee the implementation o fthe different processes at the hospital level such as&#13;
training, infection control practices, and other public health measures. They will implement mock drills&#13;
exercises for an influenzapandemic situation, both at regional zonal and district hospitals.&#13;
&#13;
District Public Health Ofices: District Hospitals and PHC&#13;
&#13;
Public HealthResponse: Rapid Response Teams will be responsible for field investigation o f ILI&#13;
cases/rumors reported by SHP, HP, PHC and Hospitals. Any outbreak o f ILIshould be investigated with&#13;
the appropnate laboratory support and influenza will be confirmed or discarded with rapid diagnostic tests&#13;
at the district level. A second sample will be kept and inpositive influenza cases it will be sent to NPHL&#13;
for confirmation and further charactmzation. Field investigationwill include association o f cases with&#13;
poultry disease suspected or confirmed. Rapid response teams will follow guidelines for personal&#13;
protection. They will coordinate with the District Livestock Office for continuous interchange o f&#13;
information on suspected avian influenza cases. Once avian influenza i s reportedinNepal, daily reports&#13;
should be submitted to EDCD, including zero reporting.&#13;
&#13;
HealthNetwork Preparedness: The DPHOwill oversee that the PHC, HP, SHP and FCHV are trained on&#13;
the influenza case detection and management guidelines, infection control practices, and other public&#13;
health measures. They will implement mock drills exercises for an influenza pandemic situation.&#13;

influenza. Local Bodies are responsible for disaster management at local level. Currently M o L D has&#13;
designated disaster focal points inDDCs and Municipalities. Given that institutional capacity i s very&#13;
weak at local level, it i s urgently needed to strengthen the capacity o f the focal points. The proposed&#13;
project may therefore: (i)   strengthen the efficiency and enhance the capacity o f local bodies to address the&#13;
problem o fnatural and man-made disaster at the local level; (ii)   conduct public awareness activities&#13;
through social mobilization at grass root level; and (iii) support for making disaster management plan at&#13;
district level.&#13;
&#13;
Inthisregardthe following activities areproposed. Activities to be conductedat centrallevelinclude: (i)&#13;
designing of training course regarding concerned training activities; (ii) (training for trainers) for&#13;

Country FinancialManagement Environment&#13;
&#13;
The Nepal Country FinancialAccountability Assessment (CFAA), jointly conducted by G o N and IDA,&#13;
was completed in2002. The assessment concluded that the failure to comply with the impressive legal&#13;
and regulatory fiduciary framework makes the fiduciary risk inNepal "High", but the risk i s similar to&#13;
that inmost developingcountries. An update o f the CFAA was jointly carried out by GoN, DFIDand&#13;
IDA inMay 2005 to assess: (i)   progress achieved by GONinimplementing the Development Action Plan&#13;
(DAP)o fthe 2002 CFAA; and (ii) institutionalenvironment andrisk for financial accountabilityin&#13;
                                    the&#13;
the current political development context. The assessmentrevealed that the fiduciary risk continues to be&#13;
"High" at the country level, and a revisedDAPhas been agreedto continue to improve financial&#13;
management.&#13;
&#13;
GoNhas computerized an Integrated Financial Management Information System which connects 64 (of&#13;
which 57 are currently functional) out o f 75 districts and includes receiving o f on-line expenditure&#13;
reports. Since 2002, the development budget has beenpnoritized as part of a three-year Medium-Term&#13;
Expenditure Framework (MTEF), and the number o fprojects/programs was significantly reduced.&#13;
Priority projects are requiredto prepare trimester work plans with detailed output/physical achievement&#13;
targets and expected results. For these projects, expenditure reporting and fundrelease procedures are&#13;
now linked to performance and the system will be extended to all other projects/activities. Information on&#13;
budget allocations, expenditures and outputs are now published, and made available to the public. A web&#13;
portal for GONhas been created, with links to public sector departments which contain information on&#13;
programs and activities.&#13;
&#13;
The Accounting Standards Board and Auditing Standards Board were created inMarch 2003 and since&#13;
then these Boards have respectively released 13 Accounting Standards and 30 Auditing Standards.&#13;
Starting from FY2004/05, GON classified its budget into Capital and Recurrent categories, and further&#13;
plans to gradually move towards the IMF's Government Financial Statistics.&#13;
&#13;
Significantreforms were undertaken inpublic audit under the Public Audit ReformProject supported by&#13;
an IDA Institutional Development FundGrant. The Office o f the Auditor General (OAG) has revised&#13;
General Audit Guidelines inline with the International Organization o f Supreme Audit Institutions&#13;
(INTOSAI) standards, and i s gradually changing its focus on audit based on outputs. Increasingly,&#13;
emphasis has beenplaced on performance auditing. OAGnow has its own HumanResource&#13;
DevelopmentPlan, and has been training its staff based on a new set o f guidelines. The recent political&#13;
transition inApril has made possible to reinstate the Parliament, and the Public Accounts Committee has&#13;
been reconstituted and has begun to play the active role that they played approximately four years ago.&#13;
&#13;
Adequacy of Financial Management Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
Department ofLivestock Services. DoLS i s implementing a Bank-financed project for the first time. It i s&#13;
under the Ministry o f Agriculture and Cooperatives (MoAC) and functions under the overall supervision&#13;
and control o f the Director General. Under DoLS, there are four Technical Directorates and five Regional&#13;
Directorates. DoLS has one ChiefFinancial Controller under whom there are two Accounts Officers and&#13;
approximately eight Accountants / Sub-Accountants. DoLS does not have experience inprocurement&#13;
management; however, has assigned one o f the technical staffto function as the Procurement Specialist.&#13;
DoLS follows the government's financial management system, that includes planning budgeting,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      49&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
accounting, internal controls, internal audit, reporting and external audit. Due to simplification inthe&#13;
Bank's disbursement procedure that includes agreement on country financing parameters, accounting&#13;
ledgers will be maintainedas per the country system. For specific purpose o f monitoring the expenses&#13;
against components and activities, the Department will maintain the Program Ledgers as requiredby the&#13;
system. Although this i s a requirement under the system, these ledgers are mostly not complied with, and&#13;
hence this i s an area which will require close monitonng to ensure compliance. Another challenge that&#13;
DoLS has i s the needto coordinate the program and activities of other two line ministnes that may be&#13;
involved inthe program-the Ministryo f Local Development (MOLD)and the Ministry o f Home Affairs&#13;
(MOHA).Further, inconsideration o fthe GON's proposal to place the Secretariat ofthe CDNRC's&#13;
Technical Sub-committee on Avian Influenza inthe Animal Health Directorateunder the Ministryo f&#13;
Agriculture and Cooperatives (MoAC), its related costs for managingthe sub-committee coordination&#13;
will be budgeted under the Animal Health component. DoLS will also needto coordinate withthe&#13;
Technical Sub-committee.&#13;
&#13;
Besides implementing the activities under the animal health component, DoLS has a challenge to be&#13;
accountable to ensure the coordinationandreporting o f activities to be implementedby other two line&#13;
ministnes and the Technical Sub-committee. To address these needs, DoLS has agreed to designate one&#13;
fulltime Accounts Officer and one Accountant to manage and administer the sub-component project&#13;
accounts under the overall oversight o f the Chief Financial Controller. For the purpose o f procurement&#13;
management, DoLS has agreed to deploy one o f full time Procurement Officer either by designating one&#13;
o f its technical staffs or outsourcing the function to a national consultant. To manage the animal health&#13;
component, DoLS will form a core implementationteam with full time staff representing at least five&#13;
members    - the Project Coordinator, Deputy Coordinator (also responsible for overall component&#13;
monitoring), one AccountsEinance Officer, One Procurement Officer and one Communications&#13;
Specialist. DoLS will provide suitable training to its core staff who would be involved inproject&#13;
management, and this includes financial management and procurement staff. For the management o f&#13;
Compensation Fund, DoLS will prepare guidelines which lay out the process and operational modality for&#13;
accessing the compensation fund. The Bank will review these guidelines and finalization o f these&#13;
guidelines satisfactory to IDA will be the disbursement condition for disbursements against compensation&#13;
fund.&#13;
&#13;
Department of Health Services. The DoHS has experience o f implementing a number o f&#13;
projects/programs supported by various development partners, and gained adequate institutional capacity&#13;
as a result. Currently, the DoHS i s implementing a health sector sector-wide program (SWAp) financed&#13;
jointly by IDA and DFIDunder pooled funding. Overall, DoHS i s performing well insector-wide&#13;
operations. There are some inherent issues inthe area o f timely reporting inHealth SWAp, and this i s&#13;
primarily due to staffing issues at the Ministry o fHealth and Population (MoHP), which coordinates the&#13;
program. DoHS i s under the Ministryo fHealth andPopulation (MoHP) and functions under the overall&#13;
supervision and control o f the Director General. Under DoHS, there are five Regional Health&#13;
Directorates. DoHS have one Chief Financial Controller under whom there are four Accounts Officers,&#13;
four Accountants, four Sub-Accountants, and two computer operators. DoHS have a few trained&#13;
procurement staff that have undergone intensive procurement training program inthe Nepal&#13;
Administrative Staff College (NASC). DoHS have agreed to designate one Accounts Officer and one&#13;
Accountant to manage and administer the sub-component project accounts under the overall oversight o f&#13;
the ChiefFinancial Controller. For the purpose o fprocurement management, DoHS has agreed to deploy&#13;
one trainedtechnical staff. For implementing the sub-component activities and to ensure that component&#13;
activities are closely monitored, DoHS will form a core implementation team with full time staff&#13;
representing at least five members    - theProject Coordinator, Deputy Coordinator (also responsible for&#13;
overall component monitonng), one AccountsRinance Officer, one Procurement Officer and one&#13;
Communications Specialist. DoHS will provide suitable training to its core staff who would be involved&#13;
inprojectmanagement, andthis include financialmanagement andprocurement staff. DoHS follow the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       50&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
government's financial management system -this includes planning budgeting, accounting, internal&#13;
controls, internal audit, reporting and external audit. Due to simplification inthe Bank's disbursement&#13;
procedure that includes agreement on country financing parameters, accounting ledgers will be&#13;
maintainedas per the country system. For specific purpose o f monitoring the expenses against&#13;
components and activities, the Department will maintain the Program Ledgers as required by the system.&#13;
Although this i s a requirement under the system, these ledgers are mostly not complied with, and hence&#13;
this is an area whichwillrequire close monitonng to ensure compliance. Overall, the systems and&#13;
procedures satisfy the Bank's minimumfinancial management requirements; the FMarrangements for the&#13;
sub-component will be adequate for project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
RiskAnalysis&#13;
&#13;
From the financial management perspective, the overall risk i s "Substantial" as there are a few critical&#13;
actions such as, staffing, preparation o f Operational Guidelines for use o f Compensation Fund,&#13;
computenzationo fproject and financial information, and training o f staff, that needs to be implemented.&#13;
Subject to satisfactory implementationo f these actions and review thereafter, the fiduciary riskwill be&#13;
reassessed dunngimplementation. Of the two implementing agencies, DoHS comparatively i s better&#13;
positionedwith skilled staff and experience inimplementing donor-financed programs. DoLS, on the&#13;
other hand, would require substantial efforts informing a strong team for project management which&#13;
should include trained financial management and procurement staff. Overall, there will be strong efforts&#13;
incapacitybuildingbothintechnical areas as well as overallprojectmanagementwhich include&#13;
procurement and financial management. Since the Project heavily constitutes o fprocurement tasks, it i s&#13;
important to ensure that boththe Departments have sufficient capacity to carry out envisaged procurement&#13;
o f works, goods and services. T o address certain gaps that have been identified dunng the assessment,&#13;
nskmitigationActionPlanshavebeenagreed. The existence ofthe government's National Strategic Plan&#13;
for Addressing Avian Influenza which was preparedjointly by M o A C and MoHP, with strong support&#13;
from development partners such as WHO and FAO, the formation o f an Avian Influenza Technical Sub-&#13;
committeejointly chaired by two Secretaries o f M o A C and MoHP, and the highpriority o f the&#13;
government to implement this program are some factors that will also mitigate the risks. Because this i s a&#13;
new interventioninNepal, strong emphasis has beenplaceduponcapacity buildingthat includes:&#13;
exposure visits, cross country expenence sharing, capacity buildingboth intechnical and overall project&#13;
management, and close supervision o f the operations by the Bank. These measures will reduce the&#13;
possible nsks. Adequate internal control, monitonng, and safeguard measures have been included.&#13;
&#13;
Strengths&#13;
&#13;
The proposed operation will have the following strengths inthe area o f financial management: (i)   high-&#13;
level government commitment to prevent the outbreak o f avian influenza, (ii) support and&#13;
                                                                                 strong&#13;
collaboration from various development partners such as WHO and FA0 which have the technical&#13;
expertise to assist their respective line departments, and IDA which has a comparative advantage in&#13;
working with the Ministry o f Finance and the National Planning Commission; (iii) government's&#13;
                                                                                     the&#13;
National Strategic Plan for Addressing Avian Influenza; (iv) the formation o f an Avian Influenza&#13;
Technical Sub-committee to oversee and monitor implementation of the Plan; (v) sufficient funds&#13;
allocated towards capacity buildinginDoLS and DoHS; and (vi) relevant staff to be exposed to&#13;
management o f avian influenza programs inother countries to learn from best practices.&#13;
&#13;
WeaknessesandResolutions&#13;
&#13;
Both the Departments are requiredto put inplace a strong core project support team with competent and&#13;
qualified individuals, and to be supplemented by specialists/consultants to be outsourced for specific&#13;
assignments inprocurement, financial management and monitoring, as may be required. Capacity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      51&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
buildingandtraining is apnority for overall programimplementation. Boththe Departments will also&#13;
equip their offices with modem technology and facilitate the use o f computers for information analysis&#13;
and dissemination to monitor bothtechnical and financial progress. For the purpose o f disbursements&#13;
under Compensation Fund,the Operational Guidelines (clearly describing criteria for disbursement and&#13;
internal controls to ensure that funds are disbursed for the intended purpose) duly reviewed and approved&#13;
by IDAandthe Technical Sub-committee, will bethe conditiono f disbursement under this category.&#13;
These funds are accessedonly at the time o f epidemic outbreak - so the process must be inplace before&#13;
any disaster occurs. Overall, internal audit system i s weak and special review arrangements will have to&#13;
be put inplace.&#13;
&#13;
ProjectBudgeting&#13;
&#13;
Itis the responsibilityofboththe Departments to prepare their Annual Work Program andBudget&#13;
(AWPB)for respective components, andwill submit them to MOF andNPC through their respective line&#13;
ministnes. Following the approval o frespective AWPBs, budget authorization will be provided to&#13;
respective Departments with a copy to the relevant Distnct Treasury and Comptroller's Offices (DTCOs)&#13;
by the respective line ministries. DTCOswill release budget to respective Departments. Subsequently,&#13;
respective Departments will issue spending authorization to respective cost centers. Incase o f activities to&#13;
be implementedby other line ministries (this usually happens only at the time o f epidemic outbreak) such&#13;
as, Ministry o f Home Affairs and Ministryo f Local Development, DoLS will include their activities and&#13;
budget within DoLS work programand budget, and will ensure to authorize payments on their behalf.&#13;
Some contingency arrangements will be made by DoLS to disburse funds to these two line ministries in&#13;
case o f outbreaks. Further, DoLS will also include inits budget request from Technical Sub-committee&#13;
for overall coordination activities. GONhas already assigned a separate budget code inthe Government's&#13;
Budget (Red Book) for both DoLS and DoHS to enable reporting o f expenditures and accounts under&#13;
respective components. The Project will fully align with the government's financial management system.&#13;
Programmingand budgeting will follow GON's budgeting system. Both the Departments will operate&#13;
withinthe financial management framework o fthe public sector. DoLS will be requiredto finalize the&#13;
Operational Guidelines to disburse funds against the compensation fund, which i s a Disbursement&#13;
Condition.&#13;
&#13;
FundFlow Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
GONreleases the budgetto the respective Departments as per the approved work program andbudget in&#13;
three tranches as per the fund release procedure o f GON. The budget approved by GON for each&#13;
component i s indicated inthe government's budget (Red Book) under two separate budget heads -one&#13;
under the Ministryo f Health and Populationfor Human Health Component, and the other under the&#13;
Ministryo fAgriculture andCooperative for Animal HealthComponent. Use o fIDAresources for&#13;
respective components i s through two Designated Accounts. These Accounts will facilitate quick&#13;
payments inthe f o m o f reimbursements to government's treasury on account o f actual IDA eligible&#13;
expenditures made for incremental operating costs and compensation fund, and for malung payments to&#13;
contractors, suppliers and consultants.&#13;
&#13;
FinancialManagement Staffing&#13;
&#13;
Department of Livestock Services: The DoLS Financial Administration Section i s headedby a Chief&#13;
Accounts Officer supportedby two accounts officers, and eight accountants / sub-accountants. Each o f&#13;
these staff has the responsibility o f maintaining the accounts o f specific budget headings. Inorder to meet&#13;
the minimumFMrequirements, DoLS needto form and confirm inwriting a core implementation team&#13;
with full time staffrepresenting at least five members - the Project Coordinator, Deputy Coordinator (also&#13;
responsible for overall component monitoring), one AccountsRinance Officer, One Procurement Officer&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       52&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and one Communications Specialist. Other support staffs as required also need to be added inthe core&#13;
team.&#13;
&#13;
Department of Health Services: The DoHS Financial Administration Section is headedby a Chief&#13;
Financial Controller supported by four Accounts Officers, four Accountants, four Sub-Accountants, and&#13;
two computer operators. Each o fthese staffhas the responsibility ofmaintaining the accounts o f specific&#13;
budget headings. Inorder to meet the minimumFMrequirements, DoHS needs to form and confirm in&#13;
writing a core implementationteam with full time staffrepresenting at least five members - the Project&#13;
Coordinator, Deputy Coordinator (also responsible for overall component monitonng), one&#13;
Accounts/Finance Officer, One Procurement Officer and one Communications Specialist. Other support&#13;
staffs as requiredalso needto be added inthe core team.&#13;
&#13;
ProjectFinancialAccounting, ReportingandInternalControls&#13;
&#13;
The financial accounting policies and procedures inplace are sufficient to ensure that both the&#13;
components comply with minimumfinancial management requirements. These include the establishment&#13;
o f internal controls and proper accounting procedures described inthe Financial Administration&#13;
Regulations (FAR). DoLS and DoHS are responsible for maintainingtheir respective accounts o f project&#13;
components. Both Departments will forward monthly expenditure statements for respective component&#13;
accounts to the respective line minisines and Disctrict Treasury Control Offices. The accounting systems&#13;
contain the following features: (i) application o f consistent cash accounting principles for documenting,&#13;
recording, and reporting its financial transactions; (ii) a well-defined chart o f accounts that allows&#13;
meaningful summanzation o f financial transactions for financial reportingpurposes; (iii)     maintenance o f&#13;
withdrawal monitonng register, the record o f Statement o f Expenditures (SOEs), and Designated&#13;
Accounts register; (iv) the use o f an asset register; (v) monthly closing and reconciliation o f accounts and&#13;
statements; and (vi) the production o f annual financial statements acceptable to IDA. Since the project&#13;
accounts would be monitored against component and activities, both the Departments would maintain&#13;
Program Ledgers as per applicable government system. Although maintainingProgram Ledgers i s a&#13;
requirement under the system, these ledgers are mostly not complied with. Inorder to ensure that this i s&#13;
complied with, IDA will require to closely monitoring. For the purpose o f disbursements under&#13;
Compensation Fund, the Operational Guidelines (clearly describing criteria for disbursement and internal&#13;
controls to ensure that funds are disbursed for the intended purpose) duly reviewed and approved by IDA&#13;
and the Technical Sub-committee, will be the condition of disbursement under this category.&#13;
&#13;
InternalAudit&#13;
&#13;
DoLS and DoHS follow the government system for internal audits. Respective DTCOs are responsible to&#13;
cany out internal audits o f all accounts o fvanous cost centers under respective Departments. Since the&#13;
government's internal audit system i s not so effective, boththe Departments will also carry out their own&#13;
review process by outsourcing this arrangement starting from the secondyear. Inclose consultation with&#13;
IDA, Departmentswill prepare appropriate TORSfor this purpose.&#13;
&#13;
ProjectReportsfrombothComponents&#13;
&#13;
Each implementing agency-DoLS         and DoHS-will      produce from the outset Project Reports to report on&#13;
implementationprogress, showing the sources and uses o f funds, output monitonngreport, procurement&#13;
management report and narrative progress report in formats to be agreed upon duringnegotiations. To&#13;
match the public sector planning and reporting cycle, these reports will be produced on a trimester basis&#13;
and submitted within 45 days from the end o f the preceding tnmester.&#13;
&#13;
ExternalAudit&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        53&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The following are the audit requirements under two components:&#13;
&#13;
Part A (DoLSfor Animal Health Component): Annual project financial statements, statements o f&#13;
expenditure schedule, and Designated Accounts statements will be audited by OAG, which i s considered&#13;
acceptable by IDA for this purpose, and submitted to IDA within six months after the end o fthe fiscal&#13;
year -January 15. Terms o freference acceptable to IDA have been discussed and agreed with OAG.&#13;
&#13;
Part B (DoHSfor Human Health Component): Annual project financial statements, SOE schedules, and&#13;
DesignatedAccounts statements will be audited by'OAG, which i s considered acceptable by IDA for this&#13;
purpose, and submitted to IDA within six months after the end o f the fiscal year -January 15. Terms o f&#13;
reference acceptable to IDA have been discussed and agreed with OAG.&#13;
&#13;
For both components, arrangement for performance audit will also be put inplace. Such audits will be: (i)&#13;
carned out by OAG inclose consultation with DoLS and DoHS and inthe time frame that will be&#13;
mutually agreed between the auditees and OAG; and (ii)    at the discretiono fthe Auditor General. GON&#13;
will ensure adequate budget to OAGto cany out these performance audits that will examine the&#13;
challenges encountered and tasks accomplished duringthe course o f project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
The following audit reports would be monitored inthe Audit Report Compliance system (ARCS):&#13;
&#13;

SupervisionPlan&#13;
&#13;
Project implementationprogress will be closely monitoredby DoLS, DoHS, the National Avian Influenza&#13;
Technical Sub-committee, and IDA.IDA will supervise project implementation from the Nepal Country&#13;
Office for the purposes o f supervision on fiduciary aspects (both procurement and financial management).&#13;
Boththe Departments will separately report on project implementation progress through a trimester&#13;
Project Report. The agreed action plans will be closely monitored to ensure appropriate actions are being&#13;
implemented. Key financial management (FM) fiduciary work includes: (i)           penodic visits to cost centers&#13;
for ex-post reviews, and ifany ineligible expenditures are noted, (ii)   reviews of implementation progress&#13;
reports and audit reports and preparing summaries o f such reports; and (c) participating insupervision&#13;
missions and keeping the team informed o f financial management issues or improvements.&#13;

FundsFlow andDisbursementArrangements&#13;
&#13;
For both components, disbursements from IDA will initially be made inaccordance with traditional&#13;
disbursement procedures, including full documentation for contracts above the Prior Review threshold.&#13;
To facilitate disbursements, two Designated Accounts will be established, one for DoLS (Animal Health&#13;
Component) and the other for DoHS (Human Health Component), managedby the Department o f&#13;
Livestock Services and the Department o f Health Services, respectively. For large payments, exceeding&#13;
the 20 percent minimumapplicationsize threshold ofthe authorized ceiling, direct payments may be&#13;
claimed from IDA, as needed. For all other payments, including incrementaloperating costs,&#13;
disbursements from IDA will be made via replenishments o f the Designated Account. Duringthe project&#13;
mid-termreview, the desirability and feasibility o f switching to report-based disbursement will be&#13;
assessed.Untilthat time, transaction-based disbursement will be used for both components.&#13;
&#13;
GONprefinances incremental operating costs and compensation funds. The guideline, which i s yet to be&#13;
developed, will have procedures explained to calculate the funds for compensation. Finalization o fthe&#13;
guidelines that should be acceptable to IDA will be the condition for disbursements under compensation&#13;
fund. Such funds will be utilized only incase o favian flu outbreaks to compensate against animals&#13;
destroyed. All prefinanced expenditures after reconciliation will be reimbursed from respective&#13;
Designated Accounts to the GON's Treasury. For other payments to contractors, contractors and&#13;
suppliers, the Departments will pay directly from their Designated Accounts. The followng funds flow&#13;
chart describes the fimds flow arrangements:&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Use of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs)&#13;
&#13;
For both components, SOEs will be used for the following expenditures: (i) expenditures made under&#13;
                                                                               all&#13;
the Compensation Fund; (ii)   all training, workshop, and study tours; (iii) incremental operating costs;&#13;
                                                                            all&#13;
(iv) contracts for civil works, costing less than US$lOO,OOO; (v) contracts for equipment and vehicles,&#13;
costing less than US$200,000 equivalent per contract; (vi) contracts for services o f consulting firms&#13;
costing less than US$lOO,OOO equivalent per contract; and (vii) contracts for services o f individual&#13;
consultants costing less thanUS$50,000 equivalent per contract. Duringthe IDA initial supervision, the&#13;
mission will closely review the SOE claims to ensure that the funds are utilized for the intended purposes.&#13;
Any ineligible expenditure identified dunngsuchreviews will needto be refundedto IDA.&#13;
&#13;
DesignatedAccounts&#13;
&#13;
To facilitate project implementation and reduce the volume o f withdrawal applications, two Designated&#13;
Accounts inU S Dollars will be establishedunder the Grant, on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA&#13;
for each Part o f IDA financing. The authorized ceilings will be US$l,OOO,OOO,    respectively for designated&#13;
Accounts A for DoLS (Part 1) and designated account B for DoHS (Part 2). The respective allocations&#13;
will cover about six months o f eligible expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
For the utilization o f IDA'Sshare o fproject expenditures, DoLS and DoHS may respectively open and&#13;
maintain the Designated Accounts inU S dollars at the Nepal Rastra Bank or a commercial bank under&#13;
terms and conditions acceptable to IDA.For DoLS (Part l), Designated Accounts A will be managed&#13;
                                                              the&#13;
under thejoint signatures o f the Director General and the Chief Finance Controller. Similarly, for DoHS,&#13;
the DesignatedAccount (Part 2) willbe managedunderthejoint signatures o fthe Director General and&#13;
the ChiefFinance Controller.&#13;
&#13;
Both implementing agencies will ensure that the bankkash books are reconciled with bank statements&#13;
every month. They will separately submit replenishment applications for their respective Designated&#13;
Accounts on a monthly basis. Replenishment applications will be accompanied by a reconciliation&#13;
statement and a Statement from the Bank, inwhich the account i s maintained, showing all Designated&#13;
Account transactions. Supporting documentation will be maintainedby the respective cost centers for at&#13;
least one year after the Association has receivedthe audit report for the fiscal year inwhich the last&#13;
withdrawal from the credit account was made. The documentation will be made available for review by&#13;
IDA supermionmissions and independent auditors.&#13;
&#13;
A list ofbeneficianes receivingCompensation Fundwill be submitted on a Statement o fExpenditures for&#13;
IDA'Sreimbursement to the Designated Account.&#13;
&#13;
RetroactiveFinancing&#13;
&#13;
Retroactive financing o f up to US$l.O million will be available from the Project for covering eligible&#13;
expenditures under all Categories incurred before the date o f signing but after July 17, 2006. In order to&#13;
ensure that only eligible expenses are claimed, it i s important to mitigate key nsks at project outset before&#13;
the funds can begin to flow.&#13;

consultant selection methods, the need for pre-qualification, estimated costs, prior review requirements,&#13;
and time frame are agreed between the Recipient and the Bank inthe Procurement Plan. The Procurement&#13;
Plan will be updated at least annually or as required to reflect the actual project implementationneeds and&#13;
improvements ininstitutional capacity.&#13;
&#13;
For the activities that will be financed by the Association, guidelines on the procurement procedures,&#13;
applicable SBDs to be used for eachprocurement method are presented inAnnexure 1o f the Operation&#13;

&#13;
B. Assessment of the agency's capacityto implementprocurement&#13;
&#13;
ImplementationArrangements: There will be two main implementing agencies -(a) the Departmentof&#13;
Livestock Services (DoLS) under the Ministryo f Agnculture and Cooperatives (MoAC) and (b) the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       60&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Department o f Health Services (DoHS) under the Ministryo f Health and Population (MoHP) and hence&#13;
procurement activities will be carned out by the designated Core Coordination Teams (CCT) ineach o f&#13;
these agencies. Each CCT shall be headedby a Coordinator and shall include a procurement officer.&#13;
&#13;
An assessment o fthe capacity o fthe DoLS andDoHS to implement procurement actions under their&#13;
respective project components (i.e. Animal Health for DoLS and Human Health for DoHS) has been&#13;
carried out. This assessmentreviewed the organizational structure for implementing the project and the&#13;
interactionbetween the project's staff responsible for procurement and the Ministry's relevant central unit&#13;
for administration and finance.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
C.ProcurementPlan&#13;
&#13;
The Recipienthas prepared a detailed procurement plan for project implementationbased on the detailed&#13;
list o f goods, equipment and services provided. This plan provides details o f the contract packages, the&#13;
procurement methods and review requirements for eachprocurement package. This plan has been agreed&#13;
between the Recipient and the Bank by project negotiations and shall be made available at the offices o f&#13;
the respective CCTs. It will also be available inthe project's website and inthe Bank's external website.&#13;
The Procurement Plan will be updated inagreement with the Bank annually or as requiredto reflect the&#13;
actual project implementationneeds and improvements ininstitutional capacity.&#13;
&#13;
Role of UNAgenciesinimplementation: Three UNagencies, i.e., FAO, UNICEF, and WHO have been&#13;
closely involved inthe preparation o fthe national program as well as the Bank-financedproject and the&#13;
Recipienthas proposed their continuedinvolvement duringthe implementation o fthis project, in areas&#13;
where they have specific expertise, for the followingreasons:&#13;
&#13;
(a) the need for providing technical and operational continuity;&#13;
(b) the importance ofinternational expenence and expertise that they bnng, especially as Avian Influenza&#13;
     is not an issue that Nepal has dealt with inthe past;&#13;
(c) the value added interms o f synergies with other activities being carried out by these agencies inthe&#13;
     area of avian influenzaprevention and control -independent o f the project;&#13;
(d) the requirement o fthe programto follow internationalnorms and guidelines, which are generally&#13;
     prepared under the leadership o f these organizations&#13;
(e) capacity constraints within the Government system, and;&#13;
(0 the emergencynature oftheproblemwhichwarrants arapidreactionandresponse time, difficult to&#13;
     envision under the existingGovernment rules andprocedures. For instance, FA0would support the&#13;
     implementation o f the training activities and the provision o f selected TA under the animal health&#13;
     component (Surveillance, Prevention and Containment, Strengthening Laboratory Capacity and Field&#13;
     Vetennary Service, Communications).&#13;
&#13;
UNICEFwould be responsible for cross-cutting communication activities, which do not neatly fall into&#13;
human health or animal health, thus warranting an institutional home other than MoHP or MoAC; and&#13;
possibly the procurement o f certain vaccines and drugs.&#13;
&#13;
WHO would support the implementationo f surveillance strengthening under the human health&#13;
component -through the existing surveillance network o f Immunization Preventable Diseases (a WHO-&#13;
implementedproject), which i s proposed to be developed as an integrated surveillance system. WHO&#13;
would also help carry out the needs assessment for the Referral Hospital, and the technical assistance for&#13;
the designand supervision o f BSL-3 laboratories, and the procurement o f certain vaccines and specialized&#13;
drugs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       63&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
D.FrequencyofProcurementSupervision&#13;
&#13;
Inadditionto the priorreview supervision to becamed out fromBankoffices, the capacity assessmentof&#13;
the ImplementingAgency has recommended three procurement supervision missions duringthe first year&#13;
and two missions a year thereafter to visit the field and to carry out post review o fprocurement actions.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Both the Animal Health and Human Health components have implications that tngger environmental&#13;
safeguard policies. The disposal o f culledpoultry, the clean up o f infected areas and control o f&#13;
surrounding areas inthe case o fAnimal Health, and disposal o f laboratory and health care wastes inthe&#13;
case o f Human Health, trigger the WorldBank Safeguard Policy on Environmental Assessment. The&#13;
Avian Influenza Control Project i s assessedas a B-category project. Measures will be taken to mitigate&#13;
these enmronmental impacts by requiring an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) be prepared for&#13;
boththe Animal Health and Human Health components. Inthe case o f the Human Health a Health Care&#13;
Waste Management Plan already exists under the Health Sector Program and this will incorporated pnor&#13;
to commencingoperation. The Animal Heath EMPwas finalized prior to appraisal. Other than&#13;
EnvironmentalAssessment there are no Safeguard Policiestriggered.&#13;

&#13;
2.       SocialAnalysis&#13;
&#13;
(i)      The mainbeneficiaries ofthe project. Who are they? How many?&#13;
&#13;
The main beneficiaries o f the Avian Influenza Control Project are commercial or industnal poultry&#13;
producers and backyard poultry producers. The industrial poultry producers include 76 hatcheries, 101&#13;
registered feed mills, 150 organised integrated layer farms, 30 integrated boiler farms, eight meat&#13;
processing industries, six poultry medicine producers and more than 10,000 small-scale (i.e. less than 500&#13;
birds) producers and associated industries. While accurate data on the number o f backyard poultry&#13;
producers are not readily available it i s estimated that there are in the region o f two million producers&#13;
with some five to ten birds per producer. The majonty o f these producers mightbe considered "poor" in&#13;
as far as they rely on poultry production for subsistence or for sale for small amounts o f cash income. As&#13;
such, an outbreak o f avian influenza would have disproportionately negative impacts upon the poor.&#13;
&#13;
(ii)     Have the beneficiaries been consulted on the project?Please describe.&#13;
&#13;
Yes, representatives o f the industrial poultry producers have been consulted on the Project. DuringWorld&#13;
Bank preparations in April 2006, a meeting was held with international and national NGOs and industry&#13;
poultry representatives, to provide information and receive feed back on issues on preparation o f the&#13;
Project. While it was not feasible to consult backyard poultry producers during preparation it i s noted&#13;
below that they will be consulted and involved inthe implementation o f the Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     66&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(iii)    Has the civil society Concerned with the project been consulted? Please describe.&#13;
&#13;
Yes, the civil society concerned with the Project was consulted, in the aforementioned meeting that was&#13;
held with relevant international and national NGOs. A number of issues and perspective were raised&#13;
including the importance o f involving civil society in preparation and implementation o f the Project,&#13;
providing compensation for culled poultry, involving the media in ensuring accurate and timely&#13;
information, focusing on backyard poultry producers and women and children in particular, and&#13;
developingan appropriate communications programme.&#13;
&#13;
(iv)     Will the beneficiaries and NGObe consulted or involved inthe implementation of&#13;
 the project'?Please explain.&#13;
&#13;
Yes, the beneficiaries including industrial and backyard poultry producers, and NGOs, will be consulted&#13;
and involved in the implementation o f the Project. The Project will consult with industrial poultry&#13;
producers, and backyard poultry producers, particularly women and children, by requiring then-&#13;
involvement in the verification o f culled poultry and compensation payment meetings, and by ensuring&#13;
the careful targeting o f producers and direct involvement o f NGOs in implementation o f the&#13;
communication programme.&#13;
&#13;
(v)      Does the project require that people have to be resettled to other areas or is their&#13;
 livelihood affected negatively by the project? Yes [ ] or No [XI.&#13;

ExecutiveSummary ofHealthSector Environmental ManagementPlan&#13;
BriefProjectDescription&#13;
&#13;
The Government o fNepal i s committed to bnngingabout tangible changes inthe health-sector&#13;
development process. The aim i s to provide an equitable, highquality health care system for the Nepalese&#13;
people. The SecondLong-Term Health Plan 1997-201 7 seeks equitable access to quality health care for&#13;
all people. Nepal's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), the TenthPlan 2002/3-2006/7, addresses&#13;
social inclusion- aiming to bnngthe poor and marginalized groups into the mainstream o f development,&#13;
and stresses strategic cross-cutting approaches to: (a) redefiningthe role o f the State, and limitingpublic&#13;
interventions; (b) enlisting the private sector to play a leadingrole together with NGOs incomplementing&#13;
government efforts in service delivery; (c) promoting community participation inand management o f&#13;
activities at the local levels; and (d) accelerating the decentralization process. The MediumTerm&#13;
ExpenditureFramework (MTEF) accords highest pnority to Essential Health Care Services (EHCS). It&#13;
proposes a redirectiono fpublic spending towards EHCS and away from tertiary care and lower pnority&#13;
services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       67&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
A senes o f stakeholder consultations andnumerous studies were commissionedto develop a sector-wide&#13;
approach to health development. The process culminated inthe Health Sector Strategy -An Agenda for&#13;
Change and the drafting o f the Nepal Health Sector Program    - Implementation  Plan (NHSP-IP) 2003 -&#13;
07, which reinforce the above nationalpolicies and apply them to the sector. These policies are consistent&#13;
intheir emphasis on(i)   pnoritization o f the EHCS and redirection o fpublic resources to primary care; (ii)&#13;
strengthened sector management and service delivery; (iii)   targeted attempts to reach the poorest and&#13;
marginal groups; (iv) decentralization to local bodies; and (v) public-private partnerships.&#13;
&#13;
The NHSP-IP envisions the improvement o f the health status o fthe entire Nepalese populationby&#13;
ensunng equal opportunity to quality health care services through an effective health system. It i s&#13;
consistent with the HSS, and Nepal's Poverty Reduction Strategy as reflected inthe Tenth Five Year&#13;
Plan. Other documents that have guided the development o fNHSP-Ip are the National Health Policy,&#13;
1991and the Second LongTerm Health Plan (1997-2017). The main reform actions identified under&#13;
NHSP-IP are (a) prioritized allocation o fresources and efforts to ensuring access to EHCS, especially for&#13;
the poor and vulnerable; (b) decentralization o fthe management o f health services delivery to the local&#13;
bodies; and (c) promoting Public-Pnvate Partnerships (PPP) to increase access to and quality o f services.&#13;
NHSP-IP also identifies specific results from the reform measures: such as better value for clients from&#13;
their out-of-pocket health care expenditures; assured access to EHCS for the poor and vulnerable; greater&#13;
efficiency o fpublic health services; and more effective monitoring and evaluation o f sector performance.&#13;
NHSP-IP i s pragmatic inits expectations for the EHCS: it recognizes the greater influence o f the ncher&#13;
population groups on public policy and their increasing demand for the higher cost services outside&#13;
EHCS. Thus the plan also addresses how services "beyond EHCS" will be delivered. NHP-IP seeks to&#13;
support the program o f activities plannedby the Ministry o f Health (MOH) for the period July 2004 to&#13;
June 2009 by financing a proportiono fthe MOHbudget, and through related technical support. More&#13;
description o f the program components are described in Section-2 o f this document.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
EnvironmentalAssessment&#13;
&#13;
As perthe environmental regulationo fthe country, the proposedhealthprogramas such does not require&#13;
any EIA to be undertaken. However, as the programenvisages large number o f activities, which can&#13;
either directly or indirectly lead to environmental impacts, an environmental assessment o f the entire&#13;
program has been undertaken. The summary o f findings o fthe Environmental Assessment i s provided in&#13;
the following sections.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
EnvironmentalImpacts&#13;
&#13;
Environmental impacts associated with the health sector program have been identified by examining the&#13;
ways the activities associated with different components o f the program interact with the environment and&#13;
its different components. Out o fthe two components o f the program, component 2 exclusively deals with&#13;
capacity buildingand management aspects. Therefore, no environmental issues are anticipated from such&#13;
activities. Component-1 however has several activities which can either directly or indirectly interact with&#13;
different components o f the environment leadingto environmental issues. The following three key&#13;
environmental impacts have been identified to be associated with the program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         H C W Management&#13;
    0    Use o f hazardous insecticides/pesticides&#13;
         Construction related environmental issues&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     68&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Expansion o f healthcare service delivery is expected to increase the generation of HCW. Improper&#13;
handling and disposal o f HCW has several issues associated with it.Itposes significant nsks to both&#13;
people and environment as they contain infectiousmatenals and other hazardous substances. The&#13;
environmental issues range from increasing the risk o f spreading infections to increasing exposure to&#13;
toxic emissions from poor treatment and disposal practices. Therefore, H C W management i s identified as&#13;
an important environmental issue inthe context o f the program requiring further assessment.&#13;
&#13;
Use o f different types o f insecticides for prevention o fvector borne diseases i s the common practice in&#13;
many countries. While use o f such insecticides do assist inprotecting people from vector borne diseases,&#13;
improper handling and use o f such substances does pose health riskto both general public and persons&#13;
handling such substances. The range o f healthcare services to be strengthened and expanded also includes&#13;
control o f vector borne diseases requiring use o f insecticides/pesticides. Health nsks arising from&#13;
improper use o f such substances i s therefore identified as an issue requiring further assessment.&#13;
The program envisages expanding the health care service network, which i s expected to involve&#13;
construction o f new facilities o f different levels at different locations inthe country. Construction&#13;
activities, ifnot managedproperly, often leadto environmental impacts such as air, water, noise and land&#13;
pollution as well as ecological degradation. The extent o f such impacts largely depends upon the location&#13;
o f such facilities as well as the construction practices followed. Therefore, environmentalissues arising&#13;
from construction activities are identified as an issuerequiring further assessment.&#13;
&#13;
Assessment of Impacts&#13;
&#13;
The three impacts identified were subjected to qualitative analysis and assessment. The impactswere&#13;
analysed against broadparameters such as scale, seventy and duration. The analysis concluded healthcare&#13;
waste management to be the significant environmental problem o f the sector.&#13;
&#13;
H C W M i s an issue associated with all kindso f healthcare facilities including healthcare related&#13;
laboratones, academic andresearch institutionsetc. Such facilities are spread all over the country. The&#13;
impacts associated with improper management o f HCW can damage the environment and affect the&#13;
health o f people both directly or/and indirectly. The stakeholders that get impacted due to improper HCW&#13;
management are many, which include, hospital staff including the workers who handle such wastes; the&#13;
patients and attendants due to improper handling and storage o f wastes within the healthcare facilities; the&#13;
municipal workers due to improper containerization o f HCW; the general public due to improper&#13;
transport, treatment &amp; disposal o f HCW; and the environment, as its quality deteriorates due to improper&#13;
treatment &amp; disposal.&#13;
&#13;
The present practice o fHCW management inalmost all the healthcare facilities inthe country is very&#13;
poor barring few piecemeal efforts to improve the situation. The problems range from lack o f awareness&#13;
to technical and financial constraints. Developing and implementing a strategy and action plan i s&#13;
therefore considered as the mitigation measure for this critical issue. The EA has therefore recommended&#13;
a larger study as part o f the EA, to develop a strategy and Action Plan to achieve gradual improvement in&#13;
HCWM.&#13;
&#13;
Mitigation Measures: Based on the recommendation o f the EA study a detailed review o fthe HCWM&#13;
across HCFs inthe country was undertaken. As part o f the study a review o f all earlier relevant studies&#13;
were undertaken and visits were undertaken to several HCFs. The study found that none o fthe HCFs have&#13;
fullproofHCWMsysteminplace andrecommended a strategic approachto improve the situation.&#13;
Salient features o f the recommended strategy and Action Plan are provided below.&#13;
&#13;
The HCWM Strategy andAction Plan&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         69&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Based on the recommendations o f the H C W Mreview study, a strategy and action plan has been&#13;
developed inconsultation with other MOH, DOHS and its various divisions, MOPE, NHRC ,the private&#13;
agencies, donor agencies, NGOs and general civil societies. Key elements o fthe strategy for improving&#13;
H C W M are the as:&#13;
&#13;
         Formulation o f a vision &amp; policy&#13;
         Creationo f appropriate institutional framework&#13;
         Buildingawareness andcapacity at vanous levels&#13;
         Creatingappropriate legalh-egulatory framework&#13;
         Targetingphasedimplementationo f HCWMprograms inhealthcare facilities&#13;
         Encouraging private sector participation inHCWM&#13;
         Makingbudgetary provisions for H C W M&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Improving HCWMrequires significant efforts at various levels rangingfrom creating awareness at grass&#13;
root level to formulating policy/regulation to improve HCWM. Accordingly a time bound action plan has&#13;
been developed inline with the recommended strategy. The key activities included inthe actionplan are&#13;
the following:&#13;
&#13;
         Establishment o f a HCWMco-ordinating agency at the centre&#13;
         Making specific budgetary allocation for H C W M inthe overall healthbudget&#13;
         EnactingHCWMlegislation&#13;
         Developing o f H C W MPolicy and guidelines&#13;
         Disseminationo f HCWM Policy and guidelines to all stake holders&#13;
         Detailed feasibility study o f various technical options&#13;
         Establishment o f a fundingmechanism for H C W M activities&#13;
         Establishing a H C W Information Management System&#13;
         ImplementingHCWMprogram&#13;
         Monitoring and evaluating the HCWMprogram.&#13;
&#13;
Cost associated with implementationo f the Action Plan has been estimated. The implementation o f the&#13;
Action Plan and actual improvement inHCW management and its progress will be monitored and&#13;
analyzed. Detailedmonitoring plan inthis regardhas been developed.&#13;
&#13;
Consultation&#13;
&#13;
Findingso fthe H C W Mreview study were discussed with several Govt. departments, largenumber o f&#13;
private organizations and NGOs. The inputs and comments receivedduring such discussions were&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The overall objectives of the Nepal
            Avian Influenza Control Project are to minimize the threat
            posed by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) to humans
            in Nepal by controlling such infections among birds,
            especially domestic poultry, and preparing for, controlling,
            and responding to possible human infections, especially an
            influenza epidemic and related emergencies. The project
            components include: animal health - this component will
            support national prevention and control strategies; human
            health - this component aims to prevent a human influenza
            epidemic caused by HPAI, project management - this component
            will support the strengthening of public agencies for the
            coordination and management of the Project; and
            communication - this programme is cross-cutting and
            underpins both the animal health and human health components
            of the project.
