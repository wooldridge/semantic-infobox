This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission which visited Cambodia from January 23&#13;
to February 3, 1995. The mission was comprised of Messrs./Mmes. Enrique Crousillat (Mission Leader,&#13;
EAIIN), John Irving (Power Engineer, EAIIN), Sumila Gulyani (Resettlement Specialist, ASTHR) Emilia&#13;
Battaglini (Economist, IENPD) and P.T. Venugopal (Financial Analyst, consultant). Other important&#13;
contributions to project preparation were made by Lars Lund (Resettlement Specialist, ASTHR), Yaacov Ziv&#13;
(Environment Specialist, ASTEN) and Peter Cordukes (Financial Analyst, IENPD). The report was reviewed&#13;
by Messrs. Hernan Garcia (IENPD) and Robert Taylor (EA21E) as peer reviewers. Mines. Hamideh Keyhani,&#13;
Theresa Gamulo and Bobbie Brown assisted in the processing of the report. It was cleared by Messrs.&#13;
Callisto E. Madavo, Director, EAI, and J. Shivakumar, Chief, EAIIN.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I. The Energy Sector&#13;
A. Overview&#13;
1.1  The Kingdom of Cambodia, with an area of 180,000 km2 and a population of&#13;
around 10 million, is one of the poorest countries in the world: per capita gross domestic&#13;
product (GDP) is US$200. The largest city is Phnom Penh, the capital, with a population&#13;
of about 800,000. After a long period of war and political disruption, the Government has&#13;
made impressive progress on the macroeconomic front; high inflation has been brought&#13;
under control, the exchange rate stabilized and growth has been relatively strong -- official&#13;
data show real GDP growth of 4.1% in 1993 and 4.0% in 1994. This improvement is&#13;
associated also with the introduction of market reforms and the political security provided&#13;
by a United Nations intervention that allowed the election and establishment of a coalition&#13;
government, business activities to increase and foreign investment to begin flowing into&#13;
the country. Nevertheless, progress is threatened by a breakdown of basic infrastructure,&#13;
including the power supply, which was virtually destroyed in past years.&#13;
1.2   All the commercial energy used in Cambodia is imported. Based on customs&#13;
collections, imports estimated for 1993 were 75,000 tons (t) of fuel oil, 126,000 t of&#13;
diesel, and 88,000 t of petrol, for a total of 289,000 t. Kerosene and liquefied petroleum&#13;
gas (LPG) are also imported, although in smaller quantities. About 40% of fuel goes to&#13;
industry and transport, 35% to electricity generation and 25% to agriculture.  It is&#13;
estimated that 75% of petroleum products are consumed in Phnom Penh and the&#13;
surrounding areas.&#13;
1.3   Until now, no fossil fuels have been developed and little is known about the extent&#13;
of resources. However, experts generally agree the country could have a significant&#13;
amount of natural gas and a modest amount of oil. There is considerable interest in oil&#13;
prospecting and three exploration contracts are currently under implementation through&#13;
production-sharing agreements: the Government is a joint venture partner with the license&#13;
operator. Licenses are issued by the Department of Geology of the Ministry of Industry,&#13;
Mines and Energy (MIME). Oil is imported through the ports of Phnom Penh and&#13;
Sihanoukville. Diesel and fuel oil are imported by the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) for&#13;
use by Electricite' du Cambodge (EDC) and other generating facilities.  Some&#13;
municipalities also purchase diesel from the private sector to generate electricity. Private&#13;
oil companies import fuel for the transport sector. Oil products for both EDC and private&#13;
companies are delivered to the MOC storage facility in Phnom Penh.&#13;
1.4   Rural energy is produced largely from wood and charcoal (approximately 88% of&#13;
the population lives in rural areas). FAO and UNTAC estimate that wood is harvested at&#13;
the rate of 6 to 8 million cubic meters per year and that 90% is used for fuel. Rice husks&#13;
are also used as an energy source.&#13;
1.5   The organizational framework of the energy sector was changed when the current&#13;
administration took office. The MIME was established in 1993 with the following&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
responsibilities: (a) planning, formulating policy, regulating and auditing the energy sector;&#13;
(b) generating and distributing electricity; and (c) coordinating energy projects (including&#13;
donor activities). EDC is the main government entity and the largest organization in the&#13;
sector. However, the private sector is substantially involved in supplying various energy&#13;
forms. Energy sector participants and ownership are summarized in Table I. 1.&#13;

Energy Sector Policy&#13;
1.6   The Government's ultimate objective is to rebuild the country, sustain its&#13;
development, and realize full economic potential. To achieve this, its energy policy aims&#13;
at: (a) providing an adequate supply of low-cost energy throughout the country; (b)&#13;
ensuring a reliable, secure electricity supply at prices that facilitate investment; (c)&#13;
encouraging exploration and environmentally and socially acceptable development of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
energy resources to supply needs of all sectors; and (d) encouraging the efficient use of&#13;
energy and minimizing environmental effects resulting from energy supply and use. While&#13;
this policy addresses medium- to long-term issues, short-term Government objectives&#13;
focus on restoring an adequate energy supply as soon as possible.&#13;
B. The Power Sector&#13;
1.7   Electricity supply, which was previously a function of the municipal councils in&#13;
Phnom Penh and provincial cities, is now the responsibility of EDC, a nationwide utility&#13;
reporting to, and operating under the supervision of, the MIME.&#13;
1.8   Electricity is generated through small isolated thermal systems that are mostly&#13;
diesel fired. By far the largest is in Phnom Penh, where consumption accounts for more&#13;
than 85% of the national total. At the national level, electricity use was approximately 26&#13;
kWh per person per year in 1994, one of the lowest levels in Asia (average consumption&#13;
among countries of the region is 815 kWh per capita, while in Thailand and Vietnam&#13;
consumption per capita reaches 980 kWh and 110 kWh, respectively). In Phnom Penh,&#13;
only 25 MW (of the total 71 MW installed capacity, including several very old plants) are&#13;
available for normal operations and do not meet the city's demand, which is estimated at&#13;
55-60 MW. Thus, if Cambodia is to sustain moderate economic growth, Phnom Penh's&#13;
power shortage needs to be resolved. To this end, part of the city's generating plants are&#13;
being refurbished, and various new generating sets are being installed, with the support of&#13;
several donors. However, this additional capacity of about 40 MW will be insufficient to&#13;
meet future demand and provide a reliable supply. Thus, the Government decided to&#13;
expand generation through direct private participation. A power purchase agreement for a&#13;
35 MW diesel plant was signed recently and generation additions beyond 1998 are being&#13;
assessed. Sector indicators and further data on installations are given in Annex 1.&#13;
1.9   Approximately 60% of Phnom Penh's distribution network is underground. The&#13;
system is old and needs to be renovated. Although the older 4.4 kV sections are being&#13;
repaired, newer parts (15 kV which account for about 70% of the total) are also in poor&#13;
shape and just minimally maintained. Therefore, the network is expected to suffer from&#13;
interruptions, failures and high losses (currently around 35-40%) until it is rehabilitated.&#13;
1.10  At present, 148 wholesalers distribute low voltage (LV) power, obtaining a&#13;
metered supply from EDC at the distribution substations and selling to approximately&#13;
43,000 individual customers. Although this arrangement relieves EDC from the usually&#13;
cumbersome retail operation, it is also a main cause of high technical losses and financial&#13;
problems (para. 2.11). This arrangement needs to be reviewed.&#13;
1.11  Power outages are so acute that economic activities and essential services (such as&#13;
water treatment and pumping, telecommunications, etc.) are severely curtailed. As a&#13;
result, many consumers have installed their own generating units (estimated to be above&#13;
100 MW) at high investment and operating costs. Obsolete equipment accounts for only&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
part of the sector problems. EDC's financial situation constitutes another constraint.&#13;
Although electricity tariffs are relatively high -- 245 and 350 Riel/kWh (9.8 and 14&#13;
US.cents/kWh) for wholesale and retail customers respectively -- steep production costs,&#13;
high losses and a poor collections record have caused EDC to run a large cash deficit in&#13;
past years, covered by the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF).&#13;
1.12  The sector's maladies go beyond its poor technical and financial performance.&#13;
EDC is a very weak utility that lacks skilled management and technical staff, and is at the&#13;
same time over-staffed. A large part of the problem stems from past policies which treated&#13;
the power sector as a public service instead of a commercial operation. Consequently, the&#13;
Government's role was not limited to making policy but included direct intervention in&#13;
daily operations. This situation has yet to improve. The sector's new organization&#13;
mandates that EDC will report directly to the MIME; thus apparently lacking the&#13;
autonomy it needs to operate the utility efficiently. Also, it gives the MIME multiple roles&#13;
-- as policy maker, regulator and operator -- that create a conflict of functions. The&#13;
Government is aware of these problems and is committed to introducing reforms that will&#13;
commercialize the sector and attract direct private investment (paras. 2.3 and 2.18).&#13;
1.13  The World Bank is executing a UNDP-funded technical assistance (TA) project&#13;
for the power sector. It mainly offers support for management and training of EDC and&#13;
MIME staff, including also initial efforts in identifying a viable organizational and&#13;
regulatory framework, a medium-term investments study and formulating a human&#13;
resources master plan. The effort has already made modest but significant progress&#13;
toward improving EDC's management and considerably reducing its drain on public&#13;
finances.&#13;
Demand Forecast&#13;
1.14 If Cambodia is to achieve a moderate economic growth of 7.5% per annum, power&#13;
demand would rise at a faster rate, particularly in Phnom Penh, where commercial and&#13;
domestic consumption is expected to grow rapidly when suppressed demand picks up. A&#13;
desegregated forecast of expected sales in Phnom Penh was prepared by EDC consultants&#13;
from the present to the year 2009. Forecasts for the initial years in all sectors were based&#13;
on energy survey data and, in the absence of reliable statistical information, on data from&#13;
other Asian cities. The forecast takes into account estimated high levels of suppressed&#13;
demand and real increases in GDP.&#13;
1.15  Forecasts indicate that residential consumption will continue to drive load growth,&#13;
accounting for approximately 80%  of total demand.  A rapid increase in domestic&#13;
customers is expected to occur in 1996 and 1997, as the system is rehabilitated and&#13;
demand is met. Commercial load is also expected to grow rapidly over the next seven&#13;
years as commercial development accelerates. While demand from the manufacturing&#13;
sector may be insignificant initially, it is also expected to grow quickly in the latter years of&#13;
the forecast. Growth in the government sector is expected to be modest both in terms of&#13;

summarized below.&#13;

1.16  Early high growth rates are explained by the large amount of suppressed demand,&#13;
currently estimated at 40% of gross generation. However, these will drastically decline&#13;
after 1996 as new generating capacity is made available.  Peak demand, including&#13;
suppressed demand, is expected to increase from 55-60 MW at present (of which only&#13;
about 25 MW is met) to around 70 MW in 1998, 100 MW in 2001 and 160 MW by the&#13;
year 2009. Detailed results of the power demand forecast are presented in Annex 2.&#13;
C. Power Sector Strategy&#13;
1.17  The Government has issued an energy sector position paper that proposes to enact&#13;
a new power sector law favorable to private participation and to establish EDC as an&#13;
autonomous corporation possessing a separate juridical personality.  IDA and other&#13;
donors are supporting the Government efforts in implementing a power sector strategy&#13;
aimed at:&#13;
Re-establishing an adequate supply of electricity nationwide, as soon as possible;&#13;
Strengthening the sector's managerial and implementation capability, to ensure the&#13;
effectiveness and sustainability of current and future operations;&#13;
Creating the appropriate environment needed to promote a sustained, efficient and&#13;
environmentally sound growth and operation of the sector, open to competition&#13;
and private sector participation.&#13;
To this end, it will address short-term and medium-to-long-term issues associated with&#13;
investments, institutions and reforms. The Government is aware of the need to proceed&#13;
in all areas, since it would not be productive to install new facilities unless measures are&#13;
taken to improve EDC's financial and technical performance. The following measures are&#13;
being launched with assistance of the donors community and the private sector:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
Supporting investments.. Phnom Penh's generation capacity will be expanded and&#13;
the distribution system rehabilitated with assistance from the ADB, Japan&#13;
International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and IDA and direct private investment;&#13;
the rehabilitation will be supported by the proposed project. In addition, ADB is&#13;
supporting investments for power generation in the provincial towns of Siem Reap&#13;
and Sihanoukville. The Government is also seeking private investment for similar&#13;
efforts in other provincial towns.&#13;
Strengthening institutions.  The present management support system for EDC&#13;
(provided through UNDP technical assistance) will be continued and its billing and&#13;
revenue collection system improved. EDC will also receive donor support (from&#13;
ADB and IDA) to establish project implementation units, including an&#13;
environmental unit, and staff training.&#13;
:Reforming the sector. IDA is supporting MlME's preparation of an Electricity&#13;
Act and statutes to establish EDC as a separate juridical entity. Further IDA&#13;
support will include TA for defining a suitable structure for the sector and the&#13;
utility, and setting up an appropriate regulatory framework, including the&#13;
establishment of a regulatory authority for the sector (para. 3.8).&#13;
1.18  In the short-term, these efforts will mean revising the sector's institutions and&#13;
financial relationship with the Government (with respect to autonomy and subsidies) as&#13;
well as altering arrangements, such as with wholesalers. In the medium-to-long term,&#13;
actions in these areas will create the structural and regulatory conditions that will promote&#13;
competition and direct private sector involvement. The project includes a TA component&#13;
to support the strategy (paras. 3.7-3.8).&#13;
D. Past Bank Group Involvement in the Sector&#13;
1.19  There have been no previous direct IDA operations in the power sector in&#13;
Cambodia. However, the ongoing IDA credit for the Emergency Rehabilitation Project&#13;
(ERP) contains an infrastructure component, including an addition of 10 MW generating&#13;
capacity in Phnom Penh. Two main lessons have been learned from this ongoing operation.&#13;
First: public entities' implementation capacity is extremely weak; and Second: local ownership&#13;
is an essential condition to guarantee an effective implementation of projects. These lessons&#13;
have been incorporated in the preparation of the project. Accordingly, a TA component will be&#13;
provided to strengthen EDC's implementation capability, and the project has been designed in&#13;
close coordination with EDC staff, including an early preparation of bidding documents.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
E. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
1.20  The policies and programs pursued by the Government and supported by the&#13;
project are substantially in compliance with the Bank's policy for the power sector. The&#13;
project fits well with the IDA's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS, Report No. 14465-&#13;
KH) presented to the Board on June 8, 1995. As discussed in the CAS, the Bank's&#13;
support to Cambodia for the next year will focus on: (a) assisting the Government to&#13;
strengthen its capacity in setting clear priorities and implementing development programs;&#13;
(b) carrying out further analytical work; and (c) supporting critical measures that will have&#13;
a significant and quick impact within each sector. The project is consistent with all of the&#13;
above mentioned approaches.&#13;
1.21   Public participation in the power sector is justified because of the critical situation&#13;
of power supply and the widespread impact of the sector on economic development and&#13;
public welfare. Cambodia's investment requirements in power are large (above US$170&#13;
million in the medium-term, para. 2.17). While IDA can only finance a fraction of these&#13;
needs, its participation in supporting urgent distribution investments will help fill a critical&#13;
gap and at the same time will provide enough confidence to help attract funds for&#13;
generation from public and private sources. The Government has stated clearly its interest&#13;
in reforming the power sector, attracting private participation, and strengthening its&#13;
institutions. Through its involvement in financing EDC's program, IDA will be able to&#13;
play a key role in helping the Government in the initial stage of reform, and over time help&#13;
the Government effectively address issues relating to: (a) power sector regulation,&#13;
restructuring and commercialization; (b) institutional strengthening; (c) investment&#13;
planning and resource pricing; (d) environmental discipline; and (e) establishment of a land&#13;
acquisition and compensation policy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
II. The Beneficiary&#13;
A. Background&#13;
2.1   The beneficiary of the proposed credit will be Electricite du Cambodge (EDC), a&#13;
public utility responsible for generating, transmitting and distributing electricity&#13;
throughout Cambodia. EDC was formed in 1958 when three private companies were&#13;
nationalized--Compagnie Franco-Khmire d'Electricit6 (CFKE), Compagnie des Eaux et&#13;
Electricite (CEE), and Union d'Electricite d'Indochine (UTNEDI). Its name was later&#13;
changed to Electricite de Phnom Penh (EDP) to reflect the company's supply of power&#13;
only to that city; recently it was changed back to Electricite du Cambodge, as it was given&#13;
nationwide responsibilities. In practice, EDC uses private contractors to plan, construct,&#13;
operate and maintain power systems outside Phnom Penh, and provides technical support&#13;
to the provincial electricity operations as required.&#13;
2.2   EDC is a wholly state-owned utility, operating under the direct responsibility of&#13;
the Ministry of Industry Mines and Energy (MIME), supervised by the Secretary of State&#13;
for Energy. It is required to coordinate with the MEF on all aspects of operations&#13;
concerning financial issues and with the Ministry of Planning (MOP) on the amount of&#13;
energy to be generated and fuel requirements. EDC directly supplies 1,658 customers,&#13;
broadly categorized as follows:&#13;
Table 11.1 EDC's Customers&#13;

Government                  556                  35                  41&#13;
Embassies                    66                   4                   6&#13;

a' Wholesalers directly serve about 40,000 residential and commercial customers.&#13;
2.3   The Government is committed to reforming the power sector so as to achieve&#13;
more efficient operations and development. To this end, an Electricity Act is being&#13;
prepared that is expected to be presented to the National Assembly this year for enactment&#13;
by June 30, 1996. The law is expected to establish clear principles for operating the&#13;
power industry and defining the functions and powers of each entity. It will create an&#13;
autonomous regulatory body, define the role of an independent public utility and a broad&#13;
system of licenses for power services, and will also establish principles for setting&#13;
electricity tariffs. It is designed to encourage private sector involvement and contains&#13;
provisions for independent power producers (IPP) and, for the long term, a competitive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9 -&#13;
end use power market with transmission lines designated as common carriers. As a result,&#13;
EDC's functions and responsibilities will have to be revised and adapted to the future&#13;
sector structure. Annex 3 presents, within a time frame, a set of ongoing and agreed&#13;
actions for sector reform, including legal measures and complementary technical support.&#13;
B. Organization and Management&#13;
Structure&#13;
2.4   EDC is managed by a director (appointed by MIME), who reports to the Secretary&#13;
of State for Energy. The organization has seven sections (generation and transmission,&#13;
distribution, commerce, administration, projects, planning and corporate finance), each&#13;
headed by a deputy director (see Annex 4 for an organizational chart). The last three were&#13;
recently created to address the utility's project investment needs and are headed by&#13;
expatriates employed under a UNDP-funded Bank-executed Technical Assistance Project;&#13;
they have been at EDC since July 1993. This project involves the three expatriates and 10&#13;
United Nations Volunteer (UNV) specialists who support EDC in technical areas. The&#13;
TA project has concentrated on urgent rehabilitation needs of the power system in Phnom&#13;
Penh and Sihanoukville, training, investment planning, computerization of billing and&#13;
accounting systems, and initial efforts to re-organize EDC. Assistance was also given to&#13;
MIIME to introduce energy planning skills and develop and reorganize the sector as a&#13;
whole. The TA project is funded through July 1995 by the UNDP and the experts are to&#13;
continue for another year, with the support of the Asian Development Bank and the&#13;
project. This TA has already accomplished modest but significant progress in: (a)&#13;
improving EDC's management decision process and planning for the distribution system;&#13;
(b) adjusting tariffs; and (c) improving EDC's collections--by 20%. Thus, its drain on&#13;
public finances has been considerably reduced.&#13;
Personnel and Training&#13;
2.5   The devastation caused by 20 years of military conflict and political strife, together&#13;
with the effects of a centrally planned policy which treated the power sector as a public&#13;
service instead of a commercial operation, have had a negative impact on EDC's staff and&#13;
management capability.  EDC's staff amounts to 1,177 employees.  Generally, its&#13;
managers and other staff are weak. Many senior staff have only a limited appreciation of&#13;
management principles in a market economy. Moreover, most staff are inadequately&#13;
trained and poorly motivated because of extremely low salaries; this will continue until&#13;
realistic salaries are paid. Responsibilities are poorly defined, and authority and reporting&#13;
processes are not clearly established. Consequently, staff often do not understand the&#13;
extent of their responsibilities and do not know to whom to report. There is also evidence&#13;
that EDC is over-staffed. It has 34 customers to each employee, a ratio much lower than&#13;
in neighboring countries (in Thailand, PEA's ratio is 265 customers per employee).&#13;
Further, it does not have the power to hire the professionals it needs or fire redundant or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
inefficient employees; instead, it can only redistribute the existing work force within the&#13;
utility.&#13;
2.6   In order to improve EDC staff performance and develop its manpower potential,&#13;
the ongoing UNDP/World Bank TA project (para. 1.13) has been providing training in:&#13;
(a) management principles; (b) technical skills, for engineers and technicians; (c) English,&#13;
for senior and middle management; and (d) study tours to visit foreign power utilities.&#13;
The TA project also includes a technology transfer program whereby intemational experts&#13;
provide on-the-job training to local counterpart staff.&#13;
2.7   To date, responsibility for staff training within EDC has not been assigned.&#13;
However, a Human Resources Development Master Plan (para. 1.13) has been prepared&#13;
and is being reviewed. Its key objective will be to develop a comprehensive program and&#13;
schedule to train staff in the power sector. To this end, the Master Plan proposes 22&#13;
actions to: (a) expose the senior managers, middle-level managers and supervisors to&#13;
modem utility strategies and practices; (b) train staff in technical activities; (c) address key&#13;
business objectives such as collecting revenues and managing contractors; (d) provide a&#13;
sound recruitment strategy across all areas; and (e) develop training needs analyses,&#13;
performance appraisals and career development. The project will fund a limited part of&#13;
the Master Plan elements. It is expected the effort will be complemented by other donor&#13;
support.&#13;
Operational Performance&#13;
2.8   The intemal turmoil of the past two decades left the infrastructure severely&#13;
deteriorated, a problem aggravated over recent years by a lack of investment. Also, a lack&#13;
of spare parts and a shortage of skilled technicians has resulted in widespread operational&#13;
problems. Maintenance is inadequate and work is often substandard, although the quality&#13;
is improving. Technical losses have been estimated at 15% of electricity generated, which&#13;
is high, given the urban load base. Overall losses, including non-technical losses but&#13;
excluding station use, are estimated to be in the order of 33%. For all the above reasons,&#13;
EDC is able to meet only less than half of the estimated peak demand, and interruptions to&#13;
supply are frequent due to a shortage of capacity, and a lack of maintenance and spare&#13;
parts. Altogether, EDC's poor technical, commercial and financial performance is a cause&#13;
of Government concern. This has caused it to propose a Performance Plan between&#13;
MIME and EDC as a way of monitoring EDC's performance and introducing adequate&#13;
efficiency incentives. Consequently, a two-year plan was agreed on August 9, 1995 a&#13;
summary of which is incorporated in the key performance indicators in Annex 10. This&#13;
Plan sets forth the principal technical, commercial and financial indicators and targets to be&#13;
achieved by EDC, as well as the basic measures to be taken by MIME to assist EDC in&#13;
realizing that achievement. It was agreed at negotiation that the Government shall take all&#13;
action necessary to ensure the satisfactory implementation of the Performance Plan.&#13;
2.9   Consequently, growth in sales has been limited. Sales for the first eight months of&#13;
1994 totaled only 52.3 GWh, while annual sales were expected to reach 82.2 GWh. Also,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
only about 67% of the units produced were billed. A new electricity pricing structure was&#13;
introduced early in 1994, with different rates for electricity wholesalers and direct&#13;
customers. This adjustment was aimed at reducing the wholesalers' margin while also&#13;
keeping end-use tariffs at previous levels. Subject to adjustments for exchange rate&#13;
fluctuations, the new tariff should permit EDC to almost break even, based on the&#13;
production forecast.&#13;
Wholesaling&#13;
2.10  EDC sells some fifty per cent of its energy to 148 wholesalers who are responsible&#13;
for retail billing and collections relating to about 40,000 consumers. While this effectively&#13;
puts the retailing function in the private sector, EDC has been unable to control&#13;
wholesalers effectively. In addition to failing to maintain fully satisfactory collections from&#13;
them, EDC is not able to enforce its authorized retail rate of Riels 350/kWh, it being&#13;
reported that some wholesalers charge rates as high as Riels 600/kWh. EDC operates&#13;
other parts of the LV network, supplying larger customers and those on the outskirts of&#13;
the city.  It directly supplies only 1,658 end-use customers, including government&#13;
agencies, embassies and various residential consumers who, however, account for 50% of&#13;
total consumption.&#13;
2.11   EDC  is also ineffective in exercising control over new  connections and&#13;
maintenance of the low voltage distribution system. The consequent overloading caused&#13;
by the wholesalers, inefficient installations, and their lack of maintenance are major causes&#13;
of the high electrical losses in the system.  The implementation of the distribution&#13;
rehabilitation component of the project will entail the dismantling of wholesalers&#13;
installations (i.e. great part of their installations would be replaced by a new low voltage&#13;
network and consumer connections) and, hence, an opportunity to revise the current&#13;
arrangement. As the distribution system is being rehabilitated, and the wholesalers are a&#13;
main source of inefficiencies, it was agreed at negotiations that EDC will: (i) redefine the&#13;
role of, or phase out, wholesalers prior to the initiation of the low voltage construction&#13;
program; and (ii) prepare an action plan for the implementation of these measures not later&#13;
than March 31, 1996. The implementation of these measures are included also as part of&#13;
the Performance Plan agreed between MIME and EDC (para. 2.8).&#13;
C. Financial Management&#13;
2.12  EDC operates under the direction and supervision of the MIME, and uses&#13;
Government-prescribed  financial accounting  procedures.   However, its financial&#13;
management systems and skills are generally inadequate, especially with respect to the&#13;
foreseen growth in generation and distribution capacity and the large number of customers&#13;
the company is expected to inherit from the wholesalers (as it assumes their functions and&#13;
increases gradually its number of direct customers from 1,658 to about 40,000). Until&#13;
early 1995, the billing and accounting system was manual, thus slowing the processing of&#13;
accounting information. Credit control, while relatively tight, was handicapped by a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12-&#13;
cumbersome, slow system. To improve the process, a computer system was purchased&#13;
under the UNDP Technical Assistance Project and made operational in early 1995. This&#13;
new system, however, will require further upgrading to enable EDC to handle a larger&#13;
number of customers.&#13;
2.13  Collecting money owed from Government agencies has proved very difficult. The&#13;
MEF has made a preliminary agreement with EDC that it will pay the agencies' overdue&#13;
bills. In addition, agreement has been reached with the Government that it will prepare,&#13;
and agree with EDC, on an action plan to collect outstanding accounts receivable by&#13;
February 28, 1996 (para 4.7).&#13;
2.14  Recent years were marked by rapid inflation and a corresponding devaluation of&#13;
the Riel. Although fuel costs rose sharply, EDC did not significantly adjust its tariffs until&#13;
early 1994. This situation was aggravated by its poor collection record and the large&#13;
margin taken by wholesalers who purchased energy at 9.8 UScents/kWh and sold it to end&#13;
users for 14-22 UScents/kWh. Consequently, large and increasing losses were incurred in&#13;
five of the last six years and the Government covered the resulting shortfall. EDC's past&#13;
financial performance and projections are discussed in Chapter IV.&#13;
2.15  Considerable improvements in technology, policies and practices are needed to&#13;
obtain prompt and rational accounting results (that are consistent with generally accepted&#13;
accounting practices). Thus, an upgraded computerized billing and accounting system&#13;
must be adopted as soon as possible, along with a customer management system. The&#13;
project will provide support in continuing ongoing efforts to implement such systems&#13;
(para. 3.7).&#13;
2.16  EDC has no adequate internal audit procedures and is subject to only sporadic&#13;
external audits carried out by the MEF. As EDC is commercialized, it will need to create&#13;
formal internal and external audit procedures. Agreement was reached at negotiations that&#13;
the Government will cause EDC to maintain its accounts in accordance with appropriate&#13;
internationally accepted accounting principles and would submit to IDA the audited&#13;
accounts and the auditor's reports within six months of the end of each financial year.&#13;
D. Capital Requirements&#13;
2.17  Significant capital investment is needed to meet the high level of suppressed&#13;
demand, estimated at approximately 112 GWh per annum. This is about equal to EDC's&#13;
total estimated production for 1994. Investment requirements to re-establish a normal&#13;
power service are estimated at US$170 million (World Bank report No. 12667). The&#13;
Government is aware of the difficulty in mobilizing such amount. Therefore, in January&#13;
1994, MIME asked for expressions of interest for private sector investment in the&#13;
electricity sector. The response was encouraging, and a Memorandum of Understanding&#13;
was signed for new generation. A generation license was granted and a Power Purchase&#13;
Agreement (PPA) was signed with a private consortium in September 1994 to install and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
operate 35 MW of new capacity at the C2 power station. After this successful experience,&#13;
the Government moved to prequalify suitable contractors for IPPs for eight provincial&#13;
towns. However, it is likely that private investors will not respond with much enthusiasm&#13;
until a clear legal and regulatory framework, along with adequate guarantees, are in place.&#13;
As these conditions are met, more than half of the sector's capital requirements would be&#13;
covered by private sources (para. 4.17).&#13;
E. Commercialization and Corporatization&#13;
2.18   The Government is committed to establishing EDC as a separate juridical entity.&#13;
This would be a first step toward its commercialization and subsequent corporatization.&#13;
Accordingly, EDC would be established as a separate utility to develop, generate, transmit&#13;
and distribute electric power throughout the country according to its service&#13;
responsibilities as defined by law, statutes and regulations.  It would operate as a&#13;
commercial business, organize its production and operations according to market demand,&#13;
pay taxes, and set its personnel and salary policies. IDA is currently supporting the&#13;
Government in achieving this target through the provision of technical assistance for the&#13;
preparation of EDC's articles of association and related constituent documents.&#13;
According to the Government's plans, EDC would be expected to prepare, build, own,&#13;
finance, lease and operate power generation and transmission facilities, as well as contract&#13;
with third parties for, among other things, the purchase of power, and licenses for&#13;
distribution and transmission.  In addition, short-term  Government plans consider&#13;
expanding generation through the direct participation of independent power producers&#13;
(IPPs), with EDC keeping direct responsibility for distribution and retail sales. Agreement&#13;
was reached at negotiations that failure of any of the following events to take place by its&#13;
respective specified date will entitle IDA to suspend Credit disbursements: that EDC will&#13;
be established as an autonomous entity possessing a separate juridical personality with&#13;
attributes, powers and responsibilities satisfactory to IDA not later than December 31,&#13;
1995; that the Electricity Act would be enacted not later than June 30, 1996, in form and&#13;
substance satisfactory to IDA; and that an autonomous regulatory body for the power&#13;
sector would be established not later than September 30, 1996.&#13;
2.19. EDC would have a Board of Directors which would be responsible for managing&#13;
and operating the company through its Director General. The Board would be composed&#13;
of members of the Government and the business community to reflect balanced expertise;&#13;
it shall include at least one engineer, one accountant and one lawyer. Implementing the&#13;
program will require external TA. Accordingly, the project will support the Government&#13;
by providing consultancy services to define the best structure for the utility and the sector,&#13;
as well as to prepare a plan to commercialize EDC and formulate a regulatory framework&#13;
consistent with the proposed structure (para 3.7 and Annex 3). Further support will be&#13;
provided by other donors through the services of a power utilities management expert&#13;
who will advise the Board. Agreement was reached at negotiations that a duly qualified&#13;
advisor to the EDC's Board will be recruited according to terms of reference agreed with&#13;
IDA. Proposed terms of reference for these services are given in Annex 13.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
III. The Project&#13;
A. Objectives&#13;
3.1   The main objectives of the project, which has been designed to be consistent with&#13;
the Government's power sector strategy (para. 1.17), are to support the rehabilitation&#13;
urgently needed for Phnom Penh's distribution system as well as the Government's initial&#13;
efforts to strengthen sector institutions.  Also, the project would help create an&#13;
environment in which the power sector can be developed and operated efficiently,&#13;
including the involvement of the private sector. To this end, the project will finance&#13;
priority investments and provide much needed TA. The project will be implemented along&#13;
with other investment programs supported by the ADB and bilateral agencies from Japan&#13;
and France, among others.&#13;
B. Description&#13;
3.2   The project would include the following components:&#13;
(a) Rehabilitation of Phnom Penh's distribution system comprising:&#13;
(i)    Construction of about 23 km of 1 15 kV transmission circuits around&#13;
the perimeter of Phnom Penh to connect three new primary&#13;
11 5/22kV substations;&#13;
(ii)   Construction of about 100 cct-km  of 22 kV underground and&#13;
overhead lines, 300 km of low voltage lines, 40 MVA of distribution&#13;
transformers, 20 MVAr power factor correction equipment and about&#13;
40,000 consumer connections;&#13;
(iii)  Provision of support facilities, including tools and equipment,&#13;
communications for system operations, storage areas and logistics&#13;
controls; and&#13;
(iv)  Improvement of environmental and safety conditions at existing&#13;
power plants.&#13;
(b) TA comprising:&#13;
(i)    Within EDC  -- procurement and engineering, importation of&#13;
management services, strengthening of commercial operations,&#13;
setting up an environmental unit, implementing the land acquisition&#13;
and compensation plan and training EDC staff, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
(ii)   Within MIME -- defining and implementing a new sector structure&#13;
and regulatory framework; and training staff in energy planning.&#13;
Rehabilitation of Phnom Penh Distribution System&#13;
3.3   An in-depth feasibility study undertaken by EDC's consultants financed by the&#13;
Policy and Human Resources Development Fund (PHRD), determined that a new 115 kV&#13;
transmission network is needed to connect the five power stations in Phnom Penh and to&#13;
provide three points of supply to serve the city's 22 kV networks. The system was&#13;
designed to allow for future upgrading in order to accommodate the expected electricity&#13;
growth up to 2005 when demand is expected to reach about 130 MW. The 115/22 kV&#13;
substations were designed to provide space to connect with a future 230 kV connection to&#13;
Vietnam in the east and Sihanoukville in the south. The substations under the project&#13;
would use standardized designs, consistent with practices utilized by neighboring&#13;
countries. The 115 kV lines under the project would use 25m concrete or wood poles,&#13;
constructed along roads, thereby minimizing right of way (ROW) requirements.&#13;
3.4   The distribution system would be constructed to operate at 22 kV, although parts&#13;
could operate at 15 kV until the older equipment is phased out of service. Rehabilitation&#13;
of the medium voltage (MV) system within the city will be completed with underground&#13;
cable (as is now done) so as to minimize visual impact; outer urban areas will be&#13;
reticulated with 22 kV overhead systems on 12m concrete poles. LV networks will be&#13;
constructed with overhead bundled conductor cable systems, as was done under two&#13;
recent pilot projects funded by other sources. Service connections will use concentric&#13;
screened cables to reduce the incidence of illegal connections. New meters will be&#13;
installed in prominent locations on all consumers' premises employing adequate&#13;
mechanisms to make them tamper-free. Installation of the LV and consumer service&#13;
systems will be carried out in conjunction with EDC's renegotiation of commercial&#13;
arrangements with wholesalers responsible for providing domestic and commercial&#13;
electricity services.  Details on project design and implementation arrangements are&#13;
presented in Annex 5.&#13;
3.5   The project will also provide for operations and maintenance equipment including&#13;
communications equipment, vehicles, construction plant and erection tools. It will also&#13;
expand EDC's computer facilities for: (a) project management, monitoring and control of&#13;
implementation; (b) billing systems, to cover up to 80,000 consumers; (c) planning tools;&#13;
and (d) other office equipment as required for commercial and engineering applications.&#13;
Equipment Storage and Logistics Control&#13;
3.6   The project will support the preparation of a suitable site for receiving and storing&#13;
equipment near the C3 power station site. It will contain outdoor storage facilities with&#13;
handling equipment, and indoor facilities for management offices; meter testing facilities;&#13;
and offices for construction and maintenance management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Technical Assistance&#13;
3.7   The TA component was designed to address the most pressing needs of the power&#13;
sector. It aims to: (a) strengthen EDC's technical, managerial and implementation&#13;
capabilities; and (b) support the Government's reforms to create a more autonomous,&#13;
financially viable power sector open to the private sector. The following consultancy&#13;
services will be secured to support EDC:&#13;
(a)   Engineering assistance to support EDC in the implementation of the&#13;
project. This service will focus on strengthening the Project Management&#13;
Unit (PMU) established within EDC to execute this and other projects to&#13;
rehabilitate and expand its power networks. Engineering consultants will&#13;
be required to: (i) help EDC prepare bidding documents for procuring&#13;
materials and equipment; (ii) assist and train its staff in evaluating bids and&#13;
managing contracts for each project component; (iii) arrange for the&#13;
training of EDC staff in the areas of transmission and distribution&#13;
construction management, supervision, and operations and maintenance;&#13;
and (iv) provide technical advisory services as necessary to complete the&#13;
project and operate the plant. Taken together, the services are designed to&#13;
ensure that all aspects of project implementation are coordinated;&#13;
(b)   Management and computer experts, to strengthen commercial operations&#13;
and computerize the accounting, billing and collection services to establish&#13;
a sound basis for revenue; and&#13;
(c)   Experts to assess and define the scope for establishing an environmental&#13;
unit within EDC and implement the project's land acquisition and&#13;
compensation plan.&#13;
3.8   The TA component to support MIME will include: (a) consultant services to help&#13;
identify the most suitable regulatory framework for the power sector (that can provide&#13;
incentives for an efficient, reliable supply of electricity, attract foreign capital and promote&#13;
efficient operations);  (b) the services of a regulatory advisor to support the&#13;
implementation and initial operations of the proposed regulatory agency (the Electricity&#13;
Authority of Cambodia); (c) the services of an energy advisor to the Minister, to develop&#13;
energy policy and implement MIAME's work program; and (d) a training program for&#13;
MIME staff on energy economics, resource management, energy planning, and statistics&#13;
gathering. Annex 13 presents a more detailed description of the TA package, including&#13;
terms of reference and resources to be allocated. Agreement was reached at negotiations&#13;
that consultancy services will be employed according to terms of reference satisfactory to&#13;
IDA.&#13;

C. Cost Estimates&#13;
3.9      The total financing required for the project (including  capitalized  interest during&#13;
construction) is estimated at US$46 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange&#13;
component of US$37 million equivalent (Details of the cost estimate are presented in&#13;
Annex 7). Costs are based on December 1994 price levels. Physical contingencies have&#13;
been assumed at about 10% of the base cost, considering that the project may change its&#13;
scope as the detailed design progresses. Price contingencies are estimated on the basis of&#13;
escalation factors of 5% for local cost components and 2.8% for the foreign ones,&#13;
following Bank guidelines. Table III. 1 summarizes the cost estimates for the project.&#13;

D. Project Implementation&#13;
3.10    The Project will be  implemented  in  accordance  with  a Project Implementation&#13;
Plan. With the exception of the TA component for MIME, EDC will be responsible for&#13;
implementing the project. It will obtain adequate consultant services for management,&#13;
design and procurement activities, as well as for supervising construction. A project team,&#13;
headed by the manager of the Project Management Unit (PMU), has been formed within&#13;
EDC to coordinate and direct the project. The 115 kV transmission lines will be&#13;
constructed and the 115/22 kV substations installed through single-responsibility turnkey&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18-&#13;
contracts. Because the transmission lines will be pole-mounted and routed along roads,&#13;
ROW requirements will be minimal. EDC has already begun to secure land for&#13;
substations. As the amount of land needed is relatively limited, the company has&#13;
flexibility in its choice of location and can be sensitive to local conditions and future&#13;
expansion requirements. Thus, the implementation schedule is unlikely to be affected by&#13;
land acquisition and compensation obstacles (see Annex 6 for the implementation&#13;
schedule).&#13;
3.11   The PMU will establish teams to supervise the construction of the MV and LV&#13;
distribution works. Planning for the MV rehabilitation program will be linked to the&#13;
commissioning of the 35 MW private plant at the C2 site; this will ensure that power can&#13;
be evacuated without incurring contractual penalties. Planning for the LV construction&#13;
will be coordinated with EDC's plans to phase out or change the role of the wholesalers.&#13;
The work will be coordinated by the PMU project manager and several project engineers&#13;
who have experience with construction under bilaterally-financed projects.  Detailed&#13;
surveys, the planning of routes, the selection of equipment and cost estimates will be made&#13;
with criteria established by the staff and consultants.&#13;
Monitoring and Reporting&#13;
3.12  Procedures for monitoring the physical works and financial reports have been&#13;
agreed upon with EDC, which will furnish quarterly progress reports including updated&#13;
charts based on the model used for the project schedule (Annex 6). These procedures are&#13;
reflected in EDC's Project Implementation Plan. During the final year of implementation,&#13;
IDA will draft Parts I and 3 of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR), no later&#13;
than six months after the project is completed. EDC will review them and prepare Part 2&#13;
(the Borrower's perspective) within the next three months.&#13;
Supervision Plan&#13;
3.13   The project will be supervised according to the plan presented in Annex 9. The&#13;
main areas of focus will be: (a) EDC's investment plan and tariffs, to ensure these are&#13;
consistent with macroeconomic changes; (b) compliance with financial covenants to assure&#13;
EDC's financial health as it conducts a large investment program; (c) technical supervision&#13;
and consulting studies, (d) compensation for the transmission line; and (e) reforms in the&#13;
power sector. Bank missions will also help EDC with institutional development activities&#13;
and provide advice on environmental and social issues when needed. Supervision of the&#13;
project will require expertise in power engineering, management techniques, economics&#13;
and financial analysis--all of which is available within the Bank. It is expected that two&#13;
missions a year for three years will be needed, for a total of 35 staff weeks. Key project&#13;
performance indicators that would be used for supervision are given in Annex 10.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19-&#13;
E. Environmental and Social Issues&#13;
3.14   The project's overall environmental impact is expected to be positive, since an old,&#13;
hazardous distribution system will be replaced, energy losses will be reduced and,&#13;
consequently, a large number of inefficient generating units will cease to operate. In&#13;
addition, the project will upgrade the existing power stations in Phnom Penh, improving&#13;
their environmental and safety conditions. Except for compensation associated with the&#13;
construction of the 115 kV transmission line and related substations, no other&#13;
remuneration is envisaged, since all other project components involve existing power&#13;
plants and distribution systems. Accordingly, the project has been classified in the B&#13;
category. The preparation of an Environmental Action Plan for Cambodia is considered in&#13;
IDA's work program for FY97.&#13;
3.15   EDC consultants assessed the project's environmental impact, focusing on: (a)&#13;
route selection and effects of the proposed transmission line and associated substations;&#13;
and (b) clean-up and safety at existing power stations. Social and environmental issues&#13;
were key factors for the selection of the transmission line route and location of&#13;
substations. Overhead 115 kV pole-mounted lines routed along roads will minimize ROW&#13;
requirements. The layout design of the substations would be fairly flexible, and emphasis&#13;
will be placed on aesthetic aspects in their setting and design. Line and substation designs&#13;
will follow internationally accepted safety practices that have a proven record in the urban&#13;
environment. Further, an environmental audit of power stations was carried out and the&#13;
most essential clean-up and safety measures were included in the project (Annex 11).&#13;
3.16   The eventual replacement and disposal of obsolete equipment (such as PCB-filled&#13;
transformers) and environmentally hazardous materials were also addressed. EDC carried&#13;
out a survey on existing transformers and concluded that no PCBs are in service on the&#13;
network.&#13;
Land Acquisition and Compensation&#13;
3.17   The following components will involve land acquisition: two (out of three) grid&#13;
substations and the 23 km transmission line. One substation site will need about 8,000&#13;
square meters of land and will affect nine households; the other will require 1,350 square&#13;
meters of land for an access road and will affect four households. The ROW for the&#13;
transmission line will affect 19 households, and the project as a whole will affect a total of&#13;
32 families, of which 15 houses will need to be relocated.&#13;
3.18   Minimizing the scale of land acquisition was one of the criteria in selecting the&#13;
transmission route and location of sub-stations. The transmission line, which was initially&#13;
set to cross the city, was re-routed and located further away so as to affect fewer&#13;
settlements. Its pole mounted design also helped keep adverse impacts to a minimum.&#13;
Further, given the medium voltage, the line will require a ROW of only about six meters,&#13;
as the cross arm width is about three meters.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
3.19  A detailed survey of the proposed route was completed and base drawings (scale&#13;
1:3000) indicate the structures and property affected by the line. In addition to the&#13;
technical survey, authorities made a baseline survey of the affected population. Further,&#13;
EDC has obtained the Government's clearance on a policy framework and plan for land&#13;
acquisition and compensation. Agreement was reached during negotiations on a timetable&#13;
for the Government's implementation of the Land Acquisition and Compensation Plan and&#13;
on the regular monitoring of the plan's implementation (summary of the Plan and agreed&#13;
timetable are presented in Annex 12). EDC's compliance with such timetable is also part&#13;
of the Performance Plan agreed between MIME and EDC (para. 2.8).&#13;
Implementation and Institutional Strengthening.&#13;
3.20  Given that local agencies and EDC  have little experience dealing with&#13;
environmental and land acquisition issues, the project will provide TA for consultants to&#13;
help EDC (a) define the scope of an environmental unit (to be set up within EDC); (b)&#13;
implement the compensation plan, including the preparation of a Due Process Manual; and&#13;
(c) further develop EDC's policy framework, procedures, and implementation&#13;
arrangements for land acquisition and compensation (Annex 13).&#13;
F. Financing Plan&#13;
3.21  Table III.2 below summarizes the expected financing sources for the project. IDA&#13;
financing would account for about 88% of project costs, covering 100% of the foreign&#13;
component (excluding interest during construction), and about 64% of the local&#13;
component. The IDA credit of US$40 million equivalent would be at the standard terms&#13;
for a 40-year term including a 1 0-year grace period. The Government would retain about&#13;
US$0.8 million towards the TA for MIME. The balance would be fully passed on to EDC&#13;
in two parts, the equivalent of US$6 million as equity contribution, and the remaining&#13;
about US$33.2 million as a subsidiary loan. Agreement was reached at negotiations that&#13;
the Government will enter into a subsidiary loan agreement with EDC, satisfactory to&#13;
IDA, within three months after EDC is established as a separate juridical entity (para&#13;
2.18). It was also agreed that onlending will be in US$ at a variable interest rate equal to&#13;
LIBOR plus one half of one percent, with repayment over 17 years, including a grace&#13;
period of five years.&#13;

G. Procurement&#13;
3.22  With the exception of the provision made for local contractors and stores (para.&#13;
3.23), all contracts financed by the credit for works and goods would be awarded on the&#13;
basis of International Competitive Bidding (ICB) according to IDA procurement&#13;
guidelines. Annex 5 gives a summary of the procurement arrangements.&#13;
3.23  The credit will finance up to 100% of foreign and 70% of local components of the&#13;
supply and installation contracts for the transmission line and substations awarded on ICB&#13;
basis, which will be evaluated allowing domestic preference for contractors.  The&#13;
distribution component involving laying of underground cables and overhead main lines&#13;
estimated at $5.9 million will also be subjected to ICB. Construction of storage facilities&#13;
will be awarded on the basis of National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures&#13;
acceptable to IDA with 100% of foreign and 70% of local components funded by the&#13;
Credit. An amount of $500,000 has been allocated to encourage the development of local&#13;
contractors for which special procedures will be followed. Local contractors who have&#13;
the aptitude and capacity for the distribution components will be invited to register for&#13;
training following advertisement in local newspaper. On completion of the training&#13;
program conducted by EDC, a list of qualified contractors (minimum five) will be&#13;
prepared for participating in the bidding process, following competitive bidding&#13;
procedures. Bidding documents for such procedures will be reviewed by IDA prior to&#13;
release to ensure that terms and conditions are equitable and fair. IDA will finance 70% of&#13;
the costs for this pilot project.&#13;
3.24  In the evaluation of bids for goods following ICB procedures, a domestic price&#13;
margin of preference equal to 15% of the CIF bid price of imported goods or the actual&#13;
customs duties and import taxes, whichever is less, will be allowed for domestic&#13;
manufacturers. Prior IDA review of bid documents and approval of contract awards will&#13;
be mandatory for contracts for goods and works expected to cost the equivalent of&#13;
US$0.5 million or more. This will cover about 90 % of total contract value. Consulting&#13;
services financed by IDA will be awarded according to Bank guidelines for the use of&#13;
consultants. Contracts exceeding US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals&#13;
will require IDA's prior review. Table III.3 summarizes the procurement arrangements&#13;
for the project.&#13;

H. Disbursements&#13;
3.25   Disbursements for the distribution components are expected to begin in early 1996.&#13;
The overall implementation period will be about four years from negotiations. The IDA&#13;
credit would be disbursed against: (a) 100% of foreign expenditures for imported&#13;
equipment and materials as well as related installation works; (b) 100% of local&#13;
expenditures (ex-factory) for locally manufactured items and related installation works; (c)&#13;
70% of local expenditures for materials, equipment and related installation works; (d) 70%&#13;
of construction of distribution works by local contractors (to cover the cost, net of taxes,&#13;
for leased equipment and importation of foreign supervision); and (e) 100% of total&#13;
expenditures for consulting services.  Full documentation would be required for all&#13;
contracts for goods and works valued at US$0.5 million equivalent. Disbursements for&#13;
goods and works valued at less than US$0.5 million would be made on the basis of&#13;
itemized Statements of Expenditure (SOE). The SOE limit for consultant's services&#13;
would be US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for individuals. The documentation for&#13;
SOE supported expenditures would be retained and made available for review by IDA&#13;
supervision missions. A Special Account would be established at the National Bank of&#13;
Cambodia to facilitate these payments. This account would be maintained in US dollars,&#13;
with a limit of US$3 million equivalent.&#13;
3.26   Annex 8 gives the disbursement schedule for the  IDA credit.  The project is&#13;
expected to be completed by June 30, 1999 and the closing date for the Credit would be&#13;
December 31, 1999.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
IV. Finance&#13;
A. Past Financial Performance&#13;
4.1    At present, EDC's financial operations are an extension of the Government's.&#13;
From year to year, the Government provides budgetary support to EDC in order to cover&#13;
its losses and new investment needs. Essentially, EDC's activities in Phnom Penh are not&#13;
large enough for the economy of scale that is needed. The prevailing power wholesale&#13;
tariffs, at around 10 US cents/kWh, on the average, do compare with the tariffs at the&#13;
higher end of the region. The coming years would see fast growth in power consumption.&#13;
As EDC is established as a separate commercial entity, the objective will be to attain&#13;
financial independence, and at the same time endeavor not to raise tariffs in real terms,&#13;
although rationalize them in due time and, ultimately, reduce them. To allow EDC to&#13;
begin its new commercial life without past financial burdens to the extent possible, the&#13;
balance sheet has been reconstituted, subject to the approval of the Government,&#13;
eliminating "inefficient" balances. This is further explained below. As EDC's business&#13;
expands and sales revenues climb, EDC could quickly become self-sufficient in respect of&#13;
cash operating costs and, soon thereafter, achieve full financial viability as measured by&#13;
rates of return and other financial indicators.&#13;
4.2   Financial results of EDC's trading, restricted to its operations in Phnom Penh, for&#13;
the period 1989-1994 are summarized in Table IV. 1. Detailed statements are given in&#13;
Annex 14.&#13;

4.3    EDC's operating losses have risen from Riels 288 million (about $1 million) in&#13;
FY1989 to Riels 10 000 million ($3.8 million) in FY1994, the first year in which&#13;
depreciation was calculated on revalued fixed assets in service. Only in FY1992 was a&#13;
profit made. Fixed assets in service at the end of FY1993 were valued at Riels 49,300&#13;
million ($19 million), thus a return of eight percent would have required an operating&#13;
profit of Riels 3,900 million. Therefore, the shortfall for FY 1994 was about Riels 14,000&#13;
million ($5.4 million). EDC's increasing losses during the last four years are explained by:&#13;
(a) a decline in real tariffs, which remained unchanged throughout great part of that&#13;
period; and (b) an accelerated deterioration of its power generation capability caused by&#13;
maintenance problems and old equipment. The slight improvement of 1994 was due to a&#13;
rise in wholesale tariffs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

4.4   Estimated balance sheets for FY 1993 and 1994 are presented in Annex 14 and&#13;
summarized in Table IV.2. The fixed assets are at valuation in 1994 prices with additions&#13;
at cost.'&#13;

Total Equity &amp; Liabilities             59,227       62,838&#13;
Valuation of Equity&#13;
4.5    The value of the owner's interest in EDC is determined largely by the value of fixed&#13;
assets less any long term debt raised to finance them. In EDC's case, the book value of&#13;
assets in 1993 was seriously below depreciated replacement cost and there was no long&#13;
term debt. Fixed assets were revalued as at December 31, 1993 by EDC consultants,&#13;
using a depreciation replacement cost approach. After allowing for the rundown nature of&#13;
many system assets, the total value is put at almost Riels 50,000 million (approximately&#13;
US$19 million).&#13;
4.6  The other main determinant of assets value is receivables and inventory. Whilst it is&#13;
intended to incorporate EDC as a joint stock company with limited liability, EDC's&#13;
accounts have been reconstituted as at the end of 1993. This included writing off about&#13;
one third of recorded values, including a large but not known proportion of debtors'&#13;
balances dated back to 1983, and capitalizing an amount of Riels 12,000 million recorded&#13;
as payable to the Government. The current valuation of fixed assets has been brought to&#13;
account, and the net result to value the owner's interest at that date, at almost&#13;
Riels 57 000 million ($ 22 million). The whole of this is treated as equity. Given the&#13;
precarious state of EDC's finances, there is no point in attempting to assess an appropriate&#13;
mix of debt and equity. More properly, the aim should be to get EDC's profitability to the&#13;
stage where EDC pays taxes and a dividend to Government and thereby makes funds&#13;
available for reinvestment in other development projects. Agreement was reached during&#13;
negotiations that, not later than June 30, 1996, the Government will record approval of&#13;
EDC's reconstituted and duly audited balance sheet as at December 31, 1995.&#13;
The balance sheet for FY 1993 is a reconstruction based on available information and does not include old, doubtful and obscure&#13;
arnounts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
Accounts Receivable&#13;
4.7   EDC sells almost 50 percent of its energy to wholesalers and bills them about 42&#13;
percent of its revenue. Collection performance is poor and worsening; between 31&#13;
December 1993 and 31 December 1994 collections were only 60 % of sales revenue.&#13;
Accordingly, unpaid accounts are estimated to have increased by Riels 9,200 million&#13;
(US$3.5 million) to Riels 14,700 million (US$5.7 million), approximately 7.3 months'&#13;
revenue. Such position of trade receivables, even after reconstituting the balance sheet of&#13;
EDC, is cause for serious concern. Government agencies are the primary debtors,&#13;
followed by the Municipality, wholesalers and embassies. This issue was discussed with&#13;
the Government. Agreement was reached at negotiations that the Government will take&#13;
all measures necessary to assist EDC to collect the outstanding account receivables, and&#13;
that EDC will reduce these to not more than three months of sales revenue by December&#13;
31, 1998, and to 2.5 months of sales revenue by December 31, 1999. Also, an agreement&#13;
was reached that the Government will prepare, in coordination with EDC, a plan of action&#13;
to achieve these results, satisfactory to IDA, not later than February 28, 1996.&#13;
B. Financial Outlook&#13;
Projected Financial Performance&#13;
4.8   Improvements in EDC's financial performance would require the following: (i) the&#13;
capacity to meet demand for increased quantities of electrical energy; (ii) improved&#13;
generating and distribution efficiencies; and (iii) tariffs to be adjusted to cost escalation.&#13;
The capital investment program supported by multilateral and bilateral agencies and a first&#13;
contract with an independent power producer will provide the necessary generating&#13;
capacity by 1999-2000. The rehabilitation of the Phnom Penh's distribution network will&#13;
also allow to reduce EDC's electrical losses from 1994's 24 % to 15 % during the same&#13;
time, since the project is in fact a major loss reduction program. This improvement would&#13;
be also complemented by a better collection performance made possible through the&#13;
implementation of a modern billing and collection system.&#13;
4.9   The modernization of EDC's billing and collection system would allow EDC to&#13;
take over -- or reach a new type of arrangement for -- wholesale distribution thus enabling&#13;
the utility to capture progressively the large wholesale margin (paragraphs 2.11 and 2.12).&#13;
Additional costs to be incurred to provide an efficient billing, collection and consumer&#13;
accounting and management services should be minimized by redeploying existing staff.&#13;
However, even after allowing for increased earnings in this manner, price adjustments will&#13;
be necessary for some time and it is important that EDC review its rates regularly and not&#13;
less often than annually. Projections of EDC finances indicate that average revenue yields&#13;
per kWh sold expressed in dollar equivalent need to increase at not less than the average&#13;
rate of international inflation during a period of five years. This would mean that rates&#13;
should reflect real increases in oil prices and equipment, as well as variations in the&#13;
exchange rate. Agreement was reached at negotiations that the Government will review&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
not later than October 1, in each year, EDC's investment program and power tariffs in&#13;
consultation with IDA.&#13;
Financing Plan&#13;
4.10   Table IV.3 summarizes EDC's projected cash flows during the period 1995-2003.&#13;
Based on the projected costs and revenues, internally generated funds are expected to&#13;
cover about 45 % of total cash application requirements and about 70 % of projected&#13;
capital expenditures. Details of the capital funds projected to be received are given in&#13;

a.    1995-2003 Riels have been converted to dollars at a single representative rate.&#13;
C. Tariffs&#13;
4.11   EDC's tariff structure includes a single energy rate with no demand charges. The&#13;
tariff system contains rates in both Riels and US.Dollars. The Dollar tariff is higher than&#13;
the Riel tariff and applies generally to foreign firms and embassies. The average revenue&#13;
yield for FY 94 was Riels 292 per kWh (11.4 US.cents). Wholesalers paid Riels 239 for&#13;
energy billed in Riels and Riels 449 for energy billed in US. Dollars. EDC billed most of&#13;
its retail consumers at rates yielding between Riels 326 and Riels 350, but obtained from&#13;
embassies billed in Riels 327, and from those billed in US. Dollars, Riels 546.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
4.12 Through FY91 until early FY94 EDC's rates had remained unchanged. During&#13;
that period average rates to wholesalers were Riels 119 per kWh and to end consumers&#13;
Riels 170 per kWh. Consumers billed in dollars paid a constant value of $0.21 per kWh&#13;
over the same period.&#13;
4.13  The wholesalers are known to charge retail rates considerably higher than the&#13;
authorized retail tariff (para. 2.10).  While this introduces unfair treatment to retail&#13;
consumers, it is also an indication that consumers' willingness to pay may be higher than&#13;
the retail tariff. While EDC is expected to improve its financial performance as: (i) its&#13;
generating capacity is enhanced; (ii) energy losses are reduced; and (iii) collection record&#13;
is improved, it does not necessarily follow that retail rates should be reduced as&#13;
wholesalers' activities revert to EDC. A carefully designed plan for revising the structure&#13;
of tariffs should be prepared before wholesalers' businesses are taken over, or a new&#13;
arrangement is made, so that the required revenue will be progressively earned without&#13;
granting reductions that may have to be reversed soon afterwards. The plan should reflect&#13;
the financing requirements of EDC including the completion of its rehabilitation program&#13;
in Phnom Penh and the expansion of its operations throughout the country, while keeping&#13;
the long term objective of reducing real tariff levels (see para. 4.17). Given the structure&#13;
of the consumer group, composed mainly of a large number of residential and small&#13;
commercial consumers, and the relatively weak billing and collection system, it is not&#13;
recommended that demand charges be introduced in the short term.&#13;
D. Financial Projections&#13;
4.14  Revenue projections have been made based on the following: (i) the sales and load&#13;
forecast; (ii) new generation, transmission and distribution capacities as they become&#13;
progressively available in accordance with the capital investment program; (iii) the&#13;
projected costs of supply and distribution; (iv) the progressive capturing of wholesale&#13;
margins as the distribution system is rehabilitated; and (v) the effect of projected&#13;
international inflation and exchange rates on investment and operating costs. A complete&#13;
set of the assumptions used for these projections is given in Annex 14, including&#13;
commercial conditions for the onlending agreement between the Government and EDC&#13;
(para. 3.21).&#13;
4.15   The main determinants of future costs will be: (i) the investment program; (ii) fuel&#13;
costs; and (iii) the contract(s) entered into with independent power producers. Given the&#13;
Government's policy that future increments of generating capacity are to be built and&#13;
financed by independent producers (para 2.10), the projections assume two further power&#13;
stations being commissioned before 2003 to provide enough energy and adequate security&#13;
of supply at times of peak demand. This results in high fixed costs per kWh delivered by&#13;
the new stations in FYs 2002-2003 and a temporary reduction in profitability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
4.16   Including 2.5%  per year international inflation and a similar devaluation of the&#13;
Riel, average revenue yields are projected progressively to rise 136 % from Riels 292 in&#13;
FY94 to Riels 689 in FY98, including a gradual capturing of the wholesale margin. The&#13;
increase in projected dollar equivalents is 60 % by FY 2000. EDC's projected operating&#13;
results are given in Annex 14, Table IV.4 presents a summary.&#13;

4.17   Apart from  several small generation projects under way, EDC's future capital&#13;
needs are limited largely to rehabilitation and extension of the transmission and&#13;
distributions systems. The need to be able to finance large new borrowings to invest in&#13;
generating capacity has therefore been removed as a result of the Government's policy&#13;
decision to contract with IPPs (para 2.17). This condition, together with the adjustments&#13;
of tariffs along real costs increases, would result in the projected ability of EDC to pay&#13;
income tax beginning in the year 2000 and dividends to its owner from the following year,&#13;
while at the same time accumulating substantial cash holdings for investments and other&#13;
uses. These conditions could also offer the opportunity for achieving the Government's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
ultimate objective, which is to start reducing real tariff levels while keeping an adequate&#13;
quality of service.&#13;
4.18  Cash generation and rate of return should be the driving forces of EDC's financial&#13;
management measures. Accordingly, starting FYl996, EDC should charge tariffs at least&#13;
sufficient to produce revenues that would cover cash operating expenses, debt service&#13;
requirements, net increases in working capital, major repairs expenditures and government&#13;
taxes. It should also be expected that EDC produce annual rates of return on revalued&#13;
assets of not less than 6% in FY1999 and thereafter. This target is less than the prevailing&#13;
and expected opportunity cost of capital in Cambodia over the period under review.&#13;
However, the financial forecasts indicate that the target would be sufficient to enable EDC&#13;
to generate enough internal funds to meet its various obligations and yield financial results&#13;
comparable to those in Table IV.4 above. With a view to maintain an adequate financial&#13;
performance agreement was reached during negotiations that the Government will support&#13;
EDC in taking all measures necessary (including tariff increases) to achieve its financial&#13;
targets. It was also agreed that the Government will cause EDC, for FY96 onward, to&#13;
produce revenues sufficient to cover all its expenses and in FY99 and thereafter, produce&#13;
rates of return of not less than 6%. The two-year Performance Plan agreed between&#13;
MIME and EDC (para. 2.8) includes additional short term financial targets for EDC.&#13;
&#13;

V. Project Justification&#13;
5.1   The current situation of the sector is critical, to the extent that it has become a&#13;
barrier to economic development as severe power shortages are curtailing power&#13;
dependent production and services. The efficient development of the power sector is&#13;
therefore crucial for Cambodia's economic development. Through the provision of capital&#13;
for the rehabilitation of the power system, the project will contribute to sustaining the&#13;
country's economic growth. The project will also improve the efficiency of the power&#13;
sector, both in terms of reducing distribution losses and closing the demand-supply gap,&#13;
thus reducing the economic cost of unserved demand and expensive back-up generation in&#13;
Phnom  Penh.  Finally, the project will contribute towards the strengthening and&#13;
modernization of sector institutions, preparing them to handle effectively the urgent&#13;
requirements of the power system and enabling the environment for a sustained and&#13;
efficient growth and operation of the power sector, open to private participation.&#13;
5.2   The project is an essential part of EDC's least-cost expansion since without the&#13;
rehabilitation of distribution efforts in expanding generation will not yield any benefits.&#13;
The benefits arising from the implementation of this project are primarily: (a) the&#13;
improvement of the reliability of supply to existing consumers; (b) the reduction of system&#13;
losses and increase of transmission and distribution efficiency; and (c) the provision of&#13;
additional distribution capacity to satisfy rapidly growing demand. Improved reliability&#13;
will increase quality of supply and reduce the economic losses from outages and voltage&#13;
fluctuation; loss reduction and capacity increase will allow to increase sales at least cost.&#13;
The decision by EDC to adopt a single medium voltage system (22 kV three phase) will&#13;
enable the old MV networks to be retired over time, reducing losses and increasing&#13;
reliability. It will also permit the rationalization of distribution equipment, resulting in&#13;
more cost effective designs.&#13;
A. Economic Analysis&#13;
5.3   The internal economic rate of return (ERR) of the project is estimated at 21.5%.&#13;
This is a sound rate which reflects the priority of refurbishing the distribution network&#13;
under circumstances of strong demand pressure. This estimate is based on the net benefit&#13;
flow (value of electricity sales less economic cost of supply) of the incremental electricity&#13;
sales attributed to the project (over a six-year period, with one-year time lag), and the&#13;
additional benefits related to the system reliability improvement and loss reduction&#13;
associated to the project. The revenues from incremental sales are computed on the basis&#13;
of the present average retail tariff of 16 US.cents/kWh, ignoring consumer's surplus. The&#13;
cost stream comprises the investment in transmission and distribution under the project,&#13;
the cost of incremental energy purchased and the incremental operation, maintenance,&#13;
billing and administration costs associated with the project.&#13;
5.4   The economic viability of the project was tested against three adverse conditions&#13;
stemming from project risks, namely, delayed procurement and implementation, cost&#13;
overruns and poor operation and maintenance (para. 5.6). It was found that if project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31-&#13;
implementation is delayed by one year, the project would still show a high ERR of 21%.&#13;
The project economic viability would be more sensitive to cost overruns, which in the case&#13;
of a 10% increase in the investment cost, would lower the ERR to 19.3%. In the unlikely&#13;
case of both deviations occurring simultaneously, the ERR would decline to 18.9%.&#13;
Finally, in the case of a poor operation performance reflected in high O&amp;M costs and&#13;
higher energy losses, the project's ERR would go down to 18.7%. In all cases, however,&#13;
the economic performance of the project would remain satisfactory. The project is not&#13;
expected to be sensitive to a lower growth of demand because there is presently a very&#13;
large suppressed demand. A set of results and underlying assumptions for the economic&#13;
analysis are presented in Annex 15.&#13;
B. Project Risks&#13;
5.5   The technologies for all project components are conventional and well proven.&#13;
The basic planning of the distribution system in the area to be served by the project has&#13;
been comprehensively reviewed as part of the project preparation. Detailed project design&#13;
should, therefore, proceed fairly smoothly. The implementation of transmission lines and&#13;
substations is being planned on a single responsibility basis, which should result in a&#13;
speedy execution of the project. In view of the advanced action being taken by EDC in&#13;
acquiring land for substations, this activity is not expected to pose problems in the project&#13;
execution. Delays in making decisions on procurement could cause a delay in the&#13;
execution of the project; however, this activity will be closely monitored by the Bank. The&#13;
risk of load growth not materializing as forecast is minimal, given the development&#13;
potential of the area and the existing large suppressed demand.&#13;
5.6   In summary, project risks are primarily ascribed to the weaknesses of the sector&#13;
institutions. If these weaknesses are not addressed effectively, the project could face&#13;
delayed procurement and implementation, cost overruns and poor operation and&#13;
maintenance. To mitigate these risks, the technical assistance component of the project&#13;
will provide the services of foreign experts to adequately train the local staff, supervise the&#13;
works and control the quality of the results. With regard to the broader institutional&#13;
framework, the Government has demonstrated the willingness to implement reforms to&#13;
create an efficient, autonomous and commercially viable power utility and open the sector&#13;
to private participation; this would indicate that the risk of lack of commitment is low.&#13;
The technical assistance and capacity building component of the project will specifically&#13;
assist the power utility and the Ministry in defining and implementing the reform process.&#13;
5.7   Country risks can be categorized into two types. First, there are security problems&#13;
that make difficult to carry out projects in some rural areas. This type of risk would not&#13;
affect the project since all works are confined to the city of Phnom Penh, where security&#13;
conditions are not a problem. A second distinct risk is political. The current political&#13;
situation is fragile and could change in any number of directions. The project is proposed&#13;
under the assumption that governance will improve as legal reform, civil service reform&#13;
and training programs progress, and the political situation remains stable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

- 33 -&#13;
(j) Take all measures necessary to assist EDC collect its outstanding account&#13;
receivables, and cause EDC to reduce these receivables to not more than three&#13;
months of sales revenue by December 31, 1998, and to 2.5 months of sales&#13;
revenue by December 31, 1999 (para. 4.7).&#13;
(k)  Review not later than October 1 of each fiscal year EDC's investment&#13;
program and power tariffs in consultation with IDA, and thereafter make all&#13;
necessary adjustments (para. 4.9).&#13;
(1)  Support EDC in taking all measures necessary (including tariff increases) to&#13;
achieve its financial targets, and ensure that EDC will produce revenues&#13;
sufficient to cover all its expenses and in FY99 and thereafter, produce rates&#13;
of return of not less than 6% (para 4.18).&#13;
B. Recommendation&#13;
6.2   The aforementioned agreements having been reached, the project would constitute&#13;
a suitable basis for an IDA credit of SDR 25.8 million (US$40 million equivalent) on&#13;
standard IDA terms with maturity of 40 years to the Kingdom of Cambodia.&#13;

Installed Capacity&#13;
Electricity generation in Cambodia is in small isolated systems. By far the largest system is&#13;
in Phnom Penh, where the installed capacity is about 71 MW, of which only 40 MW are&#13;
serviceable. Of this, only about 25 MW is available at present.&#13;
The state of the five existing stations is as follows:&#13;
Station Cl&#13;
Total capacity: 23 MW. All the diesel machines are old with the exception of one&#13;
new 1.8 MW machine supplied by the French Government in 1993. Most of the&#13;
machines are unserviceable. All other old units will need to be retired by the end of&#13;
1995.&#13;
Station C2&#13;
Total capacity: 28 MW. The three existing 6 MW steam turbines have been&#13;
overhauled and are in running order. However, they have been derated, and only&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -                            Annex I&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
two machines are able to be operated at once. Three of the five old 2 MW GM&#13;
diesels at this site are to be moved to Station C3 and overhauled. All are overdue&#13;
for retirement.&#13;
Construction of a new 35 MW IPP plan is to begin shortly at this site.&#13;
Station C3&#13;
Total capacity: 6 MW. The original three diesel machines were restored a year ago,&#13;
but due to lack of running spares, they are again in need of repair. These three,&#13;
together with the three from C2, are to be repaired through ADB and Australian aid.&#13;
All are overdue for retirement.&#13;
Station C4&#13;
Total capacity: 14 MW. Spares for the existing diesel machines are on order and&#13;
these should suffice to keep the machines runmning for about two more years.&#13;
Station CS&#13;
The existing diesel machines at this station have never been commissioned. One is&#13;
to be moved to C4 and commissioned. The others are to be scrapped.&#13;
The first of the two 5 MW JICA-funded machines is due to be commissioned in&#13;
1995, with the second machine coming on-line in 1996.&#13;
Many small privately owned generating sets are in use in Phnom Penh because of the poor&#13;
reliability of the EDC supply. Their number and capacity is not known although it is&#13;
estimated to exceed 100 MW. .&#13;
Distribution system&#13;
The distribution system of Phnom Penh comprises two principal medium voltage (MV)&#13;
levels, 4.4 kV two phase and 15 kV three phase. Approximately 60% of the network is&#13;
underground cable. Some 6.3 kV three phase circuits are also in service but very little.&#13;
The 4.4 kV system comprised approximately 30% of the total, and serves the older part of&#13;
the city. Part of it has been replaced with 22 kV equipment operating at 15 kV at present,&#13;
with assistance from EdF. This will leave 44, 4.4 kV substations in service. Of these, four&#13;
are to be replaced by EDC (using materials supplied under the second stage of the EdF&#13;
project), a further three are to be replaced under the JICA project and 18 are to be replaced&#13;
under the ADB project, leaving 19 requiring replacement.&#13;
&#13;

Low voltage, (LV) distribution is mainly by overhead lines with about one percent&#13;
underground. Distribution substations are mostly in buildings housing MV switchgear,&#13;
transformers and LV distribution equipment.&#13;
EDC is also responsible for the installation and maintenance of street lighting equipment.&#13;
Due to the conflict in the country and lack of funds over many years, and particularly since&#13;
the withdrawal of Russian experts, the condition of the network has deteriorated badly.&#13;
Much of the equipment is old, particularly the underground cables and switchgear. There is&#13;
a need for replacement of much of the equipment due to its age, the unavailability of spares&#13;
for the switchgear and frequent faults on the underground cable system.&#13;
Network records are well kept, considering the recent past situation. A record for each&#13;
ground mounted substation listing modifications has been maintained since 1986.&#13;
Computerisation of the records is required.&#13;

Power Demand Forecast and Expansion Requirements&#13;
A desegregated forecast of expected sales in Phnom Penh was prepared by&#13;
EDC consultants from the present to the year 2009. Forecasts for the initial years in all&#13;
sectors have been based in energy, survey data and, in the absence of reliable statistical&#13;
information, on data from other cities on Asia. The forecast takes into account the&#13;
estimated high levels of suppressed demand in the city. The forecast growth rates reflect&#13;
expected real increases in GDP growth and, through income and price elasticities reflect&#13;
also the effect of projected income and tariff changes.&#13;
Residential load growth drives the forecast demand. A rapid increase in&#13;
customer numbers is expected to occur in 1996 and 1997, as the system is rehabilitated&#13;
and suppressed demand is taken up. Beyond 1998, the projected increase in customer&#13;
numbers falls. Commercial load growth is expected to be rapid on over the next 7 years&#13;
as suppressed demand is picked up and commercial development accelerates. Growth in&#13;
the government sector is expected to be modest both in terms of customer numbers and&#13;
average consumption.&#13;
The total number of connections is difficult to estimate. The survey of&#13;
electricity wholesalers carried out this year gave a figure of approximately 40,000 but&#13;
since the survey was conducted, it has been discovered, when refurbishing the network,&#13;
that sub-metering has been occurring. If this practice is widespread, the number of&#13;
customers may increase by as much as 50-60%. For the purposes of forecasting, sub-&#13;
connections are included as suppressed demand, and are gradually introduced as sales&#13;
through an increase in the electrification ratio.&#13;
The rate of economic recovery will strongly influence the forecast. Rates of&#13;
GDP growth have been based on the Bank forecasts. For the residential sector, an&#13;
income elasticity of demand of 0.8 has been used. In the commercial and manufacturing&#13;
sectors, a multiplier of one has been used. Technical losses have been estimated at 15%&#13;
of energy generated, and it has been assumed that they will reduce to 7% by the end of&#13;
the forecast period.&#13;
Assumptions have been made about power and load factors, the ratio of&#13;
daytime and evening peak loads and the coincidence of peak loads in the different&#13;
categories to calculate system demands from the energy sales forecasts. The assumptions&#13;
made are considered reasonable but should be confirmed by EDC through a detailed&#13;
study of the demand patterns on their system.&#13;
Forecast results are given in Table 2.1. In summary, demand on EDC's&#13;
generating plant is expected to increase from 55 MW at present, to around 70 MW in&#13;
1998, 100 MW in 2001 and around 160 MW by the year 2009.&#13;

Projected Generation Requirements&#13;
At present, in spite of the best efforts of EDC and various donors, there is a&#13;
peak power deficit in Phnom Penh. Blackouts are a daily feature of the electricity supply.&#13;
New generating plant is being installed at Stations C3 and C5 with the assistance of the&#13;
World Bank and JICA and various donors are assisting with the maintenance of existing&#13;
plant. A new power station, C6, is implemented with the support of the Asian Development&#13;
Bank.&#13;
A medium term investment prioritisation study, funded by UNDP, was&#13;
completed in April 1994. The study identified the need for investment in generation&#13;
exceeding US$50 million during the next three years. Subsequently, the Government&#13;
negotiated and signed an IPP contract with Leader Universal Holdings and other parties for&#13;
purchase of the whole of the output of a 35 MW diesel power plant to be built at Station C2.&#13;
The commissioning of Stations C3 and C5 with new engines and the&#13;
commissioning of the first IPP plant will relieve the peak power deficit from 1996, but only&#13;
until 1998. By that time, a further 35 MW of new generation will be required for Phnom&#13;
Penh. This would relieve the peak power deficit through to 2002 - 2003. At that time, a&#13;
further 40 MW would be required. This assumes that the Kirirom hydropower station will&#13;
be operational again from 1997, contributing 10 MW of capacity. Tentative power balance&#13;
are illustrated in Figure 2.1 and detailed data is given in Table 2.1.&#13;
The likely location of new generation has not been defined at this time, and&#13;
the size of new plant mentioned above is indicative only. Generation plans need to be&#13;
firmed up as soon as possible, and additional transmission connections developed.&#13;
Transmission Requirements&#13;
Power transmission at 115 kV is being introduced to Phnom Penh as part of&#13;
the proposed project. Its introduction is considered necessary to help meet the expected&#13;
increase in demand and to provide the higher reliability. 115 kV has been selected as the&#13;
transmission voltage because it is an appropriate voltage level for the power transfers&#13;
involved. Transmission design capacity will initially be approximately 100 MVA, but&#13;
provision will be made for the addition of further circuits and transformers to expand the&#13;
grid around the city of Phnom Penh as demand grows.&#13;
The transmission system will facilitate the connection of new generation to&#13;
the power system and delivery of power to the market. The transmission system will also&#13;
facilitate the proposed changeover in distribution voltage from 15 kV to 22 kV. Depending&#13;
on the location of future generating plant, it is possible that a higher transmission voltage&#13;
will need to be added to the system in the future. The proposed 115 kV design takes this&#13;
into account. The choice of higher voltage, its capacity and connection arrangements would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -                             Annex 2&#13;
Page 3 of 11&#13;
need to be studied when the needs are known. Any necessary modifications to the 115 kV&#13;
system would need to be arranged at that time.&#13;
Distribution Requirements&#13;
As at 1994, the distribution network is estimated to cover only 30% of&#13;
households in the supply area. With sufficient investment, this is expected to reach about&#13;
80% by the year 2002, staying at this level until the end of the forecast period.&#13;
Investment by EDC in the short term will be used primarily to finance&#13;
rehabilitation of the MV and LV distribution systems. This will include the upgrade of&#13;
existing facilities, and the connection of new customers in all sectors. Rehabilitation will&#13;
reduce losses and improve the quality of supply to customers.&#13;

a/ Based on World Bank Report No. 12667 'Cambodia - From Rehabilitation to Reconstruction'                Real growth in GDP is assumed to tall from the present level of around 8% pa to 4.4% over the forecast period.&#13;
bI Projected increase in average sale is determinerd firstly by long run Income and price elasticities.  The projected growth is then adjusted upwards by 90% of the projected reduction in non-technical losses.  0;&#13;
The peramerters used are GDP and electricity price changes with coefficients of +0.8 and -0.5 respectively.  c/ Assumed to be unaccounted for consumption.                                              In&#13;
The coefficent of 0.8 for GDP changes is considered reasonable for a predominantly reesdential load.  d/ Excludes generating station auxiliaries and own consumptIon.                                    4.&#13;

PHNOM PENH POWER REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Project Design and Implementation Arrangements&#13;
DESIGN OBJECTIVES&#13;
1.    The need to alleviate critical power shortages in Phnom Penh is immediate and urgent. The&#13;
objective of the project design is to provide the transmission and distribution capacity necessary for&#13;
a satisfactory standard of electricity supply in the southern and western greater urban area of Phnom&#13;
Penh, and to meet the expected growth in demand over the period 1995 to 1998, with provision for&#13;
long term expansion after that as the load grows.&#13;
SCOPE OF WORKS&#13;
2.    The scope of work necessary to achieve the project objectives is&#13;
*  Provision for connection of committed generation facilities&#13;
*  Introduction of 115 kV transmission system and grid substations to interconnect existing and&#13;
future generation sources:&#13;
*23 cct-km 115 kVtransmission line&#13;
3 x 115/22/15 kVgrid substations&#13;
- 200 MVA 115 kVtransformers&#13;
*  Development of 22 kV distribution system including distribution transformers:&#13;
* 100 cct-km 22 kVunderground and overhead lines&#13;
40 MVA 22 kVdistribution transformers&#13;
*  Rehabilitation of low voltage distribution system including customer service connections and&#13;
metering facilities:&#13;
* 300 cct-km LV overhead lines&#13;
* 30,000 customer connections&#13;
20 MVAr LVpowerfactor correction capacitors&#13;
*  Provision of engineering, operations and maintenance equipment and facilities&#13;
Construction of stores facilities.&#13;
*  Other ongoing and pending power distribution projects within Phnom Penh being funded by&#13;
various other donors and lending institutions have been taken into account in the development&#13;
of this project, with respect to both areas of implementation and technical developments.&#13;

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS&#13;
Distribution&#13;
3.    Electricity supplies in Phnom Penh emanate from three electrically independent systems.&#13;
These are connected to four old power houses having an installed capacity of 71 MW, but only able&#13;
to supply a maximum demand of 25 MW. The northern system is supplied from C I and C4 power&#13;
stations and the southern system is supplied from C2 and C3 power stations. The system is unable&#13;
to meet the present demand, estimated to be 55 MW, and therefore continuously scheduled load&#13;
shedding is enforced.&#13;
4.    The existing medium voltage (MV) systems, most of which is underground (except for the&#13;
suburban perimeters of the city), comprise 4.4 kV (two wire system), 6.3 kV and 15 kV Most MV&#13;
feeders were laid more than 25 years ago and are now in a poor and unreliable state and in need of&#13;
replacement. The two low voltage (LV) systems(220V two wire and 400/230 V) are also in need of&#13;
replacement. Supply to the majority of customers is presently taken via electrical wholesalers.&#13;
Customer services are of small cross-section and long lengths, resulting in a poor quality supply&#13;
due to the high voltage drop and losses. There is an untenable level of equipment failure, both on&#13;
the MV and LV systems.&#13;
Transmission Planning&#13;
5.    At present EDC does not posses a High Voltage (HV) transmission network although plans&#13;
for such a development have been under consideration for some time. HV Connections will be&#13;
required to provide for the transfer of energy from source to the load distribution centres and to&#13;
interconnect the generating plants in the north, west and south of the city. Under this first stage&#13;
project the three generating stations will be connected at 115 kV to 115/22 kV grid substations.&#13;
There is also an immediate requirement for facilities to transfer power from the proposed 35 MW&#13;
IPP plant. The grid substations are designed to provide for 230 kV connections in the future.&#13;
6.    It is proposed that the 115 kV transmission system provide for a load transfer capability of&#13;
200 MVA per circuit between grid substations in order to provide for future load transfer outside&#13;
Phnom Penh as well as for the City area. Single circuit construction will suffice initially until the&#13;
load growth and security requirements justify the installation of the second 115 kV circuit. It is&#13;
recommended that the circuits be constructed as a double circuit, but only the first circuit be&#13;
installed. When needed, the second circuit could then be insulated and conductored at a relatively&#13;
low cost, without the need to replace poles. The design will consider the use of 22 m concrete&#13;
poles, although suitable wood poles could also be considered.&#13;
MV DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS&#13;
7.    The design features that have been developed for the project take account of current practice&#13;
in Phnom Penh and in neighbouring utilities and to align the designs to international practices. EDC&#13;
has adopted a single Medium Voltage (MV) system (22 kV three phase) over the three different&#13;
existing MV systems (4.4 kV two wire, 6.3 kV three phase, 15 kV three phase).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 3 of 7&#13;
Grid Substations&#13;
8.    Grid substations will provide for 115/22 kV transformation with an ultimate objective to&#13;
provide the system with (n-1) security. The supply of a predicted total load of 180 MVA by 2009&#13;
could ideally be achieved by two 30/50 MVA transformers at each of three grid substations. This&#13;
would be adequate until the end of the forecast period. Beyond this, it is anticipated that additional&#13;
100 MVA grid substations be installed at appropriate locations and connected to a ring transmission&#13;
system. Under this project, it is intended to install two of the three grid substations completely; at&#13;
the third grid substation only the switchyard civil works and 22 kV switchboards will be installed.&#13;
The 115 kV switchgear and transformers may be installed if tender prices prove favourable,&#13;
otherwise they can follow once funding becomes available.&#13;
9.    Each grid substation will comprise an outdoor 115 kV switchyard, with a single busbar with&#13;
two transformer bays and ultimately six incoming bays. Each 115/22 kV transformer will be&#13;
ONAN/ODAF rated at 30/50 MVA. In addition two transformers will be specified with a third (15&#13;
kV) winding, to enable the staged conversion from 15 kV to 22 kV. These transformers would&#13;
initially be used between 15 kV and 22 kV (power flow in either direction), then later used between&#13;
115 kV and 22 kV and/or 15 kV (15 kV being gradually phased out of service). The 15 kV capacity&#13;
of each transformer needs to be sufficient for transferring a load of 20 MVA. The substation layouts&#13;
will also provide for a future 230 kV switchyard. Each indoor, double busbar, 22 kV switchboard&#13;
will include two transformer cubicles, fifteen feeder cubicles and one busbar-coupling breaker. The&#13;
double busbar will facilitate the changeover of the MV system from 15 kV to 22 kV, since one&#13;
busbar could be temporarily operated at each voltage during the changing of each 15 kV feeder (or&#13;
section of feeder) to 22 kV.&#13;
MV System&#13;
10.   The new 22 kV distribution system will continue to be predominately underground within&#13;
the inner city area; using three core aluminium, XLPE cables. Feeders will run between grid&#13;
substations with an interconnectable network. Pilot cables will provide for future remote control&#13;
and indication, similar to that already installed as a pilot scheme under the French project. Single&#13;
circuit overhead construction using 1 Om or 12m concrete poles will be used in the peripheral and&#13;
rural areas. Aluminium conductor will be used with average 40 to 50 metre spans, underbuilt with&#13;
LV where required. To ensure that the changeover from 15 kV to 22 kV can proceed as soon as the&#13;
project procurement arrives on site (and not needing to wait until the grid substation&#13;
commissioning), distribution transformers will be specified with dual 15 kV and 22 kV windings.&#13;
These will be energised initially at 15 kV and then switched to 22 kV once supply becomes&#13;
available.&#13;
&#13;

LV System&#13;
11.   All low voltage distribution will be installed using bundled conductors. The French project&#13;
has already introduced the concept to Phnom Penh and the installed product has been accepted by&#13;
EDC. Service lines will be PVC insulated neutral screen (concentric construction). The concentric&#13;
type construction will help to minimise illegal connections and provide a safe type of overhead&#13;
connection.&#13;
Communications&#13;
12.   Fiber optic cable will be used for comnmunication between the grid substations. The optical&#13;
fibres would be incorporated in the earth wire (OPGW cable) above the 115 kV transmission lines.&#13;
Buried multi-pair telephone cable is proposed to provide comnmunication between the grid&#13;
substations and distribution substations. This would be buried with the 22 kV cable. The cable&#13;
would provide communication for the future SCADA system, as well as providing for voice&#13;
communication for maintenance purposes.&#13;
Stores&#13;
13.   At present EDC operate a stores system, with a main warehouse and two subsidiary stores.&#13;
All are in very poor and run down condition. The present stores systems are cumbersome. There&#13;
are no computer facilities at any of the stores. The existing stores are inadequate and unsuitable for&#13;
the proposed project and it is therefore proposed to construct a new warehouse and introduce a&#13;
modem and computerised stock control system suitable for this and ongoing distribution activities.&#13;
A suitable site needs to be selected and land purchased; this is being addressed at the time of this&#13;
report by EDC.&#13;
PROCUREMENT&#13;
14.   Bid documents are being prepared for procurement of materials for the project by&#13;
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank procurement procedures. The&#13;
specifications cover the design, manufacture, testing, and delivery to Phnom Penh of the required&#13;
materials and plant. Tenderers will be required to quote CIF prices for delivery to the EDC&#13;
warehouse at Phnom Penh, shipped through the river port of Phnom Penh or via the seaport of&#13;
Sihanoukville. The contracts for the substation and transmission line will include the complete&#13;
erection and commissioning (turnkey) of all the supplied equipment. Project materials and plant&#13;
will comprise the following Packages:&#13;

CONSTRUCTION RESOURCES&#13;
19.    There are no experienced contracting or EDC  resources in Phnom  Penh to carry out&#13;
construction of the proposed transmission, distribution and substation works. Other recent&#13;
distribution projects have used EDC staff for construction under close supervision of experienced&#13;
staff from the donor's own country; however this arrangement has not been totally satisfactory.&#13;
Under the present circumstances, unless salaries and wages can be funded externally, there is no&#13;
prospect of EDC staff or workers being available to support a project.&#13;
20.    There  are  two  options available  in  order to  provide  contracting  resource  for the&#13;
implementation of the distribution construction. One option would be for EDC to form a&#13;
subsidiary company to undertake contracting work on major projects, with the authority to&#13;
employ staff at a reasonable rate. The other option is the retention of private sector companies,&#13;
either Cambodian or foreign or both. It is proposed to call registrations of interest from interested&#13;
parties, Cambodian and non-Cambodian by advertising in major local and regional newspapers.&#13;
Depending upon the level of interest, if necessary a pre-registration meeting will be called to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
55 -                                 Annex 5&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
explain EDC's intentions. The responses will determine which option to take. Whichever option is&#13;
chosen, it is recommended that EDC set up a training school for linemen and cablemen and&#13;
introduce an accreditation system. Under this system, only accredited workmen, apart from&#13;
labourers, wili be eligible to work on any EDC distribution construction contracts. Any company&#13;
participating in the tendering process must include the proposed names of the accredited staff to&#13;
be used on the works. It will therefore be important for the training process to be set up at an&#13;
early stage of the project, prior to delivery of materials and start of construction. ADB is&#13;
considering the financing of such a training facility.&#13;
ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS&#13;
21.   TOR for the engineering consultants are given in Annex 12. Site work to be carried out&#13;
by EDC and the consultant (with maximum transfer of technology to EDC), in project design,&#13;

Bank Supervision Plan&#13;
Bank Supervision Inputs to Key Activities&#13;
Bank staff input indicated in the table below is in addition to the regular supervision&#13;
needs for review of progress reports, procurement actions, financial statements, audit reports and&#13;
dealing with associated correspondence. In the first year, 12 staff-weeks will be required to&#13;
review progress with preparation of the construction and complementary commercial&#13;
development program, training of both EDC staff and local contractors, and plans for reform of&#13;
the sector. Thereafter, an average of about 8 staff-weeks per year will be needed to supervise the&#13;
project with visits timed to coincide with agreed project milestones as indicated in the attached&#13;

PHNOM PENH POWER REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Environmental Retrofit and Safety Program&#13;
This annex summarizes the findings and recommendations of an enviromnental&#13;
assessment of the following:&#13;
-    The proposed 115 kV transmission line and associated substations&#13;
-    Clean-up at the existing power stations.&#13;
A. Proposed Transmission Line and Substations&#13;
The initial selection of route and substation locations was undertaken by EDC reflecting&#13;
the need for interconnection of the present and proposed power stations in order to be&#13;
able to deliver a firm power supply to customers, whilst also reflecting the expected&#13;
future expansion of the city limits beyond the location of the line. This route and location&#13;
of substations was subsequently revised on the basis of environmental and social impact&#13;
considerations.&#13;
The assessment of the impact of the proposed transmission line focused on:&#13;
-    cost&#13;
-    maintenance access&#13;
-    environmental and social impacts&#13;
-    minimizing interference with others&#13;
-    compatibility with other power sector developments (especially the proposed 15&#13;
kV JICA-financed line).&#13;
The environmental assessment included also a review of the environmental policy and&#13;
legal framework which is summarized below.&#13;
Policy Legal and Administrative Framework&#13;
Environmental Policy in Cambodia. Essentially Cambodia has no established policy,&#13;
legal or administrative framework for environmental impact assessment and&#13;
environmental protection, other than the general requirements for responsible treatment&#13;
of the environmental set out in the Constitution. Cambodia is currently developing its&#13;
environmental policy. A framework for environmental policy for Cambodia was set out&#13;
in the paper The Status of Kingdom of Cambodia's Environment : Emerging Policies and&#13;
Strategies, presented by the Secretariat of State for the Environment (SSE), to the Fourth&#13;
Pacific Environmental Conference in Honolulu, March 1994. The following summarizes&#13;
the proposed framework:&#13;
On the 2nd of July 1993 the government of Cambodia created a Ministry of&#13;
Environment. This was the first major step towards the recognition of the&#13;
importance of environmental management for the future of Cambodia. This&#13;
Ministry was transformed to a Secretariat of State for Environment, in November&#13;
1993. The responsibilities of the SSE include nature conservation, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 2 of 6&#13;
determination of environmental policy, environmental planning, water and land use&#13;
management, the drafting of environmental legislation, environmental impact&#13;
assessments, environmental education and information, and environmental research&#13;
and data collection. SSE has stated that its near-term planning objectives are:&#13;
*    passage of overall environmental legislation which defines authority and&#13;
responsibilities&#13;
*    preparation and passage of an EIA law&#13;
*    cooperation in land-use planning and zoning&#13;
*    preparation of management plans for parks and other protected areas&#13;
*    drafting of regulations, guidelines, and standards for environmental&#13;
management and pollution control&#13;
*    promotion of environmental education and awareness&#13;
*    support of data acquisition and integrated information management".&#13;
In addition to SSE activities, the Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy (MIME) and&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture, Forests, and Fisheries (MAFF) are taking actions to foster&#13;
sustainable development. MIME is pursuing passage of a Minerals Law developed during&#13;
1994. The Minerals Law calls for preparation of Environment Protection Plans to&#13;
mitigate adverse impacts from mineral extraction/processing activities. MAFF is&#13;
preparing a Forestry Code to control commercial logging activities and intends to become&#13;
a partner in the Tropical Forest Action Planning process which is expected to lead to a&#13;
National Development Policy for forestry resources.&#13;
As yet there are no mechanisms in Cambodia for the screening of development projects&#13;
through EIAs. EDC has no formal environmental policy but has recognized the need for&#13;
responsible treatment of the environmental as it rehabilitates and expands its electrical&#13;
network.&#13;
Environmental Assessment&#13;
a.   Transmission Line&#13;
The transmission line will be approximately 23 km in length. The line design and route&#13;
have been particularly chosen to take full advantage of an existing public road ROW,&#13;
avoid the radio station for technical reasons and minimize the environmental visual and&#13;
property affecting the impact. However compensation will be considered and where&#13;
justified, paid property owners affected by the line route. The line will be similar in&#13;
appearance to lower voltage lines except that the poles will be taller (approximately 20&#13;
meters, compared to the 9 meter poles for LV lines and 11 meter poles used for MV&#13;
lines). The poles may also carry MV and LV lines for local supply.&#13;
b.   Grid Substations&#13;
The grid substation locations have been selected. The site of GS3 is presently proposed&#13;
on private land and steps are being taken in conjunction with the Municipality to identify&#13;
and compensate the owners on an equitable basis.&#13;
c.   Environmental Impact&#13;
There are two environmental impacts of note, namely visual and social, although both are&#13;
considered minor:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-66 -                              Annex I I&#13;
Page 3 of 6&#13;
Visual Impac. Overall the line will have a moderate negative visual impact over much of&#13;
the route. Along the southern part of the route visual impact will be low, due to the&#13;
presence of existing trees and power lines. Elsewhere there will be moderate visual&#13;
impacts as the line will run along roadways or through paddy fields where there are no&#13;
existing power lines. The countryside in these areas is relatively open and flat with&#13;
scattered trees ranging up to the height of the proposed lines. These trees will restrict the&#13;
distance from which the line can be viewed from the city.&#13;
Social Impact. The line will have a moderate positive social impact. It will also have&#13;
some local effects on growth and development patterns in the western area of the city.&#13;
There will be positive social and economic impacts due to employment of local labor&#13;
during construction. Skills learned from local construction of concrete poles will be&#13;
transferable to other forms of pre-cast construction. The increased reliability of power&#13;
supply will also bring positive social and economic benefits, as well as decreased&#13;
dependence on noisy and inefficient private generators.&#13;
Ecological Impacts. No significant ecological impacts are expected.&#13;
Construction. Construction impacts will be minor, provided that the line is built in the dry&#13;
season. Construction in the wet season is not recommended due to access difficulty and&#13;
crop damage.&#13;
Qverall Imp=. The overall environrental impact of the transmission line will be&#13;
positive. The negative impacts will be minimal. The line will bring substantial&#13;
environmental benefits through improving the overall reliability of power supply to&#13;
consumers, thus reducing reliance on small privately owned and inefficient generators.&#13;
d.   Route Selection&#13;
The proposed transmission line is routed along roads where feasible, with cross-country&#13;
diversions only to avoid specific difficulties. Routing the transmission line directly on a&#13;
cross-country route was evaluated. Its primary advantages are:&#13;
-    reduction in construction cost due to a shorter more direct transmission line length&#13;
-    fewer persons subjected in the short to medium term to electric fields due to&#13;
relative absence of housing outside the city limits.&#13;
The primary disadvantages of direct cross-country routes are:&#13;
-    more difficult access for repairs and maintenance&#13;
-    greater visual impact&#13;
-    greater construction impacts due to need to construct access roads&#13;
-    need to negotiate rights of way with attendant compensation costs&#13;
-    greater long term impacts as the city expands beyond its present limits, resulting in&#13;
the line running through built up areas.&#13;
On balance, the roadside route was considered to be the most desirable option, except&#13;
where local factors favor a cross-country diversion as having the lowest overall long term&#13;
impact.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Page 4 of 6&#13;
e.   Mitigation Plan&#13;
The following design measures are proposed to mitigate the environmental impacts of the&#13;
proposed transmission line:&#13;
Yisual Impacts Visual impacts have been lessened by routing the transmission line&#13;
alongside existing roadways where feasible. Along roadways a high degree of&#13;
modification of the environment already exists, and the visual absorption capacity (VAC)&#13;
is greatest due to existing power lines and trees. A single concrete pole design has been&#13;
chosen instead of a steel tower, partly on aesthetic grounds. The poles have the capability&#13;
to support other lines, thus reducing visual congestion from multiple lines (high voltage,&#13;
medium voltage, and low voltage).&#13;
Impact on Trees. Impact on trees has been reduced by routing the transmission line&#13;
around the avenue of trees to the south of the radio installation. This route avoids the&#13;
need to trim or remove the trees which are an important visual component of the road and&#13;
which provide an area of shade in which roadside stalls have been established.&#13;
Impact on Radio/TV . Potential impacts on radio and television transmissions have been&#13;
reduced by routing the transmission line away from transmission masts.&#13;
Electric Fields. Concerns about impacts from electric fields have been addressed by&#13;
routing the transmission line away from houses, schools and the like as far as is&#13;
practicable.&#13;
There is no requirement for environmental monitoring in relation to the transmission line&#13;
and substations.&#13;
B. Environmental Audit of Power Stations&#13;
Environmental considerations of the present power stations focused on those impacts that&#13;
would be appropriate and cost-effective to treat during the period of implementation of&#13;
the project, bearing in mind the expected short remaining life of some of them.&#13;
Scope and Methodology&#13;
An environmental evaluation of the power stations presently in operation was undertaken&#13;
including inspection and audit of each plant, identification of retrofit works, and&#13;
evaluation of bill of quantities and costs estimates. Audits were confined to visual&#13;
inspections and interviews of staff. The descriptions of physical works, and estimated bill&#13;
of quantities and cost estimates are preliminary and subject to confirmation during the&#13;
detailed design phase to be undertaken by the EDC with the project consultant support.&#13;
Environmental Standards&#13;
In the absence of appropriate national criteria, it is possible to use any one of the&#13;
following standards for determining acceptable environmental discharges: (i) numerical&#13;
standards based on the assimilation capacity of the particular environment; (ii) numerical&#13;
standards adopted elsewhere; or (iii) good practice standards which identify suitable&#13;
treatment technologies based on accepted international practice.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -                                 Annex l l&#13;
Page 5 of 6&#13;
Adopting best practice standards puts the emphasis on installing appropriate facilities,&#13;
maintaining them, and operating them  correctly.   This was considered the most&#13;
appropriate approach in the circumstances, given the low level of knowledge about the&#13;
assimilation capacity of the receiving environment.&#13;
The adoption of this approach requires judgment as to what constitutes good international&#13;
practice. It is proposed that the standards adopted are those considered good practice in&#13;
neighboring countries, such as Thailand.&#13;
PCBs&#13;
The presence of PCBs in service on the network was addressed, although this possibility&#13;
was considered remote because (i) PCB did not come into general use until after the time&#13;
when the network started to fall into disrepair; (ii) PCB was generally used in capacitors&#13;
for which there is little need on EDC's underground cable system; and (iii) PCB was not&#13;
generally used in distribution transformers, except in special circumstances that do not&#13;
apply in EDC's case. Nevertheless, EDC carried out a random inspection program to&#13;
check for their presence on the network concluding that there is no PCB in service in&#13;
Phnom Penh's distribution network.&#13;

PHNOM PENH POWER REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Summary of Land Acquisition and Compensation Plan&#13;
The Magnitude of Adverse Project Impact&#13;
1.    Project components that involve resettlement issues are: (i) the 23 km long right-&#13;
of-way for the 1 15 kV (high voltage) transmission line (T/L); and (ii) two 1 15/22 kV grid&#13;
substation (GS 2 and GS 3). The substation site for GS 3 will involve acquisition of about&#13;
8,000 square meters of privately owned land, and will affect nine households. The&#13;
substation site for GS 2 is located on unoccupied, presently submerged, government land.&#13;
Access road for this site requires the acquisition of 1,350 square meter, affecting four&#13;
households. The third grid substations (GS 1) do not require land, as EDC already owns&#13;
the plot.&#13;
2.    Since the T/L consists of single poles, and because of flexibility in positioning of&#13;
the poles, it is possible to minimize disturbance of land use. The right-of-way restrictions&#13;
imposed for safety reasons has been determined to be three meters on each side of the&#13;
line, i.e. a six meter wide corridor, where no structures, crops, etc. are allowed above&#13;
three meters. No access outside the poles are required for maintenance or repair work.&#13;
3.    As both the design and the routing of the T/L has consciously sought to avoid&#13;
adverse social impact, the magnitude of adverse social impact is much less than could be&#13;
expected in a urban environment.&#13;
4.    Table 11.1 gives an overview of the types of impact and the number of project&#13;
affected people in the project.&#13;

5.     From the above it can be seen that, by following the existing right-of-way for half&#13;
of the 23 km and the right-of-way for the proposed road, for the remaining, it has been&#13;
possible to reduce adverse impact on people to a minimum. A total of 149 persons in 32&#13;
families will be affected. Only six households will have to move their residential houses&#13;
from the right-of-way of the 23 km transmission line. The impact is hardest on the 9&#13;
families affected by the grid substations, who will have to move away. The 6 families&#13;
affected by relocation in the right-of-way of the T/L only have to move their structures&#13;
out of the right of way zone, but can remain in the neighborhood. Most of the petty&#13;
businesses can remain in the vicinity.&#13;
Policy&#13;
6.     Legislation regarding ownership and usage of land has undergone major changes,&#13;
and had three laws during the last ten years. The Land Law of 1987 which reintroduced&#13;
the concept of private ownership also indicate that the state has the right to take back&#13;
privately held land for public projects. There is no clear procedure for expropriation and&#13;
for calculation of compensation for land, structures and crops. The law was modified and&#13;
reissued in 1992, and is currently under revision by the parliament.&#13;
7.     The 1992 Land Law states in Article 3, that in the case where the public is&#13;
required to take possession of land from a land user who has government permission to&#13;
own or use the land "must be given full compensation."&#13;
8.     The following policy has been adopted by EDC, and will apply to people affected&#13;
by transmission poles and lines (T/L) and grid substations (GS):&#13;
(a)  Project design. The transmission project and its components will be designed in a&#13;
manner which will minimize displacement and adverse impacts on lives and&#13;
incomes of affected people.&#13;
(b)  Compensation. All people affected by land acquisition and/or right-of-way for&#13;
transmission lines shall be provided fair compensation for lost assets - land,&#13;
houses/structures, crops and investments - based on replacement value.&#13;
(i)    The principles for compensation for land will be as follows:&#13;
a.  For land that is required for the project, compensation shall be paid at&#13;
replacement value. This includes land required for grid substations.&#13;
b.  To compensate for the restrictions introduced on the land use by a&#13;
new right-of-way, EDC will pay the owner an "easement fee" no less&#13;
than 2 percent of the replacement value of the land, or the free&#13;
installation of an electricity connection (consumption to be paid by&#13;
the consumer). The owner can continue to use the land for existing&#13;
purposes not interfering with the lines (i.e. crops, trees and structures&#13;
must be less than 3 meters in height). Land compensation for the&#13;
right-of-way for transmission lines will only be given, when EDC&#13;
will acquire the land and this will only happen in densely urban areas,&#13;
and is not relevant to this project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 3 of 8&#13;
c.  In case of transmission poles, the compensation will be in the form of&#13;
a pole fee of Riel 10,000/square meter. This transaction will nornally&#13;
not involve formal 'acquisition' of the land.&#13;
(ii)    Affected houses and/or structures will be compensated at their&#13;
replacement value and EDC will also provide transfer costs. This will be&#13;
referred to as the Dismantling, Transfer and Reconstruction (DTR)&#13;
allowance.&#13;
(iii)   Trees and crops will be compensated at market value.&#13;
(iv)   Negotiation and grievance procedures. An agreement will be sought with&#13;
each affected household on the compensation derived from the above&#13;
principles. EDC will establish an independent Appraisal and Grievance&#13;
Committee for dealing with cases where an agreement with the affected&#13;
household can not be reached. Further negotiations will be based on the&#13;
committee's recommendations.&#13;
(v)    Resettlement Incentive Allowance. Affected people shall be paid&#13;
Resettlement Incentive Allowance (RIA) to cover initial income losses&#13;
during the transition period and to encourage people to relocate. This&#13;
allowance will be equivalent to about three months of income.&#13;
(Iv)   Replacement land/Resettlement for Displaced Households. Measures shall&#13;
be taken to help restore the standard of living of households that are&#13;
displaced as a result of land acquisition. These displaced households will&#13;
be offered equivalent replacement land in the vicinity. This land will be&#13;
identified jointly by the affected household and EDC, and will be financed&#13;
by EDC. The households who do not accept replacement land will instead&#13;
receive cash compensation for their land.&#13;
(vii)  Participation and Consultation. The process of determining compensation&#13;
and the process of relocation shall be transparent and participatory. The&#13;
affected people shall be included in planning and implementation of the&#13;
Land Acquisition and Compensation Plan, and provided with adequate&#13;
information regarding compensation entitlements, available options, and&#13;
procedures for grievance and appeals.&#13;
(viii)  The Land Acquisition and Compensation Plan will have a clear&#13;
implementation time frame and people will be compensated and will be&#13;
given sufficient lead time to move prior to commencement of construction&#13;
works.&#13;
(Ix)   EDC will provide all costs required for satisfactory implementation,&#13;
management and monitoring of the Land Acquisition and Compensation&#13;
Plan.&#13;

Institutional Aspects&#13;
9.    EDC has prepared a Land Acquisition and Compensation Plan for the project.&#13;
This is one of the first attempts to deal systematically, and on a fair basis, with the&#13;
practical problems of land acquisition in post-war Cambodia. The plan was prepared&#13;
under the following conditions:&#13;
in an uncertain legal environment. Thus, most of the land in Cambodia either does&#13;
not have clear registration or is not registered at all. For example, the land&#13;
registration office estimates that only 17,000 properties in Phnom Penh are&#13;
registered whereas at least another 65,000 property registrations are pending. The&#13;
Land Law is under revision. Ownership disputes over land are not uncommon.&#13;
There is no established procedures for calculating compensation for fixed assets.&#13;
as a new task for EDC and the local govermment, which has no policy on land&#13;
acquisition and little experience or training in dealing with land acquisition and&#13;
compensation issues whichi has to conform to the World Bank's Operational&#13;
Directive 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement.&#13;
10.   In order to facilitate the implementation of the Land Acquisition and&#13;
Compensation Plan, this will be complemented by the preparation of a Due Process&#13;
Manual which will specify guidelines for implementation. This effort will be undertaken&#13;
with the support of a consultant to be funded by the Project Technical Assistance&#13;
component (Annex 12)&#13;
11.   EDC has sought the assistance from the Municipality and the government to&#13;
establish a procedure for a fair level of compensation to private owners of land for this&#13;
plan, A rapid survey of land market prices in the area of GS 2 and GS 3 has been initiated&#13;
by Department of the Cadastre in the Municipality at the request of EDC. The&#13;
Department of Cadastre has expressed interest to use this opportunity as a first step to&#13;
establish fair and realistic land valuation procedures in Phnom Penh. The procedures&#13;
adopted in this plan may thus provide valuable experience in developing adequate&#13;
procedures for asset valuation, negotiations, arbitration and grievances. Although EDC is&#13;
committed to the principle of fair negotiations, an element of realism and fairness to the&#13;
remaining public in the area must also be considered.&#13;
12.   EDC is responsible for the implementation of this land acquisition and&#13;
compensation plan. The Project Management Unit (PMU) will handle issues requiring&#13;
actions and coordination with the Municipality, and other local authorities, of Phnom&#13;
Penh. The Project Implementation Unit has overall control and management of the budget&#13;
for Land acquisition and compensation. For the organization of EDC and Ministry of&#13;
Industry, Mines and Energy.&#13;
13.   The Municipality of Phnom Penh is divided into seven districts (Khan or Srok),&#13;
within each district are a number (up to nine) quarters (Sangkat), within which are a&#13;
number of villages (Phoum). The smallest unit is the group (Krom) consisting of 20-30&#13;
households, where a semi-official is responsible for reporting accidents and liaison with&#13;
the local authorities.&#13;

14.   Within their areas of responsibility the local authorities will carry out work related&#13;
to land acquisition and compensation, under the supervision of the Project&#13;
Implementation Unit in EDC.&#13;
15.   The following overview over the specific activities to be carried out as part of this&#13;
plan indicate the responsible agency and the specific person (position), who will carry out&#13;

Implementation&#13;
16.   During the physical mapping and the social assessment of losses likely to be&#13;
borne by people because of the project, each and every household along the proposed&#13;
route was visited, and information about the project given.&#13;
17.   EDC, the Planning and Design Department, will organize that a second round of&#13;
systematic information campaign (public meetings) be conducted along the ROW, with&#13;
special attention to those affected by the ROW, once the details of the route (e.g. placing&#13;
of poles) is known. At the same time an official announcement in local newspapers will&#13;
be issued, stating that any person having objections or comments to the assessment of&#13;
individual losses and their valuation, must submit those in writing before 30 days after&#13;
the publication.&#13;
18.   Where land is to be acquired for grid substations or where T/L crosses private&#13;
land, a process of negotiation has started during the survey, and will continue between the&#13;
owner and EDC until agreement on the level of compensation is reached. During this&#13;
process, expected to take two to three more meetings, information about the project will&#13;
also be given. Formal notification will be given by EDC, Planning and design&#13;
Department, at least two month prior to start of construction.&#13;
19.   No person or family will be asked to relocate unless the above steps have been&#13;
completed, an agreement on the compensation has been reached, and compensation&#13;
and/or allowances has been paid in cash or delivered in kind. The compensation&#13;
procedure must be finalized at least two month prior to relocation, and start of&#13;
construction. Construction of the trasmission line and substations is expected to start in&#13;
mid June and early July 1996, respectively.&#13;
20.   EDC will make an effort to reach an agreement with each affected household on&#13;
the compensation derived from the policy principles mentioned in paragraph 8, above. In&#13;
the event that EDC is unable to reach an agreement on asset valuation and compensation&#13;
with the affected household, EDC will establish an independent Appraisal and Grievance&#13;
Committee, which will include representatives of the legal authority of the Municipality,&#13;
an independent, reputed NGO, involved in urban development, and a village elder (Me&#13;
Phoum) from the area of dispute/complaint. EDC will not be part of this committee.&#13;
Further negotiations will be based on the committees recommendations. This committee&#13;
will also be called upon to deal with complaints arising up to three month after the&#13;
construction of the T/L and grid Substations.&#13;
21.   The PMU in EDC, which will be recipient of the Technical Assistance&#13;
Component of the project (Annex 12), will be responsible for carrying out all activities&#13;
related to this plan, unless otherwise mentioned. Supervision and internal monitoring will&#13;
be the responsibility of the Deputy Director heading the Unit assisted by the project&#13;
consultant, who will report progress and problems to the Director and the Board of&#13;
Directors, and if needed recommend on remedial actions.&#13;
&#13;

Page 7 of 8&#13;
22.   To facilitate this work, and because of the pilot nature of the land acquisition and&#13;
compensation procedures, a social science research organization (NGO) will be engaged&#13;
to do external monitoring and evaluation, i.e. carry out two rapid monitoring studies (up&#13;
to one week each): one, as a baseline, during November 1995, and one, one month prior&#13;
to start of construction (May 1996), to assess if all project affected people have been dealt&#13;
with fairly, and acceptable to them. Six month after finishing of construction, the same&#13;
organization will make an evaluation study to determine if project affected people have&#13;
maintained or improved their living standard. Each monitoring study will be submitted to&#13;
EDC no later than two weeks after field work and a final evaluation report will be&#13;
produced by end of 1997, which will also incorporate findings on the procedure adopted&#13;
by EDC for the implementation of this plan, and recommendations on procedural&#13;
improvements.&#13;

Compensation Plan is presented in Figure 11.1&#13;

25.   The basis for this budget are estimates. On the major cost for compensation, no&#13;
firm costing can be made yet, since the negotiations with the owners of the land and&#13;
houses have just started. The estimate for this has been set relatively high, at US$20 per&#13;
square meter. In addition, total cost estimates for the project consider a physical&#13;
contigency of 10% above the base cost.&#13;
26.  All compensation and allowances/fees are costs to be borne locally. Only the&#13;
services and contracts can be financed out of the IDA credit. It is therefore of vital&#13;
importance that local funds are made available for this activity, as it is a precondition for&#13;
start of implementing the physical part of the project.&#13;

PHNOM PENH POWER REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Technical Assistance Component&#13;
The technical assistance component of this project aims at improving the sector&#13;
operations and performance by transferring technical know-how, building institutional&#13;
capacity and supporting sector reforms. It has been designed to (a) address the most&#13;
pressing needs of EDC in the domain of project implementation, utility management and&#13;
commercial operations, and (b) assist MIME in initiating the reform process conducive&#13;
to an autonomous, financially viable power sector open to the private sector. The&#13;
proposed assistance will strengthen EDC's technical, managerial, commercial and&#13;
financial capabilities.&#13;
The technical assistance component has been designed to sustain and complement&#13;
the ongoing UNDP/World Bank and ADB's training and management support programs&#13;
for EDC and MIME. The project will assist EDC with:&#13;
(a)   technical, engineering and training support. Engineering assistance will be&#13;
provided in conjunction with the implementation of the project to support the&#13;
Project Management Unit (PMU) in procurement, supervision and engineering&#13;
activities, and training of EDC personnel on project management (terms of&#13;
reference attached);&#13;
(b)   commercial operations support. Consultancy services will be provided to&#13;
implement the computerization of accounting, billing and collection services and&#13;
develop the necessary customer management system; the project will also&#13;
continue the specialized technical support in engineering and commercial areas&#13;
initiated under the UNDP/World Bank technical assistance project thorugh the&#13;
provision of United Nations Volunteers (UNV).&#13;
(c)   compensation plan and environmental unit. Consultancy services will be provided&#13;
to help EDC implementing the project compensation plan for land acquisition and&#13;
to assess and define the scope for establishing an environmental unit within EDC.&#13;
The provision of an advisor to EDC's Board of Director, although not funded by the&#13;
Credit, is considered an essential part of the power sector reform process. Terms of&#13;
reference for that position are also attached.&#13;
The component to MIME will include:&#13;
(a)   regulatory framework and commercialization study (phase II!. consultancy&#13;

I.   Project Scope&#13;
General Information&#13;
The Phnom Penh Distribution Rehabilitation Project involves the greater urban area of&#13;
Phnom Penh in Cambodia. Distribution in Phnom Penh comprises three electrically&#13;
independent systems operated and supplied from four old power stations having an&#13;
installed capacity of 73 MW, but only able to supply a maximum demand of 27 MW. The&#13;
northern system is supplied from Cl and C4 power stations and the southern system is&#13;
supplied from C2 and C3 power stations. The system is unable to meet the present&#13;
demand, estimated to be 55 MW, and therefore continuously scheduled load shedding is&#13;
enforced.&#13;
The existing medium voltage (MV) systems are all underground except for the suburban&#13;
perimeters of the city. Underground 15 kV cables were laid more than 25 years ago and&#13;
for various reasons are now in a poor and unreliable state. The 6.3 kV system is also old&#13;
and in need of replacement. The 4.4 kV system caters for the north-east part of the city,&#13;
which has the highest demand density. It has been in operation since the 1930's and is&#13;
overdue for replacement.&#13;
Project Objective&#13;
The objective of the project is to support the power sector rehabilitation, expansion,&#13;
restructuring, and institutional development processes which EDC and the Government of&#13;
Cambodia (GOC) have initiated. EDC has prepared a four-year transmission and&#13;
distribution system rehabilitation, expansion, energy efficiency (loss reduction)&#13;
improvement and institutional development for the Project Implementation Plan (PIP). It&#13;
gives the objectives to be reached, the actions needed to reach the objectives,&#13;
responsibilities for these actions and their timing.&#13;
Project Description&#13;
The items to be fully financed by IDA are high priority items for the Transmission and&#13;
Distribution (T&amp;D) system rehabilitation of the backbone or core network and equipment&#13;
of the Phnom Penh area, necessary to improve EDC's institutional performance and to&#13;

(MIME). The Government is willing to undertake a reform of the power sector aimed at&#13;
achieving a more efficient operation and development, open to private sector&#13;
participation. As a first step, the Government committed to establishing EDC as an&#13;
autonomous corporation by 1995. MIME, with the support of the World Bank, is in the&#13;
process of drafting the legal documents establishing EDC as an autonomous company&#13;
and providing the general principles under which the power sector will operate.&#13;
Accordingly, EDC will be established as a state-owned corporation with limited liability,&#13;
responsible for generation, transmission and distribution of electric power through the&#13;
country. The company will operate as a commercial business, and will have a Board of&#13;
Directors composed by representatives of the Government and the business community.&#13;

PHNOM PENH POWER REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Monitoring Land Acquisition and Compensation and Establishing Environmental&#13;
Management Capabilities&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
I.    Background&#13;
Electricity generation in Cambodia is in small isolated systems. The largest&#13;
system (85% of national consumption) is in Phnom Penh. Only 32MW of a total of&#13;
71MW installed capacity are available in the city. Phnom Penh demand is estimated at&#13;
85MW, and assuming a moderate economic growth, electricity consumption is expected&#13;
to reach 100MW during 1996 and 150 MW by the year 2000. The need to alleviate&#13;
critical power shortages in Phnom Penh is immediate and urgent. The objective of the&#13;
Phnom Penh Power Rehabilitation Project is to provide the transmission and distribution&#13;
capacity necessary to a satisfactory standard of electricity supply in the southern and&#13;
western greater urban area of Phnom Penh and to meet the expected growth in demand&#13;
over the period 1995-1998.&#13;
Two components of the project involve land acquisition, and compensation and&#13;
may originate resettlement issues during implementation: (i) a 23 km long right-of-way&#13;
for the 115 kV (high voltage) transmission line; and (ii) two 115/22 kV grid substation&#13;
(GS2 and GS3). The substation site for GS3 will involve the acquisition of about 8,000&#13;
square meters of privately owned land, and will affect nine households. The substation&#13;
site for GS2 is located on unoccupied, presently submerged, government land. Access&#13;
road for this site requires the acquisition of 1,350 square meters, affecting four&#13;
households. Although the scale of land acquisition is small, the compensation issue&#13;
proves difficult to be addressed because of the lack or weaknesses of land&#13;
acquisition/expropriation legislation and registration system, and the very little&#13;
experience or training of both local government and EDC on these matters.&#13;
On a more general level, Cambodia lacks a set of environmental policies and the&#13;
capacity to manage environmental issues. The process of developing environmental&#13;
legislation and creating institutions is still at an early stage. The lack of environmental&#13;
institutions within EDC and the Ministry of Mines and Energy, legislation and manpower&#13;
reflects directly on the utility's operations, which are currently planned on the basis of&#13;
The Project Implementation Unit, which will be established as part of the technical assistance component&#13;
of the project, will be responsible for carrying out all activities related to the land acquisition and&#13;
compensation plan.&#13;

techno-economic considerations, without or with minor considerations for impacts on&#13;
resettlements and degradation of natural resources.&#13;
II.   Objective&#13;
The objective of the proposed technical assistance (TA) is twofold: (i) assist and&#13;
support the land acquisition and compensation procedures related to project&#13;
implementation; and (ii) assist EDC in establishing environmental management&#13;
capabilities and corporate environmental policies.&#13;
The first objective will be achieved by assisting EDC in the preparation of a Due&#13;
Process Manual for Land Acquisition, Compensation and rehabilitation, assessing the&#13;
need for remedial actions and drawing lessons for future EDC's land acquisition&#13;
operations. The second objective will be achieved by preparing a plan for setting up and&#13;
developing an environrmental unit within EDC.&#13;
III.   Scope of Work&#13;
Land Acquisition and Compensation&#13;
The consultants will carry out:&#13;
(i)   assist in the preparation of a Due Process Manual, specifying guidelines for the&#13;
implementation of the compensation plan. The manual must clarify, inter alia, the&#13;
definition of such concepts as 'affected' and 'displaced' person, define all types of&#13;
losses/impacts covered by the policy, the corresponding entitlements and entitled&#13;
persons, and the mechanism for the land-for-land option. The manual must also&#13;
prescribe the procedures of registration, verification, quantification and valuation&#13;
of such losses/impacts, and how to determine/negotiate and deliver the&#13;
entitlements;&#13;
(ii)   assess the need for staff, organizational responsibility, training and equipment for&#13;
ensuring institutional capacity in EDC for dealing with land acquisition and&#13;
compensation issues; and&#13;
(iii) prepare a plan for institutional capacity regarding land acquisition, compensation&#13;
and rehabilitation, based on the above assessment.&#13;
The monitoring and evaluation of the land acquisition and compensation should&#13;
be carried out by local consultants as prescribed in the plan, and be reported to the TA&#13;
consultant, who will report to IDA.&#13;

EDC's Environmental Unit Development Plan&#13;
The consultant would be responsible for preparing a development plan of the&#13;
environmental unit to be established within EDC, for the first three years of operations.&#13;
The plan will include, but not limit to, the following:&#13;
(i)   identify a set of priority objectives and activities for EDC  management, with&#13;
specific performance criteria for each activity;&#13;
(ii)   prepare a staffing plan for hiring skilled environmental staff;&#13;
(iii)  design a training program for all levels of the environmental unit covering&#13;
environmental management. natural resources, pollution control, monitoring R&amp;R&#13;
and community development data collection and processing, EIA preparation,&#13;
safety and environmental audit and legal aspects and government regulations;&#13;
(iv)   prepare a financial plan setting out the costs of routine environmental&#13;
management activities, purchase, installation and operation of pollution control&#13;
technology, costing of training activities.&#13;
Prior to preparing the development plan, the consultant would survey the&#13;
regulatory framework for pollution control in the energy sector in Cambodia, and would&#13;
identify key existing regulations and possible gaps therein. Such survey, together with the&#13;
technical assessment of key issues, would be the basis for identifying the priority&#13;
objectives and activities of the environmental unit.&#13;
The assignment will require about 10 staff-weeks. The exact amount of work in&#13;
the field should be agreed with the World Bank and approved by EDC. The consultant&#13;
will prepare a report summarizing findings and recommendations along the above lines.&#13;
The report will be submitted to EDC and the World Bank for review along with all the&#13;
data collected and analyses carried out.&#13;
The consultants expertise should include: sociology resettlement and&#13;
rehabilitation, corporate environmental management, computerized data management,&#13;
office management, and training.&#13;

PHNOM PENH POWER REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Power Sector Regulatory Framework&#13;
and Commercialization Study&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
I.    Background&#13;
Cambodia's power sector is in a situation of crisis characterized by severe power&#13;
shortages, high energy losses, poor cash collections, weak management and an&#13;
unmotivated labor force. Electricity supply is responsibility of Electricite du Cambodge&#13;
(EDC), a nationwide utility reporting to, and under strict control of, the Ministry of&#13;
Industry Mines and Energy (MIME). EDC's financial situation constitutes a serious&#13;
constraint for an efficient operation of the power system and a burden to public finances.&#13;
Electricity tariffs are relatively high but with high production costs, high technical and&#13;
non technical losses, and a poor collection record, EDC runs a large cash deficit which is&#13;
covered by Ministry of Finance contributions. The current organization of the energy&#13;
sector provides for a dual role for the state (MIME) as both policy maker and regulator,&#13;
and operator. This implies a conflict of functions that prevents an efficient operation of&#13;
power utilities on a commercial basis. MIME is aware of this situation and is willing to&#13;
undertake a reform being committed to establish EDC as an autonomous corporation by&#13;
1995. The Government is also interested in promoting private sector participation as a&#13;
way of mobilizing additional financial resources and inducing efficiency. MIME, with the&#13;
support of the World Bank, has started the process of drafting the legal documents which&#13;
will establish EDC as an autonomous company, and will provide the general principles&#13;
under which the power sector will operate. To create the enabling environment for an&#13;
efficient development and operation of the power sector, and to attract private sector&#13;
participation, it will be necessary to set up a suitable legal and regulatory framework to&#13;
define clearly the role of MIME, its relationship with EDC and EDC's functions and&#13;
responsibilities, as well as to introduce efficiency incentives, while protecting the&#13;
interests of investors and consumers. This requires an examination, and subsequent&#13;
reform, of the sector structure and EDC's organization.&#13;
II.   Objective&#13;
The main objective of the study is to help the Government of Cambodia increase&#13;
sector efficiency by defining and implementing a suitable structure for the power sector,&#13;
and promoting participation of the private sector. The study is aimed at helping the sector&#13;
to become financially autonomous, thus reducing previous burden imposed on&#13;
Government's finances, develop decentralized and eventually privately owned utilities,&#13;
and support a competitive self-sustained process of economic growth. To this end the&#13;
&#13;

Page 14 of 17&#13;
study will support the Government in defining options for sector structure and regulatory&#13;
framework, and the formulation of an action plan for establishing EDC as an autonomous&#13;
corporation. This will require:&#13;
-     evaluation of options for restructuring the power sector taking into account&#13;
relevant experience in countries that have undergone reforms in the power sector;&#13;
-     designing an organization for EDC consistent with the proposed sector structure;&#13;
-     formulating an action plan for the commercialization of EDC;&#13;
-     establishing a regulatory framework aimed at providing incentives for an efficient&#13;
and reliable supply of electricity at least cost, attract foreign capital, and promote&#13;
efficient operation.&#13;
III.   Scope of Work&#13;
The study will be undertaken in two phases. Phase I would (i) review the existing&#13;
power sector organization, legal and regulatory arrangements; (ii) identify Government&#13;
objectives for the sector; (iii) assess options for restructuring the sector to achieve&#13;
government objectives; and (iv) develop a strategy and implementation plan for the&#13;
proposed structure and ommercialization of EDC. Phase II would comprise the&#13;
preparation of a new regulatory frarnework and a plan for its implementation.&#13;
Phase I - Proposed Organizational Structure and Commercialization Plan&#13;
For Phase I of the study the consultants will be expected to perform the following&#13;
tasks:&#13;
(i)    discuss Government's power sector objectives;&#13;
(ii)   review  current status of the power sector based on available studies and&#13;
information from other sources, including the following aspects:&#13;
-     laws and institutional arrangements for regulation and operation of the&#13;
sector;&#13;
-     current organization of power entities, including their legal status and&#13;
organization;&#13;
-     staffing and management of existing power entities;&#13;
-     existing current commercial and accounting practices;&#13;
relative roles of other producers or distributors in Cambodia, such as&#13;
captive power, "wholesalers", village electric organizations;&#13;
&#13;

(iii) based on the experience of other countries, assess alternative organizational&#13;
structures for the Cambodian power sector. The following aspects should be&#13;
considered:&#13;
-     ownership options for generation, transmission and distribution;&#13;
-     role of independent power producers;&#13;
-     extent of vertical or horizontal integration needed to achieve the&#13;
Government's objectives;&#13;
-     evaluation of pros and cons of different structural arrangements, and&#13;
propose most suitable structure;&#13;
approaches for the provision of power services in provincial and rural&#13;
areas;&#13;
(iv)   based on the recommended structure of section (iii), propose a suitable&#13;
organization for EDC taking into account the following:&#13;
-     role and degree of autonomy of the utility, specially for setting salaries and&#13;
employment conditions and procurement;&#13;
-     define in detail the organizational structure and functions of each&#13;
department;&#13;
-     review  the job descriptions of all line management positions and&#13;
recommend appropriate changes;&#13;
-     review draft performance contract between MIME and EDC and propose&#13;
recommendations for its effective implementation;&#13;
(v)   develop an implementation plan for the commercialization of EDC with public&#13;
ownership, including detailed time tables and an action plan, and define the&#13;
following aspects:&#13;
-     separation of finances including the transfer of existing assets and&#13;
liabilities to the new entity;&#13;
-     develop detailed specifications adopting fully new commercial approaches&#13;
including the application of international accounting and auditing&#13;
standards;&#13;
-     review the 10 years financial projections for EDC as an autonomous&#13;
corporation;&#13;
-     staffing implications, specially any issues with respect to: salaries and&#13;

and the formulation of a staff reduction program coordinated with a&#13;
program for promoting local private participation in sector activities;&#13;
prepare a development plan for the process of commercialization of EDC&#13;
(i.e. reorganization of the entity into an autonomous company responsible&#13;
for its investment and operation decisions), including an identification of&#13;
required legal and regulatory measures.&#13;

Phase II - Regulatory Framework&#13;
Based on the recommended structure for the power sector, the consultant should provide&#13;
a detailed outline of the required regulatory regime. In doing so, the following points&#13;
would be addressed:&#13;
-     identify the regulatory institutional arrangements necessary to address the sector&#13;
needs;&#13;
-     propose the relationship between the regulatory body and the existing government&#13;
entities;&#13;
-     define tariff setting principles and tariff mechanisms to encourage efficient&#13;
allocation of resources, energy conservation and financial self-sufficiency, while&#13;
responding to the needs of consumers;&#13;
-     define principles and mechanisms for pooling, energy dispatching and wheeling;&#13;
-     recommend functions of the regulator with respect to: provision of reliable&#13;
supply, licensing, safety, environment protection and dispute resolution;&#13;
-     define procedures for the approval and selection of proposals for private power&#13;
generation;&#13;
prepare detailed guidelines and procedures for each of the foregoing functions,&#13;
identifying the criteria, periodicity, participants and procedures to be involved in&#13;
ratemaking and investment proposals;&#13;
-     determine the rights and obligations of the power sector entities vis-a-vis the&#13;
regulatory institution, to other governmental entities and to the public;&#13;
-     propose modifications to existing legislation and procedures to implement the&#13;
recommended regulatory framework;&#13;
-     prepare drafts of new laws and regulations required for establishing the regulatory&#13;
framework;&#13;
-     propose an action plan for the implementation of the regulatory framework.&#13;
IV.   Organization of the Study&#13;
The study would be conducted by a consultant(s) with extensive practical&#13;
experience in the restructuring, regulation and commercialization of public enterprises,&#13;
including the power sector. The following expertise should be available:&#13;
-     power sector regulation and pricing;&#13;
-     utility finances, operation and maintenance;&#13;
-     personnel management;&#13;
-     commercialization and corporatization of public enterprises;&#13;
-     legal aspects of power regulation, commercialization and corporatization.&#13;
It is expected that the consultant will work closely with a task force to be set-up in&#13;
MIME. At the conclusion of each phase, study results and recommendations will be&#13;
presented in a seminar. Throughout the study the consultant(s) should report to MIME&#13;
and the World Bank.&#13;

Financial Planning Assumptions&#13;
1.   The balance sheet at I January 1994 is reconstructed in accordance with commercial&#13;
principles and opening balances derived from EDC's books adjusted or&#13;
consolidated.'  Fixed assets have been capitalised at 1994 valuation.  Generally&#13;
accepted accounting principles are followed thereafter.&#13;
2.   Sales and load projections and plant procurement plans are as made by EDC&#13;
consultants and presented in Annex 2.&#13;
3.   Riels are converted to $US at 2600=$1.00 in 1994 and at the following rates in&#13;
subsequent years: 2902, 3128, 3296, 3376, 3459, 3543, 3630, 3718, and in 2003,&#13;
3809.&#13;
4.   Domestic inflation is put at 10.5 per cent in 1995, 8 per cent in 1996 and 5 per cent&#13;
per annum in all subsequent years. International inflation is taken at 2.5 per cent&#13;
per annum all years.  Fuel prices and indexed components of IPP contracts are&#13;
assumed to change in line with international inflation.&#13;
5.   Revenue yield per kWh sold is based on the actual mix of sales and revenue for&#13;
October-December 1994 and is increased (a) over FYs 1996-2000 as distribution is&#13;
progressively taken over from wholesalers as the network is rehabilitated and (b)&#13;
according to international inflation for as long as necessary to achieve a target return&#13;
of eight per cent on average fixed assets in service.&#13;
6.   For calculation of fuel and purchased power costs, loads have been dispatched to&#13;
generating plants in merit order, commencing with fPP's and other new plants after&#13;
despatching not less than 10 per cent of the average annual requirement to EdC&#13;
plant. Capacity ratings and availabilities have been adjusted to reflect the condition&#13;
of existing plant and future wear and tear. EdC is assumed to retain ownership of&#13;
existing stations; some plant is moved from C2D to C3.&#13;
7.   IPP costs have been based on the contract for the No. I plant but for Nos. 2 and 3,&#13;
the capacity charge is assumed to be fixed. The table sets out the assumed costs&#13;
per kW per month of available capacity.&#13;
Plant      Commissioned        Initial $/lW/month    2003 $/kW/month&#13;
No. 1           FY 1996               25.84               30.72&#13;
No. 2           FY 1999               25.05               25.05&#13;

Any prior balances between Government entities are assumed to be written off; and any old&#13;
balances which should be paid to or collected from other bodies are assumed to be the&#13;
responsibility of the organisation under which they were incurred.&#13;
&#13;

Page 5 of 9&#13;
8.   Additions to fixed assets are at estimated current values and are assumed to be&#13;
commissioned progressively during the years of expenditure. In addition to known&#13;
projects the following other amounts (in 1995 prices) have been included in the&#13;
projected capital expenditure:&#13;
-    $8 million for completion of rehabilitation of the transmission and distribution&#13;
system in FYs 1998-2000&#13;
-    $2 million for construction of a new grid substation in FYs 1988-1999&#13;
-    $85 per new connection in FYs 1997 and 1998&#13;
-    $340 per kVA of annual increased peak load from FY 1999 for augmentation&#13;
and reinforcement of the network&#13;
9.   The financing schedule sets out expected and identified sources of external finance&#13;
and the balance remaining. $5 million of the WB credit is advanced in 1995 and&#13;
treated as equity, the remainder is treated as long term debt. Other 'toft" loans and&#13;
grants have been treated as equity.&#13;
10.  Operations and maintenance expense is provided at one per cent of opening fixed&#13;
assets at replacement cost rising to 1.8 per cent and escalated in accordance with&#13;
international inflation. (New assets are capitalised at the values current in the year&#13;
of commissioning but are not revalued during the forecast period.)&#13;
11.  Staff costs are directly estimated for 1996 allowing for resumption of LV&#13;
distribution and billing and subsequent growth and escalation are provided for at 10&#13;
per cent per annum. (Total employees at the end of FY 1994 were 1177.)&#13;
12.  Bad debts are allowed at 2.5 per cent of revenue in FY 1994 declining to one per&#13;
cent by 1998 and thereafter.&#13;
13.  Long term loans from ADB are assumed to be onlent at 7.5 per cent and repaid over&#13;
15 years after five grace years. WB loans are assumed to be at 10 per cent and&#13;
repayable on the same terms. Short term cash balances or borrowings are assumed&#13;
to earn or incur interest at 12 and 18 per cent per annum respectively.&#13;
14.  Working capital other than trade debtors:  fuel, one month's supply;  O&amp;M&#13;
materials, three months' usage; prepayments, opening balance x 1.05; creditors,&#13;
1.5 months' nonwage cash expenditure plus taxes.&#13;
Trade debtors are approx. 7.3 months' average revenue at 31 December 1994; they&#13;
are assumed to be brought down in successive years to 6.5, 5.5, 4.5, 3.5, 2.5, and 2&#13;
months by 2000 and to be maintained at not more than 2 months' thereafter.&#13;
15.  Asset lives for valuation and depreciation are:&#13;
-    generation plant and institutional assets, 25 years&#13;
-    transmission and distribution systems, 40 years&#13;
-  4 head office buildings and associated assets, 20 years&#13;

miscellaneous plant and equipment, seven years.&#13;
16.  The following payments to Government have been provided for in addition to any&#13;
taxes and duties levied on fuel and materials at date of projections:&#13;
-    turnover tax at one per cent of electricity revenue&#13;
-    income tax at nine per cent of net income, commencing when all past years&#13;
losses have been recouped&#13;
-    dividends equal to 60% of net income (profit) after tax once past years' losses&#13;
are recouped.&#13;

Economic Rate of Return&#13;
1.    The economic rate of return is calculated on the basis of the incremental economic cost&#13;
and benefit strearns associated with the project. The cost stream comprises: (a) investment in the&#13;
115 kV line and 115/22 kV substations under the project; (b) investments in the downstream&#13;
distribution network to support the demand growth and refurbishment of the existing system; (c)&#13;
incremental cost of energy purchased from IPP suppliers and produced by EDC's own plant&#13;
associated with the project; and (d) incremental operation, maintenance, billing and administration&#13;
costs due to the project. No shadow price was used for foreign exchange since the exchange rate&#13;
is set by the market. The principal benefit stream is associated with incremental electricity sales to&#13;
be supplied by the project. Additional benefits arise from the reduction of technical losses, and&#13;
improvements in the reliability of the system as a whole. All costs and benefits remain constant in&#13;
real terms (1994 values).&#13;
2.    The flow of incremental electricity demand is computed for six years, with a one-year time&#13;
lag after commencement of the first investment. The incremental demand is then served through&#13;
to the end of the economic life of the investment, which is 35 years from the commissioning of the&#13;
last item. The average growth rate of electricity demand is estimated at 28% p.a. for 1994-1999,&#13;
as the system is rehabilitated and suppressed demand is taken up, and 10% p.a. for 2000-2004.&#13;
Electricity sales are valued at the present average retail tariff of UScentsl6/kWh, ignoring&#13;
consumer surplus. The improvement in the system reliability is valued as reduced unserved&#13;
energy at UScents 1 8/kWh, which is the estimated cost of self-generation in Phnom Penh, and is&#13;
applied to total sales. Technical losses are assumed to decline from 14% to 8.6%. The reduction&#13;
in non-technical losses is assumed to be replaced gradually by legitimate consumption, and is&#13;
incorporated in the forecast sales. Generation cost is estimated at UScents9.2/kWh, which is the&#13;
average cost of supply; incremental operation and maintenance costs are estimated at 3% of the&#13;
capital cost of the investment; incremental billing and administration cost are assessed at 5% of&#13;
incremental sales.&#13;
3.    The internal economic rate of return of the project is 21.5%. The economic viability of&#13;
the project is tested for the cases stemming from project risks, namely cost overrun (+10% capital&#13;
cost), project implementation delay (up to 1 year), and a poor operation and maintenance&#13;
performance (higher O&amp;M costs and higher losses). The project is not expected to be sensitive to&#13;
variations in demand growth because there is currently a large suppressed demand. The results of&#13;
the ERR computation and sensitivity analysis are summarized in the following table. Details of&#13;
the calculation are given in Tables 15.2 to 15.6.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The main objective of the Phnom Penh
            Power Rehabilitation Project is to support the
            rehabilitation urgently needed for Phnom Penh's
            distribution system as well as the Government's initial
            efforts to strengthen sector institutions. Also, the project
            will help create an environment in which the power sector
            can be developed and operated efficiently, including the
            involvement of the private sector. To this end, the project
            will finance priority investments and provide much needed
            technical assistance. The project will include the following
            components: 1) rehabilitation of Phnom Penh's
            distribution system comprising construction of transmission
            circuits around the perimeter of Phnom Penh to connect three
            new primary 115/22k substations; construction of underground
            and overhead lines, low voltage lines, distribution
            transformers, power factor correction equipment and consumer
            connections; provision of support facilities including tools
            and equipment, communications for system operations, storage
            areas and logistic controls; and improvement of
            environmental and safety conditions at existing power
            plants; and 2) technical assistance comprising procurement
            and engineering, importation of management services,
            strengthening of commercial operations setting up an
