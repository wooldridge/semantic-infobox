ALBANIA&#13;
FORESTRY PROJECT&#13;
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
BORROWER:           Government of Albania&#13;
BENEFICIARY:        Ministry of Agriculture and Food and selected communes&#13;
AMOUNT:             SDR 5.5 million (US$8.0 million equivalent)&#13;
TERMS:              Forty years maturity with a ten year grace period. Credit proceeds would be lent&#13;
to the Government at the standard IDA charge.&#13;
PROJECT&#13;
OBJECTIVE:          The proposed project would have three principal objectives: (i) restore degraded&#13;
State-owned forest and pasture areas and promote their sustainable use; (ii)&#13;
promote the conservation of natural forest ecosystems; and (iii) take the initial&#13;
steps in the transition of the forestry/pasture sector to a market economy,&#13;
separating commercial from regulatory functions and establishing mechanisms for&#13;
self-financing of the commercial activities.  The project would support&#13;
institutional and policy reforms of Albania's forest and pasture sector and provide&#13;
resources for investments in the five components described below.&#13;
PROJECT&#13;
DESCRIPI'ION:       The project, to be implemented over six years (including a one-year pre-project&#13;
phase), would contain the following five investment components:&#13;
*     Institutional Development, including (i) reorganization and strengthening&#13;
of DGFP by decentralizing its management structure to the prefecture&#13;
level, developing capacity to manage its new roles in communal forest/&#13;
pasture and general pasture administration, and introducing skills&#13;
required for operating in a market economy; (ii) support for training,&#13;
education and research in forestry and pastures; (iii) project management;&#13;
(iv) project environmental management; and (v) technical assistance.&#13;
*     Improved State Forest Manaaement, including: (i) strengthening the&#13;
capacity of field services to manage and protect State forests;&#13;
(ii) resuming forest management planning; (iii) reforestation of sensitive&#13;
areas; (iv) pre-commercial thinnings; and (v) forest protection and pest&#13;
monitoring.&#13;
*     Forest Roads Rehabilitation and Maintenance, involving the rehabilitation&#13;
and subsequent maintenance of 350 km of degraded existing forest roads.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
iv&#13;
*      Management of Communal Forest and Pasture Areas involving: (i) the&#13;
implementation of a pilot project in three communes; (ii) development&#13;
of improved management plans for forests and pastures in 27 additional&#13;
communes; (iii) funding of selected communal investment projects; and&#13;
(iv) establishment of a data base on communally managed forests and&#13;
pastures.&#13;
PROJECT BENEFITS&#13;
AND RISKS:           Benefits. In relation to the principal project objectives the project's activities are&#13;
expected to generate the following benefits: (i) economic production benefits&#13;
from  restoring degraded forest and pastures;   (ii) direct and  indirect&#13;
environmental benefits from preventing losses from soil erosion, and enhancing&#13;
biodiversity and ecosystems protection and preservation of protected areas; and&#13;
(iii) institutional and policy improvements that are expected to lead to higher&#13;
degrees of efficiency and sustainability of use of a public renewable resource,&#13;
with provisions to safeguard stakeholder interests and the creation of positive&#13;
externalities through continued, but more focused public sector involvement.&#13;
Key indicators for progress would be: control of illegal harvesting operations;&#13;
application of new-style forest management methodology that would be geared&#13;
to multiple and sustainable forest use; achievement of the sector's financial&#13;
viability which in turn will depend on competitive marketing and trade&#13;
liberalization; and creation of an autonomous Forest Corporation to deal with&#13;
commercial, efficient exploitation of the resource.&#13;
Risks. Project risks regarding technical aspects of forest management, road&#13;
rehabilitation and communal forest and pasture management are considered low.&#13;
Albania possesses the basic expertise to deal with technical aspects of forest use.&#13;
The main risks of the project relate to uncertainties about the implementation of&#13;
the institutional and policy reforms. Critical elements are, first, the State must&#13;
regain control over forest management and exploitation. To this end, the project&#13;
focuses on the implementation of a monitorable action plan to reduce illegal&#13;
logging and the early strengthening of the administrative capacity through the&#13;
provision of physical inputs and staff reorientation and training. Second is the&#13;
need to achieve financial viability and sustainability within the sector. To this&#13;
end, market-oriented procedures, both in domestic marketing and external trade,&#13;
would be introduced to help overcome the current under-use and under-valuation&#13;
of the forest resource. Third is the need to improve the technical and economic&#13;
efficiency of forest and pasture operations. To this end, the project would&#13;
support the separation of commercial forest and pasture operations as the&#13;
responsibility of a financially autonomous enterprise from the regulatory and&#13;
policy activities that would remain part of the Government administration. The&#13;
risk to achieve the policy and institutional goals is mitigated by a relative long&#13;
adjustment and reform period of up to three years. This period would be used&#13;
to build capacity for dealing with the issues, achieve consensus within Albania&#13;
about the longer term arrangements for use of the forest and pasture resources,&#13;
and refine concepts and planning for the policy, legal and institutional actions.&#13;
This process would be helped by a proposed high-level seminar in year two to&#13;
review strategies proposed for the development of the sector, and the mid-term&#13;
review of the Project. The latter would be used to assess progress made in&#13;
resolving the above critical aspects and, depending on the outcome and&#13;
achievements, to confirm or adjust the design and scope of project activities, in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
v&#13;
particular the more heavy forest and road rehabilitation investments, as well as&#13;
communal investments, planned for the second half of the project.&#13;

FORESTRY PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1    Albania is going through a difficult transition from a strictly enforced centrally planned economy&#13;
to democratic and market economic conditions. Major structural adjustments involving agriculture,&#13;
enterprises and banking, and the provision of Government services, have been completed or are under&#13;
way. Reforms of economic policies have led to widespread liberalization of pricing, external trade, and&#13;
domestic marketing, making Albania one of the most open economies among the countries in transition.&#13;
Land and related assets that once were nationalized are now almost completely divested, either through&#13;
restitution to former owners (in urban areas), or through distribution to individual farming families&#13;
(former cooperative or State farm agricultural land). Preparations are under way to give full ownership&#13;
rights to the new land holders. A Mass Privatization Program has been initiated to privatize most of the&#13;
remaining State-owned enterprises and assets.&#13;
1.2    Forestry is a sector in Albania that, so far, has not benefited from the above structural changes&#13;
and that has been rather negatively affected by the transition. While the harvesting and processing&#13;
activities in the sector now take place through privatized or newly formed enterprises, forest management&#13;
is still bound into an old-fashioned State bureaucracy. Forest management and protection have been&#13;
particularly affected by the sudden end of the former command and control approach. Uncontrolled&#13;
harvesting has developed, continuing administered trade, pricing and marketing procedures generate&#13;
inefficiencies and distortions, and fiscal austerity has reduced the budget for the forest administration to&#13;
the point where it can only cover the payment of salaries and a few operational costs. A large backlog&#13;
has developed for investments in updating forest management plans, regeneration of harvested forest&#13;
areas, maintenance and protection of forests, rehabilitation of forest roads, replacement of worn-out&#13;
transport and equipment, upgrading of offices, and introducing more efficient market and incentive-&#13;
oriented procedures.&#13;
i.3    By law, Albania's forests, as well as pasture areas, are State-owned.' Forests comprise some one&#13;
million ha, or 38% of the country's land area, and together with over 0.4 million ha of State pasture&#13;
areas, about half of Albania's land area is administered by the Directorate General of Forests and Pastures&#13;
(DGFP) in the Ministry of Agriculture and Food (MAF). In spite of this vast natural resource base, the&#13;
contribution of forests and pastures to the country's economy has remained negligible. The sector&#13;
continues to be oriented toward meeting domestic requirements (which during the economic transition&#13;
phase shrank). Criteria of economic efficiency are only slowly taking hold in forest and pasture&#13;
management. Yet the potential exists to restore the sectors' productive capacities. The sector could not&#13;
only become self-financing, but a net contributor to the Government. It could also play important roles&#13;
for rural employment, industrial development, and for generating environmental benefits.&#13;
I Some 60,000 ha of State forest have been identified to have been owned by private persons or institutions before 1945 and&#13;
are proposed for restitution. The forest law (1992) and the pasture law (1995) permit State forest and pasture land to be transferred&#13;
to communes for usufruct.&#13;

1.4    Against this background, the Government of Albania has requested IDA assistance to help finance&#13;
this project. The project is based on a FAO/CP Forestry Sector Review in 1992 and project preparation&#13;
in 1993-1994, also supported by FAO/CP. An ecological survey of selected high forests was completed&#13;
in March 1995. The assessment of the existing forest cover using remote sensing was completed in May&#13;
1995. The environmental assessment was carried out between May and October 1995 and the report&#13;
issued in February 1996. Project appraisal by IDA and the cofinancing agencies was completed in&#13;
October 1995. The originally proposed farm forestry component of the project is now included under&#13;
an ongoing USAID-supported Private Forestry Development Program (APFDP). A pre-project phase&#13;
being financed with a $600,000 advance under the Project Preparation Facility (PPF), and also supported&#13;
by a Japanese PHRD Grant, is being implemented since March 1995.&#13;

CHAFrER II. THE FOREST AND PASTURE SECTOR&#13;
A. FORESTS AND PASTURES IN THE ECONOMY&#13;
2.1    The contribution of forests to the national economy is currently extremely low and greatly&#13;
reduced from its potential contribution. In 1990, forestry accounted for only 6 percent of the combined&#13;
value of output of agriculture, livestock and forestry although forest land occupied 40 percent of the total&#13;
land area. Livestock accounted for 36 percent of the output value; however, statistical data for livestock&#13;
is not broken down between output from agricultural land, from natural pastures and meadows, and from&#13;
non-land based animal husbandry such as pigs and intensive poultry.&#13;

B. FOREST AND PASTURE RESOURCES&#13;
2.2    Resource Base. Albania's total land area of 28,750 km2 is divided into three main ecological&#13;
zones: the coastal plain zone, with a southern area and a central and northern area; the hilly transition&#13;
sub-mountainous zone; and the mountainous zone. A more precise division shows five phyto-climatic&#13;
areas: (i) the Mediterranean shrub zone with broadleaved and conifer areas, (ii) the oak zone, (iii) the&#13;
beech zone, (iv) the fir zone, and (v) the alpine zone. Forests are mainly concentrated in the hilly and&#13;
mountainous zone, as can be seen in Map IBRD 27266 at the end of this report. Climatic and soil&#13;
conditions in Albania are favorable for forest and pasture growth. The annual precipitation varies&#13;
considerably from about 800 mm/year in the hills and the coastal plains to over 2,000 mm/year in the&#13;
mountain ranges. There is a dry period in the summer in the Mediterranean part of the country.&#13;
2.3    Albania has important and diverse forest resources. According to the 1995 reconnaissance survey&#13;
and forest cover map carried out by FAO2, the total area of forest cover in Albania is an estimated&#13;
1,155,000 ha. This area includes (i) garrigue and maquis (310,000 ha), (ii) high scrubs and degraded&#13;

forest coppice (340,000 ha), (iii) coniferous high forest (117,000 ha), and (iv) broadleaved forests&#13;
(398,000 ha), including both high forest and coppice. Broadleaved forests are mainly oak and beech,&#13;
while coniferous forests are predominantly black pine with small patches of silver fir and mountain pine.&#13;
Of the whole forest area, about 0.9 million ha, or 88 percent, is considered "productive" forest. The&#13;
remaining 12 percent forest area is non-productive, although it fulfills protective and social functions.&#13;
2.4    Albania's pasture land comprises about 406,000 ha. Sixty percent of that area is classified as&#13;
"winter pastures" covering lowland areas up to 1,500 m altitude; the remainder is "summer pasture" at&#13;
higher altitudes (up to over 2,500 m) including alpine vegetation. The importance of the pasture resource&#13;
is reflected in the fact that some 60 percent of the Albanian population is linked to pastoralism and&#13;
herding, mainly of sheep and goats.&#13;
2.5    Forest Types. The main types of Albanian forests are the following:&#13;
*      High Forests. They are managed according to traditional methods with thinnings and&#13;
regeneration felling aimed at value production. Regeneration is mainly done naturally&#13;
by leaving seed trees. When satisfactory seed trees are not present, regeneration is done&#13;
through replanting. High forest species are mainly beech (36%), black pine (23%), oak&#13;
(17%), maritime pines, and other broadleaves and conifers. The rotation period of high&#13;
forests is about 100-120 years;&#13;
-      [Coppice Forests. The main objective of coppice forests is to produce biomass for fodder&#13;
(from  oaks) and fuelwood through periodic cuts on a 40-50 year rotation.  The&#13;
dominating species is oak (82%), with small areas of beech (6%), and other broadleaves&#13;
(11%);&#13;
e      Shrub Forests. They produce fuelwood and fodder from periodic cuts and are used for&#13;
grazing livestock. Shrubs consist mainly of hornbeam (36%), arbutus (23%), and other&#13;
broadleaves. Arbutus produces an excellent fuelwood. The recommended rotation is 20&#13;
years;&#13;
*      Forest Plantations. Reforestation by planting started in the 1960s. Over 100,000 ha&#13;
were reforested by the end of 1991. Mostly pine species such as P. halepensis, P. nigra,&#13;
P. pinaster, P. radiata and P. pinea, were planted. The broad-leaved species planted are&#13;
Laurus nobilis, Juglans regia, Acer spp., Fraxinus spp., Tilia spp., and Betula spp. The&#13;
plantations were mainly established in the areas degenerated by over-exploitation and&#13;
heavy grazing; and&#13;
*      Farm Trees. Farm trees are scattered or in small plots on agricultural land (former State&#13;
and Cooperative farm land) and around houses. They represent more than 11,000 ha&#13;
equivalent, and mainly consist of poplars in the lowlands. Although almost all roadside&#13;
trees were cut down during the political change, interest in planting and maintaining trees&#13;
on the newly privatized farms is high.&#13;
2.6    Standing Timber Stock. During the review of the forestry sector by FAO/CP in early 19923,&#13;
the total standing stock was an estimated 81 million m3, of which 64 million m3 was in high forests,&#13;
10 million m3 in coppice forests, and 7 million m3 in high scrubs, maquis and guarrigue. This data was&#13;

based on a combination of figures compiled from the management plans of the high forest and results&#13;
from the inventory carried out in 1985 on the other forest types.&#13;
2.7    Age Distribution of Forest Trees. Commercial harvesting in high forests only started in the&#13;
1940s. The present age distribution in these forests is therefore uneven. Young stands of less than&#13;
20 years of age and mature stands of over 80 years are over-represented. Of the total area of beech, as&#13;
much as 71 percent is over 80 years and 39 percent over 120 years. In coppice forests, young forests&#13;
under 10 years are over-represented as well as forests over 40 years. According to statistics, the age&#13;
distribution in shrub forests is balanced.&#13;
2.8    Ownership. Forests and pastures are State-owned, except small, privately owned areas. The&#13;
1992 forest law and the 1995 pasture law both allow usufruct of State forest and pasture areas by&#13;
communes in their vicinity. The formal process of transferring forest and pasture land to communes has&#13;
not yet started, while some informal privatization of pastures is going on. The Government is restituting&#13;
to former owners some 60,000 ha of forests, and also additional pasture areas which had been&#13;
nationalized under the communist regime. Trees planted on former State and cooperative farms, except&#13;
orchards and wineyards, were distributed to farming families with the agricultural land, and are now&#13;
privately owned.&#13;
2.9    Forest Use. Albanian forests are used for the production of wood and non-wood products,&#13;
principally for the domestic market. Annual removals of wood during 1971-1980 averaged 4.6 million&#13;
-n3, about half as roundwood, one third as fuelwood, and the remainder as saw logs. In the 1980s, cuts&#13;
have decreased to between 2.5 - 2.9 million m3, with fuelwood taking up a larger share. During the&#13;
transition period in the 1990s, official removal of all wood has been declining from 1.5 million m3 in&#13;
1991 to below 0.6 million m3 in 1994. For the 1995/96 harvesting year, 0.6 million m3 (of which 0.4&#13;
million m3 comprised of timber and 0.2 million m3 of fuelwood) was offered for sale in auctions, but&#13;
less than half of this volume was sold due to lack of demand. However, simultaneously, self-collection&#13;
and illegal harvesting have increased. For instance, recorded illegal cuts amounted to 0.746 million m3&#13;
in 1991, 0.915 million m3 in 1992, and 0.380 million m3 per year in 1993 and 1994. According to&#13;
appraisal mission estimates, recorded and unrecorded illegal cuttings have likely exceeded legal harvesting&#13;
in 1995.&#13;

2.10   Degradation of Forest Resources. Albanian forest resources have degraded significantly over&#13;
the last five to 10 years. As part of the reconnaissance survey and forest cover map mentioned above&#13;
(see para. 2.3, footnote 2), FAO has made an assessment of forest change between 1988 and 1993. This&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Albatia Fonutfy Project                   Page -6 -                        Staff Appraial Report&#13;
assessment is for over 10 percent of the total forest cover in two representative areas. In these areas the&#13;
total forest cover has decreased by an average of 15 percent over a period of five years; the reduction&#13;
in area for the different forest types varies from one area to another. The likely reduction of standing&#13;
stock that goes with the reduction of forest cover is not precisely known.&#13;
2.11   The degradation of forest has been mainly caused by important, but unrecorded, human pressure&#13;
on forest resources. It includes uncontrolled wood-cutting and overgrazing, and is mostly concentrated&#13;
in the last five years. Field observations in 1995 suggest, however, that an increasing share of illegal&#13;
cutting is used as industrial timber. In parallel with degradation of forests, investments in forest&#13;
management have diminished considerably since the mid 1980s. Since 1990 they have been discontinued&#13;
as a consequence of dwindling Treasury resources allocated to the forestry administration.&#13;
C. FOREST MANAGEMENT, HARVESTING, FOREST ROADS AND WOOD INDUSTRY&#13;
2.12   Forest Inventory and Management Plans. Forest inventory and subsequent development of&#13;
forest management plans (FMPs) used to be carried out by the Forest Inventory and Management Section&#13;
of the Forest and Pasture Research Institute (FPRI). For the high forest, inventory was carried out on&#13;
one tenth of the total area every year, with a sampling intensity of 10 percent; FMPs were then prepared&#13;
for the inventoried area. Thus, about 40,000 ha of high forests were planned for the next 10-year period&#13;
every year. FMPs were developed at the level of management units, with an average size of 3,000 ha&#13;
(ranging from 1,000 to 5,000 ha). The main aim of forest management planning in the high forests is&#13;
to achieve an even age distribution in the management unit following the sustained yield principle. The&#13;
annual allowable cut is calculated based on the current annual increment of that management unit. The&#13;
development of FMPs has stopped since the late 1980s, which leaves about 75 percent of the high forests&#13;
in need of updating their FMPs. For the coppice and shrubs, a nationwide inventory over the total area&#13;
was made every 10th year, with a sampling intensity of 5 percent; a simplified management plan was&#13;
developed subsequently. The last inventory and simplified management plan of the coppice and shrubs&#13;
was done in 1985. No resources are available to update the simplified management plan of coppice and&#13;
shrub forests, which was due in 1995.&#13;
2.13   Forest Regeneration. About 90 percent of the forests in Albania are natural, and used to be&#13;
regenerated naturally. In the high forests, natural regeneration is carried out over 20-25 years for broad-&#13;
leaved species and 15-20 years for conifers. Natural regeneration was usually achieved through a&#13;
successive cutting program including: (i) a preparatory cutting that removes 25-30 percent of the growing&#13;
stock; (ii) a seed cutting, about 8-10 years following the preparatory cutting, that removes 25-30 percent&#13;
of the existing growing stock after a good seed year has been observed; and (iii) a final cutting that is&#13;
carried out when regrowth reaches about one meter height, 10-15 years after seed cutting. Careful&#13;
implementation of this program, together with routine support to natural regeneration including&#13;
complementary seeding, has been discontinued over the last five to 10 years. In about 15,000 ha of&#13;
harvested high forests, the regeneration is either incomplete or even absent. In the coppice, shrub, and&#13;
maquis, regeneration is achieved by coppicing, after clear cutting of the stand. The success of&#13;
regeneration of coppice and shrubs has been negatively affected in areas close to villages under high&#13;
pressure from livestock and fuelwood collection.&#13;
2.14   Forest Maintenance. Regular maintenance of young stands in the high forest, covering about&#13;
60,000 ha, has not been carried out in the 1990s. Pre-commercial thinnings have not been carried out,&#13;
and commercial thinnings have been carried out at a very low rate, representing only 5 percent of the&#13;
total harvest. This practice does not comply with FMPs under which thinnings should be carried out at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Albania Foreatry Project                  Page -7 -                         Staff Appmi6a Report&#13;
least three times (i.e., between the ages of 20-40, 41-60, and 61-100), removing 20 percent of the&#13;
growing stock each time. However, this rate has not been observed.&#13;
2.15   Forest Protection. Monitoring of the health and protection of Albanian forests against pests and&#13;
diseases has been inadequate. The most serious insect attacks are caused by Thaumatopoea pityocampa,&#13;
the pine processionary moth that has spread over about 45,000 ha in black pine stands since it first&#13;
appeared in 1985. Other important insect pests include Dioryctria splendidela and Evetria buoliana in&#13;
pine plantation, and Tortrix viridana and Lymantria dispar in oak stands. Serious fungi attacks are caused&#13;
by Endothia parasitica on chestnut, and Microsphaera alphitoides in oak stands.&#13;
2.16   Forest Harvesting Levels. As indicated above (para. 2.9 and Table 2.2), the level of actual&#13;
harvesting in the past has tended to exceed the AAC calculated by the FPRI. Most of this over-harvesting&#13;
has taken place in the coppice and shrub forests, but high forests close to habitations have also been&#13;
affected. In view of the obvious high utilization of coppice and shrub forests, and the fact that they have&#13;
not been completely degraded, there are reasons to believe that their production capacity has been&#13;
underestimated in the calculation of the AAC. However, in 1994 and 1995, the breakdown and&#13;
restructuring of Government-owned harvesting and processing enterprises, combined with severe budget&#13;
constraints of DGFP and a closed domestic market, led to the inverse situation that actual legal harvesting&#13;
has dropped significantly below the AAC.&#13;
2.17   Besides the over-exploitation in the past, there have been imbalances in the concentration of the&#13;
fellings. About 1 I percent of the growing stock is standing in areas not accessible by forest roads. This&#13;
amounts to more than nine million m3 of industrial wood on 66,000 ha. However, even the forests&#13;
inaccessible by forest roads have not remained fully intact as most of these forests have been exploited&#13;
by the local people.&#13;
2.18   Harvesting Methods.  (i) Most of the wood harvesting in State forests is carried out in&#13;
mountainous areas, where the terrain is difficult, as 80 percent of the forests grow on slopes of 20-50&#13;
percent inclination. Harvesting is based almost exclusively on the assortment method where the trees are&#13;
made into short assortments in the forest before off-road transportation. Average saw logs are four&#13;
meters long. Big dimension plywood logs can be even shorter. The minimum length is one meter for&#13;
fuelwood, parquet blocks, pulpwood and similar assortments. Long lengths are seldom used due to&#13;
difficulties in loading and unloading. (ii) Farmers and villagers use both the assortment method and the&#13;
stemwood method, where only the delimbing is done before off-road transportation. Fuelwood is mostly&#13;
hand carried or loaded on donkeys. Besides high productivity over short distances, donkeys and mules,&#13;
mostly used for skidding stems for construction timber, can move in conditions which are impossible for&#13;
skidders and other machines.&#13;
2.19   Forest Roads. The total length of Albania's forest roads is 3,518 km (as of 1993) from which&#13;
63 percent (2,237 km) has been built in high forests (1,727 km permanent, 510 km non-permanent). In&#13;
the coppice forests the length of roads is 1,281 km (508 km permanent, 773 km nonpermanent). Shrub&#13;
forests are served mainly by public roads because they are located near villages and along public roads.&#13;
As shrub land has little economic significance, no special roads have been made for them, although access&#13;
roads can cross them. Practically all forest roads were constructed after the 1950s at the rate of nearly&#13;
100 km annually. Forest roads have been constructed according to Albanian road classes IV and V. On&#13;
average, the density of forest roads is 3.5 m/ha. However, the density is normally increased to 15-20&#13;
m/ha in areas where final harvesting is taking place.&#13;
2.20   The main problem regarding forest roads in Albania is the degradation of the existing network&#13;
of class IV and V roads. The actual degree and extent of forest roads degradation is being surveyed by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Albania Forestry Project                     Page -8 -                         Staff Appraisal Repoit&#13;
the DGFP. At this stage, an estimated 25 percent of the existing network needs rehabilitation work in&#13;
order to limit further degradation. Another problem is that many areas are not accessible to truck&#13;
transport and commercial harvesting due to lack of suitable roads and steep slopes. Some of these forests&#13;
are therefore mature, or over-mature, considering the rotations normally applied in Albania. The FPRI&#13;
has estimated that there are at least 66,000 ha of comparatively large contiguous areas which could be&#13;
opened for harvesting. The growing stock of these areas exceeds 13 million m3 of which the share of&#13;
industrial wood is more than 9 million m3. However, some of these areas without access roads are&#13;
expected to harbor significant environmental values and interests. While the "1995 Ecological Survey&#13;
of High Forest Areas4" identified and categorized the future use of these areas, detailed site-specific&#13;
environmental assessments need to be carried out for those areas that could be opened up for future&#13;
harvesting. However, in view of the current lack of capacity in the forest administration to control illegal&#13;
logging, update and implement FMPs, and carry out environmental assessments and effective&#13;
environmental management, construction of new forest roads and opening up of new harvesting areas is&#13;
not included under the current forestry project.&#13;
2.21   Harvesting Enterprises. The former State-owned logging enterprises at the district level under&#13;
DGFP have all but collapsed in the transition process towards a market economy. New private sector&#13;
enterprises, often formed by employees and with assets of the former DGFP enterprises, have emerged&#13;
and carry out harvesting operations under competitive bidding for forest lots (auctions of stumpage&#13;
wood), in accordance with DGFP's forest management plans and under technical supervision by DGFP&#13;
district staff. However, due to the small number and size of competent harvesting and trading&#13;
enterprises, and the resultant lack of competition, wood is mostly sold at the minimum price set by DGFP&#13;
(see Table 2.3 below).&#13;
2.22   Wood Processing Industry.  In the past, about 35 wood processing enterprises had been&#13;
producing various products, including pulp and paper, sawn timber, veneers, plywood, particle board and&#13;
chipboard, parquet and furniture. The installed capacity of these wood industries (originally about one&#13;
million m' of industrial wood was processed annually) is in excess of the sustainable forest supply&#13;
(currently estimated at 0.6 million m3 of industrial timber). However, plant closures and managerial&#13;
difficulties during the transition and privatization, combined with old fashioned technology, production&#13;
methods and products, have resulted in significant under-use of this installed capacity. In 1995, the&#13;
domestic industry only processed some 0.1 million m3. Many enterprises have closed down. Lack of&#13;
coordination between the felling quota (AAC) and the actual processing capacity of the industry has also&#13;
led to serious wastage of raw material, as logs have been felled but not processed in time to prevent&#13;
decaying. Furthermore, haphazard trade policies which included export taxes, quotas, bans and other&#13;
restrictions, have aggravated the situation of over supply of the domestic market with industrial wood.&#13;
Most of the enterprises have now been privatized and a few of them entered into joint ventures with&#13;
foreign partners. The remaining ones are slated to be liquidated or included in Albania's Mass&#13;
Privatization Program being implemented in 1995 and 1996. The wood processing subsector is an area&#13;
of interest to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) that employed consultants&#13;
to identify a possible private sector wood processing project, but which did not progress beyond&#13;
identification.&#13;

D. TRADE, MARKETING AND PRICING OF FOREST PRODUCTS&#13;
2.23   External Trade. Imports of timber, both unprocessed and processed, are uneconomic due to low&#13;
domestic raw material prices and an import tariff (30%) on furniture. Albania's exports of forest&#13;
products were affected negatively by haphazard and inconsistent policies in the recent years. In early&#13;
1995, export quotas and license requirements were in place for logs, firewood, charcoal, edgings and&#13;
beams. In July 1995, these quantitative restrictions were replaced by an export ban on logs, poles, sawn&#13;
wood and fuelwood, while exports of all other forest products, including charcoal, were liberalized. The&#13;
restrictive trade regime prevents Albania from realizing the revenue and benefit potential from its forest&#13;
resource. It also tends to preserve imbalances in spatial resource use and technical inefficiencies in the&#13;
logging and processing industries. It provides the wood-processing industry with a non-targeted subsidy&#13;
in the form of cheaper wood. The elimination of trade barriers to allow domestic prices to rise close&#13;
to international levels is needed to make Albania's forestry sector economically and financially viable,&#13;
in particular, in a situation where the domestic industry is temporarily unable to process all timber that&#13;
is and can be harvested sustainably within the AAC, provided that suitable environmental safeguards are&#13;
being introduced. These environmental safeguards are currently not in place due to lack of capacity to&#13;
control illegal logging. In this situation, temporary trade restrictions, although imperfect and distortive,&#13;
can contribute to reduce the risk of over-exploitation of the resource. In the medium-term, the rather&#13;
distortive tradition to attempt regulating harvesting through trade barriers should be replaced by efficient&#13;
forest management and liberalization of external trade, including tariffs that are consistent with those for&#13;
other sectors of the economy.&#13;
2.24   Domestic Marketing and Pricing. The most common method for timber sale by DGFP is the&#13;
auction of standing timber in relatively small areas, typically less than 500 ha, that are accessible by&#13;
existing forest roads. Floor prices (see Table 2.3 below) are applied that have been derived by estimating&#13;
the cost to the State for producing the relevant category of wood over a given rotation period and taking&#13;
account of "reasonable international standards." Due to lack of demand and competition (para. 2.21&#13;
above), most sales are in fact closed at or slightly above these floor prices.  In 1994 and 1995, the&#13;
average floor price in Albania was about $13 per m3, which compares to stumpage values of $40 in&#13;
Central Europe, and up to $60 in Southern Europe.&#13;

2.25   Concessions. The other method of forest exploitation, which has, however, no clear legal&#13;
framework in Albania, consists of long-term contracts ("concessions") which combine timber harvesting&#13;
with road building in larger areas (up to 3,000 ha) that do not have road access. This method, which&#13;
does not involve a price bid for the standing timber, has so far only been used in isolated cases. The&#13;
contract is awarded on the basis of the quality of the proposal for forest management. The winning&#13;
contractor then purchases timber at existing floor prices adjusted downwards to reflect the magnitude of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Albania Forestry Project                    Page -10 -                          Staff Apprisal Report&#13;
estimated road building costs. A concession has the main advantage that it removes the need for outlays&#13;
by the Government for investments needed to open up new areas, and that it generates additional revenues&#13;
from harvesting. However, this method in its present form suffers from the main disadvantage that the&#13;
criteria by which proposals for concessions are to be evaluated are not easily measurable, and the&#13;
selection of contractors is bound to raise questions about the impartiality of the process. Meticulous&#13;
administrative processes are also required to avoid environmental risks.  Albania's forest and&#13;
environmental administrations are presently clearly not capable to properly handle contracts of this nature.&#13;
2.26   In the longer term, the principle of auction sales of timber, if truly competitive and accompanied&#13;
by an improved monitoring capacity to safeguard environmental values and long-term productivity of the&#13;
forest, should provide reliable indicators of the financial or economic viability of timber production in&#13;
each forest unit. It would be a flexible method to deal with issues of spatial variations in costs and also&#13;
the cost inter-dependence between fuelwood and timber production.&#13;
E. FOREST AND PASTURE POLICY AND LEGISLATION&#13;
2.27 Previous Forest Policies. Key aspects of Albania's forestry policy in the 1980s, though not fully&#13;
implemented, were: (i) reduce felling to a level which is compatible with sustained growth of the forest;&#13;
(ii) redirect harvesting from low yielding forests to over-mature stands; (iii) increase forest plantations,&#13;
especially coniferous ones; and (iv) reduce waste and inefficiency in logging and wood processing by&#13;
improved technology. The underlying law (Law No. 6607 of 1968, modified in 1983 and 1990) was&#13;
designed for the operation of a centrally planned system of forest management. Authorizations were&#13;
required for any forest related activity, i.e., logging, trade of wood, grazing and construction works in&#13;
the forest. This policy was limited to the production aspect of forestry and did not touch on other&#13;
relevant aspects, such as forest ownership and user rights, the role of the State in forestry activities, and&#13;
people's involvement.&#13;
2.28   Forest Legislation.   The Law on "Forestry and the Forest Police Service" (No. 7223 of&#13;
October 13, 1992) is today Albania's primary law on forestry.  It places greater importance on&#13;
environmental issues and economic management. The law defines the country's forest estate ("forest&#13;
fund") which comprises State, communal and private forests. State forest management remains the&#13;
responsibility of the forest administration, though the law does not specify the methods. Management&#13;
of private forest is not covered under this law. Communal forests are a newly introduced category that,&#13;
while still State-owned land, have the possibility of management by communes, jointly with the forest&#13;
administration. Private forests are those found on private land.5 Various subsidiary texts to the forestry&#13;
law have also been issued. These include regulations for the exploitation of forests, decisions on the&#13;
setting of stumpage and other forest fees, guidelines for auctions of standing wood, instructions for&#13;
protection against forest fires, a regulation containing the principles for the selection and establishment&#13;
of protected areas, and a regulation for the use of forests for recreational purposes. A "Wild Fauna and&#13;
Hunting Protection" law (No. 7875 of November 23, 1994) contains environmental provisions for wildlife&#13;
which are not contained in the forest law. It provides for the preparation of wildlife management plans&#13;
and constitutes an appropriate framework.&#13;
S In addition to existing pnvate (agricultural) land with forest flora, the Govemment has amended (May 1995) the forest law&#13;
to allow restitution of an estimated 60,000 ha of forst lands that were nationalized during the communist regime (1945-1989) (see&#13;
also pam. 2.8).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Albania Foraty Project                     Page -II -                         Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
2.29   Pasture Legislation. The Law on "Pasture and Grazing Land" (No. 7917 of April 13, 1995)&#13;
is relevant for land covered with grass and shrub used for pasture and mowing that belongs neither to the&#13;
agricultural land fund nor to the forest fund. It divides pastures and meadows into (i) State pasture land&#13;
administered by DGFP; (ii) State pasture land for general use, administered by the corresponding&#13;
municipality and commune; and (iii) private land, including group ownership. This Law goes further&#13;
than the above forest law towards decentralizing user rights to local government institutions and allowing&#13;
participation of the affected population. Communes are fully responsible for the technical and financial&#13;
management of communal pastures. Communes can also establish ten-year lease contracts with persons&#13;
interested in using communal pastures. DGFP's role in the system of communal and private pastures is&#13;
to approve changes in the use of such land, provide technical assistance (extension services) against&#13;
payment, and to protect pastures and meadows from damages.&#13;
2.30   Environmental Legislation. A Law on "Envirorunental Protection" (No. 7664 of January 21,&#13;
1993) is relevant to forestry and pastures since it requires environmental impact assessments and licenses&#13;
for activities that may have a significant impact on the environment. Environmental licenses, issued by&#13;
the environmental authority (see para. 2.38 below), are required for a wide variety of activities such as&#13;
building of infrastructure, exploration and exploitation of soil, forests, wildlife and fish, and dealing with&#13;
hazardous substances. Draft regulations have been prepared for environmental impact assessments&#13;
which, additional to the necessity of issuing licenses, are to be prepared at the request of the&#13;
environmental or local authorities, principally by the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP).&#13;
These regulations provide for public participation at each step in the process. The environmental law also&#13;
requires compliance by Albania with "generally accepted norms and principles" of international&#13;
environmental law. A draft law on the "Protection of Nature and Biological Diversity" is under&#13;
discussion in Albania which should reflect the national strategy on nature and biodiversity conservation&#13;
for which preparations have been initiated in Albania.&#13;
2.31   Key Policy Objectives. Albania's draft Constitution reconfirms State ownership over forest and&#13;
pasture land that has historically always been a national asset. The basic legal and policy framework for&#13;
the economic and sustainable development of the sector is in place. However, the forest law needs fine-&#13;
tuning to clarify both the production and conservation objectives of forest management, user and&#13;
ownership rights, in particular with the intended transfer of forests to communal management, and the&#13;
sustainable and multiple use of forests on private land. The country also lacks an explicit statement of&#13;
the principles of its forest and pasture policy, that specify its long-term goals, principles and operational&#13;
directions.  However, policy objectives can be derived from the above legal framework, the actions&#13;
already taken, and also from the Government's involvement in the design of the proposed project. The&#13;
national objectives are seen in the intention of the Government to develop the sector in three major&#13;
thrusts: (i) develop the sector's economic potential on a sustainable basis; (ii) ensure that sound&#13;
environmnental and nature conservation criteria are applied in this process; and (iii) reduce Government&#13;
involvement in the sector through divestiture of enterprises and functions, transfer of user rights, and&#13;
institutional reforms.&#13;
F. INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
2.32   Directorate General of Forests and Pastures (DGFP). Forests and pastures in Albania are the&#13;
responsibility of DGFP which reports to the Minister of Agriculture and Food. Wood processing is part&#13;
of the portfolio of the Ministry of Industry, Transport and Trade, after an intermittent assignment to&#13;
DGFP in 1991 and 1992. DGFP has its headquarters in Tirana, with operational sections for control,&#13;
pastures, fauna, forest protection, forest extraction, silviculture, and economics and privatization.&#13;
Headquarters staff totals 32, of whom, 23 are university graduates and five technicians. Until 1994,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Albania Forestry Project                     Page -12 -                           Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
forest operations in the field were managed from 36 district forest offices, but now 12 prefectures exist&#13;
be.tween headquarters and the districts with forest staff included.6 Below the districts are 124 sector forest&#13;
offices, each averaging about three "forest economies" and comprising 2,500 - 3,000 ha of forests.&#13;
District offices are responsible for implementing forest management plans and applying regulations. In&#13;
particular, they are in charge of establishing forest plantations, marking trees for exploitation, organizing&#13;
sales and auctions and supervising harvesting operations. They also have a policing function and are to&#13;
enforce the forest legislation. Furthermore, DGFP district offices are in charge of managing national&#13;
parks and other protected areas which coincide with specific forest sectors. In 1995, DGFP field offices&#13;
at the district level and below had a staff of 1595, of whom 425 were university graduates and 991&#13;
technicians.&#13;
2.33   Until recently, DGFP oversaw 18 State pasture enterprises. In addition to its forest offices, these&#13;
pasture enterprises had a staffing of some 270, of whom 86 were professionals and 162 technicians. With&#13;
the passage of the pasture law, the structure of separate pasture offices is being discontinued. About 70&#13;
percent of the pasture staff will be integrated into the forest districts. The remainder will be assigned to&#13;
communes, in particular, in the areas of winter pastures that are expected to be transferred to communes&#13;
over time.&#13;
2.34   Forest Management Implementation. The overall capacity of DGFP to manage State forests&#13;
has been considerably hampered due to harsh financial constraints since the early 1990s. Although&#13;
Albanian foresters are well trained, and used to manage State forests satisfactorily in the past, they lack&#13;
the basic equipment, infrastructure, and financial resources to perform their duties as managers of state&#13;
forests. These duties are administering the State forest and pastoral domain, implementing forest&#13;
management plans, organizing wood harvesting and marketing, organizing grazing on forest and pasture&#13;
land, carrying out investments in forests and pastures, caring for nurseries, enforcing environmental law&#13;
and policies, managing hunting and fishing, and administering budgets and revenues, and employment&#13;
of staff and workers.&#13;
2.35   Forest Research.&#13;
(a)    The Forest and Pasture Research Institute (FPRI) is responsible for: (i) applied research&#13;
activities in the field of forestry and pasture management, (ii) conducting forest&#13;
inventories, and (iii) preparing forest and pasture management plans. Administratively,&#13;
the Institute is attached to the Directorate of Science and Qualification at the Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture and Food. It has five research sections, the subjects of which are: forestry&#13;
and genetics, management, inventory, harvesting and pastures, protection (pests, fires),&#13;
and oil-bearing and medicinal plants. In 1993, the Institute had 49 professional staff, but&#13;
its activities have been very much reduced in recent years due to lack of funding. In&#13;
1994, the Institute, under contract with the World Bank, carried out the Ecological&#13;
Survey of Selected High Forest Areas that significantly influenced the design of the&#13;
forestry project by eliminating interventions to open up new harvesting areas.&#13;
(b)    The Forestry Faculty of the University of Agriculture in Tirana is also involved in&#13;
forestry research.&#13;
2.36   Forestry Education and Training. High level education in forestry is the responsibility of the&#13;
Forestry Faculty in the University of Agriculture in Tirana which also includes the faculties of agronomy,&#13;
6 The 12 prefect forest offices will also double as district forest offices, thus reducing the latter to 24.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Albania Forestry Project                   Page -13 -                         Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
veterinary and economics. The Faculty was founded in 1959 and, until the early 1990s, trained more&#13;
than 800 forest engineers. The curricula are organized over 5 years according to two profiles: (i) forestry&#13;
generalists, with a sub-specialization in silviculture or forest exploitation; and (ii) wood technology&#13;
specialists. The target is to graduate 20 students a year for the first profile and 10 a year for the second.&#13;
2.37   Intermediate training in forestry is the responsibility of the Forest Technician School located in&#13;
Shkoder. The present situation of the school is a cause for concern, as it lacks means to perform. Until&#13;
1994, the school had the same curricular paths as the Forestry Faculty, but now there are three divisions&#13;
or subject areas: (i) silviculture and greening; (ii) forest harvesting; (iii) furniture. Each division recruits&#13;
40-50 new students per year who have completed 8 years of primary education. There are 31 teachers,&#13;
of whom 6 are forestry engineers and one is a wood industry specialist. The length of curriculum is 5&#13;
years for the first two divisions and 4 years for the third. About 15-30 percent of the students who&#13;
graduate from the Technician School enter the Forestry Faculty in Tirana for further academic education.&#13;
2.38   Environmental Institutions. The Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP) is the central&#13;
authority for coordination of environmental affairs. Administratively, CEP is placed under the Ministry&#13;
of Health and the Enviromment. CEP gives final approval for environmental impact assessments. CEP&#13;
has a small professional staff of eight, including the chairman and seven specialists divided over three&#13;
directorates.  Forestry is grouped under the Natural Resource Protection and Soil Rehabilitation&#13;
Directorate. It is the Directorate's responsibility to monitor government activities in its functional areas&#13;
and register objections when environmental concerns are flouted. The Directorate head also represents&#13;
environmental interests on a commission that select larger forest exploitation projects.  CEP was&#13;
strengthened in 1994 with the establishment of Environmental Regional Agencies at the Prefectures.&#13;
Other environmental institutions of note include the Museum of Natural Sciences, the Faculty of Natural&#13;
Sciences at the University of Tirana, and the Institute for Biological Research. There are also a number&#13;
of environmental NGOs: the leading ones active in public awareness efforts are the "Society for the&#13;
Protection and Preservation of the Natural Environment in Albania", and the "Albanian Society for the&#13;
Protection of Birds and Mammals."&#13;
2.39   Local Government. Under Albania's decentralization policy, a new structure of central and local&#13;
government is being established to give more autonomous decision-making, management and&#13;
responsibility to communes (and municipalities for the large cities). Twelve prefectures, appointed by&#13;
the Council of Ministers, represent the central Government within new administrative-territorial units and&#13;
coordinate and supervise the work of ministries. Communes that comprise two or more villages are the&#13;
lowest level of local government with legal status and own budget. They are represented by communal&#13;
councils whose members are elected directly by the population. Districts are made up of several related&#13;
communes and are represented by district councils that are also directly elected. New pasture legislation&#13;
has now been passed allowing for the transfer of State assets to communes, and the rules for managing&#13;
communal assets are under preparation. Concerning forests and pastures, the elected council has the&#13;
responsibilities of managing the resources of the commune or municipality; of taking the measures for&#13;
the protection and revival of the environment; and of encouraging private initiatives.&#13;
G. FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF FOREST SECTOR DEVELOPMENT&#13;
2.40   Fiscal Expenditure.  DGFP as an agency of MAF is bound by the Government's financial&#13;
mechanisms that require it to transfer all its income from sales, leases and services to the Treasury, and&#13;
to operate on an annual budget that is decided by the Council of Ministers and transferred to DGFP&#13;
directly from the Treasury (by-passing MAF). Until 1990, the total annual budget of DGFP amounted&#13;
to the equivalent of about US$75 million, of which about US$10 million was allocated to forest&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Albania Forestry Project                      Page -14 -                            Staff Appraisad Repoft&#13;
management. However, at that time the budget included the forest enterprises responsible for forest&#13;
management, and the logging, distribution and wood processing enterprises, but excluded pasture&#13;
enterprises, which were under a separate department of MAF.  In 1992, with processing enterprises&#13;
transferred to the Ministry of Industry, the annual budget dropped to the equivalent of about US$3 million&#13;
and remained at a level of between US$2-3 million until 1995. Compared with the State budget&#13;
expenditure totaling the equivalent of about US$680 million in 1994, DGFP expenditure of about&#13;
US$2.6 million for forestry in the same year represents a very small portion of Albania's public&#13;
expenditure, absorbing less than 0.4 percent. From these DGFP expenditures, US$2.5 million was&#13;
allocated for recurrent expenditures, of which two-thirds for personnel costs, and only about&#13;
US$0.1 million, or a negligible amount, for investments (see Table 2.4 below).&#13;

2.41    Fiscal Income.  90-92 percent of the income from  forestry consists of wood sales, and the&#13;
remainder comes from hunting, non-wood products and fines. Largely because of the decline of the&#13;
domestic market demand in the transition period (para. 2.16 above), the wood sales revenues dropped&#13;
significantly from over US$5 million equivalent in 1991 to an estimated US$1 million in 1994 (see Table&#13;
2.5 below).&#13;

2.42   Fiscal Balance. With the exception of 1992, fiscal expenditures for forestry during these years&#13;
of transition have exceeded fiscal income from forest activities, making the sector a drain on central&#13;
Government resources. Shifts have also taken place in the composition of expenditures. In spite of high&#13;
inflation until 1993, the total budget for forestry has remained fairly constant in nominal terms, while the&#13;
share of salaries has increased at the expense of investments. As a consequence, investments in forestry&#13;
operations such as afforestation, complementary plantings, cultural works and improvement thinnings&#13;
were drastically reduced. The continuation of administered prices, with stumpage fees and fuelwood&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Albania Foreay Project                     Page -15 -                         Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
prices below international levels, discrepancies between harvested and sold wood volumes, and increased&#13;
harvesting outside DGFP's control have negatively affected the income situation.&#13;
H. POLICY ISSUES AND REFORMS&#13;
2.43   The key policy issues that concern the forestry sector are summarized in the policy matrix&#13;
presented in Appendix 1. The matrix also proposes the actions that need to be taken to achieve the&#13;
objectives that are derived from the identified deficiencies. The main issues are:&#13;
(a)    Deficiencies in forest conservation and management that: (i) do not prevent illegal&#13;
harvesting of industrial timber and over-harvesting of coppice and shrub forests; and&#13;
(ii) reduce the sustained productivity of wood and non-wood products;&#13;
(b)    Lack of financial resources due to:  (i) barriers to international trade leading to&#13;
underpricing of domestic products; and (ii) under utilized potential for revenue&#13;
generation; and&#13;
(c)    Slow adjustment of the forest administration to a market economy due to: (i) a human&#13;
resource base that is not prepared for the efficient implementation of productive and&#13;
protective forestry activities; and (ii) inadequate facilities and programs for education,&#13;
training and research.&#13;
I. RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.44   The updated Country Assistance Strategy of the Bank (1995) emphasizes infrastructure&#13;
development and selected projects for poverty alleviation as priorities for development. The forestry&#13;
project would make a major contribution toward effecting change in the forestry/pasture sector at the&#13;
national level, in particular introducing principles of use of natural resources that are both sustainable and&#13;
market-oriented, and redefining the public and private roles. The serious lack of domestic fiscal&#13;
resources affecting all sectors in Albania, will require substantial foreign assistance, both financial and&#13;
technical. IDA is in a position to help fill this gap and mobilize further external assistance. Italy has&#13;
been providing credit for emerging private forest enterprises and is committed to cofinance the forestry&#13;
project with a soft loan and a technical assistance grant. Switzerland is also committed to provide&#13;
technical assistance support for certain forestry and pasture activities in connection with the project. In&#13;
parallel, USAID has started a private forestry development program (APFDP) that provides policy advice&#13;
and monitoring services for the sector, supports farm forestry, and fosters communal forest and pasture&#13;
management, the latter, similar to the IDA project component. EBRD is interested in supporting the&#13;
development of the wood industry. Thus, IDA's involvement in Albania's forest and pasture sector&#13;
would mainly be to: help develop a sound overall policy and institutional framework, re-orient education&#13;
and training for forest professionals, improve State forest management and use to increase its productive&#13;
capacity and halt the ongoing degradation, introduce communal management of forest and pasture areas&#13;
under a participatory approach, and improve management of protected areas on a pilot basis, while&#13;
ensuring sound environmental practices in all activities.&#13;

ALBANIA&#13;
FORESTRY PROJECT&#13;
CHAPTER III.   THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND SUMMARY DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.1    Objectives. The project would have three principal objectives: (i) restore degraded State-owned&#13;
forest and pasture areas and promote their sustainable use; (ii) promote conservation of natural forest&#13;
ecosystems; and (iii) take the initial steps in the transition of the forestry/pasture sector to a market&#13;
economy, separating commercial from regulatory functions and establishing mechanisms for self-financing&#13;
of the commercial activities.&#13;
3.2    Summary Description. The project would support institutional and policy reforms of Albania's&#13;
forest and pasture sector and provide resources for investment in the following five main components:&#13;
(i) institutional development of the forest/pasture administration including related training, education and&#13;
research and the establishment of a project environmental management unit; (ii) improved management&#13;
of State forests; (iii) rehabilitation of forest roads; (iv) management of communal forest and pasture&#13;
areas; and (v) management of protected areas.&#13;
B. DETAILED FEATURES&#13;
Institutional Reform [See also the chart in Appendix 2, and Annex A of the Supporting Volume]&#13;
3.3    Approach. Over a three year period, the project would support the transition from the current&#13;
departmentally organized, all-encompassing forest and pasture administration, to a new institutional setup&#13;
that would separate the commercial from the policy/regulatory/public goods functions. This proposed&#13;
new institutional setup was preferred to the alternative of maintaining, and developing over the long-term,&#13;
the Government line department for all forest and pasture activities.  The separation will allow&#13;
commercial forestry operations to be placed in a commercially oriented entity, tentatively named "Forest&#13;
Corporation," where these functions can be performed in a more flexible, efficient and responsible way.&#13;
Efficiency improvements would result in part from the pressures of a market economy, and in part from&#13;
the participation of a broader range of stakeholders in the administration of natural resources who would&#13;
be represented in the Corporation's Board of Directors. The key to success will be that this new entity&#13;
(i) mainly acts as a management agent for the forest and pasture resources entrusted to it by the State and&#13;
uses private sector contractors and services on a competitive basis for implementation of its operational&#13;
plans; (ii) is directed by the stakeholders of the resources it exploits which not only include a broader&#13;
range of Government agencies beyond the Ministry of Agriculture, but also the private sector, affected&#13;
communes and villages, and NGOs; and (iii) maintains flexibility as to its structure, ownership and&#13;
operational approaches to adjust to evolving changes of socio-economic and technical conditions. The&#13;
creation of the proposed autonomous Forest Corporation will depend on the resolution of a number of&#13;
current issues affecting the sector's efficiency which include the clarification and further improvement&#13;
of the legal framework (forestry law, biodiversity law), implementation of policy reforms (control of&#13;
illegal logging and introduction of improved forest management, competitive timber marketing and&#13;
pricing, liberalization of timber trade, para. 3.9-3.11 below) and the establishment of an effective&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Albania Foreutry Project                  Page -17 -                       Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
environmental management system (para. 3.6 below). The proposed separation of functions in the forest&#13;
administration will also, on the other hand, allow concentration of non-commercial services in a smaller,&#13;
tighter government line unit that ensures continuity of policies, regulatory control, provision of public&#13;
services and funding of targeted interventions. In view of the uncertainties regarding the resolution of&#13;
the current sector issues, project activities have been dimensioned and phased in a way that, except for&#13;
development of institutions, staff and procedures and the implementation of pilot projects, the bulk of the&#13;
investments in forest and civil works in the State forests and communes will be made after progress made&#13;
in resolving the above sector constraints and in defining the future institutional structure has been assessed&#13;
during the project's mid-term review (para. 4.12). During negotiations of the credit, agreement was&#13;
reached on the phased approach for project implementation and the criteria and timing for the&#13;
establishment of the future Forest Corporation.&#13;
3.4    Forest Corporation. At about the end of year three of the project, DGFP is expected to&#13;
transform into a managerially and financially autonomous Forest Corporation (FC). FC would likely be&#13;
established in accordance with Albania's Law on State Enterprises. It would operate along commercial&#13;
principles and be principally responsible for the efficient management and exploitation of productive State&#13;
forests and pastures. FC would retain the forest and pasture revenues that currently accrue to Treasury.&#13;
FC would finance its operating and investment expenditures from these revenues, except for specific&#13;
national development projects such as the Forestry Project, which would continue to be funded from the&#13;
Treasury under contractual agreements. From its revenues, FC would make contributions to the Treasury&#13;
in the form of a fixed annual fee (rent) or a variable charge for the products it sells based on volume or&#13;
value (for instance, stumpage fee for timber, or royalty), to compensate the State for the use of nationally&#13;
owned productive assets. Furthermore, FC would be expected to pay dividends to its shareholders (the&#13;
Government and/or private investors) and corporate or income tax on its profits, currently 30 percent.&#13;
FC would also be subject to the usual sales taxes or value added tax for its turnover.&#13;
3.5    Forest and Pasture Department. In parallel with the establishment of FC, administrative&#13;
functions of policy development for the sector; regulatory control; planning, monitoring and evaluation&#13;
of the sector's activities; provision of public services to sector agents (information, extension, education,&#13;
research); management and assistance for communal forest and pastures; and protected areas management&#13;
would continue as departmental Government services in a streamlined Forest and Pasture Department&#13;
(FD) within the Ministry of Agriculture and Food (MAF) with funding provided from the central&#13;
Government budget.&#13;
3.6    Forest Environmental Management. In addition to the above future structure of the forest&#13;
administration, the project would establish within the Agricultural Program Office of MAF a Project&#13;
Environmental Management Unit (PEMU) (see also para. 4.1 (c)) that would remain separate both from&#13;
overall project management as well as from DGFP and the future FC. Its primary responsibility would&#13;
be to promote the conservation of the nature in the forests by monitoring the implementation of the&#13;
recommendations and mitigating measures under the Government endorsed Ecological Survey and&#13;
Environmental Impact Assessment reports. To facilitate this task, PEMU would monitor environmental&#13;
developments and adherence to standards in the forest and pasture sector, establish and operate an&#13;
environmental data base for the sector, and prepare periodic status reports including a baseline report on&#13;
environmental conditions of forests and pastures in Albania. It would also provide guidance and support&#13;
to project management (Steering Committee and PMU, see para. 3.8, and 4.1(a) and (b) below) and to&#13;
DGFP. Furthermore, PEMU will be used to channel technical assistance to the Committee for&#13;
Environmental Protection under the Ministry of Health and Environment to help fulfil CEP's institutional&#13;
role in respect of the project. Over time and in line with Government policies, PEMU would be expected&#13;
to assume a broader environmental management responsibility for all of MAF's activities. During&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Albania Foreaty Project                  Page -18 -                       Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
negotiations of the credit, agreement was reached on the terms of reference for a PEMU in MAF, and&#13;
its establishment no later than January 1, 1997.&#13;
3.7   Interim Period and DGFP Revenue Account. For the interim period of two to three years until&#13;
the establishment of FC, during which the project would help make forest/pasture operations&#13;
progressively viable financially and environmentally, and during which the ultimate design of Albania's&#13;
future forest administration and its financial relationships with the State and the markets will be refined&#13;
and agreed, DGFP and Treasury would establish a "Revenue Account" within DGFP. This Account&#13;
would remain outside project funding flows and would initiate the re-direction of investment resources&#13;
by accumulating and channelling an increasing share of Treasury revenues from forest and pasture sales&#13;
towards specific direct investments by DGFP in the following year, as approved by the Project Steering&#13;
Committee (para. 3.8 below). A simple pre-determined formula, starting at 50/50 in the fourth quarter&#13;
of 1996, would be used to split these revenues between Treasury and DGFP and increase the share of&#13;
DGFP by five percentage points in each of the subsequent years. Treasury would continue to receive part&#13;
of the sector revenues and would continue to fund through the Government's central budget mechanism&#13;
DGFP's recurrent costs (staff salaries, staff benefits, and operating costs corresponding to the "without&#13;
project" situation), including DGFP's non-_ommercial and regulatory services. During negotiations of&#13;
the credit, an assurance was obtained that the draft decision or law to establish the Revenue Account&#13;
would be provided to IDA by July 15, 1996.&#13;
3.8    Project Steering Committee. A Steering Committee would be established within MAF that&#13;
would be responsible for the allocation of project resources and also of the local investment resources&#13;
generated under the DGFP Revenue Account mechanism (para. 3.7). The Steering Committee's voting&#13;
members would comprise the Minister of Agriculture as Chairperson, the Director of the Agricultural&#13;
Program Office (APO), the Project Director (PMU), the Head of PEMU and the Director General of&#13;
DGFP. In addition, the Steering Committee would draw on the expertise of non-voting, non-permanent&#13;
members representing a broad range of public and private sector interests in forestry and pastures,&#13;
including the Ministry of Health and Environment, Ministry of Construction and Tourism, local&#13;
governments, private sector, and non-governmental organizations. The Steering Committee would also&#13;
rely on a Forest Policy Advisory Group that has been established within DGFP under the USAID-funded&#13;
APFDP.&#13;
Policy Reforms [See also the Policy Matrix in Appendix 1, and Annex J of the Supporting Volume]&#13;
3.9    Control of Illegal Forest Harvesting. Illegal timber and fuelwood harvesting activities have&#13;
increased in some locations in recent years, resulting in revenue loss for the Government, wastage of&#13;
timber, and devastation of harvesting areas. Illegal logging needs to be kept in check to justify&#13;
investments in forest management, road infrastructure and protected areas. Vehicles and communications&#13;
equipment were provided to DGFP in the pre-project phase with funding from the PPF to help build its&#13;
capacity for improving the policing of forests and controlling timber transport at road check points and&#13;
sawmills. During negotiations of the credit, agreement was reached on the content and targets of DGFP's&#13;
Action Plan to Reduce Illegal Forest Harvesting (a summary is in Appendix 9). The Plan also includes&#13;
training and motivation workshops for DGFP staff, publicity campaigns to obtain the cooperation of the&#13;
local population, and close collaboration with the law enforcement and judicial authorities.&#13;
3.10   Marketing and Pricing Reforms. Competitive procedures (auctions) for the domestic marketing&#13;
of forest and non-forest products and the use of pasture areas would be further improved under the&#13;
project. All remaining administratively set prices would be liberalized (fuelwood prices had been&#13;
liberalized in April 1994). However, floor prices for auctions of timber and fuelwood would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Albania Foreatry Project                  Page -19 -                        Staff Appaiaal Report&#13;
maintained based on current replacement costs for these products. Improvements would be introduced&#13;
for the composition of the timber auction commissions, the process of marking trees for harvesting, and&#13;
the timing and location of auctions. During negotiations of the credit. agreement was reached on (i) the&#13;
adoption of improved marketing and pricing procedures for timber and fuelwood; (ii) their introduction&#13;
no later than July 1, 1996; and (iii) maintenance of such marketing and pricing procedures, acceptable&#13;
to IDA.&#13;
3.11   Trade Policy Reform. The current ban on the export of logs, poles, sawn wood and fuelwood&#13;
(following a period of export quotas, licensing and export taxes until June 1995) limits the volume of&#13;
forest sales, depresses domestic prices, and is thus one of the major factors preventing the sector from&#13;
becoming financially viable. These conditions have contributed to the under-use of harvestable timber&#13;
resources, low fiscal revenues and investment, and the preservation of wasteful and inefficient&#13;
technologies. In order to facilitate more efficient use of Albania's forest resources and enhance the&#13;
overall financial viability of the sector, exports of forest products should be fully liberalized by&#13;
eliminating the existing trade ban. This liberalization would, however, be contingent upon DGFP&#13;
regaining effective control over the forests (para. 3.9 above) and the updating of the annual allowable cut&#13;
(AAC). Free external trade and competitive domestic marketing, combined with initial institutional&#13;
reforms and strengthening to ensure environmentally sound and sustainable forest production, would lead&#13;
to higher domestic prices (and higher marketed volume within the allowable cut). This in turn would&#13;
allow to increase the floor price of stumpage, currently very low, and generate substantial additional fiscal&#13;
revenue. While quantitative restrictions for exports of forest products would be eliminated (in effect,&#13;
control of trade would be replaced by harvesting control in the forests), the re-emerging timber industry&#13;
would continue to be protected by import tariffs on processed timber products. During negotiations of&#13;
the credit agreement was reached that IDA and the Government would exchange views on the adequacy&#13;
of DGFP's control over forest harvesting no later than during the project's mid-term project progress&#13;
review (see also para. 4.12).&#13;
Project Investments&#13;
3.12   The project, to be implemented over six years (including a one year pre-project phase funded by&#13;
the PPF and with TA support by a Japanese Grant), would contain the following five investment&#13;
components:&#13;
(1)   Institutional Development ($5.1 million base cost including $2.95 million in grant funded&#13;
technical assistance). This would include the following activities:&#13;
(a)    Reorganization and Strengthening of DGFP ($0.6 million base cost) [For details&#13;
see Annex A of the Supporting Volume]: DGFP, as part of MAF, would be&#13;
reorganized by (i) decentralizing its management by establishing an administrative&#13;
structure at the prefecture level to better serve district and sector offices with&#13;
personnel and finance management, marketing, engineering design and forest&#13;
management planning; (ii) developing capacity to manage its new roles in&#13;
communal forest and pasture management, and in pasture administration and&#13;
development in general, through integration of management functions of the&#13;
former pasture enterprises into the mainstream forest administration; (iii)&#13;
developing market economy skills fcr bidding, contracting, marketing, financial&#13;
management and involvement of the private sector through information and&#13;
training campaigns; and (iv) establishing and operating a "Revenue Account" to&#13;
generate local resources for forest investments outside the project (para. 3.7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Albania Foreatry Project                  Page -20 -                       Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
above) and adjust DGFP's budgeting and accounting processes for future self-&#13;
financing. The purpose of the DGFP reorganization is to prepare the forest&#13;
administration for its future role and division into an autonomous Forest&#13;
Corporation (FC) and a remaining forestry and pasture department (FD) in the&#13;
MAF (para. 3.3 above).  Support provided under the project would include&#13;
office, transportation and communications equipment for DGFP headquarters,&#13;
and related incremental operating expenditure;&#13;
(b)    Support for Training, Education and Research in Forestry and Pastures&#13;
($0.7 million base cost) [For details see Annex F of the Supporting Volume]:&#13;
(i) In-service training for forestry and pasture staff at senior and mid-levels&#13;
would be provided through project-financed service contracts, mainly with the&#13;
Forest Faculty at the Agricultural University of Tirana ($0.05 million). In&#13;
addition, provision would be made for other local and foreign training&#13;
($0.18 million). (ii) Education for forestry technicians would be supported by&#13;
funding courses, equipment, and training of trainers at the Forest Technician&#13;
School at Shkoder ($0.07 million). (iii) Forestry and pasture research capacity&#13;
would be strengthened through upgrading the facilities and funding of foreign&#13;
training of staff of the Forest and Pasture Research Institute ($0.4 million);&#13;
(c)    Project Management ($0.6 million base cost) [For details see Annex G of the&#13;
Supporting Volume]. A temporary Project Management Unit (PMU) would be&#13;
responsible to plan, coordinate, manage, fund and monitor all project activities&#13;
in accordance with work programs and budgets approved by the Project Steering&#13;
Committee (para. 3.8 above);&#13;
(d)    Project Environmental Management ($0.2 million base cost) [For details see&#13;
Annex G of the Supporting Volume]. A Project Environmental Management&#13;
Unit (PEMU) would be established within the Agricultural Program Office of&#13;
MAF to ensure that project implementation is environmentally sound and to&#13;
promote conservation of nature in forests (para. 3.6 above and 4.1 (c) below).&#13;
The Head of PEMU would be a member of the Project Steering Committee and&#13;
supported by local and international consultants, training, transport equipment&#13;
and operating funds. In addition, technical assistance and training would also be&#13;
provided to the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP) to strengthen its&#13;
capacity to prepare guidelines for environmental monitoring and environmental&#13;
impact assessments of the sector; and&#13;
(e)    Technical Assistance ($2.95 million total cost) [For details see Annex G of the&#13;
Supporting Volumel. Technical assistance (TA) would be provided, in addition&#13;
to some PPF-funded TA, from two grant resources: (i) the Government of&#13;
Switzerland ($0.45 million total cost) to support the communal forest and pasture&#13;
and protected areas management components during year 1-3 of the project. This&#13;
TA would be implemented by PMU; and (ii) the Government of Italy under a&#13;
FAO-Government Cooperation Project ($2.5 million total cost) to support project&#13;
management, policy reforms and institutional development, and provide expert&#13;
advice and training under all components except communal forest and protected&#13;
areas management.&#13;
&#13;

Albania Fomstiy Prject                     Page -21 -                        Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
(2)    Improved State Forest Management ($8.1 million base cost) [For details see Annex B of&#13;
the Supporting Volume]. Project activities under this component are aimed at curbing&#13;
the ongoing degradation of Albanian State forests that will remain under the management&#13;
authority of DGFP and subsequently the Forest Corporation. These forests cover some&#13;
800,000 ha, or 70 percent of Albanian total forest cover, and include all high forests and&#13;
a significant share of coppice and shrubs. Project supported activities would include:&#13;
(a)    strengthening of forest management and conservation capacity of DGFP's field&#13;
offices to efficiently manage and protect State forests by providing 194 Sectors,&#13;
32 Districts, and 12 new "Technical Units" to be established at the Prefecture&#13;
level with improved offices and office, transportation and communications&#13;
equipment and funding of related incremental operating costs. It would also&#13;
include implementation of the action plan to reduce illegal forest harvesting&#13;
($3.3 million base cost);&#13;
(b)    resuming forest management planning by developing new, improved forest&#13;
management plans for 57 management units, or 160,000 ha of high forests, and&#13;
updating the simplified management plans for coppice and shrub forests. Both&#13;
types of forest management plans would be based on new guidelines that would&#13;
take account of non-wood economic aspects, including the forest's ecological and&#13;
social functions, and of a participatory approach ($1.3 million base cost);&#13;
(c)    reforestation  of sensitive  areas by  supporting  artificial complementary&#13;
regeneration (or reforestation by plantation or direct seeding) in areas of high&#13;
forests that: (i) have been harvested and where the natural regeneration has&#13;
partially or totally failed; and (ii) are located on highly erosive soils (i.e., clay&#13;
soils on steep slopes). DGFP would carry out a study of the high forest areas&#13;
with failed regeneration to identify those locations where reforestation is expected&#13;
to generate sufficient environmental benefits to make reforestation with&#13;
indigenous species economically viable. Reforestation activities would be agreed&#13;
with IDA during the review of the annual project work program and budget&#13;
(para. 4.5), and would be carried out on about 1,000 ha ($0.9 million base cost);&#13;
(d)    pre-commercial thinnings on about 29,000 ha of young stands of black pine,&#13;
beech, and oak, which is the total area of young stands of these species, 15 to&#13;
20 years of age, that need this silvicultural treatment ($2.1 million base cost);&#13;
and&#13;
(e)    forest protection by funding research and monitoring activities inter alia on the&#13;
processionary moth. This activity would be contracted to the Forest and Pasture&#13;
Research Institute ($0.5 million base cost).&#13;
(3)    Forest Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance ($2.4 million base cost) [For details see&#13;
Annex C of the Supporting Volume]. The project would support the rehabilitation of&#13;
about 350 km of existing forest roads in 53 selected forest management units in 16&#13;
districts which would be consistent with the units where new forest management plans&#13;
would be developed. The rehabilitation works would include levelling the bearing&#13;
course, rehabilitating the gravel bed, digging roadside ditches and reconstructing culverts&#13;
and other minor structures where necessary. Project resources would fund the design,&#13;
the implementation of rehabilitation works, and the maintenance of rehabilitated roads.&#13;
&#13;

Albania Forestry Project                  Page -22 -                        Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
The rehabilitation and maintenance works would be contracted to new private civil works&#13;
enterprises.&#13;
(4)    Management of Communal Forest and Pasture Areas ($2.2 million base cost) [For details&#13;
see Annex D of the Supporting Volumel. The Project would support participative&#13;
management of forests and pastures in 30 communes, involving:&#13;
(a)    implementation of a pilot project in three selected communes in Central Albania,&#13;
with funding provided under a Project Preparation Facility;&#13;
(b)    development of improved management and investment plans for areas of State&#13;
forests and pastures that would be transferred to communes, using a participatory&#13;
approach;&#13;
(c)    funding of selected communal investment projects in restoration of degraded&#13;
areas and pasture improvement, planting of fodder and fuel wood trees, and&#13;
fencing for protection and rehabilitation of highly degraded coppice and shrub&#13;
forests; and&#13;
(d)    establishment of a data base on communally managed forests and pastures, and&#13;
preparation of studies on the production and marketing potential for non-timber&#13;
forest products.&#13;
(5)    Protected Areas Management ($0.4 million base cost) [For details see Annex E of the&#13;
Supporting Volume]. This component would be implemented as a pilot operation over&#13;
a three-year period and would involve:&#13;
(a)    strengthening of protected areas management services in five priority districts,&#13;
by funding transport and communications equipment, staff training, and the&#13;
preparation of management plans for biodiversity protection; and&#13;
(b)    preparation and implementation of a protected areas pilot project for the Lura&#13;
National Park.&#13;
C. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING [See also Appendix 6, and Annex L of the Supporting Volume]&#13;
3.13   Total Project Cost. The Forestry Project is expected to cost US$21.6 million (Lek 2.1 billion)&#13;
over six years, including a PPF-funded pre-project phase. The foreign exchange component is estimated&#13;
at US$9.4 million, or about 43 percent of total project costs. Taxes and duties amount to U$1.6 million&#13;
of total project costs (9 percent of base costs). The estimated project costs are summarized in Tables 3.1&#13;
and 3.2 below.&#13;

3.15   Project Financing.&#13;
(a)    IDA.  Of the total project cost of US$21.6 million, the proposed IDA credit would finance&#13;
US$8.0 million (37 percent of total costs). IDA funds would be used to finance: (i) the PPF&#13;
expenditures for equipment, technical assistance, and training; (ii) most of the forest roads&#13;
component and the protected areas management component; (iii) part of the institutional&#13;
strengthening component, the state forest management component, and the communal forest and&#13;
pasture management component; and (iv) project recurrent costs (on a declining basis).&#13;
(b)    Government of Italy. The Government of Italy would finance a total of US$11.0 million (51&#13;
percent of total costs)-an untied soft loan of US$8.5 million would cofinance the institutional&#13;
strengthening component, the state forest management component, and the communal forest and&#13;
pastuire management component; and a grant of $2.5 million equivalent would finance technical&#13;
assistance by FAO under the institutional strengthening component.&#13;
(c)    Government of Switzerland.  The Government of Switzerland would provide a grant of&#13;
US$0.45 million equivalent for additional technical assistance under the institutional strengthening&#13;
component.&#13;
(d)    Governmentof Albania. The Government of Albania would contribute local counterpart financing&#13;
of about US$2.1 million equivalent (10 percent of total costs), which is sufficient to cover the&#13;
duties and taxes expected to be paid under the project and the agreed local share of recurrent cost&#13;
financing. The financing plan is shown, in Table 3.3 below.&#13;

D. FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY [See also Annex J of the Supporting Volume]&#13;
3.17   The forestry/pasture sector in the last years has been a drain on the Government's budget (para.&#13;
2.42). The policy reforms, institutional strengthening and initial investments supported under the project&#13;
are expected to turn the situation around and generate increased revenues from forestry and pasture&#13;
operations.  A conservative estimate, based on income from  timber and fuelwood revenues only,7&#13;
indicates that (i) the forestry sector's overall balance of total public income and expenditures could turn&#13;
positive by 1998; (ii) the Treasury contribution to funding of DGFP's operating expenditure in the&#13;
interim period would still be higher than the income Treasury will receive under the Revenue Account&#13;
mechanism; however, the negative balance would decline over the period; and (iii) sector financial&#13;
conditions could allow self-financing of a Forest Corporation from 1999 onwards. Treasury net income&#13;
from forestry (the Corporation's forest royalties and taxes less continued budgetary support for the new&#13;
Forest and Pasture Department), will sharply increase once the Corporation is operating on the basis of&#13;
its own revenues without further budgetary support, except for project investments. In the longer term,&#13;
assuming an annual allowable cut of 0.6 million m3 of industrial timber at an average price of $34 (i.e.,&#13;
85 percent of the 1994 average stumpage price in Central Europe, or 2.6 times the 1994 price in&#13;
Albania), potential annual gross proceeds on the order of $20 million could be expected over time from&#13;
timber sales alone. 30-50 percent of this would accrue to Treasury from the Corporation's payments of&#13;
royalties, dividends and profit taxes, making the forestry sector a major net contributor to the&#13;
Government's budget, even if taking into account future budget expenditures for non-commercial activities&#13;
of the FD and payments of interest/service charges and principal on the Italian soft loan and IDA credit&#13;
for the project.&#13;
E. PROJECT PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
3.18   Procurement under the project would be carried out in accordance with World Bank guidelines&#13;
(Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, January 1995). To simplify project implementation,&#13;
items financed by the Italian Government loan would be procured using IDA guidelines. An indicative&#13;
Project Procurement Plan, indicating the main procurement packages financed under the project by all&#13;
financiers, is shown in Appendix 7. Specific procurement methods to be used for items financed by the&#13;
IDA credit are described below.&#13;
3.19   Civil Works: Forest Road Rehabilitation. Contracts for the rehabilitation and maintenance of&#13;
forest roads would be procured using special procedures acceptable to IDA. During negotiations of the&#13;
credit. it was agreed that forest road rehabilitation would be procured using lumpsum, fixed price&#13;
contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from three or more qualified domestic contractors&#13;
and using either (i) Bank-approved sample contract documentation for small works procurement (normally&#13;
used for contracts up to US$50,000) or (ii) the Bank's simplified bidding documents for small works,&#13;
which were prepared for Albania (available on diskette in Albanian and English). Out of a total cost of&#13;
US$2.2 million (including contingencies), IDA would finance an aggregate contract volume of&#13;
US$1.9 million, which would represent an estimated 35 contracts ranging from US$20,00 to US$100,000&#13;
per contract. Because of the small size of these contacts and the localized and highly scattered nature of&#13;
the works (53 forest management units in 16 districts), international firms are unlikely to be interested&#13;
7 Timber sales are projected to increase from 150,000 m3 at $13 per m3 in 1995 to 425,000 m3 at $30 per m3 in 1999, while&#13;
fuel wood production and prices are projected to remain at the 1995 levels; DGFP operating expenditure (without the project) is&#13;
projected to increasc from $2.95 million in 1995 to $4.3 million in 1998; and local investments (without the project) would increase&#13;
from $0.3 million in 1995 to $2.4 million in 1998 under the Revenue Account mechanism Ifor details see Annex J, Appendixl.&#13;

in these contracts. In the event that contract value exceeds $100,000, National Competitive Bidding&#13;
procedures would be applied using the Bank's model documents of September 1995.&#13;
3.20   Civil Works: Ofrice Buildings. Contracts for the construction and/or rehabilitation of district&#13;
and sector DGFP offices, PMU office, and PEMU office are estimated at the aggregate amount of&#13;
US$0.6 million. Out of this aggregate amount, IDA would finance an aggregate contract volume of&#13;
US$0.1 million equivalent (including contingencies), which would be procured using special procedures&#13;
acceptable to IDA.  During negotiations of the credit, it was agreed that civil works for office&#13;
construction or rehabilitation would be procured using lumpsum, fixed price contracts awarded on the&#13;
basis of quotations obtained from three or more qualified domestic contractors and using either (i) Bank-&#13;
approved sample contract documentation for small works procurement (normally used for contracts up&#13;
to US$50,000) or (ii) the Bank's simplified bidding documents for small works, which were prepared for&#13;
Albania (available on diskette in Albanian and English). When possible, the works would be grouped.&#13;
However, given the wide geographic disparity of the 10 district offices (including 5 for protected areas&#13;
management) and 90 sector offices to be constructed/rehabilitated, the contracts are not expected to&#13;
exceed US$40,000 each.&#13;
3.21   Forest Works, Forest Reforestation and Pre-Commercial Thinning. The reforestation of&#13;
degraded forests and the thinning of young forests, for an aggregate amount estimated at US$3.8 million,&#13;
of which an aggregate amount estimated at US$1.3 million would be financed by IDA, would be carried&#13;
out as follows:&#13;
(I)    Reforestation (aggregate amount estimated at US$0.4 million):&#13;
(a)    Reforestation is expected to be carried out in scattered areas where reforestation&#13;
can produce high environmental benefits. An estimated 10 contracts, which are&#13;
expected to range from US$20,000 to US$50,000 per contract, would be&#13;
procured using special procedures acceptable to IDA (aggregate amount US$0.3&#13;
million). It was agreed during negotiations that forest works would be procured&#13;
using lumpsum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained&#13;
from three or more qualified domestic contractors and using either (i) Bank-&#13;
approved sample contract documentation for small works procurement (normally&#13;
used for contracts up to US$50,000), or (ii) the Bank's simplified bidding&#13;
documents for small works, which were prepared for Albania (available on&#13;
diskette in Albanian and English).&#13;
(b)    Reforestation of beech by direct seeding, where natural regeneration has failed,&#13;
would be carried out by Force Account (aggregate amount estimated at&#13;
US$0. I million), because of specialized expertise available only within DGFP.&#13;
(2)    Pre-Commercial Thinning (aggregate amount estimated at US$0.8 million):&#13;
(a)    An estimated 22 contracts, expected to range between US$20,000 to US$50,000&#13;
each, would be awarded for pre-commercial thinnings on the basis of special&#13;
procedures acceptable to IDA, using the same procedures as described for&#13;
reforestation under (1)(a) above.&#13;
(3)    In the event that any of the contracts for reforestation and pre-commercial thinning&#13;
exceeds US$100,000 equivalent, NCB procedures would be applied using the Bank's&#13;
model bidding documents dated September 1995.&#13;

3.22   Forest Works, Communal Forest and Pasture Management Activities. Communal silvo-&#13;
pastoral improvement activities, for an aggregate amount not expected to exceed US$2.4 million, of&#13;
which US$0.9 million would be financed by IDA, would be carried out by local communities using&#13;
community-participation procurement procedures acceptable to IDA. These procedures were used with&#13;
good results under the IDA-supported Rural Poverty Alleviation Pilot Project (Cr. 2461-AL). Under&#13;
these procedures, contracts will be signed with communes for forest and pasture management activities;&#13;
communes will directly hire villagers to undertake manual labor, and will use National Shopping&#13;
procedures acceptable to IDA to procure small goods or transport. Individual contracts to be carried out&#13;
by local communities are not expected to exceed US$40,000 each.&#13;
3.23   Vehicles.  Contracts for 4-wheel drive vehicles, cars, and a bus, for an aggregate amount&#13;
estimated at US$1.2 million, of which US$0.3 million would be financed by IDA, would be awarded&#13;
through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures, in accordance with World Bank Guidelines.8&#13;
Domestic bidders would be granted a margin of preference as per IDA guidelines. Contracts for&#13;
motorcycles, for an aggregate amount estimated at 0.3 million, of which US$0.06 million would be&#13;
financed by IDA, would be awarded on the basis of International Shopping (IS), by soliciting at least&#13;
three quotations from suppliers in at least two eligible countries. The main procurement packages for&#13;
vehicles financed under the project are provided in Appendix 7.&#13;
3.24   Equipment, and Furniture.  Contracts for computer equipment, for an aggregate amount&#13;
estimated at US$0.4 million, of which IDA would finance an estimated US$0.1 million, would be&#13;
awarded on the basis of ICB. Domestic bidders would be granted a margin of preference as per IDA&#13;
guidelines. Contracts for office equipment, radio equipment, field equipment, and furniture, for an&#13;
aggregate amount estimated at US$0.7 million, of which IDA would finance US$0.3 million, would be&#13;
awarded on the basis of IS. Individual contracts awarded under IS are not expected to exceed&#13;
US$200,000. Small contracts below US$50,000 each for computers, equipment, materials, and horses,&#13;
for an aggregate amount estimated at US$0.1 million, of which IDA would finance an estimated US$0.04&#13;
million, would be awarded on the basis of NS. The main procurement packages for equipment financed&#13;
under the project are provided in Appendix 7.&#13;
' Vehicles funanced under the Project Prparation Facility were procured by increasing the number of units procured by ICB&#13;
for the IDA-frnced Tax Administration Project.&#13;

3.25   Technical Assistance; Training, Research and Studies; Management Plans.  Technical&#13;
assistance, training, research and studies, and management plans to be financed under the project are&#13;
estimated at US$6.3 million.&#13;
(a)    Technical assistance (TA) is estimated to cost a total of US$3.3 million. [For details see&#13;
Annex G of the Supporting Volume]. The Government of Italy would finance the&#13;
majority of TA with a US$2.5 million grant to be administered by FAO. The&#13;
Government of Switzerland would provide a grant of US$450,000 for TA. The&#13;
remaining TA (US$0.3 million), of which IDA would finance an aggregate amount&#13;
estimated at US$0.1 million, would be procured in accordance with IDA Guidelines for&#13;
the Use of Consultants. IDA-financed TA comprises about 6 mm of foreign experts&#13;
(I mm under the PPF; 5 mm for mid-term review), and local consultants for management&#13;
plan preparation under the Communal Forestry component and public awareness and&#13;
tourism promotion under the Protected Areas Management component.&#13;
(b)    The project also finances training, research, and studies for an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$1.3 million, of which IDA would finance an aggregate amount estimated at US$0.4&#13;

3.32   Special Account. To facilitate timely project implementation, the Government of Albania would&#13;
establish, maintain, and operate, under conditions acceptable to IDA, a Special Account denominated in&#13;
US dollars in the Bank of Albania. During the early stage of the project, the initial allocation of the&#13;
Special Account would be limited to US$250,000. However, when the aggregate disbursements under&#13;
the Credit have reached the level of SDR 680,000 (US$1.0 million), the initial allocation may be&#13;
increased up to the authorized allocation of US$500,000 by submitting the relevant Application for&#13;
Withdrawal. Replenishment applications should be submitted at least every three months, and must&#13;
include reconciled bank statements as well as other appropriate supporting documents.&#13;

G. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT [See also Annex K of the Supporting Volume]&#13;
3.33   The project as a forestry operation has been assigned to the environmental "A" category, in line&#13;
with the Bank's Forestry Policy. Based on the findings and recommendations of the Ecological Survey,9&#13;
the originally proposed construction of new forest access roads to open up new areas for timber&#13;
harvesting was eliminated from the project, and harvesting operations were limited to areas with existing&#13;
access that do not classify as present or future protected areas.&#13;
3.34   A full Environmental Assessment (EA) was carried out by the Government with assistance from&#13;
a FAO/CP team of local and international consultants, in parallel with project appraisal and post-appraisal&#13;
by IDA and the cofinancing agencies. Public hearings were held in October 1995. On January 17, 1996&#13;
the Government approved in principle the Ecological Survey and the EA report.'" During negotiations&#13;
of the credit, agreement was reached on the details of the mitigation and monitoring plan proposed in the&#13;
EA report that would be implemented under the project (See Appendix 8). Annex K of the Supporting&#13;
Volume contains the following excerpts from the original EA report: the summary, the table of issues&#13;
and impacts of the project, and the full mitigation and monitoring matrix.&#13;
3.35   All major additional findings and recommendations of the Ecological Survey and the EA have&#13;
been incorporated in the project design and funding: (i) the addition of a protected areas management&#13;
component, including the development of a management plan for one existing national park (para.&#13;
3.12 (5)); (ii) the establishment and operation of a Project Environmental Management Unit (PEMU),&#13;
separate from project implementing agencies and the project management unit, but with its head being&#13;
a member of the Project Steering Committee; PEMU would inter alia would be responsible for managing&#13;
the implementation of the mitigating measures (para. 3.6); (iii) the expansion of skill development in&#13;
environmental matters through training, provision of expert advice and twinning with a suitable&#13;
counterpart agency abroad for all agencies in Albania concerned with forest ecosystems (CEP, PEMU,&#13;
academic and research institutes) (paras. 3.6 and 4.1 (c)); and (iv) the use of the Forest and Sector&#13;
Strategy Review to involve local specialists and public participation and improve the environment for&#13;
multiple-use and sustainable forestry (para. 4.9).&#13;
3.36   The remaining main mitigating measures and monitoring actions to ensure environmentally sound&#13;
project implementation include (for minor measures and further details see Appendix 8):&#13;
(a)    The implementation of DGFP's Action Plan to Reduce Illegal Forest Harvesting would&#13;
be monitored by an independent third party, such as PEMU. Furthermnore, forest&#13;
products trade would not liberalized prior to the Bank's acceptance of successful results&#13;
of the Plan and the updating of the AAC (see also paras. 3.9, 3.11, 4.9 and 4.12);&#13;
(b)    PEMU's capacity would be developed to assume a lead role in etivironmental&#13;
management of the project. PEMU's responsibilities would include: preparation of&#13;
guidelines for environmental impact assessments (EIA) in forestry; provision of support&#13;
to DGFP for the preparation of best management practices for road rehabilitation;&#13;
preparation for approval by CEP of EIA for individual forest management plans&#13;

FORESTRY PROJECT&#13;
CHAPrER IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. RESPONSIBiLmES AND MANAGEMENT (see also Annex G of the Supporting Volume)&#13;
4.1    The Ministry ofAgriculture and Food (MAF) would be responsible for the overall implementation&#13;
and coordination of the project, including its institutional and policy reforms. To ensure focus, efficiency&#13;
and accountability in a situation with major institutional reforms evolving under the project, temporary&#13;
management mechanisms would be established which include a high-level Project Steering Committee and&#13;
a Project Management Unit (PMU) reporting to that Steering Committee. New permanent structures for&#13;
management of certain aspects of the forestry/pasture sector include a Project Environmental Management&#13;
Unit (PEMU) and a new forest and pasture department as line agency in the Ministry once DGFP has&#13;
been transformed into a Forest Corporation. These new structures are also expected to adjust their scope&#13;
and responsibilities over time. DGFP shall remain the major project implementing agency within the&#13;
MAF until the Corporation is established. Specific responsibilities of the various agencies would be as&#13;
follows:&#13;
(a)    The Project Steering Committee would be constituted by the Minister of Agriculture (or&#13;
his representative) as Chairperson, the Director of the Agricultural Program Office, the&#13;
Project Director, the head of PEMU, and the Director General of DGFP (to be replaced&#13;
later by both the Forest Corporation's Chief Executive and the Director of the new Forest&#13;
and Pasture Department). In addition, the Steering Committee will draw on the expertise&#13;
and recommendations from stakeholders in the forestry and pasture sector by including&#13;
as non-voting members representatives from the Ministry of Health and Environment,&#13;
Ministry of Construction and Tourism, local governments. private sector and non-&#13;
governmental organizations. The Steering Committee will be responsible for: the&#13;
approval of the annual project work program and budget prepared by PMU; quarterly&#13;
reviews of implementation and approval of budget adjustments proposed by PMU; overall&#13;
monitoring of project execution; and assistance in resolving evolving problems. The&#13;
Steering Committee would also decide about the allocation of local investment resources&#13;
provided under the Revenue Account mechanism, but outside the project.&#13;
(b)    The Project Management Unit (PMU) would consist of a Project Director (PD), four&#13;
technical specialists (institutional and legal, forester, economist, and procurement), an&#13;
accountant, secretary/translator and support staff who would all have long-term consultant&#13;
contracts. PMU would also be supported by a resident internationally recruited Advisor,&#13;
and technical specialists provided periodically under the technical assistance programs.&#13;
The PD would report directly to the Project Steering Committee." It was aereed during&#13;
negotiations of the credit that the terms of reference and the qualification and experience&#13;
of the PD would be acceptable to IDA. PMU will be responsible for: (i) preparing,&#13;
jointly with the project implementing agencies, project annual work programs and&#13;
budgets (para. 4.5 below) for approval by the Project Steering Committee, as well as of&#13;
I During the PPF-supported pre-project phase, the head of the PMU reported to the DG of DGFP.&#13;
&#13;

Albania Forestry Project                  Page -36 -                        Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
quarterly updates; (ii) managing, coordinating and monitoring the implementation of all&#13;
approved project work programs by the implementing agencies under contracts or&#13;
agreements between PMU and the implementing agencies; (iii) managing and&#13;
coordinating the technical assistance input and training; (iv) implementing or coordinating&#13;
procurement; (v) securing the timely provision of local and external project funding; (vi)&#13;
making payments to project implementing agencies in accordance with the contractual&#13;
arrangements;  (vii) keeping accounting records and ensuring audits of all project&#13;
expenditure; and (viii) reporting on project progress.&#13;
(c)    The Project Environmental Management Unit (PEMU) would be a new permanent unit&#13;
to be established as part of MAF's Agricultural Program Office (APO) in order to&#13;
maintain authority and avoid conflict of interest with project implementing agencies on&#13;
sensitive environmental matters. While PEMU would initially, within the framework of&#13;
the project, focus on the conservation of nature in the forest as its primary responsibility,&#13;
over time, it would expand the scope of its functions towards other environmentally&#13;
sensitive aspects of the activities and programs of the Ministry of Agriculture in line with&#13;
the Government's policy to establish an environmental management capability in each&#13;
sectoral ministry. Major tasks of PEMU would be to undertake directly, or commit&#13;
experts for environmental impact assessments, monitor progress in reducing illegal&#13;
harvesting, provide assistance for and check the implementation of environmental&#13;
mitigation and monitoring plan, establish and operate a data base for the sector, and&#13;
contribute to the development of a long-term forest and pasture strategy. PEMU would&#13;
be staffed with an Albanian expert (economy, biology or engineering) and support staff.&#13;
It would be supported by specialized international expertise provided under the TA&#13;
component including backstopping by an external scientific or forest management&#13;
institution to provide training and expert visits. Training would include not only PEMU&#13;
staff but other Albanian experts in CEP and DGFP. PEMU would mainly operate&#13;
through contractual arrangements that it would conclude with Albanian scientific,&#13;
academic and research institutions for the provision of specific experts, with payment&#13;
under the project. It was agreed during negotiations of the credit that the terms of&#13;
reference and the qualification and experience of the head of PEMU would be acceptable&#13;
to IDA.&#13;
(d)    The Directorate General of Forests and Pastures (DGFP) would be the main project&#13;
implementing agency within MAF that would both carry through and be affected by&#13;
institutional reforms of the forest administration, and that would be responsible for&#13;
carrying out the project's State forest management, forest roads rehabilitation, communal&#13;
forest and pasture management, and protected areas management components, under&#13;
contractual arrangements with PMU. DGFP would implement most of the activities&#13;
through its own functional and regional dependencies, but could also, in agreement with&#13;
PMU, contract specific services directly with specialized agencies, such as the&#13;
Agriculture University or the Forest and Pasture Research Institute, or private sector&#13;
enterprises, which it would supervise.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Albania Foratzy Project                  Page -37 -                        Staff Appraiaal Repoit&#13;
In addition to the APFDP supported Forest Policy Advisory Group, DGFP would&#13;
establish in its Pastures Section a new communal forest and pasture management&#13;
capability to implement the project's respective component. 12&#13;
DGFP would also prepare and implement, after approval by the Project Steering&#13;
Committee, the investment programs to be funded by the local resources generated under&#13;
the 'Revenue Account' mechanism, which would be complementary to project resources.&#13;
(e)    The Forest Corporation (FC), and a new Forest and Pasture Department in MAF would&#13;
evolve from the current DGFP, likely after the mid-term review of the project when most&#13;
of the distortions of prices and costs in the sector have been eliminated allowing&#13;
financially viable forest management, and when detailed institutional and business plans&#13;
have been developed for the DGFP successor organizations. It is also anticipated that FC&#13;
and the new forest line agency in MAF would assume the role and responsibilities for&#13;
project implementation that previously rested with DGFP. It is expected that DGFP's&#13;
activities in policy development and monitoring, regulatory control, communal forest and&#13;
pasture management, and protected areas management will be transferred to the new&#13;
Forest and Pasture Department, while the remaining commercially viable DGFP&#13;
functions, both with and without the project, will remain in the future FC.&#13;
4.2    Other project-relevant Government institutions in the forestry and pasture sector include:&#13;
(a)    Forest Technician School at Shkoder: Project support to strengthen the Technician&#13;
School through the acquisition of selected equipment and training of trainers would be&#13;
based upon the detailed preparation of proposals and cost estimate by the School for&#13;
vetting by the PMU and approval of funding by the Project Steering Committee. In&#13;
addition, following the completion of the human resources study, PMU would establish&#13;
contracts with the School for funding specific training courses.&#13;
(b)    Forest and Pasture Research Institute: Selected facilities and equipment of FPRI would&#13;
be upgraded and funds provided for foreign training of its staff. Decisions would be&#13;
made on the basis of detailed proposals and cost estimates prepared by the Institute for&#13;
vetting by the PMU, and approval of funding by the Project Steering Committee. Also,&#13;
the Institute's services could be contracted for the development of forest management&#13;
plans, the implementation of project related research work and project monitoring and&#13;
evaluation (para. 4.11). It was agreed during negotiation of the credit that the adoption&#13;
of regulations for new-style forest management planning methodology, acceptable to&#13;
IDA, would be a condition of disbursement for the preparation of forest management&#13;
plans in State forests.&#13;
4.3    Communes:  Communes are considered implementing agencies under the project.  The&#13;
participation of communes in the project-supported communal forest and pasture management program&#13;
would be based upon pre-selection by DGFP's communal forest and pasture unit, and the receipt of a&#13;
letter of intent from the communes together with the assessment of their socio-economic situation,&#13;
management capacity, and livestock, forestry and pasture situation. Selected communes would set up&#13;
their communal silvo-pastoral commission that would be the main interlocutor with the DGFP to plan and&#13;
12 During the PPF-supported pre-project phase preparation of the component and the imnplementation of the communal foreat&#13;
and paatum pilot project was done by PMU.&#13;

Albania Foreasy Project                 Page -38 -                      Staff Appmisl Report&#13;
implement the component.  These commissions would be responsible for carrying through the&#13;
participatory approach within their communes, employing contractors for the preparation and&#13;
implementation of management and investment plans for their forest and pasture areas, and managing the&#13;
communal reinvestment funds that would receive parts of the revenues generated under the program. The&#13;
commune's preparations and proposals would be reviewed by DGFP professionals in relation to their&#13;
technical and managerial feasibility, and economic and environmental soundness. Communal silvo-&#13;
pastoral projects, that are approved by DGFP would be included in the pipeline of projects proposed for&#13;
approval by the Project Steering Committee within the Annual Work Plans and Budgets. Upon transfer&#13;
to the communes of the usufruct rights for the State-owned forest and pasture land concerned, and&#13;
approval by the Steering Committee, DGFP through its district offices would enter into a three-year&#13;
contractual arrangement with the commune that would specify the scope, timing and cost of the&#13;
investment project and the procedures to be observed by both parties. DGFP would provide extension&#13;
services through commune-based forest/pasture technicians who would be reassigned within DGFP.&#13;
DGFP would also supervise contract implementation by a team of project paid silvo-pastoral inspectors.&#13;
The approval of the regulation, acceptable to IDA, for the transfer of State forest and pasture land to&#13;
communes will be a condition of disbursement for forest works under the communal forest and pasture&#13;
management component, excluding works financed under the pilot project with PPF funding.&#13;
Furthermore, it was aereed during negotiations of the credit, that PMU will not disburse for communal&#13;
investments unless the transfer of land to the commune had been effective and the "Agreement-Contract"&#13;
between DGFP and the participating commune had been signed in each case.&#13;
B. FINANCING MECHANISM&#13;
4.4   Funding Sources. The sources for project funding are: (i) the Ministry of Finance as (1)&#13;
borrower of the IDA credit and Italian soft loan, (2) recipient of the TA grant from the Government of&#13;
Switzerland, and (3) provider of the Government's own contribution; and (ii) FAO through its&#13;
Government Cooperation Project for the in-kind provision of technical assistance that is being funded&#13;
from the TA grant of the Government of Italy. All project funding channelled through the Ministry of&#13;
Finance will be fully budgeted and included in the Annual Public Investment Budget. The Project&#13;
Steering Committee will be the major tool for allocating project expenditure, and the Project Management&#13;
Unit (PMU) will be in charge for planning, executing, and accounting for, the approved budgets.&#13;
4.5    Annual Project Work Program and Budget. Project execution would be based on annual detailed&#13;
work programs and budgets that would be prepared by PMU based on guidelines from the Project&#13;
Steering Committee, reviewed by IDA and the cofinancing agencies, and approved by the Steering&#13;
Committee and the Treasury/Council of Ministers. Agreement was reached during negotiations of the&#13;
credit that (i) the draft work program and budget would be submitted to IDA no later than October 15&#13;
of each year; (ii) that only expenditures included in the approved work plan and budget, acceptable to&#13;
IDA, would be eligible for funding from project resources; and (iii) the quarterly updates and revisions&#13;
of the project work plan and budget would be acceptable to IDA.&#13;
4.6    Contracting.  Project cash and in-kind expenditure would be based on annual, renewable&#13;
agreements or contracts between PMU and the project implementing agencies, or on direct supply&#13;
contract by PMU with providers of goods and services. PMU's own budgetary expenditure would be&#13;
approved and monitored by the Project Steering Committee. Implementing agencies including the&#13;
communes can, within the limitations and conditions set by their global contract with PMU, enter into&#13;
sub-contracts with their specific providers of goods and services or with the beneficiaries of their project&#13;
activities. Project funding will allow both full financing of expenditures as well as cost-sharing with&#13;
public and private institutions having access to other funding sources. Recurrent operating costs of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
A1bania Porety Project                   Page -39 -                       Staff Appraisll Report&#13;
DGFP/Forest Corporation will be funded on a declining basis to enhance sustainability by early&#13;
incorporation of such funding into their locally funded budgets. Non-contract project expenditure made&#13;
by the implementing agencies, including by PMU, would be reimbursed by PMU on the basis of&#13;
Statements of Expenditure that would be consistent with the annual budget and quarterly updates and&#13;
signed off by the Chief Executive or Chief Financial Officer of the implementing agency. Funding of&#13;
investments in communal forest and pasture improvement would be limited to a three-year period per&#13;
commune, and funding of the protected areas development component would be limited to the first three&#13;
years of the project.&#13;
4.7    The 'Revenue Account' mechanism would, during the interim period and until the establishment&#13;
of FC, operate in parallel to the project and would complement the resources and investments provided&#13;
under the project. This mechanism would replace the customary investment budget of DGFP from 1997&#13;
onwards, when the accumulated Revenue Account resources would become available for investment. The&#13;
allocation of the Revenue Account resources would be the responsibility of the Project Steering&#13;
Committee, and DGFP would be in charge to implement the approved investment program. This&#13;
mechanism would be a pre-cursor to the envisaged self-financing mechanism of the future FC, and help&#13;
improve DGFP's budgeting and accounting processes as well as the motivation and incentives for DGFP&#13;
staff who will now see the link between their revenues from forest sales and the amount of investment&#13;
DGFP can undertake the following year. In view of the need to closely coordinate the DGFP investment&#13;
programs funded under the project and under the Revenue Account, it was agreed during negotiations of&#13;
the credit that IDA and the Government would annually, before budget finalization, exchange views on&#13;
the investment program funded under the local "Revenue Account."&#13;
C. TECHICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING&#13;
4.8    Technical Assistance [See also Annex G of the Supporting Volume]. Technical Assistance would&#13;
be provided under the project for a wide range of specific expertise by internationally recruited&#13;
consultants for technical, managerial, financial and research activities. It would also include twinning&#13;
and back-stopping by an external specialized institution (for environmental management). TA would be&#13;
funded from an Italian Government Grant and administered by FAO under a FAO-Government&#13;
Cooperation Project, and from a Swiss Government Grant and administered by PMU. Local coordination&#13;
of TA would be the responsibility of PMU which would include the provision of all TA in the annual&#13;
work programs and budgets, and also in the agreements and contracts PMU will conclude with the project&#13;
implementing agencies, where a secondment of TA is appropriate. Under the project, all TA resources&#13;
have initially been budgeted as provision of external expertise. Albanian experts would be eligible for&#13;
recruitment as local consultants where their qualification and experience is competitive with international&#13;
candidates. In such cases, the terms of employment of Albanian consultants would be guided by the&#13;
specific requirements of the funding agencies. Furthermore, TA resources can, after review and&#13;
agreement between the Project Steering Committee and the external financing and cofinancing agencies,&#13;
be converted into external training of Albanian staff in case savings occur by agreed reductions of the&#13;
external consultant input, or by replacing expatriate consultants with competent and experienced Albanian&#13;
personnel.  It was agreed durine negotiations of the credit that the terms of reference and the&#13;
qualifications and experience of the following TA assignments would be acceptable to IDA: (i) the full-&#13;
time advisor to the Project Director (para. 4.1 (b)); (ii) the scientific or forest management institution&#13;
that would provide back-stopping to PEMU (para. 4.1 (c)); and (iii) the forestry policy specialist who&#13;
would coordinate the preparation of the forest and pasture sector strategy (para. 4.9 below).&#13;
4.9   Sector Strategy Reiew [For terms of reference see Annex G, Appendix 4 of the Supporting&#13;
Volume]. TA resources would also be used to prepare, during year one and two of the project,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Albania Fomstry Project                   Page -40 -                        Staff Appraisl Repoit&#13;
alternative options for the long-term development of Albania's forest and pasture sector. The review&#13;
would be aimed at identifying constraints to sustainable and environmentally sound management of the&#13;
sector and proposing an action program for overcoming the identified constraints. This program should&#13;
include legal, institutional, macro-policy, financial, economic, environmental and technical measures as&#13;
relevant for the sector, both at the production and the processing level. Particular attention during the&#13;
review should be given to: (i) the legal and institutional base for effective environmental management;&#13;
(ii) the updating of the annual allowable cut (AAC); (iii) commercial operations, including the structure&#13;
and operations of the proposed Forest Corporation, potential forest concessions and opening up of new&#13;
harvesting areas; (iv) the institutional and funding arrangements for protected areas and national parks;&#13;
(v) communal and private sector forest and pasture management, including land ownership issues; and&#13;
(vi) economic viability and funding of afforestation, reforestation, soil conservation and other programs&#13;
of improved management of renewable natural resources. The Review would prepare specific proposals&#13;
to update and refine the existing Forestry Law, to finalize the National Biodiversity Strategy and to revise&#13;
the draft Law on the Protection of Nature and Biological Diversity. The review process would involve&#13;
high-level Albanian policy makers and would seek to create a national consensus on the long-term vision&#13;
for the sector using a conference or workshop/seminar format. These activities would be carried out&#13;
prior to the project's Mid-term Review (para. 4.12) so as to provide an input for possible adjustments&#13;
of the project design and legal framework for the project's second half, generate actions to improve the&#13;
conditions of the sector, and identify desirable new project interventions.  It was agreed during&#13;
negotiations of the credit that (i) the Sector Strategy Review documents would be prepared by June 30,&#13;
1997; (ii) public workshops/seminars would be held, and a study and recommendations would be prepared&#13;
by June 30, 1998; (iii) proposals for amending the Forestry Law and the draft law on the protection of&#13;
nature and biological diversity would be reviewed with IDA no later than April 30, 1999; and (iv) the&#13;
agreed proposal and draft law would be submitted to Parliament no later than June 30, 1999;&#13;
4.10   Training [See also Annex F of the Supporting Volume]. Training activities under the project&#13;
include: (i) local in-service training for DGFP staff at all levels to be provided mainly through one week-&#13;
courses at the Forest Faculty of the Agricultural University of Tirana; (ii) local training for a total of&#13;
18 Forest Technician School staff by a foreign "trainer of trainers" in three four-week courses; (iii)&#13;
foreign training and study tours for DGFP staff in a variety of subjects to improve specialist skills for&#13;
which training opportunities do not exist in Albania: timber marketing and pricing, new-style forest&#13;
management plans, and to expand international experience; (iv) short-term training and study tours for&#13;
staff of the FPRI to learn how forest research issues (such as sustainable forest management, conservation&#13;
of genetic resources, forest protection measures, forest harvesting and pasture management in mountain&#13;
areas) are being addressed in different countries and how approaches elsewhere may have applicability&#13;
to the Albanian situation; (v) long-term foreign training for one FPRI staff to study management and&#13;
monitoring of forest ecosystems; and (vi) on-the-job training by visiting foreign TA experts who each will&#13;
be assigned at least one local counterpart.&#13;
D. PROJECT MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
4.11   The Forest and Pasture Research Institute which is independent from project management and&#13;
DGFP, or another suitable agency, would be contracted by PMU to develop and implement a monitoring&#13;
and evaluation system for project activities. In order to be able to perform this task, FPRI or another&#13;
agency selected, would receive TA to set up the system and train assigned staff, and its staff would attend&#13;
an external training course on the subject of project monitoring and evaluation. A computerized system,&#13;
such as "Microsoft Project," would be used to plan and monitor project activities. The use of the system&#13;
and data would be shared with PMU that would use it as a management tool. Key performance indicators&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Albania Forvstry Poject                   Page -41 -                        Staff Appniusa Report&#13;
to measure the achievement of overall project objectives, the effectiveness of project management ar.d&#13;
institutional and policy reforms, and the realization of project physical targets is in Appendix 4.&#13;
4.12   It was agreed during negotiations of the credit that, before December 31, 1998, a Mid-Term&#13;
Project Progress Review would be carried out between the Government, IDA and the cofinancing&#13;
agencies. This Mid-Term Review will take account of the results of the prior Sector Strategy Review&#13;
(para. 4.9 above), assess project implementation progress to date, and agree on adjustments, if necessary,&#13;
of the project's scope, focus and implementation schedule. The Review would cover the following&#13;
particular areas:&#13;
(a)    Implementation progress and impact achieved through (i) policy adjustments (reduction&#13;
of illegal logging, liberalization of forest products trade, improved domestic marketing&#13;
and pricing), (ii) reforming and developing institutions of Albania's forest administration,&#13;
(iii) developing and introducing new-style forest management planning procedures,&#13;
(iv) planning of reforestation investments, taking account of their economic viability,&#13;
(v) initial projects in communal forest and pasture management, (vi) compliance with the&#13;
environmental mitigation and monitoring plan, and (vii) operation of the Revenue&#13;
Account mechanism; and&#13;
(b)    Development of strategies and detailed operational plans for the second half of the project&#13;
implementation period, including (i) building on consensus achieved on the resolution&#13;
of strategic issues in the Albanian forest and pasture sector, (ii) assessment of the&#13;
readiness of the Albanian forest institutions to move toward the creation of an&#13;
autonomous entity for commercial operations, (iii) detailed designs and operational plans&#13;
for the future Forest Corporation, (iv) draft documentation on a new law for the&#13;
protection of nature and biological diversity and on proposed amendments to the existing&#13;
forestry law; (v) involvement of stakeholders in the management of the sector, and&#13;
(vi) identification/preparation of a follow-on operation for biodiversity protection.&#13;
E. AUDITING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS&#13;
4.13   Separate auditable project accounts would be established in PMU for each of the three external&#13;
financing agencies and the local Government contribution in order to keep project expenditures&#13;
identifiable by funding source. The project accounts would be audited annually by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to IDA. Separate audit statements would be prepared for the Special Accounts and for&#13;
Statements of Expenditure. The Project Director, PMU, will prepare and furnish to IDA and the&#13;
cofinancing agencies, by December I of each year during the disbursement period, a forward looking&#13;
technical and financial project annual progress report in a format acceptable to IDA, and review with IDA&#13;
and the cofinancing agencies the conclusions and recommendations of this report, including the&#13;
forthcoming annual work program and budget of PMU and any measures that need to be taken during&#13;
the following year to ensure proper execution of the project. The submission to IDA and the cofinancing&#13;
agencies would also include the budget proposal for the Revenue Account investments by DGFP (or the&#13;
budget proposal of the future Forest Corporation) for the following year to facilitate the exchange of&#13;
views with IDA and the project cofinancing agencies on this parallel investment program (para. 4.7).&#13;
Assurances on these auditing and reporting requirements have been obtained during negotiations of the&#13;
credit.&#13;
4.14   A quarterly report on project progress and statements of project expenditures would be prepared&#13;
by the Project Director, PMU, and submitted to the Project Steering Committee members, the agency&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Albania Forety Project                   Page -42 -                       Staff Apprail Report&#13;
selected for monitoring and evaluation, and IDA and cofinancing agencies. Based on these quarterly&#13;
reports, the forward looking work plan and budget prepared by the Project Director, PMU, (para. 4.13&#13;
above), and its own findings and assessments, FPRI or another agency selected for monitoring and&#13;
evaluation would compile an annual report that would be submitted to the Government, and the&#13;
Government would submit the report to IDA and the cofinancing agencies by March 31 of each project&#13;
year. The agency in charge of monitoring and evaluation would also be responsible for preparing the&#13;
agenda and report for the Mid-Term Review and the Borrower's Project Evaluation Report. The latter&#13;
report, which would be due six months after the Project Completion Date, would form the basis of the&#13;
Implementation Completion Report that would be compiled by IDA.&#13;
F. IMPLEMENTATION AND SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
4.15   Implementation. Details on the implementation of the different components of the project are&#13;
in Appendix 3. An implementation plan produced by the Borrower is in Annex H of the Supporting&#13;
Volume.&#13;
4.16   Supervision. Since the project involves innovative components for Albania, including communal&#13;
forest/pasture and protected areas management, the transformation of a Government department towards&#13;
a market enterprise, and also environmentally sensitive activities such as timber harvesting and forest&#13;
roads rehabilitation, careful project supervision would be undertaken by IDA. The project would be&#13;
supervised by IDA Headquarters staff on an average of three times per year for an estimated total cost&#13;
of about 75 staff-weeks. In addition, about half of the time of one project officer in the Bank's Resident&#13;
Mission would be allocated to deal with problems and issues arising between Headquarter missions. In&#13;
the first year, however, one additional start-up mission would be necessary, including a start-up&#13;
workshop. A detailed supervision plan is given in Appendix 5.&#13;

CHAPTER V. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. PROJECT BENEFITS&#13;
5.1   In relation to the principal project objectives (para. 3. 1), the project's activities are expected to&#13;
generate the following benefits: (i) economic production benefits from restoring degraded forest and&#13;
pastures; (ii) direct and indirect environmental benefits from preventing losses from soil erosion,&#13;
enhancing biodiversity and ecosystems protection, and preservation of protected areas; and&#13;
(iii) institutional and policy improvements that are expected to lead to higher degrees of efficiency and&#13;
sustainability of use of a public renewable resource, with provisions to safeguard stakeholder interests&#13;
and the creation of positive externalities through continued, but more focused public sector involvement.&#13;
Key indicators for progress would be: control of illegal harvesting operations; application of new-style&#13;
forest management methodology that would be geared to multiple and sustainable forest use; annual total&#13;
timber harvests not exceeding the AAC of net effective productive areas; achievement of the sector's&#13;
financial viability which will depend on competitive marketing and trade liberalization; and creation of&#13;
an autonomous Forest Corporation to deal with commercial, efficient exploitation of the resource.&#13;
5.2    Economic production benefits would accrue to the project from  incremental investment in&#13;
restoring and maintaining the production potential of forests and pastures; and more effective planning&#13;
and management of its utilization. These benefits, in connection with the above institutional and policy&#13;
reforms, are expected to improve the long term viability of the forest and pasture sector and would&#13;
consist principally of:&#13;
(a)    Incremental wood productivity of State forests generated by the project through:&#13;
(i) improved control of illegal cutting through DGFP's strengthened field services; (ii)&#13;
halting degradation and improving management of existing forests, based on new forest&#13;
management plans for 160,000 ha; (iii) reforestation by direct seeding or plantation on&#13;
1,000 ha of high forest areas in areas with expected high environmental benefits (clay&#13;
soils on slopes), where no natural regeneration has been successfully established&#13;
previously; (iv) pre-commercial thinnings on 29,000 ha; and (v) forest pest monitoring;&#13;
(b)    Incremental wood productivity  of communally  managed forest areas through:&#13;
(i) reforestation of hilly/mountainous areas; and (ii) clear-cutting and temporary fencing&#13;
of degraded shrub and coppice land to improve regrowth, mainly for fuelwood;&#13;
(c)    Increased production and productivity offodderfor livestock from communally managed&#13;
forest and pasture areas through: (i) an increase of fodder yields of pasture land by&#13;
fertilization, re-seeding and temporary fencing; (ii) the addition of fodder trees in pasture&#13;
areas; (iii) the interplanting in shrub areas with fodder trees; (iv) the clearcutting and&#13;
temporary fencing of shrubs to increase fodder yields (in addition to stimulate growth of&#13;
fire wood -- see sub-para. (b) above). These increases in fodder availability will allow&#13;
better feeding of the existing animal stocks, expand livestock numbers where the carrying&#13;
capacity allows, and encourage change in the composition of livestock towards more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Albania Foresty Project                    Page 44 -                         Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
productive and less damaging types (such as replacement of goats by sheep and cattle).&#13;
These changes will result in increased milk and meat production for subsistence and&#13;
sales;&#13;
(d)    Incremental productivity of non-timber products through: (i) increased possibilities of&#13;
hunting and tourism activities in State forests; (ii) collection, processing and marketing&#13;
of medicinal plants, wild mushrooms, and berries from State forests; and (iii) the&#13;
development of secondary forest product production from communal areas including&#13;
aromatic, medicinal or cosmetic plants and mushroom cultures, as well as their local&#13;
processing; and&#13;
(e)    Savings in lost production and productivity. Thanks to the expected impact of the project&#13;
in curbing on-going degradation of forest and pastoral resources, additional economic&#13;
benefits would be generated by foregoing lost production and productivity in wood, non-&#13;
wood forest products, and fodder. Without the project, further degradation would have&#13;
resulted.&#13;
5.3    Environmental benefits would be generated under the project through:&#13;
(a)    Soil protection. All reforestation activities will take place in steep terrain where the risk&#13;
for erosion is high. By re-establishing forest cover, with environmentally friendly&#13;
methods, where most of the work is done manually, the risk of erosion is very much&#13;
reduced. If these areas were not reforested, the bare land would be very vulnerable to&#13;
erosion;&#13;
(b)    Water quality and retention. Continuous forest cover improves water quality and the&#13;
capacity of the land to retain water, which is a very important function in many of the&#13;
steep mountain areas of Albania;&#13;
(c)    Improved biodiversity of the forests.  The reforestation sub-component has a strong&#13;
element of improving the biodiversity of the state forests since the restoration of forest&#13;
ecosystems, especially in areas with failed regeneration, would improve the conditions&#13;
of the ground flora and create favorable habitats for wildlife;&#13;
(d)    Improved health of the forests. Improved management of forests in general, would&#13;
improve the general health situation of the forests and the resistance to pest attacks;&#13;
(e)    Enhanced preservation of protected areas and one National Park for their biodiversity and&#13;
other environmental values; and&#13;
(f)    Increased carbon absorption from faster tree growth and expansion of tree cover.&#13;
5.4    The institutional and policy development supported under the project would create an&#13;
administrative and policy framework for a more efficient and sustainable use of State-owned forest and&#13;
pasture assets, based on market values, competition, incentives, and environmental soundness. The project&#13;
would build the base for placing commercially viable operations in the sector under an autonomous&#13;
corporation and reorganizing the remaining functions of a public goods or general services character,&#13;
including that of environmental management, under one or several Government agencies with transparent,&#13;
full or partial, funding from the central budget.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Albania Foraiy PoJect                      Page 45 -                         Staff Appraiaal Report&#13;
5.5    The project is expected to lead to a reduction of government support by making the sector&#13;
financially viable and a net contributor to the government:&#13;
(a)    Liberalized trade, competitive marketing and pricing of timber, and efficiency&#13;
improvements in forest management will allow the timber production sector to move from&#13;
a situation of depressed prices and sales volumes, and fiscal transfers, towards financial&#13;
viability and generator of fiscal incomes;&#13;
(b)    Institutional restructuring will lead to reduction, transparency and higher efficiency in the&#13;
allocation of fiscal resources limiting them in principle to ensure the generation of&#13;
external benefits and the provision of public goods and services; and&#13;
(c)    Several components of the project will require significant amounts of unskilled labor and&#13;
thus contribute to generate employment opportunities in rural areas although this is not&#13;
one of the project's principal objectives. The investments that are to be made in&#13;
reforestation and pre-commercial thinnings, in particular, are labor intensive. These&#13;
activities would provide significant employment opportunities in rural areas over the&#13;
project period. The project would also contribute to fostering rural entrepreneurship and&#13;
maintaining economic activity in areas facing difficulties during Albania's period of&#13;
economic transition.&#13;
B. MARKETS AND PRICES&#13;
5.5   In the immediate pre-project situation of the mid-1990s, the sustainable and technically feasible&#13;
supply potential for industrial timber (annual allowable cut) exceeded the domestic demand, even taking&#13;
into account significant illegal logging. The low demand is largely caused by the breakdown of timber&#13;
processing industries during the transition from State-owned to private sector enterprises and by the&#13;
quantitative restrictions and current ban on timber exports. Demand for fuelwood has, for a long time,&#13;
exceeded the sustainable supply capacity due to a history of a subsidized and centrally administered&#13;
distribution system. While the fuelwood subsidy was officially eliminated in 1994, the sales price has still&#13;
been set by DGFP and not by market forces, and customary preferences are being accorded to villagers&#13;
for their local fuelwood supply. These issues are expected to be resolved over the next few years:&#13;
(a)    A number of joint ventures with foreign partners have been established in the timber&#13;
processing industry that are expected to improve capacity and technical efficiency;&#13;
(b)    an early action program to reduce illegal logging would be implemented under the&#13;
project;&#13;
(c)    as part of the project's policy reform agenda, timber exports would be liberalized once&#13;
control has been regained over illegal logging, allowing foreign sales of surplus timber&#13;
at world market prices which are substantially higher than corresponding domestic prices&#13;
before the project; and&#13;
(d)    the full liberalization of domestic fuelwood distribution and prices will tend to lift fuel&#13;
wood prices closer to the price of alternative fuels such as electricity or kerosene.&#13;
Furthermore, it can be expected that, regardless of price advantages of fuelwood, over&#13;
time more convenient and attractive energy sources would be preferred as the economy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Albania Forestry Project                      Page -46 -                            Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
develops and incomes rise. Legal sales of fuelwood have fallen to record lows in 1995&#13;
and 1996.&#13;
5.6    Forest production in Albania is largely geared towards serving the domestic demand. While beech&#13;
wood, due to its high quality, appears to have good potential for export sales, the volumes available are&#13;
uncertain as a result of the lack of volume assessments. However, the trade, pricing and marketing&#13;
reforms proposed under the project would contribute to open up foreign markets and apply competitive&#13;
pressures on forest production and processing enterprises that will all result in efficiency improvements.&#13;
Domestic prices will be determined by demand and supply, using competitive bidding and auctions of&#13;
standing timber as the main mechanisms. Over time domestic prices would thus adjust to their border&#13;
equivalents. This will clear the markets and no major obstacles are therefore foreseen in terms of&#13;
marketing the incremental wood production generated under the project's activities.&#13;
5.7    However, within this liberalized system  of trade, pricing and marketing of forest products,&#13;
interventions and regulations are needed in three principal aspects:&#13;
(a)    The total annual allowable cut for the productive areas that would be re-assessed under&#13;
the project and regularly updated must not be exceeded by the harvesting volume in any&#13;
one year to ensure sustainable forestry production;&#13;
(b)    harvesting must be done in accordance with new style forest management plans that&#13;
ensure a sound spatial balance of harvesting and provide for the application of the results&#13;
of environmental assessments for selecting the harvesting areas, the roads rehabilitation&#13;
works, and the harvesting technology; and&#13;
(c)    auction of timber by the producing agency must have a pre-determined minimum price,&#13;
below which sales would not take place since it could lead to 'mining" of the resource.&#13;
T.his minimum price should be composed of two elements: (i) a royalty (a fixed fee per&#13;
area or share of the minimum price) to be paid to the owner (the Albanian government)&#13;
in compensation for the use of national assets (timber land and natural or previously&#13;
planted forest) and the associated external benefits these assets generate; and (ii) the&#13;
discounted cost of replacing the timber harvested, to be paid to the agency responsible&#13;
for forest management.&#13;
C. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS Isee also Annex I for details]&#13;
5.8    Assumptions. The quantified financial and economic analysis of the project is based on: (i) the&#13;
incremental value of timber, fuelwood and fodder (meat and milk) produced through project-supported&#13;
technical interventions in Albanian high forests and in communal forests and pastures (thinning,&#13;
reforestation, forest road rehabilitation, fuelwood plantations, pasture improvement, and fodder trees);&#13;
(ii) the long-term loss of forest productivity caused by illegal logging which would be reduced by&#13;
institutional strengthening;t3 (iii) market prices for the financial costs and values that are linked to the&#13;
adoption of the policy and institutional reforms proposed under the project, including improved control&#13;
13 The economic benefits do not include the value of direct revenues foregone from uncollected stumpage fees (which affect&#13;
the cash flow of thc Government and are irrelevant for the economic valuation). They reflect future prcduction that will not be lost&#13;
as a result of reducing illegal logging (broken trees, unremoved logs, damage to regeneration). These losses are conservatively&#13;
estimated at $0.75 million per year over the forty years that the forest will need to recover naturally from the damage.&#13;

Albania Forestry Project                    Page 47 -                          Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
over illegal logging, competitive timber sales and liberalization of trade in forest products; and (iv) the&#13;
adjustment of financial values to arrive at economic values by (1) adding reduced soil erosion as an&#13;
environmental benefit of reforestation on clay soils on slopes; and (2) pricing of unskilled labor used in&#13;
all forest works by applying a factor of 0.3 during the project implementation years in view of the current&#13;
high rate of unemployment in the forest areas and the current low level of income available from&#13;
alternative jobs such as gathering of herbs. The financial and economic analysis does not include&#13;
additional benefits that would be obtained from non-timber products (medicinal and aromatic herbs), non-&#13;
extractive values other than soil erosion such as hunting, improved hydrological conditions and carbon&#13;
sequestration, and the preservation value of forests (biodiversity value). Reliable estimates of these values&#13;
are not available or highly speculative. The economic analysis is therefore conservative and likely&#13;
underestimates the total economic value of the project.&#13;
5.9    Results. The project is economically viable, both as a whole and by component (excluding the&#13;
protected areas management component, which being a pilot project has not been valuated). Details of&#13;
the economic analysis using "best estimates" of the technical and economic parameters, are given in Table&#13;
5.1 below. The project ERR, based on the aggregation of the individual component cost and net benefit&#13;
streams, is estimated at 49 percent including the large and high-return road rehabilitation component.&#13;
The very high returns from road rehabilitation is mainly due to the sunk cost of former road construction&#13;
which is being exploited with relatively small rehabilitation expenditure, and because all of the wood that&#13;
can be extracted is considered incremental. Excluding this road rehabilitation component, the ERR of&#13;
the project would be 16 percent. Commercial reforestation of beech and black pine yielded an economic&#13;
return of about 5 percent and failed to reach the threshold ERR level of 10 percent (opportunity cost of&#13;
capital). During the project appraisal process, reforestation with native species was therefore excluded&#13;
from project support, except for reforestation on highly erodible soils where the benefits from reduced&#13;
soil erosion lifted the returns to above 10 percent.&#13;
5.10   Sensitivity. (i) The results of the economic analysis of timber production in the high forests are&#13;
not sensitive against changes in costs and benefits. This is largely due to the very long term nature of&#13;
the production cycle (80-100 years). (ii) For communal forest and pasture investments, most of which&#13;
are maturing faster, in particular the pasture investments, the analysis results are more sensitive to&#13;
changes in costs and benefits. However, even if costs are increased by 20% and benefits decreased by&#13;
20%, these investments do not loose economic viability. (iii) The investment in forest thinning generates&#13;
a good economic return and remains viable over a relative wide range of changes of costs and benefits,&#13;
since it improves the benefits from an existing, poorly exploited resource, i.e., existing forest stands.&#13;
(iv) The investment in forest roads rehabilitation which shows very high returns under the basic&#13;
assumptions used, remains viable under practically all circumstances. This is due to the sunk cost&#13;
character of roads that were built earlier, the relative low investments needed for rehabilitation, and the&#13;
attribution of the net value of all wood extracted from those areas as incremental benefits. (v) The&#13;
benefits attributed to institutional development are based on the estimated value of the damages of illegal&#13;
logging that would be prevented through institutional strengthening. This estimate is not based on&#13;
detailed, comprehensive and reliable surveys but on observations of the affected areas and intensity of&#13;
such damages. The value of the timber extracted illegally is not included in the damage estimate since&#13;
this timber will not loose its economic value by being used outside the legal channels. The investments&#13;
to help controlling illegal harvesting are only part of the costs included under institutional development,&#13;
which cover for instance the costs of all technical assistance, project management, education, training and&#13;
research. The effectiveness of the measures to ensure efficient forest management, initially mainly&#13;
through the reduction of illegal logging, is the most sensitive element of the project's justification. This&#13;
reduction can only be achieved over time and with initial investments in equipment and training. Should&#13;
the reduction in illegal logging not be possible during the first half of the project period, the justification&#13;
for continuing with project investments would be lost.&#13;

D. RISKS&#13;
5.11    Project risks regarding technical aspects of forest management, road rehabilitation and communal&#13;
forest and pasture management are considered low. Albania possesses the basic expertise to deal with&#13;
technical aspects of forest use.  Safeguards are built into the project that require modern forest&#13;
management planning methodology, environmental assessment and mitigating procedures, and regulations&#13;
concerning transfer and use of communal forest and pasture areas are in place before disbursements for&#13;
investments in these activities are made.&#13;
5.12    The main risks of the project relate to uncertainties about the implementation of the institutional&#13;
and policy reforms. Critical elements are the following. First, the State must regain control over forest&#13;
management and exploitation. Albania's forest resource is characterized by public ownership, an&#13;
extremely long production cycle, and the generation of important, though not easily quantifiable,&#13;
environmental and other external benefits. Without effective protection and management of the forests&#13;
the benefits expected from investments in forest and road works cannot materialize. To this end, the&#13;
project focuses on the implementation of a monitorable action plan to reduce illegal logging and the early&#13;
strengthening of the administrative capacity through the provision of physical inputs and staff reorientation&#13;
and training. It will also include more effective involvement of a broader range of stakeholders and of&#13;
affected communes and populations. Second, and building on progress made in forest protection, is the&#13;
need to achieve financial viability and sustainability within the sector, at least for its commercial&#13;
operations. To this end, market-oriented procedures, both in domestic marketing and external trade,&#13;
would be introduced to help overcome the current under-use and under-valuation of the forest resource,&#13;
while at the same time ensuring technically and environmentally sound procedures of exploitation. Third,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Albania Forestry Project                   Page -49 -                         Staff Appraisal Report&#13;
and depending on progress made in achieving both technical and financial viability, is the need to improve&#13;
the technical and economic efficiency of forest and pasture operations. To this end, the project would&#13;
support the separation of commercial forest and pasture operations from regulatory and policy activities.&#13;
The former are expected to become the responsibility of a financially autonomous enterprise, the Forest&#13;
Corporation, and the latter services would remain within a line department of the Ministry of Agriculture.&#13;
5.13   At the start of the project, these three critical elements presenting major risks are not in place&#13;
since investment and time are required to build competence and implement these actions. The risk to&#13;
achieve the policy and institutional goals is mitigated by allowing a relative long adjustment and reform&#13;
period of up to three years. This first half of the project period would be used to build capacity for&#13;
dealing with the issues, achieve consensus within Albania about the longer term arrangements for use of&#13;
the forest and pasture resources, and refine concepts and planning for the policy, legal and institutional&#13;
actions. This process would be facilitated and smoothened by a proposed high-level seminar in year two&#13;
to review strategies proposed for the development of the sector, and the mid-term review of the project.&#13;
The latter would be used to assess progress made in resolving the above critical aspects and, depending&#13;
on the outcome and achievements, to confirm or adjust the design and scope of project activities, in&#13;
particular the more heavy forest and road rehabilitation investments, as well as communal investments,&#13;
planned for the second half of the project. Firmness in decision making as well as flexibility in project&#13;
implementation would be further enhanced by the high level of authority given to the institutional&#13;
arrangements for project management and the use of annual work programming, budgeting and&#13;
contracting procedures for project implementation activities.&#13;

Monitoring&#13;
Monitoring of the action plan to reduce illegal forest harvesting would deal with the following:&#13;
the implementation of the plan, by assessing actual implementation of the different activities listed&#13;
in the table above in the annual progress report;&#13;
the impact of the plan on illegal harvesting, by analyzing the annual reports from the Cadastral&#13;
District Units which are expected to document the following indicators:&#13;
-       number ot "offense reports" established by the District Forest Services for illegal&#13;
harvesting,&#13;
-       importance of the ot'enses measured by: number of illegally cut trees, volume cut&#13;
(extracted and remaining in the forest), area affected by illegal cutting;&#13;
-      legal suite for each offense: number of cases sent to the court, number of cases treated by&#13;
the court, number ol' cases punished, nature of the punishment.&#13;

            Albania - Forestry Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The three principal objectives of the
            Forestry Project are to: 1) restore degraded state-owned
            forest and pasture areas and promote their sustainable use;
            2) promote conservation of natural forest ecosystems; and 3)
            take the initial steps in the transition of the
            forestry/pasture sector to a market economy, separating
            commercial from regulatory functions and establishing
            mechanisms for self-financing of the commercial activities.
            The project will support institutional and policy reforms of
            Albania's forest and pasture sector and provide
            resources for investment in the following five main
            components: 1) institutional development of the
            forest/pasture administration including related training,
            education and research and the establishment of a project
            environmental management unit; 2) improved management of
            state forests; 3) rehabilitation of forest roads; 4)
            management of communal forest and pasture areas; and 5)
            management of protected areas.
