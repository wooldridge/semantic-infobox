1. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. COUNTRY BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1    Zambia is a country of about 750,000 square kilometers, roughly the area of Spain and&#13;
the United Kingdom combined. With a population of some 9.2 million, it is one of the least&#13;
densely populated countries in Africa. It is one the most urbanized countries in Sub-Saharan&#13;
Africa, next to South Africa, with about 40 percent of the population living in cities and towns.&#13;
Copper has been the backbone of the economy and has had a central role in determining the&#13;
demographics of the country by creating urban centers in the Copperbelt that have drawn mine&#13;
workers from the rural areas with the promise of jobs and easy access to infrastructure and social&#13;
services. The proportion of the population living in poverty increased from 60 percent in the&#13;
mid-1970s to 69 percent in 1991.&#13;
1.2   Zambia adopted an ambitious economic reform program in 1991 aimed at reducing the&#13;
role of the state in the economy through decontrol, deregulation, and privatization and at&#13;
promoting faster private sector growth through reduced fiscal deficits and a more efficient public&#13;
sector focused on infrastructure and human development. The overall objective of this program&#13;
is to reduce poverty through faster and more broadly shared economic growth and improved&#13;
provision of social services.&#13;
1.3   Impressive progress has been accomplished in the past five years, especially in&#13;
liberalizing markets and reducing the role of government in commercial activities. An ambitious&#13;
privatization program is underway. Over half of the parastatals have been sold or liquidated, and&#13;
negotiations are underway for the privatization of the copper mining parastatal. Control on&#13;
prices, interest rates, imports, and exports have all been discontinued.&#13;
1.4    Macroeconomic performance has been uneven, particularly in the early years when&#13;
inflation was over 100 percent, but fiscal and monetary control have been more effective in the&#13;
past two years. The domestic budget achieved a small surplus in 1996. Progress on civil service&#13;
reform has also been limited, but the size of the public service has begun to decline, and plans to&#13;
restructure 14 ministries have been adopted, and implementation will begin in 1997.&#13;
1.5   The rate of economic growth was disappointing in the first five years of Zambia's&#13;
economic reform program. Overall GDP has been about flat since 1990; per capita GDP has&#13;
fallen by about 13 percent. Growth has been elusive because of incomplete and imperfect reform&#13;
implementation, the inevitable delays in investor response, and several droughts, along with the&#13;
considerable legacy of more than two decades of inefficiency and mismanagement from&#13;
Zambia's previous policies. Overall GDP is estimated to have grown by about 5 percent in 1996,&#13;
but only because good rains brought a 15 percent increase in agricultural GDP.&#13;
1.6   The country's economy has been, and is likely to remain, driven by the wealth of its&#13;
natural resources. Copper will continue to play an important role in the economy, but&#13;
diversification is needed. While the natural resource endowment could provide the basis for&#13;
accelerated and broad-economic growth, its improper management would constrain growth and&#13;
undermine efforts to alleviate poverty.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
B. THE ENVIRONMENTAL SITUATION&#13;
Importance of the Environment&#13;
1.7    Abundant water, land and forest resources could provide the basis for sustainable&#13;
development in the country. However, increasing pressure on these resources has given rise to&#13;
environmental degradation, constraints to growth and increasing poverty. The effects can be&#13;
seen most directly in declining agricultural productivity, resulting from a lack of proper water&#13;
and soil management; dwindling wildlife populations, as a consequence of poaching or&#13;
degradation of their natural habitat; and declining fisheries earnings, as a result of overfishing&#13;
and water pollution. Both air and water pollution affect the health and productivity of Zambia's&#13;
work force, particularly in the urban areas surrounding mining operations. Many Zambians lack&#13;
access to clean drinking water, adequate sanitation and solid waste management facilities. The&#13;
adverse effects of these conditions on health and productivity tend to disproportionately impact&#13;
the poor segments of society.&#13;
1.8    In recognition of the importance of the environment, the Government of Zambia has&#13;
taken several steps toward its management. In 1985, it adopted a National Conservation Strategy,&#13;
which laid the basis for the enactment of the Environmental Protection and Pollution Control Act&#13;
in 1990 and the subsequent establishment of the Environment Council of Zambia (ECZ) as its&#13;
statutory body. The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MENR) was established in&#13;
1991 to set environmental policies and coordinate the ministries involved in environmental and&#13;
natural resource matters. In December 1994, after a process of broad consultation, the&#13;
Government finalized the National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) which identified key&#13;
environmental problems and related institutional and legislative constraints, and recommended&#13;
actions for management and mitigation.&#13;

Issues and Concerns&#13;
1.9    The five major environmental issues identified in the NEAP include: (a) soil&#13;
degradation; (b) water pollution and inadequate sanitation; (c) deforestation; (d) air pollution,&#13;
especially in copper mining towns; and (e) wildlife depletion. The framework for addressing&#13;
these issues came out of a broad consultative process involving all segments of society.&#13;
1.10   Land. Agricultural land is abundant in Zambia, with only 6 percent of arable land&#13;
currently under continuous cultivation. Nevertheless, the predominant soils in Zambia are low in&#13;
nutrients, have low water retention capacities, and are generally strongly acidic. Land under&#13;
cultivation is often subject to degradation as a result of erosion, deforestation, nutrient loss, and&#13;
increasing of acidity levels. These problems, combined with a high rate of population growth&#13;
(3.5 percent per annum) and policy-induced changes in access to land, land use and patterns of&#13;
agricultural production, suggest a growing need to better manage agricultural land.&#13;
1.11   Water. Zambia is unusual in Southern Africa in that it is endowed with sufficient water&#13;
resources to meet present and expected longer-term demands. Rainfall generally is good,&#13;
groundwater is available everywhere in the country at less than 100 meters and reliable sources&#13;
of surface water are abundant. However, recent droughts have pointed to the need for&#13;
sustainable and sound management of water resources. While at present, there is no problem&#13;
with the quantity of water resources in Zambia, conflicting water demands have arisen in some&#13;
areas and environmental degradation has been increasingly observed. In the Kafue River Basin,&#13;
for example, competing demands for hydropower generation, agricultural production, urban&#13;
domestic and industrial use have created conflicts, and industrial waste in the Copperbelt and&#13;
Kafue Estates has polluted much of the Basin.&#13;
1.12   Access to clean water and sanitation is a growing problem. It is estimated that 59 percent&#13;
of the population has access to safe drinking water and that 55 percent has access to sanitation.&#13;
There has been little extension of the country's urban water delivery infrastructure since the&#13;
copper boom period ended. In response to this problem, the Bank is currently financing the&#13;
Urban Restructuring and Water Supply Project to rehabilitate urban water and sanitation systems&#13;
and rehabilitate small rural-piped systems. Water quality is also a cause for concern. In urban&#13;
areas, increasing quantities of domestic waste and inadequate sanitation pollute groundwater&#13;
supplies and surface water systems. Mining and industrial areas suffer from leaching of heavy&#13;
metals and release of other forms of industrial waste into rivers. The country's extensive&#13;
wetland ecosystems are also starting to be threatened.&#13;
1.13   Forest Resources. Forests and woodlands, which cover some 60 percent of the land&#13;
area in Zambia, are rich in biodiversity but relatively poor in commercial timber species.&#13;
Firewood and charcoal from these forests are the main cooking energy source for 90 percent of&#13;
households. Deforestation, estimated at some 139,000 hectares per year in the period 1975-&#13;
1990, has reached critical levels as a result of uncontrolled settlement, illegal logging, clearing&#13;
for agriculture and, to a lesser extent, shifting cultivation, forest fires, and charcoal production.&#13;
Deforestation is a major contributor to soil erosion and siltation.&#13;
1.14   Air. Air quality is of increasing concern, especially in the mining areas. At present,&#13;
sulfur oxide emissions from the mining industry rarely reach hazardous levels, though&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
concentrations near some mines routinely exceed the country's newly established air quality&#13;
standards, and increased incidence of respiratory diseases has been recorded in the Copperbelt.&#13;
Over the medium-term, it would be economically feasible to reduce emissions by converting&#13;
sulfur oxides into industrial sulfuric acid which could then be used in the leaching process to&#13;
recover copper from low grade oxide ores, however, substantial investment would be required.&#13;
1.15   Wildlife. Wildlife and unspoiled habitats are a rich national heritage, a source of&#13;
livelihood for rural and peri-urban communities, and a potential source of significant tourism&#13;
revenues. The country, rich in biodiversity, is believed to host 233 mammal, 731 bird, 145 reptile&#13;
and 156 fish species. Zambia's fauna is protected in 19 national parks covering 6.4 million&#13;
hectares, while regulated hunting is permitted in game management areas covering an additional&#13;
16.6 million hectares. The private sector operates another 19 game ranches. Wildlife is currently&#13;
threatened by poaching, land-use pressures, development of economic infrastructure, mining,&#13;
logging, overfishing, tourism development, bush fires, and the destruction of natural habitats.&#13;
Traditional chiefs, who formerly ensured sustainable use of wildlife resources, no longer have&#13;
legal power to do so. A lack of institutional capacity and staffing to protect and plan for the&#13;
sustainable management and utilization of wildlife exacerbates the problem.&#13;

C. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK&#13;
Policy Context&#13;
1.16   Key policy orientations stemming from the National Conservation Strategy for Zambia&#13;
and the NEAP include:&#13;
* ensuring the sustainable use of Zambia's renewable natural resources;&#13;
* maintaining Zambia's biological diversity, including the range of biological&#13;
material governing the quality and productivity of domesticated plants and animals,&#13;
the rich diversity of wild species, as well as essential ecological processes and&#13;
life-support systems;&#13;
* developing an understanding and public awareness of environmental issues, and&#13;
reinforcing sound traditional practices to preserve natural resources and the habitat;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
* fostering greater self-sufficiency within communities and building up their capacity&#13;
to take control of their resources and environment;&#13;
* gradually transferring the prime responsibility for environmental conservation and&#13;
management from government to the people; and&#13;
* tackling poverty as a root cause of environmental degradation and unsustainable use&#13;
of natural resources.&#13;
1.17  In addition to these environmental policy orientations, the Government has recently&#13;
taken a number of important policy initiatives which directly affect the implementation of&#13;
programs in the environmental sector. Many of these initiatives are linked to the Public Sector&#13;
Reform Program which is only now being implemented, after being formulated in late 1993. The&#13;
three most critical policies and the implications of these policies are:&#13;
*  Restructuring the Public Service. The main thrust of the Public Sector Reform&#13;
Program is to create a 'less costly, but more efficient Public Service,' which in&#13;
practice means smaller government.&#13;
* Decentralization and Strengthening of Local Government. The aim of this policy&#13;
is to reduce the concentration of government by devolving powers and functions to&#13;
the provinces and districts. Several ministries have already transferred staff and&#13;
responsibilities to the districts.&#13;
* Privatization. Consistent with the goal of 'small government' is the increased&#13;
emphasis on the private sector and the transfer of responsibility for some services&#13;
and agencies to the private sector, non-governmental and quasi-governmental&#13;
bodies, as well as local communities. The move toward greater involvement of,&#13;
and responsibility assumed by, communities is a direct consequence of this policy.&#13;
Legislative and Regulatory Framework&#13;
1.18   The Environmental Protection and Pollution Control Act constitutes the overall umbrella&#13;
legislation for the environment. Zambia also has a number of general and sectoral laws relating&#13;
to environmental protection. Under ESP preparation, a comprehensive report assessed the&#13;
legislation covering environmental management and environment-related sectors such as land,&#13;
agriculture, health, forest, national parks and wildlife, local government, fisheries, international&#13;
environmental cooperation, mines and minerals, and water resource management. The report&#13;
shows that: (a) much of this legislation does not contain specific provisions and detailed criteria&#13;
for the preservation and sustainable use of particular natural resources; (b) laws on economic&#13;
development, natural resource management and environmental protection are not coordinated,&#13;
with the exception of the Mines and Minerals Act of 1995, and the Mining Environmental&#13;
Regulations of 1996, which require mining operators to comply with national environmental&#13;
standards in mining operations; and (c) some penal and enforcement provisions in the legislation&#13;
are outdated.&#13;
1.19   Furthermore, the report shows that the domestic legislation is not always consistent with&#13;
the international environmental conventions that were ratified by Zambia, including: the 1968&#13;
Algiers Convention on Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources in Africa, the 1973&#13;
Washington Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
the 1985 Vienna Convention on the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the related 1987 Montreal&#13;
Protocol, the 1989 Basel Convention on Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes, the&#13;
1992 Rio Convention on Biological Diversity, the 1992 Rio Framework Convention on Climate&#13;
Change and the 1994 Convention to Combat Desertification. Improvement of the legal&#13;
framework would also have to ensure Zambia's full compliance with international environmental&#13;
conventions.&#13;
1.20   The Government is currently reviewing various laws and their implementing instruments&#13;
to update and improve the overall environmental legislation. The government, through ECZ, has&#13;
enacted an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 1997 legislation. It is also reviewing the&#13;
legislation pertaining to forest and land tenure.&#13;
1.21   An effective policy and legislative framework for effective environmental management&#13;
requires: (a) laying down standards and regulations that support current laws; (b) ensuring the&#13;
consistency of environmental laws and related laws e.g., investment law, land tenure legislation;&#13;
(c) building implementation capacity by training staff to carry out environmental management&#13;
functions; and (d) ensuring effectiveness of the judiciary.&#13;
Institutions&#13;
1.22   The sheer number and diversity of government agencies involved in environmental&#13;
management highlight the need for coordination and clarity in functions and responsibilities. In&#13;
addition to MENR, a number of ministries have significant environmental responsibilities:&#13;
Mines and Minerals; Agriculture, Food and Fisheries; Lands; Energy and Water; Tourism, under&#13;
which falls the National Parks and Wildlife Service; Local Government and Housing; and&#13;
Education. Under the purview of the MENR, ECZ has the main responsibility for coordinating&#13;
and managing environmental initiatives by these ministries and other agencies, and responsibility&#13;
for technical management of the environmental mandate, while MENR is charged with high&#13;
level coordination and policy direction. In addition to being empowered to oversee the&#13;
implementation and enforcement of the environmental policies drafted by the Ministry, ECZ is&#13;
also responsible for setting, enforcing and monitoring standards and measures of pollution&#13;
control; maintaining an information network and database; facilitating environmental education&#13;
and training; supervising the environmental impact assessment process; and, when necessary,&#13;
implementing high priority and cross-sectoral environmental projects.&#13;
1.23   Since their inception, the two environmental apex institutions (MENR and ECZ), have&#13;
been constrained by insufficient support from Government. ECZ, which relies on the government&#13;
for its regular budget, has only managed to maintain its operations through donor support from&#13;
the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and the Norwegian Agency for&#13;
Development Cooperation (NORAD). Only half of established positions have been filled. Some&#13;
current staff have received training through bilateral programs but much remains to be done on&#13;
training and capacity building to enable ECZ is to fully meet its mandate. However, the agency&#13;
has achieved considerable success, particularly in the field of pollution prevention and&#13;
protection.&#13;
1.24   At present, MENR has limited capacity to deal with environmental issues. Its two&#13;
departments--forestry and natural resources--have contributed little to the Ministry's overall&#13;
ability to carry out its environmental mandate. However, MENR has a number of competent&#13;
officers with environmental experience who will be brought together in a new department, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
Planning and Information Department (PID). The establishment of this new departmnent, if&#13;
matched with institutional support and training, would help address capacity constraints.&#13;
1.25   Through the ESP, the Government has committed itself to improving institutional&#13;
performance by assigning clear institutional responsibilities in order to: (a) minimize&#13;
opportunities for conflict among various agencies and bodies involved in environmental&#13;
management; (b) better define the functions of relevant agencies; and (c) ensure effective&#13;
coordination among government agencies and other actors such as local communities, NGOs and&#13;
the private sector.&#13;
D. THE ENVIRONMENTAL AGENDA&#13;
1.26   The NEAP outlines the Government's current agenda for coping with the key&#13;
environmental issues and concerns presented above. Institutional and legal issues are at the&#13;
forefront of this agenda. It is recognized that an effective, sustainable, prevention-oriented&#13;
framework must be in place before irreversible environmental damage is done and the costs of&#13;
remediation mount. While effective performance of MENR and ECZ are key to successfully&#13;
achieving this goal, active and coordinated programs and initiatives by the sector ministries and&#13;
agencies and cross-sectoral bodies such as the Ministry of Local Government and Housing&#13;
(MLG&amp;H) are also critical to sound environmental and natural resource management.&#13;
1.27   The main challenges lie in strengthening institutional and legislative capacities and&#13;
frameworks; providing guidelines and enforcement mechanisms for sustainable natural resource&#13;
management and environmental protection; coordinating and monitoring the activities of&#13;
government, parastatal and private sector interests; and raising environmental awareness in the&#13;
country and encouraging broader participation in the management of Zambia's natural heritage.&#13;
1.28   The Forest Act of 1973, the National Parks and Wildlife Acts of 1991 and, until recently,&#13;
the Lands Act of 1975, tended to weaken traditional use and management systems.I This in turn&#13;
has undermined incentives for local communities to manage their forests, wildlife and other&#13;
resources. A return of custodianship of natural resources to local communities would restore the&#13;
incentive to invest in and manage the resource base and local environment. Many of the&#13;
programs designed to support local communities are uncoordinated (giving rise to duplication)&#13;
and do not enable communities to deal adequately with environmental issues. Moreover, current&#13;
understanding of the nature and magnitude of environmental and natural resource management&#13;
problems facing Zambia is limited. There is a need for mechanisms to facilitate local interaction&#13;
on environmental issues and provide financial resources and empower communities to manage&#13;
their resources sustainably. The Land Act has since been revised in 1995 to address some of&#13;
these issues.&#13;
E. LESSONS LEARNED FROM PAST OPERATIONS&#13;
1.29   The Bank's assistance strategy for environmental management is based on a dialogue&#13;
with the Government, lessons from previous Bank/IDA operations, and the Bank's global&#13;
perspective on the environment. Although this is the first Bank Group lending specifically&#13;
The Land Act was revised in 1995 while the National Parks and Wildlife Act and Forest Acts are in&#13;
the process of being revised.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
aimed at the environment in Zambia, much of the prior lending for the agriculture and urban&#13;
infrastructure sectors has had a direct impact on the environment. The main lessons learned&#13;
from these operations and other ESPs implemented in the region are: (a) avoid overly ambitious&#13;
goals and minimize the inherent complexity of this kind of program; (b) set clear priorities&#13;
through a process of consensus building and active stakeholder involvement; (c) promote&#13;
community ownership through a highly participatory approach to program preparation and&#13;
implementation; and (d) start with a modest and flexible first-phase program to progressively&#13;
strengthen institutional capacity and initiate the process of change. These lessons are reflected&#13;
in the proposed ESP.&#13;
F. OTHER DONOR ASSISTANCE&#13;
1.30   Several donors and NGOs 2 (see Annex 5) have provided support for institutional&#13;
strengthening, pollution prevention programs and other environmental initiatives. However, it is&#13;
recognized that these initiatives must fit within a comprehensive regulatory and institutional&#13;
framework if they are to be fully effective and their full potential realized. The present&#13;
fragmentation of efforts and inefficient coordination mechanisms have been a constraint to the&#13;
development of future donor support for the environment. Because of this situation, there has&#13;
been a strong and coordinated support from the donor community for the joint Government/Bank&#13;
initiative to develop the Environmental Support Program (ESP).&#13;
G. RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
1.31   Rationale for IDA Involvement. The program is in line with the Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board on July 18, 1996, which supports a three pronged&#13;
strategy to assist Zambia's development efforts: (a) help create a stable macroeconomic&#13;
environment as a prerequisite for growth and employment; (b) promote private sector&#13;
development and greater public sector efficiency to stimulate more rapid and inclusive growth;&#13;
and (c) target assistance to poor and vulnerable groups directly. Effective environmental&#13;
management is a critical feature of the second and third prongs of this strategy, as the sustainable&#13;
management and use of Zambia's natural resources is fundamental for economic development&#13;
and poverty reduction. Responding to the Government's request for Bank assistance provides an&#13;
opportunity to help shape Zambia's regulatory and institutional framework, establish&#13;
environmental policy and financial instruments, and ensure the integration of environmental&#13;
concerns into Zambia's economy. The Bank, having supported the preparation of the NEAP, has&#13;
already made a substantive contribution to improving environmental awareness but much&#13;
remains to be done. Continued involvement of the Bank is essential to sustain the Government's&#13;
commitment to difficult but critical changes in its public investment program and its reform of&#13;
the civil service, including strengthening the capacity of districts to respond to community&#13;
initiatives. The Bank also has a key role to play in helping the country mobilize Global&#13;
Environmental Facility (GEF) financing, given the global nature of the benefits that are expected&#13;
from improved biodiversity protection. The program follows successful introduction of ESPs in&#13;
other countries. As one of the first environmental, stand-alone lending operations in Southern&#13;
Africa, it could serve as a guide for other countries in the Region.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

2. THE PROGRAM&#13;
A. PROGRAM RATIONALE&#13;
2.1    The program would support the objectives of both the Government's development&#13;
strategy and the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy which seek to reduce poverty within the&#13;
framework of economic growth and protection of the environment and natural resources. Within&#13;
the NEAP's long-term perspective, the program would help the Government initiate a capacity&#13;
building effort to better address environmental issues. This would be part of a long-term,&#13;
multi-donor effort to finance projects and programs which have been generated by, or are in line&#13;
with, the NEAP priorities and recommendations. While it is important that environmental issues&#13;
be dealt with in an holistic manner, it is also essential that the responsibility for integrating and&#13;
strengthening environmental initiatives in program implementation remains with sector&#13;
ministries. Since existing institutions and the linkages between these institutions and other&#13;
stakeholders are weak, it would be important for ESP to foster intersectoral linkages, promote&#13;
capacity building at central and district levels, raise awareness, rationalize environmental&#13;
legislation and mainstream the use of EIAs in investment operations. ESP would also contribute&#13;
to the process, already underway, of empowering local communities in their role as custodians of&#13;
the natural resource base and in tackling environmental issues of local concern.&#13;
B. PROGRAM APPROACH&#13;
2.2   The approach taken in designing the ESP emphasizes active involvement of the various&#13;
stakeholders in program formulation in order to build a sense of ownership and facilitate&#13;
implementation. The approach has proved to be successful in a number of countries and has&#13;
resulted in programs which are more in tune with local capacity, while also recognizing the&#13;
particular constraints with which the stakeholders themselves have to contend. The ESP&#13;
approach has been designed to allow considerable flexibility in implementation and&#13;
responsiveness to priorities which might emerge during implementation. The support provided&#13;
would form the first phase of a long-term commitment to the improvement of the environment&#13;
and the sustainable use of natural resources. It would be limited in scope and ambition and&#13;
would include a number of small and challenging pilot initiatives which, if successful, could be&#13;
developed into full-fledged national activities. A similar approach was successfully employed&#13;
with the Bank-supported Social Recovery Project (SRP) which, now in its second stage, is&#13;
considered to be one of the model programs in the country.&#13;
2.3    The program would have an institutional focus. It would concentrate on building up the&#13;
capacity of the two apex organizations and developing environmental awareness and&#13;
management processes in sector ministries and agencies. As part of this focus, an environmental&#13;
presence would also be established at the district level, on a pilot basis, to determine how a&#13;
participatory environmental management capacity could best be developed in the communities.&#13;
As part of the long-term decentralization effort, the goal should be to transfer progressively the&#13;
responsibility for such management from Government to the communities.&#13;
2.4   The program would combine tightly targeted initiatives with more broadly applied ones.&#13;
The targeted initiatives would be employed to direct support to the poorer members of society,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
and to poorer communities in both rural and urban areas. It is the poor who often live in the&#13;
most degraded areas and who, because of their condition and lack of options, contribute to&#13;
environmental degradation. The provision of incentives to develop environmentally sound&#13;
investment and income generating projects would enable communities to gradually reduce their&#13;
poverty and adopt a more sustainable approach to resource utilization, thereby tackling poverty&#13;
alleviation within an environmental framework. Along with targeted interventions, the ESP&#13;
would support broad-based initiatives, such as the program on environmental education and&#13;
public awareness and the development of environmental information systems, designed to foster&#13;
a better understanding of environmental issues.&#13;
2.5   Inherent in program design is a multi-donor approach. The Bank's role is that of a&#13;
facilitator and catalyst in the process, working with Government, the donors and other&#13;
stakeholders to help design and prepare the ESP. The program, by creating a framework for&#13;
tackling the concerns of the NEAP, would complement and reinforce the ongoing and planned&#13;
activities of the core group of donors and NGOs already active in the environmental arena.&#13;
Upcoming initiatives by two donors, NORAD and CIDA, would complement and be closely&#13;
linked to ESP components. These initiatives have been designed in consultation with&#13;
government and are directed at strengthening institutional capacity3. Other donors have&#13;
indicated their interest in supporting the ESP once a sound program is developed and they are&#13;
able to see the most appropriate application for their assistance.&#13;

Within its proposed Industrial Pollutfon Prevention Program, NORAD plans to provide support to&#13;
ECZ in strengthening its capacity to enforce air emission and hazardous waste regulations and&#13;
standards. Similarly, CIDA would provide a second tranche of funding to continue its program of&#13;
support to ECZ focused on strengthening capacity to enforce regulations and carry out critical clean-&#13;
up operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

C. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.6   The program will support the Government's development strategy of poverty reduction&#13;
within the framework of economic growth and protection of the environment and natural&#13;
resources. The program aims to mainstream environmental and natural resource management in&#13;
Zambia's development processes at the national and local levels. At the national level, it will&#13;
strengthen the institutional and regulatory framework for environmental protection and natural&#13;
resource management. At the community level, it will strengthen local institutions and initiate a&#13;
process to enable rural and urban communities to address natural resource degradation and&#13;
capitalize on environmentally-sound investment opportunities. The key to the achievement of&#13;
these objectives would be the development of mechanisms to foster the interchange of ideas, and&#13;
the active participation and coordination of stakeholders at all levels. The lessons learned during&#13;
the proposed ESP would be incorporated in the preparation of the second phase of NEAP&#13;
implementation which would continue the process of institutional strengthening and expand&#13;
environmental interventions in priority areas.&#13;
D. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION&#13;
Summary Description of the Program&#13;
2.7   The program would have four main components:&#13;
- Institutional Strengthening and Legal Framework, which would aim to put in place&#13;
an effective institutional and regulatory framework for environmental protection&#13;
and natural resource management, and to pilot a Community Environmental&#13;
Management Program;&#13;
* Environmental Education and Public Awareness (EEPA), which would assist in&#13;
raising public awareness on environmental issues and would enable communities to&#13;
assume increased responsibility for environmental management through education;&#13;
* Pilot Environmental Fund (PEF), which would: (a) put in place an incentive&#13;
mechanism to promote community-based micro-projects, and (b) finance result-&#13;
oriented studies and the development of action plans and strategies of national&#13;
importance; and&#13;
* Environmental Information Management, which would support the establishment&#13;
of: (a) an Environmental Information Network and Monitoring Systems (EINMS)&#13;
comprising an EINMS Forum and several issue-oriented information sub-systems;&#13;
and (b) a monitoring, evaluation and reporting system as a management tool for&#13;
ESP.&#13;
2.8   These components, which are discussed below, would be closely interlinked and&#13;
mutually reinforcing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
Institutional Strengthening and Legal Framework (US$ 8.52 million4)&#13;
2.9   The component would comprise the following activities:&#13;
* Policy Formulation and Institutional Assessment, which would help Government&#13;
develop a national environmental policy document and analyze the roles, and&#13;
responsibilities in the key environmental institutions;&#13;
* Institutional Capacity Building, which would develop staff skills at ECZ, MENR&#13;
and other agencies involved with environmental activities, assist in setting-up sound&#13;
management practices and help to integrate environmental concerns into the&#13;
decision-making process of line ministries, local governments and NGOs;&#13;
* Community Environmental Management Program, which would aim to facilitate&#13;
demand-driven development to support an improved environment and better use of&#13;
natural resources at rural and urban community levels; and&#13;
* Legal Framework and Enforcement Capacity, which would help remove conflicts&#13;
and gaps and develop a consistent body of environmental legislation with the&#13;
associated procedures and standards to ensure that the legislation is enforceable.&#13;
2.10   Policy Formulation and Institutional Assessment. This activity would comprise two&#13;
initiatives. Firstly, it would provide support to assist the Government in defining a series of&#13;
environmental and natural resource policies consistent with the overall recommendations of the&#13;
NEAP. Secondly, it would establish a more effective organizational framework, as well as&#13;
linkages and operating procedures in key institutions involved in environmental management.&#13;
This would be the responsibility of PID. Thereafter, within the agreed management structure,&#13;
the detailed requirements for staff upgrading would be identified, training programs developed,&#13;
and improved management practices spelled out. While most of this work would take place in&#13;
the first year of the program, the program would be an interactive process aimed at continually&#13;
assessing the organizations involved and refining the support provided under ESP. Assurances&#13;
were obtained at negotiations that environmental policies would be reviewed through a&#13;
consultative process, a consensus established, and the agreed set of policies presented in a&#13;
document for submission to the Cabinet by December 31, 1999. Assurances were also obtained&#13;
on the implementation of the sectoral and policy reform according to the Letter of Development&#13;
Policy dated May 28, 1996.&#13;
2.11   An initial institutional assessment, endorsed by MENR and ECZ, was carried out in&#13;
November 1996 to clarify the roles of the two environmental apex organizations. The&#13;
assessment recommended alternative institutional strategies to enable the organizations involved&#13;
in environmental management to effectively fulfill their mandates and manage the ESP.&#13;
2.12   Institutional Capacity Building. This activity would: (a) provide training and&#13;
technical assistance in environmental/natural resource management, environmental economics,&#13;
financial planning and programming, and other management techniques for the two&#13;
environmental apex units; (b) establish an ESP Coordination Office and, through staff training&#13;
and long-term consultancies, help build up the capacity of PID to manage the ESP; (c) establish&#13;
environment units or focal points within seven core line ministries; (d) improve communications&#13;
The investment for each component is expressed in base costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13-&#13;
and introduce cross-sectoral linkages through inter-agency seminars, meetings and other&#13;
interactions; and (e) support private organizations and NGOs active in urban areas and rural&#13;
communities. The institutional capacity building will be the responsibility of MENR.&#13;
2.13   Community Environmental Management Program. A key part of institutional&#13;
strengthening activities would be the initiation, on a pilot scale, of a program to support&#13;
community environmental management. It would actively involve communities--both rural and&#13;
urban--in environmental planning, decision-making and implementation, and over time, develop&#13;
their capacity to assume responsibility for management of their local environments. Central to&#13;
this process would be the establishment of a new position of Environmental Facilitator, to be the&#13;
coordinator of all environmental initiatives in the district. This person would work with&#13;
communities, act as a broker on their behalf, coordinate environmental activities of other district&#13;
officers, harmonize ESP initiatives and generally act as a catalyst for environmental activities in&#13;
the district. The program would fund, initially on a contract basis, the introduction of&#13;
Environmental Facilitators in a limited number of districts. These Facilitators would ensure that&#13;
lessons could be learned as the program progresses. The funding would cover: (a) establishing,&#13;
equipping and operating district environmental offices and a unit in the PID to manage this pilot&#13;
program; (b) preparation of operational and training manuals; and (c) the provision of training&#13;
and technical assistance.&#13;
2.14   Legal Framework and Enforcement Capacity. The purpose of this activity is to&#13;
enhance the ability of the Government to draw up and enforce laws and regulations protecting&#13;
the environment. This activity exhibits a close complementarity with that of institutional&#13;
capacity building. In many respects they are mutually dependent. It would comprise three main&#13;
elements: (a) harmonizing environmental statutes and regulations; (b) strengthening institutional&#13;
enforcement capacity; and (c) enhancing community awareness and enforcement capacity.&#13;
2.15   Harmonization would address legal inconsistencies, conflicts and gaps in order to&#13;
produce a consistent and mutually supporting set of environmental legislation. This would&#13;
include: (a) reviewing the Environmental Protection and Pollution Control Act in order to&#13;
clarify the mandates and responsibilities of the institutions involved in environmental&#13;
management and to reflect new initiatives at local and community levels; (b) reviewing&#13;
regulations for environmental impact assessment; and (c) preparing, in conjunction with the&#13;
NORAD-funded Industrial Pollution Prevention Program, a set of regulations related to&#13;
hazardous wastes, air pollution, and water quality standards and monitoring.&#13;
2.16   The strengthening of institutional enforcement capacity would be done through seminars&#13;
and training programs in environmental law, environmental assessment and monitoring, and&#13;
enforcement techniques. A small core of trained staff would be created in each of the key&#13;
ministries and agencies responsible for environmental activities. In addition, staff in the&#13;
Ministry of Legal Affairs and ECZ would receive graduate training in environmental law.&#13;
2.17   The strengthening of community awareness and enforcement capability would aim at&#13;
increasing the capacity of communities to participate in environmental initiatives and to manage&#13;
and police their own resources. This would be done by revising the legislation and by&#13;
conducting workshops to raise community awareness of environmental issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
Environmental Education and Public Awareness (US$ 1.78 million)&#13;
2.18   The Environmental Education and Public Awareness (EEPA) component would&#13;
complement the upcoming Education Sector Investment Program. It would foster increased&#13;
public awareness of environmental issues; support ESP's legal initiatives by developing local&#13;
communities' recognition of their roles and rights in managing their environment; assist the&#13;
public to assume individual and collective responsibility for environmental management; and&#13;
contribute to the national debate and the interchange of ideas among stakeholders in Zambia's&#13;
natural heritage. Training would be provided to enhance the capacity of various bodies involved&#13;
with natural resource and environmental management--including key government agencies,&#13;
educational institutions, the media, NGOs, and traditional and religious leaders. The component&#13;
would comprise five activities:&#13;
* Strengthening the ECZ Education and Communication Unit, for program&#13;
coordination;&#13;
* Media training and sensitization;&#13;
* Curriculum review and modification at primary and secondary school levels;&#13;
* Support to Environmental Management Programs in the districts; and&#13;
* Surveys of community environmental awareness.&#13;
2.19   Strengthening the Education and Communication Unit (ECU) of ECZ. This&#13;
activity is designed to provide short-term technical assistance, training, material and equipment&#13;
to enable the ECU to fulfill its mandate and to oversee the environmental education component&#13;
of ESP. The Unit would assist in the preparation and dissemination of environmental&#13;
information, through the formal education system, government published documents and the&#13;
mass media. It would provide education support to the Community Environmental Management&#13;
Program. Specialized services would be contracted to design and produce media materials on&#13;
topical environmental issues and events. The Unit would liaise with the Ministry of Education to&#13;
prepare a draft Environmental Education Strategy to aid the design of related investments under&#13;
later phases of ESP.&#13;
2.20   Media Training and Sensitization. The media training and sensitization program&#13;
would raise the profile of environmental issues on the agendas ofjournalists and program&#13;
designers. The program would make funds available to inform media personnel (managers,&#13;
editors and key journalists) about ESP programs, environmental strategies and the respective&#13;
roles anticipated for the various stakeholders involved in natural resource and enviromnental&#13;
management. The program would also finance a review of the environmental coverage in the&#13;
media and monitor changes in the level and quality of coverage during the course of ESP&#13;
implementation.&#13;
2.21   Curriculum Review and Modification. Building on the work of the Zambian&#13;
Environmental Education Program, this activity would assist the Curriculum Development&#13;
Center of the Ministry of Education in suggesting improvements in environmental education,&#13;
particularly in primary and secondary schools. An initial review would ascertain the&#13;
environmental content of current educational materials. The findings would guide: (a) the&#13;
development of modified teacher training programs and supplementary environmental training&#13;
courses for curriculum developers and (b) the re-design of selected school materials and training&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
manuals to incorporate environmental issues. Materials would be updated periodically through&#13;
newsletters for teachers and would incorporate information on indigenous environmental&#13;
knowledge or other recent knowledge to be derived from specially commissioned studies.&#13;
Modified materials would be introduced on an experimental basis into education programs in the&#13;
pilot districts of the Community Environmental Management Program.&#13;
2.22   Support to Environmental Management Programs in the Districts. This activity&#13;
would enable the ECU to respond to the requirements of specialized environmental education&#13;
identified through district and community-based planning processes. Subject to eligibility&#13;
criteria5, funds would be available for: (a) consultants and contracted services; (b) training and&#13;
workshops; and (c) information dissemination, including publications. Seventy-five percent of&#13;
funds would be used to complement the community-based aspects of other ESP components&#13;
within the framework of community environmental action plans. The balance would be available&#13;
for similar initiatives of provincial or national interest.&#13;
2.23   Surveys of Community Environmental Awareness. Funds would be allocated to&#13;
contract an initial baseline assessment and subsequent annual surveys of the level of&#13;
communities' awareness of environmental issues. Survey results would be part of the ESP&#13;
monitoring and evaluation system and be used as a feedback mechanism to inform ECZ and PID&#13;
of the effectiveness of various ESP activities.&#13;
Pilot Environmental Fund (US$ 4.26 million)&#13;
2.24   The Pilot Environmental Fund (PEF) would provide financial incentives to communities&#13;
through a matching grant facility that would enable them to tackle environmental issues of local&#13;
concern by adopting 'best practices' in local resource management. To date, there has been a&#13;
lack of funding for environmental initiatives, despite a recognition among many communities of&#13;
existing possibilities to better utilize or conserve the resource base in rural areas or ameliorate&#13;
environmental conditions in urban localities. Access to the Fund would promote a return of&#13;
environmental custodianship and strengthen the willingness and capacity of communities to&#13;
invest in the environment. The Fund would also stimulate widespread interest and opportunities&#13;
in conducting practically-oriented studies of key natural resource management and&#13;
environmental issues. Study grants, to be made available through the Fund, would help improve&#13;
understanding of the nature and magnitude of the natural resource management and&#13;
environmental problems facing Zambia and to develop appropriate solutions.&#13;
2.25   The PEF would comprise the Fund itself and a small national level unit which would be&#13;
integrated within the management structure of the SRP. The Fund would have two windows, one&#13;
to finance community-based initiatives and the other to fund environmental studies.&#13;
2.26   PEF Community-Based Initiatives Fund. The Fund (US$ 2.74 million 6) would&#13;
finance matching grants for eligible micro-projects identified through the pilot activities of the&#13;
Community Environmental Management Program and developed in partnership with selected&#13;
rural and urban communities. Funds would be allocated on the basis of clearly defined eligibility&#13;
These would be defined by ECZ in consultation with the PID.&#13;
6  Including PEF Secretariat and associated support costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
criteria and procedures (see Annex 2, Attachment 2). An indicative list of the types of micro-&#13;
projects which may be considered for financing is given in Annex 2, Attachment 1. The number&#13;
of micro-projects to be financed each year would remain flexible and is expected to be&#13;
determined mainly by the rate of expansion of the Community Environmental Management&#13;
Program and communities' response to new investment opportunities.&#13;
2.27   PEF Environmental Studies Fund. The Studies Fund (US$ 1.52 million) would be&#13;
established to deal with priority topics. The Fund would finance investigations with a practical,&#13;
problem-solving orientation including:&#13;
* research proposals (studies and surveys) and environmental impact assessments&#13;
arising from the Community Environmental Management Program and designed to&#13;
complement the prospective micro-projects;&#13;
* studies on the relationship between poverty and environmental degradation and the&#13;
way in which it affects different social groups;&#13;
* small-scale studies of wider application;&#13;
* design of medium to long-term strategies of national importance such as&#13;
biodiversity and renewable energy;&#13;
* studies of the long-term management structure and financial sustainability of the&#13;
PEF, and studies to update the NEAP, and initiate the preparation of the next ESP;&#13;
and&#13;
* studies to prevent or mitigate environmental emergencies.&#13;
Environmental Information Management (US$ 3.91 million)&#13;
2.28   Environmental Information Network and Monitoring System (EINMS). The&#13;
EINMS would provide action-oriented environmental information and decision support tools to&#13;
the various stakeholders involved in the ESP, to allow them to better assess environmental&#13;
issues, plan and implement activities, and capture early lessons through monitoring and&#13;
evaluation. The EINMS would address coordination issues at the national level, while also&#13;
developing information systems at the district level, with a particular emphasis on participatory&#13;
processes involving the direct users and custodians of environmental information. The EINMS&#13;
would be oriented to problem solving, focusing on concrete environmental issues and targeting&#13;
policies and intervention strategies. The network would also establish the foundation for&#13;
progressively building a cost-efficient national Environmental Information System (EIS) that&#13;
would make information for environmental decision-making in Zambia more readily available&#13;
and accessible. Attention would also be paid to facilitate open public access to environmental&#13;
information.&#13;
2.29   The choice of activities to be funded under EINMS would be based on priority&#13;
environmental issues that require information services. The activities to be funded under&#13;
EINMS represent the first stage in the implementation of Zambia's strategy to develop an EIS.&#13;
Additional EINMS activities would complement ongoing or planned activities supported by&#13;
other donors. Work has already been started with support to ECZ from NORAD and CIDA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
2.30   The activities to be financed by IDA under the EINMS are:&#13;
* establishment of an EINMS forum and coordination of EIS activities; and&#13;
* development of issues-oriented information sub-systems.&#13;
2.31   The establishment of an EINMS Forum and Technical Secretariat, which would&#13;
facilitate coordination of EIS activities and cooperation amongst stakeholders, is essential for the&#13;
information system to be cost-effective, action-oriented and user driven. The Secretariat would&#13;
be open to all private and public sector institutions concerned or involved with the production or&#13;
management of environmental information. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that&#13;
the composition of the Forum, its terms of reference and functions would be submitted to IDA by&#13;
June 30, 1998. The Forum would focus on practical issues, including determining data&#13;
custodianship and operational responsibilities to avoid duplication of efforts; deciding on&#13;
measures to increase data sharing and exchange; and ensuring the interoperability of databases&#13;
by the adoption of a common data architecture as well as norms and standards. The Forum&#13;
would be supported by a technical secretariat hosted in ECZ that would supervise efforts&#13;
addressing specific technical issues such as publication of metadata, development of data&#13;
standards, organization of training courses for technical staff, and arranging executive training&#13;
seminars for decision makers and other EIS users and stakeholders.&#13;
2.32   The EINMS would also support the development of Information SubSystems for&#13;
each of the five priority environmental issues defined in the NEAP: (a) soil degradation;&#13;
(b) water pollution and inadequate sanitation; (c) deforestation; (d) air pollution; and (e) wildlife&#13;
depletion. Implemented at the district level, these information systems would seek to develop&#13;
both technical capacity to build environmental databases and operational capacity to use them.&#13;
The sub-systems would be located in districts where other ESP activities would be operating.&#13;
Furthermore, the sub-systems would integrate information collected by the Community&#13;
Environment Management Program on the basis of participatory rural appraisal techniques.&#13;
2.33   Establishment of an ESP Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) System. The proposed&#13;
M&amp;E system would be designed as a management tool to synthesize input, output and impact&#13;
indicators provided by ESP implementation agencies (see Annex 1). It would provide decision-&#13;
makers with quick and regular feedback on implementation progress and thus ensure that lessons&#13;
learned during program implementation rapidly translate into adjustments to the program. The&#13;
M&amp;E would have three activities: (a) monitoring of key program performance indicators;&#13;
(b) gathering information on key program management (disbursement, procurement), and&#13;
(c) conducting impact evaluations, including beneficiary assessments, on a bi-annual basis.&#13;

3. PROGRAM COSTING AND FINANCING&#13;
A. COST ESTIMATES&#13;
3.1      The total cost of this ESP is estimated at US$20.8 million, including physical and price&#13;
contingencies. The foreign exchange component is estimated at US$10.0 million, equivalent to&#13;
48 percent of the total. Since the Zambian Government provides for exemption of taxes for&#13;
internationally-financed projects, no taxes or duties have been included in the base cost estimate.&#13;
It is estimated, however, that taxes on the program would amount to approximately US$300,000.&#13;
3.2      Physical contingencies have been calculated at 10 percent of the base cost of furniture&#13;
and office equipment and are estimated at approximately US$140,000 over the five year&#13;
implementation period. On price contingencies, it is estimated that international inflation, taken&#13;
from  the Bank's MUV  Index,7 will be approximately 2.3 percent per annum  over the life of the&#13;
project. It is assumed that the local exchange rate would adjust to compensate for differences&#13;
between local and international inflation. Total price contingencies for the project are estimated&#13;
at US$1.8 million. A breakdown of local and foreign costs by expenditure account is shown in&#13;
the table below:&#13;

B. FINANCING&#13;
3.3    Of the total estimated cost for the ESP of US$20.8 million, US$2.2 million (11 percent&#13;
of the total cost) would be cofinanced by NDF, US$3.2 million (15 percent of the total cost)&#13;
would be financed by UNDP, and US$2.6 million (13 percent of the total cost) would financed&#13;
by GRZ with participation by communities. The remaining costs would be financed by IDA&#13;
with a credit of US$12.8 million (61 percent of the total cost).&#13;
3.4    Government would provide an increasing share of local costs, mainly operating costs and&#13;
related allowances and the costs of local training efforts. Through their contributions to the&#13;
financing of PEF-funded micro-projects (not less than 25 percent), communities would supply&#13;
about 2.4 percent of total program financing. A financing table in US dollars by type of&#13;
expenditure is shown in the following table. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that GRZ&#13;
would make the necessary provision of sufficient counterpart funds in a timely manner to cover&#13;
program recurrent costs as agreed in the annual work program review. As a condition of&#13;
effectiveness, the Government would establish the Project Account and deposit therein the initial&#13;
deposit of US$135,000 to finance Government's contribution to the cost of the Project in the first&#13;
twelve months after the Effective Date, less the cost of salaries and wages of civil servants.&#13;

C. PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.5    Procurement of goods and services for all IDA financed components would be carried&#13;
out in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA&#13;
Credits" published in January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996. Consultants,&#13;
including NGOs and other organizations providing services to the program, would be hired in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines - Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by&#13;
The World Bank as Executing Agency " dated January 1997. World Bank Standard Bidding and&#13;
Contract Documents would be used for all International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procurement&#13;
and for consultant contracts financed by IDA. National Competitive Bidding (NCB) would&#13;
follow procedures using standard documents approved by IDA. In the case of goods and&#13;
services financed by bilateral donors, procurement would be carried out in accordance with&#13;
procurement procedures and guidelines of the donor agencies. The Government would submit to&#13;
IDA, for review and comment, standard bidding documents and contracts proposed to be used&#13;
for all NCB procurement of goods and civil works prior to the issuing of the first Invitation for&#13;
Bid.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20-&#13;
3.6    Goods. Items to be financed under the goods component of the ESP would include&#13;
vehicles, office and field equipment, office furniture and supplies, computers and peripherals.&#13;
Similar items would be grouped into individual contract "packages" when feasible. Procurement&#13;
packages equal to or greater than the equivalent of US$100,000 would be bid using ICB&#13;
procedures in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. A domestic preference would be&#13;
employed in evaluation procedures, where applicable, in ICB procurement as per paragraph 2.54&#13;
and Appendix 2 of the IDA guidelines. It is most likely that ICB would be used for procurement&#13;
of vehicles, major office equipment, computers, and printers.&#13;
3.7    Goods packages valued at US$30,000 to US$100,000, up to an aggregate value of&#13;
US$2 10,000, could be procured using NCB, acceptable to IDA. Goods packages valued at less&#13;
than US$30,000, up to an aggregate value of US$1.6 million procured as investment or as&#13;
incremental operational costs, could be procured using shopping procedures with quotations&#13;
from at least three eligible and qualified suppliers in accordance with local procedures. It is&#13;
estimated that, of the approximately US$1.2 million of goods included in the incremental&#13;
operational costs of the project, about 50 percent would be procured using National Shopping&#13;
Procedures with the balance procured employing direct, "off-the-shelf" purchases from local&#13;
sources.&#13;
3.8    Micro-projects. Micro-projects under the ESP would be small and carried out under the&#13;
PEF component based on modalities of the PEF operations within IDA's Social Recovery Project&#13;
in Zambia as a guide. Procurement covered by micro-project grants would include items such&#13;
as: minor tools and equipment, purchase of seedlings, training materials, teaching aids and small&#13;
scale construction projects for water supply, storage, distribution and any other type of works in&#13;
accordance with the PEF general guidelines. Micro-project contracts with communities which&#13;
are estimated to cost less than the equivalent of US$30,000, up to an aggregate value of US$2.1&#13;
million, would be carried out utilizing procedures agreed to in the PEF Operational Guidelines&#13;
found acceptable to IDA, and in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3.15 of the&#13;
guidelines. Where practical, competitive procurement processes would be used to procure works&#13;
and goods under lump sum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of at least three&#13;
quotations.&#13;
3.9    Community contribution and full community involvement at all stages in micro-project&#13;
design and implementation would be required to ensure sustainability. Local expertise, materials&#13;
readily available in the communities, and labor intensive technologies, appropriate to local&#13;
conditions, would be used. Community participation would include furnishing labor and/or&#13;
materials valued at about 25 percent of the total project cost. Community micro-project&#13;
committees would manage their own projects, hiring skilled artisans and purchasing materials&#13;
and goods using either local shopping or direct contracting procedures, both having proven to be&#13;
efficient and expedient. Experience in Zambia has shown that it is not cost-effective to do bulk&#13;
procurement of building supplies and then distribute these to sites.&#13;
3.10   Consulting Services. Institutional technical assistance, environmental and feasibility&#13;
studies, as well as training and workshops, would be carried out by locally and internationally&#13;
recruited consultants (including NGOs) recruited by the respective implementing agencies.&#13;
Local and foreign experts could be recruited in specialized fields to assist in community&#13;
mobilization, environmental information systems, environmental education, and other&#13;
environment related fields as well as in finance and training. Consultants would be contracted in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's guidelines and qualifications, experience, and conditions of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21-&#13;
employment satisfactory to IDA. Consultants would be recruited on quality/cost based selection&#13;
(QCBS) as described in the guidelines.&#13;

3.11   Procurement Review Thresholds. An annual work program and budget would be&#13;
prepared and submitted to IDA no later than September 30 of each year for review and&#13;
comments. This annual work program would include a description of items proposed to be&#13;
procured during the following year with the estimated cost of each item. Items would be&#13;
packaged, where practical, to take advantage of savings through bulk procurement. Details of&#13;
procurement packages would be included as part of the annual work programs. Requirements for&#13;
IDA prior review of procurement documents are as follows.&#13;
(a)       Contracts for Civil Works and Goods. Invitation for Bids, draft bidding&#13;
documents, bid evaluation, and award recommendations for all contracts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22-&#13;
exceeding US$100,000 would be subject to prior review by IDA. In addition,&#13;
the first contract for NCB, both for goods and civil works, regardless of cost,&#13;
would be subject to prior review by IDA. Micro-project contracts equal to or&#13;
less than US$30,000 would follow procedures established in the PEF Operation&#13;
Guidelines which would be reviewed and found acceptable to IDA during&#13;
negotiations.&#13;
(b)   Consulting Firms and Individual Consultant Contracts. Before inviting&#13;
proposals, the Borrower would furnish to IDA for its review the short list and the&#13;
proposed Request for Proposal and would make such modifications as would be&#13;
requested by IDA. All contracts with firms or individuals awarded on&#13;
competitive basis and costing US$100,000 and US$50,000 or more respectively&#13;
would be subject to prior review by IDA in accordance with Appendix 1, of the&#13;
Consultant Guidelines. Also subject to prior review would be: (i) amendments&#13;
to competitively awarded contracts resulting in a revised value exceeding the&#13;
thresholds mentioned above; (ii) all Terms of Reference; and (iii) contracts for&#13;
assignments of a critical nature.&#13;
(c)    With respect to IDA's prior review of technical evaluation, the following would&#13;
apply.&#13;
(i)    For contracts with firms with a value estimated to be equal to or&#13;
exceeding US$100,000 but less than US$200,000, the Borrower would&#13;
notify IDA of the results of the technical evaluation prior to opening the&#13;
financial proposals.&#13;
(ii)   For contracts with firms with a value estimated to be equivalent to or&#13;
exceeding US$200,000 and for contracts with individuals with a value&#13;
estimated to be equivalent to or exceeding US$50,000, the Borrower&#13;
would fumish to IDA, in sufficient time for its review and comments, a&#13;
technical evaluation report and a copy of the proposals prior to entering&#13;
into a contract.&#13;
(d)   Training Programs and Workshops. Training workshops for participants,&#13;
government staff, communities, and NGOs would be carried out both locally and&#13;
internationally. These programs would be planned and budgeted as part of the&#13;
Borrower's annual work program and budget. The content of the annual training&#13;
program would be reviewed and commented on by IDA as part of the annual&#13;
work program and budget.&#13;
(e)    Contracts Below the Prior Review Threshold. All contracts and supporting&#13;
information (receipts, paid invoices, etc.) would be retained by PID and the SRP&#13;
and would be made available on a selected basis to IDA for ex-post review.&#13;
D. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
3.12   The proposed IDA Credit of US$12.8 million would be disbursed over five years with an&#13;
expected Project Completion Date of June 30, 2003 and a Closing Date of December 31, 2003.&#13;
The scheduled disbursements are based on the cost tables.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23-&#13;
3.13   Disbursement Procedures. Disbursement from the Credit would be in accordance with&#13;
normal IDA procedures set out in the Disbursement Handbook (Fourth Printing, October 1996).&#13;
Once agreement has been reached on the annual work programs and budgets with the&#13;
implementing agencies and on other conditionalities, disbursements from the credit would be&#13;
made following the standard procedures, including: reimbursement of expenses incurred by&#13;
implementing agencies against submission of disbursement requests; direct payment to suppliers;&#13;
or replenishment of special accounts.&#13;
3.14   MENR would be in charge of the disbursement procedures for the agencies involved in&#13;
implementation of the program. A financial controller, with expertise in the management of IDA&#13;
financed projects, would be stationed in MENR's PID and be responsible for financial&#13;
management and reporting.&#13;
3.15   Special Accounts. Smooth program implementation would be facilitated through the&#13;
opening of two special accounts in US Dollars in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA to allow&#13;
the effective flow and management of funds for financing ESP operations. Upon program&#13;
effectiveness, initial advances would be deposited in the Special Accounts against disbursement&#13;
application(s). Reimbursements would be grouped to facilitate replenishment of these Special&#13;
Accounts and submitted for reimbursement every month or whenever the Special Account&#13;
balances are reduced to one-third of the original amount, whichever comes first, through the&#13;
standard channel of disbursement procedures for the Special Accounts. The accounts may be&#13;
used to pay for expenditures in either local or foreign currency through the commercial banking&#13;
system, against any category of expenditure. All replenishments would be fully documented&#13;
except in cases where Statements of Expenditure (SOEs) are authorized.&#13;
3.16   The Main Special Account in the amount of US$600,000 equivalent would be used to&#13;
cover all program expenses except those of the PEF component. The initial deposit is expected&#13;
to be adequate to cover expenditures for a period of three months.&#13;
3.17   A separate PEF Special Account would be opened under SRP for the PEF. An initial&#13;
deposit would be made in the amount of US$400,000 to cover about four months at full&#13;
operation. Amounts would be drawn from the account to service approved micro-projects and&#13;
studies and finance the operating costs of the Secretariat. Matching grants for community-based&#13;
micro-projects would be transferred, under specified procedures, to bank accounts of&#13;
community-based organizations. The PEF Coordinator and financial officer would ensure that,&#13;
as soon as possible after the end of the Zambian financial year, but not later than six months after&#13;
its completion, the PEF Special Account and other PEF-related accounts be prepared for audit&#13;
with a separate opinion obtained on the use of the Special Account and SOEs. The audit report&#13;
for the community-based incentives fund would include a review of the performance of those&#13;
community-based organizations which have implemented micro-projects.&#13;
3.18   Disbursements from the Special Accounts would be made against standard IDA&#13;
documentation with the following exceptions for which certified SOEs would be used:&#13;
(a) contracts for goods, works, and consultant services (firms) costing less than US$100,000&#13;
equivalent; (b) contracts for consultant services (individuals) costing less than US$50,000; (c) all&#13;
local training courses; (d) in-country seminars and workshops; (e) all operating and maintenance&#13;
expenditures; (f) community-based micro-projects; and (g) environmental studies.&#13;
Documentation supporting SOE claims associated with the PEF would be kept at the SRP with&#13;
summary documentation forwarded to PID for information on a quarterly basis. Documentation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
supporting SOE claims associated with all other ESP activities would be kept in PID. All&#13;
accounts and necessary information would be made available for audits and review by Bank&#13;
missions. During the course of the annual audit of the SRP Accounts, the auditors would certify&#13;
that all expenditures claimed under SOEs, had been properly incurred for the PEF activities.&#13;

E. ACCOUNTS AND AUDITING&#13;
3.20   MENR, through PID, would maintain separate records and financial accounts for each&#13;
IDA-financed component, using generally accepted accounting principles. The audit for&#13;
SRP-managed PEF components would be carried out by the SRP under its existing procedures.&#13;
A set of consolidated financial accounts would be prepared every year. Responsibility for&#13;
preparation of the component accounts would rest with the financial controller appointed for this&#13;
purpose in the implementing agency for each component. The IDA Financial Controller in PID&#13;
would consolidate the financial statements for IDA-funded activities, and arrange for the annual&#13;
audit of the accounts in PID and the relevant implementing agencies. The PEF would be audited&#13;
as a distinct and separately identifiable component during the SRP annual audit. Assurances&#13;
were obtained at negotiations that the Government would appoint independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to IDA to audit the ESP accounts each fiscal year. A certified copy of the accounts,&#13;
together with the auditors' management report, would be submitted to IDA within six months of&#13;
the end of the financial year. The certificate would include a statement covering the adequacy of&#13;
the records and accounts used to support disbursements against SOEs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-26-&#13;
4. PROGRAM ORGANIZATION AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. PROGRAM MANAGEMENT&#13;
Institutional Arrangements&#13;
4.1   The program would be implemented according to the following principles: (a) it will be&#13;
implemented through existing institutions with the MENR having overall responsibility for its&#13;
coordination and management; (b) it will be implemented by a small core of implementing&#13;
agencies: MENR, ECZ, Ministry of Legal Affairs, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Local&#13;
Government and Housing, and Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MOFED); (c) it&#13;
would depend mainly on more effective use of staff, their training and the introduction of new&#13;
procedures rather than a major build-up in numbers or creation of new institutions. While some&#13;
of the agencies would need to recruit additional staff, in most cases the staff required are already&#13;
in place or the posts have been established but not yet filled; (d) many of the initiatives to be&#13;
implemented during the program would be sub-contracted to local or locally-based international&#13;
NGOs and local consulting firms.&#13;
Coordination and Consultation&#13;
4.2   The Planning and Information Department (PLD) of MENR would be the focal point&#13;
for program coordination. A team within PID, with full administrative and financial autonomy,&#13;
would have overall responsibility for ESP management and coordination. PID staff would be in&#13;
charge of program planning, coordination, community environmental management, monitoring,&#13;
evaluation, procurement and financial control. The team would be headed by the Chief Planning&#13;
Officer working on a full time basis. The PID would assign responsibility for ESP administrative&#13;
and financial management to a Senior Planning Officer. A second Senior Planning Officer&#13;
would be in charge of the Community Environmental Management Program. As a condition of&#13;
effectiveness, the Government would establish, as part of the ongoing restructuring of MENR,&#13;
the Planning and Information Department and appoint the following key staff to the PID, that is,&#13;
a Chief Planning Officer, and two Senior Planning Officers, all having qualifications and terms&#13;
of reference acceptable to the Association.&#13;
4.3    An independent advisory body, the National Environmental Steering Commiutee&#13;
(NESC), would be established to: provide policy guidance, administrative backstopping,&#13;
international linkages, and coordination between ministries, other government agencies, NGOs,&#13;
donors and the private sector; approve ESP's consolidated annual work program and budget; and&#13;
ensure effective representation of the views and concerns of the key stakeholders. The NESC,&#13;
which would meet twice yearly and on an ad hoc basis as required, would be chaired by the&#13;
Permanent Secretary of MENR. The Vice-Chairman would be elected by the members of the&#13;
Committee from among its NGO/private sector representation. NESC membership would&#13;
comprise senior officials drawn from MENR, ECZ, implementing core line ministries, the&#13;
MOFED, PEF/SRP, NGOs, community representatives and the private sector. As a condition of&#13;
effectiveness, Government would establish the NESC for the program and would maintain the&#13;
NESC during the full implementation of ESP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-27-&#13;
4.4    An ESP Program Management Group (PMG) would be established as the coordinating&#13;
and decision-making body of the program. Chaired by the PID Director, it would act as the&#13;
secretariat of the NESC. It would comprise representatives of ESP executing agencies and, on a&#13;
rotational basis one district Environmental Facilitator. Representatives of the core line ministries&#13;
involved in the implementation of ESP activities would be called to participate as and when&#13;
required. The Program Management Group would meet monthly and have the following&#13;
responsibilities: coordination, review and consolidation of annual work programs and budgets;&#13;
and coordination of program implementation among the participating executing agencies.&#13;
4.5    At the district level, a District Environmental Committee would be established as a sub-&#13;
committee of the existing District Development Coordinating Committee. Membership of the&#13;
sub-committee would be determined on a district-by-district basis to include appropriate district&#13;
technical officers and the District Planning Officer or Director of Planning in urban areas. It&#13;
would be chaired by an elected representative of the district, with the Environmental Facilitator&#13;
as its Secretary. The Committee would focus on priority environmental and natural resource&#13;
concerns and assist the Environmental Facilitator to coordinate his/her activities in the district. It&#13;
would meet once a month and on an ad hoc basis as required. The Environmental Facilitator&#13;
would also be an advisor to the District Council.&#13;
Implementing Agency Responsibilities&#13;
4.6   The Environmental Council of Zambia (ECZ) would be directly responsible for&#13;
managing two components: the Environmental Education and Public Awareness (EEPA) and the&#13;
Environmental Information Network and Monitoring System (EINMS). The EEPA would be&#13;
managed by the Environmental Communication Unit of ECZ. An EINMS technical secretariat&#13;
coordinator, answerable directly to ECZ Director, would manage the EINMS component. The&#13;
detailed assignment of officers and staff would be decided by ECZ in consultation with PID.&#13;
4.7   The Legal Drafting Unit of the Ministry of Legal Affairs (MOLA) would oversee the&#13;
process of harmonizing the major environmental statutes and regulations for the Legal&#13;
Framework and Enforcement Capacity activity.&#13;
4.8   The Curriculum Development Center of the Ministry of Education would be responsible&#13;
for further developing the environmental content of school curriculum and work in close&#13;
collaboration with the ECZ Education and Communication Unit.&#13;
4.9   The Ministry of Local Government and Housing (MLG&amp;H) would work with PID and&#13;
ECZ to develop the ESP program in the districts and coordinate ongoing district initiatives. It&#13;
would work closely with them to detail the role and responsibilities of the Environmental&#13;
Facilitators in the context of the district administration and the District Councils.&#13;
4.10   The Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MOFED) would be responsible,&#13;
through its SRP management team, for the management and implementation of PEF's activities.&#13;
It would take advantage of the existing institutional setup and systems which have been&#13;
developed and proven in the implementation of the SRP over the past five years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
B. PHASING OF IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
4.11   ESP would represent the initial, five-year phase of a long-term program, to run over ten&#13;
to fifteen years, to support natural resource management, environmental conservation and&#13;
environmental protection. To ensure the efficient start up of the components, a number of&#13;
preliminary activities are being financed through a Program Preparation Facility (PPF). PPF&#13;
activities began in late 1996 and are expected to be implemented through 1997 with a view to:&#13;
(a) carry out the institutional assessment of the environmental apex institutions to better define&#13;
their functions and responsibilities; (b) confirm component operating procedures and preparing&#13;
necessary operational guidelines; and (c) initiate the procurement of essential goods and services&#13;
prior to the first year of program implementation.&#13;
4.12  ESP would adopt an evolutionary approach. The first year's work program is found in&#13;
the draft Program Implementation Plan. Subsequent years' activities would be fully developed&#13;
on the basis of annual implementation reviews, with the participation of key stakeholders. The&#13;
reviews would be used to determine both the content and the rate of expansion of component&#13;
programs in the coming year. A rate of program expansion would be adopted to allow sufficient&#13;
time to finalize procurement of goods and services, train personnel in procedures, increase public&#13;
awareness of the objectives and opportunities available through ESP, and build implementation&#13;
capacity among the various stakeholders. PID would receive annual procurement requests from&#13;
the various implementing agencies as part of the annual work plan and budget submissions.&#13;
C. COMPONENT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Institutional Strengthening and Legal Framework&#13;
4.13   The recommendations contained in the Institutional Assessment of the Environmental&#13;
Apex Units carried out in November 1996 would constitute the basis for a detailed review and&#13;
analysis, by the key participating organizations, of responsibilities for coordination and&#13;
management in the environmental sector. Under the institutional assessment process, to be&#13;
undertaken in the first year of ESP, more effective working procedures would be established for&#13;
the various organizations responsible for environmental planning and implementation.&#13;
4.14   The implementation of the institutional capacity building component would focus on&#13;
training and technical assistance, improvement of management/operating procedures and&#13;
systems development, and production of supporting management material. Assurances were&#13;
obtained at negotiations that by June 30, 1998 staff would be assigned in line ministries with the&#13;
appropriate qualifications and level of authority to establish and, thereafter, manage the&#13;
environmental focal points in the ministry.&#13;
4.15   The Community Environmental Management Program (see Annex 2) would enable&#13;
urban and rural communities to express their environmental needs and priorities, and to identify&#13;
activities or projects which they would like to undertake, but for which they would need&#13;
technical and/or financial assistance. It would also create an opportunity for government and&#13;
other interested parties to introduce new approaches for conservation or improvement of the&#13;
environment. This would be done through an interactive and participatory process focusing on&#13;
the development of community environmental action plans (CEAPs) incorporating participatory&#13;
environmental resource assessment. The CEAP would form the framework within which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-29-&#13;
assistance could be made available to the communities, either from the public or private sector.&#13;
Environmental Facilitators would assist communities to apply for support from ESP programs, in&#13;
particular, the PEF Community-Based Initiatives Fund and the environmental education&#13;
program. Equally important, the communities could use the CEAP to solicit support from donors&#13;
with projects in the area, or from other funding sources.&#13;
4.16   The community-oriented program would begin on a limited scale in two pilot districts&#13;
with provisions for expansion in the third year of the program to another seven districts. Each of&#13;
the selected districts would be in a different province. With only two initial districts, and a&#13;
limited number of communities in each district, the program would test different approaches in&#13;
partnership with the local communities, develop an experienced team of Environmental&#13;
Facilitators, train officers, develop operational manuals and training materials, and establish a&#13;
sound basis for expansion to other districts. As a condition of disbursement, Government would&#13;
make available the names, and the criteria used in the selection, of the two districts in which&#13;
Micro-Projects would be carried out during the first two years following the Effective Date.&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the criteria for selecting additional districts to be&#13;
included in the program, and the list of the selected districts, would be made available by&#13;
December 31, 1999.&#13;
4.17   The Environmental Facilitators, although contracted by MENR, would be seconded to&#13;
the respective District Councils to serve as focal points for all environmental initiatives in the&#13;
district including, but not restricted to, activities supported through ESP components. The&#13;
Facilitators would form an integral part of the District Council team. More specifically, they&#13;
would: (a) use participatory techniques to work with communities to help them develop the&#13;
action plans and carry out associated investment activities; (b) act as brokers for the communities&#13;
in establishing links with district technical staff, NGOs, donors and the private sector; (c) act as&#13;
catalysts for promoting environmental activities in the district; and d) bring together ESP&#13;
facilities and services to support environmental initiatives in the district.&#13;
4.18 The support provided under the Legal Framework and Enforcement Capacity activity&#13;
would focus on a small group of legal experts from MOLA and ECZ assisted, when needed, by&#13;
external consultants. Building on the recommendations of the NEAP and the detailed review&#13;
prepared for the ESP , the group of legal experts would develop a consensus regarding the gaps&#13;
to be filled, and the conflicts and disparities between laws, statutes, regulations and customary&#13;
laws. The group would propose draft revised laws, statutes and regulations. In order to ensure&#13;
the implementability and enforceability of the proposed drafts, the group would interact with all&#13;
ESP programs and stakeholders. The revised laws, statutes and regulations would be translated&#13;
into local languages for dissemination to communities. MOLA and ECZ would use training,&#13;
workshops and other participatory methods to develop a full understanding of the environmental&#13;
legislation and the associated rights and obligations.&#13;
Environmental Education and Public Awareness&#13;
4.19   Implementation of the component would follow two approaches. The first, to be&#13;
operated through the school system and the mass media, would provide a broad-based support to&#13;
raise awareness of environmental issues, principles and "best practices" among the general&#13;
GRZ/IUCN, ESP Technical Annex l-b, 'Legal Framework and Enforcement Capacity' July 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-&#13;
public. The second approach, to be implemented in conjunction with the Community&#13;
Environmental Management Program, would focus on developing local incentives for improved&#13;
environmental management.&#13;
4.20   ECZ would be the lead agency for this component and would work in close collaboration&#13;
with the Ministry of Education under the terms of a Memorandum of Understanding between&#13;
MENR/ECZ and the Ministry of Education. The primary implementation responsibility for the&#13;
Curriculum Review and Modification activity would be assumed by the Curriculum&#13;
Development Center with the technical support of the Education and Communication Unit of&#13;
ECZ.&#13;
Pilot Environmental Fund&#13;
4.21   While PID would have overall responsibility, the Social Recovery Project (SRP) would&#13;
be responsible for day-to-day management of PEF. To operate the PEF, a PEF Secretariat,&#13;
based in the SRP/Micro-Project Unit, would be established within the management structure of&#13;
the SRP, and the following staff appointed under the terms of reference specified in the&#13;
Operational Guidelines: an environmental specialist, a financial officer and a secretary, as&#13;
conditions of disbursement. Funding provisions would be made to furnish and equip the&#13;
Secretariat offices, provide a field vehicle for the coordinator, and enable the coordinator to&#13;
contract short-term consultants and services, as required, to assist with technical training and&#13;
systems installation as well as review of micro-project and study proposals.&#13;
4.22   A PEF/Micro-Project Unit (MPU) Steering Committee and a PEF/SRP Study Fund&#13;
Committee would be formed through expansion of the representation on the existing SRP&#13;
committees to include the ECZ focal person for ESP, PID's Chief Planning Officer, PEF's&#13;
Coordinator and others, as required. One of the Committee's main functions, once the program&#13;
is fully operational, would be to screen and approve applications for PEF funding. The&#13;
PEF/MPU Steering Committee and the PEF/SRP Study Fund Committee, which would meet&#13;
quarterly to review micro-project and study proposals, would be answerable to NESC for&#13;
environmental policy decisions affecting Fund adiiinistration and the technical aspects of&#13;
activities financed through the Fund. The proposed arrangement would minimize operational&#13;
costs during the early stages of ESP implementation, allow PEF to start operations with&#13;
minimum delay and assist in 'greening' the overall operations of SRP. Submission to IDA of&#13;
detailed Operational Guidelines of PEF procedures, including criteria of eligibility criteria for&#13;
micro-projects and studies, would be a condition of disbursement.&#13;
4.23   Given that SRP is an externally-financed facility which could be terminated prior to the&#13;
completion of ESP9, a study would be financed under the PEF component to explore the&#13;
advisability of establishing an independent PEF facility. This study, to be undertaken by the end&#13;
of project year 2, would focus on an evaluation of the organizational structure, implementation&#13;
arrangements and processes, and exploration of mechanisms to ensure PEF's long-term financial&#13;
sustainability.&#13;
4.24   The implementation of the PEF/Community Based Initiatives Fund would involve&#13;
close cooperation between the Micro-Projects Unit (MPU), which would manage the PEF fund&#13;
The completion date for the Second Social Recovery Project is June 30, 2000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31-&#13;
on behalf of ESP, and the district pilot programs led by the ESP-recruited Environmental&#13;
Facilitator. The Environmental Facilitators would assist communities to complete the&#13;
procedures necessary to access the Fund's matching grants to support eligible micro-projects.&#13;
These micro-projects would be identified through a participatory process led by local&#13;
organizations.&#13;
4.25   The approval process for the proposed PEF-fuinded micro-projects would be essentially&#13;
the same as that currently followed by the MPU. The main difference would be the availability&#13;
of technical reviewers to evaluate the environmental and economic/financial/technical soundness&#13;
of the proposed projects and the participation of the Environmental Facilitator in micro-project&#13;
appraisals and supervision. The PEF would maintain the MPU principle of securing&#13;
commitment from the participating community through their contribution of 25 percent of the&#13;
estimated cost of the micro-project in cash or kind, and their active support for their Community&#13;
Environmental Action Plan.&#13;
4.26   The PEF/Environmental Studies Fund would follow procedures similar to those&#13;
governing the studies fund of the SRP. Individual researchers or organizations could submit&#13;
proposals for studies either directly to the Secretariat or via the Environmental Facilitators. The&#13;
Research Adviser of SRP, together with two technical advisors, acting on behalf of the PEF&#13;
Secretariat, would then verify technical and economic viability and its eligibility and forward&#13;
proposals to the PEF/SRP Study Fund Committee for approval. The SRP Research Adviser, in&#13;
consultation with the PEF Coordinator, would contract the study reviewers to act as advisors to&#13;
successfuil applicants throughout the study period and to evaluate the results prior to the release&#13;
of the final payment. The same principles would be applied to applications related to the&#13;
development of major environmental strategies.&#13;
Environmental Information Network and Monitoring System&#13;
4.27   Design of the proposed EINMS is based on lessons learned and best practices in Africa.&#13;
Information management would be decentralized to a network of public and private institutions,&#13;
instead of being concentrated in a single agency. The institutions concerned with a specific&#13;
problem or issue would become key nodes of a specific information sub-system. Each institution&#13;
would establish and maintain its own information, corresponding to its specific mandate, while&#13;
having access to information created and maintained by the other members of the network.&#13;
Institutions would exchange information amongst themselves.&#13;
4.28   ECZ would host the EINMS technical secretariat. It would: (a) serve as the&#13;
coordinating unit for the EINMS Forum; (b) provide technical services to IDA-funded EINMS&#13;
activities, including the supervision of service contracts and quality control of products&#13;
delivered; (c) ensure the coherence of the different EINMS sub-systems; and (d) promote&#13;
linkages between the databases built by EINMS sub-systems and data collected by the&#13;
Community Environment Management Program using participatory techniques. Database&#13;
production, management and utilization would be entrusted to the individual EINMS sub-&#13;
systems. In particular, the EINMS technical secretariat would not itself produce, hold, manage&#13;
or distribute databases. Rather, it would serve as a referral system, indicating to potential users&#13;
where they could find the information they required. A coordinator would be hired to manage&#13;
the technical secretariat. The secretariat would also hire a GIS and Information Technology&#13;
expert to provide technical support and training. The majority of EINMS activities would be&#13;
sub-contracted to local consultants, in cooperation with international consultants, thus&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32-&#13;
encouraging the active participation of the local private sector and ensuring E1NMS&#13;
sustainability. These service contracts would be supplemented with efforts to strengthen specific&#13;
information centers within targeted user institutions.&#13;
4.29   To facilitate information sharing, EINMS would provide key network members with&#13;
access to electronic mail and, progressively, to full Internet service. This would facilitate the&#13;
functioning of the EINMS Forum as an information community. EINMS would also support the&#13;
preparation of World Wide Web pages related to EINMS activities, including a program&#13;
description, best practices, a catalogue of existing environmental databases, and a gateway to&#13;
environmental information.&#13;
4.30   The EINMS would take full account of other ongoing EIS development efforts at sub-&#13;
regional, national, provincial and district levels, to enhance complementarity and minimize&#13;
duplication of effort. The EINMS would also closely liaise with the Environmental Education&#13;
and Public Awareness component of the ESP to ensure that data holders adequately and&#13;
appropriately disseminate the information they generate to relevant user groups at the&#13;
community level. Similarly, the EINMS would work closely with PEF to provide data for&#13;
ongoing environmental research, as well as to improve EINMS applications through research.&#13;
D. MONITORING, EVALUATION, AND REPORTING&#13;
4.31   Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E). The M&amp;E system would function as a network,&#13;
with each implementing agency monitoring its components through its M&amp;E sub-system.&#13;
Implementing agencies would be linked among themselves for information sharing, and with the&#13;
system's hub for consolidation. Responsibility for this hub would rest with an M&amp;E cell within&#13;
PID, headed by an M&amp;E supervisor recruited on contract by PID and assisted by a database&#13;
officer. This supervisor would oversee information flows, including: (a) the establishment of&#13;
collection frames for performance indicators; (b) the assembly of data from M&amp;E sub-systems,&#13;
including fund disbursements and activity delivery reports, on a quarterly basis; and (c) the&#13;
production of consolidated quarterly reports for PMG.&#13;
4.32   Program progress reporting would take place semi-annually. Each implementing agency&#13;
would submit semi-annual reports to PID within four weeks of the end of the period, covering&#13;
progress, problems and issues by program component. The M&amp;E supervisor would integrate&#13;
these reports into a consolidated progress report.&#13;
4.33   For the purposes of program and government budgeting, PID would prepare and submit&#13;
to PMG an annual consolidated work plan, based on proposals made by implementing agencies.&#13;
It would include activity schedules and budgets. Once cleared by NESC, the work plan would be&#13;
submitted to IDA. At negotiations Government agreed that annual work programs and budgets&#13;
for the ESP, approved by NESC, would be provided to IDA and other participating donors by&#13;
December 31 of each year.&#13;
4.34  Independent program performance studies would be conducted every two years. These&#13;
studies would be based on: (a) a review of quarterly reports produced by PID, including an&#13;
analysis of performance indicators; (b) a baseline survey; and (c) an evaluation of the program's&#13;
impacts and effectiveness, including independently conducted beneficiary assessments. The&#13;
studies would evaluate the extent of progress in terms of fulfilling Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
objectives, program development objectives, expected program outputs, and program objectives&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-33-&#13;
of each ESP component (Institutional Strengthening and Legal Framework, Environmental&#13;
Education and Public Awareness, Pilot Environmental Fund, and Environmental Information&#13;
Management). They would specifically identify best practices, as well as constraints and critical&#13;
issues that must be addressed. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the Government&#13;
would contract an independent institution to carry out the bi-annual studies, beneficiary&#13;
consultations and performance analyses.&#13;
4.35   Mid-Term and Implementation Completion Reviews. Two reviews would be&#13;
conducted: the first at mid-term and the second just before completion. The mid-term review&#13;
would coincide with the end of the initial stage of the Community Environmental Management&#13;
Program, which is limited to two districts, and prior to its expansion to seven more districts.&#13;
Using the performance study conducted in project year 2, the program would be reviewed by&#13;
representatives from IDA, in cooperation with PID and the implementing agencies. The results&#13;
would be used to make any adjustments necessary to improve implementation performance and&#13;
development impact.&#13;
4.36   An Implementation Completion Review would cover program performance, output,&#13;
economic and social impact, and cost effectiveness, where this could be measured. The effects&#13;
and impacts of the program would be assessed through the beneficiary assessments carried out&#13;
under the PEF, the awareness surveys of the EEPA component, and the data collected under the&#13;
M&amp;E activity. Section II of the Implementation Completion Review would be prepared by PID&#13;
and submitted to IDA no later than six months after the credit closing date.&#13;
E. IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT&#13;
4.37  IDA implementation support to ESP would be intensive, particularly during the early&#13;
stages. The complexity of the decentralized implementation network, and the need to nurture the&#13;
development of MENR, would require inputs from persons with a broad range of environmental&#13;
expertise. In particular, extensive support would be needed during the first three years to&#13;
strengthen institutional capacity, establish EIA procedures, set up the EIS, and implement the&#13;
community mobilization and co-management activities. Furthermore, given the lack of prior&#13;
exposure to IDA procurement and disbursement regulations in the lead ministry, implementation&#13;
support missions should include expertise in these areas to ensure that the appropriate systems&#13;
are set up and correct procedures followed from the start of the program. The World Bank&#13;
Resident Mission in Lusaka would play a critical role in this effort, complemented by&#13;
13 supervision missions over the life of the program, including interim reviews, requiring an&#13;
estimated 100 staff weeks (see Annex 7). A minimum supervision time of 22 to 23 weeks per&#13;
year would be required during the first two years of the program, including a program launch&#13;
mission at the beginning of 1998, and three implementation support missions in each of the first&#13;
two years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-34-&#13;
5. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION&#13;
A. PROGRAM IMPACT&#13;
5.1   The program intends to build capacity and improve the management of environmental&#13;
resources by both the Government and the local communities in an effort to achieve sustainable&#13;
development. The benefits from the program will be several. First, ESP will allow the&#13;
Government to develop the national management capacity required to effectively implement and&#13;
monitor the priority actions identified in the NEAP. Second, by dovetailing with ongoing&#13;
activities, it will reinforce the environmental perspective of sectoral strategies and strengthen&#13;
institutions in their ability to implement programs and enforce legislations. Third, the program&#13;
will increase national and local awareness of the environmental consequences of economic&#13;
policies and actions by conducting environmental impact assessments and implementing&#13;
environmental awareness and education programs. Fourth, environmental management capacity&#13;
building at the district level will facilitate the integration of environmental concerns into overall&#13;
district development plans - an important priority as the decentralization process to the district&#13;
level gathers momentum in Zambia. Fifth, the program will establish a process by which local&#13;
communities will be empowered to achieve sustainable management of their natural resource&#13;
base and to take action, through a grant matching facility, to reverse local degradation and&#13;
improve the sustainable management of limited resources. Sixth, ESP will also bring a number&#13;
of indirect benefits such as improvement of health and quality of life. Finally, the experience&#13;
gained under ESP in environmental and natural resource management will be extended to other&#13;
districts not covered under this program, thus adding a potential benefit of replicability.&#13;
5.2    While the program is not a targeted poverty reduction initiative, the positive implications&#13;
for poverty reduction are substantial. Through its participatory Community Environmental&#13;
Management Program and the PEF facility, ESP will target the most vulnerable households (in&#13;
particular those headed by women) which are more likely to suffer from environmental&#13;
degradation. The program will assist in improving their situation, both by preserving natural&#13;
resources and by encouraging their better utilization. This, in turn, will generate direct economic&#13;
benefits. In addition, ESP will bring a number of indirect benefits to the poor segments of&#13;
society, such as improvements in health, and quality of life.&#13;
B. RISKS&#13;
5.3   Some of the challenges the program could encounter during implementation include:&#13;
(a)   resistance to MENR's role and coordination conflicts with sector ministries and&#13;
other participants. This risk has been addressed by holding joint working&#13;
sessions with officers of MENR and ECZ to ensure a clear understanding of their&#13;
functions and responsibilities; by involving major sector ministries and other&#13;
participants in the preparation of the NEAP and the ESP to develop a consensus;&#13;
and by designing the program to provide support to all stakeholders in&#13;
environmental protection and natural resource management;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-35-&#13;
(b)    difficulty in implementation due to the inherent complexity of this type of&#13;
environmentalprogram. This risk has been reduced by utilizing existing&#13;
institutions and proven processes; emphasizing the participation of communities&#13;
and districts, rather than central staff, in the planning and management of&#13;
environmental initiatives; developing specific operating agreements that&#13;
establish clear definitions of roles and responsibilities of institutions involved in&#13;
the program; and preparing an implementation plan based on lessons from&#13;
similar IDA/Bank financed programs;&#13;
(c)   failure of the Government to adopt and successfully implement a participatory&#13;
approach to strengthen environmental and natural resource management at the&#13;
district level. This risk has been mitigated by the Public Sector Reform Program&#13;
and the decentralization policy of which it forms a part; by the Local&#13;
Government Support Program and similar initiatives which aim to restructure&#13;
and strengthen the district administration; and by the increased emphasis by&#13;
donors, with support from local and international NGOs, on participatory,&#13;
demand-driven community development; and&#13;
(d)   failure of the Government to release timely and adequate counterpartfinancing.&#13;
This risk has been reduced by keeping incremental recurrent costs to a minimum&#13;
and by ensuring that the Government is fully aware of the nature and&#13;
implications of the expenditures which would occur. Assurance was obtained at&#13;
negotiations that GRZ would commit the necessary counterpart financing in its&#13;
annual budget.&#13;
C. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
5.4    The proposed program, which is largely directed toward institutional strengthening and&#13;
pilot programs, does not lend itself to detailed cost-benefit analysis and rate of return&#13;
calculations. Individual micro-projects at the local level could potentially be analyzed in&#13;
financial terms, after they have been identified by local communities through the Community&#13;
Environmental Management Program. By Mid-Term Review, it would be possible to evaluate&#13;
the types of projects being financed or those likely to be chosen in the future. The overall impact&#13;
of economic analysis would remain negligible since funding of micro-projects represents less&#13;
than 10 percent of total program investment.&#13;
D. SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
5.5    Several features of the program will help ensure its sustainability. First, the program has&#13;
a strong human resource development focus through which it will increase the capabilities of key&#13;
agencies to plan and monitor the sustainable use of environmental resources. Second, ESP will&#13;
operate through existing institutions and thus will not create new administrative structures.&#13;
Third, while some additional staff will be needed, in most cases staff are in place or positions&#13;
exist but have not yet been filled. Therefore, demand for new government staff will be limited.&#13;
Fourth, ESP's impact on recurrent costs will be kept to a minimum and progressively taken over&#13;
by the national budget. The total incremental recurrent costs for ESP of US$5.5 million&#13;
represents 26 percent of the overall costs. The Government's contribution to these costs,&#13;
US$2.1 million over the program life, will increase from US$0.1 million in the first year to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-36-&#13;
US$0.7 million in the fifth year, i.e., 15 percent to 50 percent of the incremental recurrent costs.&#13;
By that time, additional sources of funds will have been identified. These could include fees,&#13;
user charges, and increased community participation. Finally, by directly involving local&#13;
communities, it becomes possible to augment the limited support services and budget that the&#13;
Government can make available at district levels to sustainably manage the natural resource&#13;
base.&#13;

ZAMBIA&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL SUPPORT PROGRAM&#13;
Community Environmental Management Program&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    This Annex provides guidelines and an action plan for facilitating community&#13;
participation in environmental and natural resource management which would form a basis for&#13;
the identification. planning and implementation of local level activities within Zambia's&#13;
Environlmental Support Program (ESP).&#13;
2.     Environmenital and natural resource management is not and should not be viewed as the&#13;
sole prerogative of goverinmenit. the involvement and empowerment of the resource users&#13;
themselves is considered critical to the success of any environmental initiative. Furthermore,&#13;
reliance on public or private sector law enforcement (often regarded as an alternative to&#13;
community participation) is costly, inefficient and unsustainable. Experience worldwide has&#13;
demonistrated that environmental management must be tackled as a joint venture between the&#13;
genieral public and goverilnmeit. These principles have governed the design of support for&#13;
promoting comimlunlity involvement under ESP.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
3.     The ESP aims to pilot a Community Environmental Management Program designed to&#13;
develop mechianlisimis for involvinig rural and urban communities in environmental planning,&#13;
decision-miiakinig and implementation. The program would raise community awareness of&#13;
environimilental issues and, over time, develop community capacity to assume responsibility for&#13;
lhe efficient, sustainable use of the resource base and the facilities and basic services it sustains.&#13;
4.     To meet these overall objectives, the program would seek to: (a) assist in the creation of&#13;
an enablinig environment at the national level for active community participation in&#13;
environmienital issues: (b) strengthen the technical and financial capacity of rural and urban&#13;
communities to deal with environmental matters at the local level and on their own behalf; (c)&#13;
strengthien operational capacity in the major organizations associated with the environment&#13;
(public sector -- especially at the district level -- SRP. NGOs, community-based organizations&#13;
and the private sector): and (d) assist in the development and implementation of a series of&#13;
simple Community Environmental Action Plans (CEAP).&#13;
Approach&#13;
5.     Rather than setting out a single blueprint for mobilizing a large number of communities,&#13;
the Community Environmental Management Program would initially test and develop&#13;
techniques on a limited scale to help communities in selected pilot districts to design their&#13;
respective CEAPs. The CEAPs would form the framework within which a series of small-scale,&#13;
community-based environmental initiatives could be financed through the Pilot Environmental&#13;
Fund (PEF) and/or other relevant sources. Experience gained under the pilot program would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 2 of 12&#13;
enable the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MENR) and other collaborating&#13;
government and non-government agencies at national, provincial and district levels to:&#13;
(a) determine how best to identify, design, implement and monitor programs and projects in&#13;
partnership with local communities; and (b) establish a sound basis for subsequent program&#13;
expansion.&#13;
6.    The establishment of an environmental presence at the district level would be central to&#13;
this process. Under the program, a new district level position of Environmental Facilitator&#13;
would be piloted in one district in each of the nine provinces in Zambia. The facilitators, who&#13;
would be trained in participatory methods, would be contracted by MENR and assigned as&#13;
technical advisers on the environment to the respective District Councils. District Council&#13;
representatives would assist the MENR, ECZ, SRP and MLG&amp;H in drawing up Terms of&#13;
Reference for the facilitators. These would, inter alia, define facilitators' accountability, duties&#13;
and reporting responsibilities. The Districts Councils would participate fully in the recruitment&#13;
of their respective facilitators who would serve as the focal point for all environmental initiatives&#13;
in a district including, but not restricted to, activities supported through ESP components. More&#13;
specifically, they would: (a) be involved in the participatory process through which&#13;
communities would develop their CEAPs; (b) act as a broker for the communities in establishing&#13;
links with district technical staff, NGOs, donors and the private sector; (c) act as a catalyst for&#13;
environmental activities in the district; and (d) bring together ESP facilities and services in&#13;
support of environmental initiatives in the district, in particular, those available under the PEF&#13;
and Environmental Education and Public Awareness (EEPA) components. Facilitators would&#13;
receive regular training to improve work performance and update their skills based on lessons&#13;
learned through ESP and in programs elsewhere in the region.&#13;
7.    The facilitators for the initial two pilot districts would be contracted in project year 1.&#13;
Tlhe remaining facilitators would be recruited at the end of project year 1 and trained by working&#13;
alongside their colleagues in the two initial districts throughout project year 2. Once trained,&#13;
they would begin operations in their respective districts. The actual rate of program expansion&#13;
from project year 3 onwards would be determined during Mid-Term Review.&#13;
Participatory Community-Based Planning Process&#13;
8.    The design of the proposed process takes into account existing, albeit limited, experience&#13;
of engaging communities in environmental management in Zambia, and experience with similar&#13;
programs operating elsewhere in the region. The process is intended to permit flexibility in&#13;
implementation and may be adapted and modified as experience of working with communities&#13;
grows and the knowledge and understanding of Zambia's environment deepens.&#13;
9.    In the initial year of developing the Community Environmental Management Program,&#13;
pilot communities would be selected in which environmental concerns, particularly those&#13;
identified in the NEAP, are known to be pre-eminent. In such cases, the process of CEAP&#13;
preparation and micro-project identification would begin with a participatory 'environmental&#13;
needs assessment' in which attention would focus from the outset on natural resource and&#13;
environmental management. The process would involve a sequence of defined steps, although&#13;
local variants would be expected to emerge as dictated by location-specific circumstances.&#13;
10.   Step 1 - District Selection. The program requires early successes in order to build&#13;
credibility and stimulate other communities to participate. The program would select the pilot&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 3 of 12&#13;
districts on the basis of a core set of technical and social criteria including association with one&#13;
or more of the key environmental problems identified in the NEAP - water pollution, air&#13;
pollution, deforestation, land degradation, wildlife depletion; level of poverty; and health and&#13;
nutritional status. These would be developed by MENRJPID and ECZ in consultation with the&#13;
other institutions to be represented in the ESP Program Management Group. Additional criteria,&#13;
such as the presence of motivated and interested district line officials, the presence of interested&#13;
communities and traditional leaders, likelihood of success, and accessibility, would be used to&#13;
guide the final selection.&#13;
11.   Step 2 - Launch of the Community Environmental Management Program in the&#13;
District. The Environmental Facilitator would be responsible for coordinating launch&#13;
workshops for district council and line ministry officials, NGOs, church groups, traditional&#13;
leaders, and interested members of the private sector. These workshops would aim to inform&#13;
participants of ESP objectives, its components and the opportunities it presents, and involve&#13;
them in developing the Program in their districts. One of the outputs of these workshops would&#13;
be to develop an agreed set of criteria to aid the selection of communities in the district.&#13;
12.   Step 3 - Selection of Participating Communities. Using the recommendations of the&#13;
launch workshops as a basis, the Environmental Facilitator would work closely with the district&#13;
administration as well as traditional leadership to identify four initial communities. These&#13;
communities will have recognized the need for action in environmental control/management and&#13;
will have expressed an interest in accessing resources for environment-related investment. For&#13;
overall program planning purposes, it has been assumed that four new communities would&#13;
become engaged under the program in each district in each year of the ESP. Implementation&#13;
experience may suggest a need to modify the assumed rate of expansion.&#13;
13.   Step 4 - Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) Training and the Development of&#13;
CEAPs. International Environmental/PRA Specialists would train a suitably qualified Zambian&#13;
national team in a wide range of environmental and natural resource management issues and&#13;
adapted PRA techniques suited to use in urban as well as rural communities. With the assistance&#13;
of the facilitator, the national team would develop participatory appraisal skills among local&#13;
NGOs (where available), local line ministry officials and other individuals as appropriate&#13;
(teachers, community leaders, community facilitators, businessmen). Initial theoretical training&#13;
would be followed by practical, field-based training (learning by doing) while carrying out the&#13;
first community environmental needs assessment. Trained local groups would carry out&#13;
subsequent needs assessments in a district with further training and support from the national&#13;
team as necessary. Environmental Facilitators would help guide the assessments, particularly in&#13;
the early stages of the program. The national PRA team would initiate similar training processes&#13;
in other districts under ESP in accordance with the phased expansion of the Community&#13;
Environmental Management Program.&#13;
14.   The environmental needs assessment would lead to the preparation of a CEAP within&#13;
which a number of priority investment requirements may be identified. The Environmental&#13;
Facilitator would act as a broker, helping communities to contact appropriate sources of support,&#13;
such as the PEF, EEPA, SRP, programs of sector ministries at district level, and the Rural&#13;
Investment Fund. An indicative list of the types of micro-projects which may be considered for&#13;
PEF financing is given in Attachment 1. In guiding the communities, the ESP program would&#13;
avoid duplication and competition between different funding sources by reference to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 4 of 12&#13;
eligibility criteria of the respective funds. Proposed eligibility criteria for the PEF/Community-&#13;
Based Initiatives Fund are given in Attachment 2&#13;
15.   The Environmental Facilitator would help communities wishing to apply for PEF&#13;
matching-grants to meet necessary pre-qualification conditions, complete funding applications&#13;
and submit micro-project proposals to the PEF Secretariat (Attachment 3). During the initial&#13;
pilot phase, the PEF Coordinator would assist in the district level desk and field appraisals of&#13;
potential micro-projects. Where required, funds would be made available from PEF resources to&#13;
refine the technical and investment plans of micro-projects. The process from micro-project&#13;
appraisal to matching-grant approval by the PEF/MPU Steering Committee would take no longer&#13;
than 6 months. More than one micro-project could be eligible for funding in each CEAP.&#13;
Potential micro-projects would be prioritized by the communities and their implementation&#13;
phased taking into account communities' implementation capacity.&#13;
16.   Step 5 - CEAP Implementation. A key pre-qualification requirement for communities&#13;
to receive a PEF matching grant would be the establishment of a Micro-Project Committee to&#13;
manage the activities on behalf of the community and operate a bank account for the micro-&#13;
project. The Committee may elect to manage its own activities or to contract services from a&#13;
locally-based NGO or other local specialist(s) to provide technical and/or other services. The&#13;
facilitator would assist as necessary with arranging the contracts. Subsequently, both the&#13;
Committee and the facilitator would monitor project implementation progress. The facilitator&#13;
would assist communities to access additional technical assistance as required and, together with&#13;
a contracted local technical team appointed by the District Council, evaluate the project upon&#13;
completion. On an annual basis, the CEMP review would incorporate beneficiary assessments of&#13;
micro-project impact and the effectiveness of the participatory environmental management&#13;
process as a contribution to the overall management information system of ESP.&#13;
Benefits of the Community Program&#13;
17.   Implementation of the Community Environmental Management Program and the&#13;
experience gained in developing participatory environmental methods would have benefits at&#13;
community, district and national levels as follows:&#13;
* Community Capacity Building. The formation of Micro-Project Committees which manage&#13;
their own funds, and communities' collaboration with NGOs and other local experts in&#13;
solving environmental problems, would be expected to raise environmental awareness and&#13;
improve financial and technical management skills at the local level. This in turn would&#13;
increase communities' confidence and ability to tackle other community problems. Training&#13;
of the Micro-Project Committees in accounting procedures would give communities an&#13;
opportunity to manage their funds effectively and responsibly. In the longer term, such&#13;
experience could allow the feasibility of creating Community Development Funds to be&#13;
explored;&#13;
* District Capacity Building. Elected district officials, line ministry representatives, NGOs,&#13;
and the private sector would participate in the environmental/natural resource management&#13;
and PRA training on the district level. They would also take part in PRAs in their districts in&#13;
collaboration with the Environmental Facilitators. This would increase the level of&#13;
environmental awareness in the district and develop the technical environmental skills of&#13;
district technicians from both the private and public sectors. These skills and experiences&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 5 of 12&#13;
could be drawn upon in future phases of ESP for promoting the expansion of similar&#13;
programs within their own districts as well as in other districts; and&#13;
National Level Benefits. The Community Environmental Management Program would help&#13;
keep MENR and ECZ in touch with environmental and natural resource management&#13;
problems and concerns as perceived by communities. In addition, the program will begin the&#13;
process of gradual transfer of responsibility for environmental and natural resource&#13;
management from government to the user, thus reducing the burden on government and&#13;
facilitating sustainable management of the environment. The experiences gained through the&#13;
program during the initial phase of ESP would provide a sound basis on which MENR could&#13;
plan participatory environmental programs on a broader front in subsequent phases of ESP.&#13;
As part of the ESP 1 review of the effectiveness of community-based initiatives and in support&#13;
of ESP2 preparation, MENR would be in a position to conduct a series of policy review&#13;
workshops. The workshops would bring together representatives of Micro-Project&#13;
Committees, district administration, national policy makers, national and international NGOs&#13;
and technical experts to discuss their conclusions on the participatory processes tested and&#13;
developed through the community program. The workshop output would be to recommend&#13;
future directions for the private/public sector partnership in environmental and natural&#13;
resource management. Community program implementation experience and workshop&#13;
recommendations would serve as the basis for designing further legislative and policy&#13;
reforms. Finally, the availability of environmental skills within its management structure&#13;
would enable SRP to consider environmental activities in developing its programs with&#13;
communities in the ESP pilot districts.&#13;

PEF Eligibility Criteria&#13;
Eligibility Criteria for the Community Based Initiatives Fund&#13;
The eligibility criteria are defined to encompass initiatives which tackle natural resource and&#13;
environmental problems in rural and urban communities. During the process of CEAP&#13;
preparation, environmental facilitators would orient the communities to the PEF operational&#13;
guidelines and eligibility criteria for financing, and would assist communities to develop&#13;
proposals which fulfill the criteria. The PEF would consider proposals for matching grants to&#13;
support community-based micro-projects which:&#13;
* are technically in line with the priority natural resource and environmental management&#13;
concerns guiding ESP and identified through the National Environmental Action Plan;&#13;
* promote the sustainable management of natural resources and/or environment in either the&#13;
short- or long-term;&#13;
* tackle natural resource and/or environmental problems and priorities which have been clearly&#13;
identified as part of the CEAP preparation process; are consistent with district environmental&#13;
priorities; and have been endorsed by the District Environmental Committee, District&#13;
Development Coordinating Committee and the District Council;&#13;
* are technically feasible given the circumstances of the applying community;&#13;
* demonstrate that the micro-project will benefit the poor and other vulnerable groups;&#13;
* have a direct economic benefit;&#13;
* are cost effective;&#13;
* are submitted by a Micro-Project Committee which has been specially established with an&#13;
elected Chairman, Treasurer, and Secretary, and a membership in which men and women are&#13;
equally represented;&#13;
* demonstrate the community's commitment to, and ownership of, the micro-project through its&#13;
willingness to pay some 25% of the associated costs, either in labor, kind or cash. The&#13;
proportion to be contributed by the community may vary according to the nature of the&#13;
activity but would be worked out with the community during micro-project design;&#13;
* demonstrate that the majority of the community and future beneficiaries&#13;
recognize the importance of the long-term sustainability of the micro-project by committing&#13;
themselves to setting up a Community Maintenance Committee before micro-project&#13;
completion. The costs of future operation and maintenance would be the full responsibility of&#13;
the community; and&#13;
* require funding support from a PEF matching-grant not exceeding US$20,000. More&#13;
typically, a micro-project is expected to cost in the order of US$5,000 - 10,000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
Page 10 of 12&#13;
Eligibility Criteria for the Environmental Study Fund&#13;
The Environmental Study Fund is designed to support several levels of investigation from&#13;
national environmental strategy development and environmental program/policy review to&#13;
small-scale studies of more localized interest. Studies and surveys eligible to be considered for&#13;
financing through the PEF/Environmental Studies Fund would be expected to contribute to one&#13;
or more of the following:&#13;
* research (studies and surveys) and environmental impact assessments arising from the CEMP&#13;
and designed to complement micro-projects;&#13;
* identification and/or implementation of techniques and actions which would increase&#13;
communities' sustainable use and improved management of natural resources, either as a&#13;
complement to CEAP implementation in the ESP pilot districts, or which are independently&#13;
derived from elsewhere in the country;&#13;
* furthering the understanding of environmental processes at work in Zambia;&#13;
* furthering the understanding of how the poor and other vulnerable groups are affected by&#13;
environmental degradation and/or pollution and suggest solutions for dealing with the&#13;
problem;&#13;
* a reduction in the risk of natural disasters (e.g., droughts, floods, pest infestation, etc.);&#13;
* design of medium- to long-term strategies of national importance such as drought&#13;
preparedness, biodiversity and renewable energy;&#13;
* identification of mechanisms for ensuring the long-term sustainability of PEF; updating the&#13;
National Environmental Action Plan; and initiating preparation of the second ESP; and&#13;
* prevention or mitigation of environmental emergencies, either through contributing to an&#13;
understanding of the cause of the emergency or developing action plans for dealing with the&#13;
emergency.&#13;
Studies and surveys should be designed to have a practical, problem-solving orientation rather&#13;
than being of solely academic interest, and should have adequate justification in terms of&#13;
technical feasibility and economic viability. Study proposals must indicate how the anticipated&#13;
results would be widely disseminated in a form understandable to and usable by communities, as&#13;
well as by decision makers at district or national level.&#13;

Attachment 3&#13;
THE PEF CYCLE OF MICRO-PROJECT FINANCING&#13;
Submission and Review of Micro-Project Proposals&#13;
Through its association with the Environmental Facilitators assigned in the pilot districts, PEF&#13;
would have the advantage of being linked to district administrations and the functions of the&#13;
District Council and the District Development Coordination Committee (DDCC). Micro-projects&#13;
supported by the Fund would be initiated by communities through the participatory planning&#13;
processes of the Community Environmental Management Program (CEMP) under ESP, with&#13;
support from district level technical and administrative staff. The PEF would complement the&#13;
community-based planning process and strengthen district administrations' capacity to respond&#13;
to communities' identified investment needs in environmental and natural resource management,&#13;
thereby contributing to the Government's decentralization effort.&#13;
On completion of a Community Environmental Action Plan (CEAP), and following the&#13;
identification of priority investment activities for implementation within the CEAP framework,&#13;
the community must establish a Micro-Project Committee to be responsible for micro-project&#13;
implementation. The Committee would have an elected Chairman, Treasurer and Secretary.&#13;
Equal gender representation on the committee would be attempted. Once this pre-condition has&#13;
been met, the community would initiate the project cycle.&#13;
Micro-project proposals which arise from the CEAP and are potentially eligible for financing&#13;
under the PEF, would be subject to monitoring procedures similar to those applied under the&#13;
SRP. Proposals would include a description of the activity, information on the expected benefits&#13;
and beneficiaries, and initial cost estimates. Matching-grant applications would be subject to an&#13;
initial screening through a desk appraisal organized at district level by the Environmental&#13;
Facilitator as Secretary of the District Environment Committee, and submitted to the Desk&#13;
Appraisal Committee (Planning Sub-Committee) of the DDCC. The desk appraisal would be&#13;
followed by an intensive field appraisal to assess technical feasibility and verify the&#13;
community's commitment and state of preparation for project implementation. Where possible,&#13;
the field appraisal by the district team would also involve the SRP Regional Officer and a&#13;
member of the Provincial Planning Unit. Successful proposals would be forwarded on behalf of&#13;
the community to the PEF Secretariat by the Environmental Facilitator. At each stage of&#13;
appraisal, copies of documentation would be forwarded to PEF/MPU to enable the PEF&#13;
Coordinator to monitor the review process.&#13;
At the level of the PEF Secretariat, proposals would be reviewed internally by the PEF&#13;
Coordinator together with the coordinator of the Community Environmental Management&#13;
Program in PID and the ECZ officer assigned as the focal point for ESP. Additional technical&#13;
specialists would be contracted to assist in the review if warranted by the nature of the micro-&#13;
project. On an exceptional basis, the review could include a site visit to gather any further&#13;
information not included in the request form.' Proposals would be fully costed in order to&#13;
Site visits from headquarters would ordinarily be restricted to micro-projects which had already been&#13;
approved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNFX 2&#13;
Page 12 of 12&#13;
determine the requisite level of community contribution - normally not less than 25 percent.2&#13;
Following Secretariat review, proposals would be submitted to the PEF/MPU Steering&#13;
Committee for final approval. The Steering Committee would meet on a quarterly basis to&#13;
review funding applications. The process from the submission of applications by the&#13;
environmental facilitator to approval by the Steering Committee would take no longer than 6&#13;
months.&#13;
For a proposal that is approved, a contract would be signed between the community and the PEF&#13;
and a copy forwarded to the Planning and Information Department/MENR for information. The&#13;
PEF Coordinator, through the relevant Environmental Facilitator, would arrange for a micro-&#13;
project launch workshop in the community to confirm details of implementation arrangements&#13;
and the community's associated responsibilities.&#13;
Conditions of Matching-Grant Disbursement&#13;
Communities must demonstrate their financial and/or material commitment to their micro-&#13;
project(s) prior to formal submission and approval. Where communities have elected to&#13;
implement activities through contractual arrangements with an NGO or other local experts,&#13;
contracts must be established in principle, subject to confirmation following micro-project&#13;
approval by the PEF/MPU Steering Committee.&#13;
The Micro-Project Committee would be required to establish a community bank account&#13;
(generally at district level) controlled under the joint signatures of the Committee Chairman and&#13;
Treasurer. Accounting procedures of the Committee must be fully transparent at the community&#13;
level. Following the signature of the micro-project contract, an initial installment of 30 percent&#13;
of the PEF matching grant would be transferred to the community account. Later disbursement&#13;
would be in equal tranches effected only after 75 percent of the previous allocations have been&#13;
justified with receipts. The fourth and last allocation would be disbursed after an estimate has&#13;
been made of any remaining works.&#13;
Micro-Project Completion&#13;
The Environmental Facilitator would confirm physical completion of the micro-project and the&#13;
financial controller in the PEF Secretariat would certify that the micro-project has justified 100&#13;
percent of the allocations made for its implementation. The facilitator would maintain close&#13;
supervision of the micro-project throughout the implementation period. On average, the PEF&#13;
Secretariat would also carry out three supervision visits to a given micro-project and arrange a&#13;
follow-up visit to assess micro-project impact six months after completion. Micro-projects would&#13;
be closed if there is any misuse of funds or a lack of community commitment or contribution.&#13;
Should a problem develop in the financing of a micro-project, communities would be given&#13;
every chance to pay back misspent funds and/or to reduce targets so that the community may&#13;
benefit from at least part of the micro-project.&#13;
Different levels of contribution may be agreed with communities depending upon the nature of the&#13;
activity and subject to approval by the SRF/PEF Steering Committee.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Environmental Support Project will
            support the Government's development strategy of
            poverty reduction within the framework of economic growth
            and protection of the environment and national resources.
            The program aims to mainstream environmental and natural
            resources management in Zambia's development processes
            at the national and local levels. The program will have four
            major components: a) institutional strengthening and legal
            framework as well as piloting a community environmental
            management program; b) environmental education and public
            awareness (EEPA); c) pilot environmental fund (PEF) to
            instigate an incentive mechanism, promote community-based
            microprojects, finance studies and develop action plans and
            strategies; and d) environmental information management
            supporting the establishment of an Environmental Information
            Network and Monitoring System (EINMS) and a monitoring,
            evaluation and reporting system as a management tool for project.
