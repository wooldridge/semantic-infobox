     Project Background:&#13;
     Deepening the Afghan financial system and fostering financial inclusion are key pillars for sustainable growth and development. The â&#128;&#156;Access to Finance Project&#13;
     â&#128;&#156;contributes to strengthening the institutional capacity of the sector. It builds on WBGâ&#128;&#153;s successful engagement in the development of the microfinance sector in&#13;
     Afghanistan since 2003 when the Microfinance Investment Support Facility for Afghanistan (MISFA) was established. This project is implemented by MISFA and the&#13;
     Ministry of Finance, to support and complements the government of Afghanistanâ&#128;&#153;s efforts to implement a fully-fledged financial sector development strategy that&#13;
     focuses on increasing access to finance for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).&#13;
&#13;
     Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:&#13;
     To build institutional capacity to improve access to credit of MSMEs. Key component include:&#13;

&#13;
Project Background:&#13;
Limited access to quality inputs at affordable prices is a key constraint to higher agricultural productivity in Afghanistan. The agricultural inputs delivery network&#13;
remains underdeveloped, weakly regulated, and distorted, requiring investments and action at the institutional, policy and farm levels.&#13;
The project will build institutional capacity in the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation (MAIL) required for overseeing input quality control, safety and&#13;
reliability, and availability.&#13;
It will support the infrastructure and human resources needed to exercise and enforce quality control for fertilizers and other agro-chemicals, and improve functioning&#13;
and transition of the seed sector toward a market for certified wheat seed with minimal external support.&#13;
&#13;
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:&#13;
The project objective is to strengthen institutional capacity for the safety and reliability of agricultural inputs and the sustainable production of certified wheat seed.&#13;
&#13;
Components are:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Improved Wheat Seed Production supports (i) varietal selection and production of breeder seed; (ii) production of foundation and registered seed; and (iii)&#13;
       coordination of the seed sector.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Plant Quarantine Networks and Quality Control of Agro-chemicals supports enhancement of MAIL capacity to implement the quality control of agro-chemicals,&#13;
       including: (i) establishment of an office for pesticides registration; (ii) construction of various laboratories; (iii) provision of pesticide bio-efficacy trial equipment;&#13;
       and (iv) strengthening the fertilizer quality control inspection system.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Input Delivery Systems supports the analysis of the recipientâ&#128;&#153;s current agricultural input delivery systems and assists in the development of an action plan for&#13;
       investment activities in inputs delivery systems.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Project Management and Monitoring supports management and monitoring of the project.&#13;
Results Achieved:&#13;
AAIP has technically and financially supported MAIL and its relevant directorates in production of breeder, foundation, and certified wheat seeds based on improved&#13;
production practices. The project has also completed the survey and design for establishment of 13 laboratory complexes for the Plant Protection and Quarantine&#13;
Directorate and designs for 10 Border Quarantine Stations. The project also has completed the survey and design of nine Regional Research Stations, and four Regional&#13;
Seed Production Farms. All this work will inform the future investments by the project as well as by the ministry in these areas. The project also provided in-country&#13;
training for 313 staff members of Agriculture Research Institute of Afghanistan (ARIA), Improved Seeds Enterprise Plant Protection and Quarantine Directorate. The&#13;
international training, including masters and PhD programs for the ministryâ&#128;&#153;s target staff, are in progress.&#13;

&#13;
     Project Background:&#13;
     Two decades of civil war severely damaged the Afghan road network at all levels: regional and national highways, provincial roads, and local access roads. Prolonged&#13;
     conflict denied most of the rural population access to essential social services including markets, health centers, schools, and government offices.&#13;
     Formulated in 2002, the National Emergency Employment Program funded short-term employment through restoration of the dilapidated rural infrastructure. This&#13;
     initiative evolved into the National Rural Access Program from 2005, with a strong focus on the provision of year-round rural access to basic social services.&#13;
     More than 11,000 kilometers (km) of rural roads and related drainage structures have been upgraded or rehabilitated under these programs through four projects&#13;
     financed through IDA, ARTF, and other funds.&#13;
&#13;
     Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:&#13;
     The objective of the Afghanistan Rural Access Project is to enable rural communities to benefit from all-season road access to basic services and facilities. Components&#13;
     are:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Improvement and maintenance of secondary roads: Supports rehabilitation of about 1,000 km roads, 250 km of upgrading existing pavement to bituminous&#13;
            standard, about 1,000 km of routine and periodic maintenance of paved and unpaved secondary roads, and construction of about 1,000 linear meters of bridges.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Improvement and maintenance of tertiary roads: Will support about 1,300 km of rehabilitation and 2,000 km of routine and periodic maintenance of tertiary&#13;
            roads, and construction of about 1,600 linear meters of bridges.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Program planning and development, institutional strengthening and program coordination support: Will support human resource and institutional capacity&#13;
            building, program monitoring and evaluation, and program development activities.&#13;
     Results Achieved:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Construction of 410 km of secondary gravel roads, 105 km of secondary asphalt roads, and 880 linear meters of secondary bridges.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Construction of 900 km of tertiary roads and 1,050 linear meters of tertiary bridges.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Routine maintenance of 1,032 secondary road and periodic maintenance of 132 km of secondary road.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Routine maintenance of 3,250 km of tertiary road and periodic maintenance of 500 km of tertiary road.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Project Background:&#13;
Over 75 percent of the Afghan population lives in rural areas where agriculture is the primary activity and contributes about one-third of GDP. But poor governance,&#13;
weak factor markets, inadequate marketing infrastructure, ineffective business development services, and poor post-harvest practices limit the development potential&#13;
of this sector.&#13;
&#13;
The Afghanistan Rural Enterprise Development Project aims to ensure the social, economic, and political well being of rural communities, especially the poor and the&#13;
most vulnerable, while stimulating the integration of rural communities within the economy.&#13;
&#13;
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:&#13;
The overall development objective of the project is to improve employment opportunities and income of rural men and women, and the sustainability of targeted local&#13;
enterprises. Components are:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Community-led enterprise development: Creates savings groups, enterprise groups, and village savings and loans associations. These institutions are assisted in&#13;
       building their own capacities, increasing the value of trade, ensuring production is oriented towards identified market opportunities, and creating access to credit&#13;
       through internal lending.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) development: Supports the emergence of a stronger SME sector with improved trading linkages with the rural econ-&#13;
       omy and adequate access to financial services. The project finances a sequenced approach for SME support, i.e. identifying key value chains in each province,&#13;
       working with the stakeholders to identify choke points constricting growth, identifying opportunities for value chain linkages and defining skill gaps.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Project implementation support: Project management, monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
Results Achieved:&#13;
The project has so far established 5,561 saving groups (52 percent female), 415 Village Saving and Loan Associations (VSLAs), 1,238 Enterprise Groups (65 percent&#13;
female), and has supported 563 (13 percent female) SMEs.&#13;
&#13;
 A total of six Provincial Situations Analysis (PSA) are completed and 10 PSAs are underway. A total 113 Kochies and 143 disabled were supported to enhance their&#13;
enterprise development skills and productivity. As whole, more than 60,000 direct and indirect jobs created through the above achievements.&#13;

&#13;
     Project Background:&#13;
     A coordinated funding mechanism to support Afghan reconstruction is essential to help the country return to normalcy.&#13;
&#13;
     Such an instrument needs to be aligned with national priorities, should promote transparency and accountability of reconstruction assistance, and reinforce the&#13;
     national budget as the primary policy instrument.&#13;
&#13;
     The international community and the Afghan government have recognized that the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) should be used to fund the essential&#13;
     recurrent costs required for the government to function effectively&#13;
&#13;
     Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:&#13;
     The objective of the recurrent cost component of the ARTF is to provide a coordinated financing mechanism enabling the Afghan government to make predictable,&#13;
     timely, and accurate payments for approved recurrent costs related to salaries and wages of civil servants, and non-security related government operating and&#13;
     maintenance expenditures.&#13;
     Components are:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Reimbursements of civil servant salaries: Establish an amount via grant renewals for reimbursement of civilian expenditures. With the assistance of a third party&#13;
            monitoring agent, the government submissions are then reviewed to determine that these have met the eligibility criteria.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Reimbursement of operating and maintenance costs: Establish an amount via grant renewals for reimbursement of civilian expenditures. With the assistance of&#13;
            a third party monitoring agent, the government submissions are then reviewed to determine that these have met the eligibility criteria.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Incentive program: Introduced in 2009, it refers to a series of policy actions and revenue benchmarks agreed to between the World Bank and the government&#13;
            that align with development priorities and which, if attained, entitle the government to an agreed amount of additional funding for the first two components.&#13;
     Results Achieved:&#13;
     Over 13 years, the project disbursed nearly $3.5 billion against legitimate recurrent costs in a timely fashion.&#13;
&#13;
     This represents 20 percent of civilian recurrent costs in the period, and the process provided an opportunity for donors to conduct monitoring of all civilian costs for&#13;
     adherence to financial and eligibility standards.&#13;
&#13;
     The incentive component led to significant reforms in revenue generation, public-sector governance, and private-sector development.&#13;

&#13;
Project Background:&#13;
The Capacity Building for Results Facility (CBR) is a key ARTF investment that supports the government in developing its internal human capacity, organizational&#13;
structures, and functions over the medium term to improve service delivery to the population. It is demand driven with ministries required to meet certain criteria to&#13;
participate.&#13;
A CBR ministry must develop a comprehensive reform plan (to be implemented with existing donor and government resources) with a results framework to which it&#13;
is held accountable.&#13;
CBR enables a ministry to hire skilled Afghans into civil service positions at more competitive rates.&#13;
&#13;
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:&#13;
The projectâ&#128;&#153;s development objective is to assist the government in improving the capacity and performance of select line ministries in carrying out their mandates and&#13;
delivering services to the Afghan people.&#13;
&#13;
Components are:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Technical Assistance Facility for preparation and implementation of CBR programs: Provides technical assistance to the participating ministries.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Developing human resources: Supports the continued implementation of broad civil service reform efforts and placement of critical managerial and professional&#13;
       staff resources in participating line ministries.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Civil service training: Intends to create partnerships between the Afghanistan Civil Service Institute and reputable international institutions to: (i) develop custom-&#13;
       made public administration management training programs for civil servants in managerial positions and for management interns; (ii) deliver the training&#13;
       programs; and (iii) develop faculty capacity at the Afghanistan Civil Service Institute.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Project management, monitoring and evaluation: Focuses on overall project management, monitoring and reporting, and consultancy services for appraisal and&#13;
       review of implementation progress and results of CBR programs.&#13;
Results Achieved:&#13;
The ministries of Agriculture and Communications were approved as the first top tier ministries, enabling them to recruit a substantial number of skilled civil servants&#13;
to implement its CBR reform program.&#13;
The Ministry of Mines and Ministry of Social Affairs also have been approved, and several others are at various stages of proposal development.&#13;
Recruitment of senior-level civil servants funded through CBR is progressing; a total of 99 active senior management group positions are currently funded with over&#13;
100 more in various stages of recruitment.&#13;
CBR is also encouraging salary harmonization for donor-funded consultants led by the Bank.&#13;

Project Background:&#13;
Financial stability is central to sustainable development and financing growth in Afghanistan. Central Bank of Afghanistan (DAB) is required to play a pivotal regulatory&#13;
role to maintain financial stability and health of the financial system. Moreover, investing in financial infrastructure is a key to enhancing financial intermediation and&#13;
boost the systemâ&#128;&#153;s efficiency. This project is run by DAB and aims at supporting the following activities: (i) undertaking financial audits in accordance with international&#13;
standards, portfolio audits and institutional audits of 10 key commercial banks operating in Afghanistan (implemented); (ii) modernization of the Afghanistan national&#13;
payment system to facilitate payments within the country; (iii) support for the development of the Afghanistan Institute of Banking and Finance; and (iv) technical&#13;
assistance and training for project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:&#13;
The project assists DAB in developing action plans for improved banking supervision and to establish key building blocks of financial sector infrastructure: payment&#13;
system, movable collateral and public credit registry.&#13;
&#13;
Components and subcomponents are:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Strengthening of DABâ&#128;&#153;s capacity: This component includes: (i) financial, portfolio and institutional audit of 10 commercial banks operating in Afghanistan, (ii)&#13;
       stock taking on capacity-building efforts on financial supervision over the last 10 years, and development and implementation of a capacity-building plan to&#13;
       sustainably strengthen the Financial Supervision Department; (iii) review of banking regulation framework; and (iv) development and implementation of action&#13;
       plans following audits of commercial banks.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Development of the financial sector infrastructure: This component involves modernization of the national payment system, and support to the Afghanistan&#13;
       Institute of Banking and Finance.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Technical assistance and training for project implementation.&#13;
Results Achieved:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Under this project a fully fledged audit of the key 10 commercial banks operating in Afghanistan was completed and provided DAB with detailed and thorough&#13;
       guidance on the state of financial stability within the banking system.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Developing the Movable Collateral Registry, which was established in February 2013 and followed by the establishment of the Public Credit Registry in December&#13;
       2013. Both are key building blocks to the Afghan financial systemâ&#128;&#153;s infrastructure. Having both systems fully functional streamlined the applications of small and&#13;
       medium-sized enterprises for banking loans and supported lending decisions.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Establishment of the switch is underway at Afghanistan Payment System (APS). The procurement process for development of the Automated Transfer System (ATS)&#13;
       is complete and the contract is expected to be awarded soon. Having these two systems in place will boost financial intermediation and ease flow of liquidity&#13;
       within the banking system, hence, contributing to a more efficient and well-functioning banking system.&#13;

     Project Background:&#13;
     Since 2002, Afghanistan has made considerable progress in telecommunications connectivity, and mobile telephony has become widespread. A high-capacity fiber&#13;
     optic backbone network connects many provinces and provides international connectivity to neighboring countries. The information and communications technology&#13;
     (ICT) sector offers opportunities to expand the reach and delivery of government services and stimulate private sector-led economic growth and employment generation.&#13;
&#13;
     This project builds on the strong growth seen thus far in mobile services to expand service delivery while accelerating expansion and improvements in backbone&#13;
     network connectivity. It also seeks to expand broadband connectivity and accelerate the development of the local private-sector information-technology (IT) industry.&#13;
&#13;
     Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:&#13;
     The goal is to expand connectivity, encourage widespread use of mobile applications in strategic sectors in the government, and support the development of the local&#13;
     IT industry.&#13;
&#13;
     Components are:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Expanding connectivity: Finances the expansion of the national backbone network by 1,000 kilometers (km) and supports the creation of an enabling policy and&#13;
            regulatory environment to increase the reach of high-quality mobile telephone and Internet services to more users.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Mainstreaming mobile applications: Supports activities that build on the high penetration of mobile telephones in Afghanistan to expand the reach and improve&#13;
            the quality of public services and applications that support program management.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      IT industry development: Supports the definition of an IT sector development policy; an IT skills development program to expand the pool of skilled IT profession-&#13;
            als as a key building block for sector development in Afghanistan; and the setting up of an incubator for ICT firms in the ICT Village.&#13;
     Results Achieved:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      About 440 kms of optical fiber cable construction has been completed and four communication nodes on the Northeast segment have become operational.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Common Services Delivery Platform (Mobile Governance Hardware and Software) has been commissioned and 30 mobile applications have been developed and&#13;
            hosted on the platform; Line ministries are in the process of developing the contents.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      1,500 Afghans have been trained under the IT skills development program and another round of specially designed Job-oriented training programs will be run&#13;
            in 2016. Job fairs for 1,500 successful trainees have been held to date.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Two rounds of the Innovation Support Program awarded 15 local innovators for their ideas and solutions on how mobile technologies could help address chal-&#13;
            lenges in various sectors including agriculture, education and health.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Incubator Complex has been constructed in ICT Institute area of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT) and eight start-up business&#13;
            entities have gone through the program to date.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      MCIT is preparing an open-access policy for the national backbone network, ensuring non-discriminatory access to wholesale Internet bandwidth for all firms.&#13;
            Backbone tariff controls, quality of service, and interconnect costs have been analyzed. A framework has been established for a new ICT policy, a IT industry policy&#13;
            and a m-governance strategy.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Under the capacity-building program of MCIT, 443 staff members of the ministry have been trained so far.&#13;

&#13;
Project Background:&#13;
The National Solidarity Program (NSP) is a flagship program of the government of Afghanistan and is currently operating in all 34 provinces. The Afghan government&#13;
launched NSP to lay the foundation for a sustainable form of inclusive local governance, rural reconstruction, and poverty alleviation. It is identified in Afghanistanâ&#128;&#153;s National&#13;
Development Strategy as the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s principal community development program. The NSP, currently in its 12th year and third phase, is executed by the Afghanistan&#13;
Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development (MRRD).&#13;
&#13;
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:&#13;
The objective is to build, strengthen, and maintain community development councils (CDCs) as effective institutions for local governance and socioeconomic development.&#13;
Components are:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Capacity building: Establish CDCs to: (i) function as village-level governance bodies for continued empowerment of village communities; and (ii) facilitate communitiesâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
       participation in the various sector programs operating in rural areas.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Community grants for economic and social development: Provide block grants to communities to fund priority investment schemes (subprojects) for rural and social&#13;
       development&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Project implementation: Support MRRDâ&#128;&#153;s overall management and oversight of NSP.&#13;
Results Achieved:&#13;
Since 2003, NSP has successfully established CDCs in over 34,600 communities, and supported subsequent rounds of CDC elections in over 11,400 of these communities.&#13;
Over 485,000 CDC members have been elected, registered and trained in a variety of areas including their roles and responsibilities, basic accounting, basic procurement,&#13;
basic project management, and linkages with other government and development actors. Over 950,000 community members have also been trained to support the CDCs&#13;
with project management and/or operations and maintenance. In a sign of ownership, communities have contributed over $150 million in cash, -in-kind contributions, and&#13;
voluntary labor towards the subprojects implemented via the NSP.&#13;
Section A (NSP III):&#13;
Specifically under the current phase, over 14,530 new CDCs have been established and over 11,300 been re-elected. Together, over 25,700 CDPs have been prepared, and&#13;
over 41,200 subproject proposals designed. More than 40,800 of these proposals have been financed with block grants totaling $922 million, and of them over 24,600 have&#13;
been closed while others are ongoing. The sub-projects financed include transportation (30 percent), water supply and sanitation (25 percent), irrigation (26 percent) power&#13;
(5 percent) and others (14 percent). Over 15 million people have benefited from financed sub-projects. NSP has created temporary rural employment by generating over 27&#13;
million labor days.&#13;
Section B (Overall NSP I,II and III):&#13;
Cumulatively, during all the NSP phases to date, over 34,600 CDCs have been elected and over 11,300 of these have held re-elections. More than $2.19 billion has been&#13;
received, of which about $1.57 billion has gone to communities through block grants to finance over 87,900 sub-projects. More than 71,800 of these projects have been&#13;
closed and the remaining are ongoing.&#13;
Over 6.1 million families have benefited from NSP sub-projects financed. NSP has created temporary rural employment by generating over 52 million labor days during the&#13;
he past 12 years.&#13;

&#13;
Project Background:&#13;
Most irrigation schemes in Afghanistan are operating at 25 percent efficiency, as compared to the norm of 40-60 percent elsewhere in South Asia. Water loss occurs&#13;
at farm level because the absence of proper farm-level irrigation systems (basins, furrows) leads to wastage of water supplied from the watercourses. Under the&#13;
Agriculture Production and Productivity Program, the first step is to improve agricultural productivity by reducing water loss in tertiary canals and proper on-farm water&#13;
management practices. Additional financing of about $45 million from the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund is being prepared. It is expected to be approved by&#13;
end of 2015.&#13;
&#13;
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:&#13;
The objective is to improve agricultural productivity in project areas by enhancing the efficiency of water used.&#13;
Components are:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      On-farm water management: Carries out social mobilization for the establishment of irrigation associations (IAs) in the project areas, including the provision of: (i)&#13;
       training to communities in organization and management of IAs; (ii) facilitation services for communities to develop the IAsâ&#128;&#153; internal legal rules and regulations;&#13;
       (iii) assistance to IAs to be registered under the Water Law; (iv) technical training to IAs; and (v) carrying out engineering surveys and infrastructure improvements&#13;
       to small irrigation schemes, or tertiary canals, covering approximately 10,000 hectares in the project areas.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Institutional strengthening and capacity building: Develops institutional capacity at the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock (MAIL) to plan, design,&#13;
       implement, and monitor on-farm water management programs. Supports the construction of five office buildings to accommodate the ministryâ&#128;&#153;s irrigation direc-&#13;
       torate and staff at regional centers in Kabul, Herat, Mazar-e-Sharif, Baghlan and Jalalabad.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Project management, coordination, monitoring and evaluation: Strengthens institutional capacity at the ministry for project implementation, monitoring, and&#13;
       evaluation by establishing and maintaining a project implementation unit comprising a Kabul-based core team, five project area teams, and internationally&#13;
       recruited experts.&#13;
Results Achieved:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Land productivity of wheat and other crops has increased by 15 percent, while water productivity of wheat and other crops also increased by 10 percent and ir-&#13;
       rigated area by 10 percent.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Physical rehabilitation of irrigation schemes exceeded its target with good quality and within the project budget allocation and timeline. To date, 100 irrigation&#13;
       schemes (mostly informal) have been rehabilitated covering a total of 19,000 hectares of irrigation command area.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Establishment of 175 irrigation associations (IAs) has been completed. The IAs are based on traditional Mirab system and have taken up the responsibilities for&#13;
       operation and maintenance.&#13;

     Project Background:&#13;
     Building core public financial management (PFM) capacity in government has been one of the fundamental thrusts of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s in-terim support strategy for&#13;
     Afghanistan. The Bank has gained valuable insight on PFM issues in Afghanistan through International Development Association (IDA)-funded technical assistance&#13;
     projects and extensive analytical work.&#13;
&#13;
     In the wake of discussions between the government and the donor community on a planned transition for Afghanistan to take greater responsibility in managing the&#13;
     reconstruction agenda, the government prepared and shared with donors at the Kabul Donor Conference in June 2010 a PFM â&#128;&#156;roadmapâ&#128;&#157;. It is guided by the vision that:&#13;
     (i) policies that reflect the aspirations and needs of the Afghan people drive the government budget; (ii) a government budget assigns responsibility for development&#13;
     outcomes; (iii) efficient public finance and equitable allocation of resources sustain economic development; and (iv) accountable civil servants and equitable delivery&#13;
     of services build citizensâ&#128;&#153; trust in government.&#13;
&#13;
     Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:&#13;
     To strengthen public financial management through effective procurement, treasury and audit structures and systems in line with sound financial management&#13;
     standards of monitoring, reporting, and control.&#13;

     â&#150; â&#150;      Procurement reform: Introduces procurement reform aimed at enhancing procurement facilitation, capacity building in line ministries and provinces, and insti-&#13;
            tutional development.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Financial management reform: Supports financial management reform in treasury operations and system development, human resources capacity development,&#13;
            professional accountant organization, and line ministry public financial management assessments.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Audit reform: Supports reforms and performance improvement through training for internal and external audit.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Reform management: Supports monitoring technical assistance and reporting on benchmarks of the PFM roadmap&#13;
     Results Achieved:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      The legal framework underpinning public financial management in Afghanistan has been established. The government now prepares and passes a comprehen-&#13;
            sive budget in an orderly and transparent manner.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      A governmentâ&#128;&#147;wide integrated financial management information system is in place.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Project support to Afghanistanâ&#128;&#153;s centralized procurement oversight has been mobilized and the National Procurement Authority, as successor to the Procurement&#13;
            Policy Unit, continues to assist with the reorganization, development, and assessment of procurement units in the line ministries.&#13;

Project Background:&#13;
The Afghan formal social protection system consists largely of a pension scheme for public sector employees, military, police and a Martyrs and Disabled Pension&#13;
Program. In addition, a social safety net encompasses a number of government and donor schemes that transfer cash and in-kind benefits to various groups.&#13;
In pensions, the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s objective is to ensure fiscal sustainability and mitigate fiscal impact of the civil service reform on the pension program, making it&#13;
consistent with the broader public-sector reform agenda. However, the recent increase in spending in the Martyrs and Disabled Program puts at risk the sustainability&#13;
of social protection expenditures. In safety nets, the government aims to build a targeted and scalable system in the country.&#13;
&#13;
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:&#13;
The projectâ&#128;&#153;s goals are to improve the administration of the public pension schemes, and develop administrative systems for safety net interventions, with a focus on&#13;
targeting and benefit payment delivery systems, while delivering cash benefits to the poorest families in specific pilot districts.&#13;
&#13;
Project Components are:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Pensions: Supports the design of new administrative arrangements for the public pension system and modernization of the existing pension systems, including&#13;
       the Martyrs and Disabled Pension.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Safety Nets: Supports designing and piloting of targeting and delivery systems to establish a poverty-targeted cash transfer system. This includes capacity devel-&#13;
       opment at the ministry to deliver and coordinate social protection programs.&#13;
Results Achieved:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Key elements of a reformed and modernized Public Sector Pension System are in place. Those elements include: a revised institutional and human resources&#13;
       structure of the Pension Department; a comprehensive new Management Information System (MIS); a set of business processes; fiscal forecasting models for&#13;
       revenues and expenditures; and a new chart of accounts of the pension system. Around 55,000 pensioners are registered in the new pension MIS and are paid&#13;
       through bank accounts.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;       A multi-phased safety net cash transfer pilot has been designed, implemented, and evaluated. A targeting and benefit delivery mechanism has been tested and&#13;
       is now being further improved, together with computerized registration.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      The pilot program over the past three years has provided support in cash transfers to more than 16,000 poor and vulnerable families (around 80,000 individuals)&#13;
       in eight selected districts in five provinces.&#13;

     Background and Objectives:&#13;
     The development objective of the project is to increase the number of electricity connections for the urban centers of Charikar, Gulbahar and Jabul-es-Seraj and Pul-e-&#13;
     Khumri and to improve the availability of power from Naghlu and Mahipar switchyards.&#13;
     The original project had three components: (i) rehabilitation of the distribution system in Charikar, Gulbahar, and Jabul-es-Seraj (in Parwan province) and Pul-e-&#13;
     Khumri (in Baghlan province); (ii) rehabilitation of transmission switchyards at the Mahipar and Naghlu hydro-power stations on the Kabul River; and (iii) project&#13;
     implementation support to the Ministry of Energy and Water and the recruitment/retention of a project management firm. Under the additional financing, the&#13;
     implementation of components under the original project will be completed by covering the cost overrun and restructuring project implementation by components.&#13;
&#13;
     Key Achievements:&#13;
     The Mahipar switchyard rehabilitation under contract has been completed and handed over to DABS, and staff at the hydropower station are trained on the operation of&#13;
     the new equipment. All materials for rehabilitation have been delivered to the Naghlu site, and the work has been started.Additional financing is expected to increase&#13;
     the number of electricity connections for the remaining urban centers of Pul-e-Khumri in an â&#128;&#156;institutionally efficient wayâ&#128;&#157;, and to improve the availability of power from&#13;
     the Naghlu and Mahipar switchyards by completing the remaining rehabilitation works at Ngahlu hydropower plant switchyard.&#13;

Background and Objectives:&#13;
As part of the Central Asia-South Asia Electricity Transmission and Trade Project (CASA-1000), the four participating countries --Afghanistan, Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan&#13;
and Tajikistan, -- will implement individual community support programs (CSPs) in each country, with the aim of increasing the shared prosperity associated with the&#13;
project for communities along the CASA-1000 corridor.&#13;
The Afghanistan CASA-CSP Project development object is to provide access to electricity or other social and economic infrastructure services to communities in the&#13;
project area in order to strengthen community support for CASA-1000 transmission line.&#13;
&#13;
Key Achievements:&#13;
Work under CASA-CSP will begin once the CASA-1000 project is operational. Once implementation begins, the CSP is expected to benefit communities that live along&#13;
a two-kilometer â&#128;&#156;Corridor of Influenceâ&#128;&#157; on each side of the CASA-1000 transmission line. It is expected that there will be approximately 700 communities spread over&#13;
23 districts in six provinces, with a total of over 152,000 families along the corridor.&#13;

     Background and Objectives:&#13;
     The Kabul Municipal Development Program (KMDP) grant for $110 million was approved and became effective in April 2014. As of April 9, 2015, within one year&#13;
     of effectiveness, disbursements stand at $15.2 million (14 percent). The project development objectives (PDO) remain highly relevant for Kabul, a city with over 70&#13;
     percent of its population living in unplanned settlements. KMDPâ&#128;&#153;s cost- effective methodology enables equitable service delivery, strengthens the social capital of&#13;
     the beneficiary communities, and continues to entrench a culture of community participation in decision making over public expenditures that directly impact the&#13;
     community. The likelihood of achieving end-of-project, as well as intermediate, PDO indicator targets is high. The PDO is rated â&#128;&#156;satisfactoryâ&#128;&#157;.&#13;
     The project development objectives are to: (i) increase access to basic municipal services in selected residential areas of Kabul city; (ii) redesign the Kabul Muncipalityâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
     financial management system to support better service delivery; and (iii) enable early response in the event of an eligible emergency.&#13;
&#13;
     Key Achievements:&#13;
     Effective for just over a year, implementation of the KMDP grant is progressing well, and it is expected to achieve the indicator targets at the project outcome level and&#13;
     at the intermediate level by the closing date.&#13;
     Grant disbursements stand at $15.21 million (14 percent) and KMDP commitments at $23.5million (21.3 percent). By December 31, 2016, cumulative expenditures&#13;
     by KMDP within 20 months of effectiveness of the grant are expected to be about $35 million (about 32 percent).&#13;
     There are 313,885 direct beneficiaries (40 percent of the target number -- 102,995 from upgrading and 210,890 from trunk roads) and 76,985 indirect beneficiaries.&#13;
     The latter group includes students, teachers and staff of several schools and institutions of higher education that are located within the upgraded areas. About 73&#13;
     percent of the beneficiaries are women and children. About 11,300 tree samplings have been planted in 13 gozars with community contributions; and community&#13;
     solid waste collection mechanisms are functioning in most of the gozars. The works executed have generated 670,456 mandays of temporary employment.&#13;

Background and Objectives:&#13;
Unprecedented population growth in Kabul, large-scale destruction of the cityâ&#128;&#153;s infrastructure during the war, followed by a growing concentration of security-related&#13;
activity has exacerbated the backlog of infrastructure deficiency in a city that harbors the capital functions of the country. A city originally planned for less than one&#13;
million people, is now ranked 86th among the worldâ&#128;&#153;s largest agglomerations. The capacity of the existing road network is diminished further by an astronomical&#13;
growth in the number of motor vehicles that is today double the 300,000 vehicles for which the network was designed. The result is extreme congestion that is further&#13;
exacerbated by security-related encroachments and road closures.&#13;
&#13;
Urban productivity of Kabul is deeply impacted by inadequate transport services. Although Kabulâ&#128;&#153;s existing urban road network, initially planned and developed in&#13;
1960s with technical support from the former Soviet Union, provides generous widths, road surfaces have deteriorated due to age, poor maintenance, severe weather&#13;
conditions, and the lack of proper drainage. Fifty-five percent of the network is in need of rehabilitation. More than 61 percent of the urban population accesses their&#13;
homes through unpaved roads. The result is poor access to jobs and services, low mobility of passenger and freight movement, congestion, increased road accident&#13;
rates, and productivity losses.&#13;
&#13;
The project development objective is to improve road conditions and traffic flows in selected corridors of Kabul City.&#13;
&#13;
Key Achievements:&#13;
Initial activities including survey, design review, and procurement of civil works started during the preparation of the project. As of July 15, 2015, two of four national&#13;
competitive bidding civil works contracts (Lot-1 - 1.92 km and Lot-2 - 2.52 km) have been implemented and the road is opened to the traffic. Physical progress of Lot-3&#13;
stands at 65 percent and at 10 percent for Lot-4. The pro-curement process for two of four international competitive bidding civil works contracts (Lot-5 and Lot-6) has&#13;
been completed and the contracts are ready for award. The design review for Lot-8 is completed and the procurement process has started, while the design review for&#13;
Lot-7 and Wazir Abad canal is in progress. The terms of reference for the soft studies under Component B have been prepared and sent to the bank for review.&#13;

     Background and Objectives:&#13;
     It is widely acknowledged that Afghanistanâ&#128;&#153;s growth is constrained by the incidence of poverty, high illiteracy, and the lack of a skilled labor force. This proposed project&#13;
     directly links literacy and skills development by designing interventions that improve access to skills for illiterate and unskilled young Afghan men and women. The&#13;
     project will incentivize non-formal training providers to provide quality training to Afghan men and women and increase their job-placement rates. Subsequently, the&#13;
     project shall promote entrepreneurship among youth to help improve their welfare status.&#13;
&#13;
     To increase the potential for employment and higher earnings of targeted young Afghan women and men in rural and semi-urban areas through non-formal skills&#13;
     training. The project has the following components:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Improving the quality of non-formal training and the labor market outcomes of trainees.	&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Project management, capacity building of the Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs, Martyrs and Disabled (MOLSAMD) and monitoring and evaluation. Strengthening&#13;
            the capacity of National Skills Development Program/MOLSAMD for project implementation and monitoring.	&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Piloting entrepreneurship among unskilled and Illiterate young Afghans. Many young Afghans are unskilled and illiterate and are unprepared to compete in the&#13;
            labor market.	&#13;
     Key Achievements:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Mapping of the training providers across the country.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Complete the environmental and social assessment study.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Consultative discussion with stakeholders for identification and development of 10 priority occupations for certification and curriculum development.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Completion of the web-based applications for capturing project data in final stages.&#13;

Project Background:&#13;
The Afghanistan Secured Lending Project is part of the Financial Infrastructure Program in the Middle East North Africa (MENA) region. The Inertional Finance&#13;
Corporationâ&#128;&#153;s access to finance advisory services in the MENA region, through its Secured Transactions and Collateral Registries Team, assists government clients in&#13;
developing the appropriate legal and institutional frameworks to allow and encourage the use of movable assets as collateral for loans.&#13;
At inception of the project, the results from the Doing Business ranking on the Ease of Getting Credit, a measure of credit information sharing and legal rights of&#13;
borrowers and lenders, showed that the financial sector in Afghanistan was not able to meet the needs of small firms or individuals â&#128;&#147; Afghanistan ranked 179th out of&#13;
181 countries in 2009. 	&#13;
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:&#13;
The overall objective of the project is to achieve sustained development of the financial sector by increasing private-sector access to finance, particularly credit, in the&#13;
MENA region, by strengthening lender rights in movable assets.&#13;
&#13;
In Afghanistan, the project operates under three components: (i) legislative reform resulting in enactment or amendment of laws and regulations to enhance rights&#13;
of creditors of movable assets; (ii) creation of a functioning movable asset registry to enable lenders to effectively file a notice related to their proprietary rights, and&#13;
(iii) awareness-raising and capacity-building activities to increase knowledge among stakeholders about the benefits of well-functioning secured financing systems.&#13;
The overall program targets are to benefit 250 micro, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with expanded access to finance, facilitate $13 million in financing to SMEs&#13;
(secured with movable property as collateral) and an overall $30 million in financing facilitated&#13;
&#13;
Results Achieved:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Legislation on secured transactions in movable property and a regulation for operating the registry adopted in Afghanistan Collateral Registry. There were 3,869&#13;
       new registrations as of May 2015.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Improvement in 2015 from zero to nine in Afghanistanâ&#128;&#153;s rating on the â&#128;&#156;Strength of Legal Rights Index,â&#128;&#157; a subset of Doing Businessâ&#128;&#153; â&#128;&#156;Ease of Getting Creditâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
       measure. Further in 2015, Afghanistan was ranked 89th out of 189 countries on the â&#128;&#156;Ease of Getting Creditâ&#128;&#157; ranking.&#13;

     Project Background:&#13;
     Afghanistan International Bank (AIB) has as shareholders the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and two Afghan private-sector business groups, Horizon Associates LLC&#13;
     (HA) and Wilton Holdings Ltd. (WHL). The three have ownership stakes of of 7.5 percent, 46.25 percent and 46.25 percent, respectively. The bank was founded in March&#13;
     2004 and is present in the major cities of Afghanistan through its network of 32 branches. It has roughly a 22 percent share in the total assets of the banking sector,&#13;
     and was the first bank to commence ATM services and introduce international debit card services in Afghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
     AIB focuses its lending efforts on corporates and the small and medium-sized enterprises (SME), mostly in construction (31 percent) and fuel supply (31 percent)&#13;
     segments. In 2012, AIB acquired Standard Chartered Bankâ&#128;&#153;s retail business in Afghanistan comprising one branch, nine ATMs and gross assets of $229 million. As of&#13;
     June 2015, AIB has 33 branches, two cash outlets and employs about 680 staff members.&#13;
     Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:&#13;
     To contribute to the reconstruction and economic development of Afghanistan by providing financing to small and medium sized businesses, which are at the forefront&#13;
     of job creation in the fledgling economy.&#13;
     To develop the financial sector by providing basic financial services currently not available in the market. The project was expected to contribute to overall financial-&#13;
     sector reform by setting best-practice standards and supporting the authorities in developing the evolving legal and regulatory framework.&#13;
&#13;
     Results Achieved:&#13;
     AIB has made a substantial development impact evident from its market-leader position in the banking sector of Afghanistan; it ranks first in terms of assets.&#13;
&#13;
     AIB is also regarded highly in the sector through its financial performance characterized by a relatively sound asset quality despite the tough operating and&#13;
     macroeconomic environment.&#13;

&#13;
Project Background:&#13;
The private sector in Afghanistan still lacks a sufficient level of capacity and understanding of good business skills and practices.&#13;
This lack of knowledge affects the ability of the private sector to grow or to export, which in turn affects economic growth. The business development services (BDS)/&#13;
management skills training market, while having improved its capacity to deliver high-quality training using material customized to the local business environment,&#13;
is still underdeveloped and requires further assistance to enable it to orient itself towards the private sector and its training needs.&#13;
&#13;
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has been contributing to the development of management capacity in both the public and private sector with its Business&#13;
Edge (BE) management-training program for the past four years (September 2008 to March 2013).&#13;
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      The overall goal of the project is to enhance the business performance and increase the revenue of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) by developing&#13;
       their managerial capacities using IFCâ&#128;&#153;s BE product.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      The project will build the capacity of local training providers to deliver BE management training to 5,200 individuals (of whom 1,820 are women), reaching 520&#13;
       MSMEs.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Approximately 77 percent of the targets (4,000 individuals trained) will be reached by project completion (June 30, 2016) and 23 percent of targets (1,200) will&#13;
       be reached within three years of post-project completion (by June 30, 2019).&#13;
Results Achieved:&#13;
From inception in September 2008 to June 30, 2015, the project has delivered training to 9,056 people including 3,935 (43 percent) women and reached 801 MSMEs.&#13;
The impact assessment indicated that 91 percent of the private-sector respondents expressed a positive impact of the BE training on company performance.&#13;
&#13;
From April 2013, to June 2015, the current project has delivered training to 5,604 people including 2,724 (48.6 percent) women and reached 547 MSMEs. In 2014,&#13;
two impact assessment surveys were conducted to determine both the impact of BE training on unemployed individuals and the impact of Business Thematic Radio&#13;
programs sponsored by IFC on businesses. Results show:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      68 percent of the trained individuals stated that the training helped them in getting jobs.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      8 percent individuals reported that the training helped them in setting up their own businesses.&#13;
Of the 608 respondents, 76 percent of individuals employed the skills and ideas acquired from the radio programs and most of them reported positive impact of the&#13;
programs on their businesses.&#13;

     Project Background:&#13;
     The Afghanistan Construction Permits Reform Project, launched in May 2014, aims to support the Afghan government as it revamps the way construction permits&#13;
     are issued across the country. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) will help officials simplify the often time-consuming permitting process and advise the&#13;
     government as it develops new permitting laws. The changes, planned for the provinces at the national and subnational levels, are designed to spur the growth of&#13;
     Afghanistanâ&#128;&#153;s construction sector, a vital part of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s economy. That, in turn, is expected to increase the supply of affordable housing at a time when the demand&#13;
     for new homes is growing quickly. The project is part of a wider IFC effort to help diversify Afghanistanâ&#128;&#153;s economy and spur growth across the nation.&#13;
     Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:&#13;
     The objective of this project is to develop a simplified yet effective construction-permit system and regulatory framework that will improve the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s efficiency&#13;
     and capacity to issue construction permits. By doing so, the private sector will benefit from reduced costs through the easing of permitting bottlenecks, which hamper&#13;
     the ability of the growing housing sector in Afghanistan to meet demand.&#13;
     The new framework will also allow the government to retroactively formalize unpermitted buildings. The project aims to reduce the time it takes to obtain construction&#13;
     permits from the current 334 days to 180 days, reduce the number of procedures from 15 to nine, and improve the capacity of civil servants operating the process.&#13;
     Changes are expected to increase both the efficiency and capacity of the Kabul Municipality to issue construction permits and, hence, increase applications under the&#13;
     reformed permits system by 40 percent.&#13;
&#13;
     Results Achieved:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Implement and monitor the new, simplified construction permit processes in Kabul to ensure smooth operations and make necessary adjustments based on early&#13;
            implementation results.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Provide the necessary legal expertise to support the client in drafting framework changes in light of best practices.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Support the Afghan government in the implementation of the capacity building/training plan. The training plan will comprise two levels to address operational-&#13;
            level staff and management (decision-making) level officials.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Run the private public-dialogue as per the design stage.&#13;

Project Background:&#13;
Founded in 2003, Roshan is the leading local mobile operator in Afghanistan, with an estimated 27 percent mobile market share and 5.6 million subscribers as of&#13;
March 2013. The company currently reaches 230 cities and towns in all of Afghanistanâ&#128;&#153;s 34 provinces and covers approximately 62 percent of the population.&#13;
In mid-2012, Roshan approached the International Finance Corporation (IFC) about financing: (i) the acquisition of its 3G license; (ii) the capital expenditures to roll-out&#13;
the 3G network and improve the 2G network; and (iii) consolidation of its existing loans into a single loan and extending its maturity&#13;
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:&#13;
IFC provided Roshan with long-term financing not available from local commercial banks or capital markets to finance its 3G expansion plan.&#13;
Given an Internet penetration rate of only 4 percent and a fixed-line penetration of 1 percent in the country, IFCâ&#128;&#153;s investment is expected to create a competitive&#13;
environment that motivates all operators to provide the best quality mobile data services at competitive prices to the Afghan population.&#13;
In accordance with the 3G license obligations, Roshan will extend its mobile broadband services coverage to achieve a target of 80 percent population coverage in key&#13;
cities within five years.&#13;
Other development impacts include: (i) broadening economic opportunity to reach the unbanked population in Afghanistan through Roshanâ&#128;&#153;s mobile banking&#13;
services; (ii) financially supporting community social programs such as building schools and playgrounds and providing clean water wells; and (iii) reducing the&#13;
gender gap by financially supporting the inclusion of women in society.&#13;
&#13;
Results Expected:&#13;
With IFCâ&#128;&#153;s investment, Roshan is expected to achieve the following results by 2015:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Increase mobile banking customers to 900,000 (against less than 100,000 at time of investment).&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Increase mobile customers to 8.1 million (against 5.6 million at time of investment).&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Increase direct employment to 1,417 (against approximately 1,200 at time of investment).&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Support local companies and small and medium-sized enterprises by partnering with over 4,600 dealers and distributors (against 4,300 at time of investment).&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Increase the amount of regulatory fees and taxes paid to the government to $59 million ($41 million in 2012).&#13;

     Project Background:&#13;
     This project builds on the success of a previous successful International Finance Corporation (IFC) intervention in the horticulture sector, Afghanistan Horticulture&#13;
     Exports Development, which helped farmers to adopt best agriculture practices for two major export commodities (raisins and pomegranates).&#13;
&#13;
     The project will focus on improving farmersâ&#128;&#153; skills and expanding market opportunities for Afghan agriculture commodities through improving access to export&#13;
     markets, and strengthening the overall value chain, including processing opportunities for grade B fruits.&#13;
&#13;
     The project will reach out to farmers located in remote locations, leveraging the skills of the extension workers association established and trained in the previous&#13;
     project. These farmers will be integrated into the supply chain of large fruit exporting and processing firms in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, these lead agribusinesses will&#13;
     be supported in becoming compliant with global standards required for access to high-end markets for food products.&#13;
     Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:&#13;
     The overall objective of the project is to increase the supply of fresh and processed fruits, through improved compliance with market standards, and integration of&#13;
     farmers into the value chain of lead agribusiness firms, giving them access to wider market opportunities.&#13;
     The project will initially start its activities in Kandahar province, building on the success of the previous project, while assessing the potential of expanding to other&#13;
     provinces in Afghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
     Results Expected:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Support 1,000 farmers in adopting best agriculture practices for fruits and complying with market standards. The outreach to farmers will be ensured through the&#13;
            already-established network of extension workers in Kandahar.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Improve the operations of at least one lead Afghan agribusiness firm through the integration of farmers who were able to implement best practices in their supply&#13;
            chains.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Increase the sales value of Afghan fresh and processed fruits by $2 million, through at least four export contracts, as a result of supporting one or two leading&#13;
            Afghan agribusiness firms in accessing wider market opportunities.&#13;

Project Background:&#13;
Dairy products are a major source of protein in Afghanistan. However, the dairy sector was largely destroyed during the Afghan civil war and has yet to fully recover.&#13;
Imported dairy products have gained the majority of the market share in large metropolitan areas, including Kabul.&#13;
Supporting the livestock and local dairy industries has been a priority for the Afghan government as well as international development organizations. However,&#13;
domestic producers continue to find it difficult to compete with imported products in terms of both quality and quantity.&#13;
The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) issued a guarantee of $1.82 million for 10 years to Mido Dairy Production Co. (MIDO) to cover direct equity&#13;
against the following risks: transfer restriction, expropriation, and war and civil disturbance.&#13;
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:&#13;
From both the country and sector perspectives, MIGA is playing an important role in facilitating private investment to promote the technical know-how and investment&#13;
needed to develop this sector in a conflict-affected country.&#13;
&#13;
Project entails the establishment of a joint venture company in Afghanistan, MIDO. It has a dairy processing plant located in the suburbs of Kabul that will produce and&#13;
distribute high-quality dairy products such as milk and yogurt, primarily to Kabul.&#13;
&#13;
Results Expected:&#13;
With MIGA guarantee coverage, MIDO is expected to achieve:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      The generation of 20-25 new permanent jobs.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      â&#130;¬1.2 million over the seven years of operation in taxes and fees.&#13;

     Project Background:&#13;
     Afghanistan is the third largest producer of raw (greasy) cashmere in the world, after China and Mongolia. Cashmere is harvested only in limited areas of Afghanistan,&#13;
     mostly in the western provinces of Herat, Farah, Ghor, and Badghis.&#13;
     Currently, Afghanistan exports around 1,000 metric tons of cashmere on an annual basis. The main trade center is Herat, where a handful of exporters gather to&#13;
     purchase the cashmere from farmers.&#13;
     The project was initially supported by the Afghanistan Small and Medium Enterprise Development program and funded by the US Agency for International Development&#13;
     (USAID). In 2011, this program provided funding to Traitex Belgium and Cashmere Fibres International, the largest dehairer of Afghan cashmere, to set up operations&#13;
     in Afghanistan to increase the value-added within the country and to promote the development of the sector.&#13;
&#13;
     Traitex Belgium is an independent processing company that scours and carbonizes wool and cashmere. It is based in Verviers, Belgium. In June 2013, the Multilateral&#13;
     Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) issued a guarantee of $1.3 million to Traitex to cover direct equity against the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, and war&#13;
     and civil disturbance.&#13;

Project Background:&#13;
In 2002, following decades of armed conflict, Afghanistan had a barely functioning and severely limited communications network. In early 2007, the International&#13;
Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) made a commitment to provide support directly to the most recent (third) mobile&#13;
operator, MTN Group (then Areeba Afghanistan). IFC initially made an investment commitment in Areeba Afghanistan in 2006, which was later replaced by a larger&#13;
investment facility to MTN Afghanistan comprising an equity investment of $13.5 million and senior debt of $65 million to finance the expansion of MTNâ&#128;&#153;s operations.&#13;
MIGA issued a guarantee of $74.5 million to cover its direct equity investment of $85 million in Afghanistan. The coverage was for 15 years against two risks: (i) transfer&#13;
and convertibility restriction; and (ii) expropriation. The Afghanistan Investment Guarantee Facility (AIGF), managed by MIGA, provided $2 million of first loss. In 2011,&#13;
when MTN Group expanded its network, MIGA issued a second guarantee of $84.1 million. These guarantees bring MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s total gross coverage to $158.6 million and&#13;
total net coverage up to $108.6 million. IFC exited its equity investment in July 2013 and the debt will be fully repaid in September 2015.&#13;
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:&#13;
From both a country and sector perspective, MIGA and IFC are playing an important role in facilitating south-south investment to promote the expansion of&#13;
telecommunications infrastructure in a conflict-affected country, increasing the availability and affordability of communication services in Afghanistan. Furthermore,&#13;
IFCâ&#128;&#153;s investment has been supporting the expansion of telecom services into semi-urban and rural areas of Afghanistan. MIGA can mobilize additional capacity in the&#13;
private insurance market through its reinsurance arrangements. MIGAâ&#128;&#153;s establishment of the AIGF, a first loss fund, with the help of other donor countries, has helped&#13;
bring down the risk of the transaction, making it more attractive for the private reinsurance market.&#13;
&#13;
Results Expected:&#13;
With MIGA guarantee coverage and IFCâ&#128;&#153;s investment and advisory support, MTN has been able to exceed expectations and reach over five million subscribers, close to&#13;
a one-third market share.&#13;

&#13;
     Project Background:&#13;
     The formal sector in Afghanistan is still in a formative stage, since the reopening of the economy to international business in 2002-2003. The economy is dominated&#13;
     by informal enterprises. Registered firms are young and small: half of them have been operating for four years or less, and 91 percent of them have a maximum of&#13;
     five employees. Economic growth is estimated to have fallen to 2 percent in 2014, from 3.7 percent in 2013 and an average of 9 percent during 2003-12; the growth&#13;
     outlook for 2015 remains weak. Some of the major challenges that Afghanistan faces in the immediate and medium term are: restoring confidence and creating&#13;
     private-sector jobs; and strengthening cohesion and service delivery.&#13;
     This project can provide useful data to contribute to these goals as it will cover the measurement of four Doing Business indicators that are actionable at the local&#13;
     level and where subnational differences are likely to occur: starting a business, dealing with construction permits, registering property, and getting electricity. Even&#13;
     in countries characterized by centralized public sector like Afghanistan, these areas show subnational differences at the regulatory level and/or in how the national&#13;
     regulations are implemented in practice. The benchmarking will include four of the largest cities in addition to Kabul that serve as regional economic centers: Herat,&#13;
     Mazar e-Sharif, Kandahar, Jalalabad, Kabul.&#13;
&#13;
     Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:&#13;
     The objective of the project is to support the Government of Afghanistan to advance regulatory reforms at the subnational level to foster a better business-enabling&#13;
     regulatory environment across the country. It will do so by producing a Subnational Doing Business (SNDB) report that benchmarks business regulations and their&#13;
     implementation on four key Doing Business indicators (starting a business, registering property, dealing with construction permits, and getting electricity) across four&#13;
     municipalities (Herat, Mazar e-Sharif, Kandahar, Jalalabad) as well as Kabul.&#13;
&#13;
     The report: (i) allows comparability among municipalities in Afghanistan and with 189 economies worldwide; (ii) identifies regulatory constraints in detail and&#13;
     highlights good practices; (iii) provides in-depth analysis and detailed policy recommendations on how to improve the areas measured; (iv) promotes peer-to-peer&#13;
     learning through the sharing of good practices; (v) and motivates governments to reform by repeating the measurement over time. A second round of Subnational&#13;
     Doing Business bench-marking starting in 2018 will update the measurements and document the reforms undertaken in response to the first benchmarking round in&#13;
     each of the cities. It will also provide further reform recommendations.&#13;
&#13;
     Results Expected:&#13;
     The SNDB in Afghanistan is just starting and has no results to date.&#13;

Project Background:&#13;
The Afghanistan Leasing Project is currently part of the Financial Infrastructure Program in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. At the inception of the&#13;
project, Afghanistan had begun the process of rebuilding its shattered economy following decades of conflict. Responding to a request from the Government of&#13;
Afghanistan in May 2006 Advisory Services-MENAâ&#128;&#153;s Leasing Program conducted a needs assessment to investigate the potential and scope for International Finance&#13;
Corporation (IFC) involvement to develop financial leasing in Afghanistan. The results of the assessment confirmed that the legal infrastructure, technical skills, and&#13;
knowledge of specialized financial products such as leasing are largely absent. Therefore, the need for a comprehensive project that would include legislative reform,&#13;
capacity building, and general awareness-raising activities to stimulate and develop the leasing sector was necessary.&#13;
&#13;
This project will improve the access to finance for micro, small and medium sized enterprises (MSMEs). Micro and small businesses are flourishing and new financial&#13;
institutions have been established to service them. Leasing allows MSMEs to finance capital assets, increase production, improve profitability, and create jobs. As it is&#13;
inherently Shariâ&#128;&#153;a compliant, leasing has particular relevance for Afghanistan. IFC is uniquely qualified to assist the government given its extensive experience, both&#13;
regional and global, in similar projects and expertise in providing advisory services to governments and the private sector to develop leasing markets worldwide.&#13;
&#13;
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:&#13;
The objective of the project is to assist in the development of the leasing sector in Afghanistan through creation of enabling legislation, awareness-raising and capacity-&#13;
building activities to various stakeholders.&#13;
&#13;
The project will benefit MSMEs, financial institutions (banks, leasing companies etc.), and government institutions. Financial institutions will be able to diversify and&#13;
expand their portfolios and enterprises will have greater access to finance. Enterprises will be able to benefit from using assets and generate profits. Government&#13;
institutions and judiciary will obtain the necessary knowledge and skills to support leasing in Afghanistan.&#13;
This objective is expected to be achieved through (i) legal reform resulting in enactment of the Law on Leasing; (ii) tax reform resulting in improvement of the tax&#13;
treatment of leasing operations; and (iii) awareness-raising and capacity-building activities to increase knowledge among stakeholdersâ&#128;&#153; (both government and private&#13;
sector) about the benefits of leasing.&#13;
&#13;
Results Expected:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      The Leasing Law, based on UNIDROIT Model that is considered a global best practice, was enacted in April 2014 and published in the official gazette.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Income tax manual approved.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Final draft on leasing regulation has been submitted for approval by the central bankâ&#128;&#153;s Supreme Council.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      Twelve capacity-building and awareness-raising events for more than 115 participants from the public and private sector were conducted. Satisfaction rate ex-&#13;

     Project Background:&#13;
     The World Bank Group fosters sustainable economic growth in developing countries by providing advisory services to businesses and governments aimed at specific&#13;
     aspects of private-sector development, including supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, enhancing access to finance, improving the business enabling&#13;
     environment, supporting privatization and public-private partnerships and promoting environmental and social sustainable practices. Advisory services are delivered&#13;
     through the Trade and Competitiveness Global Practice in the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s South Asia Region.&#13;
&#13;
     An analysis conducted by International Finance Corporation (IFC) Advisory in December 2013 revealed that starting a business at the subnational level is a very&#13;
     complex, unwieldy and time-consuming process and is a severe impediment to investment at the subnational level. This analysis recommended a fundamental&#13;
     rethinking of the strict system of starting a business enforced by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MoCI) at the subnational level. For example, the report&#13;
     recommended that the MoCI abolish duplicated and unnecessary regulations that were cumbersome to investors. Evidence collected from interviews with business&#13;
     managers at the subnational level, as well as with MoCI officials, indicated that the procedures for obtaining a business license and registration required a minimum&#13;
     of several weeks, and might extend to a few months. This is significantly slower than the two to three days currently required to complete the same process in Kabul.&#13;
&#13;
     Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:&#13;
     The objective of this project is to support the Government of Afghanistan at the national level in Kabul and at the subnational level in 16 other governorates by building&#13;
     on the reforms achieved in the Phase I of the Afghanistan Licensing Reform Project. The overall goal of Phase II is to support the MoCI in promoting an investment&#13;
     climate that is conducive to private-sector growth. To pursue this goal, the project targets to achieve the following objectives by project completion:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Establishing further streamlined processes for increased efficiency and sustainability in the one-stop-shop created at the MoCI during Phase I of the project.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Successfully rolling out the business registration and licensing reforms conducted in Kabul to MoCI offices at the provincial level in light of international best&#13;
            practices. This includes securing the proper needed information and communications technology infrastructure inside these governorates and building the capac-&#13;
            ity of the staff residing at these offices.&#13;
     Results Expected:&#13;
     The expected results for the project will be:&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Implement and monitor the new, simplified business registration and licensing at the national and subnational levels to ensure smooth operations and make&#13;
            necessary adjustments based on early implementation results.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Provide the necessary legal expertise to support the client in drafting framework changes in light of best practices.&#13;
     â&#150; â&#150;      Support the Afghan government in the implementation of the capacity building/training plan. The training plan will comprise two levels to address operational-&#13;
            level staff and management (decision-making) level officials.&#13;

Project Background:&#13;
First Microfinance Bank Afghanistan (FMFB-A) was founded in 2003, and it was the first bank to be licensed in Afghanistan under the new law. It was founded by the Aga&#13;
Khan Fund for Economic Development (AKFED) and subsequently both the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and KfW became shareholders, while the Aga Khan&#13;
Agency for Microfinance (AKAM) replaced AKFED as the principal shareholder and sponsor of the bank. FMFB-A commenced business in May 2004 in Kabul and it is&#13;
regulated by the Central Bank (Da Afghanistan Bank, DAB). FMFB-A offers micro loans, small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) loans and deposit-taking solutions to&#13;
micro entrepreneurs in Afghanistanâ&#128;&#153;s urban and rural areas and stands as the largest regulated microfinance lender in the country.&#13;
&#13;
IFCâ&#128;&#153;s involvement with FMFB-A commenced in 2002 with an original equity investment of $1 million for a stake of 16.7 percent. During 2012, IFC participated in the&#13;
FMFB-Aâ&#128;&#153;s rights issue subscription (amounting to $ 6.8 million) on a prorate basis of $1.1 million. During this rights issue subscription, AKAM has brought in its sister&#13;
agency the Aga Khan Foundation-US (AKF-US) as share-holder in the bank. As a result, the shareholding of FMFB-A is now changed, with AKAM holding a 39.2 percent&#13;
stake, KfW 32.3 percent, IFC 16.7 percent and AKF-US 11.8 percent.&#13;
&#13;
Project Development Objective and Brief Component Description:&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      To create the first commercially sustainable micro-finance institution in Afghanistan to contribute to the development of micro-finance as a viable and attractive&#13;
       commercial activity and provide financial services to the poor and underserved.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      To contribute to the reconstruction and economic development of Afghanistan by providing financing to the most dynamic sector of the fledgling economy - micro&#13;
       and small businesses.&#13;
â&#150; â&#150;      To develop the financial sector by providing basic financial services currently not available in the market. The project is expected to contribute to overall financial-&#13;
       sector reform by giving an example of a best-practice institution and supporting the Interim Authority in developing the evolving legal and regulatory framework&#13;
Results Expected:&#13;
FMFB-A has made a development impact evident from its position as the leading microfinance banks in Afghanistan. It is also regarded highly in the banking sector&#13;
through its continued and improving financial performance characterized by enhanced profitability backed by a growing loan book and sound asset quality despite its&#13;
operating in a tough macroeconomic and security-prone environment. It is a good corporate citizen, having contributed to the national exchequer through its payment of&#13;
taxes, and persistently strives to develop the private sector by introducing new products and market segments (such as housing finance and SME) to help improve access&#13;
to finance in the country. Moreover, it has also developed and implemented an environmental and social system that allows it to screen its portfolio and provide lending&#13;
on a social and environmentally responsible basis.&#13;

            Afghanistan - Country snapshot

        <abstracts>
            The political and security transition
            has affected Afghanistan’s economy much more deeply than
            anticipated. Economic growth slowed significantly in
            2014-2015 as a result of continued political uncertainty and
            an increase in violence. Fiscal vulnerabilities remain high
            and will require a large revenue effort and sustained levels
