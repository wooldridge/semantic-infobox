COTE D'IVOIRE&#13;
AGRICULTURAL EXPORT PROMOTION AND DIVERSIFICATION PROJECT&#13;
Credit and Proiect Summary&#13;
Borrower:            Government of Cote d'lvoire&#13;
Beneficiaries:       Agricultural Producers/Exporters and Professional Organizations&#13;
Credit Amount:       SDR 3.70 million (equivalent to US$5.83 million)&#13;
Terms:               Standard IDA terms, with 40 years maturity&#13;
Project Description:   The project's objectives would be to diversify and expand private agricultural&#13;
exports with a view to supporting the Government's export-led growth strategy,&#13;
through: (a) export market development activities for non traditional agricultural&#13;
products allowing for diversification out of traditional export crops; this would be&#13;
achieved by scaling up actions initiated under an eighteen-month old pilot&#13;
operation as part of project preparation; (b) support to producers' and exporters'&#13;
organizations; and (c) upgrading of export facilities.  The diversification of&#13;
agricultural exports is further intended to reduce the country's excessive&#13;
dependence on traditional crops such as cocoa, coffee and timber. The project&#13;
would have the following components:&#13;
(a)    Export Promotion and Diversification Actions through assisting Ivorian&#13;
producers in: (i) market research, customer identification, meeting quality&#13;
requirements, trial shipments, obtaining pre-export finance and follow-up of sales&#13;
and export shipment; (ii) product development and quality control via adaptive&#13;
research; (iii) establishment of business partnerships for private operators&#13;
engaging in the production and export of products proven to have an important&#13;
export potential for the country, such as desiccated coconut, cashew nut, tropical&#13;
cut flowers and potted plants, essential oils and fruits and vegetables, etc. This&#13;
component is built on the results of the pilot project tested from November 1993&#13;
through April 1995;&#13;
(b)    Support to Producers/Exporters' Organizations by strengthening existing&#13;
privately-controlled professional organizations: producer groups, exporter&#13;
associations, cooperatives, etc., and promoting the creation of new farmer&#13;
associations and the establishment of an Interprofessional Group of Producers' and&#13;
Exporters' Associations. The interprofessional group of associations will not only&#13;
represent the interests of its members but is also expected to become the major&#13;
vehicle for non traditional export market development;&#13;
(c)    Upgrading of Export Handling Facilities through rehabilitating the&#13;
infrastructure in critical areas such as the existing fruit wharf in the Port of&#13;
Abidjan and undertaking minor works for handling and specialized storage&#13;
facilities at the airport for allowing better transit conditions for the export of&#13;
perishable produce.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ii -&#13;
This component will be carried out under parallel financing from grants of the&#13;
European Union; and&#13;
(d)    Support to Project Management which will be carried out by qualified&#13;
private professionals experienced in agricultural export and farmer organization as&#13;
done efficiently during the pilot phase.&#13;
Benefits:             The project will directly benefit an estimated 100 private enterprises/exporters and&#13;
reach indirectly by project completion at least 10,000 growers of non traditional&#13;
crops who, without this project, would have little or no hope to develop successful&#13;
export sales on their own. It will have major impact on agricultural professional&#13;
organizations as it will contribute to streamlining existing associations and helping&#13;
establish new ones. It will empower these organizations to effectively lobby the&#13;
Government for necessary changes related to their activities while enhancing the&#13;
ability of these organizations to represent producers/exporters. The development&#13;
of non traditional crop exports will enhance job creation throughout the country&#13;
for those producers/exporters engaged in such activities. It will further move the&#13;
country from a position of being highly dependent on traditional crops (such as&#13;
cocoa, coffee, cotton, etc.) to a position of producing high value, branded Ivorian&#13;
products which sell at high prices in the off-season markets of Europe and other&#13;
continents. This is expected to bring about a significant improvement in the&#13;
country's export receipts. The project will also result in sigrificant additional&#13;
local value-added because of the expected increase in local demand for processed&#13;
products which would be a side outlet for non exportable products. In addition to&#13;
the above benefits, the project will enhance the skills and knowledge of farmers&#13;
and exporters significantly and carry many farmers from subsistence level farming&#13;
to a position of profitable producers of high value export crops.&#13;
Risks:                The major foreseeable risk is likely to be a slower than expected private sector&#13;
supply response if conflicting interests were to delay the hoped-for improvements&#13;
in the incentive framework for agricultural exports. If the implementation of the&#13;
Government's plan to progressively liberalize sea and air freights were delayed and&#13;
tariffs were not adjusted, there might also be a risk that freight costs could price&#13;
Ivorian products out of the international market. Such risks would be reduced,&#13;
however, through the removal of major economic and sectoral constraints as part&#13;
of the reforms agreed upon under the Economic Recovery Credit (ERC) which&#13;
became effective in November 1994, and those to be supported through the&#13;
proposed Agricultural Structural Adjustment Credit (ASAC), in addition to&#13;
increased involvement in lobbying actions by the recently created Air Freight&#13;
Committee. There is also a risk that government agencies attempt to interfere&#13;
with project activities.  The strengthening of professional organizations and&#13;
eventually their grouping into an interprofessional group of trade associations&#13;
would empower them to better represent and defend their interests, remain self-&#13;
reliant and ensure an effective project implementation.&#13;

COTE D'IVOIRE&#13;
AGRICULTURAL EXPORT PROMOTION AND DIVERSIFICATION PROJECT&#13;
I. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Overview of Role and Evolution of Agriculture&#13;
1.01         The agricultural sector contributes about 33 percent of Cote d'Ivoire total GDP and 66&#13;
percent of its total export revenues (including agroindustrial products). It also provides employment to&#13;
more than two-thirds of the country's labor force. During the first twenty years of independence, Cote&#13;
d'lvoire stood out as an exceptional agricultural performer. Real agricultural GDP grew at 4.5 percent p.a.&#13;
during the 1960s and at 3.3 percent p.a. during the 1970s. This expansion was led by export crops and&#13;
timber which grew at about 7 percent a year, about twice the growth rate of food crops and livestock. The&#13;
performance of the agricultural sector provided the underpinning of the country's remarkable economic and&#13;
social development. During the period 1965-1975, total GDP grew at 7.7 percent p.a. on average, well&#13;
ahead of an annual population growth rate of 4 percent.&#13;
1.02         The good performance of the agricultural sector was the result of a combination of&#13;
favorable factors. The country's rich endowment in relatively fertile land, in particular in the Forest region,&#13;
and abundant rainfalls provided a favorable environment for the low cost production of tree crops such as&#13;
coffee and cocoa. High intemational prices for the country's main export crops allowed the Government to&#13;
set (administratively-fixed) attractive producer prices even after a substantial taxation. The country's&#13;
political stability encouraged the immigration of productive labor from neighboring countries. High levels&#13;
of public investment in basic infrastructure and in direct agricultural production (oil palm and rubber&#13;
plantations) and processing (cotton) provided small farmers with access to markets, technical packages,&#13;
inputs and credit. Substantial investments were also made in research and extension. Because agricultural&#13;
production was essentially based on small farms, the growth of the rural economy was broad-based and&#13;
living standards in rural areas improved substantially, despite economic policies biased in favor of the&#13;
industrial sector and urban populations.&#13;
1.03         Following two decades of growth the performance of agriculture along with the economy&#13;
in general deteriorated sharply in the 1980s. The agricultural GDP average growth rate fell to 1.2 percent&#13;
p.a. during the 1980-91 period, and was a negative 1.2 percent over the 1980-86 period. This decline was&#13;
mainly due to faulty macroeconomic and sectoral policies. At the end of the 1980s, it was compounded by&#13;
a steep drop in the price of CMte d'Ivoire's main export crops on intemational markets. The above factors&#13;
combined to drastically reduce the profitability of agriculture. At the same time, severe budgetary&#13;
constraints forced the Government to drastically scale back public investments and services in favor of the&#13;
rural sector.&#13;
1.04         The crisis of the 1980s uncovered constraints which, although unheeded during the years&#13;
of economic growth, seriously impaired the ability of the sector to adjust to changing intemal and extemal&#13;
circumstances. Inadequate pricing policies introduced a wedge between incentives to farmers and the&#13;
country's comparative advantage for the various crops. The heavy public investment programs of the&#13;
previous decades had created large, ineffective and costly bureaucracies more intent to preserving their&#13;
privileges than to providing services to farmers. The gray area between public and private interests had&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2 -&#13;
permitted the creation of substantial rents which heavily taxed primary producers. Agricultural parastatals,&#13;
good at starting-up the production of a new crop and promoting its adoption by smallholders, were much&#13;
less effective at fostering the diversification of production in their command areas. They were also&#13;
inflexible with regard to production packages proposed to farmers, often disregarding technologies less&#13;
sophisticated but better suited to small-holders circumstances. Because of their monopoly position, they&#13;
were not interested in improving their efficiency since they were able to pass on processing and marketing&#13;
costs to primary producers. These rigidities, combined with the explicit (through export taxes and taxation&#13;
of inputs) and implicit taxation (through the overvaluation of Real Effective Exchange Rate - REER) of&#13;
agriculture, depressed rural incomes and limited the ability of farmers to finance widespread technological&#13;
change. Finally, the Government's policies were inadequate to ensure the sustainable management of the&#13;
country's natural resources, in particular the conservation of its fast disappearing tropical forests.&#13;
1.05         External Trade. The value (in current terms) of agricultural exports, including processed&#13;
products, declined by almost 50 percent from 1985 (CFA franc 1,000 billion) to 1992 (CFA franc 473&#13;
billion). However, the share of agriculture in total export fell only slightly during the period, from 66&#13;
percent to 60 percent of total exports, underlining both the overwhelming importance of agriculture in total&#13;
exports and the negative impact of the fall in commodity prices on world markets. In 1992, cocoa exports&#13;
(beans and processed products) represented 54 percent of the value of total exports (against 45 percent in&#13;
1985), in spite of the fall in their unit price. C6te d'lvoire's main agricultural imports are cereals (rice,&#13;
wheat floor) and animal products (meat, milk and fish). Because of the impact of the economic recession&#13;
on domestic demand, the total value of food imports has steadily declined since 1985. In 1992, it amounted&#13;
to CFA franc 112 billion (4 percent of GDP).&#13;
B. Recent Sectoral Performance&#13;
1.06         Evolution of Competitiveness. The evolution of the Ivorian economy in the latter half of&#13;
the 1980s is characterized by two inter-related developments whose effects have been to seriously erode&#13;
competitiveness. The price indeces for C6te d'Ivoire's principal exports (all of which are agricultural&#13;
commodities) fell precipitously and negative Terms of Trade (TOT) trends were most severe for its two&#13;
most important exports, cocoa and coffee. Regarding cocoa, this was partly due to faulty pricing policies&#13;
which over-encouraged cocoa production, causing a glut in world markets, and speculation on the&#13;
international market. For all other commodities, C6te d'Ivoire is a price-taker in world markets, and the&#13;
country was hurt by the worldwide fall in primary commodity prices that characterized much of the 1980s&#13;
and early 1990s.&#13;
1.07         TOT evolution is a primary determinant of the real effective exchange rate (REER). From&#13;
1986 to January 1994, the REER appreciated significantly, causing a major decline in the competitiveness&#13;
of Ivorian exports. Under a flexible exchange rate system, the exchange rate automatically adjusts to&#13;
restore the economy to competitiveness and bring major macroeconomic variables back into approximate&#13;
equilibrium. As a member of the CFA franc zone, C6te d'Ivoire's currency is fixed relative to the French&#13;
franc, so any attempt to adjust parity requires an inter-governmental decision. This has not happened until&#13;
January 12, 1994 when the decision was taken to realign the CFA franc parity from CFA franc 50 to CFA&#13;
franc 100 per French franc, or a devaluation of 50 percent in foreign terms.&#13;
1.08         Up to January 12, 1994, C6te d'Ivoire had elected to pursue a policy of internal&#13;
adjustment, adjusting wages and prices, and severely slashing public investment. Internal adjustment&#13;
occurred to varying degrees for major commodity sub-sectors, but it only minimally restored&#13;
competitiveness. Moreover, what little increases in competitiveness that occurred were unsustainable&#13;
because the most important measures taken -- cutting producer prices -- were at the expense of farmers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
For CMte d'lvoire, internal adjustment was a recipe for contraction, not growth. Since farmers are among&#13;
the poorest elements of Ivorian society, such a strategy was also highly inequitable. The above problem is&#13;
being resolved by the change in the parity of CFA franc that has opened the way to a series of major&#13;
reforms notably a substantial raise in producer prices. However, export taxes continue to be heavy.&#13;
C. Export Potential and Constraints to Export Development&#13;
1.09          Potential for Diversification Out of Traditional Export Crops. Since the beginning of the&#13;
60s, the Government has been aware of the necessity to diversify agricultural production to avoid relying&#13;
excessively on cocoa and coffee, the two major export crops, and to promote a greater degree of food self-&#13;
sufficiency. Diversification policies were resolutely proactive. They relied more on the belief of direct&#13;
State intervention to promote infant industries (permitted by comfortable budgetary surpluses) than on&#13;
establishing an enabling environment for private sector expansion. They were supported by large public&#13;
sector investments (particularly for sugar, oil palm and rubber; also for rice; not for pineapple and bananas&#13;
which have always been privately controlled industries), and included a high degree of protection of the&#13;
nascent domestic production. Large parastatals were created to manage the public investments, with&#13;
broader mandate to ensure the socio-economic development in their command areas.&#13;
1.10          Over the years, while production may have developed well technically in some cases, the&#13;
economy of the diversification filieres has clearly deteriorated. Competitiveness was seldom attained, and&#13;
never preserved, because of inflated costs and lack of incentives to streamline operations and increase&#13;
productivity. The Government failed to remove protection that may have been justified in the phase of&#13;
establishment of production, and the attendant distortions that had crept into the filieres. The cash and&#13;
food crop parastatals became gradually plagued with management and financial problems due in part to&#13;
their redundant staff and the multiplicity of the task assigned to them. Their financial deficits grew more&#13;
serious over the years as the Government became less and less able to pay subsidies.&#13;
1.11          The results of diversification efforts to date are mixed, and their scope has remained&#13;
modest in relation to the country's large production base and comparative advantage. The fifieres under&#13;
private control (pineapple and bananas) have suffered greatly from the overvaluation of the REER and the&#13;
lack of an enabling environment. Nevertheless, they have been able to adjust and remain at the cutting edge&#13;
of competitiveness, especially in the case of bananasfiliere in which major efforts have been made to renew&#13;
and expand facilities. It is of no surprise, therefore, that their competitiveness would have improved&#13;
dramatically in the wake of the devaluation. The filieres still controlled by the State are a mixed bag.&#13;
Some filieres have brought in some degree of adjustment in their operations (cotton, rubber) while other&#13;
have largely resisted adjustment (oil palm, sugar). In the wake of the devaluation, most of these fiWibres&#13;
have regained financial profitability. At this time, efforts should aim at consolidating such profitability and&#13;
making it sustainable. This can only be achieved by resolutely moving toward completing the privatization&#13;
of parastatals such as Palmindustrie, etc. as part of broader policies geared to redefining the role of the&#13;
State and of the private sector in agricultural development.&#13;
1.12          Pursuing diversification efforts is a necessity as they are key to ensuring a balanced&#13;
growth of agriculture for the long-term. Diversification should be pursued by broadening the scope for&#13;
activities to non traditional exports destined for the intemational market, and to food crops destined to the&#13;
domestic (or sub-regional) market or to substitute imports (rice in particular).  CMte d'Ivoire has&#13;
undoubtedly a comparative advantage to producing a wide array of non traditional exports.  This&#13;
comparative advantage is due to: (a) its climate which endows the country with the capacity to produce the&#13;
entire range of tropical products that can be found elsewhere at the same latitude in the world; (b) a&#13;
relatively efficient infrastructure base (telecommunications, roads, seaport, airport) that facilitates&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
exchanges with foreign countries; (c) the relative proximity of the vast and expanding European market; (d)&#13;
historical links with the European continent, reflected in the facilities of entry that African products still&#13;
enjoy on this market; and (e) the existence of an agro-industrial base that permits to produce processed and&#13;
semi-processed products.&#13;
1.13          Non traditional exports can be classified into fresh products and processed products.&#13;
There are presently significant exports flows of non traditional agricultural commodities in fresh, and large&#13;
possibilities for expansion of these exports, inter alia: (a) ornamental flowers: CMte d'Ivoire has already&#13;
developed a good image as an exporter for these commodities whose exports are very lucrative; it is worth&#13;
noting that CMte d'Ivoire is the only exporter of ornamental pineapple (ananas fleur) for which there is an&#13;
interesting potential market; (b) fresh fruits: there is a large array of fruits currently produced, or with an&#13;
interesting production potential, suited for export in fresh; this includes mangoes, avocados, guavas,&#13;
papayas, grenadines, passion fruit and mangosteen; at this time, only mangoes are exported in significant&#13;
quantities, and producers are still ill-equipped and ill-organized for production and export of the other&#13;
commodities; (c) fresh vegetables: the European market offers an interesting outlet at certain periods of the&#13;
year for vegetables such as eggplant, chilly, melon and string beans; some Afiican countries have already&#13;
taken advantage of this market; in addition, there is a growing African community in Europe which&#13;
constitutes an incipient but growing outlet for certain tropical vegetables such as the n'drowa variety of&#13;
eggplant, cassava leaves and okra (in fresh or dried form), etc.; and (d) sundry products: with an exported&#13;
volume of 30,000 tons per annum, CMte d'Ivoire is the first exporter of cola nuts in the world; while the&#13;
traditional demand of Sahelian countries is sustained, exports increasingly go as well to the international&#13;
market which is fast expanding especially in dried nuts form; raw cashew nuts have substantial production&#13;
potential and a growing export market; CMte d'Ivoire currently exports about 15,000 tons yearly to the&#13;
international market; with the reopening of the processing unit in Korhogo and the creation of new&#13;
plantations, the quality of production should increase markedly; and silk production (sdriciculture) that&#13;
CIDT started under a pilot operation is testimony that other opportunities for diversification still exist.&#13;
1.14          Traditional food crops also represent an opportunity for diversification, both for the&#13;
domestic and international markets. On the domestic market side, the expansion of urban centers (in&#13;
particular the Abidjan metropolitan area), offers a growing outlet for products of the urban belt (agriculture&#13;
peri-urbaine). The demand concerns in particular cassava and sundry vegetables. While marketing&#13;
systems are fairly well organized, there is large scope for increase in production out of greater&#13;
intensification and better use of organic waste. On the international scene, there is a growing demand for&#13;
African products mostly on the part of African and Caribbean communities living abroad. In recent years,&#13;
market networks have come into existence for such products as yams, plantains, cassava (fresh and in&#13;
processed form such as attieke), okra, chilly, red palm oil, dried fish, etc., for which C6te d'Ivoire has a&#13;
competitive edge over other potential suppliers.&#13;
1.15          Remaining Major Constraints to Export Development and Possible Improvements. The&#13;
potential for export development in CMte d'lvoire continues to suffer from institutional and regulatory as&#13;
well as technical and commercial constraints that constitute important bottlenecks to fully restoring the&#13;
country's competitiveness. On the institutional front, a number of government institutions were established&#13;
during the last few years with the objectives of export promotion. To date, such objectives remain&#13;
unattained because of rigidities in their operations, lack of dynamism to identify foreign buyers' demand for&#13;
Ivorian products and lack of operating means and adequate expertise to conduct business. As a result, the&#13;
Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Chamber of Agriculture and the Centre de Commerce&#13;
International d'Abidjan are all experiencing serious difficulties in providing an effective support to the&#13;
development of the country's exports by private businesses. Regulatory constraints are also known to be&#13;
chiefly responsible for inordinate excessive shipping costs for both sea and air transports due to existing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
monopoly in maritime transport of goods from C6te d'Ivoire and that granted to airliners Air Afrique and&#13;
Air France for all air cargo transports. Transportation and VAT issues are further detailed in paras 1.18&#13;
through 1.24 below.&#13;
1.16          Inadequate professional experience and expertise of producers and exporters are another&#13;
major constraint to developing exports of Ivorian non-traditional agricultural products.  The local&#13;
producers and sellers of non-traditional products, for the most part are relatively small enterprises which&#13;
simply do not have the resources or the experience and expertise to enter into the intemational marketplace&#13;
to identify customers, their needs and requirements or to form necessary business relationships to make&#13;
sales. In general, the Ivorian non traditional and small crop producers are not equipped and experienced in&#13;
conducting market research, identifying potential regional and overseas customers first and then producing&#13;
to meet the specific needs of these customers, and to carrying out the demanding negotiations and pricing&#13;
that is required for successful international business transactions.&#13;
1.17          The most important technical constraints have to do with the poor state of transport&#13;
logistic (e.g., the fruit wharf) and the lack of specialized storage facilities at the harbor and the airport of&#13;
Abidjan for perishables.&#13;
1.18          Transport. Maritime shipping costs from Cote d'Ivoire are extremely high in comparison&#13;
to developing countries and to Africa because of existing monopolistic situations. As agricultural exports&#13;
are the most important foreign exchange earner for the C6te d'Ivoire, seeking ways to lower maritime&#13;
shipping costs is a crucial ingredient of competitiveness. Maritime shipping costs are especially important&#13;
for perishable commodities such as bananas and pineapples, as well as bulky wood products. For such&#13;
commodities, ocean freight currently constitutes 20-30 percent of the CIF price. Government intervention&#13;
dominates the maritime shipping sector, and this has resulted in inefficiencies and elevated costs. C6te&#13;
d'Ivoire has extended the UNCTAD Code of Conduct (40-40-20 rule) meant for conference liner traffic to&#13;
total general traffic (i.e., conference and non conference ) and to bulk and specialized traffic. This practice&#13;
limits competition and increases freight prices, particularly for exporters of bulky products. The Societe&#13;
Ivoirienne des Transports Maritimes (SITRAM), a parastatal, holds the monopoly of Ivorian traffic rights&#13;
between West Africa and Northern Europe, the Atlantic coast of the United States, and on refrigerated and&#13;
bulk transport for all destinations whereas Ivonian traffic rights to mediterranean European ports have been&#13;
granted to the private shipping line SIVOMAR. Freight rates are negotiated by a government dominated&#13;
agency, the Office Ivoirien des Chargeurs (OIC), which also has the responsibility of apportioning cargo&#13;
space to shippers.&#13;
1.19          Up to 1993, the French firm SCAC-Delmas-Vieljeux (SDV) held a defacto monopoly for&#13;
shipping of Ivorian banana and pineapple exports to Europe, as SITRAM owns no refrigerated vessels and&#13;
had passed on its traffic rights to SDV. However, the Banana and Pineapple Exporters' Organization&#13;
(OCAB) resolved not to accept SDV's terms (then US$121 per palette of 900 kg). In December 1993,&#13;
OCAB decided independently to contract two ships via competition and was able to secure a rate as low as&#13;
US$65 perpalette. Faced with OCAB'sfait accompli, the Minister of Transport granted to OCAB -- on&#13;
February 1, 1994 retroactive to the date of signature of the contract -- a special authorization to contract&#13;
ships directly for the 1994 campaign for 50 percent of its shipments.&#13;
1.20          Liberalization of maritime traffic continues to be a major concern of Ivorian exporters. In&#13;
the long-run, C6te d'Ivoire risks continued loss of export market share due to erosion of price&#13;
competitiveness. From 1985 to 1991, the Ivorian share of the EC banana market fell from approximately&#13;
5.3 percent to slightly over 3 percent. Although still the main exporter of fresh pineapple to the EC, CMte&#13;
d'Ivoire has gone from a over 90 percent of market share in 1985 down to just over 60 percent by 1991.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
Every effort needs to be made to lower ocean transport costs through increased competition. Moreover, the&#13;
every day management of the cargo allocation by OIC entails delays, inefficiencies, and opportunities for&#13;
rent-seeking behavior.&#13;
1.21          Under the ERC which became effective in November 1994, the Government has committed&#13;
itself to eliminate restrictive practices in the maritime transport sector. As a result, exporters should be&#13;
allowed to seek direct agreement with shipping companies to take advantage of much better transport rates&#13;
that competition brings about.&#13;
1.22          Against this background, transport monopolies appear to constitute the single most&#13;
important remaining constraint to the competitiveness of Ivorian agricultural export across the board. The&#13;
monopoly enjoyed by the national carrier SITRAM for sea transport, which is indeed aggravated by a&#13;
virtual monopoly and low capacity of Air Afrique/Air France for air cargo transport, result in excessive&#13;
transport costs with deleterious effects on agricultural export operations. An Air Freight Committee was&#13;
recently established to ensure proper planning of exports by air taking into account the limited loading&#13;
capacity of current air carriers and maintain the dialogue with the Government to ascertain a proper follow-&#13;
up of the treatment of the above issues.&#13;
1.23          Value-Added Tax. Current VAT policies and practices and possible future reforms have&#13;
major implications for the competitiveness of agricultural sector exports as the VAT content in the cost&#13;
structure reaches up to 10 percent for some products. A major issue which needs to be addressed is that of&#13;
the extension by option of the field of application of VAT on a number of agricultural, forestry and&#13;
fisheries products destined to exports, thus enabling them to claim the VAT refund on inputs.&#13;
1.24          Under the FY 91 Competitiveness Sector Adjustment Loan (PASCO), exporters for those&#13;
agricultural, fishery and forestry products not yet subjected to VAT were to be allowed to opt for VAT and&#13;
thus be entitled to a credit for VAT paid on their inputs. Under the PASCO second tranche conditionality,&#13;
the Government has accepted to open the VAT option for bananas, pineapples, flowers and ornamental&#13;
plants only, claiming that there are no other major non traditional exports at present. To further improve&#13;
the export incentive framework, it is critical that an undistorted incentive system be established once and&#13;
for all, and that potential non traditional exporters should not have to lobby the Government to get their&#13;
product eligible for VAT option and thus get the VAT refunds to which they are entitled.&#13;
1.25          Prospects for Supporting Export Promotion and Diversification.   C6te d'Ivoire's&#13;
competitiveness for export crops has been greatly enhanced by the recent change in the parity of the CFA&#13;
franc. The actual mobilization of the potential, on a scale that will make a difference, will require on the&#13;
part of national entrepreneurs to make the most out of every single export niche. Support on the part of the&#13;
Government will be required both to strengthen the incentive framework and remove the obstacles to supply&#13;
response. This will include, inter alia: (a) institution building, by strengthening professional organizations;&#13;
(b) improving the fiscal and regulatory framework for export activities; (c) support to export production by&#13;
providing specialized technical services (adaptive research, seed production, etc.); (d) assistance to export&#13;
marketing, in particular assistance to establishment of partnership with foreign investors to secure technical&#13;
expertise, market outlets and financial advisory services for export businesses; and (e)&#13;
rehabilitation/upgrading of export infrastructure at the port and airport. As part of the preparation of the&#13;
proposed project, a pilot operation tested real export opportunities for a number of non traditional crops&#13;
(desiccated coconut, papaya solo, cut flowers, essential oils, etc.) and worked with more than 60&#13;
agricultural producers and their associations over an eighteen-month period. The operation has received an&#13;
enthusiastic response on the part of the above producers especially for commodities such as papaya solo,&#13;
yams and other ethnic food products, as well as for essential oils and desiccated coconut. A few firm&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
orders have been secured and pilot shipments have permitted to test packaging materials and transportation&#13;
methods, in particular containerized transport by sea in controlled atmosphere for papayas and flower&#13;
pineapple (ananas-fleur). The operation has also laid the ground for addressing the air freight problem&#13;
through the establishment of an Air Freight Committee and assisting the development of professional&#13;
organizations for fruits and vegetables and essential oils.  Overall, the results of the operation are&#13;
encouraging, and augur well for the eventual large scale development of non traditional exports. (Annex 1)&#13;
D. Lessons Learned from Past Bank Group Involvement&#13;
1.26         Experience of several developing countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia where&#13;
agricultural export promotion and diversification has been supported by the Bank, has demonstrated that&#13;
even modest success in increasing a country's share of world markets can translate into considerable&#13;
growth. It is also showing that the future is in non traditional exports, while also giving evidence that&#13;
traditional exports still need to be part of an outward-oriented strategy. Moreover, unrestricted access to&#13;
imported inputs, investment licensing, financing and realistic exchange rates proved to constitute critical&#13;
factors in creating an enabling environment for an outward-oriented development benefiting agricultural&#13;
production. An important ingredient for successful entry into the international market has often been the&#13;
presence of a catalytic mechanism that facilitated the establishment of partnerships between local&#13;
agricultural producers and foreign investors and their subsequent response to world market demands. An&#13;
important lesson learned in the failure of developing fruit and vegetable export market in a number of Bank&#13;
export projects has been the lack of identification of customer and product requirements beforehand.&#13;
Foreign market development proved to be an essential ingredient for export promotion projects in Kenya&#13;
and Burundi while excessive complexity and division of responsibility for implementation has been a major&#13;
factor that adversely affected the performance of Kenya's export promotion project.  The above&#13;
considerations are largely taken into account in the proposed project design as most of them are and can be&#13;
met for C6te d'Ivoire.&#13;
II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Strategy and Rationale&#13;
2.01          Strategy. The proposed project would support the Government's outward-oriented strategy&#13;
in favor of agricultural export promotion and diversification. Such a strategy fosters primarily the&#13;
production and marketing of non traditional agricultural products -- as opposed to traditional commodities&#13;
such as coffee, cocoa, cotton and timber -- while paying due regard to traditional exports through seeking&#13;
to enable an overall appropriate and improved incentive and regulatory framework. It relies on the&#13;
Government's recognition that the driving force for growth in the country will come from increased&#13;
agricultural production and export. It also draws on the new opportunities for the restoration of the&#13;
agricultural export sector competitiveness which are now emerging following the CFA franc devaluation of&#13;
January 12, 1994.&#13;
2.02          Major highlights of the Government's strategy involve the following:&#13;
(a)    continued implementation of macroeconomic reforms and specific policy measures being&#13;
carried under relevant ongoing structural and sectoral adjustment operations, to further&#13;
benefit agricultural exports;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
(b)    an "exporters-first" philosophy to be promoted through an improved institutional&#13;
environment to benefit both local and foreign private investors;&#13;
(c)    empowerment of the private sector to implement an export-led strategy without&#13;
Government interference;&#13;
(d)    a clear recognition of the need for establishing an institutional framework in the form of&#13;
trade associations to represent the non traditional producers and the export sector. These&#13;
associations, in addition to providing direct support to their membership in the form of&#13;
training and technical advice, will also represent the agricultural producers/exporters vis-a-&#13;
vis the Government, donors and in the marketplace for promoting Ivorian agricultural&#13;
products; and&#13;
(e)    support to specific actions aimed at: (i) increasing the country's share of exports mainly&#13;
non traditional products; (ii) improving quality and competitiveness of agricultural exports&#13;
through simplifying and/or removing regulatory and logistic constraints to agricultural&#13;
exports; (iii) setting up services to supply market intelligence and secure commercial&#13;
partnerships between local and foreign businesses; (iv) providing credit facilities (not to&#13;
exceed CFA franc 15 million per borrower) to small private agricultural exporters of non-&#13;
traditional products through the establishment of a National Agricultural Promotion and&#13;
Diversification Fund which is a revolving fund with an actual initial appropriation of CFA&#13;
franc 1.25 billion (about US$2.6 million); and (v) ensuring the protection and effective&#13;
management of he country's natural resources.&#13;
2.03          Link with the Sector Adjustment Operations. The present operation would complement a&#13;
number of adjustment operations supported by the Bank, most notably the Competitiveness Adjustment&#13;
Loan (PASCO), the Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (PASFI), the Economic Recovery Credit (ERC) and&#13;
the upcoming Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit (ASAC) and Private Sector Development Credit&#13;
(PSD). Under the PASCO, a number of measures aimed at the promotion of non traditional exports were&#13;
adopted, of which the following are of direct relevance to the proposed operation: (a) settlement by the&#13;
Government of VAT arrears to exporters, i.e., reimbursement of VAT paid on inputs for all eligible&#13;
exports; (b) extension of VAT eligibility (and hence reimbursement of VAT paid on inputs) to certain&#13;
agricultural exports (bananas, pineapples and flowers and plants; extension to other products is scheduled);&#13;
(c) elimination of the statistical tax of 2.5 percent for inputs used in export production; and (d)&#13;
improvement in the system of temporary admission of inputs for export products.&#13;
2.04          More generally, the PASCO  has introduced a series of reforms that facilitate the&#13;
development of private sector activities, like the elimination of price controls (with a few exceptions), the&#13;
reduction of the level and dispersion of tariff rates, the reduction of the number of VAT rates, the&#13;
modification of the Investment and Labor Codes. The upcoming Private Sector Development Credit&#13;
addresses specifically issues of interest to exporters, like the streamlining of customs/port procedures,&#13;
remaining VAT deduction issues, and the reform of export promotion institutions and payment of overdue&#13;
VAT credit arrears. Similarly, the PASFI has contributed to strengthen the financial system through the&#13;
recapitalization of commercial banks, the closing of unprofitable state banks, the securitization of&#13;
government arrears to the banking and insurance sectors and the introduction of legal reforms to facilitate&#13;
the calling of collateral and reduce the cost of legal action. Although term credit to the private sector&#13;
remains a challenge, these measures have contributed to reestablish the confidence of private operators on&#13;
the financial system so as to enable it to play its proper role in the promotion of private sector activities,&#13;
including export promotion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.05          The ERC has been the vehicle for the introduction of reforms in the maritime transport&#13;
sector, aimed at increasing competition in such services and reduce transport costs. Maritime transport&#13;
issues are being resolved under the ERC will thus contribute to create an appropriate incentive framework&#13;
for the success of project activities. These measures are not only of extreme importance to the current&#13;
operation but they will also increase, overall, the competitiveness of Ivorian agricultural exports in foreign&#13;
market.&#13;
2.06          As for the ASAC, it will introduce relevant reform measures in the agricultural sector&#13;
which will aim at liberalizing trade and prices, increasing private sector efficiency and reducing the&#13;
Government's role in the sector. The ASAC will continue to broaden and deepen the trade policy reform&#13;
measures initiated and agreed by the Government under PASCO to help restore the competitiveness of the&#13;
Ivorian economy by: (a) reducing and eventually eliminating any restrictions (licenses, quotas) on the&#13;
importation of agricultural and agro-industial commodities other than those related to health reasons, and&#13;
substitute it by a transparent protection mechanism based on reasonable levels of tariff duties; and (b)&#13;
adjusting the export tax on cocoa and coffee, taking into consideration the fiscal needs of the country. It&#13;
will further support the full liberalization of consumer prices in the agricultural and agro-industrial&#13;
subsectors initiated under the PASCO and the ERC and contribute to streamlining the Government's role in&#13;
the economy. ASAC support to policy actions is being or will be complemented with IDA investment&#13;
operations in agricultural services, rural financial services and export promotion.&#13;
2.07          Given the common interest to deepen the Bank Group's understanding of the constraints to&#13;
dynamic private sector development in C6te d'lvoire, IFC and the Bank had prepared a Private Sector&#13;
Assessment which was discussed with the Government and the private sector in June 1994 during a seminar&#13;
which was used as the launching pad for the upcoming PSD Adjustment Operation. Close coordination&#13;
with IFC of activities to be supported under the project will be further pursued (para 2.22). IFC has been&#13;
involved in textiles, food processing and agribusiness sectors with investments geared to the development of&#13;
export-oriented and import substitution projects and the expansion of small and medium-sized companies.&#13;
Total commitments held by IFC as of March 31, 1995 were about US$86 million. In keeping with the&#13;
economic changes brought about by the recent devaluation, IFC is expected to pursue increasing&#13;
opportunities in agribusinesses in addition to export based manufacturing and small business sectors.&#13;
2.08          In the short-term, the devaluation will also have a more favorable effect on the rural than&#13;
the urban poor. While farmers suffered greatly from declining incomes prior to January 1994, the&#13;
devaluation will provide them with a much needed boost in their incomes through increased producer prices&#13;
which constitute the most efficient and direct means to alleviate poverty in rural areas in the short term.&#13;
While volumes of traditional exports would grow at rates consistent with their international demand,&#13;
rapidly expanding non traditional exports would provide a source of dynamism over the medium to long&#13;
run.&#13;
2.09          As highlighted in the June 1994 CAS, protecting the environment and managing the&#13;
resource base has become a major objective for sustainable development in Cote d'Ivoire. The Government&#13;
is confronted with serious environmental problems such as deforestation, loss of biodiversity, soil&#13;
degradation, water pollution, and management of industrial and domestic waste. The Government has&#13;
drafted a National Environment Action Plan (NEAP) expected to be approved shortly. An Orientation&#13;
Document was already discussed during a seminar held in November 1994.   Following the&#13;
recommendations of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in 1992, this plan&#13;
will be among the first in Africa to address the full range of global as well as national environmental issues.&#13;
To provide greater focus on environmental policy, the Government intends to draw up an environmental&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
code. It will also install and manage an environmental data base to monitor trends in environmental quality&#13;
in both urban and rural areas.&#13;
2.10          Rationale for IDA Involvement. In line with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), the&#13;
proposed project will be a vehicle to support private investment and private sector involvement in&#13;
improving the performance of non traditional exports and streamlining the role of the private professional&#13;
organizations in the agricultural export sector. It fits well in the Bank's post-devaluation country strategy&#13;
as it would complement sectoral reforms initiated under the Economic Recovery Credit (ERC) and to be&#13;
carried out under the future Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit (ASAC) which aim, among other things,&#13;
at liberalizing trade and prices, increasing private sector efficiency and reducing the Government's role in&#13;
the economy. Combined with an appropriate institutional and regulatory framework which will be in place&#13;
under the Government's planned strategy, the project is further anticipated to be an important catalyst for&#13;
increased private sector involvement in agricultural promotion and diversification.&#13;
B. Project Objectives and Summary Description&#13;
2.11          Project Obiectives. The project's objectives would be to diversify and expand agricultural&#13;
exports and sales and contribute to private sector development, with a view to supporting the Government's&#13;
export-led growth strategy, primarily through: (a) export promotion and diversification actions oriented&#13;
primarily toward the growth of non traditional agricultural products and the development of markets for&#13;
such products by scaling up actions initiated under a pilot phase; (b) strengthening existing associations of&#13;
agricultural producers/exporters and promoting the establishment of an interprofessional group of&#13;
producers/exporters' associations and the creation of new farmer associations; and (c) upgrading of critical&#13;
export handling facilities. The diversification of agricultural exports is further intended to contribute to&#13;
reducing the country's excessive dependence on traditional crops such as cocoa, coffee and timber.&#13;
2.12          Project Summary Description. In support of the above objectives, the project would have&#13;
the following components:&#13;
(a)    Export Promotion and Diversification. Actions through assisting Ivorian producers in: (i)&#13;
market research, customer identification, meeting quality requirements, trial shipments and obtaining pre-&#13;
export finance and follow-up of sales and export shipment; (ii) product development and quality control via&#13;
adaptive research; (iii) establishment of business partnerships for private operators engaging in the&#13;
production and export of products proven to have an important export potential for the country, such as&#13;
desiccated coconut, cashew nut, tropical cut flowers and potted plants, essential oils and fruits and&#13;
vegetables etc. This component, which will be a scaled-up version of the pilot project (November 1993&#13;
through April 1995), will provide hands-on assistance to producers/exporters in identifying regional and&#13;
overseas buyers and in making sales contracts. It will assist in establishing Ivorian brands, logos and&#13;
labels/packaging. Financial advisory services and training for entrepreneurs in the agricultural export&#13;
sector will also be provided to facilitate access to the banking sector's facilities through assistance in&#13;
preparing credit applications and helping secure export financing and guarantee arrangements, especially&#13;
for smaller agricultural export businesses. The project would thus help establish a necessary link to&#13;
encourage financing by local banks and foreign commercial partners and enhance producers/exporters'&#13;
knowledge in cost accounting and export finance;&#13;
(b)    Support to Producers/Exporters' Organizations by strengthening existing privately-&#13;
controlled professional organizations: producer groups, exporter associations, cooperatives, etc., and&#13;
promoting the creation of new farmer associations and the establishment of an Interprofessional Group of&#13;
Producers' and Exporters' Associations. The interprofessional group of associations will not only represent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
the interests of its members but is expected to become the major vehicle for non traditional export market&#13;
development;&#13;
(c)    Upgrading of Export Facilities through rehabilitating the infrastructure in critical areas&#13;
such as the existing fruit wharf in the Port of Abidjan and undertaking minor works for handling and&#13;
specialized storage facilities at the airport for allowing better transit conditions for the export of perishable&#13;
produce. This component will be carried out under parallel financing from grants of the European Union;&#13;
and&#13;
(d)    Support to Project Management which will be carried out by qualified private&#13;
professionals experienced in agricultural export and farmer organization as was done efficiently during the&#13;
pilot phase.&#13;
C. Detailed Project Description&#13;
1. Export Promotion and Diversification Actions&#13;
2.13          The results of pilot activities, which preceded the project and were designed to test actual&#13;
export sales and market development operations and possibilities for agricultural diversification by a&#13;
sample of over 60 enterprises, have indicated that an important potential for export exists in CMte d'Ivoire&#13;
for non traditional products such as desiccated coconut, cut flowers and potted plants, essential oils and&#13;
fruits and vegetables, cashew nut, cola nut, etc. as detailed in the matrices in Annex 1. The pilot phase&#13;
tested successfully, over an eighteen-month period, a methodology which focused on assuring that the&#13;
buyers on regional and overseas markets are identified first, that their needs and requirements are translated&#13;
back to Ivorian producers and that the producers can successfully meet the needs of buyers.&#13;
2.14          The methodology also ensured that support is provided for demand-driven services&#13;
requested by producers and exporters of non-traditional products. The pilot operation has further been&#13;
instrumental in hosting a large number of requests for market identification services which were being&#13;
sought from various donors and defining a coherent approach for seeking solutions to common problems&#13;
experienced by producers and exporters of non traditional products with respect to establishing business&#13;
relationships with foreign buyers, product quality improvement, etc. It has received an enthusiastic&#13;
response on the part of the above producers and exporters. The methodology is now well established and&#13;
will be scaled up during the project implementation period.&#13;
2.15          Results of Pilot Operation. The pilot project's methodology involved working one-on-one&#13;
with Ivorian producers and exporters to develop export sales and markets for non traditional agricultural&#13;
products. The Ivorian clients served by the pilot project range from fairly sophisticated operations which&#13;
are technology and know-how intensive to inexperienced entrepreneurs who have nevertheless a vision of&#13;
serving export markets with locally produced agricultural products. The pilot operation has also laid the&#13;
ground for addressing the air freight problem through the establishment of an Air Freight Committee and&#13;
assisting the development of professional organizations for fruits and vegetables and essential oils.&#13;
2.16          Just as the clients served by the pilot project are diverse so are the services provided by the&#13;
pilot project's professional staff. These services range from international market research to participation&#13;
in international trade shows alongside the Ivorian producers and exporters. In addition, the staff provides a&#13;
wide range of strategic and business planning and advisory services which would otherwise be unavailable&#13;
to local business people. Farmer organization and arrangements for adaptive research have also been&#13;
major areas of assistance. The pilot phase further demonstrated that there does exist a demand from the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
private Ivorian producers and exporters for the full range of services described above, and that it can be&#13;
scaled up as it currently operates to continue achieving 'bottom line" results for Ivorian producers and&#13;
exporters.&#13;
2.17          In view of its positive results, the pilot activities will be scaled up during the project&#13;
implementation period. Producers and processors of the above high-value commodities would continue to&#13;
benefit from project assistance to match their request for the above services and for other services including&#13;
research on product development and quality enhancement and control, advice on acquiring new and&#13;
improved genetic materials as well as other inputs and the required information on their appropriate usage&#13;
will be also provided to producers. Overall quality enhancement, including intemational standard&#13;
certification and product quality management and modem food quality and safety standards, is expected to&#13;
ensure high quality export products under the project. Assistance in the establishment of business&#13;
relationships and market development will also be a major project action.&#13;
2.18          Detailed eligibility criteria and cost sharing by project beneficiaries are presented in Annex&#13;
4. Project beneficiaries under the above component will be primarily Ivorian businesses and corporations&#13;
governed by Ivorian law as well as producers/exporters' associations and professional organizations. They&#13;
will be producers and exporters who have demonstrated the basic technical know-how and mastered&#13;
production requirements. Eligible activities will include: market development and market research;&#13;
feasibility studies; research on product promotion, quality control, processing and storage; product&#13;
shipping tests and financial advisory services and training to prepare sound financial packages and provide&#13;
advice and training in simple accounting and business management. The project will contribute to promote&#13;
those products for which a demand and/or market are proven to exist so that project action ensures the&#13;
attainment of improved production and product quality along with the mastery of export operations.&#13;
Project beneficiaries will contribute to direct costs associated with their requested operations to the tune of&#13;
40 percent for promotion actions and market research, 40 percent for financial advisory services and 20&#13;
percent for adaptive research. In order to benefit an optimal number of producers/exporters, specific limits&#13;
on total project funding to any single beneficiary over the implementation period will be observed by the&#13;
project management; these will not exceed the equivalent of US$25,000 and US$50,000 respectively for&#13;
individual businesses and corporations and US$100,000 for producers/exporters' associations and&#13;
professional organizations. The support on behalf of a single beneficiary under the project will be normally&#13;
limited to two actions or three in exceptional cases.&#13;
2.19          Support to Non-Traditional Export Crop Market Development. This will be provided&#13;
under the project through assisting Ivorian producers in: (a) market research, customer identification,&#13;
meeting quality requirements, trial shipments and packaging assistance, and obtaining pre-export finance&#13;
and follow-up of sales and export shipments; (b) product development and quality control via adaptive&#13;
research; and (c) establishment of business relationships for private operators engaging in the production&#13;
and export of products proven to have an important export potential for the country, such as desiccated&#13;
coconut, cashew nut, tropical cut flowers and potted plants, essential oils and fruits and vegetables etc.&#13;
This component will provide assistance to producers/exporters in identifying regional and overseas buyers&#13;
and in making sales contracts. The exploration of new markets in the region and overseas and the&#13;
development of new products would also be undertaken through product market promotion activities&#13;
including participation and booking stalls in fairs abroad. Moreover, market information systems will be&#13;
initiated under the project by the Project Coordinator to have instant access to commodity prices, grading&#13;
and packaging requirements as well as demand and supply indicators. During project implementation,&#13;
alternatives will be explored to maintain such systems. Additional market development work will be&#13;
carried out under this component to establish Ivorian brands, logos and labels/packaging to carry through&#13;
with the identity and image of Ivorian product quality. In addition, to enhance the exporters' knowledge of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
international trade, workshops on export and international trade regulations will be organized using&#13;
expertise of international specialized institutions such as COLEACP (Comite de Liaison Europe, Afrique,&#13;
Caraibes), the International Trade Center (ITC), etc.&#13;
2.20          Financial Advisory Services and Training. Typically, smaller agricultural enterprises in&#13;
CMte d'Ivoire lack access to formal financial services. This situation has not changed despite the&#13;
overliquidity position of the country's banking sector following the change in parity of the local currency&#13;
since January 1994. The banks' risk aversion is particularly important for new businesses as will be the&#13;
case for many project beneficiaries engaged in non traditional crops. Indeed, such businesses normally do&#13;
not have a robust track record nor the experience in putting together sound financial arrangements. During&#13;
the pilot phase, however, the banking sector has been responsive when such businesses were introduced and&#13;
followed up by the Project Coordination team's financial staff. Hence, the provision of financial advisory&#13;
services to help prepare sound financial packages is included in the project and expected to continue to&#13;
make these businesses more attractive to the banks.&#13;
2.21          To meet the standards of banks and intemational financial institutions, between two and&#13;
three person/months of specialist inputs are usually required for finalizing packages including adequate&#13;
technical, market and financiaUeconomic analyses and securing business partnerships and funding. The&#13;
unit cost of such services per dossier may be as high as $100,000 when provided by most major&#13;
international consulting firms or financial agencies while the project will secure the basic expertise required&#13;
to perfonn such activities cost-effectively.&#13;
2.22          As IFC has a long-standing relationship with CMte dIvoire and has been involved in&#13;
export-oriented projects (para 2.07), project beneficiaries who may be eligible for APDF's services and/or&#13;
IFC's lending will be referred to those agencies. The project has indeed established a close working&#13;
relationship with APDF - a UNDP project with IFC as executing agency and ADB as regional sponsor --&#13;
which is providing advisory services to medium and larger enterprises with the objective of helping African&#13;
entrepreneurs develop viable projects. It is also considering with IFC, through the Africa Enterprise Fund&#13;
(AEF) which finances projects costing between $250,000 and $5 million, ways to involve the latter in&#13;
taking equity participation in some promising non traditional producer/exporter businesses. It is also&#13;
working directly with producers and exporters of essential oils, cashew nut and fruits which are benefiting&#13;
from IFC's lending. By focusing on smaller enterprises, the project activities will contribute to widen the&#13;
array of advisory services available to agricultural producers/exporters and rather complement those of&#13;
structures such as APDF. The wealth of infornation gained by the project on the sector's businesses is&#13;
further proving to be extremely important in complementing IFC/APDF's knowledge of smaller businesses.&#13;
2.23          The Government's National Agricultural Promotion and Diversification Fund (para 2.02),&#13;
which is one of the many government funds directed at segments such as small businesses, school leavers&#13;
and women's enterprises, will be an additional source of funding to be raised by smaller exporters for the&#13;
next couple of years. This is likely to be a temporary source of funding since the Government is&#13;
considering to revisit by December 1997 its credit and fund policies and the suitability of instruments to&#13;
support them. Following the Agricultural Sector Review and ASAC discussions, the Government concurred&#13;
that no additional allocation to the Fund will be made; a comprehensive review of the role and performance&#13;
of the Fund will be carried out by December 31, 1997.&#13;
2.24          The availability of financial advisory services under the project will help foster those&#13;
operations whose economic viability, financial sustainability and environmental soundness are established.&#13;
Thus, assistance to help smaller exporters in obtaining pre- and post-shipment finance from banks would be&#13;
provided together with training and advisory services for preparing credit applications and helping secure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
other export financing arrangements, especially for smaller agricultural export businesses. By providing&#13;
enterprise-specific advisory services to and assisting smaller exporters in structuring sound financial&#13;
arrangements as part of their project designs, the project would help establish a useful link for obtaining&#13;
financing by foreign commercial partners in addition to local banks. Training will also be provided to&#13;
enhance those businesses' knowledge in cost accounting and export finance. The project's financial&#13;
specialist will be in charge of the above advisory and training services. For areas requiring special skills,&#13;
he will resort to competent specialized firms' assistance which is available locally. To this effect, short&#13;
term consultancies will be provided under the project.&#13;
2.25          Adaptive Research and Extension. Adaptive research will be conducted to find solutions&#13;
to agricultural producers and exporters' concerns in areas such as production techniques, post harvest&#13;
storage, product processing and packaging. Specific research priorities and subjects will, among other&#13;
things, cover the following: (a) desiccated coconut: quality upgrade and control to match export&#13;
requirements; (b) essential oils: refinery techniques and quality control; (c) cashew nuts: kernel extraction,&#13;
improved salting and grilling techniques; (d) cola nut: storage and drying techniques; (e) tropical cut-&#13;
flowers and potted plants: storage techniques and development of new varieties; and (f) tropical fruits and&#13;
off-season vegetables: processing techniques, extended storage and transport conditions, development of&#13;
new varieties. Research studies will be contracted out through short term consultancy assignments to&#13;
qualified individual researchers and national research institutions.&#13;
2.26          IDEFOR -- one of the major local research institutions -- has developed the required&#13;
expertise in the above research activities mostly for produces such as lime, cashew nut, pepper,&#13;
mangosteen, papaya and mango. Unfortunately, due to financial constraints, most of these activities were&#13;
reduced these past years. Under the project, annual research programs will be relaunched and established&#13;
in close liaison with producers/exporters and their professional organizations with the objectives that these&#13;
beneficiaries bear part of the cost -- through contributions in kind including inputs and labor on trial farms&#13;
and cash for about 20 percent of the cost -- and continue to negotiate directly with the research institutions.&#13;
To procure the technical assistance and the specialized service, the research institutions could enter into&#13;
contracts with a few reliable private larger producers and cooperatives, with a view to conducting trials in&#13;
real conditions on their farms. As vegetables and legumes have not been part of their area of concentration&#13;
of local research institutions, a partnership arrangement between IDEFOR and CIRAD or another&#13;
international research institution would be worked out to secure a qualified researcher who will be stationed&#13;
in the field for a two-year period during which he would be paired with a local researcher who will take&#13;
over the research activities to the completion of the project.&#13;
2.27          For a long time SODEFEL (the Ivorian Agency for Fruit and Vegetable Promotion) was&#13;
the main company in charge of horticultural extension. After the dismantling of SODEFEL in 1992,&#13;
extension activities were entrusted to CIDV (the Ivorian Agency for Food Crop Promotion), replaced by&#13;
ANADER, a mixed company, established in 1993 under the IDA-financed National Agricultural Services&#13;
Support Project (Cr. 2636-VC). ANADER is now the Government's principal implementing agency with&#13;
regard to extension, adaptive research and support to farmers' organizations. To allow small farmers meet&#13;
export standard requirements, specialized management and technical support will be needed. In this regard,&#13;
the project would contribute to develop expertise in horticulture within ANADER to carry out this&#13;
specialized extension program. As was the case under other Bank's operations, contractual arrangements&#13;
will be made with ANADER under the proposed project.&#13;
2.28          Total costs of the above component for Export Promotion and Diversification Actions&#13;
which will be financed under the project amount to US$6.26 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2. Support to Agricultural Producers' and Exporters' Organizations&#13;
2.29          Under the project, support will be provided to promote the establishment of agricultural&#13;
professional organizations specialized in a particular product or group of products and to groups of&#13;
homogeneous producers. Similarly, the strengthening of existing organizations will also be supported.&#13;
This will help the Government implement its Agricultural Export Promotion and Diversification Policy&#13;
through promoting privately-controlled organizations including producer groups, exporter associations,&#13;
cooperatives, etc. To this end, the project would provide the required assistance through national and&#13;
international consultancies.&#13;
2.30          Support to the Development of Professional Associations. Because of the current low&#13;
efficiency and level of organization of key agricultural professional organizations, project assistance will&#13;
focus on strengthening and fostering the development of those existing organizations and helping establish&#13;
new ones for producers involved in non traditional export crops. In the initial phase, project efforts will be&#13;
concentrated on producers involved in non traditional crops with high export potential including primarily&#13;
commodities such as fresh cut flowers and potted plants (UPHCI), tropical fruits and vegetables (UPEFL),&#13;
essential oils (APEPCI), etc.&#13;
2.31          Services of a farmer organization specialist will be made available under the project&#13;
through technical assistance for a period not to exceed three years to help establish agricultural producer's&#13;
and exporter's associations involved in the above crops. Such an action will be complemented by&#13;
management and legal assistance required for the formal establishment of nascent associations and by&#13;
assistance in developing their work programs and training their members in simplified cost accounting and&#13;
management principles.&#13;
2.32          The project will also provide technical support covering the provision of advice on export&#13;
quality requirements and grading norms, labels, market development/representations, planning of air&#13;
shipments and adaptive research through contracting out the execution of such services by local and&#13;
international institutions and NGOs specializing in these fields.&#13;
2.33          Project assistance will be in inverse proportion to the degree of organization of beneficiary&#13;
associations. The project's assistance will be required in all of the above areas for newly created&#13;
associations involved in non traditional export such as UPEFL (est. 1993) and the association of essential&#13;
oil producers (APEPCI) which has been recently created.&#13;
2.34          Strengthening of agricultural producers' and exporters' associations. Producers of non&#13;
traditional export crops have imnportant common interests in dealing with major export issues but the very&#13;
diverse nature and division of their activities lead them to seek crop specific solutions only which are giving&#13;
little dividends.  This situation has resulted in a weak bargaining and lobbying capability affecting&#13;
individual producer groups in representing their interests. Following extensive discussions and several&#13;
roundtables organized by interested exporter groups and governmental agencies, and in light of experience&#13;
gained under the pilot phase, it was felt by such groups that forming themselves, over time, into an&#13;
interprofessional group of agricultural exporters' associations could be a relevant structure to better&#13;
represent them, address their concems with regard to the main constraints to export development and&#13;
diversification, and engage in trade lobbying actions. The interprofessional group will also be responsible&#13;
for proposing norms, standards and labels for quality products and arranging promotion campaigns as well&#13;
as market development actions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16-&#13;
2.35           Apart from OCAB1 which is efficiently organized and self-reliant but deals with banana&#13;
and pineapple only, no other producer association has yet achieved an adequate level of development in&#13;
C6te d'lvoire. Moreover, there is no such association capable of implementing the promotion and technical&#13;
support being envisaged under the proposed project. Hence, promotion and strengthening of agricultural&#13;
professional organizations will be an important initial action to be carried out under the project. This will&#13;
also be a basis to draw upon for current and future membership in the interprofessional group of&#13;
agricultural exporters' associations.&#13;
2.36           An appropriate legal framework exists in CMte d'Ivoire for the establishment of such an&#13;
interprofessional group which will be governed by the laws of September 21, 1960 and December 26, 1974&#13;
on civil and trade associations. Once formally established, the interprofessional group of agricultural&#13;
producers and exporters' association will be a major vehicle for promoting non traditional agricultural&#13;
exports.  Its members will be constituted by existing professional associations involved in agricultural&#13;
production and export and/or related activities who will be free to join and membership will be extended to&#13;
such future associations. The establishment of the interprofessional group is likely, however, to take&#13;
between two to three years to become effective as it will have to draw upon a foundation of fairly weak&#13;
existing professional organizations yet to be strengthened. The required process of training, sensitization&#13;
and education of future member associations will be undertaken under the project.&#13;
2.37           In addition to representing the interests of its members and engaging in the trade lobbying&#13;
actions, other major advantages of the establishment of the interprofessional group would include: (a)&#13;
ensuring the sustainability of project action once the project is over since the interprofessional group will be&#13;
a permanent professional organization; and (b) ensuring that an institutional capacity which may be used as&#13;
a vehicle for coordinating and implementing other possible donor assistance is in place. Indeed, an&#13;
interprofessional group must not become an instrument to create barriers to new entrants or limit&#13;
competition and its statutes will include limitations to prevent such a situation. During negotiations&#13;
assurances were obtained that a feasibility study would be carried out to determine the need to establish the&#13;
inter professional group and specify the modalities of its finctioning. The terms of reference for the study&#13;
would be agreed upon with IDA and the recommendations of the study will be implemented in agreement&#13;
with IDA.&#13;
2.38            Under the project, assistance and short-term consultancies will be provided to promote the&#13;
formal establishment of the interprofessional group through legal advice to prepare its statutes and&#13;
operating principles and assistance for establishing the manual of procedures and an accounting system.&#13;
Investment costs including technical assistance, office fittings and equipment and operating costs for the&#13;
above component are estimated at US$2.88 million.&#13;
1 OCAB is a producer's association fully established (in 1992) under the 1960 Association Act and constituted by 20 export&#13;
structures comprising cooperatives, associations and corporations. It has a modem and effective management structure&#13;
including a general assembly, a board, a management committee and an executive secretary in charge of day-to-day&#13;
management. OCAB represents its members vis-a-vis the government authority and defines the code of ethics for its&#13;
members. Its other main finctions include: (a) coordination of production and exports on the basis of the demand in foreign&#13;
markets, (b) promotion of Ivorian fruits on foreign markets, (c) negotiation of shipping contracts, and (d) assuring quality&#13;
control and fruit packaging.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3. Export Facilities Upgrading&#13;
2.39          During project preparation and processing extensive discussions with the Government and&#13;
producers/exporters including OCAB -- the most developed and influential private export professional&#13;
organization of the country -- concluded that there is a dire need for improving the country's export&#13;
infrastructure through rehabilitating the fruit wharf and securing additional handling and storage facilities&#13;
for fresh produces at Abidjan airport. Construction of a new wharf was not found to be warranted and&#13;
viable in view of the current level of transactions involving 339,000 palettes in 1994. However, the&#13;
rehabilitation of the existing wharf is increasingly becoming critical in view of its steady deterioration&#13;
during the last several decades and subsequent difficult handling conditions and costs. The management of&#13;
the wharf which is currently under the responsibility of OCAB which subcontracted it to SMPA -- a private&#13;
handling service -- will be maintained following the planned rehabilitation. The Port Autonome of Abidjan&#13;
who owns the wharf will continue to levy the harbor tax currently ranging between CFA franc 5 to 7 per kg&#13;
of exported product and use these revenues for maintaining the rehabilitated wharf.&#13;
2.40          Current export facilities at the Abidjan airport are also acknowledged to be inappropriate&#13;
for temporary transit and storage required before shipment of fresh produces such as fruits, vegetables and&#13;
flowers and especially for perishables which cannot stand maritime transport or because they may not be in&#13;
volumes that warrant such a means of conveyance. To cope with this problem which is further aggravated&#13;
by frequent delays and cancellations of air flights with deleterious effects on fresh produces, the&#13;
construction of additional handling and specialized storage facilities for fresh produces at the airport will&#13;
need to be undertaken during project execution. Airport infrastructure upgrade will be managed by the&#13;
airport authority ANAM (Agence Nationale de l'Aviation Civile et de la Met6orologie) which will also&#13;
collect the required fees for maintenance and subsequent rehabilitation. The following activities will be&#13;
carried out under the project:&#13;
(a)    Studies to (i) define the exact scope and timetable of the infrastructure rehabilitation work&#13;
for the fruit wharf in the Abidjan harbor, and (ii) demonstrate the feasibility of the&#13;
establishment of additional handling and specialized storage facilities for fresh fruit at the&#13;
airport; and&#13;
(b)    Execution of rehabilitation works in the existing fruit wharf at the Port of Abidjan for&#13;
producer groups, and the construction of handling and specialized storage facilities for&#13;
export of fresh products at the airport. Major rehabilitation works pertaining to the fruit&#13;
wharf will involve improvement of the flushing and draining systems, strengthening of the&#13;
dike and platform slope, refurbishing of existing merchandise sheds, etc.&#13;
2.41          The total cost of the above component is estimated at US$3.74 million and will be financed&#13;
through grants of the European Union.&#13;
4. Project Management&#13;
2.42          Details on project management and implementation arrangements are presented in the&#13;
Project Organization and Management, chapter IV. The costs associated with project management&#13;
estimated at US$1.52 million will be financed under the project.&#13;

III. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
A. Project Cost Estimates&#13;
3.01           Total project cost (including direct taxes of US$1.73 million), is estimated at about&#13;
US$16.40 million or CFA 7.89 billion, of which US$7.50 million or 46 percent is foreign exchange. Prices&#13;
are as of April/May 1995. Cost estimates do not include the contributions to the equity of exporting&#13;
enterprises which would be made by owners or would-be owners. They include the cost of project&#13;
preparation work for: (a) activities financed under the IDA PPF for a total US$400,000, which are being&#13;
carried out and would be refinanced under the credit; (b) Canadian technical assistance financed from a&#13;
grant from CIDA for a total equivalent to US$ 1 million; and (c) activities financed under a Japanese grant&#13;
for a total equivalent to US$0.6 million. Price contingencies have been calculated on the basis of foreign&#13;
inflation rates of 1.5 percent for 1995, 1.8 percent for 1996, 2.6 percent for 1997, 2.5 percent for 1998&#13;
through 2000, and local inflation rates of 8 percent for 1995, 3.2 percent for 1996, 3.0 percent for 1997&#13;
and afterward. Physical contingencies of 10 percent have been calculated on the cost of equipment and&#13;
infrastructure. All disbursements by IDA would be net of taxes. Project cost estimates are summarized&#13;
below. Details are presented in Annex 6.&#13;

B. Project Financing&#13;
3.02           In addition to the IDA Credit of US$5.83 million (35.6 percent of project costs), financing&#13;
would be provided by other cofinanciers including CIDA (20.9 percent) and the European Union (22.8&#13;
percent), on the basis of parallel financing. About US$0.6 million (3.7per cent) financed preparation work&#13;
under Japan's grant for agricultural export promotion. CIDA has indicated its interest to cover the cost of&#13;
additional expatriate expertise from Canada that would be required during project execution in addition to&#13;
its participation during the project preparation. Similarly, the European Union is interested in financing the&#13;
proposed fruit wharf rehabilitation and handling and specialized storage facilities for perishables at the&#13;
airport. The project would not result in a major demand on public funds: the Government will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
responsible for taxes and duties and part of operating costs for a total of US$1.09 million (6.7 percent).&#13;
Producers and exporters would also share in the costs to the tune of US$1.71 million (10.4 percent); their&#13;
contribution represents up to 18 percent of total project costs excluding bilateral technical assistance and&#13;
infrastructure financed through grants. Assurances on the project cost sharing were obtained at&#13;
Negotiations. The project financing plan is as follows:&#13;

3.03          Project Sustainability. The project would enhance the capacity of the agricultural export&#13;
sector to respond to the country's export promotion and diversification objectives. Through strengthening&#13;
farmer organizations and helping establish an interprofessional group of such organizations, the project&#13;
would contribute to build a local capacity that would further ensure that actions initiated under the project&#13;
are carried out and pursued upon project completion. Effective and sustainable farmer participation will be&#13;
assured as producers and exporters will be voting and paying members of their existing and future&#13;
professional organizations and of the interprofessional group that they will own and from which they will&#13;
demand high levels of continuous services. Project benefits will be also maintained after project completion&#13;
in view of the importance of the private sector's effective involvement and participation in project activities&#13;
and costs.&#13;
C. Procurement&#13;
3.04          C6te d'Ivoire's procurement regulations were a major constraint to the implementation of&#13;
Bank-financed projects because of delays due to extended reviews by governmental  agencies of&#13;
procurement procedures including invitation to bid, evaluation, and contract award. In June 1993,&#13;
following a comprehensive review of the country's procurement regulations carried out during the Country&#13;
Implementation Review (CIR), the Government decided to cut down on time required for internal reviews&#13;
and adapt its procurement documents to be consistent with Bank's guidelines in Bank-financed projects.&#13;
The Prime Minister's office and the Ministry of Finance have also issued written instructions (letter of July&#13;
28, 1994) imposing strict monitorable deadlines at each step of internal reviews by their officials involved&#13;
in procurement. These measures are expected to improve substantially procurement implementation in the&#13;
country.&#13;
3.05          Under the project, contracts for consultancy services for technical assistance, for studies&#13;
and training by local and international consultants would be made in accordance with Bank's guidelines for&#13;
consulting services. Vehicles, for a total amount of US$0.24 million and numbering 10 in total, can only&#13;
be packaged in small lots of 2-3 units and will be procured at about 2 years interval under National&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
Competitive Bidding (NCB) method of procurement. Office equipment for a total amount of USS0.16&#13;
million and publicity and informative materials for a total amount of US$0.17 million will also be procured&#13;
through NCB. National Shopping (NS) with quotations from at least three reputable firms will be used&#13;
only for miscellaneous equipment and some of individual computers for contract values less than $20,000&#13;
and an aggregate value of US$0.10 million. Purchase of fuel, consumables and materials required for&#13;
operating vehicles and equipment throughout the project and up to an aggregate amount of $200,000 will&#13;
be procured by direct purchase. Contracts for stall renting and occupancy at foreign trade fairs for a total&#13;
of amount US$0.17 million will be made on the basis of direct contracting since such costs are&#13;
predetermined by the host countries. International Competitive Bidding (ICB) will be used for all contracts&#13;
for goods of US$200,000 or more.&#13;
3.06         The proposals for advertising, draft bidding documents, bid evaluation, and award&#13;
proposals for contracts for goods of US$100,000 or more, individual consultants of US$50,000 or more&#13;
and consulting firms for US$100,000 or more would be subject to prior review by IDA. The review&#13;
process would cover about 80 percent for goods and of the total value of contracts financed by IDA. An&#13;
IDA selective post-review of awarded contracts below the thresholds would be done for about 1 in 4&#13;
contracts for both goods and services.&#13;
3.07         The Project Management would be in charge of carrying out project procurement.&#13;
Procurement information would be collected and recorded as follows:&#13;
(a)    prompt reporting of contract award information by the Project Management; and&#13;
(b)    comprehensive quarterly and annual reports to IDA by the Project Management,&#13;
indicating:&#13;
(i)   revised cost estimates for individual contracts and the total project;&#13;
(ii)   revised timing of procurement actions including advertising, bidding, contract&#13;
award, and completion time for individual contracts; and&#13;
(iii)   compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement.&#13;
3.08         Assurances on the procurement arrangements were obtained from  Government at&#13;
Negotiations. Contracts for pre-project consultancy services by local and international consultants were&#13;
financed from the proceeds of a Japanese grant for agricultural export promotion and of PPFs for the&#13;
project. The procurement implementation schedule is presented in Annex 8. The planned procurement is&#13;
summarized in the following table:&#13;

3.10          To ensure that funds for project implementation are available as and when needed, a&#13;
Special Account in local currency would be established at CAA with an initial deposit equivalent to&#13;
US$350,000, to cover about four months of expenditures, to be withdrawn from the Credit Account after&#13;
Credit effectiveness. The Special Account would be replenished monthly or more often when the total&#13;
disbursed amounts to one third of the initial deposit, whichever is sooner. Disbursements will be fully&#13;
documented except for expenditures for operating costs, training and contracts for goods and consulting&#13;
firms costing less than US$100,000 equivalent. Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) will also be used for&#13;
contracts for individual consultants costing less than US$50,000 equivalent. The training program will be&#13;
included in the Annual Work Program (para. 4.04) and approved annually. All expenditures above 20&#13;
percent of the initial deposit to the Special Account would be eligible for direct payment by IDA. All&#13;
supporting documents will be retained by the Project Management and made readily available for review by&#13;
periodic IDA supervision missions and external auditors.&#13;
3.11          A Project Account in local currency will also be opened at CAA for the Government to&#13;
deposit its share of funding. The requirements in local currency to be provided by the Government will be&#13;
established yearly and advances will also be made yearly on the basis of disbursement forecasts for the next&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23 -&#13;
twelve months. Replenishments will be made no later than March 31 of each year. Assurances were&#13;
obtained on the above at Negotiations. Opening of the Project Account at CAA with an initial deposit of&#13;
CFA franc 100 million will be a condition of Credit Effectiveness.&#13;
3.12          The Credit funds are expected to be disbursed faster than the standard disbursement profile&#13;
for agricultural projects in C6te d'Ivoire, in view of the shorter implementation period for this operation&#13;
which, in essence, is a private sector support operation including institution building and time-bound&#13;
technical assistance. Disbursements are expected to be completed by June 30, 2001.&#13;
E. Accounting, Financial Reporting, and Auditing Arrangements&#13;
3.13          The Project Management would establish and maintain separate project accounts in&#13;
accordance with internationally recognized accounting principles and practices satisfactory to IDA. It&#13;
would provide interim and annual financial statements to reflect its financial position and that of the&#13;
project. All project accounts, the special account and financial statements would be audited by independent&#13;
auditors acceptable to IDA. The audit report would specifically include the auditors' opinion on the Special&#13;
Account and on the reliability of Statement of Expenditures (SOEs) as a basis for IDA credit disbursement.&#13;
The audit report would also include an assessment as to whether goods and services have been procured&#13;
from eligible sources, and an opinion on the proper utilization of goods and services under the project. The&#13;
auditors' reports would further include a statement on the adequacy or otherwise of the accounting system&#13;
and internal controls. The cost of audit would be paid from the IDA Credit. The audited statements,&#13;
accounts, auditors' long-form reports and short-form opinion reports would be submitted to IDA not later&#13;
than six months after the end of each fiscal year. Assurances to the above audit requirements were&#13;
obtained at Negotiations. The appointment of auditors satisfactory to IDA will be a condition of Credit&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
IV. PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
A. Project Implementation Arrangements&#13;
4.01          Since the project early preparation stages, the Government has agreed to the principle of&#13;
project management by private professionals involved in agricultural export. This materialized through&#13;
setting up a Project Coordination Unit fully staffed with qualified and experienced professionals with&#13;
private employment status for project preparation. This team including a coordinator/project manager and&#13;
two senior local professionals who specialize in export promotion and project management will be&#13;
redeployed to carry out new responsibilities in line with the project objectives. Such staff will constitute&#13;
the project management team. Project staff will also be complemented with three crop specialists to be&#13;
recruited through local competition to provide technical and market development advice to individual&#13;
producers/exporters and their associations. The overall supervision of project implementation will be&#13;
entrusted to the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources.&#13;
4.02          Under the project, the project manager's contract will be made for a period of two years&#13;
renewable annually depending on demonstrated performance. The above local professionals will also be&#13;
recruited on two year contracts renewable annually upon satisfactory performance too. The professional&#13;
organizations participating in the project will contribute from membership fees to share in the operating&#13;
costs, as of project year 3 and onward. The project manager's and the local professionals' responsibilities&#13;
are summarized in Annex 10.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
4.03          The project management team will be assisted by a team of intemationally recruited&#13;
technical assistants including an export development and sales specialist with financial/export finance&#13;
experience, and a farmer organization specialist who will be paired with the above local professionals.&#13;
Such technical assistants will further provide assistance in: (a) promoting the establishment of professional&#13;
organizations and of their interprofessional group; (b) preparing the training programs and organizing&#13;
training sessions; (c) designing the data base management; (d) setting up appropriate accounting and&#13;
financial management systems for the agricultural professional associations and the future interprofessional&#13;
group; (e) providing guidance and advice to local professional staff with the objective of helping develop a&#13;
local expertise that could overtime become the foundation of a specialized private service for export market&#13;
development; and (f) and more generally provide the required training to transfer their knowledge, know-&#13;
how and responsibilities to the local professional staff. The technical assistants will be accountable to this&#13;
respect and their performance will be evaluated on, among other things, the extent to which such transfer&#13;
actually takes place. Ad hoc technical assistant assignments in export logistics and air freight advisory will&#13;
be carried out too. The terms of reference of the above technical assistants are presented in Annexes 2 and&#13;
3. The above technical assistants' contracts will be financed through bilateral donors' grants for a period of&#13;
two years which may be eventually extended for a duration not to exceed twelve months upon satisfactory&#13;
performance. Appointment of project management team with key personnel to be satisfactory to IDA at all&#13;
times during project implementation would be a condition of Credit effectiveness. To ensure that the&#13;
provisions of the Project Implementation Manual and Operational Plan are observed by the project&#13;
management, the draft document was discussed at negotiations and found acceptable. The adoption of a&#13;
final document acceptable to IDA would be a condition of Credit effectiveness.&#13;
B. Reporting Arrangements&#13;
4.04          Annual Work Programs (AWPs). The Project Management would establish an annual&#13;
work program for each project year, for IDA's review and approval. The objectives of the programs would&#13;
be (a) to facilitate comprehensive review of project implementation progress, (b) to make possible&#13;
adjustments and/or modifications as experience is gained, and (c) to serve as a planning and monitoring&#13;
system. The draft AWP would be prepared and submitted to IDA by the Project Management every year&#13;
by September 30 for the following year and by September 30, 1995 for the first year. The program would&#13;
include: (a) a budget for project activities with the details for each component including the training&#13;
component; (b) monitorable targets for project activities; (c) commitments and expected disbursements&#13;
under the IDA credit; and (d) a discussion of any major issues and problems affecting the project&#13;
implementation and proposed follow-up actions.&#13;
4.05          Quarterly Progress Reports (OPRs) and Annual Progress Reports ( APRs). These would&#13;
be prepared by the Project Management. Copies of QPRs would be submitted to IDA no later than one&#13;
month after the end of each quarter. APRs would be made available to IDA no later than March 31 of the&#13;
following year. APRs would incorporate information on and comparison of achievements against targets&#13;
set out in AWPs to enable a meaningful review of the project performance to be made by all interested&#13;
parties.&#13;
4.06          Mid-Term Review and Implementation Completion Report (ICR). To facilitate a timely&#13;
and meaningful dialogue between the Government and IDA, and help effect mid-course corrections that&#13;
might be required, the Government would, not later than June 30, 1998, carry out jointly with IDA a&#13;
comprehensive mid-term review of the project. The review would cover: (a) overall project performance&#13;
and agreed key performance indicators; (b) evaluation of project success and problems to draw lessons to&#13;
be taken into account in the future expansion of project activities; (c) assessment of the project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
sustainability; and (d) evaluation of consultants' and technical assistants' performance. The key mid-term&#13;
review indicators are presented in Annex 5. Promptly after completing the mid-term review, the&#13;
Government would carry out the recommendations arising out of the review as agreed between the&#13;
Government and IDA. The Government would also prepare and submit to IDA an Implementation&#13;
Completion Report (ICR) not later than six months after the end of the project. Appropriate assurances&#13;
were obtained at Negotiations.&#13;
4 07          Monitoring and Evaluation. Project monitoring would be carried out through field visits as&#13;
well as written reports. Monitoring field visits would be undertaken as frequently as feasible by the project&#13;
management and IDA in the course of project implementation. Written reports would commence with the&#13;
preparation of Annual Work Programs (AWPs) and annual project budget prepared well ahead of the&#13;
commencement of each project year. The project MIS reports would therefore be designed in such a&#13;
manlier as to make them suitable to serve as a management tool and for submission to IDA. The QPRs and&#13;
APRs would similarly be action-oriented, drawing attention to exceptions and issues requiring corrective&#13;
action.&#13;
4.08          General oversight and monitoring of project activities will be carried out through a&#13;
Steering Committee to be in charge of reviewing and approving once a year the project's budget and annual&#13;
work program including all major contracts. Appropriate assurances were obtained during Negotiations&#13;
that the Steering Committee composed of five members will comprise representatives of technical ministries&#13;
including the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources and the Ministry of Finance and that of the&#13;
private sector and be maintained with functions and responsibilities acceptable to IDA throughout the&#13;
execution of the Project. Existing and future professional associations will also be involved in project&#13;
execution through thematic technical committees regrouping their representatives to review and follow up&#13;
the project actions and priorities and advise the selection of beneficiaries of project support programs&#13;
including promotion of professional organizations and export diversification actions. The establishment of&#13;
the Steering Committee would be a condition of Credit effectiveness.&#13;
4.09          The project impact would be evaluated, by reference to the objectives set out for the&#13;
project, during and after the project period. This may be done by qualified and experienced university staff&#13;
locally. The project management would further arrange to continually assess changes in the project&#13;
monitoring indicators. Assurances were obtained on the above reporting arrangements at Negotiations.&#13;
V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATIONS&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
5.01          The project will directly benefit over an estimated 100 private enterprises/exporters and&#13;
reach indirectly by project completion at least 10,000 growers of non traditional crops who, without this&#13;
project, would have little or no hope to develop successful export sales on their own. It will have major&#13;
impact on agricultural professional organizations as it will contribute to streamlining existing associations&#13;
and helping establish new ones and will thereby empower these organizations to effectively lobby&#13;
Government for necessary changes related to their activities while enhancing the ability of these&#13;
organizations to represent producers/exporters. The project will also foster improved links between&#13;
production and markets, and result in increased exports of agricultural products. The development of non&#13;
traditional crop exports will create many new jobs throughout the country for those producers/exporters&#13;
engaged in such activities. It will also bring new technology and training to farmers and other professionals&#13;
in the trade. It will further move the country from a position of being highly dependent on traditional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
commodity crops, such as cocoa, coffee, cotton, etc. to a position of producing high value, branded Ivorian&#13;
products which sell at high prices in the off-season in cold countries of Europe and other continents. This&#13;
is expected to bring about a significant improvement in the country's balance of payments position. The&#13;
project will also result in substantial local value-added because of increased local demand for processed&#13;
products which would be an additional outlet for non exportable products. In addition to the above&#13;
benefits, the project will enhance the skills and knowledge of farmers and exporters significantly and carry&#13;
many farmers from subsistence level farming to a position of profitable producers of high value export&#13;
crops.&#13;
5.02          The economic rate of return calculated on the incremental exported agricultural production&#13;
for nine major non traditional crop channels comprising grated coconut, cashew nuts, essential oils, tropical&#13;
flowers, fruits and vegetables was estimated at 17 percent. The concemed crops are high value-added&#13;
agricultural products which fetch fairly high selling prices on international markets. The robustness of the&#13;
above rate is further explained by the impact of the unprecedented 50 percent devaluation of the local&#13;
currency which is having a favorable impact on net margins and the relative share of local production&#13;
factors costs such as that of labor. Detailed assumptions and computation of the rate of return are&#13;
presented in Annex 7.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
5.03          The major foreseeable risk is likely to be a slower than expected private sector supply&#13;
response if conflicting interests were to delay the hoped-for improvements in the incentive framework for&#13;
agricultural exports. If the implementation of the Government's plan to progressively liberalize sea and air&#13;
freights were delayed and tariffs were not adjusted, there might also be a risk that freight costs could price&#13;
Ivorian products out of the international market. Such risks would be reduced, however, through the&#13;
removal of major economic and sectoral constraints as part of the reforms agreed upon under the&#13;
Economic Recovery Credit (ERC) which became effective in November 1994, and those to be supported&#13;
through the future Agricultural Structural Adjustment Credit (ASAC), in addition to increased involvement&#13;
in lobbying actions by the recently created Air Freight Committee. There is also a risk that government&#13;
agencies attempt to interfere with project activities. The strengthening of professional organizations and&#13;
eventually their grouping into an interprofessional group of trade associations would empower them to&#13;
better represent and defend their interests, remain self-reliant and ensure an effective project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
C. Environmental Impact&#13;
5.04          The environmental analysis of the project concluded that it entails no significant negative&#13;
environmental impacts. The industries in the sector are not polluting, the expected increases in cultivated&#13;
areas will take place on cleared land, with no impact on natural forests. The main environmental issue&#13;
associated with the project is the expected increase in the utilization of agricultural chemicals and&#13;
pesticides, in order to meet the quality standards required for exports. A closer analysis of the latter issue&#13;
showed that CMte d'lvoire is well advanced in terms of the control of pesticide distribution, thus reducing&#13;
the likelihood of negative environmental impacts.  In certain cases, the project will have positive&#13;
environmental impacts by creating incentives for planting tree crops and maintaining the existing vegetation&#13;
that yields valuable gathered products (i.e., shea nut and kola). In addition, the project may create&#13;
incentives for the stabilization of agriculture by promoting environmentally sound cash crops and by&#13;
increasing household income in rural areas through the marketing of high value specialized agricultural&#13;

COTE D'IVOIRE&#13;
PROJET DE PROMOTION ET DIVERSIFICATION DES EXPORTATIONS&#13;
AGRICOLES&#13;
1. Criteres de selection des beneficiaires du projet.&#13;
Le projet vise la promotion de cultures de diversification a haute valeur ajoutee destin6es&#13;
principalement A l'exportation. Les beneficiaires en seront les entreprises personnelles&#13;
ivoiriennes et societes privees de droit ivoirien ainsi que les associations de&#13;
producteurs/exportateurs et autres organisations professionnelles du secteur agricole&#13;
d'exportation.&#13;
Les types d'activites eligibles comprendront:&#13;
(a)   la promotion commerciale et recherche de marches;&#13;
(b)   les etudes de faisabilite;&#13;
(c)   les actions de recherche pour la promotion, le contr6le de qualite, la&#13;
transformation et la conservation des produits;&#13;
(d)   les tests d'expedition;&#13;
(e)   les services d'appui technique pour la recherche de  financement, le conseil en&#13;
comptabilite/gestion et etude juridique, la formation.&#13;
a) Criteres techniques.&#13;
Les beneficiaires du projet doivent avant tout etre des producteurs ayant demontre leur&#13;
savoir-faire et ma7trisant les donnees techniques de la production consideree (production&#13;
et conditionnement). Ils doivent donc avoir deja acquis une experience, et etre capables de&#13;
demontrer, chiffres .A l'appui, leur capacite a offrir des produits de qualite marchande&#13;
export. Cette condition est primordiale d'autant que le PPDEA n'est pas un projet de&#13;
recherche agronomique et n'entend pas initier des productions pour lesquelles des facteurs&#13;
techniques ne sont pas encore bien ma1tris6s. Certes, un appui technique peut toujours etre&#13;
offert, mais pour des producteurs deja bien avertis. Le projet doit donc evaluer la capacite&#13;
technique de ses beneficiaires d'une facon realiste et surtout s'abstenir de les encourager a&#13;
prendre des risques inconsideres. I1 doit veiller A ce que les conditions d'exploitation&#13;
optima soient bien reunies sur le site de production: qualite des terres, disponibilite de&#13;
l'eau, climat favorable, etc. Des conditions de production marginales ne seront donc pas&#13;
acceptables.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
b) Criteres commerciaux.&#13;
Le projet entend promouvoir des productions pour lesquelles un marche existe. II convient&#13;
donc de proceder a une etude de marche prealable pour s'en assurer et identifier les&#13;
circuits commerciaux possibles et existants. En principe, le promoteur doit deja avoir une&#13;
certaine experience dans ce domaine, mais le projet peut l'appuyer pour obtenir de&#13;
meilleures conditions et mieux ma7itriser les techniques d'exportation (conditionnement,&#13;
formalites administratives et financieres, detaxes a l'exportation, etc.)&#13;
c) Criteres personnels.&#13;
Le promoteur doit consacrer l'essentiel des ses activites a la bonne marche de son projet. II&#13;
doit en principe resider sur son exploitation ou a proximite, la diriger et la surveiller&#13;
personnellement. S'il s'agit d'une societ6 (ou groupement, ou cooperative), il faudra bien&#13;
connaTtre la personne responsable de l'exploitation (proprietaire ou gerant) pour s'assurer&#13;
de ses competences techniques et de gestionnaire. L'experience, les resultats deja acquis&#13;
sont des facteurs plus importants que la formation universitaire.&#13;
d) Criteres financiers et montants limites d'intervention du PPDEA.&#13;
I1 est essentiel que les performances anterieures soient bien connues, que les grands&#13;
6quilibres du bilan soient maintenus et que la rentabilite du projet soit assuree.&#13;
Chaque beneficiaire du PPDEA sera tenu de faire un apport personnel dont la quotite&#13;
moyenne sera:&#13;
(a)    pour les actions de promotion et recherche de marche: 40%; soit une contribution&#13;
annuelle d'environ de 30% les deux premieres annees, de 40% sur les deux ann6es&#13;
suivantes, et de 50% la derniere annee.&#13;
(b)    pour l'appui a la recherche: 20%; soit une contribution annuelle d'environ 10% du&#13;
demarrage du projet a la fin de la seconde annee, puis de 20% la troisieme annee,&#13;
30% la quatrieme annee et 40% la derniere annee.&#13;
(c)    pour les services de conseil financier: 30%; soit une contribution annuelle&#13;
d'environ 40% du demarrage du projet a la fin de la seconde annee, puis de 40%&#13;
sur deux ans a partir de 1998, et de 50% a la derniere annee du projet.&#13;
Par ailleurs, des montants limites d'intervention seront de rigueur afin de toucher un&#13;
nombre optimal de beneficiaires. Ainsi, les plafonds ci-dessous seront de rigueur en&#13;
fonction du statut juridique des beneficiares:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
(a)    pour les entreprises personnelles, la totalite des appuis sollicites aupres du PPDEA&#13;
ne pourra exceder un plafond de $25.000 pour un meme beneficiaire pendant la dur6e&#13;
d'execution du PPDEA;&#13;
(b)   les societes privees pourront beneficier d'une limite d'intervention du PPDEA&#13;
n'excedant pas $50.000 par beneficiaire;&#13;
(c)    pour les organisations professionnelles agricoles, la limite ci-dessus ne pourrait&#13;
exceder $100.000.&#13;
2. Modalites d'appui pour le financement des projets&#13;
Un des objectifs principaux du projet est de foumir une assistance technique a un ensemble&#13;
de    promoteurs    (directement    ou    par    l'intermediaire    de    leurs&#13;
associations/unions/organisations professionnelles) cherchant a developper leur production&#13;
pour satisfaire une demande exterieure. Dans ce cadre, Le PPDEA pourra aider le&#13;
promoteur a rechercher les financements complementaires necessaires pour le&#13;
d6veloppement de son exploitation.&#13;
Le PPDEA aidera le promoteur a presenter une etude de factibilite de son projet de&#13;
developpement. A cette occasion, seront revues tous les aspects techniques, commerciaux,&#13;
economiques et de gestion du projet. Ces etudes de factibilit6, avec les comptes detailles&#13;
de l'exploitation existante, doivent servir a l'evaluation du projet par une institution&#13;
financiere.&#13;
Le PPDEA ne sera pas dote d'une ligne de credit speciale. En effet, il existe deja des lignes&#13;
de credit disponibles pour des promoteurs du secteur prive mises en place par des&#13;
organisations financieres bilaterale ou intemationales. Ces lignes sont pour le moment sous&#13;
utilis6es en raison de la difficulte a identifier des projets et des promoteurs. Les banques&#13;
commerciales peuvent aussi offrir des financements d'appoint pour la majorite des&#13;
promoteurs prospectes a ce jour par le PPDEA. Enfin, le Gouvernement a mis en place le&#13;
fonds de diversification cite ci-dessus dote de 1,25 milliard de FCFA. La contrainte au&#13;
d6veloppement de ces projets n'est pas le manque de financement, mais la capacite des&#13;
promoteurs A les mobiliser.&#13;
3. Modalites d'appui en matiere de conseil en gestion&#13;
D'une facon generale, le PPDEA devrait pouvoir disposer d'un kit de procedures&#13;
comptables et de gestion a suivre pour le mettre a la disposition des projets qu'il&#13;
encourage. Ce kit pourrait egalement comprendre les indicateurs de gestion techniques et&#13;
financiers A suivre d'une facon reguliere.&#13;
De meme, le PPDEA devrait disposer de competences en matiere juridique et fiscale. II&#13;
pourrait en effet avoir a conseiller les promoteurs dans des domaines varies allant de la&#13;
creation d'entreprises (choix des types de societe, statuts), modalites de financement a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 4&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
1'exportation ( techniques bancaires, credits documentaire, role des transitaires), et options&#13;
fiscales (TVA, detaxe a 1'exportation, avantages du code des investissements).&#13;
Les demandes en ces domaines peuvent etre tres variables d'un projet a un autre et il serait&#13;
trop onereux pour le PPDEA de recruter un ou plusieurs experts. Par consequent, le&#13;
PPDEA fera appel i un cabinet de la place specialise, sous une forme d'abonnement, pour&#13;
repondre aux besoin du projet a la demande des promoteurs. Eventuellement, le PPDEA&#13;
pourrait demander i ce cabinet des prestations en matiere de formation donnee a un&#13;
ensemble de promoteurs sur des sujets specifiques.&#13;

Republic of CMte d'Ivoire&#13;
Agricultural Export Promotion and Diversification Project&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
Assumptions&#13;
1.01          The computation of the Internal Economic Rate of Return (IRR) is based on the determination of&#13;
the incremental agricultural product export by producers / exporters supported under the project through estimating&#13;
the without- and with-project situations. A conservative approach was adopted in view of the projected exports&#13;
representing the lowest levels of export the project can achieve during its lifetime. Agricultural export products are&#13;
valued at F.O.B. prices used in computing the net export margins. No further adjustment of the exchange rate was&#13;
effected in view of the unprecedented 50% devaluation of the CFA franc (from CFAF50 to lFrench Franc to&#13;
CFAF100 to 1 French Franc) on January 12, 1994. Thus the foreign exchange premium is assumed to be equal to&#13;
zero. Interest payments, amortization and taxes were removed from the financial costs to make up the economic&#13;
costs.&#13;
1.02          The opportunity cost of capital of 12% was used in the calculations. On the basis of what&#13;
precedes, the IRR of the production component is estimated at 17 % for 15 years net benefit streams, and the NPV&#13;
is approximately $5.7 million. Such a rate appears robust particularly in view of the results of the sensitivity&#13;
analysis which further shows that if the investment costs increase by 10%, the net benefits will decrease by 14%&#13;
and the IRR falls to 13%; as the investment costs further increase by 20%, the benefits decrease by 28% and the&#13;
IRR falls to 10% which is close to the preceding 13%. The IRR falls to zero only in the unlikely situtation when&#13;
the investment costs increase by 69%. In contrast, if investment costs decrease by 10%, net benefits will increase by&#13;
14% and the IRR will increase to 21%. On the other hand, if the net incremental benefits decrease by 10%/o, the IRR&#13;
falls to 12%, and decreases to 8% as the net benefits diminish by 20%. At a 41% decrease of net incremental&#13;
benefits the IRR reaches zero and becomes negative at 44% decrease of benefits. Detailed projections by crop of the&#13;
overall project cash flows are presented below.&#13;

ANALYSIS OF FREIGHT IMPACT&#13;
The following calculations are intented to present an assessment of the freight impact on the&#13;
profitability of Ivorian agricultural products. The results indicate that, despite relatively high&#13;
transportation costs, Ivorian products are not likely to be priced out of the international market,&#13;
especially for tropical fruits, flowers, bananas and pineapple. They also demonstrate that&#13;
profitability of Ivorian products may be improved through lower freight tariffs policy as in&#13;
competing countries like Cameroon, Kenya and South Africa.&#13;
The following results are based on a piece of analysis using a mathematical programming&#13;
approach. The analysis consisted of designing transportation linear programming models so as to&#13;
produce the optimal combination of agricultural products traffics which minimizes transportation&#13;
cost on the overall market. In other words, this allows to measure exporting countries&#13;
competitiveness with respect to freight tariffs.&#13;
Data Collection. The export sector is an area where information is very costly to share with&#13;
outsiders. This explains why, in absence of a formal study by professionals, it has not been easy to&#13;
get precise information on maritime freight. However, It was possible to get information on the&#13;
average maritime freight tariffs for banana and pineapple exported from Costa-Rica to Europe.&#13;
Air freight data were drawn from the study by Airport Planning Associates (APA), Inc., which&#13;
dealt with tropical fruits and flowers only. They were presented for eight exporting countries&#13;
including Cote d'Ivoire and six importing countries comprising both European and North&#13;
American countries which are the most representative of the market.&#13;
Method and Procedure. The analysis is based on the linear programming method - i.e., an iterative&#13;
process with an exhaustive computation of objective function values and the selection of the value&#13;
that satisfies the objective function. The level of products import from producing countries that&#13;
derives the lowest transportation cost is the optimal level, say, the cost-efficient level of&#13;
agricultural products exchange.&#13;
The objective function is the minimization of cost associated with products traffic all over the&#13;
market. Given promoters' reluctance in information sharing, it was uneasy to know precisely the&#13;
exact quantities flows of agricultural products. Nevertheless, it was possible to base the analysis&#13;
on importing countries' cost-efficient choice in placing an order for one unit (metric ton) of a&#13;
given product, provided all producing countries' geographic location and freight arrangements.&#13;
The constraint in this model is that importing countries demands have to be met.&#13;
Results. The linear programming results are as follows:&#13;

The optimal distribution of tropical fruits table shows that if each importing country were to place an order&#13;
for one metric ton of tropical fruits from the presented producing countries, they would make their&#13;
decisions cost-efficiently. For instance, a potential fruits client from New-York would order from Costa-&#13;
Rica in the first place. However, if for some reason he could not, his second best alternative would be to&#13;
order from Cameroon. He would rank his decision alternatives in light of the associated shadow prices.&#13;
Shadow prices reflect the increase in transportation cost when electing to exchange one unit of agricultural&#13;
product. Shadow prices associated with the optimal levels of products exchange are zero, for they match&#13;
the minimum-cost values of the iteration. This explains how the above table was designed. The lower the&#13;
shadow price, the more cost-efficient the decision is. Exporting countries were ranked by destination in that&#13;
pattern in the above optimal import distribution table.&#13;

To this respect, Costa-Rica and Cameroon happen to be the most competitive producing countries on the&#13;
tropical fruits export market for New-York and other destinations, respectively. By extending the analysis,&#13;
one could draw a mean rank over all destinations and end up concluding that CMe d'Ivoire is the third most&#13;
competitive tropical fruits exporting country among seven potential competitors. Which means that despite&#13;
relatively high freight costs for Ivorian agricultural products, C8te d'Ivoire over-ranks a significant number&#13;
of exporting countries, due to its geographical location (the country is about 5,000 kilometers away from&#13;
most of European importing countries). Thus, if with the support of the Government, Air-Afrique could set&#13;
its air-freight tariffs below their current monopolistic levels, members countries including CMte d'Ivoire&#13;
would gain a lot from agricultural export and become more competitive on European destinations.&#13;
Results for tropical flowers market were also obtained from the optimization analysis. They show the same&#13;
pattern as those of the tropical fruits export market, and can be presented as follows:&#13;

According to the above results, Cote d'Ivoire is less competitive within the tropical flowers market than it is in the&#13;
fruits market, as it ranks at the average fifth over all destinations. Which means that although the Ivorian flowers do not price&#13;
out of the export market, high freight costs prevent it from taking advantage of being closer to European destinations than other&#13;
exporting countries like South Africa and Kenya. The latter enjoy comfortable positions of competitiveness due to relatively&#13;
low freight costs (about half of freight costs for products departing from C6te d'Ivoire). This explains why it is critical that&#13;
freight tariffs be reduced in order to improve the country' s competitiveness.&#13;
Products traffic by sea was also an area of investigation in this analysis, but due to poor data, it was not necessary to&#13;
run a GAMS program for a model comprising one destination (Europe) and two origins (C6te d'Ivoire and Costa-Rica), for the&#13;
banana and pineapple market. From the transportation costs data related to the two origins, it appeared that Cote d'Ivoire was&#13;
more competitive for the European destination than Costa-Rica. However, such a conclusion could be misleading, because the&#13;
whole market needs to be pictured in order to get a better appreciation of the decision making process. In other words the area&#13;
of maritime transportation should be further researched to get sufficient data allowing to measure exporting countries'&#13;
competiveness, as it has been done for products traffic by air.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Agricultural
            Export Promotion and Diversification Project will be to
            diversify and expand private agricultural exports with a
            view to supporting the Government's export-led growth
            strategy, through: 1) export market development activities
            for non traditional agricultural products allowing for
            diversification out of traditional export crops; this will
            be achieved by scaling up actions initiated under an
            eighteen month old pilot operation as part of project
            preparation; 2) support to producers' and
            exporters' organizations; and 3) upgrading of export
            facilities. The diversification of agricultural exports is
            futher intended to reduce the country's excessive
            dependence on traditional crops such as cocoa, coffee and
            timber. The project will have the following components: a)
            export promotion and diversification actions through
            assisting authorities in: i) market research, customer
            identification, meeting quality requirements; ii) product
            development and quality control; iii) establishment of
            business partnerships; b) support to
            producers/exporters' organizations; and c) upgrading
            export handling facilities; and d) project management support.
