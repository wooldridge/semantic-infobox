The International Finance Corporation (IFC), a multilateral institution, was established in 1956 with&#13;
a mandate to foster economic growth by promoting private sector investment in its developing mein-&#13;
ber countries. TFC is a member of the World Bank Group, which also indudes the International Bank&#13;
for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Development Association (IDA), and&#13;
the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). Although IFC's activities are closely coordi-&#13;
natcd with, and complement, the overall development objectives of the other World Bank Group&#13;
institutions, IFC is legally and financially independent, with its own Articles of Agreement, share-&#13;
holders, financial structure, management, and staff.&#13;
IFC combines the characteristics of a multilateral development bank and a private merchant bank. Its&#13;
share capital is provided by its 147 developed and developing member countries, which collectively&#13;
determine its policies and activities. IFC's profitability, strong shareholder support, and substantial&#13;
paid-in capital base have allowed it to raise most of the funds for its lending activities through its&#13;
triple-A rated bond issues in the international financial markets. Equity investments are financed&#13;
from the capital base and retained earnings.&#13;
In its project financing role IFC provides loans and makes equity investments. Unlike most multilate-&#13;
ral institutions, IFC does not require government guarantees for its financing. Like a private financial&#13;
institution, the Corporation prices its finance and services in line with the market and seeks profitable&#13;
returns. IFC shares full project risks with its partners.&#13;
IFC's experience in doing business in developing countries as well as its risk-management skills and&#13;
thorough project appraisals all contribute to the success of the private sector projects it supports.&#13;
These qualities also enable IFC to play an important catalytic role in mobilizing additional project&#13;
fiuding from other investors and lenders, either in the form of cofinancing or through loan syndica-&#13;
tions, the underwriting of debt and securities issues, and guarantees. In addition to project finance&#13;
and resource mobilization, IFC offers a full array of advisory services and technical assistance, helping&#13;
private businesses in the developing world to increase their chances of success and advising govern-&#13;
ments on creating an environmenit that encourages private investment.&#13;
In its 36 years of operation, IFC has provided nearly $11 billion in financing for more than 1,000&#13;
companies in 98 developing countries. Today IFC is the largest source of direct financing for private&#13;
sector projects in developing countries. IFC has a vital role to play in helping developing countries to&#13;
make the transition to open, market-oriented economies and to build strong private sectors. As more&#13;
and more developing countries adopt market-based policies, demand for IFC's services-loans,&#13;
equity investments, resource mobilization, and advice-continues to grow.&#13;

throughout the developing world persevered with       in financing for its own account for 167 projects,&#13;
free-market reforms. Albania, Bulgaria, Equatorial     compared with $1.5 billion for 152 projects in fiscal&#13;
Guinea, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, and      1991. Equity and quasi-equity investments, which&#13;
Switzerland joined the Corporation during the year,    represented 21 percent of total financing approved&#13;
and Comoros joined shortly after the close of the      for IFC's own account, were increased in accordance&#13;
fiscal year, bringing IFC's membership to 147 coun-    with the Corporation's goal of helping companies&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Even a weak recovery, however, is likely to stimulate&#13;
growth in developing countries. And, although real&#13;
commodity prices are likely to remain relatively low&#13;
for some years, they are expected to increase slightly,&#13;
In addition, debt-service ratios have been declining&#13;
in highly indebted middle-income countries, as&#13;
interest rates fall in the United States and Japan.&#13;
These factors, along with successful stabilization&#13;
and reform programs in several developing coun-&#13;
tries, should result in slightly higher rates of growvth&#13;
in 1992. The overall rate of growth in developing&#13;
countries (excluding Eastern Europe) is expected&#13;
to increase from 3.4 percent in real terms in 1991,&#13;
to 4.3 percent in 1992, with somewhat faster growth&#13;
in the years beyond.&#13;
East Asia, where growth rates are expected to remain&#13;
high, offers encouraging investment prospects.&#13;
Economic recovery in Latin America, after the&#13;
so-called "lost decade" of the 1980s, should con-&#13;
tinue, as a number of countries pursue market-&#13;
oriented policies. Growth should increase in the&#13;
Middle East and North Africa because of reconstruc-&#13;
tion efforts and, more important, because of market&#13;
reforms in several countries. Future growth in South&#13;
Asia remains a question, although there has been&#13;
significant and encouraging liberalization in India&#13;
and Pakistan. Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
have also begun economic reform programs but, on&#13;
the whole, prospects for that region remain difficult.&#13;
Certainly the growth prospects of developing coun-&#13;
tries will improve if barriers to trade are reduced.&#13;
Positive resolutionl of the remaining problems in&#13;
the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations is vitally&#13;
important to the expansion of exports from develop-&#13;
ing countries, particularly manufactured exports.&#13;
If agreement can be reached on several non-tariff&#13;
barriers to trade (for example, the Multifiber&#13;
Arrangemeint, agricultural subsidies and quotas,&#13;
antidumping regulations, "voluntary" export&#13;
restraints), the climate could be improved for sub-&#13;
stantially increasing exports from developing coun-&#13;
tries to the industrial countries.&#13;

one of IFC's top priorities for the 1990s.&#13;
An essential element in a successful privatization&#13;
program is strong public support. Information&#13;
campaigns to increase public understanding of the&#13;
process and its objectives are important. In this&#13;
regard, the decisionmaking process must be shown&#13;
to be transparent and fair.&#13;
Finally, governments need to be prepared to over-&#13;
come bureaucratic and political resistance to privati-&#13;
zation. Action requires strong and sustained political&#13;
will, Privatization has succeeded where policy deci-&#13;

motivated, and competent government team held&#13;
accountable for speed and transparency.&#13;
A host of practical problems arise in the sale proccss.&#13;
Among other things, there is a need to reconcile the&#13;
interests of directly affected groups, sort out legal&#13;
problems, and work out bidding procedures. Some&#13;
of these problems cannot he seen clearly until the&#13;
process is well under way. For this reason, it can be&#13;
useful to conduct a privatization program in stages,&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
PRIVATIZATION OF A LARGE INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISE: SKODA PILSEN&#13;
Skoda Pilsen, one of Czechoslovakia's largest industrial enterprises, is being restructured and privatized as part of&#13;
the Government of Czechoslovakia's program of economic reform. The company is located in and around the city of&#13;
Pilsen. Tt has nearly 40,000 employees and annual sales of roughly $2 billion, calculated at international prices. Its&#13;
18 operating divisions mnani ufacture everythingfrom castings andforgings to trolleys and loco motives, fromn machine&#13;
tools and steel rolling mills to turbines and nuclear reactors. Over the past year, lEC has provided assistance with the&#13;
restructuring of some of Skoda's operations-in particular, it advised Skoda on the establishment of two joint ventures&#13;
with foreign partners.&#13;
Skoda is a microcosmti of the probleems, issues, and opportunities confronting the economies of Eastern Europe.&#13;
Like many other industrial enterprises, it is operating in an environment undergoing a radical transformation, as&#13;
Czechoslovakia movesfrom a command to afree-mnarket economy. Stripped of its traditional markets, Skoda is being&#13;
forced to confront its ownl inefficiencies in produiction, management, and marketing.&#13;
IFC's work consisted of two phases. Duiring the first phase, IrC sent a 21 -person team-financial analysts, engineers,&#13;
industry specialists, and consultants to Pilsen to conduct a strategic review of the company, division by division,&#13;
identifying Skoda's strengths and weaknesses and making recommendations to Skoda's management. The teamn found&#13;
that Skoda's strengths and weaknesses were typical of comnpanies throughout Eastern Europe. In itsfavor, Skoda had&#13;
a strong industrial tradition, excellent engineerinlg and technical skills, low labor costs, existing engineering and&#13;
manufacturing capacity, and access to East European markets. However, it also had a number of problems that need-&#13;
ed to be addressed. Skoda had traditionally operated as a production unit rather than a business enterprise and had&#13;
little experience with international competition. Its equipment andproduction operations needed to be changed, and&#13;
new business and marketing methods were required.&#13;
The second phase of lFC's advisory work involved the establishment of two new joinit ventures, onefor the power&#13;
generation operations of Skoda Pilsen and its affiliate, Skoda Praha, and the other for Skoda's locomotive manufac-&#13;
turing operations. IFC helped Skoda solicit interestfrom a wide range of international investor groups, all of which&#13;
were considered to have the capacity to assist in solving the company's management, mnarketing. andfinancinig&#13;
problems. After selection of a short-list, negotiations were conducted, which led to a sale agreement. The agreement&#13;

PRIVATIZAI'ION OF SMALL-SCALE ENTERPRISES IN NIZHNY NOVGOF.OD&#13;
IFC played the leading role in helping Russia launch its first privatization program. It designed and implemented&#13;
the country's first mass privatization of small-scale enterprises, in the city of Nizhny Novgorod (formerlyv Gorky), the&#13;
capital of the Nizhny Novgorod region. This city, which has apopulation of 1.45 million, wasfounded in 1221, at the&#13;
confluence of the Volga and Oka rivers in the heart of European Russia. It was Russia's main trade and commercial&#13;
center before the 1917 Revolution. Until September 1991 it was a closed city with restricted access to outsiders.&#13;
The Nizhny Novgorod mass privatization involves the auctioning of 2,000 retail shops, food stores, and communal&#13;
facilities owned by the city. Its design was based on the requirements of Russia's privatization law ana regulations, the&#13;
city'sparticular needs, and the experiences of IFC and others involved in privatizationt in Poland and Czechoslovakia.&#13;
To expedite the process, IFC, working under the World Bank Technical Assistance Program, assemb.ed an interna-&#13;
tional team of experts. Staff and consultants were brought to Nizhny Novgorodfrom Poland, auctioneers and imple-&#13;
menters of small-scale privalization from Czechoslovakia, and lawyersfrom Sweden and the United States. Russian&#13;
officials went to Czechoslovakia to watch the auctioning of municipal property in Prague.&#13;
The auctions began in March. In designing the program, IFC emphasized speed, efficiency, and trarsparency. All&#13;
Russian citizens were allowed to participate, and incentivies were offered to shop employees. Transfer of control was&#13;
almost irmmediate-the new owners took over twa days after the auction. Auctions are now held weekly and are&#13;
attended by hundreds of local citizens, as well as officials from other regions and cities. Despite initiail misgivings by&#13;
members of the workers' collectives about the program, many of the premises sold have been bought by the collectives.&#13;
Incentives offered to the collectives include a 3opercentdiscount on the saleprice and a one-year installmentpayment&#13;
program. About 75 percent of the enterprises'former employees have been re-hired by ithe new owners; part of the&#13;
auction proceeds go to a fund to help workers affected by the privatizations.&#13;
The Nizhny Novgorod privatization model is being adopted bv cities throughout Russia. IFC has been asked to&#13;
prepare a manual for the Ministry of Privatization on how to privatize small-scale municipal enterprises, based&#13;
on the Nizhny Novgorod experience.&#13;
PRIVATIZATION OF AlTOS HORNOS ZAPLA IN ARGENTINA&#13;
IFC was the adviser to theArgentineMinistryofDefense in theprivatization ofthesteel companyAltos Hornos Zapla&#13;
(AHZ), thefirst successfillprivatization of the Fabricaciones Militares Defense Ministry holdings in Argentina. AHZ&#13;
is a steel mill located itn Palpala, Province of Jujuy, approximately 1,000 miles northwest of Buenos Aires. The steel&#13;
mill, which is capable of producing specialty and high-quality steels, was experiencing significant losses at the time&#13;
the privati2ation process started, and suffering from low productivity and substantial operational inefficiencies.&#13;
IFC designed and implemetnted a privatization strategyforAIIZ that wouldfulfill the Government's objectives of&#13;
removing a loss-makingfirm from the budget and ensuring that the mill continued to operate. Moreover, the priva-&#13;
tization had to be implemented in a relatively short time. IFCpromoted the mill to interested parties in Asia, Europe,&#13;
and South America with experience in steel manufacture.&#13;
Theformulafor evaluating the bids gave weight not only to theprice offered, but also to the number ofjemployees that&#13;
would be retained and the amount of investment the buyer was prepared to make. On March 31, 1992, the Ministry&#13;
of Defense awarded AHZ to a consortium including an Argentine engineeringfirm and a French specialty-steel-&#13;
maker; the mill was transferred to its new owners on July 1, 1992. IFC is the privatization adviserfor ECA, another&#13;
company owned by the Ministry of Defense. The valuation of ECA has been completed, and the privatization strategy&#13;
is beingfinalized.&#13;

In the past five years, demand for IFC's advisory      and the CIS.&#13;
services has grown, particLdarly in connection with&#13;
privatizations and corporate restructurings. During    The Corporation's Technical Advisory Service,&#13;
fiscal 1992 the Corporation received 30 advisory       established in fiscal 1991, provided advice on&#13;
mandates, over one-third of which related to privati-  projects in the agro-industry; cement, petro-&#13;

another 10 potential assignments.                      sectors to businesses and governments in Europe&#13;
and Latin America.&#13;

Latin America and Eastern Europe, where the&#13;
Corporation advises both governments and enter-&#13;
prises in its member countries on privatizations           LOAN AND INVESTMENT APPROVALS,&#13;

and corporate restructur-ings. During fiscal 1992                       (millions of U.S. dollors)&#13;
in Argentina, for example, IFC acted as financial        3,500&#13;
adviser to the Ministry of Defense in the sale of a steel&#13;
manufacturer; it also completed a valuation of two       3,000&#13;
of Brazil's leading producers of petrochemicals. IFC&#13;
acted as financial adviser in the privatization of       2,500&#13;
enterprises in Czechoslovakia, Poland, and other         2,000&#13;
Central European countries. A pilot privatization        2,0&#13;
program involving the auction of small-scale             1,500&#13;
enterprises in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia, proved&#13;
very successful, and Russiani officials plan to use      1,000&#13;
it as a model for privatizations in other cities.&#13;
During the year, IFC worked on 30 technical assis-&#13;
tance projects related to capital market development.           1988    1989   1990   1991    1992&#13;

The Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS),&#13;
which is operated jointly by TFC, the IBRD, and&#13;
MIGA, provides advice to member countries on&#13;
attracting foreign direct investment. In fiscal 1992&#13;
FIAS completed 24 advisory assignments in 21&#13;
countries and one assignment in Central Europe.&#13;
FIAS's activities are described on p. 74.&#13;
IFC's operations are complemented by facilities that&#13;
help small-scale entrepreneurs develop business&#13;
proposals and raise financing for projects-the&#13;
Africa Project Development Facility, the Business&#13;
Advisory Service for the Caribbean and Central&#13;
America, the Polish Business Advisory Service,&#13;
and the South Pacific Project Facility. IFC helped&#13;
to establish these facilities, and is the executing&#13;
agency for all of them.&#13;

PRIVATE SECTOR STRATEGIES DIVISION&#13;
The Private Sector Strategies Division (PSSD), which became operational infiscal 1992, enhances IFC's contribution&#13;
to the VVorld Bank Group's country assistance programs, in particular with respect to private sector development,&#13;
byprovidinginputs toprivatesectorassessments (PSAs) of selected member countries. In thePSAs, the Bank Group&#13;
seeks to identifyconstraints toprivate sectoractivityandproposes elements of a strategyofor encouragingit. In working&#13;
with the IBRD to design an integrated strategy on private sector development, IFC draws on its considerable experi-&#13;
ence infinancingprivate enterprises, helpinggoverntnents with capital market development, and advisinggovern-&#13;
ments and state enterprises on privatization.&#13;
In fiscal 1992 PSSD completed inputs to PSAs of countries in all developing regions, as described in the Regional&#13;
Reports. It also coordinated IFCGs inputfor a W4'orld Bank Group paper on the lessons of privatization, discussed by&#13;
the Board of Directors in April 1992.&#13;
To help IFC ac-hieve greater consistency in its strategy and operations, PSSD supports JFC's investment departments&#13;
in reviews of'IBRD projects and country strategy papers, and in interactions with the IBRD's country departments.&#13;
Under the new structure that took effect on July 1, 1992, PSSD will be part of the Corporate Planning Department.&#13;

HELPING AFRICAN COMPANIES WITH FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT&#13;
Thie derivative-products market tends to be accessible only to highly rated companies in thle industrialized countries.&#13;
Companies in developing countries often find it difficult, if not impossible, to gain access to hedging instruments&#13;
that would enable them to better managefinancial risk. IFC helps companies in developing countries gain access to&#13;
risk-management techniques at a reasonable cost by arranging commodity, currency, and interest rate hedging&#13;
instruimentsfor them and providing credit enhancement to market counterparties.&#13;
In fiscal 1992 IFC undertook, for thefirst time, transactions involving commodity lending and intermiediation. It&#13;
approved a $140 million gold-linked loan, of which $100 million will be syndicated, tofinance the expansion of&#13;
Ashanti Goldfields Corporation (Ghana), Ltd., (AGC), a gold-mining company in Ghana. The loan, which carries&#13;
low nominal interest rates, will provide a natural hedge a,gainst the mine's extensive reserves and, with the use of&#13;
derivatives, will give the company someflexibility infixing a conversion pricefor gold on the loan.&#13;
In addition to the loan, IFC isprovidiugagold-hedginigfacility that will allow AGC to purchaseforward sale&#13;
and option contractsfrom international bunllion dealers, locking in a range of pricesfor most of its gold production.&#13;
The derivative instruments offered to AGC through thefacility are longer terrm than the one-yearforward contracts&#13;
currently available to it and are usually not available to metal producers in developing countries because of the level&#13;
of transfer risk. Bydevelopinga contracttual structure reducing the risk to dealers, IFC will enable AGC to hedge about&#13;
$100 million worth of annual gold sales, about half the company's gold production.&#13;
In conjunction with thefacility, IFC will advise the company on the use of derivative instruments and the effect on&#13;
corporatefinances of usinig a particular instrument at a given tinme. IFC will intermediate in the financial markets&#13;
the instruments selected by AGC.&#13;
IFC also arranged a swap for AGC ofa fixed-rate export credit loan off I0 million into U.S. dollars. The benefits&#13;
to the company were twofold. First, AGC eliminated the currency mismatch between its revenues, wvhich are in U.S.&#13;
dollars, and its debt-service payments in pounds sterling, reducing the impact of exchange rate movemnents on its net&#13;
income. Second, the swap enabled the company to lock in debt-service payments at a lowfixed interest rate. IFC&#13;
intermediated a similar currenicy swap for Ilotel Investmnemmts (Ghana) Limited durimigfiscal 1992.&#13;

AFRICA PROJECT DEVELOPMENT FACILTTY&#13;
The Africa Project Development Facility (APDF) provides advice to African entrepreneurs seeking to start new&#13;
businesses or diversify or expand existing ones. The Facility helps entrepreneurs to identify and prepare viable&#13;
projects. Although APDF does notfinanceprojects, it helps entrepreneurs obtain debt and equityfinancing&#13;
and identify business partners, foreign as well as domestic. Typically, projects assisted by APDF are small, with costs&#13;
rangingfrom $500,000 to $5 million. APDF has offices in Abidjan, Cote d'lvoire; Nairobi, Kenya; and Harare,&#13;
Zimbabwe. Fundingfor APDF's activities comes from IFC, UNDP, the African Development Bank, and the&#13;
governments of 15 industrialized countries. In addition, Brazil, India, and Israel make technical experts available&#13;
to APDF for short-term assignments.&#13;
During the twelve months endedDecember3l, 1991, APDFprovided advice on 23 projects with total investment costs&#13;
of $48 million; these projects will result in the creation of about 2,000 jobs. Four of the projects have women sponsors&#13;
or managers. Demandfor APDF's services continues to be strong: it received 500 project proposals in the course of&#13;
the year.&#13;
Since it was founded, APDF has assisted more than 100 projects with estimated costs of over $200 million, of&#13;
which it has helped raise $148 million. APDF-assisted projects have led to the creation of over 10, 000 new jobs in&#13;
23 countries.&#13;
EXAMPLES OF PROJECTS&#13;

MOZAMBIQ UE&#13;
Optimus Lamps, the first Mozambican company to receive assistance from APDF, is undertaking a $700,000&#13;
expansion program to manufacture paraffin stovesfor domestic and export markets. APDF also helped the sponsors&#13;

to cover the costs of trainingpersonnel. The project is expected to result in the creation of fourteen jobs. The sponsors&#13;
of this project set up a small manufacturing unit in Zimbabwe in 1990 with APDF assistance.&#13;

SPPF also helps sponsors locate appropriate technology and provides them with technical assistance during project&#13;
implementation. Funding for SPPF's activities is provided by IFC and the Governments ofAustralia, Canada, Japan,&#13;
and New Zealand. The Government of India has agreed to provide technical experts for short-term use by SPPE&#13;

strategy to support projects with a positive environmental impact. T he project, consisting of land preparation&#13;
and the planting of 5,000 hectares of indigenous tropical hardwood tree species, will eventually allow Enchapes&#13;

The companies are owned by the Durini Group, Ecuador's largest wood-processinggroup, which has made a strategic&#13;

for environmentally oriented investment projects in developing countries as part of an effort to help these countries to&#13;
address selected environmental problems that are global in scope.&#13;
The project will help increase forest cover levels in the project area and contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas&#13;
emissions through carbon sequestration. It will help to preserve and rehabilitate the regional ecosystem and to&#13;
conserve biodiversity; 610 hectares consistingprimarily of intact native tropical moist forest will be naintained as&#13;
ecological reserves, withformalstatus asprivateforest reserves. The reserves will also serveas a seedsourceforfuture&#13;
reforestation.&#13;
In an effort to involve the local community, Endesa and Botrosa will provide seedlings to localfarms and nurseries.&#13;
It is hoped that this will establish the basis for a viableforestry-based local economy while providing the companies&#13;
and other commercial purchasers with additional sources of wood in thefuture.&#13;
This project, one of thefirst of its kind, will demonstrate the commercial viability of sustainable tropical forestplan-&#13;
tations based largely ot indigenous hardwood treespecies andserve as a modelforsimilarprojects woyl,dwide. Nearly&#13;
allplantationforestry in tropical countries currently involves the use ofexotic species-such aspine and eucalyptus-&#13;
in monotypic plantations.&#13;
A GEF-funded research program will enhance the project's environmental impact by monitoring ancl documenting&#13;
thefollowing aspects: commercialforestry andforest ecology, biological diversity, carbon sequestration levels,&#13;
and socioeconomic conditions in the project area. Currently there is virtually no informationt available on tropical&#13;
plantations that use indigenous hardwood species. The research program will be implemented by the Durini Group's&#13;
private non-profitforestry research center, Fundaci6n Forestal J.M. Durini, with the assistance of local and&#13;
international research organizations. Itsfindings will be disseminated in Ecuador and internationally.&#13;

THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT ADVISORY SERVICE&#13;
In response to the strong interest of developing member countries in attractingforeign direct irivestment, IFC created&#13;
the Foreign InvestinentAdvisory Service (FAS) in 1986. After 1988, FIAS was operated jointly by lFC and&#13;
the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and in fiscal 1992 it was decided that FIAS should be&#13;
supervised by a committee chaired bylFC's Executive VicePresidentand consistingof representatives of IFC, MIGA,&#13;
and the IBRD.&#13;
Thisfiscal year, the Boards of IFC, MIGA, and the IBRD approved a proposal to provide thefunding necessary to&#13;
support FIAS's growing program, as well as to give greater flexibility to FIAS management. Under the new&#13;
arrangement, the IBRD will become a co-sponsor of FIAS. The General Manager of FIAS will be responsible for&#13;
day-to-day operations and for relations with governments on operational matters. Beginning infiscal 1993, the World&#13;
Bank Group will providefunds to cover approximately 50 percent of FIAS's costs, with IFC providing half of this&#13;
amount, and MIGA and IBRD each providing one-fourth. The remaining50percent will be covered by contributions&#13;
to the FIAS Trust Fund, fundingfrom bilateral and multilateral agencies, and clientfees.&#13;
To date, FIAS has worked in over 45 developing countries, advisinggovernments on the laws, policies, regulations,&#13;
and procedures needed to create an attractive investment climate and increase inflows of foreign direct investment.&#13;
In addition, FIAS helps governments to build effective institutional frameworks for interacting with investors, and&#13;
to develop investment promotion strategies. FIAS's primary objective is to help governments fill long-term develop-&#13;
mZent needs by getting the greatestpossible benefitfromforeign investment-not only capital, but also technology and&#13;
managerial expertise.&#13;
Duringfiscal 1992, FIAS completed 24projects in 21 countries, as well as one regionalproiect in Eastern and Central&#13;
Eturope. Twelve of theseprojects were in the poorest developing countries with annualper capita incornes of less than&#13;
$600. FIAS has been particularly active in sub-Saharan Africa. Details on FIAS's activities in specific countries can&#13;
be putnd in the regional chapters.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
TIHL ENVIRONMENT UNIT&#13;
The Environtnenit Unitplays an important role in IFC's operations. In addition to reviewingJFCprojectsfor&#13;
compliance with World Bank and international guidelines and with regulations in the host countries, the Environ-&#13;
ment Unit develops IFC's environmental policies and programs, and promotes private investment in environmental&#13;
projects in developing countries.&#13;
IFC projects are classified according to their potential environmental impact. Projects in category A have been&#13;
identified as having the potentialfor diverse and significant environmental impacts and require comprehensive&#13;
environmental assessments. Projects in category B may result in a specific environmental impact and must comply&#13;
with certain predetermined performance standards, guidelines, or design criteria to mitigate this impact. These&#13;
projects require an environmental analysis, rather than a comprehensive environmental assessment. Projects that&#13;
would not normally have an environmental impact (for example, certain types of capital markets projects) are&#13;
classified in Category C and do not require a detailed environmental review. During the year IFC continued to&#13;
strengthen proceduresfor reviewingprojects to ensure that environmental concerns are adequately addressed in all&#13;
IFC's operations.&#13;
The Environment Unit also promotes private sector involvement in environmental industries, which offer interesting&#13;
investment opportunities, particularlyfor companies providing clean technologies thatpreventpollution and waste&#13;
at thie source. To increase awvareness of these opportunities, IFC published a report on the market for environmental&#13;
goods and services in nine developing countries (Chile, Hungary, Indonesia, Malaysia, iMexico, Pakistan, Poland,&#13;
Thailand, and Turkey). The report, Investing in the Environment: Business Opportunities in Developing&#13;
Countries, was released in May 1992, in anticipation of the United Nations Conference on1 Environment and&#13;
Development (UNCED) in Rio de Taneiro in June 1992. The marketfor environmental goods and services is still in&#13;
its infancy in developitng countries, but is poisedfor rapid growth during the next decade. In fiscal 1992 the number&#13;
of inquiries and project proposals in this area increased substantially, particularly in connection with water supply&#13;
and waste water treattnent services, hiazardous waste disposal, and solid waste disposaL&#13;
In fiscal 1992 the Corporation received itsfirstgrantfrom the Global Environment Facility (GEF), a joint World&#13;
Bank-UNDP operation, for a reforestation project described on p. 58.&#13;

enables IFC to carry out, over an extended period                   --t&#13;
of time, a number of smaller structtured transactions                 1(&#13;
that can result in attractive sub-LIBOR funding&#13;
costs. It is thus intended to complement discrete&#13;
issues of publicly traded bonds. In fiscal 1992 IFC&#13;
launched two issues totaling $107 million under&#13;
the U.S. domestic MTN program. Both issues were                                       gIF(&#13;

Incorporated.                      ,'&#13;
IFC's total borrowing program for fiscal 1992 came       _                (&#13;
to $724 million, compared with $702 million in fiscal&#13;
1991. IFC borrowed $664 million in the internation-&#13;
al markets, compared with $598 million in fiscal&#13;
1991. The remaining $60 million was borrowed from&#13;
the IBRD, with which IFC has maintained a Master&#13;
Loan Agreement.&#13;
IFC's largest borrowing in fiscal 1992, as in previous&#13;
years, was a Eurodollar bond issue. The $300 million&#13;
benchmark issue, launched in November 1991, was&#13;
lead managed by Deutsche Bank Capital Markets&#13;
Ltd., with Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd. as joint-&#13;
lead manager. Other market borrowings in fiscal&#13;
1992 included the Corporation's second offerings in&#13;
both the Portuguese escudo bond market (Esc 11 bil-&#13;
lion-$76 million equivalent) and Swedish kronor&#13;
bond market (SKr 500 million-$86 million equiva-&#13;
lent), as well as a Spanish pesetas 10 billion ($95 mil-&#13;
lion equivalent) issue.&#13;
All market borrowings in fiscal 1992 were swapped&#13;
into variable-rate U.S. dollars to fund new loans&#13;
approved by IFC during the fiscal year. The sub-&#13;
LIBOR cost achieved through these swaps contrib-&#13;
uted significantly to the lowering of IFC's overall&#13;
funding costs.&#13;
IFC plans to access a wider range of public bond&#13;
markets in fiscal 1993, while limiting borrowings&#13;
from the IBRD to a modest percentage of total&#13;
borrowings. The Corporation will continue to&#13;
pursue its dual strategy of establishing liquid, well-&#13;
traded issues in the public markets while seeking to&#13;
achieve low-cost funding in the arbitrage markets,&#13;
for example, through issues under the recently&#13;
established MTN program.&#13;

CAPITAL INCREASE&#13;
In 1990 IFC's Board ofDirectors began to discuss thepotential long-term demandfor the Corporaton'sfinancing and&#13;
services, and the level of capital that would be required to meet that demand. After the very stronggrowth experienced&#13;
in the 1980s-an average of nearly20percentperyearin new investmentapprovals-it was clear thatIFC's existing&#13;
capital base was inadequate to meet the growing demand for assistance with private sector development.&#13;
As these discussions progressed, the private sector was being called upon to play an increasingly important role in the&#13;
economies of many developing countries. Tn Eastern Europe, centrally planned economies were being abandoned in&#13;
favor offi-ee tnarkets. In Latin Amer-ica and Asia, countries overburdened with debt began to privatize state-owned&#13;
industries, and large infrastructure proiects were entrusted to the private sector. In Africa, small-scale entrepreneurs&#13;
were being encouraged, as another means of reducing poverty on that continent.&#13;
Mindful of these challenges, IFC's Board of Directors encouraged the Corporation to maintain and increase its&#13;
support of the private sector in the 1990s. The Board concluded that special emphasis should be given to a number J&#13;
areas, including the mobilization of capital; privatization and restructuring; equity investments; domestic capital&#13;
markets; large projects in sectors in which governments are encouraging greater private sector involvement; and&#13;
support for small and mediumn-sized enterprises, especially in Africa and Eastern Europe. In addition, as described&#13;
in last year's report, steps were taken to strengthen the development impact of IFC's proiect activities and to improve&#13;
coordination forprivate sector support within the World Bank Group.&#13;
To helpfinance these activities, IFC's Board of Directors recommended tro the Board of Governors at the close of 1991&#13;
that IFC's capital be increased f-om $1.3 billion to $2.3 billion. The Governors approved the $1 billion capital increase&#13;
onl May 4, 1992, demonstrating strong membership support. Payments are scheduled to be made in annual tranches&#13;
from August 1992 to August 1996, enabling FC to expand its operations throughout the rest of the decade.&#13;

N O T E S  T O   F I N A N C I A L  S TAT E M E N T S&#13;
NOTE A-SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND RELATED POLICIES&#13;
The accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation are in conformity with generally accepted accounting&#13;
principles in the United States and with International Accounting Standards- The Corporation's assets and&#13;
liabilities are recorded principally on the historical cost basis, and the accrual method of accounting is followed,&#13;
except where otherwise noted.&#13;
Financial Statement Presentationi-Certain amounts in the pr-ior year have been reclassified to conform to the&#13;
current year's presentation.&#13;
Translation of Currencies-Assets and liabilities not denominated in United States dollars, with the exception of&#13;
disbursed equity investments, are expressed in United States dollars at the approximate exchange rates prevailing&#13;
at June 30, 1992, and June 30, 1991. Translation gains and losses are credited or charged to income. Disbursed&#13;
equitv investmcnts are expressed in United States dollars at the exchange rates which applied at the time of dis-&#13;
bursement.&#13;
Investmnents-Investment commitments are recorded when agreements are signed by the Corporation and are re-&#13;
flected as assets wvhen disbursed. Loan investments are generally carried at the principal amounts outstanding.&#13;
Equity investments are carried at cost. It is the Corporation's practice to obtain collateral security such as, but&#13;
not limited to, mortgages and third party guarantees.&#13;
Reserve against Losses-The reserve against losses represents managenment's judgment as to identifiable losses on&#13;
specific investments with a significant and relatively permanent decline in value, and an estimate of potential&#13;
losses not specifically provided for. The reserve is established through annual charges to income in the form of a&#13;
provision for losscs on investments. Investments written off, as well as any subsequent recoveries, are recorded&#13;
through the reserve.&#13;
Revenue Recognition-Dividends and profit participations are recorded as income when received in freely con-&#13;
vertible currencies. Gains on the sale of investments are measured against the average cost of the investments sold&#13;
and are credited to income when received in freely convertible currencies.&#13;
Interest and commitment fees are recorded as income on an accrual basis. All other fees are recorded as income&#13;
when received. The Corporation does not recognize income on loans where collectibility is in doubt or payments&#13;
of interest or principal are past due more than sixty days unless management anticipates that collection of inter-&#13;
est will occur in the near future. Any interest accrued on a loan placed in nonaccrual status is reversed out of cur-&#13;
rent income and is thereafter recognized as income only when actual payment is received. Interest not previously&#13;
recognized, but capitalized as part of a debt restructuring, is recorded as deferred income and credited to current&#13;
income only when the related principal maturity is received. Fees and costs associated with loan origination are&#13;
recognized when incurred as the net of these amounts is not material.&#13;
Deposits and Securlities-The Corporation's liquid assets are segregated into two pools wvhich are valued at either&#13;
cost or market. Both pools comprise instruments issued by government agencies and financial institutions and&#13;
are recorded on a trade date basis. Investments valued at cost arc usually hcld to maturity. lnvestments valued at&#13;
market are invested according to the Corporation's credit risk and duration policies. Gains and losses on sales of&#13;
securities valued at cost, as measured by the difference between cost on a last-in, first-out basis and proceeds of&#13;
the sales, are recorded as an element of income from deposits and securities. The Corporation classifies the cash,&#13;
deposits and securities portfolio as an element of liquidity in the Statement of Cash Flows, due to their nature&#13;
and the Corporation's policies governing the level and use of such investments.&#13;
QJT Balantce Sheet Financial Instrumenits-In the normal course of business, the Corporation is a party to off-&#13;
balance shcet financial instruments including currency and interest rate swap obligations on its own behalf and&#13;
89&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
for clients, guarantees for third parties, futures contracts, short sales and forward rate agreements. The Corpo-&#13;
ration follows the same credit policies in considering conditional obligations as it does for balance sheet instru-&#13;
ments. Associated income or expenses on swaps and forward agreements are recognized over the life of the&#13;
instrument. Gains and losses on futures contracts and short sales are recognized as an element of income from&#13;
deposits and securities.&#13;
Where it acts as a swap intermediary, the Corporation minimizes its exposure to credit risk by performing credit&#13;
reviews on the swap clients and minimizes its exposure to currency and interest rate risks by entering into off-&#13;
setting swap positions with market counterparties. Forward rate agreements may be executed as part of the Cor-&#13;
poration's overall management strategy for its securities portfolio.&#13;

At June 30, 1992, 50% (44.0%-1991) of the deposit and securities portfolio was valued at market. The remain-&#13;
der of the portfolio, which is usually held to maturity, comprises mostly time deposit instruments and govern-&#13;
ment securities having a duration of less than one year and is valued at cost which approximates market. T he&#13;
deposits and securities portfolio is denominated primarily in United States dollars with instruments in nondollar&#13;
currencies representing 7.6% of the portfolio at June 30, 1992 (7.1%-1991). At June 30, 1992 and 1991, cash&#13;
collateral invested and purchased securities not settled were valued at market, which approximates cost, and were&#13;
denominated in United States dollars.&#13;
At June 30, 1992, the Corporation had gross receivables from covered forward agreements at a book value of $664&#13;
million ($452 million-199 1) and gross payables from covered forward agreements at a book value of $704 mil-&#13;
lion ($446 million-1991). The Corporation's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by its&#13;
counterparties was $1.0 million at June 30, 1992 ($8.2 million-1991). At June 30,1992, the Corporation also&#13;
had futures contracts with a total contract value of $186 million (nil-1991) with minimal exposure to credit&#13;
loss. The Corporation is highly selective in its choice of counterparties and does not consider nonperformance&#13;
to represent a significant risk.&#13;
The Corporation has entered into short sales of securities not held in the Corporation's portfolio at the time of&#13;
the sale with a total contractvalue of $55.7 million at June 30, 1992 (nil-1991). The Corporation bears the risk&#13;
that the market value of the securities will move adversely between the time of the sale and the time the securities&#13;
must be delivered.&#13;
The Corporation also has entered into interest rate swap agreements on liquid assets with respect to notional&#13;
principal amounts of $82 million at June 30,1992 (nil-1991) under which it is obligated to make interest pay-&#13;
ments on a fixed rate basis in exchange for receiving variable rate payments. The differential to be paid or re-&#13;
ceived as interest rates change is recognized over the life of the agreement. Exposure to loss in the event of&#13;
nonperformance by countcrparties to these swap agreements is considered insignificant.&#13;

Principal and interest are payable in the currency borrowed. Under its borrowing agreements, the Corporation&#13;
is not permitted to mortgage or allow a lien to be placed on its assets (other than purchase money security in-&#13;
terests) without extendinig equivalent security to the holders of suclh borrowinigs.&#13;
'the $215 million net receivable on currency swaps at June 30, 1992, shown in the above table, consists of&#13;
swap transactions in net receivable positions of S225 million ($54 million-1991) and swap transactions in net&#13;
payable positions of $10 million ($57 million-1991); these amounts result from exchange rate movements&#13;
occurring subsequent to the date of the swap transactions. At June 30, 1992, the Corporation had gross receiv-&#13;
ables from borrowing-related currency swaps at a book value of$2,139 million ($1,549 millioni-1991) and gross&#13;
payables from borrowing-related currency swaps at a book value of $1,924 million ($1,552 million-1991). As&#13;
a result of the currency and interest rate swap transactions, the weighted average cost of market borrowings may&#13;
differ from the weighted average rates reflected in the table.&#13;
At June 30, 1992, the Corporation had gross receivables from asset/liability management currency swaps at a&#13;
book value of $100 million ($60 million-1991) and gross payables from asset/liability management currency&#13;
swaps at a book value of $113 million ($59 million-1991).&#13;

In addition, undrawn balances on committed borrowings from the IBRD were $246 million ($248 million-&#13;
199 1). A commitment fee is payable on the undrawn balanccs of borrowings at 3/4 of 1% per annum. For the&#13;
year ended June 30, 1992, such commitment fees aggregated $1.9 million ($1.7 million-1991) and are included&#13;
in the wveighted average cost of borrowings.&#13;
The Corporation has also entered into interest rate swap agreements with respect to notional principal amounts&#13;
of$ 1,705 million ($1,374 million-1991) under which it is obligated to make interest payments on a variable rate&#13;
basis, averaging 4.27% at June 30,1992, (6.46%-]991) in exchange for receiving fixed rate payments, averaging&#13;
8.39% at June 30, 1992, (8.67%-1991). The differential to be paid or received as interest rates change is recog-&#13;
nized over the life of the agreement.&#13;
The Corporation could be exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by its counterparties in the&#13;
aggregate amount of $274 million at June 30, 1992, ($52 million-1991) for outstanding currency swaps, and&#13;
$102 million ($29 million-1991) for outstanding interest rate swaps. These amounts represent the maximum&#13;
estimated replacement cost, at market rates, of those outstanding swaps in a gain position. However, the Corpo-&#13;
ration is highly selective in its choice of counterparties and does not consider nonperformance to represent a&#13;
significant risk.&#13;
The principal amounts repayable on borrowings outstanding in all currencies during the years ending June 30,&#13;

NOTE K-OTHER MATTERS&#13;
StaffRetirement Plan-The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) has a defined&#13;
benefit retirement Plan covering substantially all of the staff of the Corporation, the IBRD, and the Multilateral&#13;
Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). Under the Plan, benefits are based on years of service and average com-&#13;
pensation, with the staff contributing a fixed percentage of pensionable remuneration and the Corporation, the&#13;
IBRD, and MIGA contributing the remainder of the actuarially determined cost of funding future Plan benefits.&#13;
The total contribution is based upon the aggregate funding method. All contributions to the Plan and all other&#13;
assets and income held for purposes of the Plan are held separately from the other assets and income of the Cor-&#13;
poration, the IBRD, and MIGA and can be used only for the benefit of the participants in the Plan and their ben-&#13;
eficiaries, until all liabilities to them have been paid or provided for. The total expense allocated to the&#13;
Corporation for the year ended June 30, 1992, was $12.0 million ($8.3 million-1991).&#13;
Other Post-EmploymentBenefits-The IBRD also provides certain life insurance and medical benefits to substan-&#13;
tially all retired staff of the Corporation, the IBRD, and MIGA and their spouses through contributions to a Re-&#13;
tired Staff Benefits Plan (RSBP). Commencing in 1990, the Corporation, the IBRD, and MIGA began accruing&#13;
and funding, on an actuarially determined basis, the expected future cost of providing such benefits for future&#13;
retirees. All contributions to the RSBP and all other assets and income held for purposes of the RSBP are held&#13;
separately from the other assets and income of the Corporation, the IBRD, and MIGA and can be used only for&#13;
the benefit of the participants in the RSBP and their beneficiaries, until all liabilities to them have been paid or&#13;
provided for. The total expense allocated to the Corporation for the year ended June 30, 1992, was $1.6 million&#13;
($0.5 million-1991).&#13;
Land Acquisition and Building Construction-On July 22, 1992, the Corporation purchased land for $82 million&#13;
to construct a building for its own use.&#13;
Service and Support Payments-The Corporation obtains some administrative and overhead services from the&#13;
IBRD in those areas where common services can be efficiently provided by the IBRD. This includes shared costs&#13;
of the Boards of Governors and Directors, and other services such as internal auditing, administrative support,&#13;
office occupancy, supplies and insurance. Payments for these services are made by the Corporation to the IBRD&#13;
based on negotiated fees, direct chargeback, and allocated charges where chargeback is not feasible. Expenses&#13;
allocated to the Corporation for the year ended June 30, 1992, totalled $21.0 million ($20.0 million-1991).&#13;

            This report provides an overview of
            events covering the period July 1, 1991 to June 30, 1992,
            together with accompanying financial statements. The report
            also highlights the expansion of project financing
            operations and advisory activities in its developing member
            countries. With a capital increase of $1 billion, IFC
            intends to increase new investment approvals in all regions
            by 10 percent a year until 1998, bringing annual approvals
            to about $4 billion by the end of the decade. During fiscal
            1992, the groundwork was laid for the future expansion that
            will be required of IFC in view of its member countries
            growing need for support of their private sectors and the
            increase in its membership.
