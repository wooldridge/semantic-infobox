        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Argentine government privatized the
            water and sewerage services in greater Buenos Aires by
            concession. The utility was sold as a single monopoly
            business, but bidders had to compete for the right to
            provide service at the lowest price. Contractual targets for
            service coverage implied significant investment over the
            life of the contract. As things have turned out, the assets
            were in worse shape than expected, and a renegotiation rule
            has allowed a tariff hike to pay for accelerated investment.
            The authors argue, however, that the pricing system is still
            flawed, producing incentive problems for investment.
