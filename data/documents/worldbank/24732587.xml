COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENT&#13;
relating to&#13;
Global In rastructure Facility Partnership Program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
This Collaboration Arrangement is e itered into on  2015 between:&#13;
(1)   SUMITOMO MITSUI BANK NG CORPORATION, headquartered at 1-1-2, Marunouchi, C1 i) ol a-&#13;
ku, Tokyo, Japan, ("SMBC") and&#13;
(2)   THE WORLD BANK GROUP, comprising the INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR&#13;
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT ("IBRD") and INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPM Of&#13;
ASSOCIATION ("IDA"), heaJquartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington, DC 20433, US,  e&#13;
INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION, ("IFC") headquartered at 2121 Pennsylvan :&#13;
Avenue, NW, Washington, I C 20433, USA, and the MULTILATERAL INVESTMENT&#13;
GUARANTEE AGENCY, ("1IlGA"), headquartered at 1818 H Street, NW, Washington. DC 20 33,&#13;
USA (the "World Bank Group")&#13;
(each a "Party" and togethel, the "Parties").&#13;
Preamble&#13;
(A) There is broad internation I recognition, as confirmed by the G20, the OECD, Intern i ial&#13;
Organizations (IOs), the G7', and the private sector represented by the B20 that investin in-le&#13;
infrastructure of Emerging Plarkets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) is needed, to n x:: id&#13;
access to basic services an J raise living standards for all, and to meet global economic .110 th&#13;
targets.&#13;
(B) Meeting this need present; a significant financing challenge. Given constraints on E (s: ig&#13;
sources of infrastructure finince-particularly in the public sector-a redoubled and coort in ad&#13;
effort is needed to mobilize rivate sector finance for EMDE infrastructure.&#13;
(C) There is an absence of rob ist pipelines of structurally sound and bankable projects and t li: is&#13;
understood to be the greatef t barrier to achieving significantly more infrastructure investme r .&#13;
(D) Governments, development :inance institutions, donors, and private investors share an int( i in&#13;
developing the market for p ivate infrastructure finance in EMDEs: both on the demand , i( E in&#13;
the numbers of structurally s )und and bankable projects seeking finance, and gradual eme g ;e&#13;
of EMDE infrastructure as a recognized asset class; and the supply side, in the range of :iii te&#13;
investors that actively participate in financing those projects. Achieving these goals will :ii!r fit&#13;
from collective action between this range of entities-to leverage resources and knowleI,]c to&#13;
find solutions to complex nfrastructure financing challenges that no single institution ix Id&#13;
achieve alone.&#13;
(E) In support of these goals, tho Parties propose the establishment of a Global Infrastructure la ci ty&#13;
Partnership Program ("GIF"]. The GIF will be an open global platform aiming at leveragi I ie&#13;
efforts of the wide range of institutions currently engaged in supporting EMDE infrastructu ' is th&#13;
the participation of private infrastructure investors, coalescing around project prepE,"It, n,&#13;
structuring, and  risk mitigatiDn for individual infrastructure investments. In this regard, tt ,=  IF&#13;
aims to complement existin ) and proposed services and initiatives currently supported :- ie&#13;
Parties and other prospective GIF partners. The GIF intends to provide resources to prepar   w II-&#13;
structured, infrastructure projects, and to serve as an additional mechanism for accessi II le&#13;
expertise of the Parties and other GIF partners, in combination with guidance from prosIe c: le&#13;
private sector financiers into project structures. The GIF thereby aims to achieve greater le 1'n: le&#13;
of official resources in the ft ce of substantial EMDE infrastructure needs-in particular fo ai le&#13;
and complex projects with th B potential to attract significant private capital.&#13;
(F) The Parties are now intere.ted in collaborating in developing the Global Infrastructure la ci ty&#13;
Partnership Program, togeth )r with other partners.&#13;
2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
Accordingly, the Parties have corr e to the following understanding:&#13;
1     Global Infrastructure Facil ty Partnership Program Framework&#13;
1.1   The GIF is intended to be based on the preliminary objectives and principles set OL n1&#13;

understanding that while the GIF Foundational Principles are an initial basis for their collab:ii a:n,&#13;
they are of an indicative nati re and will continue to be developed amongst the Parties and / th&#13;
other potential partners until the GIF is formally established. The final version of these obje t : 3&#13;
and principles will be agreed upon by the GIF Partners and be reflected in the agreement&#13;
establishing the GIF.&#13;
1.2   The Parties intend tc work together with any additional participants who may be&#13;
collaborating on the GIF to fi irther enhance their coordination, in particular by developing th) C F,&#13;
with a view to formally estab ishing the program by June 2015.&#13;
2     Further Collaboration&#13;
2.1    Pursuant to the fore!loing, the Parties will use reasonable endeavors to continue to&#13;

ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
Annex 1&#13;
Preli minary GIF Foundational Principles&#13;
1     Objectives&#13;
1.1   The objective of the GIF is to promote private sector investment in infrastructure pr :j:  s&#13;
in emerging markets and de feloping economies (EMDEs) through robust project preparatic n1&#13;
provision of appropriate risk mitigation instruments, and thereby increasing the commercial : -ic&#13;
institutional investor engagenent in the EMDE infrastructure market. It is focused on&#13;
collaboration in complex put lic-private partnerships and projects with potential for commern i, I&#13;
viability which require projec preparation resources, policy dialogue and eventual infrastruc 1A r&#13;
financing solutions that no siigle institution could achieve alone.&#13;
1.2   To this end, the GIF aims to create a global platform to provide financial and coordi it &gt;n&#13;
resources in collaboration with the project preparation, advisory, and financing efforts of the 3i: -&#13;
range of donor and developr ient finance institutions currently engaged in supporting EMDE&#13;
infrastructure, with the input 3nd ideas of private infrastructure investors. GIF's engagemen cc Id&#13;
stretch from upstream suppc rt on project definition, preparation, and investment feasibility&#13;
assessment, through to dow istream transaction preparation, financial structuring, and risk&#13;
mitigation/credit enhanceme it.&#13;
1.3   Over the longer terrr, by contributing to the stock of high quality and well-structurec&#13;
infrastructure projects, the G F can be expected to help in the development of EMDE&#13;
infrastructure as an asset class attractive to a wide range of private investors seeking long- )r&#13;
assets in faster growing economies, but which until now have been presented only limited&#13;
infrastructure investment opportunities that meet their risk tolerance and investment profiles&#13;
2     Operating Principles&#13;
2.1   The GIF intends to c perate according to the following core principles, to be finalize( I p )n&#13;
agreement among GIF partn 3rs:&#13;
(i) Leveraging the private sector-specializing in project financing modalities th, t wI&#13;
draw together cc mparative advantages of public and private sectors;&#13;
(ii) Addressing public goods-focusing on core infrastructure; particularly those&#13;
infrastructure projects that are climate friendly or trade enabling;&#13;
(iii) Promoting sustainability and inclusiveness-ensuring projects adhere to be ;&#13;
practice standan Is for social and environmental responsibility; and&#13;
(iv) Collaborating, complementing and partnering for solutions-mobilizing tec n il al&#13;
and financial res)urces of all partner entities-World Bank Group entities, multi a:e al&#13;
development ins:itutions, other public institutions, and private investors-in an&#13;
innovative and fl )xible way, to complement existing capacities, achieve greater&#13;
leverage and address the complex infrastructure financing challenges that are&#13;
beyond the reso irces of any individual partner.&#13;
3     Institutional Arrangements and Governance&#13;
3.1   The GIF is expected to involve a wide range of stakeholders who are involved in th(&#13;
development and implementition of infrastructure projects, both public and private. GIF par n&#13;
are expected to fall into one or more of the following categories:&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
(i) Funding Partnt rs-Partners that provide financial contributions to the GIF wil te&#13;
considered Funding Partners.&#13;
(ii) Technical Partners-Partners that can and who will agree to provide specific&#13;
technical advice and support to GIF activities including execution of GIF-funde(&#13;
activities and/or provision of GIF-backed credit enhancement or liquidity suppo t&#13;
instruments.&#13;
(iii) Advisory Partn rs-Private investors or entities that represent the voice of&#13;
commercial and or institutional investment, whether pension funds, insurance&#13;
companies, sovoreign wealth funds, banks or other financial institutions, as we :&#13;
other multilatera or bilateral agencies engaged in supporting private sector&#13;
infrastructure projects, to be invited into discussions related to project preparat:&gt; i,&#13;
optimal approac ies to financial structuring, and the design and use of risk&#13;
instruments, with a view to ensure suitability of projects for commercial and/or&#13;
institutional inve 3tment.&#13;
3.2   A GIF Governing C 3uncil is proposed to oversee the GIF's strategic programming,&#13;
management and use of fun,is, and development of operational policies and procedures; ai c&#13;
hold the GIF Management Unit (see section 4.1) accountable for delivering on the facility's&#13;
objectives and principles, with advice and support from the Advisory Partners. The compos li:i of&#13;
the Governing Council will bo agreed between IBRD and prospective partners, but is propo -c o&#13;
comprise representatives of -unding and Technical Partners.&#13;
3.3    An Advisory Council comprised of all GIF partners, chaired by the Managing Dire it:i&#13;
and Chief Financial Officer o: the World Bank Group, will be periodically convened to facilit, t!&#13;
coordination of GIF activities and support GIF operations. This Advisory Council will serve s E&#13;
sounding board, providing guidance and support for GIF Management, and in particular witl ,:&#13;
view to ensuring suitability o projects for private sector investment.&#13;
4     Management&#13;
4.1   The GIF will be adm nistered by the World Bank Group, through a small, dedicated : ai i&#13;
established for this purpose the GIF Management Unit). The GIF Management Unit widl fur:: cn I&#13;
as a coordinating body as pr)jects are identified for inclusion in the pipeline, and then move&#13;
toward technical support anc financing phases. The GIF Management Unit will not lead indi ,i:1 al&#13;
projects.&#13;
4.2   GIF activity implemeltation teams will be led by selected staff of Technical Partner&#13;
institutions, coordinated by the GIF Management Unit in consultation with client governmen s&#13;
according to specific project equirements and the project origination processes. Compositi:&gt; f&#13;
the implementation teams m 3y vary according to the need of individual projects and goverr n E ts.&#13;
5     Activities and Projects&#13;
5.1   Project selection ct iteria and processes could be developed to reflect the followi -1&#13;
principles:&#13;
(i) Development Iripact-projects that support the development goals of the GIF&#13;
partner institutions;&#13;
(ii) Alignment-prc ects that are aligned with recipient/sponsor country priorities a iI&#13;
strategies;&#13;
(iii) Complexity-pr :jects that require multiple parties to come together to provide&#13;
structuring, arrar ging and financial support, and/or projects which require a ble &lt;&#13;
financial instrum ants; and&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Execution Version&#13;
(iv) Catalytic Impact-projects that have significant potential to achieve financial, i;t ity,&#13;
leverage public :unds, and attract private sector and/or institutional investors- ic&#13;
as through Publ c-Private Partnership (PPP) modalities-while still meeting&#13;
government's service delivery objectives.&#13;
The GIF will focus on infrast[ucture investments that have global public good characteristic ;, si ch&#13;
as climate friendly-projec s that are low emitting or encourage efficiency in the provision a&#13;
infrastructure services; and trade enabling-projects that facilitate or enhance interconnec:i i&#13;
and trade.&#13;
5.2   The scope of supp )rt provided to a particular project will be defined flexibly, with I .i w&#13;
to complementing the resou ces and support already available from partner entities and otl e,&#13;
funding mechanisms. During the GIF pilot phase, this support may include the following ac V tI s,&#13;
corresponding to major proje ct development stages:&#13;
(i) Project definitior and enabling environment - sector planning and investment&#13;
prioritization; project definition, including needs analysis and pre-feasibility scre :' g;&#13;
and legal, regulitory, or institutional reforms;&#13;
(ii) Project preparat on and investment feasibility - feasibility studies, investment&#13;
appraisal, and FPP structuring;&#13;
(iii) Transaction sup )ort and financial structuring - preparing and implementing&#13;
transactions, an J design of risk mitigation/credit enhancement packages; and&#13;
(iv) Financial arrang ng and credit enhancement - arranging and mobilizing financir g&#13;
packages from  range of sources and partners.&#13;
6     Operational Policies&#13;
Sound operational policies- including in particular the management of environmental and s:)::i:&#13;
impacts and risks, and trans arency in procurement-are critical to the success of infrastru:1&#13;
projects in supporting sustainable, inclusive development; as well as for investors in those&#13;
projects to manage financial reputational and legal risks. In developing the appropriate&#13;
framework for GIF-supportell operations, the GIF could draw upon existing arrangements ft r&#13;
external implementing entities under World Bank Partnership Programs. GIF partners will&#13;
collaborate to establish an a proach to fiduciary, environmental and social safeguards and :) hi r&#13;
standards and policies, and levelop, manage and oversee an accreditation process for GIF&#13;
Technical Partners who are expected to function as implementing entities for GIF activities.&#13;
